The journal was founded to serve the interests of the students, the bench, and the bar of the S tate of Utah . Since then, its scope has expanded to include legal issues of both national and international importance. The Society is a wholly student -run organization, wit h the student -editors making a ll editor ial and organizational decisions .

He was extraordinary in all the areas that are important for an academic life. He was an excellent teacher, a nationally renowned scholar, and an exemplary administrator, serving as Dean at both Utah and Cornell. More than thi s, Lee was a consummate gentleman. He greeted everyone with a smile and treated everyone with courtesy. I remember a colleague once saying that he felt better when Lee told him \" no\" than when other administrators told him \" yes.\" As Michael McConnell noted in his introduction to Lee's Festschrift, his impeccable manners were a manifestation of an underlying ethical commitment to the worth of every human life. Lee felt deeply that everyone, everyone, was entitled to respect , and his manners were an expression of that respect. As a scholar, he entered the field of family law when, in the words of Michael McConnell, it was something of a backwater, and his work contributed to its transformation into a field that encompasses some of the most interesting and pass ionately debated issues of our time. His work was also innovative in its embrace of interdisciplinarity and empirical research. For an introduction to his contributions to legal scholarship, I refer you to volume 2006, issue number 1, of the Utah Law Revie w, which is a Festschrift to Lee's work. He was also the moving force behind the creation of the Journal of Law and Family Studies, which has now been incorporated into the Utah Law Review. Beyond all this, Lee was a dear friend and mentor. Always interested in whatever you were working on, he also always pushed you to think more deeply about the subject. He had a wicked sense of humor and was the master of understatement; I still cherish a collection of witty memos from when he was Dean and my favo rite remains this one: \"It appears that there is no need for the faculty meeting scheduled for this Wednesday. Nonetheless, it will be canceled.\" Lee left us much too soon and we are all the poorer for his passing. Debora Threedy Spring 2014 Debora Threedy is Lee E. Teitelbaum Endowed Professor of Law at the University of Utah S.J. Quinney College of Law. Professor Threedy's scholarship ranges across several substantive areas, but her focus is on issues of power and subordination in the context of gender, race , and class. ii UTAH LAW REVIEW VOLUME 2014 NUMBER 3 SUBMISSIONS : The Utah Law Review welcomes submissions of unpublished manuscripts .

The Occupy Wall Street movement in 2011 not only highlighted growing income and wealth inequality in the United States, but also pointed the blame at governmental policies that favor business interests and the wealthy due to their outsized influence on politicians. Numerous economists and political scientists agree with this thesis. However, in focusing ire on the political branches and big business, these critiques have largely overlooked the role of the judiciary in fostering economic inequality. The Court 's doctrine touches each of the major causes of economic inequality, which include s systemic failures of our educational system, a frayed social safety net, probusiness policies at the expense of consumers and employees, and the g rowing influence of money in politics. In each of these areas, the Court 's deference to legislative judgments is highly selective and driven by a class -blind view of the law that presumes that market -based results are natural, inevitable, and beneficial. For instance, the Court rejects government attempts to voluntarily desegregate schools, while deferring to laws that create unequal financing for poor school districts. The end result is that poor children receive subpar educations, dooming many of them to the bottom of the economic spectrum. Similarly, the Court overturned Congress's attempt to rein in campaign financing, while upholding state voter identification laws that suppress the votes of the poor. These decisions distort the electoral process in favor of the wealthy. In short, the Court tends to defer to laws that create economic inequality, while striking down legislative attempts to level the playing field. While a popular conception of the Court is that it is designed to protect vulnerable minorit ies from majoritarian impulse, the Court , instead, is helping to protect a very powerful minority at the expense of the majority. This Article is one step to ward understanding how law intertwines with politics and economics to create economic inequality. * \u00a9 2014 Michele Gilman.

OWS shined a spotlight on the fact that t he top 1% of households currently earn s one-fifth of the nation 's income , 4 while owning over one-third of the nation' s wealth.5 Meanwhile, incomes for the other 99 % are at their lowest point since 1997, and these Americans face less social mobility, rising unemployment, and job insecurity .6 Simultaneously, poverty rates have increased, and nearly one -third of all Americans have either fallen into poverty or live on earnings that classify them as low income.7 These sobering facts undermine our 1 MARTIN GILENS , AFFLUENCE AND INFLUENCE : ECONOMIC INEQUALITY AND POLITICAL POWER IN AMERICA 1 (2012) (quoting Justice Brandeis). 2 See James Miller, Is Democracy Still in the Streets? , in THE OCCUPY HANDBOOK 173, 174 (Janet Byrne & Robin Wells eds., 2012). 3 Stephen Gandel, The Leaders of a Leaderless Movement , in WHAT IS OCCUPY ?

Twenty -eight percent of the population fell into poverty for at least two months between 2009 and 2010, although chronic spells of poverty lasting over twenty -four months were uncommon at 4.8%. Id. at 4. One -third of Americans had income below 200% of the 392 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 vision of America as a meritocracy, where people get what they deserve through hard work and initiative. The OWS movement contends that this widening economic gap results from a tainted political system in which the government hands out tax breaks, bail outs, and other financial advantages to banks, business enterprises , and the super rich due to their outsized influence on politicians .8 OWS echoes prominent economists and political scientists who assert that rising economic inequality is not solely the result of market forces, but also government policies. Yet, in focusing its ire on the political branches and big business , these critiques have largely overlooked the role of the judiciary in upholding laws and legal principles that foster inequality. After all, politicians pass laws, but courts uphold them. Accordingly, this Article examines the role of the Supreme Court in i nterpreting laws that impact economic inequality. Economists have identified at least four major factors contributing to the sharp rise in economic inequality since the 1980s, although there is disagreement about the weight and significance of these facto rs. First, our educational system is not producing students with the skills to succeed in a technologically based economy in which low -skill jobs have been replaced by computers or moved overseas due to globalization.9 Second, we have a frayed social safety net with limited redistribution to people at the bottom of the economic ladder.10 Third, our poverty threshold, which is considered low income. Id. at 17 -18. Many of these families are working; \"in 2011, more than 7 in 10 low -income families and half of all poor families were working. They s imply did not earn enough money to pay for basic living expenses.\" BRANDON ROBERTS ET AL ., LOW-INCOME WORKING FAMILIES : THE GROWING ECONOMIC GAP 3 (2013), available at http://www.workingpoorfamilies.org/wp -content/uploads/2013/ 01/Winter -2012_2013- WPFP to Blame? , in WHAT IS OCCUPY ?, supra note 3, at 64, 64 -65; Nouriel Roubini, Economic Insecurity and Inequality Breed Political Instability , in THE OCCUPY HANDBOOK , supra note 2, at 150, 150- 151. 9 CONG.

QUART . 955, 969 (2005) (argu ing that one reason the United States has greater income inequality than other developed nations is a weaker income support system); see also Barbara Ehrenreich & John Ehrenreich, The Making of the American 99 Percent and the Collapse of the Middle Class , in THE OCCUPY HANDBOOK , supra note 2, at 300, 304 (explaining that the middle class is vulnerable to economic dislocation because the welfare safety net is so limited). 2014] A COURT FOR THE ONE PERCENT 393 public policies favor business interests over consumers and employees .11 Fourth, these probusiness policies are shaped by the growing influence of money in politics and a corresponding disengagement from the poli tical process by middle - and low -income citizens.12 Suffice to say , there are hundreds of Supreme Court decisions that touch upon these political and economic trends, and given the wide array of substantive law that is implicated, not all of the cases follow the same narrative. Nevertheless, in each of these four areas, Court doctrine has reinforced economic inequality. Pulling back and taking a broad view of the Court 's rulings in these areas helps identify patterns in the Court 's decision making that might otherwise appear isolated. In brief , the Court 's deference to legislative judgments is highly selective and driven by a class -blind view of the law . Sometimes, the Court defers to government laws and policies that harm the economic interests of the 99 %. Other times, the Court rejects legislative attempts to redistribute societal benefits , while presuming that market -based results are natural , inevitable, and beneficial. Either way, the outcome is bad for economic equality. For instance, the Court rejects government attempts to voluntarily desegregate schools, while deferring to laws that result in unequal financing for rich and poor school districts. The end result is that poor children receive subpar educations, dooming many of them to the bottom of the economic spectrum. Similarly, the Court rejected Congress 's attempt to rein in campaign financing, while upholding state voter identification laws that suppress the votes of the poor. These deci sions distort the electoral process in favor of the wealthy. While a popular conception of the Court is that it is designed to protect vulnerable minorities at the hands of majoritarian impulse, the Court , instead, is helping to protect a very powerful minority at the expense of the majority. This Article is one step to ward understanding how law intertwines with politics and economics to create economic inequality . Part I describes the rise of economic inequality since the 1970s and identifies the main c auses for this divergence, each of which is linked to governmental policies . Part II analyzes how Supreme Court doctrine has reinforced economic inequality in the areas of education, redistribution, corporate l aw, and the political process. This Part exami nes the reasoning underlying the Court 's doctrine and reveals that the Court ignores the connection between government policies and inequality and defers to market -based outcomes as \" natural \" and desirable. Part III explores reasons why the Supreme Court m aintains its class- blind view of the law in the face of economic reality to the contrary. It explains why the Justices , who are not subject to the corrupting influence of money in politics , nevertheless favor the interests of the 1%. Part III concludes by suggesting ways that progressive lawyers can work to reform law in order to create greater economic equality. 11 See JOSEPH E.

The Rise of Economic Inequality We are living in an era of rising income inequality , driven by rapid growth in income among the top 1% of our income distribution.13 These Americans currently earn on e-fifth of the nation 's income ,14 or put different ly, in one week, the top 1% earn more than the bottom one-fifth earn in a year.15 Income is superconcentrated at the pinnacle of the scale, where \"the top [0.1%] received in a day and a half about what the bottom 90[ %] received in a year. \"16 Meanwhile, w ages for most Americans have stagnated.17 While the top 1% saw their after -tax household income grow by 275% between 1979 and 2007, the middle of the income distribution had only a 40% increase, and the bottom 20% had an abysmal 18% increase.18 Even as the country slowly emerges from the 2007 recession and its aftereffects, the top 1% is outpacing everyone else; they have amassed 93% of the income gains between 2009 and 2010.19 Wealth inequality is even starker.20 The top 1% own \"more than a third of the nation 's wealth \"21 or \"225 times the wealth of the typical American ,\" a ratio that is double what it was in both 1962 and 1983.22 13 See CBO REPORT , supra note 9, at xi (providing statistics to show that income rose much more for households at the higher end of the income scale than those in the middle and lower end of the income scale). 14 See TIMOTHY NOAH, THE GREAT DIVERGENCE 147 (2012); STIGLITZ , supra note 11, at 2; see also note 4, at 3. 15 See STIGLITZ , supra note 11, at 4.

The Causes of Economic Inequality OWS contends that this rising economic inequality results from government policies that aid the super wealthy and businesses due to the outsized influence of money in the political process. 30 There is ample social science and economic research to support this thesis.31 Nobel Prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that inequality is not solely the result of market forces; rather, \" government policies have been central to the creation of i nequality in the United States.\"32 Economist Rebecca Blank concurs, noting that \"the political system shapes economic outcomes.\"33 Political scientist Larry Bartels similarly states that \"politics . . . profoundly shapes economics,\"34 and overlooking this connection \"discourages systematic critical scrutiny of \" inequality.35 Political scientists Jacob 23 PAGE & JACOBS , supra note 6, at 7; see also Frank Levy & Peter Temin, Inequality and Institutions in 20th Century America 2-3 (Nat'l Bureau o f Econ.

Technology and globalization have reduced the number of moderate and low -skilled jobs, pushing those workers into the low - paying service sector, while creating jobs for high ly skilled, educated workers.41 Yet, America is not producing enough college graduates to keep up with the change, and the government is doing little to hold down college tuitions that make higher education out of reach for many middle -class and lower -incom e families.42 Moreover, the government has not reined in market failures that have led to excessive rent seeking by large corporations.43 For instance, the federal gov - ernment failed to regulate derivatives, banks then benefited from a lack of transparency in their sale, and the market was deprived of information and 36 HACKER & PIERSON , supra note 6, at 44; see also DAVID BRADY , RICH DEMOCRACIES , POOR PEOPLE : HOW POLITICS EXPLAIN POVERTY 6 (2009) (a sociologist explains that \"the distribution of resources in states and markets is inherently political\"). 37 See CBO REPORT , supra note 9, at 7 (summarizing a study that computed Gini indexes using before -tax, after -tax measure of household cash); NOAH, supra note 14, at 113 (noting the \"stunning increase in pretax income share for the wealthiest Americans\" not as a result of direct government redistribution, but indirect government intervention as a result of \"institutions and norms\"); P AGE & JACOBS , supra note 6, at 5 -7 (comparing inequality in \"take home pay\" as one factor contributing to the remaking of the overall distribution of income). 38 See STIGLITZ , supra note 11, at 65 (arguing that strong worker protections could correct an imbalance in economic power). 39 Id. at 57 -58. 40 NOAH, supra note 14, at 127 (noting that union membership is now only 7% of the private sector workforce). 41 Id. at 77; S TIGLITZ , supra note 11, at 54. 42 See NOAH, supra note 14, at 89; S TIGLITZ , supra note 11, at 55 -56; Alice Karekezi, What Caused the Wealth Gap?, SALON (Oct. 11, 2011, 9:40 AM), http://www.salon.com/2 011/10/11/what_caused_the_wealth_gap ( Jeffrey Sachs explaining that low social an d economic mobility stems from the difficulty of obtaining an advanced degree, and thus a good position in the economy, if one's parents do not have an advanced degree) . 43 See STIGLITZ , supra note 11, at 34, 39- 51 (describing the financial sector as using \"its political muscle to make sure that the market failures were not corrected\") ; Levy & Temin, supra note 23, at 6 (the impacts of technology and trade \"are embedded in a larger institutional story\" of post -1980 abandonment of prolabor institutions and deregulation).

The political branches deregulated the financial industry, the market then collaps ed,45 and the government stepped in to bail out the banks for their own misbehavior. In other words, \"[t]he financial world was reaping the benefit of high- risk, largely unregulated trading while offloading its losses onto the government.\"46 These \"bubble economies, \" associated with massive gains to people at the top of leading sectors are unstable and \" are no longer a plausible way to generate economic growth. \"47 Another high- profile example of corporate rent seeking is exorbitant CEO compensation; in 2010 the ratio of CEO compensation to that of a typical worker was 243 to 1.48 American CEOs earn two to three times more than their European counterparts.49 Legislative efforts to rein in executive pay have been weak, impacted by corporate lobbying.50 Other forms of rent seeking that government has failed to restrain and that have contributed to economic inequality include monopolistic behaviors,51 predatory lending,52 government subsidies to business,53 regulatory capture,54 and rules that protect companies from fore ign competition.55 Tax policy has also disproportionately benefitted the top 1% .56 President Reagan pushed the top tax bracket down from 70% to 28%, and it has stayed between 35% and 40% since then.57 The top 1% is not only earning bigger paychecks, but is also taxed less heavily than they were during the era of economic equality.58 This economic inequality is neither inevitable nor natural; rather, government policies play a role in generating economic inequality. 44 STIGLITZ , supra note 11, at 3 5-36. 45 See LAWRENCE LESSIG , REPUBLIC LOST: HOW MONEY CORRUPTS CONGRESS \u2014 AND A PLAN TO STOP IT 67-86 (2011); H ACKER & PIERSON , supra note 6, 68 -70; NOAH, supra note 14, at 160 -62. 46 NOAH, supra note 14, at 186. 47 GALBRAITH , supra note 15, at 148- 49. 48 STIGLITZ , supra note 11, at 3. 49 HACKER & PIERSON , supra note 6, at 62 -63; NOAH, supra note 14, at 152. 50 HACKER & PIERSON , supra note 6, at 64 -65, 221. 51 STIGLITZ , supra note 11, at 43-47 52 Id. at 36 -37. 53 Id. at 40; N OAH, supra note 14, at 172 (\"Congress was busy extending copyright terms and patent monopolies and turning over public lands to mining and timber companies for below -market fees.\"). 54 STIGLITZ , supra note 11, at 47 -48. 55 Id. at 50. 56 See id. at 71 -74 (discussing how tax policies are less restrictive for the top). 57 NOAH, supra note 14, at 110. 58 See HACKER & PIERSON , supra note 6, at 4 8.

The Impacts of Economic Inequality While conservatives and liberals largely agree that income inequality is on the rise,59 they disagree over whether this is a bad thing. Liberals recognize that some level of economic inequality is an integral part of capitalism but contend that current levels of inequality \u2014significantly higher than in other advanced, industrialized, democratic nations \u2014are too extreme.60 By contrast, for con- servatives, inequality is a necessary motivator for citizens to work hard, innovate, and create wealth.61 Yet, we are at the point at which the level of inequality is more than what is needed to maximize output.62 For most middle -income and low - wage jobs in our economy, effort and skill do not matter; workers are instead motivated by fear of losing their jobs and becoming des titute. 63 In fact, higher American worker productivity has not led to wage gains for the middle class; only the top 10% saw their incomes benefit from increases in worker productivity.64 It does not appear that the megarich need additional pay as 59 PAGE & JACOBS , supra note 6, at 9 -10 (\"The basic facts about economic inequality are rock solid.

Economic inequality injures the economy through \" lower productivity, lower efficiency, lower growth, [and] more instability,\"68 as the top 1% gain a larger slice of the pie without increasing the size of the pie. By contrast, across nations, economic equality is associated with longer and more sustained growth.69 Income inequality played a role in the 2008 collapse of the market, as middle -class Americans relied on debt to stay afloat.70 Large gaps between the rich and the poor are also associated with a wide array of social dysfunctions, such as higher rates of infant mortality and crime, less educational attainment, and lower life business sector productivity increased by 67.4%, yet median weekly earnings of full -time workers rose only 14%). 65 See Freeman, supra note 61, at 82 -83 (\"[M]any of the ways in which top earners make their money in response to incentives are counterproductive . . . .\"). 66 See STIGLITZ , supra note 11, at xiv -xv (arguing that the wealth of the elite and wealthy seemed to arise out of their ability to take advantage of others). 67 STIGLITZ , supra note 11, at xv; see also John Cassidy, What Good is Wall Street? in THE OCCUPY HANDBOOK , supra note 2, at 54, 72 (reviewing studies showing that \"people in the financial sector are overpaid\"). 68 STIGLITZ , supra note 11, at 117. 69 See DARON ACEMOGLU & JAMES A.

Given the downsides of inequality, why have the legislative and executive branches enacted policies that favor the interests of business and the wealthy over the average American? There are multiple explanations, most of which converge on growing pol itical polarization and the role of money in politics. The rise of political polarization and partisanship tracks the rise of income inequality.76 Republicans favor policies that foster inequality, and they have not only held control through much of this ti me period, but their dominance has also pushed Democrats rightward.77 Nevertheless, the top 1% have done staggeringly well through both Republican and Democratic administrations, and neither party is immune to the need to raise money to obtain and stay in power. 78 Moreover, studies show that politicians of both parties are most responsive to affluent voters and ignore the opinions of citizens at the bottom of the income ladder. 79 Through lobbying and campaign contributions, business interests and wealthy indiv iduals 71 See RICHARD WILKINSON & KATE PICKETT , THE SPIRIT LEVE L: WHY GREATER EQUALITY MAKES SOCIETIES STRONGER 81, 108- 13, 134- 37 (2009); Richard H.

Yet , when such policies and practices that contribute to economic inequality are challenged in the courts, the S upreme Court generally upholds them. Accordingly, the next Part places the Supreme Court within this narrative of the government's role in creating and maintaining economic inequality. The judiciary is the missing piece of the inequality puzzle. II. THE SUPREME COURT AND ECONOMIC INEQUALITY The major causes of economic inequality all intersect with law and, specifically, with Supreme Court doctrine. This Part traces how the Supreme Court has contributed to economic inequality by denying social or econom ic rights for people at the bottom of the income scale; favoring the interests of business over consumers and employees; refusing to recognize a constitutional right to education; and allowing money to drive the electoral system. A. Redistribution and t he Social Safety Net The Court adheres to three core principles when it directly confronts issues of class. First, the Constitution does not create or guarantee social or economic rights.80 Second, the poor are not a suspect class, and thus , discrimination on the basis of wealth does not warrant heightened review.81 Third, laws that impact the poor are a type of economic legislation subject to rational basis review.82 As a result of these interlocking principles, poor people generally must secure any governme ntal assistance through the political process, yet they often fare badly in the legislative realm due to their lack of political influence and a societal distaste for and distrust of the poor. \"The more generous a welfare state, the more people are protect ed from the economic insecurity and instability of markets.\"83 Unfortunately for the poor in America, our welfare state is less egalitarian than in other developed nations. 84 As political scientists have shown, Congress is entirely unresponsive to the politi cal preferences of the poor. As a result of the recent 80 See DeShaney v. Winnebego Cnty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 196 (1989) (holding that there is no constitutional duty to protect children from their abusive parents after receiving reports of possible abuse). 81 See San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 18- 37 (1973) (holding that invoking strict scrutiny is inappropriate in a class action involving poor families). 82 See, e.g. , Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297, 322- 25 (1980); Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. 464, 470- 72 (1977); San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 18- 37 (1973); Lindsey v.

The author continues, \"The generosity of the welfare state is the dominant cause of how much poverty exist s in affluent Western democracies.\" Id. And, of course, the scope and scale of the welfare state is a matter of politics. 84 Id. 402 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 recession, many formerly middle -class people are falling into poverty, and the poverty rate is about to surpass rates not seen since the 1960s.85 The OWS movement argues that poverty is not inevitable; it cannot be blamed solely on personal failings; and it results from structural features of the economy that are reinforced or ignored by government policies. However, in the ideology of the Supreme Court, government is not responsible for creating poverty and, thus, bears no obligation to solve it.86 1. The Constitution Does Not Create Social and Economic Rights The core principle of the Court 's class doctrine is that the Constitution does not ensure any minimum level of entitlement or standard of living. No one is constitutionally entitled to food, housing, medical care, or education.87 As the Court has stated, \" the Due Process Clauses generally confer no affirmative right to governmental aid, even where such aid may be necessary to secure life, lib erty, or property interests of which the government itself may not deprive the individual. \"88 In this view, the Constitution creates negative, rather than positive, rights, meaning that the Constitution protects against government interference of rights, but it does not create any affirmative obligations on the part of government.89 Consistent with these principles, the Court ruled in DeShaney v. Winnebego County Department of Social Services90 that the Constitution is not implicated when the state Department of Social Services turns a child over to an abusive father after repeated warnings of abuse, and the child is injured as a result.91 Nor is the Constitution violated, according to Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales ,92 when a police department fails to enforce a domestic violence protective order, thus leading to the murder of a woman' s three children by her 85 See, e.g. , Hope Yen, 4 in 5 in USA Face Near -Poverty, No Work , USA TODAY , Sept. 17, 2013, http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/07/28/americans -pov erty-no-work/2594203/ (reporting on an Associated Press survey data that \"[t]he risks of poverty . . . have been increasing in recent decades . . . coinciding with widening income inequality.\"). , Harris v.

This narrative of the negative Constitution is widely accepted, but it is neither natural nor inevitable.95 To begin with, the idea that the Constituti on does not create affirmative rights is not textually accurate. There are many provisions of the Constitution that secure affirmative rights, such as the right to a trial by jury or the right to equal protection, which requires the \"federal government to protect its citizens in the face of the states ' failure to do so.\" 96 Moreover, the action versus inaction dichotomy is a false one.97 As the DeShaney and Gonzeles cases show, government can harm as much by inaction as by action, and this distinction \"does not take into account government 's pervasive influence through regulatory action and inaction, its displacement of private remedies, and indeed, its monopoly over some avenues of relief. \"98 While property and contract may look at first blush like private ma rket rights, in reality, the government creates and protects those rights 93 Id. at 768. 94 For a discussion of domestic violence victims, see Deborah M.

Unlike the United States, the constitutions of many other countries guarantee social and economic rights.100 While critics charge that such rights are impossible and inappropriate for the judiciary to enforce,101 there are examples where courts have held such rights justiciable. For instance, in South Africa, the countr y's highest court ruled that the government is obliged to take reasonable measures within its available resources to achieve progressive realization of the right to housing.102 This decision preserved an important role for the judiciary in protecting vulnera ble populations, while respecting the policymaking role of the political branches. Our own history reveals a greater commitment to social and economic rights than prevailing doctrine admits.103 In the 1960s and 1970s, in particular, there was a vibrant welfa re rights movement and a receptive Court that appeared poised to recognize social and economic rights.104 The groundwork was laid in a series of cases in which the Court ruled that indigence would not limit access to judicial or electoral processes, which ar e fundamental aspects of citizenship.105 The Court has also ruled that states cannot limit welfare benefits to new residents without violating a constitutional right to travel, and it reaffirmed this principle postwelfare reform.106 While these right -to-travel cases are a rare win for the poor, it is notable 99 Sunstein, supra note 96, at 6; see also Bandes, supra note 88, at 2239. 100 David Land au, The Reality of Social Rights Enforcement , 53 H ARV.

The highwater mark of constitutional protection for th e poor came in the case of Goldberg v. Kelly ,107 in which the Court held that welfare benefits were a form of property entitled to due process protections.108 Justice Brennan addressed the importance of welfare benefits, stating, \" [w]elfare, by meeting the basic demands of subsistence, can help bring within the reach of the poor the same opportunities that are available to others to participate meaningfully in the life of the community.\"109 Yet, the promise of due process often fails claimants who usually lack lawyers to argue appeals, struggle to get to hearings, and cannot take off work to fight for their benefits. Nevertheless, the Goldberg opinion was vitally important in recognizing that public assistance \"is not mere charity, \" but a means for furthering democratic norms.110 However, the momentum built by these welfare rights cases came to a screeching halt when President Nixon appointed four conservative Justices in 1970.111 2. The Poor are Not a Suspect Class After 1970, the Court solidified its position t hat the poor are not a suspect class under the Equal Protection Clause, and thus , legislation that discriminates on the basis of wealth is reviewed under a lenient rational basis standard. A suspect class is a group of people who have an immutable trait, w ho suffer from a history of prejudice and stereotyping, and who lack a political voice.112 The Court has long recognized that race, national origin, alienage, and gender are suspect classes, and as a result, legislation that draws lines on these bases is assessed under a heightened level of scrutiny.113 By contrast, without ever fully explaining why, the 107 397 U.S. 254 (1970). 108 Id. at 262. 109 Id. at 265. 110 Id. 111 See Sunstein, supra note 96, at 20 -22. \"[I]t does not seem to me too speculative to suggest that if Humphrey had been elected, social and economic rights, American -style would have become a part of American constitution al understandings.\" Id. at 22. 112 This framework was set forth in the famous footnote 4 of U.S. v.

Jeter, 486 U.S. 456, 461 (1988). 406 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 Court has regularly assumed that the poor do not meet the test for a suspect class,114 and it hammered home that point in its abortion funding cases.115 In Harris v. McRae ,116 the Court upheld Congress 's denial of Medicaid coverage for medically necessary abortions; the restriction was challenged as violating equal protection because Medicaid covered other medically necessary procedures.117 The Court stated, \" this Cour t has never held that financial need alone identifies a suspect class for purposes of equal protection analysis, \"118 explaining that \" although government may not place obstacles in the path of a woman 's exercise of her freedom of choice, it need not remove t hose not of its own creation. Indigency falls in the latter category.\"119 In the Court 's view, an indigent woman has the same range of options as if Congress had chosen not to provide health care coverage at all.120 In dissent, Justice Brennan remarked that th e government 's antiabortion policy may have resulted from majoritarian processes, but it was not foisted on rich and poor alike. Rather, \" it imposes that viewpoint only upon that segment of our society which, because of its position of political powerlessn ess, is least able to defend its privacy rights from the encroachments of state-mandated morality.\"121 The majority's assertion that government plays no role in creating indigency is simply wrong, especially in light of the state's role in tolerating gender discrimination in the labor market, which depresses women's wages.122 The irony of the decision is the Court's \" failure to see that the inaccessibility of free abortions, combined with a legal system which does not require employers to grant maternity leaves, child -care leaves, or a flexible work schedule, creates the very indigency which prevents women from exercising the choice to have an 114 Julie Nice argues that this is still an open question, as the Supreme Court has never explained why the poor are not a suspect class.

For instance, while poverty is certainly not immutable, intergenerational mobility is far more limited than our meritocratic myth assumes, as well as lower than in other countries. \" Four out of 10 children whose family is in the bottom fifth [incomes up to about $25,000] will end up there as adults.

For these reasons, immutability seems a weak peg on which to hang constitutional doctrine. As to the second factor, the poor suffer from a history of prejudice and stereotyping that is compounded by racial and gender biases. As poverty scholars have explained, the poor have historically been categorized as either deserving, meaning they cannot be blamed for their poverty, such as children, widows, and the disabled, or undeserving, meaning they should be self -sufficient, such as able - bodied adults.128 Public support is more generous for the former , stingy and stigmatizing for the latter. This demarcation was put in stark relie f when welfare was reformed in 1996 from an open- ended entitlement program based on means- tested criteria. The theoretical foundation of the current welfare program, called Temporary Assistance to Needy Families ( \"TANF \"), is that individual choices cause p overty, in particular, the individual choices of African American residents of inner -city neighborhoods marked by concentrated poverty. Although African - Americans only account for one -quarter of the poverty population,129 and although few welfare recipients have lifelong dependency on welfare, the dialogue and debate surrounding welfare reform centered on a culture of pathology among inner -city African Americans.130 The media and politicians picked up on these cultural expla nations for poverty, and began demonizing the welfare queen, a term popularized by President Reagan, which referred to a \" woman of color who manipulates and exploits the welfare system, scorns lasting or legalized relationships with men, and has a series o f children out of wedlock in order to Income Inequality Associated with Lower Intergenerational Mobility?, FREAKONOMICS : THE HIDDEN SIDE OF EVERYTHING (Jan. 19, how closely related inequality and [intergenerational] mobility are.\"). 128 See generally MICHAEL B.

TANF has pushed millions off of welfare, but the vast majority of former welfare recipients remain poor, either because they are working in low -wage jobs or have disengaged from the social welfare system entirely.134 As the TANF history reveals, the poor lack a meaningful political voice, which goes to the third step of the suspect class test. A study by Martin Gilens showed a statistical correlation between the views of higher income Americans and policy outcomes.135 While legislation reflects the preferences of higher income Americans, the preferences of the poor are completely ignored, and even the preferences of median Americans have no impact when their preferences diverge from the wealthy. 136 Why do the wealthy fare better?

Williams ,147 in which the Court upheld Maryland 's family cap welfare policy.148 That is, a policy of capping welfare benefits regardless of the size of a family, thereby not meeting the state 's self-defined \"standard of need \" for larger families.149 The Court stated that, \" [i]n the area of economics and social welfare, a State does not violate the Equal Protection Clause merely because the classifications made by its laws are imperfect. \"150 The Court acknowledged the difference between regulations affecting business and industry and those that involve \"the most basic economic needs of impoverished human beings.\"151 Yet, it could \"find no basis for applying a different constitutional standard.\"152 In short, \"the intractable economic, social, and even philoso phical problems presented by public welfare assistance programs are not the business of this Court. \"153 This theme was echoed in San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez ,154 discussed below, where the Court stated, with regard to school financing, that \"the ultimate solutions must come from the lawmakers and from the democratic pressures of those who elect them. \" 155 This deference, however, is selectively applied, as the Court has not deferred to other laws that serve the 99% , such as laws creating vo luntary desegregation plans, laws regulating campaign finance, and laws regulating consumer welfare.

The Roberts Court In 2008 Jeffrey Rosen wrote in The New York Times Magazine that the Robert s Court was \" exceptionally good for American business.\"156 Dean Erwin Chemerinsky similarly concluded that \"the Roberts Court \" is the most probusiness Supreme Court since the mid- 1930s.\"157 Progressive interest groups, liberal politicians, and the media picked up this theme, spurring academic interest in the alleged probusiness bias of the Roberts Court.158 Studies confirm that business interests have indeed fared well under the Roberts Court.159 From the beginning of the Roberts Court through the 2010 term, the po sition taken by the litigation arm of the Chamber of Commerce, which both represents and files amicus briefs in favor of business interests, \" prevailed in 65% of cases before the Roberts Court. \"160 In the 2011 term, the Chamber had a near -perfect record.161 Moreover, the Roberts Court is more likely than its predecessors to grant certiorari to cases involving 156 See Jeffrey Rosen, Supreme Court, Inc ., N.Y.

Indeed, history shows a steady uptick in probusiness outcomes from 28% before the Warren Court to 48% before the Burger Court to 54% before the Rehnquist Court.167 Notably, the Rehnquist Court began hearing cases in 1987, paralleling the escalation in income inequality. Professor J. Mitchell Pickerill explains that the acceleration in pr obusiness outcomes under the Rehnquist Court resulted from the solidification of the New Right Regime under President Reagan, who was committed to an economic agenda that centered on deregulation, tax relief, and supply- side economics and who appointed jur ists to the bench who shared his ideology.168 He concludes that the Roberts Court's \" pro-business decisions are best understood as the culmination of a long issue evolution during the New Right Regime.\"169 President Clinton sought 162 Jonathan H.

Overall, the Roberts Court has consolidated a probusiness tilt that began in the Reagan era. 2. Under the Surface Of course, counting outcomes and votes does not tell the whole story. As Professor Martha McCluskey has pointed out, in order to understand how class assumptions shape the law , \"we must look under the surface . . . to examine the way in which unequal class privileges and penalties become folded into the background as natural and necessary to the public order . . . .\"171 Demonstrating this approach, she unpacks the 2003 c ase of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Campbell .172 In that case, the Supreme Court reversed a Utah Supreme Court decision upholding a punitive damage award of $145 million against State Farm.173 The Utah Supreme Court found that State Farm had \" repeatedly and deliberately deceived and cheated its customers\" through a national scheme to meet corporate fiscal goals by capping payouts on claims and that its \" fraudulent practices were consistently directed to persons\u2014poor racial or ethnic minorities, women, and elderly individuals \u2014who State Farm believed would be less likely to object or take legal action. \"174 Despite these findings, the Supreme Court held that the punitive damage award violated the corporation's due process interests.175 McCluskey takes on each of the Court 's rationales. First, the Court was concerned that giving juries too much discretion might lead them to award punitive damages based on arbitrary whims. 176 Yet, as McCluskey argues, the Court has conversely upheld the norm of discretion for jurors considering the death penalty in ways that result in racial discrimination and for police in enforcing mandatory court orders of protection in domestic violence cases \u2014in both situat ions, such discretion can and has led to a loss of life or liberty. 177 Second, the Court contended that corporations must have fair notice about the severity of penalties for wrongdoing so that they can shape their behavior accordingly.178 McCluskey counters t hat corporations are well positioned to take rational steps to prevent and mitigate the potential of any large punitive damages awards, especially insurance 170 Id. at 1064, 1088- 90. 171 Martha T.

Whereas the State Farm decision refused to allow evidence of systemic wrongdoing in an individual case, the Court in Wal -Mart Stores Inc. v. Dukes183 shut the door to systemic evidence even in a class action, ruling that a proposed class of over one million female Wal -Mart employees could not prove common claims necessary for class certification.184 In Wal-Mart , women employees alleged that the company 's discretionary pay and promotion policies had a discriminatory impact on female employees, pointing to statistics showing that women filled 70% of the hourly jobs in Wal -Mart stores, but constituted only 33% of management positions, and across the company, women were paid less than men.185 In his majority opinion, Justice Scalia asserted that Wal -Mart's policy of granting discretion to supervisors over employment decisions was \" a very common and presumptively reasonable way of doing business. \"186 He assumed th at \"left to their own devices most managers in any corporation . . . would select sex- neutral, performance -based criteria for hiring and promotion that produce no actionable disparity at all. \"187 In this view, any disparity must arise from benign factors, such as women 's lack of qualifications. For Justice Scalia, \"it is quite unbelievable that all managers would exercise their discretion in a common way without some common direction. \"188 By contrast, this outcome was quite believable for Justice Ginsberg, who authored the dissent. As she explained, discriminatory, discretionary employment practices can result from unconscious biases as well as a corporate culture that reinforces gender stereotypes through meetings, managerial 179 McCluskey, supra note 171, at 1047 -48. 180 State Farm Mut.

Class- based claims also failed in AT&T Mobility v. Concepcion,191 in which consumers sued a cell phone company for fraud and false advertising after they were charged over $30 in sales tax under a contract offerin g a free phone.192 In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court held that the plaintiffs could not proceed by class action in court because their contract required arbitration and , further, that the Federal Arbitration Act bars class actions in arbitration as well.193 In so doing, the Court overturned California law that made it unconscionable for adhesion contracts to bar class- wide actions. 194 Writing for the majority, Justice Scalia's sympathies were entirely with corporate defendants, who might face pressure to sett le questionable claims due to the \"'in terrorem' settlements that class actions entail. \"195 By contrast, Justice Breyer was less concerned with the \" terror \" facing corporations than the rights lost by consumers. He argued that agreements forbidding class act ions \"can lead small -dollar claimants to abandon their claims rather than to litigate. \"196 Indeed, \"[w]hat rational lawyer would have signed on to represent the Concepcions in litigation for the possibility of fees stemming from a $30.22 claim? \" 197 Given this dilemma, California law sought to protect consumers from adhesion contracts that insulate corporations from liability for their own frauds by \" deliberately cheat[ing] large numbers of consumers out of individually small sums of money. \"198 However, the decisi on gives corporations the power to determine what protections to grant consumers, and the result may be a lack of any incentives for corporations to comply with consumer laws in the first place. 199 This case is part of a larger effort by the Supreme Court to interpret the Federal Arbitration Act beyond its legislative intent and history to \"render unenforceable legal guarantees such as workplace discrimination protections\u2014 or protections of any sort for individuals obliged to sign nonnegotiable contracts impos ed by 189 Id. at 2563 -64 (Ginsburg, J. dissenting). 190 Id. at 2555 (majority opinion), 2563- 64 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). 191 131 S.

Unions In contrast to the rise of corporate influence over politics, the economy, and the courts, the influence of unions has waned. In fact, the decline of organized labor is a major factor \u2014at least one-fifth to one-third \u2014in growing wage inequality, making it as significant as the stratification of pay by education. 210 Private sector union membership has plunged from almost 25% of all workers in the 1970s to today's 7%, while wage inequality shot up over 40% over this same time period.211 The decline of unions impacts not only unionized workers, but also other workers, because unions have traditionally been the major interest grou p advocating on economic issues for the middle and lower classes, such as executive pay controls, pay equity, a higher minimum wage, and support for social welfare programs. 212 By contrast, advanced industrial nations with strong unions have seen less econom ic inequality.213 The decline of American unions starting in the 1970s is traceable to several factors, including the growth of jobs in fields outside \"traditional union strongholds; \" 214 intensified employer opposition;215 congres s- ional defeats of prounion reforms spurred by increased corporate donations to Congress;216 the appointment of Republican appointees to the National Labor Relations Board, which in turn issued decisions that limited union organizing;217 and the defeat of the 1981 air controllers strike by P resident Reagan.218 These trends reinforce a norm of free competition rather than fair competition.219 The 210 Bruce Western & Jake Rosenfeld, Unions, Norms, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality , 76 A M.

For instance, in 2012, the Court issued Knox v. Service Employees International Union, Local 1000,221 ruling against a union that charged non - members a special fee to support political activity.222 Under California law, public sector employees can create an \" agency shop \" by deciding through majority vote to be represented by a union.223 In order to prevent free riding, nonmembers have to pay an annual fee for collective bargaining representation provided by the union, but due to First Amendment constraints, they can opt out of supporting the union's political activities.224 In the summer of 2005, the Service Employees International Union (\"SEIU \") was fighting several anti -union ballot initiatives , and it deci ded to issue a special assessment to generate additional union fees.225 Several non - members objected to having to support the SEIU's political activities.226 Writing for a five -member maj ority, Justice Alito held the union should have required an opt -in for nonmembers, rather than relying on an opt -out procedure and that this failure violated the nonmembers' First Amendment right against compelled support of private speech and created a \" remarkable boon for unions.\" 227 The majority 's approach purposefully limits unions ' ability to raise money for political activity. In concurrence, Justice Sotomayor agreed that the nonmembers had the constitutional right not to financially support political s peech, as this was settled law, but disagreed that the Constitution required an opt -in procedure for special assessments\u2014an issue which the litigants did not request, argue, or brief. 228 In her words, the majority's opinion went far beyond the question prese nted and, thus, \"breaks our own rules and, more importantly, disregards principles of judicial restraint that define the Court's proper role in our 220 Cf.

The outcome in Knox stands in stark contrast with Citizens United v. F EC,232 discussed below, in which the Court held that corporate entities can spend their funds on political campaigns without concern for shareholder preferences.233 To be sure, Citizens United also permits unions to spend money on political campaigns, yet there is an asymmetry between the ability of corporations and unions to fund this activity. Corporations can spend their treasury funds without shareholder approval, while unions must get the consent of their members.234 C.

Board of Education,247 the Court struck down \" separate but equal \" schools and committed the nation to equal educational opportunity for all children. 248 For over a decade afterward, s outhern states aggressively resisted complying with Brown 's mandate,249 thus prompting the Court to issue several decisions in the mid -1960s striking down a variety of obstructionist tactics.250 In 1971 the Court told the lower federal courts that they had the power to desegregate schools, including using busing as a remedy.251 In subsequent years, desegreg ation made a difference; up until the late 1980s, the percentage of students attending integrated schools continually increased, and by 1988 nearly half of all black students in the South attended majority white schools.252 To date, desegregation remains a p roven method for improving the outcomes for poor, minority children, without harming the achievement of white students.253 However, beginning in the 1970s, the Court put the brakes on desegregation. In Keyes v.

Rachel Moran critiques the decision, stating that \"a majority of the Justices were so concerned with limiting remedies for past discrimination that they largely overlooked the problem of constraining a community 's capacity to imagine its racial future.\" Moran, supra note 258, at 477. 426 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 discrimination does not jus tify race -conscious government action. \"269 By contrast, the dissenting Justices, led by Justice Breyer, concluded that the voluntary desegregation plans satisfied compelling state interests in diversity and avoiding racial isolation and were narrowly tailore d to achieve that interest.270 In his controlling opinion, Justice Kennedy agreed with the dissent that the government has a compelling state interest \"in ensuring all people have equal opportunity regardless of their race.\"271 However, he joined with the plurality in concluding that the plans at issue were not narrowly tailored to survive strict scrutiny because they classified students on the basis of race.272 Instead of racial classifications, Justice Kennedy suggested that sch ool districts promoting diversity can survive by using race- neutral mechanisms, such as site selection of new schools, redrawn attendance zones, or even individualized evaluations that might include race as a factor, in accordance with the Grutter case, wh ich permits the use of race along with other factors in law school admissions.273 Importantly, the breakdown of votes reflects underlying assumptions about the causes of residential and educational segregation. In his plurality opinion, Justice Roberts stat ed, \"The distinction between segregation by state action and racial imbalance caused by other factors has been central to our jurisprudence in this area for generations. \"274 In other words, for Justice Roberts, housing and school segregation result from \" other factors\" (i.e., private, natural, market forces outside the scope of government responsibility ). By contrast, Justice Breyer explicated a long history of purposeful, governmental discrimination in the educational systems of Seattle and Louisville, as w ell as governmental policies that created residential segregation.275 He then linked both these patterns to the current barriers facing cities that want to provide diverse educational opportunities for their students. As he put it, \" [t]he historical and fact ual context in which these cases arise is critical. \" 276 In light of this history, Justice Breyer claimed that the cities had an interest \" in continuing to combat the remnants of segregation caused in whole or in part by these school -related policies, which have often affected not only schools, but also housing patterns, employment practices, economic conditions, and social attitudes. \" 277 In Justice Breyer's view, government played a role in creating segregation, and thus, it should play a role in dismantling it. For his part, Justice Kennedy similarly acknowledged that \" [d]ue to a variety of factors\u2014some influenced by government, some not \u2014neighborhoods in our communities do not reflect the diversity of our Nation as a whole. \"278 In 269 Parents Involved , 551 U.S. at 731. 270 Id. at 803 (Breyer, J., dissenting). 271 Id. at 788 (Kennedy, J., concurring). 272 Id. at 787. 273 Id. at 789 -90. 274 Id. at 736 (majority opinion). 275 Id. at 804 -19 (Breyer, J., dissenting). 276 Id. at 804. 277 Id. at 838. 278 Id. at 798 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). 2014] A COURT FOR THE ONE PERCENT 427 short, Justices who draw a stark line between de jure and de facto segregation without seeing the possible linkages between them do not support remedial efforts to desegregate schools. The majority's refusal to acknowledge this connection appears either clueless or willfully blind to th e government's role in creating segregated housing patterns, which in turn, impacts school enrollment.279 Professors Douglas Massey and Nancy Denton have explained in detail how federal governmental policies served to isolate and segregate urban, African -Ame rican communities from the rest of the urban and regional environment. 280 In brief, the history is as follows. During the 1930s and '40s, African -Americans were trapped as renters within inner cities when the federal government and private banks redlined minority neighborhoods and refused to provide African -Americans with mortgages, thus reducing a source of household wealth for generations.281 Meanwhile, the white middle class left the inner cities for suburban homes subsidized by federally underwritten mor tgages and on highways built with federal funds.282 Further, the location of the highways 279 \"Just as students of society know that race still matters, students of American history understand that ghetto and barrio schools are not natural, but manmade. They grew from a tangled mix of forces. This includes the blatant racial discrimination in housing and seemingly 'race -neutral' zoning, and mortgage lending and real estate practices that over many decades corralled people of color and the poor into what are now overburdened communities and schools.\" Charles J.

Currently , eighty school districts, educating over four million children, use some form of socioeconomic school integration. 293 Supporters assert that socioec onomic integ - ration raises achievement of low -income students, without any negative impacts on other students.294 Others are more skeptical about the benefits of the socioeconomic approach, noting that it does not lead to significant racial mixing or overcome the racial achievement gap. 295 \"Class -based solutions do not consider the fact that white resistance to being in predominantly black neighborhoods is independent of class and that the highest -income black families are as segregated from white counterparts as the lowest -income.\"296 Thus, class- based solutions may not be able to overcome the racial dimension of income inequality. In sum, it remains to be seen whether class- based integration can reduce educational inequality. 2.

Rodriguez ,301 the Supreme Court rejected their claim, holding that unequal finan- cing schemes did not violate the Constitution. The Court concluded that strict scrutiny of the law was not trig gered because the poor did not constitute a suspect class302 and because education is not a fundamental right.303 While acknowledging that education is important to the effective exercise of First Amendment freedoms and the right to vote, the Court asserted that education is not guaranteed by the text of the Constitution.304 Moreover, the Court ruled that the school -financing scheme was a form of economic and social legislation subject to rational basis review, which in turn demands deference to legislative choic es.305 As the Court stated, \" the ultimate solutions must come from the lawmakers and from the democratic pressures of those who elect them. \" 306 This paean to deference is missing in the most recent desegregation cases. 298 Wilson, supra note 240, at 628 (explaining how the \"Supreme Court [] has arguably contributed to the inter -district disparities by legitimizing the primacy of localism in its school equity jurisprudence\") (emphasis omitted). 299 Robinson, supra note 236, at 434; see Lisa R.

The Court majority in Rodriguez viewed the financing disparities as resulting from inevitable residential patterns created by \"the growth of commercial and industrial centers and accompanying shifts in population.\"307 As the Court viewed these housing patterns, the Justices concluded, \"[i]t is equally inevitable that some localities are going to be blessed with more tax able assets than others. \"308 The majority commented that wealth is not \"a static quantity, \" and it can change \" from any number of events, some of which local residents can and do influence,\" as well as from public and private incentives for businesses to loc ate within certain districts.309 In this view, the state has no responsibility to correct for segregated housing patterns because these patterns result primarily from market forces. By contrast, in dissent, Justice Marshall went further in identifying government as a cause for educational inequality, emphasizing \" the extent to which . . . the State is responsible for the wealth discrimination in this instance.\"310 As he explained, the state not only created local school districts and tied s chool funding to the local property tax, it also \" imposed land use controls [that] have undoubtedly encouraged and rigidified natural trends in the allocation of particular areas for residential or commercial use, and thus determined each district' s amount of taxable property wealth. \"311 For Justice Marshall, the extent of state involvement warranted close scrutiny of the state 's financing decisions; for the majority, the financing patterns reflected preordained, mostly private choices. As a result of Rodriguez , there are no federal constitutional constraints on unequal education spending, and not surprisingly, vast disparities remain within and between states. Even federal funding under Title I, the education law designed to support low -income schools, creates and permits disparities.312 On average, schools with high levels of poor students spend $825 fewer per pupil than higher income schools, creating an average shortfall of over $500,000 in a typical low - income elementary school.313 In light of these dis parities and the Supreme Court 's abandonment of poor students, advocates have challenged unequal school financing in state courts, relying on state constitutional provisions that provide a right to education. 314 The results have been mixed.315 Even where lawsu its have 307 Rodriguez , 411 U.S. at 48. 308 Id. at 54. 309 Id. 310 Id. at 123 (Marshall, J., dissenting). 311 Id. at 123 -24. 312 See Derek W.

Affirmative Action and Higher Education A college degree is increasingly associated with higher lifetime earnings,320 as well as better health, longer life expectancy, and increased civic involvement.321 However, there is an income gap impacting college access and graduation rates.322 Whereas 80% of high school graduates from the upper quintile of the income distribution attend college, only 44% do so from the bottom quintile.323 In top tier colleges, 74% of the students come from the top quartile, while 3% come from the bottom quartile.324 This atten dance and graduation gap is driven by several factors that plague low -income schools, including lower -quality preparation in K -12 education, less ability by students to afford college, decreasing financial assistance for low -income students, and a lack of understanding of the college application 316 See Robinson , supra note 236, at 436 (reviewing R YAN, supra note 236) (\"Instead, resulting school finance reforms typically focus on modest increases in funding levels for low-wealth districts while simultaneously maintaining existing funding levels or raising more slowly the funding rate for wealthier districts. This approach preserves the fiscal autonomy of wealthier, typically suburban school districts.\") (citations omitted). 317 See Ryan, supra note 297, at 255. 318 David Karen & Kevin J.

The Court decided that the Act 's \"ultimate focus is on the quality of educational programming and services provided to students, not the amount of money spent on them.\" Id. at 466 -67.

Initially, affirmative action was design ed to equalize access to higher education in light of our history, in which colleges enrolled few minorities due to overt segregation and discriminatory admissions policies.327 Currently, the Court approves affirmative action for a separate rationale of ensu ring diversity, which the Court recognizes as a compelling state interest. 328 In 2013 the Court held in Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin329 that the means a university uses to achieve racial diversity must be narrowly tailored and are subject to strict scrutiny.330 It remains unclear whether and how universities will be able to meet this stringent standard. Accordingly, like desegregation at the K -12 level, this may be another area where class- based affirmative action will become increasingly attractive to colleges looking to maintain diverse student bodies. Here , too, the lack of constitutional protection for class may prove beneficial for low -income and minority students, as any college wishing to diversify socioeconomically would be subject to a lenient rational basis review standard. However, the efficacy of cl ass- based affirmative action is unclear. On the one hand, some charge that emphasis on class may reduce racial diversity, given that poor whites not only outnumber blacks, but also tend to have higher scores.331 In other words, even within social classes, resources and opportunities are distributed unequally and on a racialized basis. 332 On the other hand, it appears that some carefully constructed class -based plans can boost both socioeconomic and racial diversity.333 At the same time, 325 Id. at 127, 135 -37. 326 Id. at 128. 327 See Angelo N.

D. Politics and Power Shortly before the 2012 presidential election, over 80% of Americans stated that there is too much corporate money in politics.334 Americans understand the power wielded by money in politics but may not fully comprehend how the Supreme Court supports this financial scaffolding. If the political system contributes to economic inequality, then it is important to understand how law impacts politics. As this Part explains, the Supreme Court has directed political outcomes, dismantled congressional attempts to rein in corporate political spending, and undermined the electoral proce ss for low -income voters. In each of these areas, the 1% flourishes , while the 99% becomes increasingly disenfranchised. 1. Supreme Court Influence over Politics A main tenet of the OWS movement is that income and wealth inequality are not driven solely by economics, but also by politics. Political scientists have analyzed how political decisions reinforce and create economic inequality, both through affirmative legislation, as well as through drift, or failure to respond to changing circumstances. 335 As noted above, studies show that at the federal level, senators ignore the policy preferences of people at the low end of the income ladder , are minimally attuned to the middle , and are highly responsive to high- income voters.336 Further, there are partisan di fferences within these trends; pol - itical scientist Larry Bartels has shown that Republican senators are about twice as responsive to high- income voters as compared to Democratic senators.337 Moreover, Bartels found that over the last fifty years, the incom es of middle - class families grew twice as fast under Democratic Administrations than they did under Republican administrations, while the incomes of the working poor grew six times as fast under Democrats.338 This pattern results from partisan differences in RACIAL PREFERENCES (2012), available at http://tcf.org/assets/downloads/tcf -abaa.pdf; Matthew N.

Bu sh presided over a 2% cumulative increase in the real incomes of families at the 95th percentile of the income distribution,\" while there was a simultaneous 1% drop in the real incomes for the middle class and a 3% drop for the working poor.341 By contrast, if Vice President Gore had governed over this time period, the real incomes of the working poor would likely have grown 6%, the real incomes of the middle class would have grown by 4.5%, and the real incomes of the top 5% would have remained unchanged. 342 Of course, President George W. Bush can thank the Supreme Court for his presidency. In Bush v. Gore ,343 the Supreme Court decided the outcome of the November 2000 Presidential election.344 Preceding the decision, Vice President Gore had a popular vote advantage of over a half million votes and a slight advantage in electoral college votes (267 versus President Bush's 246).345 The election came down to Florida and its twenty -five electoral vot es.346 Out of almost six million votes cast in Florida, and after a statutorily required machine recount in the event of close elections, Governor George W. Bush led Gore by 327 votes.347 Gore relied on Florida's election law to challenge the results, and the Florida Supreme Court ordered a recount of all ballots that either indicated no presidential preference or more than one.348 The dispute culminated in the Bush v. Gore349 decision, in which the Court stopped the recount.350 In its per curiam decision, the major ity held that the use of manual recounts violated the Equal Protection Clause because there were no uniform standards governing how to discern voter intent on ambiguous ballots, and moreover, that it was too late to implement proper procedures.351 However, a s Justice Stevens stated 339 Id. at 3, 34- 42. 340 Id. at 3.

Business Influence over Politics Businesses influence politics in many ways\u2014from donating to political campaigns to running ads supporting or denouncing politicians to lobbying politicians once they are in office. There are almost no restraints on the extent or form of corporat e influence over politics, and this is a factor in maintaining economic inequality. Still, the Court has struck down Congress 's own attempts to limit its exposure to corporate influence. As Professors Nolan McCarty, Keith Poole, and Howard Rosenthal have demonstrated, both political polarization and economic inequality have swelled since 1975, and they are linked because polarization creates gridlock, thus making it difficult to redress inequality. 356 Republican electoral success has driven extreme polarizat ion,357 resulting in a decline in the real value of the minimum wage, a drop in the estate tax rate, and lower federal income tax rates at the top of the income scale.358 In other words, people at the top of the income scale are obtaining economically benefici al policies; those at the bottom are not. Escalating campaign expenditures feed polarization, as a small group of extremely wealthy contributors can focus their funds on politicians who support their ideology.359 Because Democrats are just as dependent as Republicans on campaign funds, they have similarly failed to take on economic inequality as an issue and have become increasingly probusiness.360 Moreover, in today' s polarized climate, taking extreme political positions makes fundraising easier,361 and funds ar e desperately needed to meet the expenses of media and advertising that drive modern campaigns.362 Despite congressional efforts to rein in campaign financing, the Supreme Court has reinforced the primacy of corporate money in politics, most recently in Citi zens United v.

Valeo365 that Congress could mandate disclosur es and limit individual political contributions, as they do not constitute speech or raise the risk of quid pro quo contributions to candidates. 366 However, the restrictions on political expenditures, or money spent on communications to voters, were invalid because such restrictions \"limit political expression at the core of our electoral process and of the First Amendment freedoms.\"367 After Buckley, the Court waffled in its deference to congressionally enacted campaign spending limits.368 In 1990, in Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce,369 the Court upheld electoral spending limits on corporations in order to limit the \" corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have litt le or no correlation to the public 's support for the corporation' s political ideas. \"370 Nevertheless, by the 1990s, soft money, or money spent by political parties for party building, began pouring into the political process through issue ads, which avoided FECA regulations of express advocacy.371 Entities such as PACs, 527s, and other nonprofit groups also funded issue ads, which avoided forbidden \"magic words \" that urge viewers to vote for or against a particular candidate, but are still designed to shape electoral outcomes.372 Congress passed the McCain -Feingold Act in 2002 to close this soft money loophole in campaign finance law.373 Among other things, the Act prohibited corporations and unions from running electioneering broadcast ads thirty days before primar ies and sixty days before general elections.374 364 James A.

Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc .,377 in which the Court took a narrow view of express advocacy and ruled that government could only restrict corporate spending on advertising that was \" susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate. \"378 In Citizens United ,379 the Court went even further, striking down all campaign finance prohibitions on corporate expenditures \u2014whether for express or issue advocacy.380 Such prohibitions were found to be unconstitutional because \" the First Amendment generally prohibits the suppres sion of political speech based on the speaker 's identity. \"381 Citizens United resulted from an anti -Hillary Clinton documentary shown on cable television via video- on-demand before the presidential primaries of 2008 in violation of McCain- Feingold electionee ring restrictions.382 According to the Court, it would be unfair to permit individuals and unincorporated associations free rein to spend on independent expenditures, while \"certain disfavored associations of citizens\u2014 those that have taken on the corporate form\u2014are penalized for engaging in the same political speech. \"383 Based on Citizens United , federal courts and the FEC have subsequently opened the door to unlimited contributions by individuals or groups to super PACs,384 which were previously limited to $5,000 donations.385 Critics of the decision, and there are many,386 have remarked on the Court 's overly solicitous stance toward corporations given that \"a corporation is an economic entity, not a citizen; a profit - making enterprise, not an enlightened intelligenc e; a creature of the law, not a 375 540 U.S. 93 (2003). 376 Id. at 206 -07. 377 551 U.S. 449 (2007). 378 Id. at 451. 379 558 U.S. 310 (2010). 380 Id. at 365. 381 Id. at 350. 382 Id. at 319 -20. 383 Id. at 356. 384 A super PAC is technically known as an independent -expenditure -only committee; these groups may not donate money directly to political candidates, but they can raise unlimited sums to advocate for or against political candidates.

In its opinion, the Court narrowed its conception of corruption to quid pro quo campaign donations and rejected Austin 's endorsement of the antidistortion interest.389 In other words, \" [a]ny concern for political equality \u2014for limiting the ability of the wealthy to deploy their financial advantage in the political arena \u2014 has been ruled out.\"390 Yet, as Lawrence Lessig points out, corruption arises from more than bribes.391 Although such unsavory incidents do occasionally occur, a far more pervasive corrupting influence comes from the normalization of dependency, that is, \" a corruption practiced by decent people \" that leads politicians to focus their efforts on initiatives favor ed by their financial supporters, simultaneously souring citizens on democracy.392 Justice Stevens put it succinctly in dissent : \"[c]orruption operates along a spectrum.\"393 Yet, after Citizens United , individuals, corporations and other groups do not have to limit themselves to issue advertising but can engage in express advocacy to elect or defeat certain candidates.

Justice Stevens summed up the irony of the decision : \"[w]hile American democracy is imperfect, few outside the majority of this Court would have thought its flaws included a dearth of corporate money in politics.\"400 3. Declining Political Participation by the Poor While money is playing an increasing role in influencing the legislative agenda, the poor are participating in politics in lower numbers than other Americans and at decreasing rates. There are many reasons behind this trend: the poor have less ac cess to skills and resources that facilitate participation; they have weaker ties to civic organizations and to trade unions that mobilize participation; and they are not targeted by interest groups.401 In addition, the poor face instit - utional barriers that can limit their participation, such as felon disenfranchisement laws, citizen -initiated voter registration systems, and workday voting schedules.402 Furthermore, the poor become discouraged about the efficacy of political participation when th ey observe social welfare cutbacks and personally interact with government bureaucracies, where they often face demeaning and skeptical treatment. 403 Part of the decline is also linked to increasing residential segregation; the least political participation exists among low -income Americans who live in low-income counties.404 \"The result is that, as the most affluent become more segregated from other parts of American society, the social ecologies that CONGRESS WATCH DIVISION , OUTSIDE MONEY TAKES THE INSIDE TRACK 3 (Taylor Lincoln ed., 2012), available at http://www.citizen.org/documents/outsid e- spending- dominates -2012- election -report.pdf.

In Crawford v. Marion County ,406 the Court upheld an Indiana election law that required citizens voting in person to present government -issued photo identification.407 The challengers alleged that the new law substantially burdened their right to vote in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and, further, that the law was unnecessary to combat voter fraud.408 Indeed, even the majority conceded that the record contains no evidence of any voter fraud actually occurring in Indiana at any time in its history.409 Nevertheless, the Court held that the State's interest in orderly administration outweighed any burden to voters in obtaining identification.410 In dissent, Justice Souter highlighted the burdens on poor, old, and disabled voters to travel to the bureau of motor vehicles, especially given the limited public transportation in Indiana and paucity of license branches.411 In addition, the required documentation for a voter identification card, such as a birth certificate or United States passport, could be costly for \" the poor, the old, and the immobile. \"412 Justice Souter also pointed out the restricted nature of Indiana's law when it comes to provisional ballots, which are ballots filled out by voters who arrive at the polls lacking proper identification.413 In Indiana, anyone who fills out a provisiona l ballot and wants their vote counted must go to a circuit court or election board within ten days of the election to sign an affidavit \u2014another potentially costly trip \"uncomfortably close to the outright $1.50 fee we struck down 42 years ago\" in Harper , outlawing the poll tax.414 405 Id. at 123. 406 553 U.S. 181 (2008). 407 Id. at 204. 408 Id. at 187. 409 Id. at 194. 410 Id. at 196. 411 Id. at 211 -16 (Souter, J., dissenting). 412 Id. at 216 (2008). 413 Id. at 216 -18. 414 Id. at 237 (citing Harper v.

Holder ,415 in which it struck down Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act by a 5 -4 vote.416 Section 4 identified certain jurisdictions with historie s of voting discrimination.417 In turn, Section 5 required those jurisdictions to seek preclearance, or approval, from the Justice Department before making any changes to their voting systems, such as changing polling place locations or hours or altering vot ing district boundaries.418 Thus, Section 5, considered the most effective civil rights statute ever enacted, is now effectively dead.419 Congress had reauthorized the Act as recently as 2006, extending it for twenty -five years.420 Nevertheless, writing for the majority, Justice Roberts contended that changing political conditions over the last fifty years, exemplified by increased minority voter registration and minority elected officials, no longer warranted the Act 's \"extraordinary measures. \" 421 As he stated, \" Coverage today is based on decades- old data and eradicated practices \" that have \" no logical relation to the present day.\"422 Justice Ginsberg , in dissent (for Justices Breyer, Kagan, and Sotomayor) , disagreed, arguing that deference to Congress 's judgment in protecting the right to vote was warranted, especially in light of a voluminous legislative record of recent examples of discrimination in voting, particularly through \" second generation \" tactics designed to dilute the minority vote.423 She warned, \"[t]hrowi ng out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet. \" 424 As she predicted, the impact of Shelby County has been swift.

In light of the role of money in political campaigns and policy- making, one might query whether giving low -income individuals and minorities access to the polls matters. In other words, do Crawford and Shelby County matter? Professor Larry Bartels answers yes, explaining that the views of poor people have an indirect effect because their votes can tip an election toward a Democrat rather than a Republican.426 They may not have a direct influence on politicians once they are elected, but by shaping who enters office, the poor can impact the course of public policy.427 III. EXPLANATIONS AND SOLUTIONS On January 2 0, 2012, around two hundred demonstrators took to the steps of the Supreme Court to protest the Citizens United decision on its second anniversary.428 Nearly a dozen people were arrested after storming through police barricades.429 Asked why she was demonstrating at the Court, one protestor said, \"This is the scene of the crime. \"430 The \"occupiers \" might have been even more numerous and agitated if they knew the extent of the Court 's bias toward corporations, disdain for the poor, and suspicion of equality -promoting legislation. Protests are certainly one way to register dissent. While the Court is unlikely to make decisions based on public pressure, the Justices are clearly aware of public mood. Today, the lasting influence of the Occu py movement is its impact on public opinion. Any future strategies for reform must consider the motivations underlying Court decision- making processes. Accordingly, this Part offers some explanations for Court doctrines that exacerbate economic inequality and makes some suggestions for a long -lasting, progressive legal reform movement. A. Explanations Economic inequality results from a political process that is distorted by corporations and the wealthy due to the influence of money in politics.

The Justices do not campaign for office, and business interests cannot lobby them . They have entirely different incentives than political leaders because they are appointed and have life tenure and , thus, do not have to fill campaign coffers to maintain their jobs. They have nowhere higher to go professionally. Moreover, they are insulated from the hurly -burly of politics because they select the cases they will decide and cannot be reversed on constitutional questions.431 Why , then, is there such a strong strain in Supreme Court jurisprudence in favor of the 1%? There are two major models of Supreme Court decision making that shed light on this question: the a ttitudinal model and the majoritarian model. 1. The Attitudinal Model Under the attitudinal model, Supreme Court Justices vote their policy preferences because they can.432 In other words, Justice Scalia votes the way he does because he is conservative; Justice Breyer votes the way he does because he is liberal.433 Political scientists have generated significant empirical evidence showing that the ideological preferences of the Justices are predictive of their votes in up to three -quarters of cases.434 The att itudinal model reflects the insights of legal realism in rebuking the traditional legal model,435 under which judges neutrally discern the meaning of law through formal tools. Justices themselves claim fealty to the legal model,436 and to be sure, Justices sometimes vote contrary to expectations. Many decisions are unanimous, suggesting that the Justices \" share legal values that can supersede policy preferences. \"437 Even proponents of the attitudinal model recognize that other factors are at work in Supreme Court decision making, such as precedent and modes of interpretation.438 Nevertheless, the attitudinal model is highly predictive and usually prevails when law is indeterminate,439 which is often the case in highly salient issues that come before 431 JEFFREY A.

President Nixon made several conservative appointments to the Court beginning in 1969, halting the liberal gains of the Warren Court, and President Reagan subsequently \" solidified a conservative majority on the Court \" with his appointments.442 Since the rise of economic inequality began in the 1970s, there have been eleven appointments to the Supreme Court. Four were liberals appointed by Democratic presidents ( Justices Ginsberg, Breyer, Sotomayor, Kagan), six were conservatives appointed by Republican presid ents ( Justices O'Connor , Kennedy, Scalia, Thomas, Roberts, Alito), and one was a Republican appointee who turned out to be liberal ( Justice Souter). Conservative Justices have predominated during the bulk of the time period in which economic inequality has increased. This is no accident. Conservative Republicans opposed to big government and dedicated to protecting the wealthy successfully launched a disciplined strategy to get conservative judges appointed throughout the judiciary.443 Currently, there are f our liberal Justices, four conservative Justices, and a swing Justice whose vote is often determinative in close cases (Justice Kennedy). Since 2005, Justice Kennedy has sided twice as often with the conservative wing than the liberal wing in 5 -4 decisions .444 Given this 5 -4 line -up, the attitudinal model may well explain the Court 's conservatism. The four most conservative Justices share a meritocratic conception of American society that is class blind and colorblind. They also view the private market as descriptively and normatively separate from government. Given these underlying ideological commitments, the Court has rejected legislative efforts to regulate market excesses, to restrain the influence of money in campaigns, and to diversify schools, while upholding 440 See SEGAL & SPAETH , supra note 431, at 86, 92 -93; Pickerill, supra note 163, at 1067. 441 See Beth Loy, Exploring a \"Non- Traditional\" Contender in the Battle for Equitable Justice: Introducing Economic Welfare Bias , 11 K AN.

At the same time, the Court upholds private market outcomes , such as corporate cultures and practices that disadvantage employees and consumers. The attitudinal model suggests that the Court's policy preferences will not change unless the composition of the Court changes or individual Justices evolve in their policy preferences. 2. The Public -Opinion Model The second model stresses the majoritarian role of the Court, arguing that the Justices vote in accord with public opinion in order to preserve their legitimacy. 445 This model responds to the countermajoritarian difficulty posed by Professor Alexander Bickel; that is, why courts, which are not accountable politically, should have the fin al say in striking down popularly enacted laws. 446 If courts reflect popular will, this moral problem with judicial review disappears. Professor Barry Friedman is a prominent proponent of the majoritarian view, asserting that \"judicial decisions fall within the range of acceptability, \"447 at least over time.448 Indeed, a comparison of Court votes and public opinion polls confirms an association between the Court 's decisions and public mood. 449 This correlation could result simply from the fact that the Justices are subject to the same cultural stimuli as the rest of the citizenry,450 or alternatively, the Justices may be constrained by public opinion because they want to ensure their decisions are enforced and survive attacks by the other branches.451 Does the majoritarian model mean that the public supports a Supreme Court for the 1%? On the one hand, the public has long overestimated the extent of social mobility in America. One poll showed that 69% of Americans believe that \"[p]eople are rewarded for intelligence and skills; \" even in the heart of the recession, a poll found that 39% believed that it was common for people to start out poor and end up rich.452 In this regard, there are divisions along party lines. 445 Barry Friedman, Mediated Popular Constitutionalism , 101 MICH. L. REV. 2596, 2599 (2003).

However, the range of decisions discussed in this Article stretch over a wide array of substantive issues, not all of which are obviously linked to economic inequality. Most of these decisions are not about inequality on their face; rather, they contribut e to inequality. Further, the bulk of Supreme Court decisions fly under the radar screen of public scrutiny, further attenuating the constraint of public opinion on the Court. In studies of specific issues that impact inequality, the Court is sometimes ali gned with public opinion, such as with affirmative action in higher education (the public generally supports soft preferences for diversity and rejects quotas) , 460 and sometimes out of alignment, such as with public school 453 See BARTELS , supra note 24, at 150. 454 See PAUL KRUGMAN , THE CONSCIENCE OF A LIBERAL 251 (2d ed. 2009) ( arguing that most Americans believe that government is run \"for a few big interests\"). 455 Jonathan Weisman, Election 2012: Poll Finds Voters are Deeply Divided, WALL ST.

Gore and Citizens United , it retains the support of the public as an institution.463 Its diffuse suppor t is quite strong. What are the implications of this support? In the aftermath of the Court 's decision in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius464 to uphold the individual health care mandate in the Affordable Care Act, news reports speculated that Justice Roberts switched his vote in order to win public support and enhance the legitimacy of the Court.465 On the one hand, this case may demonstrate the majoritarian model in action. On the other hand, Justice Roberts may simply have been articulating his own view of judicial restraint without regard to popular opinion, and indeed, popular opinion was quite split on the advisability of the individual heal th care mandate. Along these lines, Professor Richard Pildes argues that the majoritarian model overstates the constraints on the Court, given that the political branches rarely confront the Court, particularly in highly polarized periods in which a Court majority can garner the support of enough lawmakers to protect itself.466 As a result, \"[t]he modern Court has considerably more latitude to depart from 'majoritarian preferences,' however defined, and the Court knows it. \"467 If the majoritarian model is accu rate, it implies that public opinion on inequality may influence the Court, but only if the public and the Court understand and accept the complex connection between law and economic inequality. Even if the majoritarian model overstates its case, no one\u2014in cluding the Justices themselves 468\u2014denies that the Court is aware of public opinion and that it can sometimes shape Supreme Court decision making. In turn, this suggests that a movement such as Occupy Wall Street can have an impact on the Court, but only to the extent that a Justice' s attitudinal preferences are open to persuasion. In the end, attitude and public opinion can be mutually reinforcing and both appear to play a role in Supreme Court decision making. 461 Michael Murakami, Desegregation, in PUBLIC OPINION AND CONSTITUTIONAL CONTROVERSY , supra note 460, at 18, 18 -39. 462 Manoj Mate & Matthew Wright, The 2000 Presidential Election Controversy , in PUBLIC OPINION AND CONSTITUTIONAL CONTROVERSY , supra note 460, at 333, 347- 48. 463 FRIEDMAN , supra note 448, at 15. 464 132 S.

Solutions In July 2012 economists Jacob Hacker and Nate Loewentheil released a manifesto, full of detailed suggestions for reducing economic inequality,469 which was supported by groups , including the AFL -CIO, Center for Community Change , Economic Policy Institute , Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights , National Council of La Raza and SEIU. The report 's recommendations are organized around the principles of growth, security, and democracy, and its ideas are specific and wide ranging, including spurring job gr owth through infrastructure improvements, guaranteeing college for all, expanding rights to collective bargaining, and limiting corporate lobbying.470 Indeed, there is no shortage of detailed, carefully considered suggestions for reform from these and other experts. After examining the economic literature on inequality, journalist Timothy Noah recommends a progressive tax system, expanding the federal payroll, importing skilled labor, universalizing preschool, controlling the prices of higher education, regul ating Wall Street, electing Democratic presidents, and reviving the labor movement. 471 Stiglitz envisions a similar reform agenda that would increase economic efficiency, fairness, and opportunity by curbing excesses at the top with some redistribution towar ds the 99 %. 472 Professor David Brady calls for tested policies that have proven to work in other affluent democracies.473 In general, these proposals do not address the Supreme Court, other than to call for an overruling of Citizens United . Yet, as this Article demonstrates, Citizens United is just one piece of a much larger problem. We currently have a Court majority that is not only unsympathetic to inequality arguments, but also seemingly oblivious to (or skeptical of) the connection between government policies and market outcomes. The Court has ruled that it is up to the legislative branch, rather than the Courts, to remedy economic inequality. Yet, the Court has doomed legislative enactments that would ameliorate inequality, such as desegreg ation plans, campaign finance reforms, and consumer protection laws. Conversely, when legislatures enact policies that tend to worsen economic inequality or magnify its effects, the Court defers, such as school financing laws and voter identification requi rements. In short, the Court 's rulings consistently sustain policies that create or maintain economic inequality. Nevertheless, and in the spirit of the OWS movement, progressive lawyers can develop strategies for expanding social justice, using the tools that lawyers can bring to the table. After all, the Court 's membership will change with new 469 JACOB S.

Thus, t his Article makes five suggestions for the economic justice lawy ering movement. First, we need to continue to develop theoretical and doctrinal frameworks centered on economic fairness. Second, we need to engage with other disciplines in building a social science record that reveals the connection between law, policy, and economic hardship. Third, progressive lawyering movements need to recognize the role of class in racial and gender disparities and to advance a robust economic justice movement that benefits the entire 99%. Fourth, we need multidisciplinary strategies for fighting economic injustice that expand beyond litigation and courts to ensure rights. Finally, we need to expand access to justice in order to ensure that the judicial system is responsive to the 99 %. 1. A Legal Philosophy of Equality To begin with, progressive lawyers need to continue the work of Professor Frank Michelman and other scholars to develop legal theories that promote and sustain economic justice for the 99 %. In the 1970s, as the Court appeared poised to enforce social and economic rights, Michelman reflected upon the political philosophy of John Rawls and advocated for a baseline minimum of social and economic rights in lieu of equality, as the Court is better suited to articulate the former than the latter. 474 Professor Willi am Forbath extended Michelman 's theory and argued that a baseline minimum should include not only welfare, but also a right to dignified work in order to ensure social citizenship for all.475 He asserts that welfare alone cannot ensure political equality or \" undo the stigma of permanent exclusion from a shared destiny of work and opportunity.\"476 Using a more communitarian framework, Professor Goodwin Liu veers away from Rawlsian notions of justice to endorse political philosopher Michael Walzer 's thoery of \" shared understandings.\" 477 In Walzer 's approach, society arrives at a consensus about essential welfare goods through its \"institutions, laws, and practices. \"478 Liu acknowledges that under this approach, law follows politics, which in turn suggests a focus on the political branches to effectuate change.479 As 474 Frank I.

Giving up on constitutional claims for economic justice can become a self -fulfilling prophecy,483 as can ceding legitimacy to conservative interpretations of the constitution.484 One need only look at the Court 's reversal of its views with regard to the criminalization of homosexual conduct to know that theory need s to be ready and waiting when the Court catches up to societal norms. 2. The Facts of Economic Inequality Theory alone is not enough. Courts need to see a factual record that reveals the connections between government policies and economic inequality and debunks the idea that the market always produces fair outcomes. They need to be educated about the real world consequences of the decisions they make. 485 Many of the books cited in this Article, written by renowned economists, political scientists, and j ournalists, make this case through careful empirical analysis. Thus, interdisciplinary explanations regarding economic inequality are available for lawyers to present to courts. Further, social scientists have established that one 's economic status is not determined solely by behavior, as the majority of Justices seem to assume, but rather, that structural economic factors are at play.486 This challenges the Justices' ingrained notions of deservedness. 480 See id. at 266. 481 See James E.

While debates have raged between the behaviorist and structuralist explanations for poverty, sociologist William Julius Wilson instead explains how behavioral and structural factors intersect .497 His work focuses on low -income, urban, African- American communities, and he has shown how people who grow up in racially segregated, poor neighborhoods develop coping mechanisms and responses that \"emerge from patterns of racial exclusion\" a nd end up limiting social mobility .498 Accordingly, Wilson concludes that \"structural factors are likely to play a far greater role than cultural factors in bringing about rapid neighborhood change. As he points out, a strong economy lessens poverty (and its associated pathologies), while a we ak economy increases poverty. If culture were determinative, then increased economic opportunity would not have a transformative impact in poor communities. 499 In short, structural forces drive behavioral responses, and th e resultant behavior \"often reinforces the very conditions that have emerged from structural inequities.\"500 Most judges do not come to the bench with these sophisticated understandings about poverty; thus, this is an area where cross- disciplinary explanations and evidence may make a difference to legal advocacy. 3.

For instance, a professional in the top 10% has a far different life experience than an individual who is homeless because he recently lost his job. Not surprisingly then, Occupy Wall Street did not generate its own political movement; its base of suppor t was extremely diffuse. A social -justice movement dedicated to legal change needs to mobilize multiple constituencies, while recognizing shared interests and marked differences.517 4. Multidimensional Strategies As lawyers in both progressive and conservative social -change movements know well, litigation is not the only way to reform law or even the best way. Rather, there are multiple tools for effectuating systemic change, including community organizing,518 legislative and administrative advocacy, civil dis - obedience, public education,519 and community education.520 Indeed, the Occupy Wall Street movement combined elements of organizing, protest, media attention, and social -media activism. While it did not attempt to change law directly, Occupy Wall Str eet altered public and political dialogue, and probably helped lay the groundwork for the fiscal cliff deal reached by President Obama and Congress in early 2013, a central piece of which was higher taxes for top earners. Notably, Occupy Wall Street was no t a rights -based movement; it focused on a societal critique rather than affirmative claims. Lawyers who advocate for social reform disagree over the utility of rights- based strategies. On the one hand, the major social -justice movements in the 1960s and 1970s , such as the fight for civil rights and gender equality, were focused on attaining rights for subordinated people and relied on the persuasive power of rights -based discourse and the legal power of rights -based claims.

For instance, the foreclosure crisis \u2014a key ingredient of the Great Recession and a focus of Occupy Wall Street protests \u2014had many causes, requiring multiple responses. Roots of the crisis included a rise in subprime and predatory lending fueled by low interest rates; risk taking behavior by lenders and borrowers; lender fraud; a burst in the housing market bubble that led to the rapid devaluation of housing prices; an economic downturn that lead to financial hardship and inability by some homeowners to pay mortgages; a lack of regulatory oversight of the mortgage market and ratings agencies; and the collapse of the asset -backed securitized mortgage market.537 Notably, the foreclosure crisis was fueled by and magnified income inequality.538 Social justice advocates have responded to this crisis with a wide variety of tactics in the hopes of helping homeowners and tenants remain in their homes. Lawyers have worked with community groups to educate homeowners about the ir rights.539 Lawyers have filed class actions challenging a wide array of discriminatory, unfair, and misleading lending practices. 540 Lawyers have represented individuals in court and in new forums of alternative dispute resolution.541 Lawyers have provided fe deral policymakers with recommendations based on their on- the-ground perspectives.542 Lawyers have moved legislatures to enact new protections and processes to govern the foreclosure process.543 While litigation has been a piece of the response to the 537 U.S. DEP'T OF HOUSING & URBAN DEV., REPORT TO CONGRESS ON T HE ROOT CAUSES OF THE FORECLOSURE CRISIS vii-xi (2010), available at http://www.huduser.org/P ublications/PDF/Foreclosure_09.pdf (summarizing the literature on the crisis). 538 Raymond H.

Likewise, other areas of economic inequality will require similarly broad - based, creative, and coordinated approaches. 5. Access to Justice Of course, the Supreme Cour t is not the entire story of how law reinforces inequality. The judicial branch encompasses federal, state, and administrative courts, and these fora have much greater day -to-day contact with the 99% . Indeed, most Americans have contact with the judicial b ranch through lower -level district courts when they owe a debt, are part of a dissolving family, or are accused of committing a crime. Yet , there is no right to civil legal counsel, and as a result, \"the market controls the distribution, availability, and quality of legal services. \" 544 The market outcome is grim. Fewer than one in five low -income people have access to a lawyer for their civil legal problems,545 while only two to three -fifths of middle -income Americans can afford civil legal help.546 Fewer than 1% of the nation' s total legal expenditures go to the bottom seventh of Americans who qualify for legal aid,547 and thus , poor litigants are left to fend for themselves pro se. Moreover, the fora where these low -income citizens often appear have none of the trappings of the Supreme Court. On the one hand, harried judges may be presiding over hundreds of cases in a single day ; on the other hand, administrative law judges may take months to process even basic claims for benefits.548 With regard to criminal justice systems, the vast majority of criminal defendants are indigent.549 While they have a formal right to counsel, this righ t is illusory given that 90 % of defendants plead out with no factual investigation on their case, largely because public defenders are grossly overworked and underpaid.550 This lack of equal access to justice compounds economic inequality for those who cannot afford lawyers, experts, and other accoutrement of modern day The Foreclosure Crisis and Its Impact on Tenants , NAT'L HOUSING L.

As Professor Deborah Rhode says, \"[w]e tolerate a system in which money often matters more than merit, and equal protection principles are routinely subverted in practice. \"551 Thus, any progressive movement aimed at reducing income inequality needs to consider reforms of the entire judicial system and to strategize around ways to give voice and fair process to the 99 %. Professor Robert Rubinson identifies proposals that work within e xisting frameworks, such as expansions of pro bono programs, enhanced government spending on legal representation for the poor, and a right to counsel in civil cases. 552 Further, he suggests reforms that are more transformative and that break the reliance on lawyers to achieve justice, such as evolving models of alternative dispute resolution and community lawyering, in which lawyers help communities reach their self -defined goals through organizing, lobbying, and transactional law.553 These multidimensional approaches may not only hold greater promise for expanding access to justice, but also for achieving justice. C ONCLUSION The Occupy Wall Street protests in 2011 focused public attention on economic inequality , as well as the role of government policies in contributing to economic inequality. The invisible or impartial hand of the marketplace does not cause economic inequality. Rather, the marketplace exists and operates within a framework established by government. President Obama amplified the themes of Occupy Wall Street, calling economic equality the \"defining issue of our time, \" in his 2012 State of the Union Address. 554 In line with this theme, Obama supported the 2009 stimulus legislation, health care coverage for the uninsured in the Affordable Care Act, and he repeatedly called on the 1% to pay their share of the nation' s tax bill.555 After winning re -election, in 2013 his State of the Union featured several additional proposals to reduce economic inequality, such as a rise in the minimum wage and universal preschool. In his 2014 State of the Union, President Obama again addressed inequality, which \"has deepened,\" and he accordingly pushed ideas such as stricter enforcement of equal pay laws for women, an expansion of unemployment insurance, and a higher minimum wage .556 Laws and measures such as these recognize the role of government in both creating 551 RHODE , supra note 546, at 3. 552 Rubinson, supra note 544, at 100 n.10, 139, 153- 54. 553 Id. at 139 -44, 153; see supra notes 534- 543 and a ccompanying text. 554 Remarks by the President in State of the Union Address , WHITEHOUSE .GOV (Jan. 24, Fighting Income Inequality Became Obama's Driving Force , WASH.

Nevertheless, the judicial branch is rarely part of the narrative of economic inequality, despite its significant impact. The Supreme Court reinforces economic inequality by selectively employing deference to legislative judgments. When legislatures act to level the playing field, the Court generally abandons deference, such as with voluntary desegregation plans, consumer protection and employment statutes, and campaign finance laws. By contrast, when legislatures pass laws that engender economic inequality, the Court is happy to defer, such as with school financing laws, voter identification requirements, and punitive social welfare policies. Either way, the 99% do not win. Thus, any social movement for economic equality needs to consider t he impact of the judiciary and its potential for reforming law. Extreme levels of economic inequality harm our entire society . To succeed as a nation, we need laws and a judiciary that serves us all \u2014the full 100%. 465 JAILING BLACK BABIES James G. Dwyer * I. INTRODUCTION In reaction to the tremendous increase in incarceration of poor and minority - race adult s, perceiving that such adults suffer from losing not only liberty but also family ties , and c iting the damage that children suffer from parental incarceration, advocates for prisoners have promoted programs to increase inmates' contact with their children. When convinced that such programs re duce criminal recidivism, legislators and prison officials have approved and funded such programs. As described in Part I, children -in-prison programs, which predominantly involve children of minority race, range widely in the degree to which they make pri son a part of children's lives. At the extreme, t here is a fast-growing phenomenon of states placing newborn children into prisons to live for months or years with their incarcerated mothers, most ly in separate units termed \"prison nurseries .\" Prison nurseries have not come at the urging of advocates for child ren, and they have procee ded without research support for any hope of positive child welfare outcomes .1 As explained in Part I I, there is still no evidence that increased contact with incarcerated parents is on balance good for children, whereas there is much reason to believe that bring ing children into prisons is detrimental for them and that this is especially true for minority -race children . Indeed, there is also no evidence that the programs serve the aim of reducing recidivism. That advocates for prison inmates are inclined to support placement of babies in adult prisons , without empirical basis for believing it is good for the children and without seriously conside ring the obvious alternative of adoption, betrays their willingness to use children in an instrumental way to ameliorate the suffering of disadvantaged adults . Further evidence of this instrumental attitude toward predominantly minority - race babies is the complete absence of consideration about whether prison nurseries transgress legal limits on states' power to put people in prison . Yet , there certainly are limits , ones of tremendous importance to adults. The fact that some person s are dependent and not self -determining cannot possibly mean they have no * \u00a9 2014 James G. Dwyer. Arthur B. Hanson Professor of Law, William & Mary School of Law.

Indeed, there would likely be widespread public outrage if any state began putting mentally disabled or senile adults in prisons with incarcerated relatives in the hope that this would reduce recidivism and provide some benefits to those incompetent adul ts. Part III of this Article therefore presents the first analysis ever of how constitutional and statutory rules governing incarceration and civil commitment should apply to programs under which the state places children in prisons. It concludes that existing programs patently violate children's Fourteenth Amendment substantive and procedural due process rights. If such imprisonment were ever constitutionally permissible, it could only be after an individualized determination by a competent state authority, based on clear and convincing evidence, that it is necessary , in order to avoid substantial harm to a particular child , for the state to place that child in prison rather than in any available non - incarceration alternative plac ement , including adoption. No existing prison nursery program satisfies this test . In addition, prison nurseries violate statutory prohibitions on housing minors with incarcerated adults\u2014 laws enacted with juvenile delinquents in mind but whose language and underlying premises extend to all children. Thus, prison nurseries clearly contravene constitutional rights of and statutory protections for children , and s tates should discontinue them immediately. II.

Indeed, loss of gratifying intimate relationships is part of the suffering that makes imprisonment a deterrent to criminal activity. However, motivated principally by a belief that they can reduce recidivism following convi cts' release, legislators and prison administrators have in recent years adopted new programs to increase communication and contact between inmates and their families \u2014in particular, their offspring. 22 Some such programs involve simply more communication bet ween parents and children. A number of men's prisons, for example, have introduced parenting programs that encourage fathers to write letters to their children or record themselves reading books.23 A small number of male prisons go beyond normal visitation procedures to facilitate greater personal contact with children by allowing more private and extended visits or furloughs (i.e., brief return s of the inmate s to the community).24 (asserting that \"[i]mmediately after delivery, their newborns are automatically placed in foster care in the vast majority of states\"). 20 See, e.g. , TIMOTHY ROSS ET AL ., VERA INST. OF JUSTICE , HARD DATA ON HARD TIMES : AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF MATERNAL INCARCERATION , FOSTER CARE, AND VISITATION 9-10 (2004) (finding that 85% of the children of incarcerated women in New York who are in foster care were in foster care before the mother's arrest that led to incar ceration), available at http://www.prisonpolicy.org/scans/vera/245_461.pdf.

Most female p risons now have special areas and longer hours for mother -child visits.25 Many have parenting programs for female inmates that entail young children spending several hours a week in supervised group play sessions with their mothers.26 Some allow furloughs so mothers can spend time with their children in a more natural, community setting.27 And some are going further and having children stay overnight in prisons. For example, the Tennessee Prison for Women allows inmates to have children under six stay with them for one weekend per month. 28 B. Prison Nurseries The most extreme effort to connect incarcerated women with their children is a fast -growing trend to create prison nurseries, units within prisons where infants live full- time with their mothers. New Yo rk State has operated one at Bedford Hills, a maximum -security prison forty miles north of New York City, for over a century. In the mid -twentieth century, a dozen or so other states allowed incarcerated mothers to keep their children in prison with them, but they discontinued the practice in the 1970s, a time of increased consciousness regarding children's rights, citing concerns about children's safety and well -being.29 Brian Handwerk, Mothers Behind Bars: What Happens to the Children?, NAT'L GEOGRAPHIC NEWS, http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/06/0613_030613_pris onkids. html (last updated Jan. 30, 2004) (describing weekend afternoon programs in Louisiana women's prisons). 25 Joycelyn M.

The U.S. Department of Justice issued a call for grant proposals to develop more prison nursery programs in 2010,33 advocates advance prison nursery legislative proposals in additional states each year,34 and a recent report exclaimed that \"unprecedented bi -partisan support currently exists for 30 VILLANUEVA , supra note 1, at 27 -33; Ken Kusmer, Nursery Programs Allow Imprisoned Moms, Newborns to Bond, SEATTLE TIMES (May 11, 2008), http://seattletimes. com/html/na tionworld/2004405371_apbabiesbehindbars.html (stating that Indiana lau- nched its program of imprisoning babies with a grant from the federal Department of Health and Human Services).

Even a petition for custody from the baby's legal father appears to be insufficient to block prison officials from sending his child to live in prison.55 Illinois 's program is typical of the new wave of prison nursery experiment s.

Background Legal Rules for Parentage and Custody To understand how young children end up living in prisons requires familiarity with certain background legal rules for parentage and handling of prison births. State laws confer legal parent status on every child's birth mother.62 There is no basis for denying initial legal parent status to her ; in particular, there is no exclusion based on unfitness or incapacity. The state can remove legal parent status from someone unwilling or unable to care for an offspring under laws authorizing termination of parental rights (TPR) . That almost never happens , however, as a result of parental incarceration per se63 because typically, in most states, child welfare agencies are not involved when a child is born to a woman already in prison.64 Instead, absent a nursery program, the baby's father or, more commonly, some other family member designated by the mother simply takes the baby from the prison or birthing facility.65 The baby then lives in temporary kin care, subject to reclamation by the mother upon her release.66 58 See Huey Freeman, Illinois Prison Program Guides New Mothers , PANTAGRAPH .COM (Apr. 11df-97d4- 001cc4c002e0.html. .

One might expect, given that these mothers typically want to be able to collec t the child as soon as they leave prison, that they will choose someone who does not wish to be a permanent caretaker for the child. A large literature has documented the adverse outcomes for children in this situation , most of whom are left in poor and dangerous communities, passed from one overburdened custodian to another and living under the cloud of having a \"real\" parent who is an incarcerated criminal.72 These children are at very high risk for mental health problems, substance abuse, unintended pregnancy, dropping out of school, gang involvement, chronic unemployment, and incarceration as adults.73 The intergenerational cycle is clear.74 it is unclear what.

But the option of placing children in confinement with their mothers i s the only alternative that receives attention. No laws direct prison officials to encourage mothers to consider relinquishing a baby for adoption, let alone trigger CPS or court consideration of adoption for the baby, and there is no evidence that any pri son officials or social workers on their own initiative urge pregnant inmates to consider adoption. They would likely incur recrimination from women's advocacy organizations if they did so. In any event, prison nursery programs will likely foreclose the possibility of adoption. Women facing a year or more of incarceration who are offered the opportunity to move to a nicer unit and live with the baby they just delivered are exceedingly unlikel y to decline that opportunity. Moreover, if any female convicts do contemplate acting altruistically by choos ing adoption, to give their babies the best chance for a happy and fulfilling life, the tremendous push that self -appointed advocates for women pri soners are now making for children- in-prison programs suggests that these women would be under tremendous pressure to hold on to their offspring.

As discussed below, the first study of attachment outcomes for prison nursery babies in the U.S. was published in 2010, even though the Bedford Hills prison nursery has existed for over a century.87 The only studi es of child welfare impact available to the seven states that created prison nurseries in the fifteen years before 2010, therefore, would have been a 1980s study of child development in U nited Kingdom prison nurseries \u2014which found \"progressive developmental decline in motor and cognitive scores . . . for all nursery infants after admission to the unit\"88\u2014and two observational studies of the Bedford Hills program in the early 1990s that found physical and cognitive developmental delays in a large percentage of the children.89 Moreover, this unsupported child welfare speculation typically operates against a background assumption that the only alternative for a child is the current default regime of \"bouncing around\" among relatives or spending childhood in foster care.90 But that is clearly false, given that the number of Americans wishing to adopt an infant far exceeds the number of infants currently available for adoption, 91 as well as the fact that children adopted soon after birth have developmental outcomes as good as or better than the general population and far better than children raised in the types of homes and communities from which most incarcerated women come. 92 Adoption could also 86 Cf.

In any case, the i deal depicted by advocates for prison nurseries, and the expectation of legislators and prison officials who approve them, is this: The state will place newborns into prison with the birth mothers .

The Realities Without knowing much about the programs or studies on the effects of bringing children into prisons, one might suppose there are good and bad aspects for children. While in prison, they get more time with their biological mothers , and the parents might be more attentive than they would be at home. On the other hand, prisons are typically unhappy, stressful, and dangerous places where most nonincarcerated parents would likely never bring their own children for any reason. 1. Mothers' Incapacity As to the positive dimension of children being with their birth mothers rather than in the care of someone who is not in prison, one must bear in mind that incarcerated women are generally not well functioning, psychologically healthy people who happen to land in pr ison one day because of aberrational misconduct. 95 To the contrary, the great majority of these women suffer from deep, serious mental health problems and addictions and h ave been involved in criminal activity for a long time.96 Most had very poor upbringing s themselves\u2014a large portion having suffered from physical or sexual abuse as children \u2014and never developed a secure attachment to their own parents.97 Dysfunction typically runs through the 95 The frequent claim that a large portion of the prison population consists of people who committed minor drug offenses is false.

For example, other prisoners are likely to resent women who receive special treatment because of their children, and prison nurseries entail the additional tension arising from babies' uncontrolled noise, especially during the night.117 Many incarcerated women, both those in nursery units and those in normal units, describe prison life as socially and emotionally isolating, entailing complete severance of ties with family and friends and conditions not conducive to forming positive new ties, which compounds their struggles with depression, guilt, (discussing vario us arguments for why incarcerated mothers should not be allowed to raise their newborn children in prison). 114 See, e.g. , Amy Littlefield, Mothers Behind Bars: The Prison Birth Project Helps Women in Prison with Pregnancy, Delivery and Parenting , VALLEY ADVOCATE (June 24, 2010) (relating inmate's description of \"[t]he structure of life in the jail\u2014the strip searches, the uniformed guards, the heavily controlled schedule, the medications used to sedate her \u2014 made [the inmate] feel stripped of her right to be an emotional person.

That potential punishment, along with difficulty of proof, officials' lack of sym pathy for criminals, and a code of secrecy , give guards near impunity.122 A prison guard is not likely to become kind and nurturing just because an inmate has a baby with her.123 A study of New York's two prison nurseries found \"crowded conditions and negativ e interactions with corrections officers and nursery staff.

Unhealthy E nvironment The same conditions that exacerbate inmates' psychological and personality problems are also likely to affect children adversely, both directly \u2014by exposing them to the same hostile and stifling atmosphere \u2014and indirectly \u2014by disturbing their caregivers. In most nursery programs, babies come into contact not just with other mother -child pairs but al so with inmates who do not have a child with them in prison, either because these other inmates serve as day care workers or because the babies live in a unit that contains inmates who do not have child ren with them. 127 Such contact with other inmates increases risk of harm and disease.128 In some prisons, inmates have access to drugs,129 and women in the nursery who know or suspect the guards are going to have them ejected are likely to act in a 124 Goshin & Byrne, supra note 35, at 278 (citing Katherine Gabel & Kathryn Girard, Long- Term Care Nurseries in Prison: A Descriptive Study , in CHILDREN OF INCARCERATED PARENTS 237, 253 (Katherine Gabel & Denise Johnston eds., 1995); R.

Infant brains process information from their environments intensely, and experiences even in the earliest days of life can psychologically affect a child throughout life.134 Although prison officials endeavor to make nursery units more pleasant, they are still units in a prison \u2014populated by prison inmates , controlled by prison guards , subject to the strict prison regimentation , and very limited in both space and variety of experiences. A team of child development experts summarized concerns about children's well -being s in prison nurseries: Prison is by constraining institution. . . . . . . Living space is reduced and children often share small cells with their mothers. This spatial shrinking is in contradiction with a child's needs to move, to discover his environment and to be surrounded by a rich and diversified milieu. Prison also imposes strict temporal constraints. Activities take place in rigid and regulated seque nces. . . . While regularity is a good thing for a child, it goes too far in prison . . . . 130 See, e.g. , id. (describing an incident in a Canadian prison in which a woman, after learning her child had been removed because the woman refused a drug test, took a guard hostage). 131 See Goshi n & Byrne, supra note 118, at 94 (noting that inmates suffer a higher rate of asthma compared to nonincarcerated persons). 132 See VILLANUEVA , supra note 1, at 9. 133 Id.; Vallely, supra note 119 (noting that Britain generally does not permit mothers to keep their children in prison mother -baby units after they reach eighteen months because \"[a]fter that, child development experts say , the harmful effects of being in an institution start to outweigh the benefits of being with their mother\"). 134 See Douglas F.

Just visiting a parent in prison can be upsetting for children because of the prison's ominous environment, hostile guards and inmates, harsh procedures, and radical disempowerment of the parent.139 A recent study found \"visitation during a mother's incarceration predicted less child attachment security.\"140 Many custodians of children in the community , whose mother s are in prison, object to visits because they believe, often based on past experience, that entering the prison environment will traumatize the children.141 Many courts , also citing concern about the psychological impact visiting a pri son may have on children, have refused to issue orders sought after by prisoners that would require a child's caretaker to bring the child to prison for visitation.142 Many prison officials likewise express this worry.143 Even many mothers in visitation or nur sery programs themselves voice the view that prison is no place for children and their worr ies about the impact that the prison environment might have.144 One mother , whose son spent some weekends with her in a Tennessee prison, stated that \"she hopes his 2- year-old brain isn't capable of remembering his formative years in prison.\"145 Few advocates for placing children in prisons acknowledge, let alone address the implications of, the potential harms to children from entering such a tense, stressful, antagonis tic, demoralizing, and stifling & Murray, supra note 72, at 294 -95; Catherine J.

E.g., Abramowicz, supra note 90, at 872 -73 (discussing community -based facilities as a 494 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 bolster their position by cagily asserting that adverse effects on children have not been shown147 while failing to mention that there has been almost no effort among child development researchers to study the effects on children.148 Some rely on an assertion that the prison environment is better than the neighborhoods the mothers came from.149 Although this is likely true in some respects (e.g., less violence and drug abuse in prison), they overlook the r eality that women exiting prison almost always return to wherever they came from, and these advocates studiously avoid the topic of adoption, a far more attractive option for newborns than either the default regime or prison. 3. Improbability of A ttachment A crucial empirical claim many advocates assert is that, despite any adversities in the prison environment, a child will form a secure attachment with the mother that will constitute a basis for a healthy and permanent mother -child relationship.150 Yet there is no evidence that visitation programs accomplish this,151 and what little evidence there is of outcomes for former prison nursery babies suggests that only a small percentage meet this expectation. As explained below, available evidence suggest s children -in-prison programs are actually more likely to undermine attachment and produce even worse outcomes than the default regime. By this measure, prison nurseries are a failure for the vast majority of children and a reckless gamble for all. \"place for mothers . . . t o live with their children and avoid the separation and trauma that the mother's incarceration in a prison facility would inflict on the child\"); Pollack, supra note 25, at 19 -7 (noting that furloughs avoid subjecting children \"to the negative and frightening elements of a prison visit\"); R EPORT CARD, supra note 4, at 30 (stating that a community -based nursery is \"far better situated to serve the unique physical and emotional needs of a mother and her child\" than is a prison nursery). 147 See, e.g. , Alexander's Testimony , supra note 19; An Act Establishing a Child Nursery Facility at the Connecticut Correctional Institution, Niantic: Hearing on H.B. 6642 Before the Judiciary C omm.

Secure attachment is the foundation for healthy child development and appropriate social and emotional functioning later in life.152 Children who fail to form a secure attachment \"tend to see the world as threatening and unpredictable\"153 and consequently \"have difficulties with anxiety, anger, aggression, depression, and mental disorganization.\"154 These psychological effects in turn lead to deficiencies in phys ical health and development, \"cognitive problems, speech and language delays, sensory integration difficulties and . . . social and behavioral abnormalities.\" 155 Attachment failure emo- tional development and produces emotional withdrawal, indis criminate socializing, lack of impulse control, failure to internalize moral norms, and psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, hyperactivity, and disruptive behavior.\"156 Adults who failed to form a secure attachment as children have great diffic ulty with intimate relationships, social interactions, and control of impulses and emotions ; thus, they are at high risk for psychopathology and sociopathology, as well as criminal behavior likely to lead them to prison.157 In short, attachment failure is the root cause of the intergenerational cycle of dysfunction and criminality. For many reasons, p utting babies in prison with incarcerated birth mothers is not a sensible strategy for promoting healthy attachment. First, as explained above, prison is far from a nurturing environment, and mothers \"who are anxious or preoccupied with their own difficulties tend to be inconsistently responsive, causing the children in their care to develop an insecure pattern of attachment.\"158 Second, incarcerated women's long -standing psychological and emotional problems pose an obstacle to their ability to give babies the kind of attention and interactions the babies need.159 Third, there are the crucial matters of timing and continuity, which ar e given far too little attention in the literature and policy discussions about prison nurseries. The critical time period for attachment begins 152 Makariev & Shaver, supra note 11, at 314. 153 Id. at 315. 154 Id. 155 Charles H.

For a wom an whose release is scheduled six to eighteen months after the child's birth, the attachment process might have begun but not proceeded far when the mother is thrust back into the community and all its challenges. The enormous stress of reentry, discussed further below, can interfere with the attachment process even if a moth er and child remain together . The reality is that separation is very common because many mothers resume substance abuse, reenter prison, commit child maltreatment, or simply become unwilling or unable to retain custody of their children.165 For women whose r elease dates are beyond 160 Jaff\u00e9 et al., supra note 135, at 404; Daniel S.

Barriers to R eentry Advocates for prison nurseries generally avoid discussing what mothers and infants face when the mothers complete their sentence. Yet in other contexts , advocates for incarcerated women regularly emphasize the formidable challenges these women face upon reentry.171 Those challenges largely explain the very high rate at which mothers separate from prison babies after release. One commentator warns of potential difficulties : [M]ost inmate- mothers have low literacy, limited education, limited work experience, and past alcohol, drug, or mental health problems. These limitations, in addition to their criminal records, severely curtail post-release employment opportunities for mothers who have been incarcerated. In addition . . . these women are likely to have court -ordered demands on their time. If past alcohol, drug, or mental health problems are a matter of record . . . when a mother is released, she must be referred for treatment ordered by the court, as well as aftercare ordered as a condition of her release to community supervision. There are often waiting lists for such programs and often delays in referrals from her caseworker as well. In addition . . . the mother must attend court hearings relevant to [any child neglect, abandonment, or abuse proceedings]. These h earings are often adjourned multiple times. If a mother must attend multiple court hearings, substance abuse programs, and other requirements of both the Department of Corrections and the Bureau of Child Welfare, along with reestablishing periods of visita tion with her children, it is doubtful she will keep her employment for long. . . . However, without such employment she cannot hope to provide a home for her children . . . . 172 171 See, e.g. , BLOOM ET AL ., supra note 83, at 16, 21. 172 Day, supra note 83, at 236 -37; see also Carlson, supra note 47, at 22 (noting that hoped- for \"afterc are programs to help women and their babies transition smoothly from the prison to the community\" have not materialized \"due to a lack of funding\"); Stephanie S.

Federal law requires states to exclude from welfare benefits and food stamp programs individuals who have been convicted of a felony involving possession, use, or distribution of drugs.177 This leaves many without means to house, feed, and clothe themselves, let alone take care of children and search for work.178 Living with relatives is not an option for those whose relatives are poor and therefore unable to add another member to the household, or for those with relatives in public housing who could be evicted if an ex-convict liv es with them.179 Some job training and educational loan programs exclude ex -convicts, yet mos t mothers ha ve neither a high school diploma nor job skills when they enter prison, and, in any event , these women need employment immediately just to survive and cannot devote time to such programs.180 Additionally, returning to the community after even jus t one year in prison is women upon release from prison); Pfaff, supra note 5, at 1107- 08 (discussing the \"collateral costs\" of incarceration). 173 See, e.g. , Jacobs, supra note 103, at 811; Mawhorr, supra note 42, at 26; Quinn, supra note 28 (noting that one woman's \"mother is raising her 2 - and 3 -year old sons, but is so angry at her for getting in trouble that she had her phone blocked from receiving calls from her daughter\"). 174 See BLOOM ET AL ., supra note 83, at 16; Goshin & Byrne, supra note 118, at 95; Creasie Finney Hairston & James Rol lin, Prisoner Reentry: Social Capital and Family Connections , in WOMEN AND GIRLS, supra note 8, at 4 -1, 4-3-4-5. 175 Abramowicz, supra 90, McGalliard, supra note 108; Michael Pinard & Anthony C.

One former prison- nursery mother explained, \"The funny thing about addiction is it doesn't matter how much you love your child. It doesn't matter how much you want to do good . . . . The addiction has this force that if you don't address what the issues are surrounding the addiction, you're always going to go back to it.\" 192 Another, who had entered prison pregnant three times, said that after each time she was paroled, she \"did what I normally did on the outside because that's what addicts do. We're selfish. . . . The babies aren't going to get us clean . . . . I have six kids and that didn't cure me.\"193 Advocates for women in prison nevertheless commonly assert that programs unifying them with their children greatly reduce recidivism rates, thus lessening the chance of later separation.194 This pitch is crucial to winning the support of et al., supra note 4, at 143 (\"Compared to men, women are less likely to use drugs for pleasure. Instead, women use drugs to 'self -medicate' depression or stress, to numb themselves from the emotional pain of abuse, or as a means to escape from conditi ons of poverty that create emotional stress.\"); id. at 144- 45 (\"Fifty -one percent of the women committed to California prisons in 2004 were parolees returned to custody. . . .

But there is actually no evidentiary support for th e claim, and the foregoing discussion gives reason for skepticism. No studies purport to show reduced recidivism as a result of visitation programs, and those that advocates tout as showing nursery programs cause a reduction in reoffense rate in fact do no such thing. Many advocates cite a report from the Nebraska Correctional Center for Women , which states that in the four years before initiation of a prison nursery , one-third of women who delivered a baby while incarcerated returned to prison within three years because of a new crime, whereas in the first five years of the nursery program , only 9% of nursery graduates had returned after release.195 Some cite similar statistics in two other states (26% vs. 13% in New York and 39% vs. 17% in Washington) as supposed proof that prison nurseries cause a reduction in recidivism.196 But that is a misuse of data that anyone with minimal social science sophistication would recognize. These studies clearly suffer from a selection -bias problem; in layman's terms, they comp are apples and oranges. Nursery participants are a special subset of all women who give birth while incarcerated. The states in which these studies were conducted all impose some form of screening that excludes candidates who are especially unpromising bec ause of their history, taking into account the seriousness of their crimes , as reflected in the (asserting that participating in prison nursery programs cuts a woman's chances of reoffending in half); Erin Jordan, Prison Nurseries Cut Female Inmates' Risk of Reoffending, GAZETTE (Jan. 31, 2011, 7:52 AM), http://thegazette.com/2011/01/31/prison - nurseries -cut-female -inmates -risk-of-reoffending/ (quoting Jose ph Carlson, author of the report on Nebraska's prison nursery, as saying that \"[the program] reduces recidivism\"). 195 See, e.g. , Gilad & Gat, supra note 19, at 388; Goshin & Byrne, supra note 35, at 276; Vainik, supra note 12, at 683. A more recent report on recidivism in Nebr aska, by the same researcher, Carlson, supra note 47, which will also likely be widely cited with the false claim that it proves prison nurseries reduce recidivism, claims that the prenursery recidivism rate was actually 50%, for the same four -year period studied in the earlier report. Id. at 21 -22. It also found a higher recidivism rate \u201417% \u2014than in the earlier study for women who completed the pris on nursery program. Id. For both groups, the sample was rather small, and the researcher failed to indicate whether the rate difference was statistically significant. Id. at 22 (showing a sample of thirty mothers for the prenursery period and sixty -five pr ison nursery mothers for the ten -year period studied). In addition, it appears the researcher did not look at a set time period following reentry for all released inmates, such as three years postrelease, but rather looked for any recidivism up to the year 2007 for members of the two groups. This means the study looked at recidivism within seventeen years for some women and recidivism within three years for others, which obviously undermines the comparison. This study also suffers from the selection bias problems discussed below, though the author of the report did not acknowledge this. 196 See, e.g. , Carlson, supra note 47, at 18, 22 (providing recidivism statistics for nine states that allow incarcerated mothers to keep their babies). 504 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 length of their sentence s.197 As noted above, most programs categorically exclude women with longer sentences, histories of violence, or past child maltreatment convictions. Moreover, the prison nursery group in these studies does not include the substantial percentage of mothers who begin the nursery program but then drop out, either by choice or because of disciplinary action; the studies do not count them in the nursery group but rather in the nonnursery group, thus further stacking the deck in favor of finding a positive outcome with nursery mothers relative to other inmates.198 At most , these comparative recidivism figures support a conclusion that the women who enter and complete a prison nursery program as currently operated are at a lower risk of returning to prison than are other inmates. But this might be so entirely because those women have characteristics that would have translated into a low reoffense rate even if there were no nursery program. These figures in no way show that imprisoning babies with female criminals heals those inmates or changes their dispositions. Indeed, the cited statistics are consistent with a hypothesis that nursery programs increa se recidivism for that special population. The programs could have this effect if having babies with them distracts women from rehabilitative work they need to do, prevents them from advancing educationally, undermines the deterrent impact of incarceration, 199 or imposes a responsibility on them that upon leaving prison becomes a source of great additional stress for them. We simply do not know what the recidivism rate would be for those women who qualify for and persist through the nursery progr ams in the absence of those programs, so claims that the programs have been shown to reduce recidivism are indefensible and irresponsible. That the programs attempt to screen out higher -risk inmates counts in their favor from a child- centered perspective. But the primary reason legislators and prison officials support these programs \u2014namely, the promise that they will cause a reduction in recidivism \u2014remains entirely speculative. Some prison directors themselves express strong skepticism. An Ohio Department o f Rehabilitation and Correction assessment of th e state's prison nursery concluded, after describing the poor service delivery in the program, the limited time the women were in the program, the fact that the great majority of them already had children whe n they entered prison, and the severe difficulties they faced upon exit, that \"program developers should not expect that this 'programming' will have any impact on the likelihood that these women will recidivate.\" 200 197 See, e.g. , id. at 21 (stating that thirty women were denied entry into the prison nursery in Nebraska during the study period, nearly half as many as were studie d); Mawhorr, supra note 42, at 6 (showing that 80% of pregnant inmates were excluded). 198 See Carlson, supra note 47, at 21 (noting that during the ten- year period studied in Nebraska, \"65 women successfully completed the nursery program . . . [and] [t]hirty -eight other women entered the progr am but did not complete it\"). 199 See, e.g. , Kusmer, supra note 30 (quoting an inmate as saying, about being with her son in a prison nursery, \"When he's with me, I really don't feel like I'm incarcerated\"). 200 Mawhorr, supra note 42, at 27. 2014] JAILING BLACK BABIES 505 Moreover, as explained above, returning to prison is only one reason why mothers separate from children. Another is r evert ing to substance abuse. Resuming or forming relationships with men who do not want the children around or pose a danger to the children is another likely cause. Published rese arch confirms a very high rate of ultimate mother -child separation suffered by prison babies.201 Further, remaining in maternal custody does not necessarily mean living in a safe and nurturing environment. The rate of documented maltreatment is high among parents with criminal histor ies, and there is much developmental deprivation that never leads to an agency or court finding of maltreatment. 202 5. Prison as O rigin and I dentity for Black C hildren Finally, advocates for prison nurseries and extended visitati on also ignore other potential negative effects on children. They fail to consider the normalization of the prison environment for these children, who are already at heightened risk of calling a prison their home when they are adults, and the stigmatizing effect of forever having to call a prison \"my first home\" or \"where I am from.\" Yet that concern is apparent to many other people. For example, in refusing to order that a child go to a prison for visitation with a father, a trial court judge in Oregon sta ted the following : [W]hat would be the impact on this child of growing up being exposed to that situation, and being reminded through life that this is his origin? I think it almost goes without saying that it would be devastating to the child. I don' t think there 's any way that we can say it would be in his best interest, but I think it can be almost automatically said that it would be horrendously against this child 's best interest to grow up with that. 203 There is at least anecdotal direct support for th e judge's concern about normalization and stigma. One woman who began life in a federal prison wrote about her life thereafter: 201 See Byrne et al., supra note 151, at 83 (finding that three years after reentry only 44% of mothers who participated in New York's nursery program had custody of their children ); Goshin & Byrne, supra note 35, at 278 (noting a study finding that among women exiting Nebraska's prison nursery, \"only 57% retained custody of their children post release\"). 202 See Failinger, supra note 83, at 500; Raeder, supra note 78, at 25 (\"[O]ne third of national maltreatment complaints regarding children in in -home settings were made against caregivers who had been previously arrested.\"). 203 Harris v. Burns, 904 P.2d 648, 649 (Or. Ct. App. 1995) (upholding order of paternity and denial of visitation). 506 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 I was a girl, a teen, and a woman on edge for all of my life until recently. I found it next to impossible to reconcile my root s, for I've never met a peer with a story quite like mine. . . . Inmates are an outcast class, by design cast out of society, so without the right support, it's natural for a child born inside to end up feeling outcast as well. 204 Ample indirect support comes from the well -documented phenomenon of children who grow up in the community suffering from feeling stigmatized if they have a parent in prison.205 And it is plausible to suppose that the internalization of a prison identity and the shame that prison babies later experience increases with the more time they spend in prison, as this would make their parents' incarceration more prominent in their minds and in their sense of self. Of particular importance to the cause of race equality, these concerns about normalization and internalization must be especially pronounced with children of color, who constitute the majority of children whose mothers are incarcerated. Some women's advocates cite the disproportionate percentage of female inmates who are of minori ty race, as illustrating the social injustice at the root of the growing prison population.206 What th ose advocates fail to recognize is that any adverse effects on children from tying them permanently to incarcerated parents and making them live in prison during early formative years are going to fall disproportionately on children of minority race. We ought to exercise much greater caution ; we ought to think through the consequences much more thoroughly \u2014 taking into account the complex realities of prison l ife, children's developmental needs and lived experience , as well as the tremendous obstacles to successful reentry \u2014before we put black babies in prison, where they might develop an image of themselves as persons who belong behind bars. 204 Stein, supra note 169. 205 See BRAMAN , supra note 73, at 60 -61 (describing a young girl's difficulty with friends and in school because of her father's incarceration); Murray & Murray, supra note 72, at 294 (\"Incarceration is highly stigmatizing, and this stigma appears to be 'sticky,' spreading and adhering to family members, including the children of prisoners.

Advocacy and the Abuse of Social Science Research The preceding s ection demonstrates that there are substantial reasons to believe the ideal motivating creation of prison nurseries\u2014namely, that newborn children will securely attach to their birth mothers, will remain with their mothers for the remainder of their childhood, and will live a healthy and happy life \u2014is actually highly unlikely to be realized for children placed in prison nurseries. Instead, most seem destined for attachment failure, separation from their mothers, maltreatment, and long -term mental health problems. Recently published research on New York's prison nurseries substantiates these reasons for fear of bad outcomes for prison babies. I devote a subsection to that research because it provides an obje ct lesson in how advocates can misuse social science and how readily policy makers and legislators can be duped if there is no pushback from another constituency, which is especially likely with policy choices harmful to children. A group at the Columbia University School of Nursing, led by Dr. Mary Byrne, conducted a study of one hundred children who entered the prison nurseries at maximum -security Bedford Hills and neighboring medium -security Taconic Correctional Facility during a three -year period. Byrn e's group at Columbia has for many years been providing clinical services to the incarcerated mothers in these programs. 207 Although the expectation of objectivity in social science research is ordinarily incompatible with studying the benefits of a program in which researchers have a vested interest208\u2014in particular, an interest in demonstrating 207 See Byrne, et al., supra note 39, at 379 (\"[This] intervention consisted of weekly visits by a Nurse Practitioner . . . incorporating anticipatory guidance rega rding infant development, responsive parenting, maternal life goals, and maternal coping with reentry issues using . . . interactive communication responsive to mothers' expressed concerns\" as well as feedback to the mothers on their interactions with thei r children.); id. at 387 (\"[O]ur NP interventionists provided individualized visits and follow -up contacts with tailored content focusing on specific moments of maternal -infant behavior, fostering each mother's sensitivity to infant development, and encour aging reflective narration about the child as a unique person.\"); see also id. at 388 (conceding that her research could not distinguish any positive effects of her team's therapeutic intervention from effects of the prison nursery per se). 208 See Karen A. Jordan, Financial Conflicts of Interest in Human Subjects Research: Proposals for a More Effective Regulatory Scheme , 60 WASH. & LEE L. REV. 15, 36 (2003). Indeed, when the study involves human subjects, and in particular child subjects who are incapable o f giving consent and for whom the researchers' conclusions could have life-altering consequences, this self -interest of the researchers raises grave ethical concerns. See id. ; see also 45 CFR \u00a7 46.111(b) (requiring additional protection for the rights and welfare of human subjects who are children or other nonautonomous persons). Relying on consent from the children's mothers only exacerbates the concern in this context because the mothers also have a conflict of interests with the children, standing to benefit personally from a positive report about the program; Doriane Lambelet Coleman, The Legal Ethics of Pediatric Research , 57 D UKE L.J. 517, 517- 18 (2007) (noting that 508 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 success in order to secure continued financial and institutional support for the program209\u2014the Columbia study is widely cited in support of prison nurseries.210 In a firs t round of study, Byrne's team looked for indications that, upon reaching one year of age, babies who had been or still were in the prison were forming attachment s with their mothers. The mothers had many of the characteristics noted above for the female inmate population generally, such as high rates of substance abuse, prior criminal histories, and having left older offspring behind when enter ing prison.211 Althoug h the research began with one hundred babies, the team reported results for only thirty .212 The team's research report mostly avoids discussing the \"parental consent is central to the research community's claims about child protection\" in use of children as research subjects). 209 See Patricia C. Kuszler, Curing Conflicts of Interest in Clinical Research: Impossible Dreams and Harsh Realities , 8 WIDENER L. SYMP. J. 115, 141 (2001) (\"The FDA has had regulations in place since 1998 requiring investigators to have no financial interests in the product and technologies they are testing.\"). Columbia University had an institutional conflict of interest given that it benef its from grant money supporting clinical experiences for its students, like the School of Nursing's program at Bedford Hills, so any approval it gave for this human subject research would be suspect. See Mark Barnes & Patrik S. Florencio, Financial Conflic ts of Interest in Human Subjects Research: The Problem of Institutional Conflicts , 30 J.L. MED. & ETHICS 390, 393- 94 (2002) (stating that there is an \"assumption that institutional conflicts can influence researchers and institutional decision makers, incl uding IRB members, IRB staff, and others employed by the institution. . . . The risk is that their professional judgment may be affected by institutional pressure to achieve a research end point that is favorable to the institution's reputation or financia l interests.\"). The investigators did employ \"blind coders\" for the attachment assessments. Films of mother -child interactions were given to outside assessors without informing them of the research setting or hypotheses. See Byrne, et al., supra note 39, at 381. That gives some reason for viewing the attachment observations themselves, as opposed to the report based on them, as unbiased. However, one way a conflict of interests manifests is with \"improper data manipulation.\" See Barnes & Florencio, supra , at 394. Moreover, one might want to know, whether the coders could figure out from the films or from the fact of being contacted by the Columbia tea m that the mothers and infants were in a therapeutic prison program operated by that team. The coding entails subjective judgments from observations of infants' behavior. 210 See, e.g., Susan Conova, Do Babies Belong in Prison?, NURSING RES. (Columbia U. Med . Ctr., New York, N.Y.), Feb./Mar. 2006, http://www.cumc.columbia.edu/nursing/p df/InVivoByrne.pdf (\"The project will have a big impact on the future of these nurseries. . . .

Figuring out what happened to them requires piecing together bits of infor mation scattered throughout the team's publications. The team conducted attachment assessments for an additional twelve children (forty -two altogether)213 yet nowhere reported what they found with those other twelve . The explanations given for excluding those twelve suggest the results were poor.214 Among the remaining fifty -eight infants, at least twenty -two experienced disruption of their relationship with their mothers while they were still in prison, because of disciplinary action or the mother's choices, presumably before their first birthday (when the attachment assessment would have been done).215 Those twenty -two children who experienced disruption include fourteen whom prison authorities ejected from the nursery unit, causing an immediate and possibly traumatic separation of infant from mother.216 The twenty -two also include three who separated from their mothers because the mothers decided after a while in the program that they did not want to continue and returned to the general prison population, and another five mothers who elected to transfer to a \"boot camp drug treatment.\"217 Presumably, t hese twenty -two babies were abruptly transferred to 213 Id. 214 The ostensible reasons for excluding them were (1) that for some there was no corresponding assessment of the mother's own attachment status vis -\u00e0-vis her parents, and the team wanted to compar e each baby's attachment status with that of his or her mother, and (2) that the child was no longer with the mother at the time of assessment. Id. at 379, 388. But neither of those explanations suffices as justification for concealing the results for this significant number of children for whom attachment was assessed, especially given the broad claims Byrne ultimately made about positive outcomes for children from spending time in the prisons. See infra notes 232, 258-265 and accompanying text. Further, both reasons raise suspicion that the success rate was poor for those children; whatever gives rise to a mother not completing an assessment herself could be p roblematic for attachment, and being separated from the mother obviously presents a problem for becoming attached to her. The Author asked Byrne by email what the secure attachment rate was for these twelve, but she declined to respond. 215 See Byrne et al., supra note 39, at 379 (noting that of one hundred dyads, forty -two were given assessments, leaving fifty -eight unassessed); Byrne et al., supra note 151, at 83-84, 86 (noting that three mothers were separated by maternal request, five mothers were separated due to the mother's choice to tran sfer to boot camp drug treatment options, and the New York Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (\"DOCCS\") separated fourteen mothers for disciplinary reasons). It is actually unclear whether all of these twenty- two were among the fifty -eight who never had an attachment assessment; the twelve assessments on which the team did not report included some children who had separated from their mothers. Compare Byrne et al., supra note 39, at 379 (noting that of one hundred dyads, forty -two were given assessments, leaving fifty- eight unassessed), with Byrne et al., supra note 151, at 83 -84 (noting that a total of twenty -two mothers were separated because of disciplinary action or the mother's choices, but not whether they had been assessed). 216 Byrne et al., supra note 151, at 84, 86. 217 Id. at 83 -84. A study of Ohio's prison nursery similarly showed that nearly 20% of women who entered the nursery were either ej ected or chose to exit from it before their 510 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 someone in the outside community, likely someone with whom they had little or no prior contact and for whom care of the infant was a substantial burden.218 For these twenty -two children who were suddenly separated from their birth mothers, it seems reasonable to suppose that the rate of secure attachment to the birth mother was near zero.219 In addition, one baby died after contracting a respiratory infection in the prison.220 Thus, the team actually knew or could readily infer the attachment outcomes for as many as sixty -five infants ( forty -two for whom attachment was assessed plus twenty -three who separated from the birth mother before the first birthday) on their first birthday, but nevertheless reported and drew policy conclusions on the basis of results for only thirty infants.221 For the additional thirty -five, the rate of secure attachment to birth mother was likely close to zero. The fate of the remaining infants (those no t assessed but not removed from the program while the mother was still incarcerated) is difficult to discern from the study reports. Some (the researchers do not reveal how many) left with their mothers before their first birthday but were separated from t he mothers soon thereafter, and for them the rate of secure attachment to birth mother was likely also zero or close to zero , because of that separation.222 Five mothers were deported at the end of their prison sentence s, and it appears that only two of thei r babies left the country with them at that time, so three of these mothers separated from their children, possibly permanently. 223 An additional undisclosed number of infants could not be assessed because they had not yet progressed to the stage of physical development at which it is possible to do an attachment assessment.224 release dates, causing their babies to experience a disruption.

Even among those infants who were still with their mother in the community on their first birthday, and for whom Byrne's team did report attachment results, most did not form a secure attachment to the mother. See Byrne et al., supra note 39, at 379, 382 (reporting that only six out of fourteen infants in this subcategory showed signs of secure attachment). 223 Byrne et al. , supra note 151, at 84. 224 Email from Mary Woods Byrne, Professor, Columbia University, Dir., Ctr. for Children and Families, to author (Feb. 27, 2012) (on file with Author) (stating that independent mobility is a developmental prerequisite for conducting the Strange Situation 2014] JAILING BLACK BABIES 511 The team did not reveal the number of children for which that was true, nor did they discuss whether the slower rate of physical development in these children might itself suggest something negative about the babies' well -being s, such as deficient maternal nurturing or a dverse impact s of the prison environment. For an additional , unspecified number of infants who exited the prison with their mothers before reaching age one, the team lost contact with the mothers or the mothers lived too far away from the lab where the team was conducting the attachment assessments. 225 The team received reports that some of these mothers had separated from their children or were again engaged in crimina l activity that could lead them back to prison.226 Thus, perhaps the most interesting part of the Bedford Hills story, and the most revealing of the true odds of a good outcome for a baby the state places in prison, is the fate of the seventy children whom t he team chose not to discuss in their report on attachment. As stated above, what policy makers should want to know is the answer to this : What is the likelihood, for any given newborn child of an incarcerated woman, that if the state puts that baby into p rison he or she will form a secure attachment to the mother and will not suffer separation from the mother thereafter (and will not be harmed by the experience of living in prison) ? Both failing to form a secure attachment in the first place and experiencing a disruption or destruction of the attachment relationship after it forms or begins to form are seriously detrimental to a child and likely to put the child on a downward traject ory in life. 227 Among the thirty children on whom the team chose to focus for attachment purposes, they observed indications of attachment forming in eighteen babies, so they did document that attachment might be achievable in a prison environment.228 Attachme nt \"might be\" achievable because the one- year point is early in the attachment stage of development, which is \"fragile,\" lengthy, and dependent on \"contextual stability in the early years of life.\"229 Subsequent adverse experiences, to which these children a re highly vulnerable, could easily derail the attachment process.230 In fact , some of those eighteen were separated from their mothers Procedure (\"SSP\"), so infants that had not reached that level of development were excluded). 225 Byrne et al. , supra note 151, at 83 -85. 226 Id. at 82 (not ing that the researchers received reports of \"longer term separation patterns\" among these women); Goshin & Byrne, supra note 118, at 97, 98, 102 ( reporting researchers' belief that some mothers avoided contact because they were again involved in criminal activity). 227 See supra notes 164-165 and accompanying text. 228 Byrne et al., supra note 39, at 382, 384 (noting that there were indications of secure attachment for 60% of the thirty children, totaling eighteen). 229 Id. at 389 -90. 230 See Inge Bretherton, Parental Incarceration: The Challenges for Attachment Researchers , 12 A TTACHMENT & HUMAN DEV. 417, 421 (2010) (\"One might conclude [from Byrne's study] that the year- long in -prison intervention experience interrupted the 512 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 immediately after the assessment , because of New York's one- year timeline for a baby 's stay in prison.231 Despite these reasons for hesitation, and despite the omission of seventy out of the original one hundred children, Byrne concluded, based on the eighteen -out- of-thirty finding, that her study \"demonstrates that children raised in a prison nursery program exhibit measurable rates of secure attachment consistent with or exceeding population norms.\"232 In other words, she claim ed that prison babies on the whole do just as well in terms of attachment rate as babies who do not live in prisons, a claim that my deconstruction of the study above shows to be false. Byrne did add several caveats\u2014 namely, that thirty is a small sample,233 that testing conditions were constraining,234 that the attachment process might not continue to go well after the team's support services ended235 or when chi ldren returned to the mother's community of origin with its \"multitude of environmental risks,\"236 that the high risk of mother -child separations was cause for serious concern,237 and that the attachments observed might not have occurred without the research team's therapeutic involvement with the mothers. 238 But advocates for prison nurseries predictably have ignored these cautionary notes and have routinely made sweeping statements to the effect that this study proves prison nurseries are good for children. 239 State commissions appointed to assess the policy desirability of prison cycle of intergenerational transmission for many babies with AA I-insecure [Adult Attachment Interview -insecure] mothers but (given the small sample involved) I have reservations about making such claims before confirmatory follow -up results from this longitudinal study become available.\"); Murray & Murray, supra note 72, at 292 (\"Importantly, there is evidence that attachment quality can change over time in response to changes in the caregiving environment, wit h, for example, secure children later becoming insecure in response to new family adversities.\"). 231 See supra notes 166-168. 232 Goshin & Byrne, supra note 35, at 280. 233 Byrne et al., supra note 39, at 388. 234 Id. at 388 -89. 235 Id. at 389. 236 Id. at 390. 237 Id. at 389. 238 Id. at 387 -88; see also Bretherton, supra note 230, at 422 (hypothesizing \"that the weekly one -on-one interactions with the nurse practitioner who functioned as a therapeutic secure base may hav e been the most efficacious aspect of the Bedford Hills intervention\"). 239 See, e.g. , DIAMOND & ORWISH -GROSS , supra note 81, at 4 (claiming that Byrne's study showed that \"71% of infants who lived with their mothers in a prison nursery, developed secure attachment\"); Sarah Abramowicz, A Family Law Perspective on P arental Incarceration, 50 F AM.

Adding to the calculations of attachment rate the twenty -two babies241 who separated from their mothers while in prison before age one ( fourteen because pr ison officials ejected the mother, eight because the mothers chose to exit), who undoubtedly did not form a secure attachment to their birth mothers, changes the rate of secure attachment to 3 5% (eighteen out of fifty -two), which is similar to the poor rat es of secure attachment for infants in the community whose mothers are incarcerated.242 Taking into account also that some of those eighteen who showed signs of secure attachment suffered separation from their mothers immediately after the assessment ,243 that many more infants left prison with their mothers but separated soon thereafter , and that the results were likely poor for the twelve additional babies who were assessed but excluded from the calculations, the rate of secure attachment among the one hundred babies originally enrolled in the study must actually be well below even the very poor rate for children who remain in the community while their mothers are in prison. And that is what policy makers should want to know. Moreover, even for the small percentage of prison babies who do develop secure attachment s to their mothers, the long -term prospects would be poor. The enormous challenges facing the mothers on reentry create a high likelihood of maltreatment and disruption of the attachment relation ship. 244 Follow -up research research \"indicates that these programs benefit mothers and children\"); Kusmer, supra note 30 (\"[S]tudies show the children benefit from the contact, said Mary Byrne . . . .

The team found at three years after reentry that only twenty - four of the original one hundred children had remained continuously in the care of their mothers246 and that most of the children were not in their mother's custody at that point . 247 What explains this high rate of separation? In addition to the twenty -two children who were separated from their mothers while in prison because of disciplinary action or the mothers' choice, a s well as the ten who were separated immediately upon turning one because their mothers had more than six months left to serve, many others experienced separation from their mothers even though they left prison at the same time as their mothers. Some separations were temporary, but even those can be traumatic and disrupt a child's psycho -emotional development .248 Others were prolonged and possibly permanent. At least eighteen mothers returned to prison because of criminal recidivism,249 and an unspecified number had drug relapses after release.250 Moreover, even among the forty -four women who were primary caretakers of their children at three years after reentry, 251 undoubtedly some subsequently separated from the children\u2014 the team learned that some of them were involved in criminal activity, substance abuse, or other parole violations.252 Even among the 24% of children who remained continuously with their mothers through the three -year mark after reentry, the rate of secure attachment was likely around half.253 Thus, judging from this one longitudinal study of one crime.\"); Roberts, supra note 19, at 1499 (\"[T]he post -prison collateral penalties make it difficult [for released mothers] to maintain a relationship with their children.\" ). 245 Byrne et al., supra note 151, at 87. 246 Of these twenty- four children, eight were separated from their mothers for periods of time.

See id. 253 The team did not conduct attachment assessments in the follow -up studies nor report what overlap there was between the attachment assessments at the one -year mark and the twenty- four children who remained continuously with their mothers, so one can only m ake a reasonable estimate based on other information. These twenty -four children would not have included the ten who were still with their mothers and in prison on their first birthdays but who then had to leave the prison while their mothers stayed behind . It might include the other six children who were still in prison on their first birthdays, and for 2014] JAILING BLACK BABIES 515 hundred prison babies, conducted by a team that had attitudinal and institutional motivations to find positive results, the percentage of mother -child relationships that fulfill the ideal envisioned by prison nursery proponents (secure attachment and continuous maternal care thereafter) appears to be 10 to 15%. The conclusion Byrne's research actually, objectively yields, then, is this: i t is possible for the prison nursery ideal to be realized, but it is very unlikely, and for the great majority of babies whom states are putting in prisons, the ultimate outcome will entail attachment failure or disruption ; separation from the mothers ; and, consequently, later lives marred by the same dysfunctions their mothers had. It is difficult to understand w hy the high rate of separation is not the main story the research team tells and why it does not lead Byrne and her team to advise against continuation of this experiment with children's lives unless and until states figure out how to prevent separations. Byrne herself writes, The overwhelming conclusion of existing research in psychology, psychiatry, and child development is that abrupt separation from a primary caregiver before 18 months of age has lifelong effects on a person 's ability to establish heal thy relationships and interact in a positive way with the world. . . . Children who are separated from their primary caregivers during this period learn that they cannot depend on others to care for them and that the world is an unpredictable and frighteni ng place. It is well established that frightening experiences early in life can lead to disorganization even in an established attachment. Neurochemical studies show that disruptions to the attachment process affect the growth and development of the brain, as well as social functioning, aggressiveness, reaction to stress, and risk for substance abuse during adulthood.254 Byrne's published reports of her research could give readers the impression that she approached her studies as an advocate for women prisoners and prison nurseries rather than as a disinterested social scientist.255 Despite her acknow - them we might reasonably assume four were securely attached. The remaining eighteen children who continuously lived with their mothers from birth to three years after reentry most likely left with their mothers before reaching age one. Among the fourteen children in that category for whom the team reported results, only six showed signs of secure attachment, a rate of 43%. Extrapolating from the fourteen to the eighteen, 43% of 18 is 7.7, so let us assume eight children. Eight and four make twelve, or half of the twenty -four. Without more complete disclosure from the research team, it is not possible to confirm the accuracy of this estimate. 254 Byrne et al., s upra note 151, at 86 -87 (citations omitted). 255 By \"advocate for,\" I do not mean occupy a role designated for advocacy, but rather simply someone wh o advocates for. It is worth noting, though, that one of Byrne's official roles has been supervisor of the clinical program at Columbia University School of Nursing 516 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 ledgement that the recidivism studies are \"specious,\"256 she frequently suggests to readers that policy makers should support prison nurseries because they reduce recidivism.257 And despite her own numerous cautions about interpreting the attachment results that she chose to report, Byrne frequently makes sweepingly positive assertions about the research in a way that appears designed to convince readers of the desirability of putting babies in prison: \"Evidence that secure attachment actually does occur in US prison nursery settings provides a strong argument for their effectiveness\" and \"these programs are effective for the women and ch ild participants and are reasonably efficient, but provide access to a small number of those in need. Limited access is a constraint to the potential widespread effectiveness of this policy solution.\"258 A reasonable reader could conclude from these assertio ns that all or nearly all children in prison nurseries realize \"positive developmental outcomes\" and do so because of the prison nurseries,259 yet that is patently false.260 through which her students provide services to the inmate mothers.

Byrne also makes misleading statements about the law governing the prison program, falsely suggesting that courts have ordered prison officials not to place a child in prison unless and until they conclude that doing so is in that particular child's best interests. See Byrne et al., supra note 151, at 81 (\"[T]he 'best 2014] JAILING BLACK BABIES 517 A more objective conclusion from this one study that has been done on the child welfar e impact of prison nurseries in the U nited States is this: imprisoning babies with their mothers is a reckless gamble that harms the great majority of them by tethering the children psycho- emotionally to women who are not capable of giving a baby the nurturing needed for secure attachment or serving as consistent long -term caregivers. For the great majority of children, the programs are a failure likely to cause lifelong adverse consequences. What is most disheartening from a child welfare perspective is how advocates downplay or simply ignore this reality , determined to continue the practice for the sake of the adults whose suffering appears to be their primary concern. IV. LEGAL LIMITATIONS ON THE PLACEMENT OF CHILDREN IN PRISON Part II showed that prison is not a healthy environment for children; it is highly unlikely children will attach to their incarcerated mothers even when forced to live with them in prison; if attachment with an incarcerated mother does occur , there is great risk it will be d isrupted; and immediately placing babies born to interest of the child' standard applied to community custody cases must also be used to determine whether a pregnant inmate could keep her child . . . . [C]orrectional authorities are duty [the best interest] standard when making decisions.\"). In fact, the court decisions she cited to support these assertions (1 ) were local court decisions governing only counties that do not include Bedford Hills, and (2) simply held that incarcerated mothers can challenge an exclusion of their child from the program on the grounds that prison officials failed to consider whether placement in the prison might be consistent with the child's welfare. See Bailey v. Lombard, 420 N.Y.S.2d 650 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1979) (holding that a sheriff did not abuse his discretion in declining, based on his assessment of the child's welfare, a mother' s request to have her baby placed in county jail with her); Apgar v. Beauter, 347 N.Y.S.2d 872 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1973) (holding that a sheriff improperly denied a jailed mother's request to place her baby in jail with her because he did not have sufficient re ason to believe this would be contrary to the child's welfare). 260 At other times, Byrne writes in somewhat more measured terms of attachment rates , but she still claims too much. She asserts that \"this study provides the first evidence that mothers in a pr ison nursery setting can raise infants who are securely attached to them at rates comparable to healthy community children.\" Byrne et al., supra note 39, at 375; see also Byrne et al., supra note 151, at 80 (characterizing the attachment success as \"striking\"). She claims that her research \"demonstrates that children raised in a prison nursery program exhibit measurable rates of secure at tachment consistent with or exceeding population norms.\" Goshin & Byrne, supra note 35, at 280. And she states that her study showed babies of \"im prisoned pregnant women\" achieved attachment \"at very high levels.\" Byrne et al., supra note 48, at 27. Her findings do not support even these assertions because they pertain only to a carefully culled subset of mothers and infants and only at an early point in the attachment stage of development. To assert that the rate of secure attachment with \"mothers in a prison nursery,\" with \"imprisoned pregna nt women,\" or for \"children raised in a prison nursery\" ultimately is that reflected in that subset at that point in time is grossly misleading at best. 518 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 inmates for adoption gives them a far better chance for a healthy and fulfilling life. Prison nurseries are therefore patently unjustifiable on child welfare grounds. Are they also unlawful? Remarkably, no one has asked this question before now. Scholars concerned about incarceration of parents routinely argue in favor of greater substantive and procedural protection for those parents as a matter of constitutional entitlement,261 but they have nothing to say about what rights the Constitution might confer on children in connection with the state 's placing them in prisons. This Part considers both constitutional and statutory limitations on placement of children in prisons. For thi s first -ever analysis of the question, it affords helpful simplicity to confine consideration to the extreme case of prison nurseries. This Part examine s the legality of this practice from two perspectives\u2014 first viewing it as a state decision to place babi es in prison and second as a state decision to authorize incarcerated parents to place their children into prison. Regardless of how one views the situation, for children to spend any amount of time in prison, there must be some state action that plays a causal role. At some point, some state officials \u2014whether prison wardens, department of corrections officials, social service agency employees, legislators, or governors\u2014must decide that it will happen and, accordingly, either transfer a child in state custo dy to a prison or confer on parents or other adults the legal power to bring children into prisons and keep or leave them there. Such government decision making must be subject to legal limits even if some private party also plays a role. Clearly, if the state said that children of inmates must live in the prison with them, we would recognize a potential constitutional violation. Likewise , if a state decided to put abandoned children into prisons to live with unrelated inmates at the request of those inmate s and in the hope that this would reduce recidivism, it would certainly be subject to legal challenge. And if legislatures authorized placement of mentally disabled adults in prisons to live with incarcerated relatives who so request, advocates for disabled persons would undoubtedly challenge its legality. A. May the State Place Infants in Prison? State placement of infants in prison can be viewed as analogous to a state decision to remove a free person from the community and sentence him to a prison term or civilly commit him to a secure psychiatric facility. This is so regardless of how much nicer a nursery unit is than the rest of the prison; if an entire prison were just like the nicest existing prison nursery, in terms of accommodations and decora tions, only without babies, no one would deny that it is still a prison. 262 And 261 See, e.g. , Caitlin Mitchell, Family Integrity and Incarcerated Parents: Bridging the Divide , 24 Y ALE J.

These limits arise from individuals' right to liberty and b odily integrity, and they have substantive and procedural aspects. After describing general constitutional limits and rights, this s ection considers whether these apply in the case of nonautonomous persons and, if so, whether the unique situation of parent al incarceration warrants creating a special exception to normal constitutional rules. Lastly, it addresses the implications of federal and state statutes that prohibit housing minors in adult prisons. 1. General Substantive and P rocedural C onstitutional Limits As a general matter, the state may not order individuals into detention facilities unless it has either ( a) charged them with a crime and determined on an individualized basis that they pose a flight risk or a danger to the community that can onl y be addressed by detention,263 or (b) found in an adversary hearing that they for some other reason pose a danger to themselves or others that makes detention necessary.264 \"In our society liberty is the norm, and detention prior to trial or without trial is the carefully limited exception.\"265 It is, in fact, \"the most elemental of liberty interests \u2014the interest in being free from physical detention by Industrial School. The fact of the matter is that, however euphemistic the title, a 'receivin g home' or an 'industrial school' for juveniles is an institution of confinement in which the child is incarcerated for a greater or lesser time. His world becomes 'a building with whitewashed walls, regimented routine and institutional hours' . . . people d by guards, custodians, state employees, and 'delinquents' confined with him for anything from waywardness to rape and homicide.\" (citations omitted)). 263 See, e.g. , United States v. Montalvo -Murillo, 495 U.S. 711, 720 (1990) (holding that a pretrial detainee may be confined to ensure his presence at trial or in \"recognition [of] the danger [such] a person may pose to others if released\" (quoting S. REP. NO. 98- 225, at 3)); United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 751 (1987) (holding the Bail Reform Act of 1 984 constitutional because it \"authorizes the detention prior to trial of arrestees charged with serious felonies who are found after an adversary hearing to pose a threat to the safety of individuals or to the community which no condition of release can dispel \" (emphasis added)). 264 See Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 426- 27 (1979) (holding \"that due process requires the state to justify confinement by proof more substantial than a mere preponderance of the evidence\"); see also Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U. S. 71, 81 (1992) (holding violative of due process a state statute authorizing detention of a person acquitted due to insanity, because under it such person was not \"entitled to an adversary hearing at which the State must prove by clear and convincing evi dence that he is demonstrably dangerous to the community\"); Jackson v.

Even the aim of protecting individuals from harm by other persons is insufficient justification for the state to seize persons and plac e them in prison. Thus, the state may not arrest and imprison victims of domestic violence to protect them from further abuse.269 Presumably , it would not be constitutionally permissible for the state to react to reports of pervasive abuse in nursing homes by ordering that elderly persons be housed in prisons instead, even though the state might better supervi se their treatment there. Children of incarcerated parents do not fall into either of the articulated exceptions to the general constitutional prohibitions against state confinement of persons in correctional facilities. They have committed no crime, and t hey do not pose a danger to themselves or others. Thus, prison nurseries presumptively violate those substantive prohibitions. The state is also subject to substantive constitutional limitations when it initiates a civil commitment action against mentally ill or mentally disabled persons ; \"[C]ivil commitment for any purpose constitutes a significant deprivation of liberty that requires due process protection.\" 270 The Supreme Court has established that mere deficiency of reason is not sufficient cause for comm itting a person to an institution.271 Even when a mental deficit is clear, \"there is still no constitutional basis for confining such persons involuntarily if they are dangerous to no one and can live safely in freedom.\"272 Thus, it is clearly insufficient und er civil commitment doctrine that a person might be better off if institutionalized: 266 Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507, 529 (2004). 267 Foucha, 504 U.S. at 90 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). 268 I do not consider Eighth Amendment doctrine because it applies only following a criminal conviction. Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 64 (1977) (\"An examination of the history of the Amendment and decisions of this Court construing the proscription again st cruel and usual punishment confirms that it was designed to protect those convicted of crimes.\"). Further, as a descriptive matter, placement of babies in prison nurseries cannot fairly be characterized as punishment. 269 My research assistants searched i n vain for reported instances of this occurring. 270 Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 425 (1979). 271 O'Connor v. Donaldson, 422 U.S. 563, 575 (1975) (\"'[M]ental illness' alone cannot justify a state's locking a person up against his will and keeping him inde finitely in simple custodial confinement.\"). 272 Id. 2014] JAILING BLACK BABIES 521 [T]o commit an individual to a mental institution in a civil proceeding, the State is required by the Due Process Clause to prove by clear and convincing evidence . . . that the person sought to be committed is mentally ill and that he requires hospitalization for his own welfare and the protection of others.273 Indeed, even if a mentally ill person has committed a crime but is found not guilty by reason of insanity, the s tate may confine him only so long as he poses a danger to others.274 That justification cannot plausibly be invoked to support state placement of infants in prison. Thus, even if civil commitment doctrine applied rather than doctrine relating to incarcerati on, prison nurseries presumptively violate children's substantive constitutional rights. In addition to substantive limitations on state placement of persons in detention facilities or psychiatric hospitals, there are constitutionally mandated procedural requirements. These are no minor detail; they are crucial for ensuring that state actors do not run roughshod over individuals' rights, especially those of vulnerable individuals who cannot complain, and that state decision making that impact s persons' bas ic welfare is rational and objective as well as respectful of rights. 275 First, such state action requires \"clear and unquestionable authority of law.\"276 Prison officials in Indiana, Nebraska, and Washington are violating this mandate by placing babies in pri sons despite the absence of any statute authorizing the practice. Second, the state action may occur only after a procedurally regular , individualized adjudication of its appropriateness.277 Ordinarily the state places someone in prison for a definite term , such as eighteen months or three years, only after finding that person committed a crime ; to do so, the state must conduct an 273 Foucha v.

It is the basic and essential term in the social compact which defines the rights of the individual and delimits the powers which the state may exercise. As Mr. Justice Frankfurter has said: 'The history of American freedom is, in no small measure, the history of procedure.' But in addition, the procedural rules which have been fashioned from the generality of due process are our best instruments for the distillation and evaluation of essential facts from the conflicting welter of data that life and our adversary methods present. It is these instruments of due process which enhance the possibility that truth will emerge from the confrontation of opposing versions and conflicting data.

Moreover, whereas a mother might be able to appeal a decision exclud ing her from the nursery, 280 there is no mechanism for appealing on behalf of the child a decision t o put him or her in prison; a prison warden's decision to put a baby in prison is unreviewable. States are placing children in prison for months or years without any formal and transparent process and without independent representation for the children\u2014an obvious violation of children's right to procedural due process. 281 That this processless incarceration is happening primarily to minority- race children makes it especially troubling.282 2. Do I nfants H ave \" Liberty\" I nterests? Doctrine establishing rights against confinement has developed in contexts involving persons capable of experiencing confinement as a deprivation, and the Supreme Court has predicated these rights largely on the individual interest in liberty. A pertinent question is whether infants h ave the capacity for that experience or have a sufficient liberty interest such that it is fitting to extend the doctrine to them. The Supreme Court has typically spoken in general terms of all persons having constitutionally protected interests in liberty , rather than in more limited terms of just autonomous persons having such an interest. For example, in Terry v. 278 See, e.g. , Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 671 -72 n.40 (1977) (\"[T]he State does not acquire the power to punish with which the Eighth Amendment is concerned until after it has secured a formal adjudication of guilt in accordance with due process of law.\"). 279 Foucha, 504 U.S. at 75 -76, 81. 280 See Haverty, supra note 52, at 3 (reporting a statement by a prison official at Bedford Hills that there is an appeals process for the mothers). 281 In some programs, there might be a committee that reviews each application that any woman submits, but the committee does not include a child welfare expert and is not addressed by an independent advocate for the child whose fate is being decided. See, e.g. , NEB. DEP'T OF CORR. SERVS ., supra note 40, at 3 (naming as decision makers the prison warden and a committee consisting of the assistant warden, a mental health staff person, a parenting program coordinator, and the substance abuse unit supervisor). 282 Cf. Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507, 530 (2004) (observing that \"an unchecked system of detention carries the potential to become a means for oppression\"). 2014] JAILING BLACK BABIES 523 Ohio ,283 the Court pronounced, \"No right is held more sacred, or is more carefully guarded, by the common law, than the right of every individual to the possession and control of his own person, free from all restraint or interference of others.\"284 In Hamdi v. Rumsfeld,285 the Court reaffirmed \"the fundamental nature of a citizen 's right to be free from involuntary confinement by his own government.\"286 In fact, the Court has explicitly extended substantive and procedural due process rights to children.287 However, the Court has also stated on occasion that it views minors' liberty interest s as weaker than th ose of adults, simply because children must alw ays be in someone's custody and are never fully in control of their own lives and persons anyway. In Schall v. Martin, 288 for example, the Court upheld a statute authorizing preadjudication detention of juveniles charged with delinquency, reasoning that although a \"juvenile 's countervailing interest in freedom from institutional restraints, even for the brief time involved here, is undoubtedly substantial as well . . . that interest must be qualified by the recognition that juveniles, unlike adults, are always in some form of custody. Children, by definition, are not assumed to have the capacity to take care of themselves.\" 289 Whatever truth this assertion has as to teenagers, it is even more t rue of infants; they are appropriately always in someone's custody. But as this passage suggests, the Court has not stated that any minors have no constitutionally protected liberty interest s at all; though more limited, minors' liberty interests are still \"substantial.\" Indeed, some Supreme Court Justices have taken the position that minors have liberty interest s equal to those of adults, interest s the state must justify infringing even when it places minors in a homelike setting. Concurring in Reno v. Flo res,290 which upheld a federal immigration policy of holding unaccompanied alien children in state custody pending deportation if no parent was available to assume custody, Justices O'Connor and Souter wrote the following : \"Freedom from bodily restraint has always been at the core of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause from arbitrary governmental 283 392 U.S. 1 (1968). 284 Id. at 9 (emphasis added) (quoting Union Pac.

A p erson 's core liberty interest s are also implicated when she is confined in a prison, a mental hospital, or some other form of custodial institution, even if the conditions of confinement are liberal. This is clear beyond cavil, at least where adults are co ncerned . . . . Children, too, have a core liberty interest in remaining free from institutional confinement. In this respect, a child' s constitutional \"[f]reedom from bodily restraint \" is no narrower than an adult 's. Beginning with In re Gault , 387 U.S. 1 (1967), we consistently have rejected the assertion that \" a child, unlike an adult, has a right not to liberty but decisive and unusual event. \" The consequences of an erroneous commitment decision are more tragic where children are involved. [C]hildhood is a particularly vulnerable time of life and children erroneously institutionalized during their formative years may bear the scars for the rest of their lives. \"291 Moreover, as an empirical matter, infants are unquestionably affected physically and psychologically by their environment and have interests threatened by imprisonment that are properly viewed as liberty interests. Recall the description of prison presented by child development experts, q uoted in Part II, which emphasized the 292 Babies undoubtedly experience prison differently than do adults or teenagers, but they likely also experience it as a confining and oppressive environment and are adversely affected by the authoritarian control, severely limited space shared with many people, regimentation, pervasive tension, and deprivation of innumerable ordinary experiences, including contact with men and most of the natural world.293 In fact, babies might incur greater harm from time in prison than do adults or teenagers, because infancy is a time of intense brain development, physical growth, and vulnera bility.294 The psychological, physical, 291 Id. at 315 -18 (O'Connor, J. and Souter, J., concurring) (citations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). 292 Jaff\u00e9 et al ., supra note 135, at 402- 04. 293 See Hindery, supra note 220 (relating a former prison mother's ambivalence about her son's stay with her in New York's program, citing the regimentation, spread of infectious diseases, and lack of normal infant experiences). 294 See Evelyn Wotherspoon et al., Neglected Infants in Family Court , 48 F AM. CT. REV. 505, 506 (2010). 2014] JAILING BLACK BABIES 525 social, and developmental interests babies have that are thwarted in a unique way by imprisonment are fairly characterized as liberty interests.295 Even if infants' liberty interests are deemed weaker than th ose of adul ts, there is reason to be just as protective of them \u2014namely, that infants are unable to object to unwarranted incursions. It is too easy for adults to use children instrumentally to serve adults' interests\u2014 in particular, when the child's legal parents have interests contrary to those of the child. The primary motivation prison officials have had for instituting prison nursery programs is one that might also lead them to institute pets-in-prison programs \u2014that is, the supposition that it has some positive rehabilitative effect on the prisoners, which might in turn benefit prison operators and the rest of society by reducing recidivism and therefore the prison population. 296 The primary motivation of prisoners' advocates, the initiating force behind these program s, is to alleviate prisoners' suffering, just as a pets- in-prison program might do. It is essential, if children and their liberty interests are to receive respect and protection, that courts review these programs rigorously and demand, at a minimum, befor e the state places any child in an adult prison, an individualized finding based on at least clear and convincing evidence that imprisonment is necessary to avoid danger of substantial harm to that child, taking into account all available alternatives to i mprisonment. A state, therefore , could not plausibly defend placement of babies in prison against constitutional challenge s by asserting that babies have no interest in liberty \u2014no interest in not being confined to a state correction facility. The relevant question is what state justification could suffice for infringing that liberty by placing a child in prison. The Supreme Court has held that some justifications that might not pertain or suffice with competent adults do so with minors \u2014in particular, patern alistic efforts to protect minors' welfare. The Schall Court cited the state's authority to protect dependent and vulnerable persons as adequate justification for brief pretrial detention , stating that \"if parental control falters, the State must play its part as parens patriae . In this respect, the juvenile 's liberty interest s may, in appropriate circumstances, be subordinated to the State 's 'parens patriae interest in preserving and promoting the welfare of the child.'\" 297 Certainly the state and private parties are justified in constraining the freedom of very young children in some ways just to promote their welfare, and they need not always demonstrate that this is necessary or the least restrictive means of benefiting t he child. Nevertheless, with prison nurseries, long- term imprisonment is at issue \u2014not a temporary detention pending a hearing, not residential placement in a home environment as with foster care or kin guardianship, and not compulsory school 295 Cf. Mendez v. Rutherford, 655 F. Supp. 115, 120 (N.D. Ill. 1986) (holding that a complaint on behalf of a three -year-old child stated a cognizable substantive due process claim for damages against a police department for trauma from watching officers beat her father). 296 See supra notes 79, 194 and accompanying text. 297 Schall v . Martin, 467 U.S. 253, 264- 65 (1984) (citations omitted). 526 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 attendance. Th e Schall Court emphasized that in the context of detention, even in a facility housing only minors, not just any paternalistic justification will do; the justification must be proportionate to the severe deprivation that confinement in a prison- like facili ty for any period of time constitutes for anyone.298 The justification the government relied on was not that the juvenile might simply derive benefits from pretrial detention, such as by receiving counseling, but that temporary detention was necessary to pre vent him from engaging in more criminal activity and thereby subjecting others and himself to danger of violence. 299 There was a danger -to-self-and-others rationale and a necessity, as well as alleged criminal conduct, consistent with doctrine on pretrial de tention of adults. Thus, any parens patriae justification for prison nurseries must be especially compelling. It must be far more than would be required to place a child in foster care, which is typically an imminent risk to a child's physical health or safety that is avoidable only by placing the child in state custody.300 And presumably it must be more than would be required to place a juvenile under house arrest , which is proof that the juvenile has committed a crim e and poses a danger to the community .301 It is not enough that a child might benefit in some ways. Prison is different. It is different for a teenager , and it is different for an infant. In any case, as explained in Part II, states simply do not have evidence of any benefits; in fact , the weight of evidence points to a conclusion that prison nurseries are more harmful than beneficial to children, even relative to the status quo, and a far worse alternative than placement for adoption.302 3. Does the Parent -Child Context W arrant a Speci al Exception? Prison nursery programs differ from the pretrial detention at issue in Schall and from the custodial retention of alien minors in Reno in that, with prison nurseries, a legal parent is waiting for the babies in the facility in which the stat e is placing the child. Incarceration of the child thus has the effect of uniting the child with a legal parent rather than separating the two; that is the whole purpose.

It has long gone without question that being sentenced to prison for committing a crime entails losing one's right to physical custody of children.305 The significance of the birth mother's presence in the prison could therefore only be a factor in applying the test articulated above. Advocates for prison nurseries might contend that children are in imminent danger of substantial harm precisely by virtue of separation from their mothers. They would prefer that incarcerated mothers be transferred to a more homelike setting in the community, but unless the state does that, they might argue, incarcerating babies is the only way to protect the babies' fundamental well -being. Given the str ong constitutional presumption in favor of liberty and nonincarceration, the burden of proof falls squarely on advocates for prison nurseries to make this case. Making the case would entail demonstrating that ( 1) children of incarcerated birth mothers incu r harm when they do not live in prison with the birth mothers; ( 2) living in prison with their mothers would avert harm; and ( 3) living in prison is the only way to avert harm. To demonstrate the first of these , advocates can and do point to the very poor outcomes for most children who live in the community while their mothers are in prison, much attributable to failure to form a secure attachment with any permanent parent figure. Pointing to statistics for a la rge population cannot suffice, however, to justify incarcerating the entire population. The state may not institutionalize everyone diagnosed with schizophrenia, for example, based on studies showing high self -harm rates for this population. Some children born to 303 See, e.g. , DeShaney v. Winnebago Cnty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 203 (1989) (justifying CPS's failure to remove an abused child by explaining that \"had they moved too soon to take custody of the son away from the father, they would likely have been met with charges of improperly intruding into the parent -child relationship, charges based on the same Due Process Clause that forms the basis for the present charge of failure to provide adequate protection\"). 304 See, e.g. , Overton v. Bazzetta, 539 U.S. 126, 131 (2003) (upholding restrictions on prison visitation with children; applying highly deferential rational b asis review; and stating, \"The very object of imprisonment is confinement.

There is variability in this population as to what the alternative to maternal custody is, at what time of life and for how long separation occurs, what caused the birth mother to be in prison, and other factors. Children's procedural due process right requires an individualized assessment. To demonstrate the second point, that imprisonment averts h arm, advocates would need to establish that prison babies generally have better outcomes \u2014that prison nurseries are effective in avoiding the harm supposed to befall this population of children in the community. As explained in Part II, they cannot show this. In fact, starting life in prison appears to be even worse for these children \u2014 because of the nature of prison life, because they experience the trauma of separating from their birth mothers after beginning the attachment process with them, because they end up in the same bad situations in the community after separating from their mothers, and because they will always view prison as their home of origin. To demonstrate the third proposition, that imprisonment is the only way to avert harm , advocates would need to satisfy a sort of \"least restrictive environment\" test, as the state must do when it places a juvenile charged with delinquency in a secure facility, civilly commits a mentally ill person, confers guardianship powers with respect to an elderly adul t with diminished capacity, or makes school placement decisions for children with disabilities.307 They would need to show not only that imprisonment with a birth mother is better for a baby than living in temporary care in the community, but also that no re asonably available alternative to incarceration would be at least as effective as incarceration in avoiding the supposed harm to the children. And this they clearly cannot do. The state could easily place children born to incarcerated women in good, perman ent homes where the children would be quite likely to have very good lives, far better than the prisons and their birth mothers can provide, by immediately placing them with adoptive parents. 306 See Delancy, 400 So. 2d at 1270 (upholding the exclusion of a child based on finding that placement with his grandmother would be better for him under a later -repealed Florida prison nursery statute, which required an individualized determination that placement of a child in prison was in his or her best interests). 307 See Cruz v.

That a child's biological parent is in prison is not a good reason from a child welfare perspective, let alone a compelling justification, for making the child live in prison too. 4. Statutory Limitations It was once common for states to place juveniles charged with crimes in the same prisons that housed adults charged or convicted of crimes.308 Based on a perception that this was harmful for juveniles, because the harsh atmosphere of adult prison was antithetical to the state's rehabilitative aims for juvenile detention and because adult inmates pose a danger to vulnerable youths, a national consensus emerged decades ago that (1) juveniles should be spared as much as possible from any detention in state institutions, and ( 2) when juveniles must be placed in a stat e facility, it must be entirely separate from facilities for adults , and the juveniles should have no contact with adult criminals.309 This consensus ultimately produced the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 ( the \"Act\").310 The Act impose s on states, as a condition for receiving federal money aimed at preventing delinquent youths from becoming lifelong criminals, a \"deinstitutionalization mandate.\" Under the Act, minors who have not broken any law but are \"dependent, neglected, or abused,\" as well as those who have committed only \"status offenses\" \u2014that is, violations of legal prohibitions applicable only to minors, such as curfew violations or truancy \u2014\"shall not be placed in secure detention facilities or secure correctional facilities.\"311 Juveniles who have committed crimes may be placed in a detention facility, but they may not be confined in any facility housing adult inmates or otherwise have any contact with adult inmates.312 The Act repeatedly expresses c ongressional intent that minors should never have any contact with incarcerated adults,313 and i t makes no distinction between male and female adult inmates. Consistent with the federal Act, states, including all those in which prison nurseries currently exist, have enacted laws and regulations to effectuate this deinstitutionalization mandate. 314 Many echoed the conclusions regarding youth 308 Douglas E.

Nebraska, for example, announced legislative findings that \"the incarceration of juveniles in adult jails, lockups, and correctional facilities is contrary to the best interests and well- being of juveniles and frequently inconsistent with state and federal law requiring intervention by the least restrictive method.\"315 Prison nurseries straightforwardly contravene the Act's prohibition on placement of children who have violated no law in secure facilities. They also violate the provision mandating that no juvenile be \"detained or confined\" in any adult prison or have any contact with adult inmates.316 Congress did not have prison nurseries in mind when it passed the Act, but the plain meaning of the Act's language makes it applicable to all children and thus to prison nurseries; it proscribes any state action by which children who have committed no crime are \"placed in secure detention facilities or secure correctional facilities\" or are \"detained or confined in any jail.\" 317 Moreover, prison nurseries present the same dangers to which the federal law was a reaction; babies in prison routinely interact with numerous adult criminals and therefore are at risk of physical or verbal attack and of being influenced in a way that makes them more likely to become criminals later in life. B. May the State Empower Parents to Place Children in Prisons? In defense of prison nurs eries, states might argue that they themselves do not place children in prisons but rather merely permit parents to place their children in prison.

The Act defines \"jail\" in a way that would include prisons. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5603(22) (2006). Because prison nurseries were not the target of the Act, the federal oversight agency might not take action against them. But most courts that have decided the question have concluded that the Act creates a private right of action. See CIVIL ACTIONS AGAINST STATE & LOCAL GOVERNMENT : ITS DIVISIONS , AGENCIES , AND OFFICERS \u00a7 7:23, Juvenile Justice Act (Jon L. Craig ed., 2d 1996); Horn by Parks v. Madison Cnty.

In nearly every case, the facility in question has been one for treatment of mental illness or disability. Obviously, with both prison nurseri es and civil commitment of minors, state action play s a determinative role; the state must create or accredit the facility, confer the power on a parent, approve the parent's choice, and transport the child to the facility. But in the civil commitment context, courts have found that the constitutionally protected authority of parents shapes the analysis of what rights the minors have. The leading case is Parham v. J.R .,318 in which children committed to a psychiatric hospital at their parents' request s claimed a constitutional right to greater protection against such commitment.319 The Supreme Court did not decide in Parham nor in any other case what substantive test must be met to confine a minor in such a facility at the request of a parent; t he Court has been called on only to assess the procedures involved.320 But the Court in Parham did affirm that children, like adults, have a constitutionally protected liberty interest against confinement, 321 and it suggested that the confinement must be necessary to serve the medical needs of the minor.322 Significantly, the Court assumed that children's interest in not being institutionalized is subverted not only by the physical restraint that confinement entails but also by any stigmatization that results from psychiat ric institutionalization . 323 Three Justices who partially dissented expressed the impact on children's protected interests more vividly: Commitment to a mental institution necessarily entails a \"massive curtailment of liberty\" and inevitably affects \"fundam ental rights.\" Persons incarcerated in mental hospitals are not only deprived of their physical liberty, they are also deprived of friends, family, and community. Institutionalized mental patients must live in unnatural surroundings under the continuous and detailed control of strangers. They are subject to intrusive treatment which, especially if unwarranted, 318 442 U.S. 584 (1979). 319 Id. at 588. 320 Id. at 587. 321 Id. at 600 (\"It is not disputed that a child, in common with adults, has a substantial liberty interest in not being confined unnecessarily for medical treatment and that the state's involvement in the commitment decision constitutes state action under the Fourteenth Amendment.\"). 322 See, e.g. , id. at 608 (stating that \"the decision should represent an independent judgment of what the child requires\"); id. at 617 (directing remand to determine \"whether every child in the appellee's class received an adequate, independent diagnosis of his emotional condition and need for confinement\"); id. at 618 (finding \"no evidence that the State, acting as guardian, attempted to admit any child for reasons unrelated to the child's need for treatment\"). 323 See id. at 601. 532 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 may violate their right to bodily integrity. . . . Furthermore, as the Court recognizes, persons confined in mental institutions are stigmatized as sick and abnormal during confinement and, in some cases, even after release. Because of these considerations, our cases have made clear that commitment to a mental hospital \"is a deprivation of liberty which the State cannot accomplish without due process of law.\" . . . . Indeed, it may well be argued that children are entitled to more protection than are adults. The consequences of an erroneous commitment decision are more tragic where children are involved. . . . [C]hildhood is a particularly vulnerable time of life and children erroneously institutionalized during their formative years may bear the scars for the rest of their lives. 324 All of these warnings about the threat to children's welfare also apply to prison nurseries. The Parham Court held that commitment pursuant to the Georgia law at issue did not violate minors' Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process rights, because the hospitals' procedures for admission were sufficient to guard against parents' illicit motivations or mistaken judgments, and it held that formal adversary hearings are not constitutionally mandatory.325 Crucially, the hospitals ' procedures ensured admission only after individualized review, independent of parents, by professionals with specialized training to determine the needs of each child, yielding a conclusion of medical necessity.326 Also important to the Court's analysis was an assumption that some deference to the average parent is appropriate, as parents generally are inclined and able to do what is bes t for their children and because adversary hearings would deter some parents from getting needed help for their child.327 But the Court affirmed that there must nevertheless be an independent, professional assessment of the child's needs.328 324 Id. at 626- 28 (Brennan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (citations omitted). 325 Id. at 612 -13. 326 Id. at 606 -07, 614 -16; see also Sec'y of Pu b.

No child is admitted without at least one and often more psychiatric examinations by an independent team of mental health professionals whose sole concern under the statute is whether the child needs and can benefit from institutional care.\"). 327 Parham , 442 U.S. at 602- 04. 328 Id. at 604 (\"[T]he child's rights and the nature of the commitment decision are such that parents cannot always have absolute and unreviewable discretion to decide whether to have a child institutionalized.\"); see also Colon v. Collaz o, 729 F.2d 32, 35 (1st 2014] JAILING BLACK BABIES 533 Such an assessment is absent from decisions to place babies in prison programs. In addition, procedural protections for children whose parents want to have them placed in prison should be much greater, because the Parham Court's crucial assumptions about parents' ability an d altruistic motivation cannot be made in this context, and because prison is a worse place to put children. Mothers in prison are not average parents but , rather , are a special subset whose severe deficiencies in ability to regulate their own lives belie any assumption about their ability to do what is best for a dependent child. Moreover, unless and until the state decides that a child will be placed in the mother's custody in prison, she does not possess the decision -making rights of legal custody for which normal parents in the community receive constitutional protection. Mothers in prison are also much more likely than the average parent to act for selfish reasons in deciding whether their child will be confined; incarcerated women can vastly improve their own personal situation practically and psychologically by moving from the general population to a nursery and having their babies imprisoned with them. Whereas one might assume a parent would petition to have a child placed in a psychiatric hospital only against inclination and after intense internal struggle, for a troubled woman in jail who just gave birth it seems safe to assume that her selfish reasons for wanting to keep the baby with her would easily overwhelm any thoughts she might have that the child would be better off living in the community with a relative or being adopted. Relatedly, the Parham Court's fear of deterring a parent from requesting needed help is simply inapplicable in this context. 329 Thus, even if one views the situation as one in which the state merely approves a parental request for institutionalization, rather than itself deciding to place a child in prison, the Parham decision and its rationale do not support a test for placement o f children in adult prisons that is less rigorous than that dictated by the incarceration and adult civil commitment doctrines analyzed above. Arguably the test should be more stringent, or placement of children in prison should be categorically impermissi ble, as the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act suggests it should be. 330 In any event, all existing nursery programs fail even the test for civil commitment, and they must therefore be terminated. In sum, regardless of how they are conceptualized, all extant prison nursery programs in the U nited States violate the substantive and procedural constitutional rights of children and contravene the command of federal legislation prohibiting housing of minors in adult prisons. Any legal challenge to the m by a representative for an imprisoned baby should result in immediate closure. Less clear is how a legal challenge could arise.

CHILDREN AS MEANS TO OTHERS ' ENDS Advocacy for children- in-prison programs comes from liberal supporters of incarcerated women. Conservatives jump on board when duped into believing that such programs reduce crime and therefore taxpayer expense of operating prisons. For both groups, support for bringing children into adult prisons comes without empirical support for claims that this is good for children and despite numerous reasons for believing it bad for children. It comes without rigorous examination of what little empirical study has been done of effects on children. It comes without consideration of whether children have legal rights precluding the states from putting them in prison. It comes with no mention of the alternative of adoption. And it comes with little dissent. The conclusion is inescapable that in this context, for nearly all who take an interest in incarcerated women, the welfare of children is subordinate to the aim of improving these women's lives or otherwise serving interests other than those of children. Consider one example in the legal academy. Professor Desiriee Kennedy has perhaps written more about this i ssue than any other law professor. Her depiction of incarcerated mothers reads like an indictment of them as parents. She writes , Incarcerated women are more likely to be . . . young, poor, less educated and largely unskilled. Mothers in prison are often dealing with addiction and report higher rates of substance abuse than incarcerated men. Incarcerated women are also more likely than imprisoned fathers to be struggling with mental health issues. Women in prison report significantly higher incidences of child abuse and domestic violence as compared to men. Typically, the available services are insufficient to meet the needs of these populations. . . . . . . [I]t is very likely that their crimes may be related to the stress of raising children, providing for their families, and merely may be trapped in a cycle of poverty, addiction, child and domestic abuse, and mental with a number of complicated and interrelated psychological and mental health problems that are impossible to address in the time periods prescribed by state and 332 On the legal rules for acquiring representative status for a child, see James G. Dwyer, The Children We Abandon: Religious Exemptions to Child Welfare and Education Laws as Denials of Equal Protection to Children of Religious Objectors , 74 N.C. L. REV. 1321, 1466- 74 (1996). 2014] JAILING BLACK BABIES 535 federal standards. Incarcerated women engage in high l evels of drug and alcohol use and frequently have histories of mental illness and . . may be more easily pulled into a pattern of \"intergenerational\" crime and are more likely to engage in ill egal activity. . . . . . . In fact, many come from communities that lack adequate housing, schools, jobs, and drug and alcohol treatment centers. The result is that these women may find it difficult to provide for basic needs and get the assistance they n eed to cope with the stresses of living at the margins of impoverished communities may have an even more difficult and stressful role in mothering their children . . . . Many of these women come from communities wh ich present greater challenges to mothering and caring for their children than many other mothers . For example, . . . \"[w]omen [in Harlem] spend an extraordinary amount of time escorting children, limiting their movement, and trying . . . to keep are incarcerated may be faced with trying to find housing and care for their children, may have drug and alcohol problems, or may have a host of other social and economic problems . . . . 333 A rational, child -centered response to this depiction would be that the state should find other parents for any newborn child of these women, taking into account that a newborn has no established relationship with the mother, is readily adoptable, and needs a healthy, stable, nurturing permanent caregiver in place within six months. Yet Kennedy concludes from the severe difficulties and dysfunctions of these women that the state should be more protective of their role as parents. She argues against termination of paren tal rights and in favor of more prison nurseries from a \"critical race feminist\" perspective, 334 arguing that TPR \"should be viewed as a gendered and political act with community- wide ramifications\"335 and should be opposed because it \"not only removes childre n from their communities but disempowers the mother whose only source of potential power or status may be as a mother, and disempowers communities by removing their youth.\"336 In this view, the child functions largely like a therapy 333 Kennedy, supra note 18, at 169 -200 (citations omitted). 334 Id. at 166. 335 Id. at 167. 336 Id. at 197; see also Roberts, supra note 19, at 1499- 50 (characterizing TPR as punishment of mothers) (\"An analysis of the intersection of prison and foster care in black women's lives shows how punishing black mothers is pivot al to the joint operation of systems that work together to maintain unjust social hierarchies in the United States.\"); 536 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 dog\u2014something the state c ould give to a deeply unhealthy person to try to help her heal\u2014not a person with rights of his own. The child also functions like a welfare benefit, a resource given to the poor in an effort to make their lives more tolerable.337 Many other law review articl es follow the same line of reasoning \u2014in particular, articles complaining about application of Adoption and Safe Families Act's 15/22 rule (requiring CPS to petition for TPR if a child has been in non- relative foster care for fifteen of the past twenty -two months) to incarcerated women whose children live outside prison. The authors maintain that this timeline is too short, that incarcerated mothers cannot be ready to take custody of their children within that time period, because they are in prison and face severe challenges after release.338 But whereas a rational child -centered response to this reality might be that the state should terminate parental rights immediately , rather than waiting twenty- two months , so that the children can achieve permanency with good caregivers sooner rather than later or never, these authors instead argue that incarceration should be treated as a reason for waivin g the deadline, giving incarcerated mothers much more time! 339 They hardly address t he consequences of that for the children; it is at most a superficial afterthought. For example, some rest on the point that after twenty -two months in foster care, a child i s hard to place for adoption.340 This is true, but it again begs the question why the state does not terminate rights twenty -two months earlier.341 If the state knows when a woman Vainik, supra note 12, at 676 (detailing severe problems in women's lives before they entered prison, but treating this only as reason for sympathy). 337 See Denise Johnston, Intervention , in CHILDREN OF INCARCERATED PARENTS , supra note 124, at 199, 206- 09 (arguing that it is unfair to minority -race women to deny those with child maltreatment histories the opportunity to have their babies enter prison to be with them). 338 See, e.g., Day, supra note 83, at 236- 38; Roberts, supra note 19, at 1495- 99; Ross, supra note 139, at 217 (\"[I]t is hard to imagine how a parent newly released from prison, without an apartment or a job, whose kin were not available to care for the boy when the parent was sentenced, will be able to handle the stresses of parenting a demanding child while seeking to adjust to life after prison.\"). 339 See, e.g. , ANNE HEMMETT STERN , BABIES BORN TO INCARCERATED MOTHERS 9 (2004); MARGOLIES & KRAFT -STOLAR , supra note 6, at -xii; Day, supra note 83, at 242; Roberts, supra note 19, at 1498 -99; Ross, supra note 139, at 226- 28. 340 See, e.g. , Ross, supra note 139, at 224. 341 It also overlooks the fa ct that if there is no better alternative permanency plan for a child, TPR will not occur. The 15/22 rule only requires a petition, not an order, for TPR. The petition requirement contains broad exceptions based on a best -interests showing \u2014 taking into acco unt prospects for adoption \u2014or on a child residing with relatives. In addition, courts are always precluded from ordering TPR unless they find it would be in the child's best interests, all things considered, including potential for adoption. As a legal matter, there is no such thing as a TPR that is bad for a child. See Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, Pub. L. No. 105- 89, 111 Stat. 2115, (\"The family court may order the termination of parenta l 2014] JAILING BLACK BABIES 537 enters prison that she cannot parent her child for the next year or longer , because she will be in prison, and if it knows she will require indefinite additional time after prison to establish a stable and healthy life before she can assume custody, why does it not sever the legal tie at the time the woman enters prison, at least as t o any infant children, so a court can quickly create an alternative permanency plan, such as adoption, that will enable the child to form an attachment to reliable permanent caregivers? To advocates for incarcerated women, it seems that possibility is unth inkable. If they gave serious attention to the well- being of children, scholars who bemoan the elevated rate of maternal incarceration would at least acknowledge that the best policy for a newborn might be different from the best policy for a ten- year-old. They would at least recognize as a pertinent question whether a policy truly designed to do what is best for children should draw a distinction between children who were in foster care even before their mothers went to prison, because their mothers abused or neglected them, and children who were in their mother's custody until she entered prison. But they contemplate no such distinctions. Their position is categorical and unbending : the state must preserve female prisoners' parental status no matter what. Insofar as they have succeeded in advancing their position, advocates for female convicts have caused children to start life in a prison and then suffer rupture of whatever relationship they establish there with their birth mothers, and they have caused ch ildren to linger endlessly in foster care, never achieving family permanence. Their position is thus causing black children to become deeply troubled black teens who, deep in their psyche, view prison as their home. Remarkably, no one has studied the long -term outcomes for these former prison babies. A thought experiment should make even clearer the adult -centered focus of advocates for children -in-prison programs and their inclination to protect adults first and worry about children later or not at all. Suppose Washington revised its laws so that three years was no longer just the maximum stay in prison nurseries but also the minimum. In other words, suppose it became a condition for participation that pregnant inmates agree, regardless of how much time r emains on their sentences , to remain in prison until their child's third birthday, so that the attachment process can fully run its course under close supervision. Additionally, mothers must agree to spend another two years subsequently in a halfway facili ty, with substantial restrictions on and close monitoring of their movements and activities, including their socializing, and with compulsory job training and mental health services. The state's aim would be to ensure that mothers who choose to deny their children the opportunity for adoption by healthy, well -functioning, rights upon a finding of one or more of the following grounds and a finding that termination is in the best interest of the child . . . . \" (emphasis of Child Servs., 959 N.E.2d 272, 275, 294 (Ind. App. 2011) (overturning T PR as to incarcerated parents because the state had not shown it would be in the child's best interests, despite the foster parents' desire to adopt the child). 538 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 nonincarcerated people in good communities remain with the child and stay drug- free in a safe environment at least until the child reaches school age. Thus, a woman scheduled for release f rom prison one year after giving birth would have to agree to an additional four years of confinement and supervision if she wants to keep her baby. Prison nursery advocates assert that the prison environment is not so bad for children and is in any case better than the neighborhoods the mothers came from. 342 None object that Washington's three years is too long for children to live in prison. Even proponents of the nurseries concede the high risk of separation and attachment disruption upon reentry. 343 So what response would they have to this hypothetical new policy? Would they endorse it as a promising strategy for improving outcomes for children, one that lower s the alarming rate of separation? Would they be receptive to an argument that this policy is also good for the mothers, as it mak es it more likely they will stay on a positive path in life? That is unimaginable. Undoubtedly, they would reject the policy ou tright simply because it is coercive and an additional incursion on women's liberty, and they would struggle to find some reason why it is actually not better for the children. What explains this implicit lexical prioritizing of adults' interests over children's welfare? Liberal advocates for incarcerated women would undoubtedly in many other contexts strongly support programs that are clearly aimed solely at improving child welfare, even at the cost of an increased tax burden, such as subsidized child care , Head Start, and free school lunches. But those are contexts in which there is no conflict of interests between children and parents. In the context of parental incarceration, in contrast, there clearly is a potential conflict of interests, because the ad ults at issue are predominantly among the most dysfunctional people in our society, the least able to care for a child. And they are in a place, adult prison, that has generated national legislation commanding that children never be housed in it. This cont ext clearly raises the question of whether the children should even be in a legal relationship with the adults, a negative answer to which would likely cause suffering to the adults. The conflict of interests between adults and children is plain. Yet the s trong inclination of liberals in particular is to deny that any conflict exists, develop a policy position that protects the adults' interests, and then endeavor mightily to explain why that position does not sacrifice the welfare of the children. In this respect, advocacy for prison nurseries epitomizes a broader phenomenon among scholars, advocates for historically subordinate groups, and people in general \u2014namely, to view the relationship between biological parents and children as unlike almost any other good in adults' lives , including adults' relationships with other adults . They view the relationship as unique in two ways \u2014first, as normatively different, insofar as it is something many believe adults are entitled to even in circumstances when they are entitled to almost 342 See supra notes 78, 85-86, 91,149 and accompanying text. 343 See, e.g. , Byrne et al., supra note 39, at 387. 2014] JAILING BLACK BABIES 539 nothing else, especially if the adults are viewed as victims of social injustice ;344 and s econd, as empirically different, insofar as children are viewed relative to their biological parents as something other than distinct persons, as if t hey are a part of biological mothers' very self , or objects of ownership rights.345 These untenable views explain why immediate placement of babies born to prison inmates in adoptive homes is never an option considered in the law, policy, and social science literature relating to female criminals, even though that option would provide nearly all of these babies with vastly better life prospects. In addition to denying that any conflict of interests exists between incarcerated women and their children, advocates for children- in-prison programs might point out that these women would not be incarcerated in the first place if the legal response to their problems were less punitive, if the communities from which the women came offered more opportunities for healthy and productive lives, if better treatment for addiction were available to these women, if the state did more to prevent domestic violence, and in general if life were more fair. All that counterfactual speculation might be true, but it is morally and legally irrelevant to what the state ought to do with a child whose mother is incarce rated in this far - from -perfect world that actually exists. It is fallacious to reason that if something would not happen in a better world then it should not happen in the actual world. Adults are entitled to make choices about their relationships based on real-world circumstances\u2014 for example, ending an intimate relationship with a woman because she goes into prison. Children are entitled to have the state mak e the best decision for them about their family relationships, based on real -world circumstances an d the options available to them, including adoption. 346 344 See ELIZABETH BARTHOLET , NOBODY 'S CHILDREN : ABUSE AND NEGLECT , FOSTER DRIFT, AND THE ADOPTION ALTERNATIVE 7 (1999) (discussing \"blood bias\" that causes state actors and others to attribute to biological parents rights to possession of their children even when it is harmful to them); Stone, supra note 129 (commenting that \"[s]o strong is the conviction that mothers have an inherent right to parent\"). Some former prison inmates in Canada were bold enough to file suit against the province of British Colum bia arguing that cancellation of a prison nursery program there in 2008, because of perceived dangers to the children from inmate fighting and drug use, violated the fundamental right of mothers to have their children with them. See id.; Vivian Luk, Suprem e Court hears case for Mother -Baby Program, GLOBE & MAIL, May 28, 2013, at S.1. 345 This view of parenthood is not as archaic as one might imagine. See Bailey v. Lombard, 420 N.Y.S.2d 650, 653 -54 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1979) (\"Cases in New York State, culminating in Bennett v. Jeffreys . . . have shown that a child is no longer considered as a chattel . . . .\" (citation omitted)). 346 See generally JAMES G. DWYER , THE RELATIONSHIP RIGHTS OF CHILDREN (2006) (analyzing what rights children should possess in connection wi th state decision making about their personal relationships). 540 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 VI. RECOMMENDATION To make clear what alternative legal regime this A rticle recommends, the following preliminary sketch is offered , limited here to the case of a newborn child: First, state laws should direct that when an incarcerated woman gives birth, prison officials must notify the local child protection agency, and that agency must conduct an assessment of the child's situation and develop a permanency plan recommendation for the child based on that assessment. That assessment would take into account the mother's history (including past parenting and pattern of intimate relationships); the mother's current mental and physical health (including substance abuse); the time remai ning on the mother's sentence; the prospects for the mother's successful reentry (taking into account family support, employability, plans for residence, rehabilitative progress, and need to assume custody of older children); and other possible permanent c aregivers (including the child's father, extended family members willing to adopt, and unrelated persons interested in adopting). Second, state laws should direct the child protection agency to initiate a juvenile court proceeding, and the court should order the permanency plan that is most consistent with the baby's long -term best interests, taking into account several factors: the agency's assessment and recommendation, the psychological benefit children gain when raised by their biological parents or at least by biologically -related persons, any evidence that the mother or other interested parties might present to the court, and potential adoptive placements. The mother should have legal representation, but so too should the child. Third, putting babies i n prison should never be an option. If the mother is expected to leave prison within six or seven months, and if the court -selected permanency plan is for her to raise the child, the baby should be placed with a CPS-approved temporary caregiver until the m other leaves prison. If the mother has significantly more than seven months remaining to serve, and if there is no community- based residential program to which the mother can move, then presumably the permanency plan should not be for the birth mother to occupy the role of primary caregiver. Lastly, under any scenario involving placement of the child with an alternative parent figure, the decision whether that entails TPR as to the mother should depend on the identity of the alternative parent figure (e.g., family member vs. stranger) and other considerations. The best outcome for a particular child born to a prison inmate might be for an aunt to adopt the child, so that the child's primary attachment figure has role security and the law can ensure that the birth mother and child have the opportunity to form a relationship with each other at some point. The foregoing is obviously not comprehensive, addressing every possible permutation and detail. The most important points include the following : (1) state actors whose normal function includes making assessments about and choices for children's welfare (i.e., CPS and juvenile courts, not prison officials) should be 2014] JAILING BLACK BABIES 541 making such assessments and choices for babies born to incarcerated women; (2) the state should never choose to put a baby in prison; and ( 3) the state should immediately find an alternative permanent primary caregiver for any newborn child whose mother will be in prison for a substantial portion of the attachment period or for other reasons is not the best choice for the role of long -term primary caregiver (despite the child -welfare presumption in favor of her as a biological parent). VII. CONCLUSION Children -in-prison programs reflect a commendable sympathy for the lifelong disadvantage and depr ivation that most prison inmates have suffered and a wish to transform their lives. But acting primarily on the basis of that sympathy and wish, rather than focusing realistically on what is truly best for children, is a moral and policy mistake. Available evidence suggests that the extreme form of connecting incarcerated birth parents with their offspring, prison nurseries, harms the great majority of those children, especially when the impact is compared to the life the children might have had if adopted immediately after birth. Advocacy for this practice depends on a pretense that there is no conflict of interest s between incarcerated women and their newborn offspring and on misuse of empirical studies. It is ultimately grounded in a normative commitment to giving lexical priority to the welfare or happiness of those women. State actors need to recognize that advocates for incarcerated women are not reliable sources of information about the child welfare impacts of any policy, and they need to seek that information elsewhere and make children's welfare the determinative criterion of their decisions. But this is likely to occur only when true advocates for children begin to take an interest in this quietly proliferating practice of putting children in prison. DEMOCRACY ENHANCEMENT IN CRIMINAL LAW AND PROCEDURE Janet Moore * There is a democracy deficit at the intersection of crime, race, and poverty. The causes and consequences of hyperincarceration disproportionately affect those least likely to mount an effective oppositional politics: poor people and people of color. This Article breaks new ground by arguing that the democracy deficit calls for a democracy- enhancing theory of criminal law and proc edure that modifies traditional justifications of retributivism and deterrence by prioritizing self- governance. Part I contextualizes the argument within cyclical retrenchments in movements for racial and economic justice. Part II sketches the contours of a democracy -enhancing theory. Parts III and IV turn that theoretical lens on a single jurisdiction, North Carolina, to map a previously unnoticed constellation of cutting -edge criminal justice reforms. Part III explains why those reforms were improbable. Part IV tests the democracy- enhancing effect of the reforms. Part V identifies some conditions that allowed reform to occur and occasionally survive counterattack. The Article concludes that those conditions privilege grasstops over grassroots advocacy, and highlights examples of direct action by low -income people and people of color as a vital component of a more broadly democratic foundation for criminal law and procedure. * \u00a9 2014 Janet Moore.

He did not notice the \"giant yellow X,\" the repair trucks, or the fleeing workers \"until it was too late to safely abort the landing.\" 1 The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) sanctioned the senator by ordering him to take remedial flying lessons.2 He shot back with Senate Bill 1335, \"The Pilot's Bill of Rights.\"3 Inhofe sought to check the government's \"power to take action against an individual.\"4 He explained that he never fully appreciated \"the feeling of desperation\" that adverse government action can inspire \"until it happened to me.\"5 He was troubled that \"pilots sometimes aren't given access to all the evidence that might help their case .\"6 He was shocked that \"it took me , a U.S. senator, four months to get the voice recording to prove I was right\" in defending against the FAA's accusations.7 Sixty -four cosponsoring senators quickly backed Inhofe's bill ,8 as did organizations comprising more than half a million \"single -issue people who fly airplanes.\"9 Even Indiana Jones joined the fight. Lobbying on this \"real justice issue,\" actor Harrison Ford decried agency treatment of private pilots as the sole exception to \"the standard that we face everywhere else for justice.\"10 The Pilot's Bill of Rights cures that injustice by requiring the FAA to r elease \"all relevant evidence\" to a targeted pilot before proceeding with any enforcement action. 11 The bill became law just thirteen months after Inhofe introduced 1 Joan Lowy, Inhofe Targets FAA After His Flying Is Faulted , WASH.

John Thompson shares Inhofe's interest in checking government power over the individual \u2014and in ensuring ac curacy and reliability in adjudications \u2014by mandating enforceable governmental discovery duties.13 Thompson was not ordered to take remedial flying lessons. He was sentenced to death. For fourteen of the eighteen years that he was incarcerated, Thompson spen t twenty -three hours a day in solitary confinement in a windowless six- by-nine-foot cell. 14 A few weeks before his final execution date, a last -ditch investigation unearthed a microfiche copy of a laboratory report never previously disclosed by prosecutors or law enforcement.15 The exculpatory evidence in that report eventually led to Thompson's release.16 Despite their differences, the cases of Thompson and Inhofe share a salient theme. They raise concerns about the unfairness and inefficiency caused when government agents do not reveal information that is beneficial to the defense. In criminal cases like Thompson's, such discovery obligations are imposed by Brady v. Maryland 17 and related cases, criminal discovery rules, and codes of professional ethics.18 But two recent Supreme Court cases seriously undermined the already weak enforceability of those discovery duties.19 In Thompson's case, five justices gave a wink and nod to Brady violations; the Court vacated Thompson's $14,000,000 damages award despite prosec utors' conceded violation of their due process discovery duties.20 The same majority told prosecutors who comply with Brady that they can be damned if they do; the First Amendment could not shield prosecutor Richard Ceballos from his supervisors' retaliatio n when he brought Brady information to light.21 No single -issue lobby, group of legislators, or movie star reacted to the experiences of Thompson or Ceballos by demanding nationally applicable, mandatory criminal discovery reform along the lines of Inhofe's Bill of Rights for private pilots.22 And when a few U .S. senators recently sought criminal discovery Safety Board are simp ly \"rubber stamps,\" Lowy, supra note 1, the Pilot's Bill of Rights expands appeal rights and reduces deference to FAA rulings.

The federal Fairness in Disclosure Act would have significantly strengthened discovery duties by defining them more broadly and by shifting the burden of proof, requiring prosecutors to prove that nondisclosure of information that \"may reasonably appear to be favorable\" to the defendant was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

A federal regulatory action against a private pilot raises very different concerns than those at issue in a criminal prosecution. The civil rights claims raised by Thompson and Ceballos under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 also raised distinctive stakes in the contest between federal deference to local authority on one hand and the vindication of federal constitutional rights on the other.35 But the m agnitude of the respective threats by the FAA and federal prosecutors to the interests of Inhofe and Stevens is minuscule compared with the very nearly successful attempt of New Orleans prosecutors to \"fry\" Thompson, a young, low -income African American man accused of murdering the wealthy white son of a prominent local businessman. 36 The disparate responses to these cases might be dismissed as illustrating a political principle so basic as to be banal: Them as has, gets. Sharp systemic disparities enhance ( for some) and hinder (for others) access to the political influence necessary to drive change. Inhofe occupies one end of the spectrum. His speed and strength in manipulating the levers of power appear steroid enhanced. Thompson's case arose at the other e nd of the spectrum \u2014amid the democracy deficit at an intersection of crime, race, and poverty. 37 That intersection is 30 Id. at 1332- 33 (discussing N.C.

More specifically, this approach prioritizes direct participation by poor people and people of color, not only in the formation and oversight of what are too often perceived as criminal injustice systems, but also in reversing criminogenic policies that rely on those systems as mechanisms of social control. Thus, a democracy - enhancing emphasis holds intrinsic value as well as promise for improving crime prevention, system legitimacy, and case outcomes. The argument unfolds in five parts. P art I contextualizes the despairity narrative in criminal law and procedure within a broader and cyclical retrenchment across movements f or racial and economic justice. Part II explains the attraction of a democracy enhancement theory and sketches its cont ours. Parts III and IV train this roughly honed theoretical lens on North Carolina's previously unmapped cluster of pionee ring criminal justice reforms. Part III examines the regressive socioeconomic and political state history that made these reforms unli kely. Part IV describes the reforms and assesses their democracy -enhancing potential. While each helps to level power disparities, two pack significant punch. First, evidence -based early intervention programs , such as Nurse-Family Partnerships , build capac ities for resilience and self -governance while costing pennies on the dollar vis -\u00e0-vis investment in criminal justice apparatuses. At the opposite, most resource- intensive end of the criminal justice spectrum, North Carolina's Racial Justice Act vindicated the dignitary interests and participatory rights of diverse decision makers in capital juries by redressing racial bias in the exercise of peremptory strikes. Part V acknowledges that , just as motives for North Carolina's constellation of criminal justice reforms have been mixed, so too their effectiveness and abilities VIOLENT CRIME 1-3, 5, tbl.5 (2007), available at http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/bvvc .pdf (discussing disproportionate violent crime victimization of African Americans); Erica J.

Distinguishing characteristics include institutionalized capacities for critical reflection and collaboration on hot -button criminal justice issues. Oppositional politics also play a role. They are informed by a relatively robust and proactive indigent defense function and diverse mechanisms fo r the collection, assessment, and strategic use of criminal justice data. The Article concludes that those conditions privilege advocacy by elites, and highlights examples of direct action by low -income people and people of color as a vital component of a more broadly democratic foundation for criminal law and procedure and, ultimately, of any sustainable turn away from criminogenic policies that feed the carceral state. I. DESPAIRITY IN CONTEXT This Part identifies the despairity narrative in criminal law and procedure as a tendency to despair of litigation and legislation as avenues to reform given demographic disparities in access to those levers of power. Th is Part also contextualizes th e despairity narrative within a broader a nd cyclical retrenchment across movements for racial and economic justice. Part I.A discusses sources of the democracy deficit at the intersection of crime, race, and poverty. Part I.B focuses on the despairity motif among criminal justice scholars. Part I .C situates that motif amidst an old and ongoing struggle to fulfill what historian John Hope Franklin described as this country's broken \"promise of real equality.\" 46 A. Human Beings and Citizens: Sources of the Democracy Deficit In October 2010, as Inhofe was landing his plane in south Texas; as attorneys were preparing to argue Thompson's case before the Supreme Court; and as special prosecutors were investigating government suppression of exculpatory evidence in Stevens' s case, eleven men from a Brook lyn housing project were hammering out plea deals on federal drug and weapons charges. United States v. Bannister 47 discusses the outcome in these cases. For several reasons, Bannister provides a distinctive window into the sources of the democracy deficit that contributed to the disparate long -term outcomes in the Inhofe , Thompson, and Stevens cases. First, Bannister 's opening lines transform a mine -run federal sentencing decision into a cri de coeur over lives impaled at the intersection of crime, race, and poverty. The judiciary is generally dis inclined to detail the recalcitrant links between rac ial and class disparities in rates of undereducation, unemployment, 45 Cf. EDWARD HALLETT CARR, WHAT IS HISTORY ? 153 (1961) (\"[N]o sane person ever believed in a kind of progress which advanced in an unbroken straight line without reverses and deviations and b reaks in continuity so that even the sharpest reverse is not necessarily fatal to the belief.\"). 46 John Hope Franklin, Foreword , in DEMOCRACY BETRAYED xi-xii (David S.

That analysis was informed by the highly unusual personal visit of a presiding judge to the neighborhood in which the defendants lived and committed their crimes.49 The opinion's findings and conclusions are also noteworthy. The court found \"substantial evidence\" that mandatory minimum sentences for crack cocaine charges are the unconstitutional result of racial prejudice. 50 The court further concluded that factors shaping defendants' lives and opportunities rendered several of the mandatory minimum prison sentences excessive.51 Finally, the court acknowledged the improbabil ity that scarce public funds w ould support the rehabilitation programs required by the sentencing order or that the defendants' imprisonment w ould yield any positive outcome whatsoever. To the contrary, the court observed that the defendants were likely co ndemned upon completion of their sentences to lives in \"a permanent underclass with almost no opportunity to achieve economic stability, let alone the American dream of upward mobility.\" 52 The opinion's final lines are circumspect. The court insists that w hile the defendants are hemmed in by circumstances, the law must believe that free will offers an escape. Otherwise, its vaunted belief in redemption and deterrence \u2014both specific and general \u2014is a euphemism for cruelty. These defendants are not merely crim inals, but human beings and fellow American citizens, deserving of an opportunity for rehabilitation. Even now, they are capable of useful lives, lived lawfully. 53 Bannister 's parting words embody the court's relentlessly grim inability to match the defendants' capacities for \"useful lives, lived lawfully\" with even a remote likelihood that opportunities for rehabilitation will find any actualization. The court's need to expressly affirm not only the defendants' citizenship but also their humanity spe aks volumes about their exclusion from approved structures of 48 But see Kowalski v. Tesmer, 543 U.S. 125, 140 (2004) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (noting that 70% of defendants represented by appointed counsel plead guilty; 70% of those plea -convicted defendants serve time in jail or prison; and nearly 70% of incarcerate d inmates failed to graduate high school and are in the lowest two of five literacy levels \u2014and therefore unable, for example, to \"use a bus schedule\").

From Disparity to Despairity Bannister adds an important chapter to a massive literature on the racialized, politicized, and industrialized criminal justice policies in the United States; their contribution to unprecedented levels of incarceration; and the harsh effects on the low-income and mi nority individuals who disproportionately encounter criminal justice systems\u2014often with multiple identities of victim, accused defendant, actual perpetrator, and witness.55 That literature has been decades in the making. More than a century ago , W.E.B. DuBois exposed the incommensurably low rates of education and employment and inversely high rates of criminal justice involvement for urban African American males.56 In the same era, Ida B. Wells barely escaped lynching during a career dedicated to identifying and challenging structural forms of repressive violence manifest not only in extralegal executions but also in convict leasing \u2014two social control mechanisms that systematically resoldered well -forged links between crime, class, and color. 57 Of course , historical comparisons must be approached with caution.58 As Marie Gottschalk notes, \"[T]he creation of the carceral state was more subtle and complex than just drawing a straight line from the plantation to Jim Crow to the ghetto to the prison- industrial compl ex today.\" 59 Whether the democracy deficit at the intransigent intersection of race, class, and crime is described in terms of the New Jim Crow 60 or hyperincarceration,61 the upshot is the same.

As noted above, Banniste r is unusual in its extensive judicial discussion of these issues. The opinion also is remarkable in being so thoroughly unremarked. Months after the decision issued, it ha d received virtually no citation or commentary from jurists,64 scholars,65 practitione rs,66 or the press.67 This silence may be partly ad hominem . Some view the opinion's author, Judge Jack B. Weinstein, as \"a legal maverick\" whose \"liberal decisions have angered conservatives and run afoul of appellate courts.\" 68 But Bannister 's silent treatment also may illustrate disparity begetting despairity. To be sure, disproportionate arrest, conviction, and sentencing rates along lines of race, ethnicity, and class are not confined to the United States. 69 Nevertheless, the intractability of this c ountry's distinctive inequalities at the intersection of crime, race, and poverty often lead to skepticism if not despair toward litigation, legislation, and activism as quintessentially democratic avenues toward sustainable reform in criminal law and proc edure.

Twenty years ago, Professor Donald Dripps used public choice theory to ask and answer the question, \"Why Don't Legislatures Give a Damn About the R ights of the Accused ?\"79 More recently, Professors Marc Miller and Ronald Wright cited tough -on-crime politics as justifying the subordination of litigation and legislation in favor of internal bureaucratic reform as the most effective avenue for regulating prosecutorial decision making.80 And the New Jim Crow scholarship, while offering the most recent analysis of penal politics as a mechanism for caste construction and control, points to little empirical or theoretical ground from which to reclaim law and 77 Stuntz, Unequal Justice , supra note 75, at 1974, 1982- 97, 2031- 39.

The dominant narrative contains good reasons for skepticism toward litigation, legislation, and activism as meaningful avenues for reducing the footprint of th e carceral state while obtaining greater transparency, accountability, and fairness in the formation and implementation of criminal law and procedure. The hurdles to reform are daunting. Nor is the despairity narrative confined to theorists and practitione rs who work on criminal justice issues.

While roughly honed, this theoretical lens is adequate for the analytical and normative work undertaken in Parts III through V. II.

Minimally, self -governance means exercising rational and emotional intelligence to check concentrated power. Maximally, democracy enhancement promotes the exercise of moral imagination through equal participation by individuals -in- communit y in the pursuit of equal dignity and human flourishing.120 The metaethical stance is pragmatic and eclectic. The theory aims to bridge oppositions between retributivism's deontological rules , which emphasize the autonomous individual's generation of and submission to the morally just precept, and utilitarianism's teleological go als, which emphasize maximal well -being. Kantian respect for the equal dignity of persons unites with critical theory's recognition that communicative action necessarily entails intersubjectivity. Appreciation for classical virtues \u2014courage, temperance, pru dence, and justice \u2014is tempered of hubris, perfectionism, and end- of-history narratives. 121 The subject of self -governance, the individual -in-community, is more than a consumer or producer of goods.122 Self-governance is an activity occurring simultaneously and in multiple spheres. At the level of individual impulse, self - governance involves interaction between the amygdala and the frontal lobe. Self - governance also unfolds in contests and collaboration between and among individuals, groups, institutions and other collective interests. Thus , democracy as self -governance is simultaneously an ongoing set of activities and an ideal never fully achieved. 123 In the criminal justice context, democracy occurs more or less \u2014mostly less at the intersection of crime, race, and poverty \u2014as actors exercise and shape discretion in varied settings, often with multiple, overlapping, and shifting roles. Criminal justice stories involve perpetrators and victims, accusers and accused. But as the Banniste r decision indicates, those actors and identities are just the tip of the iceberg. Relevant acts and omissions also flow from parents, extended families, schools, neighborhood organizations, and churches; businesses, foundations, and public service provide rs; the popular press and other media; legislative and executive branch representatives (including mayors, governors, and appointed panels or commissions) and their constituencies; law enforcement, prosecutors, defense counsel, juries, and judges ; correcti ons personnel , and probation, parole, or other reentry workers. 120 Moore , supra note 91, at 159, 163- 70, 186 -89. 121 See, e.g. , REINHOLD NIEBUHR , THE IRONY OF AMERICAN HISTORY 138 (1952) (\"A too confident sense of justice always leads to injustice.\") ; cf. CORNEL WEST, PROPHESY DELIVERANCE ! AN AFRO-AMERICAN REVOLUTIONARY CHRISTIANITY 17 (1982) (\"This emphasis on process, development discontinuity, and even disruption precludes the possibility of human perfection and human utopias.\"). 122 Moore, supra note 91, at 167 -70. 123 Cf.

Wolin, Fugitive Democracy, in DEMOCRACY AND DIFFERENCE 31, 43 (1996) (\"Democracy needs to be reconceived as something other than a form of government: as a mode of being that is conditioned by bitter experience, doomed to succeed only temporarily, but is a recurrent possibility as long as the memory of the political survives.\"). 2014] DEMOCR ACY ENHANCEMENT 565 To enhance democracy in the formation, implementation, and oversight of criminal law and procedure, particularly at the tail end of these relational networks, is to prioritize participation by the low -income and minority individuals who are most directly and disproportionately affected by crime and criminal justice systems, particularly at the front end. Such an approach has the potential not only to improve crime prevention and case outcomes, but also to shore up the often fragile legitimacy of what many perceive, with some justification, to be criminal injustice systems. To that end, a democracy -enhancing theory of criminal law and procedure persistently asks whether and how particular developments promote self - governance, the reduction of the carceral footprint, and the shaping and oversight of criminal justice policies and institutions by the low -income and minority individuals and communities disproportionately affected by crime, its causes , and its consequences. This approach incorporates aspects of traditional justifications for criminal law while demanding more. Democracy enhancement takes moral desert more seriously than retributivism , aims for more effective deterrence than utilitarianism , sharpens the focus of rehabilitative theory , and may provide more stable ground for the healing relationships that constitute restorative justice. B. Why Democracy? The call for a democracy -enhancing theory of criminal law and procedure raises impor tant questions. Their comprehensive identification and discussion is beyond the preliminary sketch offered here, but several warrant immediate attention. I s democracy enhancement too narrow a lens through which to reimagine and refocus criminal law and procedure? Does this focus foreground procedure at the expense of substantive justice? Conversely, is democracy enhancement too protean a concept to be useful? Does this approach improperly discount interest convergence and cost -benefit analysis as effective reform tactics? 1. Is Democracy Too Small? Professor Allegra McLeod helpfully raises the first questions about the limits of a democracy -enhancing focus , noting that attempts to improve existing criminal justice systems are often merely ameliorative and can even make things worse. 124 McLeod rightly insists that reformers must keep their eyes unswervingly on the decarceration prize.125 To that end, she argues for an imaginative stance that identifies and pursues \"unfi nished alternatives\" to the carceral state.126 124 Allegra McLeod, Decarceration Courts: Possibilities and Perils of a Shifting Criminal Law , 100 GEO. L.J. 1587, 1615 -30 (2012) [hereinafter Decarceration Courts ] (discussing flaws in alternative court models). 125 Id. at 1632; see also Allegra McLeod, Confronting Criminal Law's Violence: The Possibilities of Unfinished Alternatives , 8 UNBOUND : HARV. J. LEGAL LEFT 109, 129-30 (2013) [hereinafter Confronting Violence ] (arguing for regrounding of social controls outside of criminal justice apparatuses). 126 McLeod, Confronting Violence , supra note 125, at 132. 566 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 The carceral norm is a national addiction. Reformers too readily serve as enablers. But McLeod's decarceration proposals require more than expanded \"imaginative horizons.\"127 They require revised patterns of resource allocation.128 Those revisions in turn require a robust and sustainable oppositional politics. A democracy -enhancing theory of criminal law and procedure aims simultaneously to reimagine the justification and purpos e of criminal justice systems while reducing the footprint of the carceral state. The theory does so by prioritizing the empowerment of low -income and minority individuals and communities to participate more fully in the formation and implementation of criminal justice policies. That participation is not merely procedural , nor is it an end in itself. The animating principle and goal of a democracy -enhancing theory is the actualization of equal human dignity. Essential prerequisites include reducing criminal offending and victimization as well as the predictable causes and consequences of crime discussed in Bannister . Thus, a democracy -enhancing theory bridges dichotomies pitting procedural versus substantive justice, utilitarian goals versus deontological rules , and the exercise of free will by autonomous individuals versus the collective generation and enforcement of norms and identities. 2. Is Democracy Too Large? A democracy -enhancing theory of criminal law and procedure acknowledges cost-benefit analysis and interest convergence as useful reform tactics. But there are good reasons to maintain an arm's -length partnership with homo economicus ,129 some of which are empirical. As noted above, budget cutting grows more or less salient as state capitalism spins through repetitive boom -and-bust cycles. Moreover, as discussed in Part IV.B .1, \"smart on crime\" and \"justice reinvestment\" initiatives tend to morph away from evidence -based prevention via human capital development and toward extension of surveillance and control structures. Those policy choices are predictable despite their criminogenesis 130 and the fact that evidence- based prevention costs pennies on the increasingly scarce tax dollar.131 Indeed, a s Professor James Forman notes, black -majority jurisdictions , such as Washington, D.C. , also exhibit tough- on-crime hyperincarceration patterns.132 Such decision making belies rational choice theory in part because the theory rests on a flawed account of hum an subjectivity. On that account, the subject is 127 Id. at 113. 128 Id. at 113, 116, 118, 130. 129 See supra note 91. I thank Mike Cassidy for inspiring the analysis in this subpart. 130 See, e.g. , L.M.

Yet according to Professor Daniel Kahneman, winner of a Nobel Prize in economics, \" it is self -evident tha t people are neither fully rational nor completely selfish, and that their tastes are anything but stable.\"133 Emotion regularly trumps critical analysis.134 Fear and anger over crime and perceptions of crime overr ide data- driven policy making. Moreover, to th e extent that self -interested rationality is at work, cycles of criminogenesis, victimization, arrest, prosecution, incarceration, and recidivism feed too many families. Interests converging around cost cutting inevitably collide with countervailing , conve rging interests of myriad stakeholders. Among the more obvious are law enforcement officers and forensic analysts; prosecutors and victim advocates; judges and court personnel; probation and parole officers; and defense attorneys , investigators, and paralegals. Layers of administrators keep the machinery running . Jails and prisons employ thousands , with prisons i ncreasingly run for profit and sited in low -income rural areas. Universities and nonprofit organizations receive millions of dollars ann ually in tax and foundation dollars to evaluate, critique, advise, and attempt to reform these stakeholders and the systems in which they are mutually embedded. Cost-benefit analysis and interest convergence are useful tactics for treating symptoms but ca nnot cure such metastasis. 3. Is Democracy Just Right? There are more than empirical reasons for circumspection toward privileging cost-benefit analysis and interest convergence in the struggle for sustainable criminal justice reform. Democracy enhancement draws upon a richer and deeper normative commitment \u2014often overshadowed, if not actively repressed, by dominant utilitarian analyses \u2014to the equal dignity of persons. 135 As discussed in Part I.C, it is ultimately the deep normative pull of that commitmen t\u2014the commitment to fulfill what Franklin called the broken promise of \"real equality\"136\u2014that explains small and large expansions of human rights and corresponding obligations in the struggle against equally radical commitments to the development and mainte nance of hierarchy .137 The democracy deficit at the intersection of crime, race, and poverty throws the unsatisfactory nature of that progress into sharp relief. Professor Steven L. Winter's archeology of democratic theory is helpful in unpacking these poin ts. Winter highlights the critical role of interpersonal respect 133 DANIEL KAHNEMAN , THINKING , FAST AND SLOW 269 (2011) . 134 See, e.g. , id. at 252 -53 (discussing optimistic bias); id. at 380- 85 (discussing the peak -end rule and duration neglect). 135 See Moore , supra note 91. 136 Franklin, supra note 46, at xii. 137 Cf. JAMES T. KLOPPENBERG , UNCERTAIN VICTORY : SOCIAL DEMOCRACY AND PROGRESSIVISM IN EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN THOUGHT , 1870- 1920, at 373 (1986) (noting that only deeply norm -driven reforms can \"be more than cosmetic\"). 568 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 in the classical conception of isonomia.138 He contrasts democracy's philosophical and etymological roots, which are grounded in the power ( kratos ) of the masses (demos ), with those of isonomia, which references equal participation in the generation and administration of law.139 Winter's discussion of isonomia points to an underlying historical shift from thesmos to nomos \u2014from the external to the internal generation of perceived obligation.140 Legi timacy means lawfulness. That meaning derives from mutuality. Winter emphasizes that the collaborative activity of self -governance requires \"fortitude and initiative \u2014the virtue\" of habitually and actively controlling public institutions.141 As the Bannister opinion indicates, unique hurdles impede the development and exercise of these capacities at the intersectio n of crime, race, and poverty. A democracy -enhancing theory of criminal law and procedure aims to knock down those hurdles. In terms of deep norms and theory, this approach claims isomoiria , the joinder of political and economic equality,142 as a precondition of isonomia, mutual and legitimate self -governance. Expressly claiming Franklin's \"real equality\" as a deep norm allows a democracy -enhancing the ory to incorporate and improve upon the traditional criminal law justifications of retributivism and deterrence. C. Democracy Enhancement and Criminal Theory Retributivism insists that \"fr ee will offers an escape\"143 from circumstances, such as resource disparities, that provide contexts for and shape decision making. On this theory, it is the ineluctably moral decision of an autonomous individual to do an illegal act that warrants condemnation and punishment. Retribu tivism's focus on individual moral desert allows for consideration of resource disparities (whether capital, human, or social) at various pivot points in the system. Existing data collection and assessment limit analysis of the degree to which those factor s affect declination by crime victims, law enforcement officers, and prosecutors, respectively, to accuse, arrest, or charge. Consideration of these factors is most regularized in the application of rules that mitigate charge level and sentence. 144 A blunter instrument is the Supreme Court's recent use of developmental neurobiology to draw bright -line sentencing limits under the Eighth Amendment.145 138 Steven L.

Virginia, 536 U.S. 304, 314- 16 (2002) (barring execution of defendants with mental retardation). 2014] DEMOCR ACY ENHANCEMENT 569 But r etributivism is itself profoundly immoral to the extent that it fails to account for and remediate structura l disparities that, on one hand, significantly enhance the rewards of criminal offending,146 and, on the other, inhibit participation in policy formation and implementation\u2014that is, the definition of crime and the oversight of its enforcement \u2014by the low -income people and people of color who have disproportionate contact with crime and criminal justice systems. A democracy -enhancing theory of criminal law and procedure should focus like a laser on the concentrated disadvantage that characterizes the intersecti on of crime, race , and poverty to promote the development and exercise of personal and communal self -governance. A democracy -enhancement emphasis can usefully recalibrate other traditional theoretical justifications for criminal law. For utilitarians , this new emphasis holds promise for addressing the delegitimization and reduced deterrent effect of criminal justice systems for those excluded from system generation and oversight. Democracy enhancement's prioritization of self -governance also can produ ctively refine rehabilitative theory by directing efforts toward fuller integration of individuals -in-communit y and citizens into the polity. With respect to restorative justice, enhancing self -governance by redressing real and perceived disparities in power, authority, and privilege within and across the systems in which crime and punishment are generated can improve possibilities for \u2014and, indeed, is likely prerequisite to \u2014personal healing and mending of broken relationships. D. Resources for Theory Bui lding Future work will hone this quick sketch of a democracy- enhancing theory for criminal law and procedure. There are a number of resources for the task. Again, pragmatism entails eclecticism. Theory development should be interdisciplinary. Debates amon g criminologists are salient, particularly as they contest the racial invariance of concentrated disadvantage as a factor causing criminal justice involvement. 147 Social psychology and other cognitive sciences, including developmental neurobiology, also have much to offer. Pertinent areas of investigation include identification of factors that contribute to or hinder resiliency in the face of stress,148 as well as discussions of the existence, verifiability, and 146 Regina Austin, \"The Black Community,\" Its Lawbreakers, and a Politics of Identification , 65 S. CAL. L. REV. 1769, 1774-87 (1992). 147 On the debate over racial invariance in the relationship between concentrated disadvantage and crime, compare Sampson & Bean, supra note 38, at 8, 11 (discussing \"resilient\" invariance findings related to \"factors representing disadvantage, e.g., differing combinations of poverty, income, family disruption, and joblessness/unemployment\"), with Jeffery T.

Development of a democracy -enhancing the ory of criminal law and procedure resonates with Adler's pathbreaking work on fair distribution as central to inequality -averse social welfare economic theory.151 Adler's framing of social welfare economic theory emphasizes the discipline's normative clout.152 He resists the prevalent cabining of utilitarian well -being to the satisfaction of personal preference. He deduces a formula for evaluating the contribution of decision outcomes to enhanced individual well -being with priority given to improving the lot of the less well -off. Significant for purposes of developing a democracy- enhancing theory of criminal law and procedure, Adler acknowledges the need to account for the extent to which individuals shape their own opportunities and life histories. 153 Personal re sponsibility, or free will, must be incorporated as a vari able in his economic calculus. In the field of political philosophy, Young and Benhabib provide feminist revisions of critical theory's discourse model. These scholars work with th e model's three co re commitments: (1) communication and, more specifically, rational argument is constitutive of human identity; (2) an ideal speech situation requir es commitment to consensus, such that all who are affected by a discourse outcome agree to that outcome (the universalization principle); and (3) all 149 See, e.g. , Amy L.

She prioritizes three questions: Who is at the table? Who is speaking or purporting to speak for whom? Who is privileging which manner of communication? 157 These questions must remain front and center in addressing the democracy deficit at the intersectio n of crime, race, and poverty. In Young's assessment, adversarialism is built into consensus generation as a necessary oppositional moment. Deliberation requires capacities for \"no - saying,\"158 self-reflection, and reality checking as participants struggle to see, hear, and understand contentions raised from perspectives different from their own. In Young's phrasing, \"struggle is a proce ss of communicative engagement \" between members of a democratic society ; because the \"field of struggle is not level[,] . . . [d]isorderly, disruptive, annoying, or distracting means of communication are often necessary.\" 159 Young therefore resists moves to restrict discourses or their mode of expression to formal argument, appeals to a common good, or those that some label as moderate and civil. By retaining discourse theory's dual emphases on equal access to deliberative processes and the production of genuine consensus, Young distinguishes her \"agonistic\" description of democratic formation as struggle from liber al theory's \"aggregative model.\" 160 In her view, the latter entails zero -sum, majoritarian competition among ostens ibly morally neutral policy preferences \u2014a competition that fails to afford adequate structural protections against the perpetuation and reinforcement of \"might makes right\" dominance.161 In contrast, a theory that is fully attentive to particularized differe nces of other -regarding equals obtains a richer capacity for intersubjective transformation and the reshaping of \"private, self-regarding desire into public appeals to justice.\"162 154 See, e.g. , IRIS MARION YOUNG , INCLUSION AND DEMOCRACY 22-51 (2000); Seyla Benhabib, Toward a Deliberative Model of Democratic Legitimacy , in DEMOCRACY AND DIFFERENCE : CONTESTING THE BOUNDARIES OF THE POLITICAL 67, 69- 74, 78, 81 -87 (Seyla Benhabib ed., 1996). 155 See, e.g. , YOUNG , supra note 154, at 37 -44. 156 Iris Marion Young, Communication and the Other: Beyond Deliberative Democracy, in DEMOCRACY AND DIFFERENCE , supra note 154, at 120, 121; Benhabib , supra note 154, at 67, 84. 157 YOUNG , supra note 154, at 37- 44. 158 Stephen K.

Critics question whether that possibility can be actualized on any meaningful scale and challenge the real -world efficacy of both social welfare economics163 and deliberativist models as avenues toward change.164 For example, skeptics focus both on the improbability of any broad, sustainable will to engage in such communication165 and the inefficiency of oppositional, sel f-reflective moments that inevitably become to a greater or lesser degree \"[d]isorderly, disruptive, annoying, or distracting.\"166 Recent empirical research supports a more hopeful view.167 For example, people want to engage in face- to-face deliberation on pol icy matters \u2014and seize opportunities to do so, including across boundaries of class, race, and ethnicity \u2014more readily than skeptics might anticipate.168 And in some circumstances, \"deliberative drift\" allows communication to shift back and forth across the border between zero -sum negotiations and richer normative discourse, trust -building, and engagement toward consensus building.169 But a more pointed criticism highlights the challenges and failures of efforts to empower those at the receiving end of systems. T he low -income and minority communities most directly and disproportionately affected by crime, its causes, and its consequences face onerous obstacles to active participation in the formation, implementation, and oversight of the policies and institutions that create and maintain those systems. 170 Parts III through V respond to that concern by testing the rudimentary democracy -enhancement theory sketched here.

III. A PRETTY QUESTION : WHY NORTH CAROLINA ? Given the depth and intransigence of the resource disparities encountered in circumstances of concentrated disadvantage and the correspondi ngly limited political capital of the low -income and minority communities that disproportionately experience crime and criminal justice systems, reform initiatives within these systems are remarkable\u2014and should be remarked upon.171 It is especially interesting to find a constellation of cutting -edge reforms in a single jurisdiction seldom seen as a hotbed of progressive politics.172 North Carolina is a case in point.173 This jurisdiction was the first in the nation to adopt mandatory, statewide full open- file discovery in criminal cases.174 Full open- file discovery resulted from hard- fought litigation and the opportunistic exploitation of what was, by all appearances, a wholly unpromising political moment.175 Despite pushback from prosecutors, the case law and legisl ative history have continued to trend toward greater openness and enforceability.176 171 See Moore, supra note 13, at 1375 -77; cf. Jennifer E. Laurin, Still Convicting the Innocent , 90 TEX. L. REV. 1473, 1499 (2012) (reviewing B RANDON L. GARRETT , CONVICTING THE INNOCENT : WHERE CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS GO WRON G (2011) and querying institutional explanations for North Carolina's distinctive Innocence Inquiry Commission). Some remark that things could be worse. See Darryl K. Brown, Democracy and Decriminalization, 86 TEX. L. REV. 223, 234- 48 (2007) (describing the \"substantially contracted\" field of criminal law's effect on \"most people\" and the failure of many tough - on-crime bills in three state legislatures) ; cf.

Id. 574 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 But full open- file discovery is just one of several pioneering criminal justice reforms in this single and unlikely jurisdiction. As discussed in more detail in Part IV, other cutting -edge reforms have focused on identif ying and reduc ing wrongful convictions; increasing efficiency and lessening cost; and curing demographic disparities in criminal offending and victimization as well as in the processing of criminal cases. Before describing that constellation of reforms, this Part searches the state's socioeconomic and political history for some clues about their genes is. Hunting for hints of democracy enhancement at the intersection of race, crime, and poverty reveals a pat tern better described as democracy assaulting. A. Race, Populism, and Tar Heel Politics: An Introduction North Carolina's previously unheralded leadership in criminal justice reform raises what historian V.O. Key , Jr. described in 1949 as the \"pretty question\" regarding jurisdictional motiv ations and aptitudes for change. 177 Key's opus, Southern Politics in State and Nation, is best known for developing racial threat analysis and linking it to what was then a distinctively weak adversarial partisan politic s across southern states. 178 Key labeled North Carolina as the South's \"Progressive Plutocracy.\"179 He saw the state as \"far more 'presentable' than its southern neighbors\" in . . state's \"consistently sensitive appreciation of Negro rights\" and \"spirit of self -examination\" driven in part by a strong commitment to public education. 181 Key left much untold. He ignored or belittled the active role African Americans played in crafting their own political and economic destiny.182 He papered over the state's history of murderous racial violence.183 He was inattentive 177 V.O.

K ey emphasized the former aspect of the state's Janus- faced sociopolitical culture. 187 Frank Porter Graham and Terry Sanford are typically identified with this lesser -known aspect.188 In contrast, f or many, the state's dominant aspect is indelibly embodied in Jesse Helms, \"an unyielding icon of conservatives and archenemy of liberals .\"189 For thirty years, North Carolina voters sent Helms to the U .S. Senate as a champion of low taxes, small government, free markets, and traditional social values. As one voter pu t it, it was impossible to \"get to the right of Helms without falling plumb off the Earth .\" Some put Helms alongside Ronald Reagan as a key catalyst and communicator of conservatism's resurgence in the late twentieth and early twenty -first centuries. 190 Nationally syndicated political columnist David Carolina was dominated by whites and \"transcended party lines.\" See, e.g. , ERIC FONER , RECONSTRUCTION : AMERICA 'S UNFINISHED REVOLUTION 1863- 1877, at 387-89 (1984). 184 KEY, supra note 177, at 211 -15. 185 Charles Reagan Wilson, The Morality -Driven South: Populists, Prohibitionists, Religion, and V.O.

Historically, the S tate's formation and application of criminal law and procedure, like the use of extralegal violence, have been closely focused on the intersection of race, class, and gender hierarchies. Colonial slave codes morphe d into nineteenth- century black codes, which sprang into new life in post -Reconstruction Jim Crow laws. Such shape - shifting typically responded to socioeconomic and political advances by African Americans. 192 The pattern is evident in North Carolina's racial ized application of court -sanctioned and extralegal executions as well as in other instances of mass political violence. As discussed below, that pattern began in the colonial period and developed in an econom y dependent on low -cost labor. B. From Slave Codes to the Wilmington Massacre Of the nearly 800 judicially sanctioned executions carried out in North Carolina's first 235 years as a colony and a state, more than 70% targeted African Americans; during the same period, three whites were execut ed for crimes against African Americans.193 Aggravated forms of execution, including burning at the stake, were reserved for \"petit treason\"\u2014 the uniquely threatening offenses of slave revolt and husband killing.194 The imbalanced application of capital punishment was so profound and long -standing that even after the advent of the electric chair , Novel Relationships in the New System of Campaign Finance , 3 J.L. & POL. 423, 433 (1987). 191 Broder, supra note 189; see also C HRISTENSEN , supra note 187, at 269 (describing Helms's nationally televise d response to the phoned- in suggestion that he receive \"a Nobel Peace Prize for everything [he had] done to help keep down the niggers\") ; Linda Chavez, Race to the Finish: The Supreme Court and the FCC's Racial Preference Program , 44 ARK.

Some were burned at the stake or beheaded. The decapitated heads were mounted on stakes to inspire terror and submission.197 The state legislature soon stripped free blacks of voting rights.198 Additional new laws forbade slaves and free blacks from preaching, teaching, or public speaking in any forum.199 Teaching literacy to African Americans became a crime.200 Reactionary violence also marred Reconstruction. For example, freed blacks and whites formed Union Leagues in the pursuit of political and economic self - education and advocacy (as well as in self -defense).201 Ku Klux Klan thugger y soon eliminated that cooperation.202 Despite such violent suppression, in the 1870s, while other Southern states fell to Redemptionist takeovers, North Carolina retained a Republican governor and rejected a revanchist white- supremacist constitution. 203 Then , in 1892 and 1894, low-income farm workers and other rural white Populists joined with black and white Republicans to take the governor's mansion, the state legislature, and several local governmental councils, commissions, and appointed positions from Democrats. 204 These Fus ionists sought to increase \"the liberty of the laboring people, both white and black.\"205 They \"capped interest rates on personal debt, increased expenditures for public education, shifted the weight of taxation from individuals to corporations and railroads , and made generous appropriations to state charitable and correctional institutions.\" 206 They also expanded voting rights and local democracy, instituting city and county elections in place of legislatively appointed authorities. 207 195 Kotch & Mosteller, supra note 193, at 2039 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also id. at 2043- 56 (examining the history of race and executions in North Carolina). 196 Stephen Kantrowitz, The Two Faces of Domination in Nor th Carolina, 1800- 1898, in DEMOCRACY BETRAYED , supra note 46, at 97 -102. 197 DAVID S.

Race, Class, Labor , and the War on Poverty North Carolina's racially imbalanced application of state-sanctioned and private violence devolved in an economy dependent on low -cost labor. After the 1898 white supremacist revolution, the state's textile and tobacco industries began a period of explosive growth. Most nonfactory workers were sharecroppers. 243 And, as reflected in the \"WHITE PEOPLE WAKE UP\" flyer, factory work was considered \"whites only\" for decades, particularly in the textile industry . 244 The tobacco industry was integrated, but shop foremen were white and the dirtiest work was reserved for African American employees. Black tobacco workers engaged in significant union organizing ; ensuing self-education projects and voter drives shifted the balance in some local elections.

Milder union- busting tactics in 1900 included owners closing mills, company stores, and housing to union members. Workers were blacklisted and their families left homeless, without \"provisions [or] contact with the outside world, for the post office was in the company store.\"246 In 1929, strikes were crushed in violent melees that led to criminal convictions of union workers and nolle pros equi decisions or acquittals for those a ccused of attacking or killing strikers.247 The latter group of defendants often comprised local s heriffs ' deputies or state National Guardsmen.248 That antiunion fervor was formalized in 1947, as North Carolina pioneered \"right to work\" statutes that crimina lized \"closed shop\" agreements between business and labor.249 In 1949, the U .S. Supreme Court gave those laws a constitutional stamp of approval.250 Thereafter the Congress of Industrial Organizations mounted an aggressive seven -year organizing campaign called \"Operation Dixie\" \u2014but deliberately retreated from previously active recruitment across racial lines. Ultimately antiunion regulations, the segregated workforce , tensions between the black laboring and middle classes , and the real and imaginary links between unions and the Communist Party combined to hinder the development of organized labor in North Carolina.251 The War on Poverty hit similar walls in the 1960s. As in the earlier Progressive and Fusion eras, there was some significant cooperation across color lines. Striking examples of such cooperation include the actions of Klan leaders Lloyd Jacobs and C.P. Ellis. Jacobs, an ex- convict, recruited NAACP members, student activists, and low -income people to join him in protesting prison conditions through an organization called the North Carolina Justice Committee. 252 Ellis was a vocal opponent of school integration, the civil rights movement, and War on Poverty efforts to aid blacks. He was astonished to be elected cochair of a community council responsible for creating a school desegregation plan \u2014 particularly because he shared the role with black activist Ann Atwater.

Congress incorporated MFP requirements into legislation such as the Economic Opportunity Act (EOA) and the Model Cities Act.256 The MFP mandate was modeled on the North Carolina Fund (the \"Fund\") . This novel approach to antipoverty advocacy was initially supported by s tate and national philanthropic foundations . Only later, after the EOA was crafted to follow the Fund's model, did the Fund distribute federal dollars.257 Professor Tara Melish focuses blame for the demise of the EOA's MFP mandate \u2014and for much of the antipathy toward the War on Poverty \u2014on the \"increasingly belligerent, extreme, and confrontational demands\" of welfare rights activists for resource redistribution.258 Professors Robert R. Korstad and James L. Leloudis describe a more complex set of tensions at work in North Carolina. Their research shows that MFP drew consistent fire from the outset as white supremacists, farm and business owners, local governments, and nonprofits \u2014with varied motives\u2014 resisted t he mandate , finding it a direct challenge to their power and authority. 259 Such reactions, as well as the Fund's deliberately limited time span, cabined antipoverty and racial justice work in North Carolina. The movements took another hit when new federal ta x laws restricted philanthropic foundations from supporting work that could be construed as political (including education and organization involving voter registration drives) and made the restrictions enforceable through large monetary fines against not only the foundations but also their employees and board members. 260 The triple whammy landed with elimination, reallocation, and privatization of governmental support programs for poor people in the 1990s.261 Thus, even before the 2008 recession, North Carolina consistently ranked among the lowest ten states, near Texas and Mississippi, for per -pupil spending on 253 Id. at 317. 254 Id. at 317 -18. 255 Id. at 316 -18. 256 Id. at 166 -67, 306, 340- 41. 257 Id. at 172 -73. 258 Tara J.

Recent developments are typical of national trends. In 2010, millions of dollars from inside and outside the state were targeted to seat the first Republican - majority North Carolina General Assembly since Reconstruction.269 The state legislature promptly began to cut taxes and spending,270 and enacted what one expert called \"the largest and most restrictive\" cluster of voting regulations since passage of the federal Voting Rights Act fifty years ago.271 Those initiatives track 262 Compare U.S. CENSUS BUREAU , PUBLIC EDUCATION FINANCES : 2008, at 8 tbl.8 (2010) (showing only si x states with less per -pupil spending), available at http://www2. census.gov/govs/school/08f33pub.pdf, with U.S. CENSUS BUREAU , PUBLIC EDUCATION FINANCES : 2010, at 8 tbl.8 (2012) (same), available at http://www2.census.gov/govs/school /10f33pub.pdf. 263 GENE NICHOL & HEATHER HUNT, CTR.

IV. REFORM , REACTION , AND RESILIENCE : AN UNLIKELY CONSTELLATION OF CUTTING -EDGE CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORMS North Carolina's complex and often violent history makes the state a surprising site for cutting -edge criminal justice reforms, which this Part sorts into three categories. Th e first involves \"innocentric\" efforts to identify and reduce wrongful convictions. The second targets efficiency and cost reductio n. These reforms are laudatory. Several directly redress power disparities that undermine system fairnes s, reliability, and l egitimacy. But it is the third category of reform that more directly addresses the democracy deficit at the intersection of crime, race, and poverty. This category include s early intervention programs such as Nurse -Family Partnership (NFP) programs , which are designed at least in part to increase capacities for resilience and self -governance and to reduce criminal offending and victimization. Within the machinery of the criminal justice systems, two examples are North Carolina 's Indigent Defense Ser vices system and the state's Racial Justice Act. The former strengthens a defendant's role and voice in case processing , and t he latter vindicated the rights of black jurors to participate in capital cases. The foregoing categorization of North Carolina's reforms is not hard and fast ; motivations for these reforms overlap and vary. Their abilities to withstand reaction and repeal are also mixed . A. Innocentric Reforms As indicated in the Introduction, the experiences of Inhofe and Stevens are linked to Thompson's by a single factor: the need of an accused to access the prosecuting authority's investigative file in order to mount a full and fair defense. Prior scholarship describes North Carolina's pioneering full open- file discovery reform. 273 That reform is a broadly democracy -enhancing tool. As Inhofe realized when \"it happened to [him],\"274 access to that information helps to level the playing field between a defendant and the concentrated power of a charging and prosecuting authority. Full open- file disc overy cannot compensate for prosecutors' superior investigative resources and ability to select the number and level of charges against a particular defendant. But access to the full investigative file can empower http://www.justice.gov/usao/ncm/news/2013/20130930_US_v_NC.pdf , which challenges voting restrictions imposed by, for example , N.C. GEN. STAT. \u00a7\u00a7163 to 166.13 -14 (2013)). 272 See WENDY WEISER & DIANA KASDAN , BRENNAN CTR.

A defendant's decision to enter a plea or exercise the right to trial is more likely to be fully informed and voluntary when the defendant knows the strengths and weaknesses of the state's case. In the minority of cases that go to trial, full ope n-file discovery helps to ensure that the defendant's voice is heard through the full and fair airing of the evidence. Fact finders, who speak for the community either as elected judges in bench trials or as jurors exercising a quintessentially democratic check on concentrated government power, are likewise more fully able to undertake deliberations with confidence and issue reliable judgments. Thus, discovery reform enhances democracy while simultaneously promoting efficiency and finality of case processin g and verdicts. 275 Full open- file discovery also spun off additional pioneering reforms in North Carolina. Newly opened prosecution files revealed still more wrongful convictions in a number of high -profile cases.276 Two types of responsive innocentric reforms bolstered full open- file mandates by seeking to prevent erroneous convictions. First, the state pioneered the creation of an independent Innocence Inquiry Commission to investigate and correct wrongful convictions.277 Second, North Carolina joined t he minority of states undertaking reform of fore nsic investigation procedures. 1. The Innocence Commission North Carolina's Innocence Inquiry Commission (IIC) is the only state agency in the country with the authority to refer prisoners with colorable innocence claims to court for potential exoneration and release. 278 As was the case with mandatory statewide full open- file discovery reform, implementation of the new IIC statutes led to another spate of high -profile exonerations.279 There also was predictabl e pushback. Prosecutors unsuccessfully sought to bar IIC claims by prisoners who plead guilty or no contest , to restrict sources of IIC referrals, to expand prosecutors' adversarial participation in IIC proceedings , and to trim witness immunity protections.280 The legislature rejected these 275 See Moore, supra note 13, at 1371 -72, 1377. 276 Id. at 1379 & n.360. 277 North Carolina Innocence Inquir y Commission Act, N.C.

Their practical effect is open to question. The first amendme nt helps to guarantee victims a place at the table . Increased transparency improves procedural justice. New information can change victim s' perceptions about defendants' guilt.283 But victims who are not called as witnesses or otherwise engaged by the IIC's investigation and review process may be frustrated by the real or perceived inability to shape the outcome. This limitation is driven by the uniquely nonadversarial structure of the IIC's investigative and first -tier decision - making processes.284 With respec t to the second amendment, some defendants might strengthen either a pretrial innocence claim or plea bargaining position by pointing to the compensation exclusion as warranting concessions from the prosecution. But given the institutional pressures facing charged defendants, 285 including pressures on overloaded defense attorneys,286 it is unlikely that many defendants will know that this exclusion is an automatic collateral consequence of any guilty plea. It is more likely that the exclusion will operate as intended: as complete ly barring compensation for anyone who pleads guilty but whom the IIC reveals to be a victim of wrongful imprisonment. Thus, the amendment exacerbates the power disparities that drive the plea process and yield wrongful convictions in the first place. ls/House/PDF/H778v1.pdf .

Among other things, previously unknown records demonstrated that SBI employees had provided biased or false testimony favoring the prosecution. 292 Responsive legislation created an independent state- oversight authority and specified quali fication and evaluation standards to increase transparency and accountability.293 The full open- file discovery statutes were amended to specifically require disclosure not only of forensic test results but also of all underlying or preliminary notes and results.294 Legislators also created the position of forensic science ombudsman, tasked to work with all stakeholders including \"the general public to ensure all processes, procedures, practices, and protocols at the State Crime Laboratory are consistent with St ate and federal law, best forensic law practices, and in the best interests of justice in this State.\"295 287 Norris et al., supra note 277, at 1318 . 288 N.C.

To the astonishment of many, the forme r judge in charge of the SBI's reformation refused to give prosecutors the test results of individual forensic examiners.300 Instead of complying with Brady , the judge insisted that the information was protected by a personnel records exception.301 The prosecutors subpoenaed the information, and the SBI was forced to reveal it.302 That remarkable turn in North Carolina's innocentric reforms may illustrate the long -term power of litigation and legislation to change the internal culture of prosecutorial offices.303 These reforms also enhance democracy at the most granular level.

Focusing on the Bottom Line 1. The Sentencing Commission and Justice Reinvestment North Carolina's sentencing commission is viewed as a model in part because it has the largest and most diverse membership of any sentencing commission in the country, ensuring that \"[v]irtually every conceivable interest is represented.\"306 But the commission was not exemplary solely because of its structure. It was the \"linchpin\" connecting penal politics with a fiscal bottom line.307 By fulfilling a legislative mandate to conduct impact analyses on pending legislation, the commission helped to reduce the state's incarceration rate from the highest in the nation to near the national average. 308 As discussed in Part II.B.2, convergent interests around cost cutting carry reformers only so far. In the 1980s, North Carolina faced significant increases in prison and jail populations, with correspondingly grim budget implications.309 The commission did not stop North Carolina from riding the nationwide wave of budget -busting \"three strikes\" mandatory sentences.310 As a result, North Carolina became one of seventeen states to participate in the Council of State Governments' Justice Reinvestment initiative \u2014again w ith predictably mixed results. The original vision of justice reinvestment entailed redirection of money spent on criminal cases and incarceration to rebuild \"the schools, healthcare facilities, parks, and public spaces [] of neighborhoods devastated by high levels of 304 Daniel S.

Collateral Consequences North Carolina is also one of a handful of states to tackle the jungle of collateral consequences that block access to the jobs, housing, education, and transportation that released prisoners need to reintegrate successfully into their communities. 313 But the state has yet to follow the lead of other jurisdictions by eliminating collateral consequences outright or \"banning the box\" to limit potential employers' access to applicants' criminal histories.314 Instead, North Carolina joined the very small group of states that grant certificates of rehabilitation to people with conviction s who meet specified criteria that predict successful reentry.315 The corresponding state law also has been cited as a national model for limiting civil liability for employers who hire people with criminal records, should that hiring decision cause future h arm.316 Both of these mechanisms are viewed as reducing barriers to employment. Finally, the state is one of only two in the country to have constructed a collateral consequences database through which defendants and complaining witnesses as well as prosecut ors, defense attorneys, and judges can become fully aware of the collateral costs and benefits of specific charges, plea offers, and sentences. 317 311 Nkechi Taifa & Catherine Beane, Integrative Solutions to Interrelated Issues: A Multidisciplinary Look Behind the Cycle of Incarceration, 3 HARV.

Human Beings and Citizens: Isomoiria and Democracy Enhancement The foregoing constellation of reforms addresses the mechanics of criminal justice systems as traditionally conceived. A democracy -enhancing theory of criminal law and procedure should address causal factors driving the disproportionate representation of low -income and minority individuals in criminal justice systems\u2014whether as crime victims, offenders, or, as is too often the case, individuals with dual victim/offender identities. Bannister traces the cradle- to- prison pipeline that disproportionately funnels low -income African American children, particularly boys, from low literacy levels in racially and socioeconomically segregated early elementary school settings to dropping out in middle or early high school, then into juveni le systems and on to contact with criminal law and procedure as adults. 318 Nobel Prize -winning economist and law professor James Heckman reports that early intervention programs divert those pipelines by empowering families to improve their own prenatal care , parenting and communication skills, health and nutrition, and literacy. 319 Available data indicate that these programs reduce the risk of offending while conserving increasingly scarce tax dollars.320 Conversely, Civil Impacts of Criminal Convictions Under Ohio Law , CIVICC OHIO.ORG, http://opd.ohi o.gov/civicc (last visited Apr. 3, 2014).

(Drug Abuse Re sistance Education) and Scared Straight appear to have no effect or may even cause harm.321 Heckman describes successful early intervention as investment in human capital. Those initiatives are as readily viewed as enhancing individual and community self -governance.322 The related empirical data hold promise for a democracy -enhancing approach to criminal law and procedure. Democracy enhancement at those levels can reduce the risk of criminal justice involvement before the mill begins its crushing cycle of offense and victimization, arrest, charge, conviction, incarceration, reentry, and recidivism.323 As Professor Heckman explains, \"Skill formation is a life cycle process. It starts in the womb and goes on throughout life. . . . [T]he traditional debate about nature versus nurture is scientifically obsolete.\"324 When these capacities develop early on, they simultaneously \"raise[] skill attainment at later stages\" and \"facilitate[] the productivity of lat er investment.\" 325 The mutually reinforcing relationship of these capacities frees early investment in hum an development of any \"equity- efficiency trade- off.\"326 A number of early- intervention programs have been tested over time in terms of their payoff in red ucing the risk of criminal justice involvement.327 One top- performing example is the Nurse -Family Partnership ( NFP).328 The program pairs a registered nurse with low -income, first -time mothers during pregnancy and for the first two years of the baby's life.329 321 Soler et al., supra note 320, at 491- 92. 322 Cf.

Further research is needed to determine the extent to which NFP's commitment to voluntary and mutually respectful relationships between nurses and mothers prevents the degradation critiqued by Khiara M. 2014] DEMOCR ACY ENHANCEMENT 595 Economists at the RAND Corporation calculated that each dollar invested in NFP involvement with a high -risk family saves more than five dollars in social services, health care, and criminal justice expenditures.330 One might fruitfully compare the economic im pact of early intervention and prevention with the cost of processing criminal cases \u2014the bulk of which are low -level misdemeanors.331 Accounting solely for personnel and physical -plant investments, an estimate from one jurisdiction concluded that flooding courtrooms with these cases is the criminal justice equivalent of swamping intensive care units with nosebleeds \u2014at a cost to taxpayers of approximately $40,000 per hour.332 North Carolina has promoted NFP in association with a twenty -year-old state legislative initiative called Smart Start.333 Established in 1993, Smart Start is a multipronged strategy to improve life outcomes by increasing low -income children's preparation for kindergarten. \" We want to develop their brains. We want them to start school healthy a nd ready to learn,\" explained then- Governor Jim Hunt.334 Because NFP is an evidence- based model, fidelity to program design and structure is a prerequisite for accreditation. North Carolina was approved to begin an NFP program in one county in 2000 and has s ince expanded to 10 of the state's 100 counties.335 That rate of expansion belies claims of social scientists that \"the public is nearly universal in its support for early intervention\u2014so much so that 'child saving' can be considered a core cultural belief. \"336 Moreover, despite investing in early empowerment through Smart Start, and despite overall improving test scores, North Carolina still ranks fourth from the bottom among states for SAT scores. 337 The state also ranks second highest for teenage dropout rate s.338 Bridges, Privacy Right s and Public Families , 34 H ARV.

He was prescient in predicting that continued support would be uncertain in harder times despite the fact that \"it is during periods of economic stag nation and high unemployment that the program of this kind is needed most.\"339 Smart Start has come under repeated attack in recent years, including cuts to its $300 million annual state funding. T he 2008 economic crisis also did not spare the foundations that have supported North Carolina's NFP programs from the outset.340 2. Indigent Defense Services The \"basic facts\" linking poverty with harm to healthy human development are \"increasingly well known.\" 341 So too is the failure of \"political will\" in the United States \"to invest in programs that work\" and address the \"moral scandal\" of the highest child poverty rate in the Western industrialized world by bringing those rates in line with nations averaging \"between one eighth and one half\" that rate. 342 As these policy decisions feed predictable patterns of criminal victimization and offending, the public defender occupies a unique role in the struggle for expanded self-governance. This role's \"peculiar sacredn ess\" derives from the duty to give voice to and vindicate the interests of the disproportionately low -income and minority individuals who face government prosecution. 343 Despite recent attacks on its independence, North Carolina's Indigent Defense Services (IDS) system remains relatively well positioned to fulfill this role. The state enjoys one of the better -developed public defender programs in the country. Four components of the state's Indigent Defense Act have been critical. The first three fulfilled the American Bar Association's Ten Prin ciples of a Public Defense Delivery System , widely acknowledged as establishing best practice standards for structuring indigent defense.344 First, at the statutes' inception , their express purpose prioritized quality of service and independence of counsel.345 Second, that independence was secured through system governance by a relatively broad- based commission that was not 339 Olds et al., supra note 329, at 288. 340 See Hunt Back for Smart Start , supra note 333 (describing 2011 budget negotiations and conservative criticism of Smart Start's \"wasting money\" and \"overpaid\" leadership). 341 J.

These resources create communities of knowledge and support among lawyers in various specialty areas. 351 In addition to offering a rich intellectual, practical, and emotional resource for practit ioners struggling with demanding caseloads, this communications network reciprocally helps IDS administrators respond to concerns of lawyers in the trenches. In terms of more traditional exercises of oppositional politics, the statewide IDS communications network also keeps the public defense bar alert and responsive to pending legislative changes\u2014but apparently with diminishing effect. For example, recent cost -cutting and \"tough on crime\" legislati on require s low-bid contracting of public defense services, and transferred ultimate responsibility for evaluating quality of contract service from IDS to elected local judges. 352 The 346 See id. \u00a7 7A -498.4. 347 Id. \u00a7\u00a7 7A -498.5 to .6.

The Racial Justice Act As the foregoing discussion makes clear, few of North Carolina's cutting - edge reforms attack the roots of the concentrated disadvantage and democracy deficit that mark the intersection of race, crime, and poverty. 356 There are noteworthy exceptions, however. The president of the North Carolina Conference of District Attorneys has publicly \"highlight[ed] a great social issue that has been years in the making and is bigger than any of us: race and justice and disproportionate minority contact with the criminal justice system.\"357 Professors Marc Miller and Ronald Wright also note that the prosecutor in North Carolina's largest city was one of a select few in the nation to participate in an internal self - assessment designed to detect the influence of racial bias, whether implicit or conscious, in prosecutorial decision making. 358 In addition, Professors Mosteller , Grosso, and O'Brien have highlighted the state's innovative Racial Justice Act (RJA).

Ken tucky360 and to capitally charged defendants under McClesky v. Kemp ,361 in part by allowing defendants to prove the existence and effect of bias through statistical evidence.362 Thus, t he RJA also expanded upon the only prior statutory model from Kentucky.363 Finally, the RJA was the first law of any kind to result in judicial findings , in State v. Robinson,364 that a death penalty system was infected by the intentional, statewide, race -based discrimination by prosecutors against African Americans in jury selection.365 Two months after Robinson , the state legislature overrode a gubernatorial veto of amendments that gutted key RJA provisions.366 Nevertheless, the Robinson findings were reinforced by a second RJA order vacating three more death sentences under the amended s tatutes . 367 The presiding judge again found that prosecutors had discriminated against prospective African American jurors on the basis of race. 368 Such discrimination, the court held, \"is at war with our basic concepts of a democratic society and representati ve government.\"369 The court expressed hope that acknowledging \"the ugly truth of race discrimination\" in the selection of capital jurors would help to realize \"our ideal of equal justice under the law.\" 370 359 See North Carolina Racial J ustice Act, N.C.

The rulings are noteworthy for other reasons as well . The court found, consistent with the first RJA order, that regression analysis revealed race- based disparate treatment of prospective jurors by prosecutors to be a significant factor in the imposition of the defendants' death sentences.371 As required by the amended statute, the second RJA order was not based on statistical evidence alone. Instead , the second RJA order was \"based primarily on the words and deeds of the prosecutors\" constituting \"powerful evidence of race consciousness and race- based decision making.\"372 The prosecution provided what the court found to be the most compelling evidence o f the prosecutors' own intentional discrimination. One prosecutor undercut the S tate's case by committing perjury during the RJA hearing itself.373 Other prosecutorial \"words and deeds\" included a \"Top Gun\" training program sponsored by the state Conference of District Attorneys, which promoted strategies to avoid Batson's already weakly enforceable strictures against race- based peremptory strikes.374 Prosecutors also offered what the trial court found to be \"patently irrational, nonsensical\" justifications for striking African Americans from venires. These included prospective jurors' military service, affiliation with the state government, and church attendance. 375 Yet another set of prosecutorial \"words and deeds\" bring s this discussion full circle by linking the RJA litigation with North Carolina's prior pioneering reform of full open- file discovery. These \"words and deeds\" comprised prosecutors ' notes, which documented the consideration of race in the exercise of jury strikes against African Americans. The no tes were \"long buried in the case files and brought to light for the first time \" at the RJA hearing. 376 They were not \"brought to light\" because prosecutors complied with the court's RJA discovery order, which required the information's disclosure to the def ense. Instead , the information had been identified and preserved through a prior, independent defense investigation made possible by mandatory, statewide full open -file discovery statutes. 377 The RJA rulings are hardly the end of this particular democracy -enhancement story. They came at a cost to murder victims' survivors who saw execution as just punishment despite the race -based elimination of prospective jurors.378 In April 371 Id. at 136 -201. 372 Id. at 3, 112 -20. 373 Id. at 80. 374 Id. at 4-5, 73- 77. 375 Id. at 121 -24. 376 Id. at 3; see also id. at 50 n.5 (stating that disappearance of prosecutor's notes from file \"could easily be construed to support the inference that the State intentionally destroyed [the m]\" but declining to so find due to sworn testimony by local judges regarding the prosecutor's \"excellent reputation for truthfulness and integrity\"). 377 See id. at 47, 50 & n.5 (discussing 2006 investigation of postconviction counsel); State v.

Constellation Mapping and Circumspection To map the foregoing constellation of laws and policies in North Carolina is to reveal cycles of reform, reaction, retrenchment, and repeal that warrant considerable circumspection. O ther states may achieve similar or better outcomes throug h other means. North Carolina also has failed to fully exploit all available reform opportunities. A salient example relates to the nationally publicized decision of Governor Beverly P erdue to issue pardons of innocence for a group of civil rights and anti poverty activists known as \"The Wilmington Ten.\"382 Perdue issued the pardons just before leaving office in January 2013, but t he cases arose forty years earlier. The defendants were convicted of firebombing a white -owned grocery store in North Carolina's l argest port city \u2014the site of the infamous Wilmington Massacre during the white supremacy campaign of the 1890s.383 The grocery store fire occurred amid protests over the closure of the local African American high school and dispersal of the black students to white schools.384 The cases of the Wilmington Ten, like other cases that ultimately motivated North Carolina's enactment of mandatory statewide full open -file criminal discovery,385 involved years of postconviction litigation and a federal appellate court vacating the convictions based on Brady violations.386 The Fourth Circuit reached the \"inescapable\" conclusion that the Wilmington Ten prosecutor knew his key witness committed perjury and suppress ed the witness' s contradictory prior statement from the defense (along with other material exculpatory evidence). 387 Yet the taint of prior conviction and imprisonment still hung over the Wilmington Ten until Perdue issued the pardons of innocence. The g overnor's signing state ment cited the recantation of prior witnesses as a reason for issuing the rdicts/ (describing the departure from the courtroom of the widow of murdered highway patrol Sergeant Ed Lowry and uniformed officers, who had filled \"over three -fourths of the courtro om,\" as the judge read the order entitling the defendants to reduced sentences). 379 State v.

But the signing statement also emphasized newly di scovered evidence that the prosecutor relied on race in jury selection.388 The g overnor decried the latter conduct as utterly incompatible with basic notions of fairness and with every ideal that North Carolina holds dear. The legitimacy of our criminal justice system hinges on it operating in a fair and equitable manner . . . not based on race or other forms of prejudice. . . . [T]hese convictions were tainted by naked racism and represent an ugly stain on North Carolina's criminal justice system that cannot be allowed to stand any longer. 389 Perdue was not alone in condemning the infection of criminal proceedings with racially biased juror exclusion. She was joined by Wilmington's prosecutor \u2014 the same man who , as president -elect of the state Conference of District Attorneys, publicly called for innovative responses to \"a great social issue that has been years in the making and is bigger than any of us: race and justice.\" 390 The prosecutor was quoted as saying, When jurors are excluded from the judicial process on the basis of race . . . the defendant and the entire com munity are denied a fair trial. . . . Where, as here, the process that was in place to search for the truth is determined to be so fundamentally flawed that we cannot know it, the verdict cannot stand the test of time.391 Such statements might have inspired hope that the RJA orders finding statewide infection of capital jury selection with comparable race bias would inspire gubernatorial disapprobation and even conversion of existi ng death sentences to RJA -mandated sentences of life imprisonment without parole. At minimum, such sentiments might have been expected to stem the tide toward the RJA's repeal. Future research should explore the reasons why such aspirations were so completely thwarted. Some preliminary thoughts are offered here. First, the cases of the Wilmington Ten and the RJA litigants stood in a very different procedural posture. For the former, forty years of litigation and extrajudicial advocacy revealed the unfairness under settled federal constitutio nal law, and the factual wrongfulness , of the convictions and sentences. In contrast, when the governor issued the Wilmington Ten pardons, the ink was barely dry on the RJA amendments, orders, and petitions for appellate review \u2014none of which 388 The local newspaper published the full text of the governor's signing statement, which was deleted from the gubernatorial website after Perdue left office.

Second, as the foregoing analysis of North Carolina's criminal justice reforms demonstrates, change is seldom insulated from reaction and repeal. It was precisely the effectivene ss of the RJA's direct, systemic assault on the infection of race bias in capital cases that proved to be the statute's undoing. Other categorical interventions to halt executions have had mixed long- term results, including backlash against judicial, execu tive, and legislative decision makers and increased support for capital punishment.392 Put bluntly, the RJA jumped on the political third rail at the intersection of crime, race, and poverty. The foregoing analysis also makes clear that while several of Nort h Carolina's pioneering reforms resulted from litigation and legislation, none exemplifies direct input or leadership from the low -income and minority individuals who are disproportionately affected by crime and criminal justice systems. Certainly these reforms appear to level the playing field. One or two could be cast as fundamentally concerned with democracy enhancement. But with the exception of the Innocence Inquiry Commission and the R JA, support has been deeply rooted in arguments for efficiency \u2014the wise stewardship of increasingly scarce tax dollars. One need not share Derrick Bell's suspicion toward interest convergence, Matthew Adler's critique of cost -benefit analysis, or Iris Marion Young's commitment to democracy as fully participatory communicati ve action to seek a more sustainable theoretical grounding for criminal justice reform. Viewed through the lens of a democracy- enhancement theory discussed in Part II, therefore, North Carolina's reforms pres ent a decidedly mixed picture. The next Part digs below the surface to examine the state's institutional culture in light of the outlines of a democracy -enhancement theory, probing for causal explanations behind the constellation of cutting -edge criminal justice reforms and their occasional resilien ce against reaction and repeal. To that end, Part V focuses particularly on the institutionalization of capacities for critical reflection and action through oppositional politics. V. DEMOS , DELIBERATORS , AND DEFENDERS Mixed motives sparked North Caroli na's constellation of cutting -edge criminal justice reforms. Initiatives driven by concerns for fairness or involving significant resource redistribution \u2014whether that redistribution targets economic, human, or social capital, including the prerogatives of white privilege \u2014have been less resilient in the face of reaction and repeal than those with more immediately obvious cost -benefit payoffs. The search in this Part is for replicable conditions that promote sustainable reform, particularly conditions that en able jurisdictions to embed self -reflective capacities within processes for criminal justice policy making and implementation. 392 See, e.g. , Kelly Holthus en, How to Argue for Your Life in Fifteen Minutes or Less: An Analysis of Illinois Governor Ryan's Clemency Review Boards , 30 N EW ENG.

Key , Jr. correctly noted that North Carolina's then- nascent oppositional politics had the potential to grow from the ground up.393 The state's geography is trifurcated between the Appalachian M ountains, the Piedmont, and the sea. In parallel fashion, economic interests were historically divided among a relatively small slave- owning plantation elite in the east, small farmers in the center of the state, and a historically poorer and more isolated mountain population. As discussed in Part III, the post -Reconstruction white supremacy campaigns, the violent imposition of one -party rule, and Jim Crow repression coincided with concentrating power in the tobacco and textile manufacturing industries, rapidly expanding banking interests, and the development of a small group of highly influential law firm s. In Key's description, from North Carolina's inception, the state's regional economic interests created \"more- tender sectional sensibilities than any other state in the South . . . . \" 394 But m ost states can claim geographic, economic and political divisions that will be viewed as significant by the people who have to navigate them. Likewise, opposition between conservative, business -oriented factions and populist undercurrents is commonplace. A number of states also have greater racial and ethnic diversity than North Carolina. A recent spike in Latino immigration has reduced the non- Hispanic white population to 65% while the black population has remained fairly consistent at just under 25% of the population.395 Nevertheless, both before and after the Red Shirt revolution, the African American population in North C arolina enjoyed strong, well -educated, business - oriented, politically active leadership.396 During the Jim Crow era, blacks developed independent institutional structures in addition to business and schools \u2014\"churches, newspapers, fraternal lodges, and women' s clubs\" \u2014and hammered out new coalitions with partners inside and outside the state.397 Those resources provided a foundation for oppositional politics in the most recent C ivil Rights era and beyond. Exemplary leaders include nationally renowned historian John Hope Franklin as well as leading civil rights attorneys such as Julius L. Chambers and James E. Ferguson II .398 As Professors O'Brien and Grosso explain, 393 See KEY, supra note 177, at 218 -28. 394 Id. at 219. 395 See KORSTAD & LELOUDIS , supra note 188, at 311; State and County QuickFacts: North Carolina, U.S. CENSUS BUREAU (last revised Mar. 2 7, 2014 ), http://quickfacts.censu s.gov/qfd/states/37000.html. 396 See, e.g. , KORSTAD supra note 188, at 81, 189 -90 (discussing black leadership in Durham). 397 ALDON D.

Deliberators Despite the state's halting progress on education, there is at least one distinctive example of an \"honest broker\" deliberative function served by a public university in the context of criminal law and procedure. Professors at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 's School of Government evaluate and interpret legislation and case law as part of their duties in training prosecutors, judges, and indigent defense attorn eys from all corners of the state's unified court system. Because institutions and individual actors are mutually constitutive, 400 leadership development is critical. Critiques of criminal justice systems, agencies, and agents often emphasize the powerful im pact of institutional culture on stakeholders' identity formation, including through the shaping of next -generation leadership (whether intentional or unintentional) .401 It appears that relatively few states have similar evaluation, interpretation, training and research functions that are embedded in their local universities and focused on criminal law and procedure. 402 Foundations and nonprofits also provide some institutionally independent space to improve the quality of deliberation and decision making on issues of criminal law and procedure. As discussed in Part IV.A, Key and other scholars overstate the scope and direction of North Carolina's progress on education.403 There is bitter irony in the fact that one of the state's leading white supremacists simultaneously oversaw the violent overthrow of elected Fusionist governments, the development of Jim Crow, and the biggest investment in the state's history to improve public education for both black and white students. Significantly, it was investments from northern foundations that supported the white supremacist movement's \"school -building campaign of staggering proportions: during the period 1902-10, the state erected on average more than one new schoolhouse a day.\" 404 civil rights leader and litigator of key cases in both s chool desegregation and employment discrimination); Lawyer Limelight: James E.

Like other states, North Carolina has a long history of such public -private partnerships. In the antebellum, Reconstruction, and Jim Crow eras, black leaders tapped northern philanthropists and mission societies to build educational and business infrastructure. 405 As noted above, a white supremacist governor used foundation funds to support a school -building campaign in the first part of the twentieth century. In the early 1960s, then- Governor Terry Sanford obtained funding from the Ford Foundation, as well as North Carolina's Z. Smith Reynolds and Mary Reynolds Babcock f oundations, for a homegrown War on Poverty.406 The resulting North Carolina Fund became a model for the federal War on Poverty, particularly in emphasizing maximum feasible participation by low -income and minority individuals and communities in program development, implementation, and oversight. 407 As discussed in Part III, the Fund saw limited success, but African American leadership (both grassroots and elite) was critical to the Fund's creation and accomplishments. 408 Local philanthropists have continued to support research on the concentrated disadvan tage that exists at the intersection of crime, race, and poverty. For example, the Z. Smith Reynolds F oundation recently provided support to the School of Government to create the state's pioneering web-searchable collateral consequences database. 409 In the wake of negative reaction by prosecutors and the public to litigation under the R JA, the Fund also support s the development of training materials for justice system personnel on detecting and eliminating racial bias from criminal proceedings.410 C.

To be sure, other jurisdictions have unified defender systems,414 excellent defender training programs,415 and partnerships between the criminal defense and plaintiffs' bars.416 But North Carolina appears to be a fairly rare example where these factors coincide. As noted in Part IV.C.2, other crucial components of effective indigent defense refor m include the capacities to establish and enforce statewide standards for attorney qualification, performance, and workload; create and maintain statewide training and listserv programs that empower attorneys to meet those standards and demand the resources necessary to do so; and collect, assess, and use statewide data on outcomes in promoting system improvements. Access to data is enhanced where, as in North Carolina, the state has merged case processing into a statewide, unified court system. Although fa r from comprehensive, such data collection and assessment capacities are prerequisites to politically effective action based on fairness, transparency, accountability, and efficiency. 417 At the back end, statutes permit self -correction of indigent defense se rvice failures by allowing investigat ion and litigat ion of postconviction motions involving ineffective assistance on direct appeal instead of being limited to local trial courts.418 North Carolina also has benefited from pockets of strong investigative reporting by major media outlets. Detailed analysis of wrongful convictions has played an especially critical role in expanding public awareness of 412 See Wright, Parity , supra note 80, at 231-42 (describing successful state legislative efforts to balanc e prosecutorial and defense resources through parity assessment); see also Moore, supra note 13, at 1378 79 (describing the role of the defense bar in shaping legislative history of full open -file discovery). 413 See O'Brien & Grosso, supra note 359, at 486 -87. 414 Colorado, Montana, and New Hampshire are examples. 415 Kentucky's Department of Public Advocacy, the Public Defender Services of Washington, D.C., and Colorado's Public Defender s ystem are examples. 416 North Carolina Advocates for Justice and Arizona Attorneys for Criminal Justice are two organizations that join attorneys across practice areas.

Diversity and Deep Analogies The foregoing discussion does not exhaust prerequisites for creating and sustaining oppositional politics in the context of criminal law and procedure. Nor are the highlighted institutional factors idiosyncratic to any single jurisdiction. Moreover, any circumstance that supports oppositional politics in the context of criminal law and procedure must be augmented with vision, opportunism, and tenacity. There also must be cracks in the mortar that open up wiggle room for \"political entrepreneurs.\" 420 Another characteristic that helps to drive and sustain reform is diversity within institutions, a s well as the embedding of institutions themselves in broader \"networks that crosscut important . . . boundaries.\"421 Professors O'Brien and Grosso describe how networking across diversity occurred in movements leading to enactment of the R JA.422 Successful articulation and implementation of new policies also may require \"deep analogies to already institutionalized models or widely held norms.\"423 On this point, North Carolina's strikingly Janus -faced sociopolitical and legal histor ies serve as unlikely resources for the long -haul work of expanding democracy at the intersection of cr ime, race, and poverty. It may be that the state's progressive self - conception\u2014a mythos inscribed in scholarship as early as Key's Southern Politics \u2014is itself an important catalyst. That mythology may moderate reaction and lower the activation energy requi red to initiate change. The state's progressive sociopolitical subtext is discernible even in recent events. The May 2012 Klan rally outside Harmony, North Carolina , may have drawn more protesters than participants.424 In response to the pardon of the Wilmin gton Ten, due in part to the past prosecutor's race -based discrimination during jury selection, the current prosecutor stated publicly that such conduct denies both defendant s and the community a fair trial.425 In addition, \"Moral Monday\" protests against th e recent conservative legislative agenda have drawn 419 See, e.g. , Joseph Ne ff, Time of Death , RALEIGH NEWS & OBSERVER (Dec. 8, 2002), available at http://web.campbell.edu/faculty/bartlett/Forensic%20Entomology/news observer_com%20%20Series1.htm (covering the wrongful conviction of death row inmate Alan Gell); Phoebe Zerwick , Special Report, Murder, Race, Justice: The State vs. Darryl Hunt , WINSTON -SALEM J., http://www.journalnow.com/app/specialreports/hunt/ (last visited Apr. 3, 2014). 420 Clemens & Cook, supra note 400, at 453. 421 Id.; see also id. at 460 (describing \"multivocality \u2014that fact that single actions can be interpreted coherently from multiple perspectives simultaneously\" as a requirement for \"robust action\") Grosso, 47682. 423 Clemens & Cook, supra note 400, at 457. 424 KKK Hold Rally , supra note 235. 425 Blythe, supra note 391. 2014] DEMOCR ACY ENHANCEMENT 609 national attention, particularly as law professors and pastors join the hundreds of protesters who have been arrested.426 These recent events reveal deep analogies to historic tensions between the state's conservative and progressive movements. Innovation and stability are (often unhappily) wedded. That dialectical tension supports a cautious optimism about the degree to which institutional improvements, particularly those obtained through law, can equalize power disparities without co- opting \"subordinate groups through symbolic displays leaving elite wealth, status, and power in society intact.\" 427 The predictable cycle of action and reaction also grounds a healthy skepticism about the pace if not the overal l trajectory of change. Since \"mobilization from below begets counter -mobilization from above,\"428 policy innovators must be prepared to augment regulation through litigation or legislation with sustained grassroots advocacy. Sometimes \"technically savvy and ideologically committed representatives of the have- nots\" must pull a laboring oar to navigate inevitable backlash. 429 In other words, it is not time to abandon ship. Litigation, legislation, and activism remain viable avenues toward improving lives and systems. Despite predictable reaction and setbacks, the unlikely constellation of pioneering criminal justice reforms in a single jurisdiction should inspire reform advocates to focus and renew their efforts. C ONCLUSION The core question animating this work is a search for sustainable production of the conditions that allow jurisdictions to reduce the footprint of the carceral state and improve criminal justice systems through the traditional clash of law and politics as vitally necessary complements to internal agency reform. The analysis revealed several interesting characteristics of one reform jurisdiction. Vibrant oppositional politics incorporate relatively robust and proactive indigent defense functions. Diverse mec hanisms institutionalize the collection, assessment, and strategic use of criminal justice data. Networking within and across institutions deepens capacities for effective action. Such conditions embed greater opportunities for meaningful self -reflection into discourse on criminal justice issues than can exist in jurisdictions lacking those capacities. Concededly, where such conditions promote opportunities for criminal justice reform, they tend to privilege grasstops over grassroots advocacy and might be dismissed \u2014like Inhofe's Pilot's Bill of Rights \u2014as still more 426 See Anne Blythe, N.C.

Nevertheless, engaged scholarship may enhance attempts to wrest greater transparency and acco untability from concentrated government power \u2014including attempts like Inhofe 's\u2014by expanding avenues toward broader democratic and productive demands for reform. One focus for such additional research is analysis of effective activism by those most directl y affected by crime and criminal justice systems\u2014poor people and people of color. Some justice advocates suggest that defendants and defenders \"crash the system\"\u2014that is, collectively monkeywrench the machinery by refusing plea offers and insisting on taki ng cases to trial.430 Other scholars have noted the work of organizations such as All of Us or None and Families Against Mandatory Minimums. 431 But legal scholars have yet to assess the democracy -enhancing potential, strategies, or influence of other solo and small -organization efforts such as Silicon Valley Debug, which trains families and communities in strategies to improve case outcomes. 432 Innovative peace- making movements such as CeaseFire433 and the Violence Interrupters also hold promise for scholarly investigation,434 as does the grassroots activism of exonerated prisoners like John Thompson. Interdisciplinary action research opportunities also can focus on democracy enhancement through leadership development.435 Readily available avenues include court -watch and data -collection programs. In the specific context of indigent defense reform, Know Your Rights cards and consumer satisfaction surveys can develop experienced consumer -activist leadership to help redress the \"Public Pretender\" conundrum that besets service providers. In the same vein, community- based mediation diversion alternatives empower individuals and neighborhoods with problem -solving and violence -prevention strategies. Through these and other practical applications, scholars and practitioners can concretize a democracy -enhancing theory of criminal law and procedure that empowers the low -income and minority individuals who are most dir ectly and disproportionately affected by the causes and consequences of crime to ask their own policy questions, build their own coalitions, and advocate for their own 430 Alexander, supra note 82. 431 Marsha Weissman, Aspiring to the Impracticable: Alternatives to Incarceration in the Era of Mass Incarceration, 33 N.Y.U.

The ethical obligations of prosecutors faced with such claims , however, have not kept pace . Most efforts within district and U.S. attorneys' offices have been incremental at best, and even those few prosecutors' offices with mo re robust \"conviction integrity units\" \u2014units that affirmatively investigate claims of actual innocence and seek to mitigate the likelihood of wrongful convictions in the first place \u2014suffer from various structural defects. Often a prosecutor 's default posture when faced with a claim of actual innocence is to defend the guilty verdict as quickly and efficiently as possible . There is good reason for prosecu tors to be skeptical of inmate innocence claims . Those prisoners who raise postconviction claims of actual innocence largely lose, and rightfully so; for many, perhaps most, pursuing habeas relief is a matter of routine that follows the exhaustion of appeals . But however understandable prosecutors' skepticism, it comes at a cost: the actually innocent often are grouped together with the frivolous filers and face the same mountain of prosecutorial noncooperation notwithstanding the merits of their claims. This is the new \"prosecutor's dilemma \": how to honor the commitment to doing justice by way of postconvict ion review without wasting precious resources on frivolous petitions. This Article provides a framework to assist prosecutors in separating the actually innocent from the masses of nonmeritorious postconvi ction challenges, and in ratcheting down the prosec utorial zeal reflexively associated with these challenges. The proposed framework, called \"tiered review ,\" takes a pragmatic approach to postconviction review, setting up a multistage process by which prosecutors weed out meritless postconviction petitions early on and then apply increasingly intensive levels of scrutiny to the claims of innocence. Under tiered review , a prosecutor's office investigates a petitioner's innocence claim if that person can point to some new evidence (broadly defined) of * \u00a9 2014 Dana Carver Boehm.

And while the proposal discussed below does not purport, as no prop osal can, to elim inate the prosecution of the innocent entirely or to discover every convicted innocent , it does provide a feasible mechanism whereby prosecutorial zeal and discretion can be directed toward the most ethical and professionally responsible e nds.

CONCLUSION ................................................................................................... 674 INTRODUCTION In D ecember 2011, the Virginia Court of Appeals exonerated forty -six-year- old Thomas Haynesworth, formally acknowledging that he had spent twenty -seven years behind bars for a crime he did not commit. Haynesworth's release from prison was not the direct result of exonerating DNA, an eyewitness recantation, an assertion of a constitutionally deficient trial, or revelations of police or prosecutorial misconduct. Haynesworth's pro bono counsel made a compelling argument for his innocence,1 but as a minority of the Virginia Court of Appeals made clear in a vigorous dissent, Haynesworth almost certainly would not have been found innocent but for the avid support of then -Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, who had affirmatively joined Haynesworth in his petition for a writ of actual innocence.2 Like Cuccinelli, prosecutors across the country have the power and influence to free from prison this country's convicted innocent .3 Nevertheless, in the vast majority of documented exonerations, prosecutors have vigorous ly opposed the habeas petitions of the wrongfully convicted \u2014sometimes for decades\u2014before ultimately agreeing to the prisoners' release, if they ever agree at all.4 1 The Mid -Atlantic Innocence Project and Hogan Lovells US LLP jointly rep resented Haynesworth in his actual innocence peti tion. The Author, then the lead associate of Hogan Lovells' pro bono department, assisted in Haynesworth's case from 2010 to 2011. 2 Haynesworth v. Commonwealth, 717 S.E.2d 817, 818 (Va. Ct. App. 2011) (Elder, J., dissenting) (\"[T]here is no direct evidenc e that exonerates Hayne sworth. The Attorney General has merely expressed his opinion that Haynesworth is innocent.\" (emphasis omitted)). 3 While prosecutors have no statutory authority to order a prison er's release, when the very arm of the state responsib le for the initial imprisonment of that ind ividual renounces its conviction, proclaims that individual's innocence, and seeks that person's release, it stands to reason that courts would not ob ject. 4 See Daniel S. Medwed, The Zeal Deal: Prosecutorial Res istance to Post -Conviction Claims of Innocence , 84 B.U. L. REV. 125, 129 (2004) (\"[P]rosecutors have consented to 616 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 Hayne sworth is not, unfortunately, unique: a recent survey suggests that since 1989, the Uni ted States has seen 873 prisoners exonerated as actually innocent of the crimes for which they were convicted.5 Given that the vast majority of these exonerations are DNA -based, most assume that this number \u2014or any other wrongful conviction estimate \u2014represents only a fraction of those prisoners wrongfully incarcerated.6 If, as is commonly asserted, it is better for some number of guilty to go free than to convict a single innocent person,7 there is a clear need for a mechanism that would help prosecutors dis tinguish meritorious claims of innocence from the unmeritorious. In the face of these conviction errors, it is tempting to blame the pros ecutors. But w hile a natural prosecutorial zeal for maintaining convictions may play a role in the reflexive resistance to actual innocence claims ,8 a far more important and pragmatic reality is at play : prosecutors confront a massive number of postconviction challenges, the overwhelming majority of which are, in fact, frivolous. For every Thomas Haynesworth, there are man y more Ray Dansbys (a convict who claimed actual innocence despite the fact that multiple witnesses, including his son, watched him shoot his ex- wife multiple times at point blank range) 9 and Edwin Marreros (a convict who, after exhausting his appeals and habeas remedies, filed a pro se actual innocence claim that made no real argument DNA tests in less than fifty percent of the cases in which testing later exonerated the inmate.\"). 5 SAMUEL R.

The accuracy of exoneration figures is always somewhat con troversial, particularly where non-DNA cases are included. In some respects, the 873 figure is conservative, as it excludes \"group exonerations\" that have gained widespread public attention and typically involve mass police misconduct, such as those seen i n Tulia, Texas; Dallas, Texas (the \"Sheetrock Scandal\"); and Los Angeles, Cal ifornia (the \"Rampart Scandal\").

This Article prescribes a systematic framework to mitigate the problems associated with the new prosecutor's dilemma, a framework that allows prosecutor's off ices to review actual innocence claims, particularly where DNA evidence is not available.12 Using existing conviction integrity units as a case study, the Article advocates for a postconviction review regime \u2014called \"tiered review\"\u2014 that is structured to fost er innocence seeking, openness, and objectivity and is guided by concrete standards of review that apply to each case and are to be applied by each prosecutor. System atized postconviction review along these lines not only strikes a good balance between prosecutors' ethical obligations and budgetary constraints but also would facilitate consistent review that also is better suited to prosecutors' role as mini sters of justice. The Article proceeds in three Parts. Part I .A analyzes prosecutorial postconviction ethical obligations as presently required by law , specifically 10 See Marrero v. Ives, 682 F.3d 1190, 1192- 93 (9th Cir. 2012). 11 See Russell L. Christopher, The Prosecutor's Dilemma: Bargains and Pu nishment , 72 FORDHAM L. REV. 93, 107- 09 (2003) (referring to the prosecutor's choi ce either to agree not to prosecute a culpable cooperating witness to secure conviction of certain other guilty defendants or to prosecute the potential cooperating witness and lose the ability to prosecute other guilty defendants); Jonathan A.

L.J. 793, 802- 03 (2011) (describing the \"prosecutors' dilemma\" as the quandary prosecutors face in deciding whether to expend the significant resources and logistical challenges inherent in presenting the live analyst testimony now required in cases requiring scientific analysis, or simply not to prosecute many of these cases). 12 This Article focuses largely on the efforts of district attorneys' offices. These prosecutors are responsible for far more criminal prosecutions than t he fe deral government, and many operate in states that offer postconviction remedies based on actual innocence (the Supreme Court has refused to recognize such a claim at the federal level). H. Geoffrey Moulton, Jr. & Daniel C. Richman, Of Prosecutors and Special Prosecutors: An Organizational Perspective , 5 W IDENER L. SYMP. J. 79, 95 (2000). Nevertheless, this Article purposefully uses the broader term \"prosecutors,\" because the ethical o bligations that apply to district attorneys apply equally to federal prosecutors, because these prosecutors encounter the same postconviction challenges (though on a smaller scale, perhaps, given the lack of a judicial remedy), and because in the District of Columbia federal prosecutors do engage in the prosecution of nonfe deral crimes and are obligated to respond to claims under the District of Columbia's actual innocence statute. See Fran Quigley, Torture, Impunity, and the Need for Independent Prosecutorial Oversight of the Executive Branch , 20 CORNELL J.L. & PUB. POL'Y 271, 310 (2010). 618 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 analyzing prosecutors' ethical obligations with regard to their review of actual innocence claims. The latest iteration of the Model Rules has attempted to provide some direction to prosecutor s who face ethical questions regarding convictions already obtained, but the majority of states have no ethical guideline s in this context whatsoever. Part I .B then summarizes the descriptive and prescriptive scholarship on postconviction ethics. Scholars addressing these questions have largely analyzed the cogni tive biases causing prosecutorial resistance to innocence claims, as well as the circumstances under which a prosecutor might affirmatively assist in an inmate's exoneration efforts.13 No one , howeve r, has attempted to develop a decision- making framework for prosecutors' offices to employ in responding to claims of actual innocence. Part II presents five case studies that serve as the partial basis for the tiered review approach described in Part III . Relying on extensive interviews with prosecutors in conviction integrity units in Dallas County, Texas; Harris County, Texas; New York County, New York; Santa Clara Cou nty, California; and Cook County, Illinois, Part II summarizes the lessons to be learn ed from the practice of system atized postconviction review . Part III presents the Article's main practical and intellectual contrib utions: (1) a series of structural changes to the way that postconviction review is co nducted, and (2) the concept of \"tiere d review,\" or the use of a series of concrete standards to assess and respond to claims of actual inn ocence. To counterbalance the natural resistance prosecutors feel toward i nnocence claims, postconviction review must be integrated into the office structu rally, in three ways: (1) a management -level prosecutor must direct the review of innocence claims; (2) the review must be performed by someone other than the original prosecutor; and (3) the office must, with specific exceptions outlined below, cooperate with inmates by opening case files and approving requests for DNA tes ting. These structural changes, however, are incomplete without the concept of tiered review. Under tiered review, a prosecutor assesses whet her a claim meets a particular standard of pr oof before investing further resources in reviewing the claim. The tiers function as follows: T he review of an initial claim of actual innocence is subject to the office's usual protocols, as modified by the structural changes just described. That process will, without more, result in a denial of the claim. However, when a petitioner presents new evidence that introduces a bona fide issue as to the petitioner's inn ocence, the office will investigate that claim . If the investigation demonstrates a \"reasonabl e likelihood of inno cence,\" the o ffice will drop its oppo sition to the claim. And finally, in the event that the investigation yields \"clear and convincing evidence\" that the petitioner was wrongfully convicted, the office will affirmatively support exoner ation for the petitioner . Part IV identifies and responds to counterarguments against investing in postconviction reform, arguing that adoption of the pr oposed structural changes 13 See, e.g. , David Luban, Lecture, The Conscience of a Prosecutor , 45 V AL. U. L. Rev. 1, 16 -17 (2010); Fred C. Zacharias, The Role of Prosecutors in Serving Justice After Convictions , 58 V AND. L. REV. 171, 175 (2005). 2014] THE NEW PROSECUTOR 'S DILEMMA 619 and tiered review are realistic\u2014 and potentially inevitable \u2014prospect s for the majority of prosecutors ' office s. Part IV also shows how postconviction review may be i nstrumental in remedying some of the most serious criminal justice issues for today, including mass incarceration and racial disparities in the criminal justice system. Before proceeding, there are two caveat s. First, w hile tiered review and the associated structural modifications presented here can be applied broadly by prosecutors' offices across the country, the proposals are clearly aspirational in nature. By proposi ng a structure that requires significant additional effort and resources from prosecutors' offices across the country, the proposal likely will be subject to criticism for being overly burdensome. At the same time, by attempting to make the burden of revie wing postconviction actual innocence claims manageable and practicable for prosecutors, it is likely also to be criticized by innocence advocates for being underinclusive in terms of its ability to detect the claims of the convicted innocent. Such is the n ature of proposals aimed at addressing the problem of wrongful conviction. Professor Fred Zacharias, the first scholar to engage the question of postconviction prosecutor ial ethics, observed : At best, one can only hope to identify considerations, reasons, or ways of analyzing appropriate conduct by prosecutors. The absence of legal constraints eliminates the possibility of defining clearly correct, or incorrect, behavior. Similarly, a consensus regarding particularized ethics rules is unlikely to develop. In most cases, the conflict between the presumption of guilt and seemingly \" fair\" prosecutorial conduct is strong, thus rendering any resolution debatable. 14 The resolution proposed below is, without question, debatable. The aim of this Article is not to p rescribe a definitive solution, but to advance the current conversation beyond postconviction prosecutorial ethics and the prosecutor's role in restoring justice to the wrongfully convicted to discussion of the specific steps those prosecutors can and should take in doing so. Second, some may argue that because the number of convicted innocent is relatively small, devoting finite resources to the problem of wrongful conviction is misguided, particularly given the scale of other criminal ju stice problems lik e mass incarceration and racial i njustice. But this argument misses the point. There is no question that mass incarceration is, as William Stuntz called it, \"the criminal justice crisis of our age\"15 and that it disproportionately has impacted the United States' minority populations.16 But these problems are all related. Systematized 14 Zacharias, supra note 13, at 175. 15 WILLIAM J.

As of 2006, black men were six to eight times more likely to be incarcerated than whites, an incarceration t rend that does not appear closely 620 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 postconviction review can lead to broader i mprovements to prosecutorial culture; reorienting prosecutorial culture to justice seeking through use of a postconviction review framework can also benefit larger criminal justice problems, including mass incarceration and racial injustice. Like wrongful conviction, mass incarceration and racial injustice are tied in part to misused prosecutorial authority. While postconviction review is not a magic bullet for either mass incarceration or racial injustice, the improvements to prosecutorial culture that attend that reform have far -reaching consequences for other problems as well. I. PROSECUTORIAL ETHICS AND POST CONVICTION RELIEF Prosec utorial ethics have long been a topic of scholarly discus sion, but in the postconviction context, this discussion has resulted in very few concrete legal rules. Part I.A lays out the law on postconviction ethics , the whole of which amounts to a m odel rule that only eight state bars have adopted . 17 Because so few states have adopted rules on postconviction prosecutorial ethics, most prosec utors are left to rely on their overinvoked but nebulously defined role as \"ministers of justice,\" a role which scholars h ave in recent years parsed closely in the postconviction context. Part I.B outlines the scholarship on prosecutorial postconviction ethical obligations, which is much more developed than the current law: scholars have explored the existence of a prosecuto rial postconviction ethical obligation ,18 investigated why wrongful convictions occur and how they can be avoided,19 and analyzed the specific steps prosecutors should take to remedy existing wrongful correlated with crime rates. See PAUL BUTLER , LET'S GET FREE: A HIP-HOP THEORY OF JUSTICE 31 (2009). 17 As of May 2012, the ABA reports that Idaho adopted Model Rules 3.8(g) and (h) without modification, and Colorado, Delaw are, North Dakota, Tennessee, Washington, and Wisconsin have adopted modified versions of the rule.

A. The Governing Post conviction Ethical Standards Prosecutors' ethical obligations are set forth in federal and state statutes and regulations, the Constitution, case law, and state bar rules of professional conduct;21 but virtually none of these bodies of law impose s any postconviction ethical oblig ations. The exception to this rule is Model Rule 3.8, provisions (g) and (h), which, to date, only eight states have adopted.22 Those provisions are \"standards meant to be the ba re minimum, not to establish the full scope of prosecutors' responsibility.\"23 For prosecutors in all other states , the only postconviction ethical direction is the mandate to act as \"ministers of justice,\"24 a vague duty referenced by the Supreme Court and the Model Rules,25 and one which essentially results in the matter being entirely subject to prosecutorial 20 See, e.g. , CTR.

Unlike most Model Rules amendments, which originate with the American Bar Association, Model Rules 3.8(g) and (h) was the product of \"reasoned debate\" among New York prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges regarding prosecut ors' ethical obligations upon discovery of new evidence that would call into question a convi ction.

As a result , individual prosecutors typically determine what their postconviction ethical obligations are on a case -by-case basis, without the guidelines of a formal ethics rule or, often, clear instruction from their chief prosecutor.26 1. The Baseline for Prosecutorial Postconviction Ethical Obligations: Minimalist Ethical Principles Established by the Model Rules Are a Baseline, Not a Standard Most state bars have chosen to impose no concrete postconviction ob ligations on their prosecutors. 27 Even in those few states whose bars have adopted Model Rule 3.8(g) and (h),28 the requirements imposed on prosec utors are fairly minimal. Indeed, li ke all formal ethics rules, Model Rule 3.8(g) and (h) set a floor of conduct, falling below which may result in professional discipline \u2014not an ethical standard for the virtuous prosecutor to follow. Model R ule 3.8(g) and (h) states , (g) When a prosecuto r knows of new, credible and material evidence creating a reasonable likelihood that a convicted defendant did not commit an offense of which the defendant was convicted, the prosecutor shall: (1) promptly disclose that evidence to an appropriate court or authority, and (2) if the conviction was obtained in the prosecutor's jurisdiction, (i) promptly disclose that evidence to the defendant unless a court authorizes delay, and (ii) undertake further investigation, or make reasonable efforts to cause an investigation, to determine whether the defendant was convicted of an offense that the defendant did not com mit. (h) When a prosecutor knows of clear and convincing evidence establishing that a defendant in the prosecutor's jurisdiction was convicted of an off ense that the defendant did not commit, the prosecutor shall seek to remedy the convi ction.29 26 See Michele K.

ABA REPORT , supra note 17, at 1. 29 MODEL RULES OF PROF'L CONDUCT R. 3.8(g) -(h) (2013). 2014] THE NEW PROSECUTOR 'S DILEMMA 623 Notably, these provisions require no affirmative action on the part of the prosecutor upon mere receipt of a claim of actual innocence. The provisions do not apply at all unless the prosecutor already knows exculpatory information, which must be \"new\" and create \"a reasonable likelihood\" that a defendant was wrongfully convicted. In other words, the prosecutor is under no obligation to affirmatively consider an inm ate's innocence claim, even where a prosecutor strongly suspects (but does not \"know\") that additional evidence may exist that would call that pe rson's conviction into doubt. Nor does it impose an obligation to engage in good -faith, objective review of pos tconviction claims, whether in the habeas or inn ocence context. Instead, these provisions set a \"high threshold\" for prosecutorial postconviction action.30 But \" the disciplinary standard was not intended to imply that when exculpatory evidence does not achi eve that level of significance, it should be ignored.\"31 Rather, proponents of the rule assumed that prosecutors would engage in some degree of scrutiny and investigation in order to explore innocence claims and determine whether the evidence in question wa s significant enough to require disclosure under the rule.32 Thus far , that has not proven true, either in or out of states that have adopted the Model Rule s provisions. Model Rule s provisions 3.8(g) and (h) represent an important step forward in identifyin g that the prosecution does have some obligation following co nviction and in setting a baseline standard of proof for prosecutors to follow when they do encounter potentially exonerating evidence. But they fail to impose any obligation on prosecutors to ac tually review the many claims of innocence that cross their desks or to give those claims anything more than a perfunctory, skept ical review. Although there are no concrete rules mandating good- faith prosecutor ial review of innocence claims, the obligation of prosecutors to serve as \"mi nisters of justice\" would appear to mandate just that type of review. Indeed, while few concrete rules govern prosecutors in the postconviction context, their aspir ational obligation to serve justice lik ely requires more. 2. The Aspirational Role of Prosecutors in Effecting Postconviction Ju stice Beyond the Model Rules, the \"law\" mandating prosecutorial postconviction conduct is effectively nonexistent. Given the longstanding prosec utorial mandate to \"serve justice,\" it wou ld seem that prosecutors are obligated to act more proactively than the M odel Rules suggest where innocence claims are concerned. But to call the charge to \"serve justice\" a legal standard to guide prosecutors reviewing actual innocence claims is to overst ate its usefulness. As Professor David Luban observed, \"[T]here is no consensus about what justice is, and we have every reason to doubt there ever will be.\" 33 Indeed, there is no reason to assume that prosecutors who have fought these petitions through to the bitter end 30 Green & Yaroshefsky, supra note 18, at 511. 31 Id. 32 Id. at 511 -12. 33 Luban, supra note 13, at 20. 624 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 are not motivated by a desire to serve justice. Justice, as a guide for prosecutorial action, provides no analytical power that can guide a conscientious prosec utor in the review of claims of actual inn ocence. This lack of guidelines is pro blematic given the incentives prosecutors have to maintain a conviction regardless of the merits of the innocence claim before them. While prosecutors generally aspire to seek justice, their default response to postconviction innocence claims is often char acterized by reflexive skepticism and strenuous resistance, a reflex generated by the importance of conviction statistics for raises, recognition, and district attorney politics; social pressure from police officers and other prosecutors; the fact that mos t such claims are baseless; and the importance of giving finality to victims and the public.34 Although the law requires little of pro secutors following a guilty verdict, the prosecutor's obligation to ensure that \"guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer \"35 suggests that prosecutors should play a proactive role in exonerating the convicted inn ocent. In other words, prosecutors operate under an ongoing obligation to justice, an obligation that does not terminate upon receipt of a jury verdict. As stated by the National District Attorneys Association , \"The primary responsibility of prosecution is to see that justice is accomplished.\"36 Of course, \"justice\" is a somewhat imprecise guideline for prosecutorial conduct, and reliance on that term for day -to-day pr osecutorial decision making essentially has left difficult ethical questions to be decided by individual prosecutors, who are making these decisions based on their indi vidual moral compasses and the exigencies of limited resources. Part III of this Article parses what \"justice\" may require of prosecutors in the postconvi ction context. B. Post conviction Prosecutorial Ethics Scholarship The role of prosecutors in postconviction relief has been a hot topic in legal academia since at least 2005, when Professor Zacharias first suggested that prosecutors' \"minister of justice\" role may require them to proactively engage actual innocence claims even after the rendering of a guilty verdict. The scholarship largely has followed three paths: (1) an exploration of t he existence of 34 See, e.g. , Green & Yaroshefsky, supra note 18, at 475 -76; Medwed, supra note 8, at 134- 48. 35 Berger v.

Professors Brandon Garrett and Samuel Gross have compiled a number of surveys that not only attempt to grasp the scope of this country's wrongful conviction problem but also to draw conclusions regarding the most prominent 37 See, e.g. , Green & Yaroshefsky, supra note 18, at 41; note 13, at 16 - 17; note 18, at 55 -57; Zachar ias, supra note 13, at 176. 38 See, e.g. , GARRETT , supra note 19, at 6 -11; GROSS & SHAFFER , supra note 5, at 1- 5. 39 See, e.g. , INTEGRITY PROJECT REPORT , supra note 20, at 216- 18; Ware, supra note 20, at 1049 -50. 40 See, e.g. , Douglas H.

This Article parses that standard in Part III.B . 626 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 contributing factors to wrongful conviction.45 Reviewing the data from these studies indicates that a high correlation exists between wrongful conviction and eyewitness identification, unsubstantiated confessions, government i nformant testimony, or non- DNA forensic analysis of physical evidence.46 These conclusions not only allow prosecutors and police to improve preconviction procedures for bringing charges, but they provide prosecutors flags for wrongful conviction that prosec utors may rely on as part of their postconviction review protocol.47 Finally, a growing number of scholars are applying a pragmatic approach to prosecutorial postconviction ethics, exploring the specific steps prosecutors are now or should be taking to reme dy existing wrongful convictions.48 Scholars like Professor Medwed and Professor Rachel Barkow posit concrete, practical suggestions for prosecutors' offices to implement in improving prosecutorial objectivity,49 while practitioners like Barry Scheck of the Innocence Project and Michael Ware (formerly of the Dallas County Conviction Integrity Unit) discuss in concrete terms how best to counteract natural prosecutorial inclinations toward upholding convi ction, using specifically Dallas's Conviction Integrity U nit as an example of the innovations possible in a prosecutor 's office.50 Likewise, this Article draws upon the experiences of Dallas and four other conviction integrity units to identify innovations in postconviction review that comply with prosecutors' pos tconviction ethical obligations and also are practical and palatable to prosecutors and, therefore , may be of interest to other prosec utors. This Article builds on and bridges the important scholarship described above, making several unique contributions to the literature on the prosecutors' role in postconviction review of actual innocence claims. First, as just discussed, this Article canvasses five functioning conviction integrity units, gathering infor mation that is, for the most part, not publicly ava ilable but that is essential for ide ntifying feasible ways in which prosecutors can play a role in exonerating the convicted innocent. Second, this Article distills from the practices of conviction integrity units principles that encourage objective prosecutorial review and can be broadly applied in prosecutors' offices across the country, large or small, cash strapped or 45 See GARRETT , supra note 19, at 6 -13; GROSS & SHAFFER , supra note 5, at 40 (highlighting factors associated with e xonerations) ; PETRO & PETRO , supra note 6, at 115. 46 See Cynthia E. Jones, The Right Remedy f or the Wrongly Convicted: Judicial Sanctions for Destruction of DNA Evidence , 77 F ORDHAM L. REV. 2893, 2928 (2009). There is a significant volume of high- quality scholarship exploring the common causes of wrongful conviction and identifying those listed he re as some of the most prevalent causes. See, e.g. , GARRETT , supra note 19, at 8 -11; GROSS & SHAFFER , supra note 5, at 40. That discussion is outside the scope of t his Article, but in the past five years, there have been several very interesting statistical anal yses done on this topic. 47 See infra Part III.B. 48 See, e.g. , Scheck, supra note at 2250 -51; Ware, 20, at 1049- 50. 49 Medwed, supra note 8, at 169 -181; Medwed, supra note 18, at 58 -65; INTEGRITY PROJECT , supra note 20, at 4-9. 50 Scheck, supra note 20, at 2250; Ware, supra note 20, at 149 -50. 2014] THE NEW PROSECUTOR 'S DILEMMA 627 well funded. Third, this Article fills a gap not only in the scholarship but in prosecutorial practice, by combining these principles wit h clearly articulated standards of proof that would assist prosecutors in determining whether additional action in investigating or responding to an innocence claim is appropriate. This final innovation is important for a number of reasons : improving consi stency in office responses to i nnocence claims, assisting prosecutors in fulfilling their duty to serve justice, and ensuring that office resources are expended under circumstances the chief prosecutor has determined are appropriate and in a way that will distinguish valid innocence claims from the significant number of frivolous ones eff iciently. II. THE PRACTICE OF POST CONVICTION REVIEW As mentioned above, this Article is not the first to identify the need to address postconviction ethics. And indeed, other scholars have relied on i nnovative efforts in the Dallas and New York County district attorney's o ffices to create a system for evaluating innocence claims and preventing wrongful conviction.51 Part II goes further than these previous efforts, pr esenting the first in -depth evaluation of five such efforts \u2014known as \"conviction integrity units\" \u2014operating throughout the country.52 The conviction integrity units reviewed in Part II \u2014Dallas County, Texas; New York County, New York (\"Manhattan\"); Harris County, Texas; Santa Clara County, Califo rnia; and Cook County, Illinois , based on interviews with the directors of each unit or other senior prosecutors in the office53\u2014reveal not only important basic principles but also notable absences of standar dized review wi thin or among prosecutors' offices. The lack of clearly articulated standards of proof that would guide prosecutorial discretion\u2014 or a reliance on \"gut feeling\" for 51 Green & Yaroshefsky, supra 494; Scheck, supra note 20; Ware, supra note 20, at 1034. 52 Because information on prosecutorial decision making and methodology is, generally, not publicly available, gathering information regarding postconviction review regimes is a challenge. See Angela J. Davis, Prosecution and Race: The Power and Privilege of Discretion , 67 F ORDHAM L. REV. 13, 58 (1998) (noting that public access to information regarding prosecutorial practices has \"not expanded since the 1820s\"). Because the American prosecutor, as Angela Davis has observed, both is \"the most powerful official[] in the criminal justice system\" and wields its power with vast, unreviewable discretion, the dearth of publicly available information on how prosecutors exercise that discretion is troubling from a constitutional rights and transparency perspective and from a government efficiency perspective. See A NGELA J. DAVIS , ARBITRARY JUSTICE : THE POWER OF THE AMERICAN PROSECUTOR 5 (2009). 53 The informati on in Part II is a product of interviews with the directors of the Dallas County, Harris County, and Santa Clara County conviction integrity units. Information regarding Manhattan's conviction integrity unit was obtained by interviewing a senior assistant district attorney in the office (the unit director was on vacation), and information regarding Cook County's program was obtained through an interview with Fabio Valentini, the immediate supervisor of the conviction integrity unit director and the chief of Cook County's Criminal Bureau. 628 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 identifying a valid innocence claim \u2014leaves even the efforts of these highly effective conviction integrity units vulnerable to individual prosecutorial biases and pote ntial discrimination. Where Part I presents the legal and scholarly efforts to understand postconviction ethics, Part II provides the pra ctical context gleaned from the five units highlighted herein. This context makes clear the need for and benefits of the pr oposal in Part III. A. Case Studies in Conviction Integrity Unit Implementation 1. Dallas County District Attorney's Office In the wake of a series of embarrassing public exonerations, Dallas County residents elected Craig Watkins district attorney on a platform of restoring integrity to the district attorney's office.54 Watkins pulled his first assistant, Terri Moore, from private practice and immediately implemented a new approach to the problem of wrongful conviction.55 They studied the county's wrongful convictions, reviewing them in the same way that the Federal Aviation Administration investigates an airplane crash scene, working backward from the wrongful conviction to s ee what malfunction in the system caused that result . 56 Watkins also hired an i nnocence project attorney to form a \"Conviction Integrity Unit,\" which would review postconviction claims of actual innocence, and he assigned the unit an addi tional prosecutor, paralegal, and investigator, all of whom would work on postconviction claims of innocence full time.57 While many innocence statutes bar those who have pled guilty, lack new evidence, or are no longer incarcerated from filing a claim of innocence,58 Dallas C ounty's Conviction Integrity Unit decided to 54 For decades before Watkins's election, the county had been infamously r esistant to innocence claims. See John Buntin, 2008 Public Officials of the Year: Exoneration Man, Craig Watkins , GOVERNING , http://www.governing.com/p oy/Craig -Watkins.html (last visited Apr. 20, 2014). Despite resistance to DNA testing on the part of Watkins's predecessors, by the time Watkins took office as district attorney in 2007, Dallas County had already seen nine DNA exonerations \u2014more than any ot her county in the United States. Ware, supra note 20, at 1035. The county's tenth, eleventh, and twelfth exonerations came during Watkins's first weeks in office. Id. (citations omitted). 55 Ware, supra note 20, at 1039. The Thin Blue Line , a 1988 documentary depicting the wrongful conviction of Randall Adams who initially received a death sentence, presents a particularly disturbing account of Dallas County justice u nder long -time district a ttorney Henry Wade. See generally T HE THIN BLUE LINE (1988). 56 Ware, supra note 20, at 1039. 57 GARRETT , supra note 19, at 259; Ware, supra note 20, at 1034, 1040 -41. 58 Texas has not adopted an actual innocence statute. Rather, the exclusive postconviction remedy in final felony convictions in Texas courts is through a writ of habeas corpus. See T EX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN., art. 11.07, \u00a7 5 (West Supp. 2012) (\"After conviction the procedure outlined in this Act shall be exclusive and any other proceeding shall be void and of no force and effect in discharging the prisoner\"). Texas courts have, however , recognized a freestanding innocence claim through habeas jurisprudence for inmates who can produce new evidence of innocence. See, e.g. , Ex parte 2014] THE NEW PROSECUTOR 'S DILEMMA 629 review all claims of actual innocence, from misdemeanors to major felonies, regardless of how old the case.59 Further, the unit would not use as its touchstone the rather stringent standard applied by Texas court s for determining whether a petitioner is actually innocent.60 Indeed, the only real restriction employed by the office would be a jurisdictional one: the conviction must be a Dallas County conviction. 61 Announcement of the unit's creation was greeted by a m assive flood of innocence claims from prisoners across Texas and the country, numbers which have since tapered off to fifteen to twenty new claims a week.62 Watkins also decided to reverse the office's longstanding opposition to DNA testing, implementing a policy of supporting testing if there was relevant biological evidence to test and the outcome of that test was potentially dispositive on the issue of guilt or innocence.63 In the two years following that policy change, nine people were exonerated.64 Although inmates have no right to postconviction discovery in Texas, as in virtually every state across the country, Dallas County also adopted an \"open file\" policy of providing requesting inmates with access to prosecution files. 65 While the open -file policy is not without some limits (e.g., inmate s making an Eighth Amendment claim may be asked which particular portions of the file are relevant to the claim),66 generally, where allegations like prosecutorial misconduct are made, the trial file is readily provided to the requesting party.67 Early on, Dallas also began a collaborative review of its DNA case files with the Innocence Project of Texas, in which, upon a showing of a \"plausible claim of inn ocence,\"68 Dallas would provide the Innocence Project the prosecuti on's entire file, including work product.69 This practice, among others, Duke, No. AP -76762, 2012 WL 1059895, at *1 (Tex. Crim. App. Mar. 28, 2012) (unpublished decision). The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals first articulated its innocence standard for noncapital cases in Ex Parte Elizondo, 947 S.W.2d 202 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996). Under that decision, a petitio ner \"must show by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable juror wou ld have convic ted [the applicant] in light of the new evidence.\" Id. at 212 (Baird, J., concurring). While that standard still holds sway for noncapital cases, the Texas legislature has altered that standard for capital cases. See TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN., art. 11.071 (West 2012). 59 See Telephone Interview with Russell Wilson, Conviction Integrity Unit Chief, Dallas Cnty. Dist. Attorney's Office (June 27, 2012) [hereinafter Wilson I nterview]. 60 See id.; see also Ex Parte Elizondo, 947 S.W.2d at 212. 61 See Wilson Inte rview, supra note 59. 62 Id. 63 Ware, supra note 20, at 1039. 64 PETRO & PETRO , supra note 6, at 208. 65 See Wilson Inte rview, supra note 59. 66 Id. 67 See id. (noting that upon instituting the open- file policy, the office soon di scovered that providing the trial file to every requester was more costly than antic ipated). 68 Scheck, supra note 20, at 2250. 69 Id. Scheck also cited the Conviction Integrity Unit's willingness to investi gate leads proposed by the inmate claiming innocence where the unit is uniquely situated to purs ue those leads; the unit's willingness to allow the Innocence Project or other inmate lawyers to 630 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 led Barry Scheck, cofoun der of the Innocence Project, to actively promote the Dallas model as \"the most prominent and successful model for a Conviction Integrity Unit.\"70 Just as Watkin s began his tenure by reforming and updating office policies on Brady71 disclosures, eyewitness identifications, and police lineups, the Conviction Integrity Unit continue d to review closely its exonerations for ways to improve office procedure.72 All of the exonerations uncovered to date were obtained under prior district attorneys, but where the attorneys who prosecuted the cases still work in the DA office, they are notified of the exoneration and its cause, and if appropriate, additional steps to reform o ffice procedure may be taken .73 Moreover, to ensure unbiased review of an innocence claim, the initial prosecuting attorney typically plays only a limited role in the postconviction review process.74 Where the innocence claim alleges a Brady violation, the original prosecutor almost certainly will receive an inquiry about disclosures;75 however, if the convicted individual claims an eyewitness misidentification, the office believes there is little reason to consult with the original prosecutor. 76 Watkins was well aware that he risked the disfavor of Dallas County's veteran prosecutors by instituting a conviction review program. Indeed, \"more than 200 of the 267 attorneys [in the office] had actively campaigned for his opponent\" in the election, believing Watkins lacked sufficient trial experience to be district attorney.77 \"It's difficult ,\" Watkins acknowledged . \"I still walk around the office gently because I know there are a lot of people who still don't want me here.\"78 Watkins had to work hard to ensure his C onviction Integrity Unit was not marginalized within the office. Structurally, he ensured the unit was integrated with the already -existing units that were likely to have overlapping cases and that these divisions (appellate and writ) would operate under the direction of the head investigate leads those entities are uniquely situated to pursue; the unit's ongoing, close working relationship with the public defender's office, which inclu des a willingness to freely exchange information and to engage in joint investigations; and the unit's formal adoption of Model Rule 3.8 as official policy. Id. at 2250 -51. 70 Id. at 2250. 71 373 U.S. 83 (1963). 72 See Wilson Interview, supra note 59. The new office policy regarding Brady , implemented during Watkins's tenure, specifies that a prosecutor may be fired if the Brady violation is sufficiently egregious. See id. 73 Id. According to Russell Wilson, no pr osecutor currently with the office has had a wrongful conviction that was the product of prosecutorial misconduct. The majority of wrongful convictions have been the product of an erroneous eyewi tness identification or similar error, often linked with insu fficient prior office prot ocols, which have since been revised during Watkins's tenure. See id. 74 See id. 75 Id. 76 See id. 77 Buntin, supra note 54. 78 Id. 2014] THE NEW PROSECUTOR 'S DILEMMA 631 of the unit .79 The head of the Conviction Integrity Unit is number three in the office in terms of a uthority, reporting directly to the district attorney, and , by virtue of this seniority, would ensure the office's exoneration- focused policies would be implemented a ctively in all divisions.80 Even more critical to office morale has been the successful discovery and exoneration of many convicted innocent individuals, validating the work of the unit and underscoring the reality of the wr ongful conviction problem. Dallas County's rapid reform of office culture may in part be a function of its initial focus on DNA cases, where exonerations can be quick, straightforward, and indisputable. 81 These decisive, conclusive, and unquestionable exone rations demonstrated clearly the importance of the team's work to prosecutors in the office and the importance of having such a unit as part of the office's core mission.82 2. Harris County District Attorney's Office Pat Lykos, then- district attorney for Harris County, Texas, set up that office's Post-Conviction Review Unit in 2009, having run for office on a platform of reform.83 Harris County has \"a reputation as one of the harshest prosecutorial jurisdictions in the state,\"84 leading the country in sending defendants to death row.85 Indeed, s ince the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976, 79 See Wilson Interview, supra note 59. 80 Id. 81 See id. Henry Wade, Dallas's district attorney from the 1950s through the 1980s, made preservation of DNA evidence office policy. As a result, Dallas had a massive cache of DNA cases to use at the outset of its convict ion integrity efforts.

Dist. Attorney's Office (July 21, 2012) [hereinafter Chin & O'Neil Interview]. Lykos's predecessor, Chuck Rosenthal, resigned in 2008 after having been caught sending racist and pornographic e -mails from his work account (Rosenthal had survived a crime lab scandal four years earlier which resulted in nearly four hundred prisoners being entitled to new DNA testing). Ben Crair, Pat Lykos: Texas' Capital Punishment Avenger Harris County DA Pat Lykos was an iconic Texas prosecutor, from his handlebar mustache to the 111 defendants he sent to death row between 1992 and 2000 alone.

We have 50,000 felony cases a year fil ed in Harris County on average and over 80,000 misdemeanor cases. You can't have that volume without errors being made. . . .

They have to have confidence that it's fair, that the law is applied equally.91 The Innocence Project of Texas has lauded creation of the new unit,92 and in the first three years of its existence, the unit has played a leading role in the exoneration of three convicted innocents. 93 Since announcing its postconviction criminals: he once sought a life sentence for a substitute teacher who sold a joint to a student .

There have been \"[l]ots of frivolous claims ,\" Lykos has commented. \" But we review everything.\"94 Unlike the conviction integrity units in other jurisdictions, Harris County limits its review to cases with the poten tial to yield definitive forensic confirmation of innocence.95 Harris County's Post -Conviction Review Unit is taske d with responding to letters claiming actual inn ocence plus all requests for postconviction DNA.96 Harris County's policy on postconviction file sharing also differs from Dallas County's. Unlike Dallas, Harris County does not open its files to unrepresente d inmates.97 But once an inmate has been a ppointed an attorney (which happens in all DNA testing requests that qualify under the postconviction DNA testing statute and many innocence claims with a forensic component), the office will permit the attorney to see the parts of the file relevant to the requested DNA or forensic testing .98 Like with the other conviction integrity units, guilty pleas, expiration of statutes of limitation , misdemeanor offenses, or lack of a judicial remedy are not considered bars to review.99 If an exoneration would require the unit to make a credibility determination (such as in a case of witness recantation), however, the investigation ends there: the office views this type of determination as within the province of a jury and theref ore outside the purview of prosecutorial review.100 In the unit's view, the proper venue for those cases is the court system, where a judge can make the required credibility determination.101 Of course, the initial innocence claim itself often does not provide sufficient information to determine whether conclusive, objective exonerating forensic evidence exists or whether reliance on a credibility determination ultimately would be required. Therefore, the unit may still review a claim that lacks an express tie to forensics in an initial claim. The Post -Conviction Review Unit has instituted several structural protections to preserve its independent judgment. As in Dallas, the unit reports directly to the district attorney and her first assistant, and is only acco untable to them.102 Second, for those cases in which investigation is warranted, the unit avoids discussing the investigation with the original prosecutor of the case until the investigation (including witness interviews and forensic testing) is complete and the unit has made its own preliminary assessment. 103 For those cases that appear to be headed in the general direction of a new trial or exoneration, however, the office views 94 O'Hare, supra note 92. 95 See Chin & O'Neil Interview, supra note 83. 96 The Post -Conviction Review Unit is responsible for responding to requests for DNA te sting, but unless a credible claim is made that the evidence will be of an exonerating nature, the office enforces the limits of the statute as written.

New York County (Manhattan) District Attorney's Office When Cyrus R. Vance Jr. assumed his post as Manhattan district attorney in January 2010, he replaced Robert Morgenthau, who had served as the Manhattan district attorney for thirty -five years and established what many considered \"the country's premier prosecutorial office.\" 106 Vance began his le gal career in the Manhattan district a ttorney 's office in the 1980s, and even then the office had a unique culture that favored exoneration.107 When Vance came to office, he built on this tradition, initiating a Conviction Integrity Program with a two- fold purpose of preventing wrongful convictions on the front end of the criminal justice process and addressing claims of actual innocence on the back end.108 Vance set up Manhattan's Conviction Integrity Program in March 2010, a program with three main components : a Conviction Integrity Committee, a conviction integrity chief, and an outside Conviction Integrity Policy Advisory Panel.109 The committee, comprised of ten senior members of the district 104 Id. 105 See id. 106 Press Release , N.Y.

DA Vance Announces Conviction Integrity Program (Mar. 4, 2010) [hereinafter N.Y. Cnty. ADA Press Release], available at http://www.bloomberg.co m/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid= . 2014] THE NEW PROSECUTOR 'S DILEMMA 635 attorney's staff, focus es on the front end of the process, reviewin g and revising practices and policies related to training, case assessment, investigation, and disclosure obligations, with a particular eye for the most common errors leading to wrongful conviction, such as eyewitness misidentification and false confessio ns.110 While Manhattan has long required its prosecutors to comply with rigorous checklists to ensure justice on the front end of the criminal justice process, and had long required its prosec utors to be convinced of guilt \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" prior t o proceeding with a prosecution, the c ommittee, upon its inception, engaged in further development of these checklists to specifically address the problem of wrongful conviction.111 These detailed checklists have two virtues for prosecutors: helping to ensur e the defendant in the case is the actual perpetrator and assisting prosecutors in making a stronger case against the actual perpetrator.112 For instance, because eyewitness misidentification is a common contributor to wrongful conviction,113 in cases involvin g only one eyewitness, Manhattan prosecutors use an office- created check list on the types of corroborative evidence for which they should look. These checklists both bolster cases and serve as a reminder that extra care is required in that particular type of case to avoid wrongful conviction.114 Likewise, the c ommi ttee updated the office's checklists for Brady - disclosure obligations, reminding prosecutors of what types of material they should be looking for and specific pla ces where they should be looking.115 For all of these materials, the committee relied on the latest research put together by cognitive scientists and other empirical analysis done by its Advisory Panel members.116 These advisors also play an ongoing, albeit largely intermittent, advisory role fo r Manhattan's Conviction Integrity Program, where the c onviction integrity chief seeks their advice on an ad hoc basis as specific issues arise that are relevant to their expertise.117 As another component of this front -end process, Manhattan revised its training regime to incorporate best practices for avoiding wrongful convictions, adding a \"conviction integrity\" component to each of its major training sessions.118 New Manhattan prosecutors are trained on how to recognize the warning signs of a wrongful conv iction , 119 using real cases in which the office discovered a wrongful 110 Wrongful Conviction, supra note 109. 111 See Telephone Interview with Manhattan Assistant District Attorney, (July 6, 2012) [hereinafter Manhattan ADA Interview]. 112 Id. 113 GARRETT , supra note 19, at 48 -50, 80. 114 See Manhattan ADA Interview, supra note 111. 115 Id.; see also Vance, Jr., supra note 107. 116 See Manhattan ADA Interview, supra note 111. 117 See id. 118 Vance, Jr., supra note 107. 119 Id.; see also D ANIEL S.

Postconviction claims of actual innocence go directly to the Conviction Integrity Program , where they are logged, tracked, and receive an initial review by 120 See Manhattan ADA Interview, supra note 111. 121 See id. 122 Id. 123 Vance, Jr., supra note 107; Meet the Executive Team , N.Y.

Rather, if Sard determines further investigation of a claim is needed, she forwards the claim to an assistant district attorney, who will manage the reinvestigation of the case along with the rest of her caseload.132 That assistant district a ttorney will then report her conclusions back to Sard, who determines whether additional review is necessary ; Sard then r eports the decision to the district attorney.133 In cases where a full -scale investigation is conducted, which often takes from six to tw elve months, the Conviction Integrity Committee will meet and review the assistant's findings upon conclusion of the investigation, often for several hours.134 In those instances, where an inmate is represented by counsel, that lawyer will be invited to atte nd the meeting and make a recommendation to the district attorney as to how the office should proceed.135 Like Dallas County, Manhattan does not employ a concrete standard in determining guilt or innocence, as Vance explained: I do not pretend that we have devised a simple formula in this regard. I will say this: if in reviewing a case, we are looking at the same evidence the jury saw, and if the trial seems to us to have been conducted in a fair and competent manner, we would be strongly disinclined to vaca te a jury verdict of guilty\u2014even if we feel, in hindsight, that we might have reached a different verdict. But on the other hand, if we now have evidence the jury did not know, or if there was some procedural defect in the trial that prevented the jury fro m evaluating the evidence fairly, then we would be more inclined to substitute our view of the case for that of the trial jury. But in each instance, the question is the same, and remains central: do we believe, or at least strongly suspect, that the defen dant is actually innocent? 136 In the year and a half since the program began, Manhattan has vacated one conviction (the case awaits retrial) and confirmed through investigation that two 129 Vance, Jr., supra note 107. 130 See id. 131 Id. 132 Id. 133 Id. 134 Manha ttan ADA Interview, supra note 111. 135 Vance, Jr., supra note 107. 136 Id. 638 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 other convictions were valid.137 Although Vance acknowledges that the pro gram is still a work in progress, he also has described the results of his Conviction Integrity Program as \"unequivocal\": \"the system we have devised works.\"138 4. Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office In 2011, the newly elected district attorney in Santa Clara County, California Jeffrey Rosen, established a Conviction Integrity Unit for his district.139 Like Dallas, Santa Clara had encountered its fair share of bad press in the lead up to creation of the unit, including a series of misconduct alleg ations against prosecutors in the office140 and the suspension of one such prosecutor by the California State Bar Association.141 Like Lykos and Watkins, Rosen ran on a 137 See id. 138 Id. 139 See Interview by David Onek with Jeffrey Rosen, Santa Clara Cnty.

The sanctioning of this Santa Clara prosecutor by the California State Bar is notable in part because of the extreme rarity of prosecutorial sancti oning. Between 1970 and 2009, only forty -four cases had been brought in which prosecutors faced disciplinary proceedings for misconduct relating to defendants' constitutional rights. D AVIS, supra note 52, at 12 8- 29. This was even true in cases where appellate courts, in reversing a conviction due to Brady violations or prosecutors knowingly allowing lying witnesses to testify, described the prosecutors' behavior as \"unforgivable,\" \"intolerable,\" \"beyond reprehen sion,\" and and dishonest.\" Id. at 135 -36.

The charges stemmed from a 2006 child molestation case in which Benson allegedly failed to turn over a videotape that cast doubt on whether the victim w as, in fact, abused, and then denied concealing the ev idence, including while under oath in court. The defendant in the case served four years in prison before his conviction was overturned on the basis of Benson's co nduct (conduct expressly condemned by t he appellate court). The discovery of the suppressed videotape led to the discovery of thousands of other such undisclosed tapes, forcing prosecutors and public defenders to reexamine hundreds of molestation cases.

N ot only had Angel reformed the county's eyewitness protocol and pushed for the recording of suspect interviews in cases involving violent crime, but he also participated in an internal office investigation that resulted in the exoneration of a man wrongfully convicted and sentenced to life in prison.146 In addition to his years of experience as a prosecutor, Angel also teaches a seminar on righting wrongful convictions at Santa Clara Law School with Northern California Innocence Project Executive Director Cookie Ridolfi. Angel is also well regarded by both prosecutors and defense lawyers,147 a valuable asset given that, l ike Manhattan and Dallas, Santa Clara often collaborates with the Innocence Project on pos tconviction innocence cases.148 Like Manhattan, Santa Clara's program involves prominent front - and back- end component s. On the front end, the office strengthened its t raining for prosecutors and police officers on ethics, discovery obligations , and the warning signs of wrongful convictions, often drawing upon old cases of official misconduct and wrongful convictions from the office to instruct on how to avoid these problems.149 Rosen also changed the office's policy on Brady disclosures.

Indeed, when an earlier Santa Clara district attorney, George Kennedy, decided to set up a task force to investigate and improve protocols relating to wrongful conviction in the early 2000s, he also chose David Angel to spearhead the project (the task force was later disbanded under Dolores Carr).

While California's DNA testing statute is fairly defendant friendly,160 Santa Clara adopted an even less demanding standard for DNA requests, permitting 150 Rosen Intervie w, supra note 139. 151 Id. 152 Id. 153 Id. 154 Santa Clara does limit itself to postconviction claims of actual innocence. If the claim is raised in an open case, the unit refers the claim back to the trial deputy and instructs the defendant to bring it to the attention of the relevant division director if appropriate. See Angel Interview, supra note 146. Angel indicated that failing to honor this division could generate the perception of the unit as an ombudsman looking over trial prosecutor's shoulders.

As Angel explained, it is essential that the trial attorney not be in charge of the review in order to preserve the independence of t he evaluation (a policy which, he notes, benefits the original prosecutor \u2014ensuring credibility for the finding that no prosecutorial error occurred).164 On the other hand, if the reviewing attorney does not consult with the original prosecutor at all, the Conviction Integrity Unit may appear to be searching for prosecutorial error and come to be viewed by line atto rneys as a watchdog, rather than as a prosecutorial failsafe.165 For those reasons, when Angel or one of his assistant district attorneys conducts the initial review, pulls the file, and decides further investigation is warranted, the original prosecutor receives a courtesy call or e- mail explaining that a review is underway and soliciting any information the original prosecutor might consider helpful.166 Most often, the original prosecutor does not have information to share, but in a minority of cases, the prosecutor does weigh in, and her views, dismissive or affirming, are taken into consideration.167 Santa Clara has structured the unit to maximize its independence and objectivity. Angel is part of the office's executive management and reports directly to Rosen.168 He participates in the weekly executive meetings in which the most pressing current issues and office priorities are discussed and through which the moral tone of the office is set.169 As Angel explained, having the Conviction Integrity Unit as a central part of the process is crucial to its success and credibility within the office so that it is not viewed as an adversarial side entity, but instead as central to the mission of the office.170 The centrality of Santa Clara's Conviction Integrity Unit is also ensured by the office hierarchy: Angel oversees the office's appellate division, its crime lab, and its training program.171 By virtue of his 161 Angel Interview, supra note 146. 162 See id. 163 See id. 164 See id. 165 See id. 166 See id. 167 See id. 168 See id. 169 See id. 170 See id. 171 See id.

Indeed, Angel's authority over the appellate unit is important to setting the appropriate standard for prosecutorial conduct. When appellate prosecutors are narrowly focused on maintaining convictions, they may defend on appeal questionable ethical behavior on behalf of the original prosecutor simply because a constitutional justification for doing so exists.172 This is true even where justice may be better served by repudiating such behavior and even allowing the conviction to be reversed.173 The Conviction Integrity Unit has the authority, however, to change the way these cases are argued and to send the message to prosecutors, courts, and the public that, as A ngel explained, \"the standard in our office is not the constitutional minimum.\"174 5. Cook County State's Attorney's Office In February 2012, Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez announced her office's creation of a Conviction Integrity Unit175 and that the office already was looking into thirty -five cases in which defendants claimed innocence.176 Both during and before Alvarez's tenure, Cook County has had a long -term problem with wrongful conviction. Alvar ez has come under heavy criticism from the Innocence Project for her handling of the wrongful convictions of young black men, specifically the cases of the Dixmoor Five and Englewood Four, cases which involved exonerating DNA.177 Although Alvarez has come under fire herself in the pub lic sector and private bar. Through its oversight of the crime lab \u2014which in Santa Clara is, according to Angel, top notch \u2014the unit can ensure that the maximum in Brady material is provided to defendants. See id. The office has taken the view that complete transparency regarding forensic analysts and analysis is the prosecutorial obligation; as a result, S anta Clara produces to defendants information regarding any corrective action taken against an analyst, the results of the relevant analyst's proficiency tests, and anything else arguably negative that is not directly related to a purely personnel matter.

According to the National Registry of Exonerations, a joint project by the University of Michigan and Northwestern University law schools, Illinois \u2014an d Cook County specifically \u2014leads the country in wrongful convictions since 1989.179 Cook County's Conviction Integrity Unit has four attorneys dedicated to reviewing postconviction claims on a full -time basis: the deputy supervisor in the Special Litigation Unit and three other experienced attorneys.180 In addition, the unit has two full- time investigators and a victim and witness specialist.181 The unit is under the umbrella of Cook County's Criminal Bureau and its Special Litigation Division, along with Cook C ounty's Post-Conviction Unit, which reviews and responds to habeas cases. Like Dallas and Manhattan, Cook County does not restrict its review to claims cognizable in court \u2014it will review a claim of actual innocence whether or not it complies with statutory or precedential requirements for an innocence claim.182 Indeed, Cook County may proceed with postconviction review even while a judge i s still deciding whether an inmate's actual innocence claim should move forward.183 Unlike Dallas, Cook County did not obtai n additional funding or grant money to set up its Conviction Integrity Unit, choosing instead to divert resources from other office programs in favor of its postconviction review pr ogram.184 In the wake of announcing the unit's creation, Cook County received a tidal wave of claims of actual innocence, which only began slowing months later.185 At present, it is prioritizing the most serious claims of actual innocence, like murders confessing to the 1994 rape and murder of a prostitute, also des pite police and prosecutorial access to exo nerating DNA.

The reviewing prosecutor looks for the same things she would have in a preconviction review of the case: consistency or inconsistency in witness accounts, whether the offender's account is credible and genuine , and whether there is physical evid ence (DNA or otherwise) that was not tested contemporaneously but that might have become testable since or requires retesting. 193 Just as with the initial charging decision, the prosecutor is instructed to review the case with no presumption of the suspect's guilt, but she does weigh to some degree the fact that the individual has been co nvicted by a jury, has had a trial judge likely reject a motion for new trial, and generally has had the verdict upheld on appeal and in the postconviction context. 194 The off ice has no standard or scientific formula for determining when and whether an inmate has demonstrated her innocence.195 Rather, the unit relies on the 186 See id. 187 Wildeboer, supra note 175; see also Valentini Interview, s upra note 175. 188 See Valentini Interview, supra note 175. 189 See id.

What These Units Indicate and What They Are Missing The conviction integrity units in all five of these jurisdictions represent a significant and impressive investment of time, energy, funds, and experience by very busy prosecutors with finite resources. Through this dedication of intellectual and financial resources, and now through the years of experience these offices have gained through conducting postconviction review, several overarching, essential components of postconviction review are apparent, including the importance of encouraging innocence seeking, openness, and objectivity. Each of the conviction integrity units reviewed above, and particularly Dallas and Santa Clara, have structured their units in an attempt to make conviction integrity, or innocence seeking, part of the office culture. For example, in Santa Clara County, the conviction integrity unit director also oversees the office's appe llate division, and by refusing to defend constitutionally questiona ble changes on the appellate side, he has changed the office's preconviction practices, requiring the office to operate well above the constitutionally required standards of conduct.199 All conviction integrity units but Harris County and Cook County have embraced open- file discovery and ope n-DNA -testing policies, and all carefully circumscribe the role of the original prosecutor in reviewing innocence claims. The efforts of these conviction integrity units demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of these policies, and all of these pol icies taken together form a postconviction review structure that is capable of widespread implementation by prosecutors' offices across the country. While Dallas County was able to secure additional funding specifically aimed at implementing a conviction integrity unit, the majority of these units represent a significant expenditure and a shifting of resources away from other office priorities. But postconviction review need not be this expensive. As detailed below in Part III, postconviction review does not require a freestanding conviction integrity unit: applying the three essential principles above can assist any office in impro ving its ability to identify the wrongfully convicted, whether the office has prosec utors dedicated full time to this kind of rev iew or not. 196 See id. 197 See id. 198 See id. 199 Angel Interview, supra note 146. 646 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 III. RESOLVING THE PROSECUTOR 'S DILEMMA : STRUCTURAL MODIFICATIONS AND TIERED REVIEW The efforts of the five studied district attorneys' offices provide important insights for effective postconviction review, but even among these highly effe ctive units , there is room for improvement. Part III proposes to resolve remaining structural weaknesses in a way that will be tractable in other district attorneys' offices. Part III.A draws together the most useful aspects of these units and uses them to outline three broadly applicable structural modifications for prosecutorial postconviction review: (1) a management -level prosecutor must direct the review of inno cence claims; (2) the review must be performed by someone other than the original prosecutor ; and (3) the office must, with specific exceptions outlined below, cooperate with inmates by opening case files and approving requests for DNA tes ting. Part III.B then supplies what the established structure of each conviction integrity unit lacks: legal and ethical principles that can guide that postconviction review process. As explained in the introduction, \"tiered r eview\" functions guide the posture that prosecutors adopt in the face of claims of actual innocence. The concept of tiered review encompasses three components : (1) a prosecutorial investigation where a bona fide issue exists as to the petitioner's inno cence, (2) dropping of prosecutorial opposition to an innocence claim where the investigation demo nstrates a \"reasonable likelihood of innocen ce,\" and (3) affirmative support for exoneration in the event that the investigation yields \"clear and convincing evidence\" that the petitioner was wrongfully co nvicted. Taken together, these two pieces represent a complete review framework: first, a post conviction review structure designed to efficiently manage inherent prosecutorial biases, and second, a postconviction review process that operates within that structure using clear stan dards of review on which prosecutors can rely to determine what action is appropriate and when with regard to an innocence claim. Although in a resource -abundant world, prosecutors' offices across the country could each have a \"Conviction Integrity Unit\" devoted exclusively to postconviction review of innocence claims, in the vast majority of prosecutors' offices , the resources to dedicate prosecutors full time to that effort are simply missing. 200 While the framework set forth below is based on lessons learned from conviction integrity units, it could just as easily be used by an appellate division, postconviction writ division, or individual prosecutors who encounter claims of actual inn ocence. The most important characteristic of this type of postconviction review is the standardization itself \u2014that a fairly detailed protocol, with a clearly assigned 200 Indeed, for offices in less populous cities that receive far fewer innocence claims, it would be a waste of money and effort to do so. Of the approximately 2,500 district attorney offices across the United States, 85% are operate d by four lawyers or fewer. See Telephone Interview with Scott Burns, Exec. Dir., Nat'l Dist. Attorneys Ass'n (July 2, 2012) [hereinafter Burns Interview]. 2014] THE NEW PROSECUTOR 'S DILEMMA 647 standard of review and policy of maintaining an eye for innocence, is adopted by an office in its entirety and employed by all prosecutors engaged in reviewing innocence claims. While the specific standards of proof required in th e procedural component outlined in Part III.B are certain to be interpreted differently depending upon the prosecutor applying the standard,201 the very process of applying an objective standard \u2014of stepping away from \"gut instinct\" and attempting to look dispassionately at the evidence to determine whether it reaches the appropriate threshold\u2014 forces prosecutors to at least try to excise their biases and train a sharp eye on the merits of the case before them. This effort \u2014and the support that a clear office policy of obje ctive review provides for engaging in such an effort \u2014helps to align prosecutorial postconviction action with the minister of justice role prosecutors seek to o bserve. A. Essential Components of a Framework for Responding to Actual Innocence Claims The fundamental principles of a postconviction review regime, detailed below, are principles that apply as well to a six -prosecutor conviction integrity review team as to a two -prosecutor district attorney's office. These basic principles include ( 1) fostering an office culture of seeking innocence by integrating the postconviction review process into the office structure , (2) establishing a policy of openness by freely authorizing DNA testing and providing open- file discovery, and (3) encouraging objectivity by creating an office authority position with direct access to the district attorney responsible for innocence claim review. 1. Fostering an Office Culture of Seeking Innocence A crucial component for ensuring objective review of postconvicti on claims is to develop an office policy of seeking innocence by making the awareness of wrongful conviction an integral part of office culture. By instituting a standardized office -wide postconviction review policy, the district attorney sends the message that prosecutors should seek out wrongful convictions. When prosecutors are actively involved in the exoneration process pursuant to office policy, it opens up the possibility for an exoneration to be perceived as an office victory rather than a public em barrassment. Having the goal of finding the wrongful conviction before it finds the office incentivizes prosecutors to give claims of innocence an objective review, harnessing the prosecutor's naturally competitive spirit in pursuit of postconviction justi ce. Moreover, where the district attorney institutes a policy that acknowledges the reality of wrongful convictions and educates prosecutors on their common causes, she removes some of the stigma associated with having obtained a wrongful conviction, which improves office morale, encourages objective review, and improves the likelihood that prosecutors with postconviction review 201 See infra Part III.B. 648 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 responsibilities will not be viewed with suspicion or hostility by others within the office.202 District attorneys signal to the off ice and the public their commitment to innocence through whom they choose to lead their conviction integrity efforts and by how they integrate a postconviction review process into the office's existent operations. In Dallas County, the past two heads of the conviction integrity unit have been criminal defense lawyers.203 To ensure that this individual was not marginalized and would have the necessary authority to implement desired reforms, Wat kins made him third in command in the office and supervisor over the office's existent postconviction units (e.g., the divisions handling appeals and postconviction writs). 204 In Santa Clara County, David Angel, a highly respected and long -time prosecutor, was chosen to lead the unit, operate as the office's third in comman d, and oversee appeals, postconviction writs, and all training for the office.205 Angel uses the appeals process to set the tone for post - and preconviction prosecutorial efforts. By refusing to defend questionable prosecutorial ethical conduct on appeal, Angel requires above- the-constitutional- minimum ethical conduct from the of fice's prosecutors prior to conviction, thereby increasing the robustness of day -to-day ethics in the office. Doing so also saves costs: ensuring the office operates well above the co nstitutional minimum on the front end reduces the amount of litigation the office faces on the back end in habeas and appeals, and it makes future claims far easier to defend.206 Entwining postconviction review efforts with appellate strategy also ensures a uniform office -wide position on issues of prosecutorial ethics\u2014without it, individual appellate attorneys end up responding to arguments and resolving immediate problems on a case -by-case basis, without any connection to an overall office policy to ensure that the mistake is not repeated in the future.207 2. Establishing a Policy of Openness and Disclosure In virtually all of the offices with conviction integrity units, a key part of sending a message of innocence seeking to prosecutors and the public has been to adopt a generous policy of DNA testing and file sharing, notwithstanding the lack 202 Where an office establishes as the baseline that wrongful convictions do occur and that avoiding prosecution of the innocent is a priority, prosecutors esse ntially will have to \"opt out\" of the office default in order to continue adversarial, reflexive responses to innocence petitions, and, therefore, fewer mistakes will be mad e in both the pre - and postconviction contexts. Cf. Neil Savage, Redesigning Banking with Behavioral Economics in Mind , MIT TECH. REV., Apr. 2011, at 18, 18 -19 (citing behavioral economics for the proposition that where one sets the baseline for conduct matters (e.g., it is easier to convince someone to try something if they have to opt out rather than opt in)). 203 Wilson Interview, supra note 59. 204 See id. 205 See Angel Interview, supra note 146. 206 See id. 207 See id. 2014] THE NEW PROSECUTOR 'S DILEMMA 649 of a postconviction discovery obligation.208 As each of the offices acknowledged, there are significant trade- offs\u2014namely, cost \u2014to an open- DNA -testing policy and an ope n-file policy. Given the volume of frivolous claims that prosecutors receive, the costs of open DNA testing and particularly of file sharing are not insignificant. Nevertheless, a policy of transparency is not only important for detecting the wrongfully convicted,209 but also for the message transparency sends to the public and to prosec utors. While an open -file policy is a closer case, the benefits of an open -DNA - testing policy exceed the costs, for several reasons. First, the costs of an open - testing policy can, to some extent, be cabined. For instance, most offices require the requester to make a showing that the results of the testing sought be actually conclusive as to guilt or innocence prior to footing the bill for the testing. 210 Prosecutors also can imp lement policies that discourage frivolous testing requests: in Dallas County, when an inmate requests DNA testing that ultimately confirms his or her guilt, the district attorney 's office shares information regarding the request and confirmatory result wit h the parole board, and that information may delay ac cess to parole.211 Second, the costs of DNA testing are relatively low \u2014 especially when compared with the costs of litigating a request under the relevant state DNA testing statute.212 According to the Santa Clara County's district attorney's office, the costs of allowing DNA testing are actually lower than the costs of contesting the requests.213 Third, the consequences of contesting an exonerating DNA test are extremely high. A hotly contested DNA exoneration has, in the past, meant the end of a district attorney's tenure .214 It can unnecessarily extend the imprisonment of an innocent individual, and it can delay arrest of the real perpetrator \u2014which may allow the statute of limitations to run on charging the actual perpetrator, not to mention leav e the real perpetrator free to commit additional crimes.215 Fourth, a llowing DNA testing communicates to prosecutors, 208 See, e.g. , Angel Interview, supra note 146; Wilson Interview, supra note 59. 209 See Richard A. Rosen, Reflections on Innocence , 2006 W IS. L. REV. 237, 270 (\"A transparent criminal justice system, one which provides full disclosure of information to the opposing parties in as timely a manner as possible, should help to reduce the number of miscarriages of justice.\"). 210 See, e.g. , Angel Interview, supra note 146; Wilson Interview, supra note 59. If a murder took place in an alley littered with cigarette butts, prosecutors lik ely would not be inclined to pay for testing for each cigarette butt in the hopes that d oing so may provide a lead for an already convicted individual. In other instances, Santa Clara County, for instance, grants requesters access to any DNA testing they choos e, provided that they are willing to pay for it. Angel Interview, supra note 146. If the requester can meet the statutory requirement, of course, he or she can have the state cover the costs. See id. 211 Wilson I nterview, supra note 59. 212 See Angel Interview, supra note 146. 213 See id. 214 See infra note 315 and accompanying text. 215 Jason Kreag, an attorney with the Innocence Project, framed the issue in a request to Clark County District Attorney Steven Wolfson: 650 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 prisoners, defense counsel, and the public that the office is confident in its results but also open to t he possibility of innocence \u2014a move that increases public confidence in the criminal justice sy stem. Given the relatively low costs of testing, high costs of litigation, extremely high costs of contesting a valid request for testing, and benefits to a polic y of openness, permitting access to DNA testing seems to be the clear answer. Open -file discovery is another important component of a postconviction review framework, though implementing an open- file policy presents a much closer case than does DNA testing : the costs are higher and the benefits not as obvious. No jurisdiction grants a petitioner postconviction discovery as of right,216 but de spite that fact, the majority of the conviction integrity programs discussed above ha ve an open- file policy. The policy implemented, in each case, is not without limits \u2014privileged and confidential information is not disclosed by any office, and the requester typically is required to make some proffer of why the requested evidence is relevant to her claim of innocence to ob tain her file.217 Offices also cabin costs by requiring requesters or a representative of the requester to come to an onsite location to view the documents or evidence, rather than tasking someone within the office with the time -consuming job of photocopying files.218 As files become i ncreasingly digitalized, the costs continue to decrease,219 and because offices are increasingly adopting policies requiring prosecutors to include every document and piece of evidence related to the case in the file, the contents of the file will become increasingly accurate as well.220 Finally, as the Criminal Bureau chief from Cook County noted, because in most offices the innocence claim reviewer is required to pull and review the file whenever a claim of actual innocence is receiv ed, the add ed costs of making the file available to the petitioner are not that high. 221 Indeed, searching for confidential, privileged, or relevant materials may actually be a hel pful exercise, forcing the reviewer to look My question is simple: what do you have to lose by consenting to testing? If the results confirm Ms. Labato's involvemen t in the murder, then that would effectively end the case, and Ms. Labat o's conviction would stand. . . . But if the testing identified someone other than Ms. Labato as the murderer, then that result could not only serve as compelling evidence of Ms. Labat o's innocence but also bring the true perpetrator to justice.

Unfortunately, the costs of an open- file policy include more than simply copying or making a file available. However cabined the policy may be, an open - file policy requires already o verwhelmed prosecutors to spend valuable time reviewing case files for privileged and confidential information. In large offices that handle a significant volume of cases, it may be costly and time intensive to pull files from off -site locations and to dis cover the relevant set of files when the trial prosecutor is no longer with the office. And, of course, more often than not, this significant time and energy will be expended for a claim that is entirely without merit. More significantly, postconviction f ile sharing is virtually certain to increase litigation costs. If inmates already are inclined to frivolous claims of actual innocence, providing inmates with case file information is likely to increase the number of claims filed and provide fodder to use in giving claims facial validity. Allegations of Brady violations are also likely to increase where a file contains information that an inmate may not have seen before. Moreover, for the many offices that do diligently provide trial discovery and Brady disclosures to opposing counsel, they are providing inmates with information they already should have received , via their defense counsel , prior to trial. Because an open- file policy is certain to increase inmate litigation, to some extent an open -file policy results in prosecutors subsidizing future frivolous claims with their time and r esources . On the other hand, allowing external review of office files \u2014by inmates or their lawyers \u2014serves as a valuable backstop to prosecutors' efforts to ensure a diligent an d objective review of a case file. First, for the typical indigent, convicted innocent \u2014someone without resources to hire a lawyer or investigator and with no right to a court -appointed lawyer \u2014the odds of uncovering exculpatory evidence without prosecutoria l assistance are remarkably low. 222 Even for those who were adequately represented by counsel in the first instance, postconviction review may be the first opportunity the convicted has to see the inculpatory and exculpatory evidence assembled by the prosecu tor. The inmate's personal knowledge of the witnesses involved, the timing of events, and her own alibi may give her an edge over a prosecutor in terms of identifying relevant exonerating evidence. Moreover, that inmate and her counsel almost certainly hav e more time than a prosecutor to spend reviewing the file. And, of course, innocence projects may also have more resources to devote to case review, if only they could receive access to prosecutors' files. Some innocence projects spend eight months reviewi ng a case file\u2014far more time than a prosecutor is able to spend \u2014and review it with an eye well trained to search for relevant indicators of innocence and consider alternate forensic testing methods. 223 Although the costs of allowing open- file access are 222 See Rosen, supra note 209, at 284-85. 223 Id. For instance, in 2004, a man convicted of rape, kidnapping, and murder was exonerated after seventeen years in prison after new evidence was discovered in his case by Emory Law students who were interning with the Georgia Innocence Project. The county 652 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 certainly high, for prosecutors interested in avoiding injustice and establishing an office po licy that prioritizes innocence seeking, opening their files to inmates in search of exoneration \u2014even the guilty ones \u2014should be an office priority. Offices with an open -file policy view it as essential to ensuring that the public not view prosecutors as trying to conceal bad facts. As the head of the Dallas County Conviction I ntegrity Unit, Russell Wilson , explained, referencing the prosecutor's duty to ensure justice, \"Let's get to the mer its\u2014either it's a good case or not.\"224 By sharing case files and allowing DNA testing, the prosecutor moves away from the adversarial role that often inheres in prosecution by the nature of the investigation, indictment, and trial pro cess, and moves closer to the minister of justice ideal. Creating an office policy of openness to some extent forces prosecutors to put aside the \"defend the conviction\" mentality and accept the consequences of an outside evaluation of the case on the meri ts. That this is true for all cases, not just for those cases where inmates have made some sort of showing of merit or prosecutorial misconduct, also establishes an ethos in the office that openness and disclosure is simply office policy \u2014not an attempt by a postconviction inspector general to delve through the files of hardworking prosecutor s trying to do their jobs. Indeed, a policy of openness with regard to DNA testing and file sharing promotes a mentality within the office more akin to the \"neutral admi nistrative agency\" role advocated by Professors Green and Yaroshefsky.225 This type of o ffice culture makes finding the innocent needle in the haystack far more likely than it would be otherwise. While a policy of transparency is not without significant cost , for those prosecutors truly concerned about righting the wrongs of wrongful conviction, the benefits outweigh the costs. 3. Facilitating Objective Review and Neutralizing Prosecutorial Biases Perhaps most importantly, to recognize a wrongful conviction, prosecutors need objectivity, a legitimate challenge in an environment where conviction statistics often are the measure of a good prosecutor. 226 That challenge is district attorney's office had told Clarence Harrison that all of the evidence in his case had been destroyed, but the interns discovered a slide of the rapist's sem en from the victim's rape kit in Harrison's files, a slide that ult imately exonerated him of the crime.

Lynch, Our Administrative System of Criminal Justice , 66 FORDHAM L. REV. 2117, 2124 (1998)). 226 Id. at 511 (\"Whoever engages in [postconviction review] should not reflexively seek to uphold the prior conviction, but should at least be neutral and open- minded if not, as in the Dallas office, skeptical regarding the legitimacy of the conviction.\"). As Rich ard Rosen has noted, while there must be a presumption of guilt after conviction in order for the U.S. criminal justice system to operate, that rebuttable presumption unnecessarily and unfairly burdens the convicted innocent: \"Because it is now clear that wrongful convictions 2014] THE NEW PROSECUTOR 'S DILEMMA 653 compounded by the fact that the number of valid innocence claims is so low when compared wi th the number of baseless inno cence claims prosecutors must review. A member of the Harris County postconviction review team explained, \"Our job entails prob ably 90 percent failure.\"227 Nevertheless, the conviction integrity units studied all structured the review process to maximize the objectivity and neutrality of the reviewer, first and foremost by ensuring pos tconviction review was directed by an office authority, not by the orig inal prosecutor in the case. The conviction integrity unit prosecutors inter viewed were unanimous in noting the importance of ensuring that postconviction review was directed by an office authority. 228 While data on postconviction review processes (and any internal district attorney offices' processes) are notoriously difficult to obtain, the general wisdom is that in many, and possibly the majority, of prosecutors' offices across the country, postconviction claims of innocence are automatically assigned to the original prosecutor.229 Even in those offices where appellate divisions handle postconviction matters, the original prosecutor is frequently consulted,230 as that individual is considered the office authority on the case. It is possible the prosecutor has information regarding the case that is not included within the case file. Acc ordingly, many offices view that prosecutor as best positioned to defend the convi ction, in terms of experience, personal knowledge, and office efficiency. While this assignment system makes sense as a matter of prosecutorial efficiency, and if the goal is defending the conviction alone, it is counterproductive to determining the validity of the innocence claim. As various scholars have observed, prosecutors have strong institutional, professional, and cognitive incentives that tend toward resisting claims of innocence, particularly when the conviction was one an indivi dual personally obtained.231 For that reason, involving occur, thought should be given to changing those aspects of the system that unfairly burden innocent people who find themselves among the convicted.\" Rosen, supra note 209, at 281. 227 Chin & O'Neil Interview, supra note 83. One can query whether not find ing more innocent petitioners is truly a \"failure,\" since often these investigations \u2014and particularly DNA testing \u2014confirm the guilt of the person already in prison, bolstering the credibility of the criminal justice system. 228 See Angel Interview, supra note 146; Chin & O'Neil Interview, supra note 83; an Interview, supra Interview, supra note 175; Wilson Interview, supra note 59. 229 Green & Yar oshefsky, supra note 18, at 509 n.250; Medwed, supra note 8, at 143- 44. 230 Green & Yaroshefsky, supra note 18, at 509 n .249; Medwed, supra note 8, at 143- 44. 231 Medwed, supra note 8, at 143- 48. Gauging prosecutorial success usually breaks down along the prosecutor's \"win\" (convictio n) and \"loss\" record, and this data is often used in promotion decisions. Medwed, supra note 18, at 44. Moreover, prosecutors generally bring charges against defendants whom they think are guilty, and the affir mation of a jury verdict frequently can boost a lawyer's confidence in the defendant's guilt \u2014a confidence that may be difficult to shake by a convict's assertion of innocence (which often requires additional investigation to confirm). Id. at 45; Medwed, su pra note 8, at 142- 43. In addition, questioning a conviction may cause tension with police investigators with 654 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 the original prosecutor in the postconviction review process often can make objective review of that claim more challenging than it would be otherwise.232 The most effective postconviction review systems isolate the original prosecutor from the investigation until a preliminary opinion has been formed by the r eviewing attorney. In Harris County, prosecutors conduct a full investigation and rea ch a preliminary conclusion before contacting the original prosecutor to solicit his or her views on guilt or innocence.233 While postconviction review prosecutors have reached a preliminary opinion at that time, the conversation with the original prosecutor is far from pro forma.234 The prosecuting attorney's personal experience with the case and its accompanying investigation may yield some information or insight that postconviction review prosecutors have missed. 235 Moreover, if the original prosecutor is conv inced of the inmate's guilt and the reviewer is convinced of the inmate's innocence, engaging in a dialogue with that prosecutor may be us eful in understanding what went wrong in the original case, helping the original prosecutor understand what subsequent evidence has indicated, preparing the strongest possible argument in favor of innocence, and preparing for a pitch to the district attorney or the office's executive management committee. While the original prosecutor may have valuable insight to add (tho ugh often prosecutors will not even remember the prosecution), 236 a fresh set of eyes is key to unbiased review. Not only does the original prosecutor have a vested interest in maintaining the conviction, but her view on the guilt or innocence of the inmate is irrelevant in the postconviction context \u2014the odds are high that the original prosecutor thought the defendant was guilty, or otherwise she would not have brought the case 237\u2014and that view almost certainly would have been validated by whom a prosecutor works, where that investigator is convinced of the defendant's guilt, and pa rticularly where a confession or evidence may have been achieved by investigative overreaching. Medwed, supra note 8, at 144 18, at 45 -46. also is impacted by macrolevel incentives: prosecutors' offices often gauge their own success by their office's overall conviction record, and pol iticians and the electorate consider these factors in assessing prosecutorial effec tiveness. Medwed , supra note 18, at 45. This results in pressure on line attorneys to uphold their convictions and on chief prosecutors to ensure the same. Id. ; see also MEDWED , supra note 119, at 22-25 (discussing various cognitive biases that naturally occur in police investigation and criminal prosecution, including \"confirmation bias\" or \"expectancy bias\" and \"belief perseverance,\" that tend to contribute to tunnel vision on the part of police and prosecutors). 232 Medwed, supra note 8, at 142- 48. 233 See Chin & O'Neil Interview, supra note 83. 234 See id. 235 See id. 236 See Wilson Interview, sup ra note 59. 237 Prosecutors may not bring charges without \"probable cause.\" Green & Yaroshefsky, supra note 18, at 497; also United States v. Barner, 441 F.3d 1310, 1315 (11th Cir. 2006 ). This standard is incorporated in state ethics rules. See, e.g. , MODEL RULES OF PROF'L CONDUCT R. 3.8(a) (2013). Some prosecutor's offices have set a higher standard 2014] THE NEW PROSECUTOR 'S DILEMMA 655 the jury's verdict in the case. Fresh review by a prosecutor not involved in the original conviction, who is looking at the evidence for the first time and evaluating motives, alibi s, and witness credibility without the pressure of public impatience for an arrest, a police inv estigator's belief in the individual's guilt, the ticking clock of the Speedy Trial Act,238 or a looming trial date, may go a long way toward ensuring objective review of a past conviction.239 Of course, even where the original prosecutor is not involved in re viewing a postconviction claim of innocence, collegial relationships can often be an obstacle to unbiased review. When prosecutors are called upon to review the work of their peers or former peers, personal relationships may color their interpretation of t he case or the prosecutorial conduct involved in the case.240 A prosecutor who discovers intentional misconduct or potentially sanctionable conduct when reviewing an innocence claim may be reticent to report it because of the fear of negative implications (s anctions or damage to professional reputation) for a colleague; negative reaction from other prosecutors or police investigators for having second- guessed the decision or reported the misconduct of a colleague ;241 and professional consequences for one's self , should discovery of a wrongful conviction damage office statistics or hurt the reelection chances of the district attorney.242 The challenges inherent in reviewing a peer's conviction underscore the importance of having an office authority engage in the initial review or at least closely oversee the postconviction review process. In Dallas, Harris , Santa Clara, and Manhattan , the initial postconviction review typically is performed by a prosecutor who is the third most senior in the office or a member of the district attorney's management team .243 At that level of seniority and with the established credibility attendant to that position, the reviewer is likely to be less concerned about potential professional consequences resulting from unwinding a conviction, and her concl usions are much more likely to carry weight among line prosecutors and the district attorney. In addition, as someone who is in a supervisory position and therefore is frequently required to evaluate and review other prosecutors' performance, a sen ior prosecutor is less likely to be swayed by peer pressure and the social hazards inherent in investigating a colleague's conviction. Indeed, a long- time prosecutor who has reached the senior ranks of the office likely has experience engaging in pos tmortem review of other prosecutors' mistakes or within their office, however, requiring that the prosecutor be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty. See, e.g., Vance, Jr., supra note 107. 238 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161 (2012). 239 28. 240 Medwed, supra note 8, at 175- 76. 241 The danger exists that conv iction integrity units may be viewed by prosecutors as an office \"inspector general\" \u2014someone constantly looking over prosecutors' shoulders and second -guessing their discretionary choices.

Perhaps most importantly, a senior prosecutor \u2014particularly the third most senior in the o ffice\u2014has direct access to the district attorney, which ensures that her conclusions regarding gui lt or innocence are not filtered by others who may have conflicting incentives with regard to the case being investigated. Of course, having an experienced prosecutor engage in postconviction review comes with its own potential hazards. To be sure, if cyni cism is a problem among prosecutors who review stacks of frivolous innocence claims, presumably a more senior prosecutor, who has spent more years watching the guilty claim innocence, would experience a higher degree of innate skepticism. It may be more di fficult under those circumstances for that person to review an innocence claim with the objectivity and detachment necessary to detect actual innocence. It is for this reason that some have suggested the use of outside advisory committees to review postconviction claims of innocence, 244 and this is perhaps why Dallas County uses defense lawyers to head its conviction integrity unit. On the other hand, most prosecutors' offices across the country lack the resources to hire someone from outside the office to engage in postconviction review.245 Moreover, bringing in someone from the outside \u2014and particularly a defense lawyer \u2014to engage in an oversight function over career prosecutors may result not only in morale problems and division within the office (given the tra ditional cultural- adversarial divide between prosecutors and defense lawyers), but it may make line prosecutors more resistant to postconviction review than they would be if the process were being directed by an experienced prosecutor whom they respected.246 Indeed, the importance of having a senior, highly respected prosecutor leading the postconviction review process was a common refrain among conviction integrity unit directors. 247 Most of the conviction integrity unit prosecutors considered a seasoned prosecutor to be better positioned to assess the validity of an earlier conviction and more likely to have that prosecutor's conclusions regarding guilt or innocence respected by other prosecutors in the office, and, for that reason, better able to create the c ulture of innocence seeking necessary to achieve an effective postconviction review process.248 Whether it is a senior prosecutor or a seasoned criminal defense lawyer at the helm, having a well -respected lawyer with high - level office authority leading any p ostconviction effort is essential to that effort's success.

Tiered Review The three principles outlined above are essential to a strong postconviction review regime, but without a well- defined set of standards to guide the review process itself, post conviction review may still be subject to prosecutorial biases. 244 See Wilson Interview, supra note 59. 245 See Burns Interview, supra note 200. 246 See Valentini Interview , supra note 175. 247 See id. ; Angel Interview, supra note 146. 248 See Angel Interview, supra note 146; Valentini Interview, supra note 175. 2014] THE NEW PROSECUTOR 'S DILEMMA 657 This section creates a clear set of guidelines to direct prosecutorial discretion, a framework that instructs prosecutors on when additional investigation is appropriate, when they should drop opposition to a petition claiming innocence, and when their ethical obligations require active support of an innocence claim. Standardized r eview is essential to an effective postconviction review process; 249 where prosecu tors have no articulable standard t o guide their discretion, the justice they admini ster is likely to vary case by case, based on the prosecutor who reviews it. Where prosecutors rely solely on their instincts to assess the strengths and weaknesses of a case, inherent biases are more likely to play a role in decision making, and racial and socio- economic inequity is more likely to result.250 Such standards are notably absent from the conviction integrity units discussed above. Instead, the effectiveness, efficiency, and accuracy of the postconviction review process rely entirely on the appropriately exercised discretion of prosecutors.251 In describing how each determined what petitions to support, pros ecutors used expressions like \"you know it when you see it,\" \"when it keeps you up at night,\" and \"no scientific formula.\"252 But the problem with the \"you know it when you see it\" standard in this context is that the convicted innocent quite often are in jail because they appeared to be guilty in the first instance \u2014indeed, the ori ginal prosecutor ma y likewise have become convinced of guilt based on a gut i nstinct. Only a small fraction of wrongful convictions are a product of prosecutorial misconduct. 253 Far more often, wrongful convictions occur because well -meaning, dedicated, hard- working prosecutor s simply fail to detect the flaws in their cas es.254 This mistake is even more likely in the postconviction context, where convi ctions are stamped with the authority of a previous prosecutor, a jury, and often multiple rounds of judges (on appeal and in habe as) and where there are a variety of other incentives toward upholding a conviction that the prosecutor may not even detect affecting her judgment. 255 The framework below \u2014derived by combining the experience of conviction integrity units with the experience of convicted innocents \u2014is a first step at 249 See Wilson Interview, supra note 59. 250 As Angela Davis has observed, unfettered prosecutorial discretion lends itself to discrimination and in consistent justice. See DAVIS, supra note 52, at 5. 251 The Dallas Conviction Integrity Unit has been run since its inception by prosecutors who spent their career as criminal defense lawyers, and for that reason they bring to the job a unique set of biases that in some cases may vary fairly dr amatically from those of the typical prosecutor.

There is certain to be disagreement among prosecutors and among scholars as to which standard of proof strik es the appropriate balance b etween the need to ferret out the convicted innocent and the need to protect the many other important functions served by this nation's prosecutors. Most important, though, is that prosecutors adopt some clear framework to gover n prosec utorial discretion, and the below proposal is an attempt to begin a conversation on how the specific contours of that framework should look. 1. Initial Screening Procedures and When Investigation Is Warranted: Stating a Claim of Innocence A cost -effective middle ground for identifying the convicted innocent without wasting prosecutorial resources would require an inmate to state a claim of actual innocence by pointing to either some new evidence not presented to the jury (broadly defined) or a sufficiently serious allegation of misconduct that one might question the integrity of the criminal justice process the petitioner received, a factor that would increase the likelihood that an actually innocent individual had been convicted. 256 Where an inmate \"states a claim\" of this nature, further investigation is warranted.257 And where the underlying case bears the red flags of a wrongful conviction, prosecutors should employ detailed checklists to ensure no new ev idence is overlooked. 258 Moreover, conviction integrity prosecutors cast a 256 Santa Clara also reviews a third category of cases: those brought to its a ttention by credible, well -respected defense counsel. See Angel Interview, supra note 146. There is no doubt th at concerns expressed by reputable, experienced defense counsel about a conviction can be a good indicator of a wrongful conviction. Nevertheless, announcing a policy of investigating \"reputable\" defense counsel concerns raises at least two problems: (1) p rosecutors will end up engaging in their own ad hoc evaluation of credibility \u2014 meaning that in some instances compliant defense counsel will be rewarded with postconviction attention while defense counsel less willing to \"play nice\" will not, and (2) defens e counsel will begin to interpret their duty to represent their clients zealously to include an obligation to raise a pro forma innocence claim with the local district attorney's office. Neither of these scenarios would help conserve resources or serve jus tice. 257 Other innocence -inquiry bodies employ a similar or slightly lower standard. In England, the Criminal Cases Review Commission engages in a screening for \"bare eligibility\" \u2014namely, that the conviction occurred within its jurisdiction and that all app eals be exhausted. Green & Yaroshefsky, supra note 18, at 491 & n.137. Likewise, the North Carolina Innocence Commission conducts an initial screening to determine whether the petitioner is claiming complete fa ctual innocence based on \"credible\" and \"verifiable\" evidence that had not previously been heard. Id. at 492. 258 Research suggests that lawyers can be \"primed\" to focus on certain aspects of their identity (e.g., a prosecutor's \"minister of justice\" role) t hrough reflection and can in this way neutralize cognitive biases that may otherwise impact their decision making. See Cassandra Burke Robertson, Judgment, Identity, and Independ ence, 42 C ONN. L. REV. 1, 45-47 (2009). For that reason, careful review of a c hecklist \u2014and the reflection doing so 2014] THE NEW PROSECUTOR 'S DILEMMA 659 wide net in the claims they are willing to review, even considering claims where statutes of limitations have expired, where petitioners have no postconviction recourse left, and where individuals have pled guilty or state stat utes of limitations on their abi lity to claim innocence have run. Where a petitioner articulates some sort of discernible innocence claim, conviction integrity units engage in further screening to determine whether investigation is needed,259 most often by pulling the individual's case file and communicating with the individual or her attorney by phone or letter, a process that is not terribly time intensive.260 In the case of Harris County, where this screening indi cates the potential for forensic evidence tha t may be persuasive on the question of guilt or innocence, further investigation will be conducted.261 Dallas County imposes a threshold question of whether the innocence claim (or other information in the prosecutor's possessions) indicates the potential fo r new exculpatory evidence, a standard it equates with the required Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) showing in civil cases: D oes the applicant state a cognizable innocence claim?262 If the answer is affirmative, the office undertakes further investi gation. Imposing a \"new evidence\" requirement for additional investigation makes sense from the perspectives of conserving resources, respecting finality, and deferring to a jury verdict, but it only makes sense from the perspective of freeing the convicte d innocent if the term \"new evidence\" is broadly defined. For instance, evidence that could have or should have been discovered by diligent trial counsel does not qualify as \"new evidence\" under some state innocence statutes.263 In the realm of wrongful conv iction, one cannot assume diligent defense counsel.264 In Harry Miller's case, for instance, Miller \u2014who ultimately was wrongfully convicted of ro bbery \u2014had a virtually irrefutable alibi that his attorney was aware of, but defense counsel nevertheless failed t o call witnesses that could substantiate entails \u2014may allow prosecutors to neutralize the cognitive biases that may result in a reflexive decision that an individual is guilty. 259 Many of the letters prosecutors receive never require prosecutors to pull a case f ile or call the claimant in prison because many do not allege factual (or \"ac tual\") innocence, but rather they complain about prison conditions or the sentence received or attempt to reargue the evidence presented to the jury at trial. See Green & Yaroshef sky, supra note 18, at 512. According to former Dallas County Conviction Integrity Director Mike Ware, during his tenure, at least 25% of the claims his office received had nothing to do with factual innocence and could be dismissed with no further effort. See id. at 512 n.259. When it is unclear whether a factual claim of innocence is being made, these offices often call the inmate or send a letter requesting further information, a low -cost process that typical ly screens out ad ditional petitioners. See id. ; Wilson Interview, supra note 59. 260 See, e.g. , Angel Interview, supra note 146; Chin & O'Neil Interview, supra note 83; Wilson Interview, supra note 59. 261 See Chin & O'Neil Interview, supra note 83. 262 See Green & Yaroshefsky, supra note 18, at 512 & n.258. 263 See Brandon L. Garrett, Claiming Innocence , 92 MINN. L. REV. 1629, 1671 (2008). 264 See GARRETT , supra note 19, at 10, 165 -67; GROSS & SHAFFER , supra note 5, at 41-43 (recognizing the role of inadequate defense counsel in wrongful conviction). 660 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 the al ibi, relying instead upon Miller's testimony alone.265 While the testimony of these witnesses was not \"new\" or newly discovered in the postconviction phase, that te stimony demonstrated clearly Miller's innocence and was evidence that the jury that convicted him never heard.266 The U nited State s's indigent defense system is pop ulated by a significant number of skilled, under -paid, diligent defense counsel, but it also contains a number of defense attorneys who are not diligent and whose lack of commitment to criminal cases is only exacerbated by local and state governments' refusal to adequately pay defense counsel.267 Given the deficiencies of the U.S. indigent defense system, it is not realistic to assume trial couns el diligence in determining whether evidence qual ifies as \"new.\" Just as an assumption of trial counsel diligence makes little sense when identifying the convicted innocent, another common \"new evidence\" requirement in state innocence statutes \u2014that to qual ify as \"new\" the evidence must be admissible\u2014would deny exoneration to many of the wrongfully convicted and would put prosecutors in a difficult moral dilemma. There is a great deal of inadmissible evidence that may influence a prosecutor's decision to cha rge an individual and lik ewise a great deal of inadmissible evidence that may influence his or her belief r egarding an inmate's guilt or innocence ;268 this evidence should influence prosecutorial judgment in both instances. Special Assistant District Attorne y Angel enunciated a \"new evidence\" standard that strikes a balance between respecting the finality of a jury verdict, the importance of conserving investigative resources for meritorious cases, and the need to actually exonerate the wrongfully convicted: there \"has to be some new evidence that was not presented to [the] jury already or some really legitimate allegation of misconduct of some sort\u2014(such as the) evidence was there, but something went so wrong that we can't trust [the criminal ju stice] process.\"269 2. When Actual Innocence Claims Warrant Further Investigation: A Bona Fide Dispute as to Guilt Knowing how far to proceed in the investigation process is far more challenging than making the discrete decision to engage in an investigation. In the preconviction context, the Model Rules are silent with regard to investigative directives, and even the more aspirational ABA Prosecution Function Standards discuss investigation in terms of proscriptions (e.g., avoiding invidious discrimination and use of illegal means to investigate) rather than prescriptions for 265 See Stephen Dark, An Innocent Man, SALT LAKE CITY WEEKLY (June 23, 2011), http://www.cityweekly.net/utah/a rticle -35-14164- an-innocent -man.html?current_page=1 . 266 Id. 267 See generally J ON B. GOULD , THE INNOCENCE COMMISSION : PREVENTING WRONGFUL CONVICTIONS AND RESTORING THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM 171- 73, 201 (2007) (discussing Virginia's notoriously underfunded i ndigent defense system). 268 Green & Yaroshefsky, supra note 18, at 500. 269 Angel Interview, supra note 146. 2014] THE NEW PROSECUTOR 'S DILEMMA 661 aspirational ethical conduct.270 While the question involves a significant degree of prosecutorial discretion, one clear guideline prosecutors can apply in deciding whether to continue to pursue exc ulpatory evidence is to question whether a bona fide issue as to the guilt of the petitioner still exists.271 If one views the decision to investigate in the first place as tied to a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) - type standard, the decision to ter minate an investigation could be seen to turn on Federal Rule of Ci vil Procedure 56(a): the investigation ends when there remains \"no genuine dispute as to any material fact .\"272 Of course, knowing whether a dispute is \"genuine\" is the challenge in these cases, a challenge exacerbated by the fact that often the postconviction investigation occurs ten, twenty, or thirty years after the crime originally was committed. Conducting an investigation years after the fact poses very serious challenges. Witnesses may no longer be available, and some evidence not preserved. Prosecu tors may be called upon to make credibility determinations with regard to recanting witnesses and , in doing so, are forced to engage in some degree of second -guessing the jury that initially h eard and believed those witnesses' testimon ies.273 Witness recollections \u2014unreliable under even the best circum - stances \u2014are likely to be further weakened by the passage of time.274 For that reason, prosecutors must que stion how much weight to give a jury verdic t vis-\u00e0-vis their own objective assess ment of the postconviction state of the evidence. There is inherent subjectivity in this type of assessment, which is why Harris County limits its postconviction review to only those cases where objective, definitive f orensic evidence of innocence exists.275 Limiting postconviction review to only forensically resolvable cases, however, would knock out a significant number of cases where individuals clearly merit exoneration. Thomas Haynesworth, the exonerated defendant me ntioned in the Introduction, would not be a free man under this standard. And while nonforensic new evidence poses an exponentially larger challenge for investigators and pros ecutors, there are objective indicia prosecutors can look to in assessing a petitioner's claim of innocence: consistency in accounts;276 the credibility of the 270 See AM. BAR ASS'N, ABA STANDARDS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROSECUTION FUNCTION AND DEFENSE FUNCTION \u00a7\u00a7 3- 3.1 to 3- 3.11 (3d ed. 1993), available at http://ww w.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/criminal_justice_standards/prosecution_d efense_function.authcheckdam.pdf 271 This standard is a variation on one found in the Utah innocence statute, under which, in order to obtain an evidentiary hearing, a petitioner must demo nstrate a \"bona fide issue as to whether the petitioner is factually innocent.\" Miller v.

Indeed, prosecutors can and should inform their nonforensic investigations by educating their attorneys and investigators on the typical hallmarks of wrongful convi ction.278 Prosecutors should engage in the search for evidence of innocence with the same diligence with which they would search for evidence of guilt pretrial, but because they only need worry about convincing their office \u2014not a jury \u2014they can end an investigation where they be come sufficiently convinced of the inmate's innocence. As in the pretrial context, detailed checklists may serve an important role in ensuring that an investigation covers all necessary bases and does not fall prey to tunnel vision. Likewise, train ing prosecutor office investigators, local police, and the local crime lab on co mmon mistakes that lead to wrongful conviction and how to identify such convi ctions may well help these individuals avoid confirmatory bias when engaging in postconviction review. Such training also serves to streamline and reduce the costs of the investigation process \u2014ensuring that not only prosecutors, but their invest igators, know what to look for and how to do so efficiently. Estimating the added costs of engaging in this type of investigation is impossible, because regimes will vary depending upon the caseload and willingness to pay of each jurisdiction, as well as each office's evidence retention policies (those offices that do not r etain evidence from old cases are necessarily limited in their ability to re investigate old cases). Of the conviction integrity units discussed above, Dallas County and Harris County employ two attorneys who work full time on the postconviction review process, typically one senior and one more junior prosecutor. 279 While Dallas Coun ty was able to obtain additional funding to initiate its postconviction program, Harris County simply had to divert resources from other office programs. 280 One could estimate the additional cost for hiring additional prosecutors, plus a full -time investigat or as most programs 277 Id. Of course, New York County District Attorney Cyrus Vance has o bserved that in the two years that the county's conviction integrity unit has functioned, it has not encountered any cases in which exonerating DNA evidence exis ted. See Vance, Jr., supra note 107. 278 See Cynthia E. Jones, supra note 46, at 2927- 29 (identifying four \"leading causes of wrongful convictions \"). There is a signi ficant volume of high -quality scholarship exploring the common causes of wrongful convictions and identifying eyewitness identification, confessions, government informant testimony, and non -DNA forensic analysis of physical evidence as some of the most prevalent causes. That discussion is outside the scope of this Article, but in the past five years, there have been several very interesting statistical analyses done on this topic. See generally GARRETT , supra note 19; GROSS & SHAFFER , supra note 5; PETRO & PETRO , supra note 6. 279 Chin & O'Neil Interview, supra note 83; Wilson Interview, supra note 59. Cf. Valentini Interview, supra note 175 (employing four a ttorneys). 280 See Angel Interview, supra note 146; Chin & O'Neil Interview, supra note 83; Wilson Interview, supra note 59. Cook County also found a way to fund the program internally, without any addi tional resources. See Valentini Interview, s upra note 175. 2014] THE NEW PROSECUTOR 'S DILEMMA 663 have,281 but adopting a full conviction integrity unit is simply not practical for the majority of district attorneys' offices across the country ,282 partic ularly given the public's well -documented underfunding of programs that benefit the incarcerated.283 Postconviction review in other places is bound to look much different. Prosecutors can ration the diversion of resources from ongoing cases to these types of postconviction investigations by tackling innocence claims on a triage basis, with the most serious offenses and longest -incarcerated defendants' cases taken up first . Indeed, this is standard practice for some co nviction integrity units.284 While the costs of postconviction investigation are significant, postconviction investigations do h ave some innate efficiencies over those conducted pretrial. In the pretrial context, police detectives conduct the investigation, select a suspect, and then present the results of their investigation to a prosecutor \u2014a process that often transfers investigative tunnel vision to prosecutorial tunnel vision.285 In the postconviction context, the prosecutor actively directs the investigation from beginning to end (often through its own investigators in offices that employ those). For that reason, prosecutors have a unique ability to ensure that resources are directed only toward the specific nodes of a case that may point toward innocence. And, of course, while police officers often operate without immediate legal direction indicating when and whether they have me t their burden of proof, where prosecutors direct an investigation, they can expand or stop the investigation immediately when the standards set forth in this framework have been met. For instance, where prosecutors are able to confirm guilt ( such as by receiving a confirmatory DNA analysis ) or to confirm the lack of a bona fide issue ( such as by finding d efinitive evidence contradicting a petitioner's specific innocence claim or discovering his or her story directly contradicted by multiple other credible witnesses in the case) , they should conclude the investigation. More importantly, though, the dollars spent on investigation may result in equivalent savings in litigation costs \u2014regardless of whether the investigation reveals additional evidence of innocen ce or guilt. In the face of an explosion of postconviction habeas and actual innocence claims, prosecutors' typical response is to review the case file and the transcripts of a case and refute the petitioner's claims on that basis. This may be effective in securing a speedy dismissal where a petitioner is pro se, but in cases with some merit or where the Innocence Project, pro bono counsel, or diligent defense counsel is involved, the litigation may take years or be accompanied by bruising media attention, and the petitioner may have to work through not only habeas requests, but requests for DNA testing, actual 281 See, e.g. , Angel Interview, supra note 146; Chin & O'Neil Interview, supra note 83; Wilson Interview, supra note 59. 282 See Burns Interview, supra note 200. 283 See William J. Stuntz, The Pathological Politics of Criminal La w, 100 M ICH. L. REV. 505, 570 n.242 (2001). 284 See, e.g. , Angel Interview, supra note supra note 119, at 22 -25. 664 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 innocence petitions, and then litigation over wrongful conviction compensation.286 Some hotly contested cases could be far more quickly disposed of if the prosecution discovered more conclusive evidence of guilt. Further, many of these cases could be disposed of far more quickly \u2014and without the added years of litigation costs, media embarrassment, and wrongful incarceration \u2014by an up -front investment in independent investigation. No doubt prosecutorial funds will be spent i nvestigating more meritless claims of innocence than meritorious ones; but overall, the costs of proactively exploring guilt or innocence may be smaller than the costs of reactively clai ming guilt until the petitioner can prove otherwise. And, of course, this cost -effective response has the added benefit of better serving justice, which is the primary mission of the prosecutor's office. Postconviction review also promises to generate preconviction efficiencies. The discovery of valid innocence claims through postconviction review communicates unequivocally to line prosecutors that wrongful conviction occurs and, further, educates them on the warning signs of a potential wrongful conviction. This in turn improves investigative practices, trial strategy, and office disclosure pol icies. As Dallas County District Attorney Craig Watkins observed about his convi ction integrity unit , \"What we've created is a laboratory where we can study the failure of the system.\"287 Use of lessons learned from that laboratory may help prosecutors' offices weed out indictments that should be dismissed and prosecutors who are not taking seriously their ethical obligation to uphold justice,288 and it may even reveal a p attern of inadequate Brady observance that may require revision of office practices on the front end of the criminal justice system. The office educa tion on wrongful conviction that is likely to accompany adoption of a standardized review framework therefo re offers not only to reduce the incidence of wrongful conviction, but it also offers to reduce resources wasted 286 See, e.g. , Dark, supra note 265; Wade Goodwyn, Free After 25 Years: A Tale of Murder and Injustice , NPR (Apr. 28, 2012, 5:00 AM), http://www.npr.org/2012/04/28/150 996459/free -after-25-years -a-tale-of-murder -and-injustice?ps=rs ; Brandi Grissom, William - son Prosecutor Asserts a Change of Heart , N.Y.

When Actual Innocence Claims Require a Prosecutor to Drop Opposition to Release: A Reasonable Likelihood of Innocence Once an investigation is concluded, the prosecutor faces t he thorny question of what to do and what her ethical obligations require when doubts remain about the conviction's validity. Model Rule 3.8(h) suggests that a prosecutor should \"seek to remedy the conviction\" when \"clear and convincing evidence\" shows the defendant was wrongfully convicted. 289 Green and Yaroshefsky consider the Model Rule s standard too high and assert that a prosecutor should seek an inmate's release upon determining that the defendant is \"probably innocent.\"290 While it is certainly true that \"the state and federal government have an obligation to free innocent individuals,\"291 a question remains regarding how much certainty is required for prosecutors to advocate for release and whether a lesser level of certainty would counsel prosecutors to defer to postconviction judicial processes. This would passively allow convicted individuals to free themselves by not opposing such efforts, rather than bringing the full weight of the executive to bear in favor of their release. This Article suggests a di fference between those two actions on the part of the government, and while Green and Yaroshefsky make a compelling case that the \"probably innocent\" standard is sufficient for dropping prosecutorial oppo sition to postconviction claims of innocence, a higher degree of certainty may be required for active prosecutorial attempts to secure exoneration. The \"probably innocent\" standard that Green and Yaroshefsky propose, which seems to be roughly equivalent to a \"reasonable likelihood of innocence\" standard, 292 may trigger a moral obligation on the part of the prosecutor not to oppose release,293 but it seems to fall short of the level of conviction required to campaign for the release of someone who was convicted by a jury and whose conviction was upheld by multipl e judges. Given the far cry from anything approximating certai nty that \"probably innocent\" denotes, it may not be in the best interest of society, finality, justice, or a prosecutor's political reputation to actively seek to free or exonerate that individu al. While, as discussed below, state statutory innocence standards need not bind prosecutors, where they are only 51 % 289 MODEL RULES OF PROF'L CONDUCT R. 3.8(h) (2013). 290 See Green & Yaroshefsky, supra note 18, at 508. 291 Id. at 505 . 292 Id. at 516 (\"When a prosecutor concludes that a convicted defendant is rea sonably likely to be innocent, the appropriate steps may vary depending on the j urisdiction . . . .\"); see also MODEL RULES OF PROF'L CONDUCT R. 3.8(g) (2013) (imposing an investigatory obligation on the prosecutor where \"new, credible and material evidence creat[es] a reasonable likelihood that a convicted defendant did not commit an offense of which the defendant was convicted\"). 293 See Green & Yaroshefsky, supra note 18, at 516 . 666 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 convinced of innocence, justice may be better served by deferring to the criminal justice process, the jury verdict, and postconviction judicial review procedures rather than substituting an uncertain prosecutor's opinion for their judgments. Conviction integrity prosec utors spoke frequently about the challenge of respecting a jury verdict while engaging in postconviction review.294 Where new evidence causes a prosecutor to doubt a conviction, but further investigation leaves that prosecutor only with the conclusion that the individual is \"probably innocent,\" there is still a very good chance that the convicted individual is, in fact, guilty. A prosecutor should only seek to keep someone in prison when convinced of that person's guilt\u2014just as a prosecutor should only seek to convict an individual of whose guilt the prosecutor is co nvinced295\u2014but a higher standard is required for that prosecutor to actively work toward that individual's release.296 4. When Actual Innocence Claims Require a Prosecutor to Affirmatively A ssist in Release: The Clear and Convincing Evidence Standard As discussed above, there can be a significant difference in both outco me and perception when a prosecutor's office calls for an individual's exoneration versus when a prosecutor drops opposition to an actual innocence petition, and for that reason, it makes sense that a different standard of proof would attach to one outcome over the other. Under Model Rule 3.8(h), a prosecutor must seek to \"remedy\" a conviction when \"clear and convincing evidence\" establishes exis tence of a wrongful conviction.297 Of course, under the Model Rule s, the steps necessary to meet this duty to \"reme dy\" are not, in fact, all that onerous: Necessary steps may include disclosure of the evidence to the defendant, requesting that the court appoint counsel for an unrepresented indigent defendant and, where appropriate, notifying the court that the prosec utor 294 See, e.g. , Chin & O'Neil Interview, supra note 83; Valentini Interview, s upra note 175; Wilson Interview, supra note 59. 295 See generally Bennett L. Gershman, The Prosec utor as Minister of Justice , 60 N.Y. ST. B.J. 8 (May 1988). 296 The ethical challenges associated with determining whether to support a petitioner's request for release or exoneration are often further complicated by generational shifts in prosecutorial cult ure. In offices where prosecutorial culture has shifted from conviction seeking to justice seeking, an investigation may reveal cases that were prosecuted successfully years ago but likely would not be pros ecuted today based on the same evidence. See Valen tini Interview, supra note 175. Again, the question of how to proceed must revolve around the legal standard: if the prosecutor believes the defendant to be \"probably inn ocent,\" he or she likely should not oppo se that individual's release. If the prosecutor is persuaded to a higher degree of certainty, active advocacy may be appropriate, and if the pro secutor is persuaded to a lesser degree of certainty, the prosecutor may be obligated to defend the conviction. 297 MODEL RULES OF PROF'L CONDUCT R. 3.8(h) (2013). 2014] THE NEW PROSECUTOR 'S DILEMMA 667 has knowledge that the defendant did not commit the offense of which the defendant was convicted.298 While these suggested steps may be appropriate to avoid disciplinary action, the presence of \"clear and convincing evidence\" actually dictates a more r obust response for prosecutors committed to serving justice. Setting a higher standard for active prosecutorial support is appropriate both from normative and efficiency perspectives . Normatively speaking, the prosecutor acts as an official representative of the U.S. government. The United States Supreme Court explained in Berger v. United States:299 [The prosecutor] is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done.300 In other words, the actions of a prosecutor carry with them the imprimatur of the sovereign \u2014whi ch is one reason prosecutors are so powerful in the postconviction context. By actively seeking the release of a convicted individual, by joining a motion with the defense as the government did with Haynesworth and Odom, the government is sending the message \u2014as it expressly did in those cases \u2014that those individuals are actually innocent. 301 That mea culpa on the part of the government is not warranted where an individual is \"probably innocent\" or there is a \"reasonable likelihood\" of innocence. Employing a \"c lear and convincing\" standard for active government support is important also from an efficiency and cost perspective. First, given the official mea culpa that attends a joint motion with the government, such motions ultimately may form the basis for a pet ition for wrongful incarceration compensation. Given the significance of the payout that can result, prosecutors should be convinced of an individual's innocence prior to officially acknowledging such innocence. Second, affirmative support of a petition re quires an expenditure of time on the part of the prosecutor's office \u2014far more so than nonopposition to an actual innocence or habeas petition would \u2014and an expenditure of political and public capital. Applying a \"probable\" innocence standard would likely m ean that some portion of the time prosecutors will be expending government resources to free an individual who is guilty. Advocating for such individuals on the basis of just over 50% certainty may cause division within a prosecutor's office, potentially 298 MODEL RULES OF PROF'L CONDUCT R. 3.8 cmt. 8 (2013) . 299 295 U.S. 78 (1935). 300 Id. at 88. 301 See also Medwed, supra note 5, at 1559 (\"Exonerations may also result from prosecutors joining in a defense request to free the inmate prior to a fullfledged evidentiary hearing or opting not to retry a defendant . . . .\"). 668 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 generating resentment toward the postconviction review process and skepticism toward the concept of \"wrongful conviction.\" Pitching innocence to a governor's office where prosecutors have no \"clear and convincing evidence\" at which to point may also reduce the prosecutors' credibility with the governor's office, where typically a very high standard for innocence is required.302 Finally, exonerating the \"prob ably innocent\" may sacrifice the public's trust in the criminal justice system. Where prosecutors are no t completely convinced, the public also is not likely to be completely convinced, and therefore applying supporting innocence on the basis of \"probability\" may engender public distrust in the criminal justice system. In add ition, where prosecutors are not clearly convinced of innocence, they risk being held personally responsible for freeing criminals who may ultimately commit fu rther crime. Indeed, in hotly contested district attorney elections, any question regarding the certainty of someone's innocence p rior to exoneration can become a campaign issue.303 Not only is this potential outcome problematic in terms of public safety, but it also risks triggering public backlash against the exoneration movement, a move clearly counterproductive to justice. IV. THE POLITICAL PROSPECTS OF RESOLVING THE NEW PROSECUTOR 'S DILEMMA Of course, as with any proposal, the structural modifications and the concept of tiered review will not eliminate entirely the problem they address . Nor is perfection the criterion required t o assess the proposal's utility. That said, an open question remains regarding whether prosecutors' offices are likely to adopt a tiered innocence analysis framework, particularly in the absence of a model rule that sets disciplinary consequences for faili ng to meet a certain standard of postconvi ction conduct. While there may be a will to adopt postconviction review procedures in large cities with liberal district attorneys, like Manha ttan and Dallas, one might wonder whether implementing postconviction r eview is a realistic possibility in those jurisdictions where adversarial culture is most entrenched and where skepticism toward innocence claims is at its highest. These are the offices where wrongful conviction is most likely and where exoneration is mos t difficult.304 For those offices where allegations of actual innocence are viewed most skeptically, where prosec utors are most adamant that current office practices are sufficient to ensure that wrongful convictions do not occur,305 and where aggressive prosecutorial 302 Green & Yaroshefsky, supra note 18, at 485 -87. 303 See, e.g., Jennifer Emily, Attorneys Who Oppose Craig Watkins' Re -Election as Dallas County District Attorney Fault Actions of His Conviction Inte grity Unit, DALLAS MORNING NEWS (Nov . 30, 32-33. 305 See, e.g. , Foon Rhee, Commentary: How Innocent People Land in (June 12, 2012), http://www. mcclatchydc.com/2012/06/12/151901/comm entary -how-innocent -people.html (citing one district attorney who explained that she did 2014] THE NEW PROSECUTOR 'S DILEMMA 669 culture is so entrenched that a sea change toward a \"minister of justice\" mentality seems most impossible,306 an embarrassing high -profile wrongful conviction may be most likely. These types of incidents have in some instances created dramatic press ure for reform, even in districts previously adamant about the frivolousness of postconviction review, and they may be sufficient to force prosecutors to embrace a postconviction review system. For other prosecutors' offices, an evolution toward adopting a postconviction review framework is likely to be more gradual. But e ither way, the widespread adoption of postconviction review procedures is not only realistic, but the politics of wrongful conviction are pushing prosecutors in that d irection, some swiftl y and others gradually. A. The Case for Dramatic Near- Future Reform Almost all of the conviction integrity units discussed above were formed in the wake of a public crisis of confidence in the district at torney's office. In Dallas County and Cook County , a series of embarrassing public exonerations galvanized public attention to the need for postconviction reform, essentially requiring a dramatic sea change in how prosecutors review and respond to postconviction claims of innocence. 307 Indeed, conviction i ntegrity has become a hot topic in district a ttorney elections across the country, and a particularly popular campaign promise in counties that have experienced one or more high- profile exonerations in recent hi story.308 Brooklyn DA Kenneth Thompson vowed to resolve an alleged crisis of wrongful convictions during his campaign.309 In Lake County, Illinois, the 2012 Democratic candidate for state attorney made his proposed conviction integrity unit the centerpiece of his campaign.310 In some elections, like that w hich brought Dallas County's Craig Wa tkins to office, not need a formal conviction integrity unit because \"[m]y whole office is an integrity unit\"). 306 See, e.g. , Graczyk , supra note 81 (discussing the legacy of Henry Wade, Dallas County district attorney for thirty -six years, which in recent years has i ncluded nineteen proven wrongful convictions and significant allegations of prosecutoria l misconduct). Some claimed Wade's office had a \"cowboy kind of mental ity,\" though his son disputed the characterization, explaining that Wade was simply \"very competitive.\" Id. 307 See supra Parts II.

Al though Dallas County had long been a conservative, tough -on-crime district, and Watkins was a defense attorney with no prosecutorial experience, he was elected on a platform of restoring public trust in the criminal justice system, the promise of improved conviction i ntegrity a central tenet of his campaign.312 Dallas County had elected conservative, highly aggressive prosecutors for years, but the very public wrongful conviction problems of the county swept Watkins into office and resulted in a complete cu ltural change of that office.313 Watkins's experience demonstrates that even in j urisdictions with an entrenc hed adversarial culture\u2014where there is a focus on \"winning\" rather than \"administering justice\"314\u2014a tidal wave of public opinion can effect cultural transformation. And the public often demands this type of transformation in the wake of particularly egregio us instances of wrongful conviction, as seen in Dallas County in 2007 and more recently in Williamson County, another Texas county still reeling from a high- profile exoneration vigorously resisted by the district at torney.315 311 See, e.g. , Brandi Grissom, Morton Case Is Focus of Williamson County DA Race , TEX.

REV. 1695, 1702 (2000). 315 John Bradley, the district attorney of Williamson County, Texas, recently lost his bid for reelection due to his prominent role in resisting the innocence claim of Michael Morton, a man convicted in 1987 of murdering his wife and whom DNA evidence exonerated in 2010. See Grissom, supra note 311. Bradley was no t district attorney at the time of the conviction but resisted for years Morton's r equest for access to his case file and DNA testing, thereby extending Morton's stay in prison and allowing the real killer (who had subsequently committed another murder) se veral more years of freedom. See id. ; 2014] THE NEW PROSECUTOR 'S DILEMMA 671 Regardless of whether it occurs in a red or blue state, wrongful conviction tends to evoke a visceral, \"this- could- happen- to-me\" response that bridges traditional political and social divides.316 As Professor Abbe Smith observed, \" at least in principle, protecting the innocent is one of th e few things in the criminal justice system that everyone can agree on \u2014the left and the right, defense lawyers and prosecutors, police and the public.\"317 In the wrongful conviction context, the public is not only united by an innate sense of injustice, but by the reality that the prosecution's error also allowed the perpe trator of a heinous crime to go free.318 In a country where the criminal justice system relies largely on elected prosecutors, the increasing incidences of public exonerations \u2014and the public outrage that accompanies them \u2014has triggered a dramatic change in various jurisdictions across the nation and promises to ensure that an increasing number of pros ecutors' offices will adopt postconviction review r egimes. B. An Eventual but Inevitable Tippi ng Point: The Case for Gradual Adoption of Systematized Post conviction Review Not every prosecutor's office will encounter an embarrassing exoneration or become enmeshed in an election where conviction integrity is the central issue, but a gradual nationw ide shift toward systematized postconviction review seems likely nevertheless. The prevalence of DNA testing statutes and innocence statutes ensures that prosecutors will continue to have to grapple with postconviction claims of innocence. 319 As courts increasingly allow habeas petitioners to circumvent procedural defaults in the habeas context where a credible case for innocence has been made,320 more habeas petitioners will claim innocence, and Goodwyn, supra note 286. Morton's conviction was featured prominently in the campaign in which Bradley sought reelection. For example, mixed in with other election signs al ong Williamson County roads were signs with red bandanas tied at the corners, which read, \"Remember Michael Morton Vote No to John Bradley\"; the jury foreman from Morton's trial recorded a campaign ad for Bradley's opponent, referencing the case; and the f amily of the woman murdered by the real killer while he was still at large were actively involved in campaigning for Bradley's opponent.

And, of course, the number of DNA exonerations continues to rise, as the Innocence Project makes its way through a cache of preserved DNA evidence from Virginia crime labs,321 as Dallas County works its way through its own DNA stockpile,322 and as the Color ado Attorney General Office's Justice Review Project uses federal funding to review thousands of Colorado convictions in search of cases that could benefit from modern DNA testing.323 These DNA cases continue to focus the public's attention on the need for postconviction review, and they will continue to punish those prosecutors who have no standardized protocol and no office procedure for dealing with innocence claims. At some point, the stockpile of conclusive DNA exonerations will be exhauste d, and defense lawyers and conviction -integrity -minded prosecutors will be left with only the murkier, more debatable, inherently inconclusive cases of innocence \u2014but this eve ntuality only makes adoption of a standardized protocol more important. Non- DNA ca ses often do not evoke the visceral public response that DNA cases do because there is more likely to be a lack of consensus regarding guilt or innocence.324 For those prosecutors disinclined to reconsider closed convictions, non- DNA cases pose little threat of public embarrassment, even if the prosecutor responds to that claim in a way that is reflexive and unstudied. In other words, the abundance of non- DNA cases\u2014 the vast majority of the exoneration cases that remain undiscovered325\u2014threaten s to derail the st eady progress toward standardized postconviction review that has been achieved over the past ten years. At the same time, these non -DNA cases, because they are far murk ier and less conclusive than DNA cases, are just the type of case for which the review framework proposed above would be most useful, because these are the cases where a prosecutor is most likely to struggle to determine whether further investigation or supporting a petition is warrant ed. 321 See Frank Green, Va.

The debate over prosecutorial postconviction ethics initiated by Professor Fred Zacharias in 2005326 has become a talking point for crusading district attorneys like Cyrus Vance and Craig Watkins.327 These prosecutors are active in their efforts to ensure that the issue remains on the public radar and is a topic of conversation at prosecutorial confe rences and in the media.328 Finally, the spread of innocence projects to law schools across the country ensures that postconviction justice will be part of the ethic of the next generation of prosecutors in this country. While law school innocence projects are not without their critics,329 they teach students the qualities of \"thoroughness and skepticism,\" with the skepticism being directed toward fallible forensics and the occasionally dysfunctional criminal justice system. 330 Innocence projects are more likely to draw future prosecutors than traditional criminal defense clinics, because innocence project participants can avoid the moral choice of whether they are willing to represent the actually guilty 331 (a choice the prosecutorially inclined may be less wil ling to make). And for those future prosecutors not directly involved in on-campus innocence projects, the existence of these clinical programs ensure s they have contact with fellow students who are involved and that they hear about the high- profile exonerati ons in which these innocence projects occasionally are involved.332 Innocence projects across law school campuses are raising awareness 326 See generally Green & Yaroshefsky, supra note 18, at 46 73; Zacharias, supra note 13, at 173 76 (discuss ing a prosecutors' ethical duty to serve justice after a conviction); Luban, supra note 13, at 1617 (proposing expectations for pros ecutors when new evidence suggests a convicted person may be innocent); Medwed, supra note 8 (discussing institutional and political barriers that deter prosecutors from recognizing potentially valid innocence claims); Medwed, supra note 18, at 12532 (arguing for a fuller realization of the minister -of-justice ideal for prosecutors in the postconviction process). 327 See, e.g. , Vance, Jr., supra note 107. 328 See, e.g. , INTEGRITY PROJECT REPORT , supra note 20 (incorporating find ings of the 2011 conviction integrity conference attended by various conviction integrity unit directors, academics, and others); Buntin, supra note 54; Vance, Jr., supra note 107. 329 See Smith, supra note 316, at 326 28 (noting that innocence projects tend to foster a mentality among law students that is counterproductive to indigent d efense). 330 Keith A.

Whether the current generation of prosecutors comes to recognize the merits of systematizing postconviction r eview or not, the work of campus innocence projects is increasing the likelihood that postconviction review will be an important reality for the next generation. The dedicated advocacy of district attorneys like Vance and Watkins and the growing popularity of the innocence movement among the next generation of prosecutors ensure a gradual but steady evolution toward widespread adoption of systematized pos tconviction review. V. CONCLUSION The rise of DNA exonerations has triggered an explosion of postconviction innocence claims, one to which prosecutors across the country ge nerally have been slow to respond. Although the reality of wrongful convi ction is widely understood, most prosecutors ope rate from a default position of resistance to innocence claims, in large part because the overwhelming majority of these claims are, in fact, frivolous. And while prosecutors, as \"ministers of justice,\" are ethically obligated to remedy wrongful convictions, the vast majority of states lack ethical guidelines that mandate pros ecutors do so and assist them in determining how best to do so. As a result, prosecutors across the country face a new dilemma: how to honor the prosecutor's commitment to serving justice by identifying the convicted innocent, without wasting precious resources investigating largely frivolous petitions. This Article attempts to help prosecutors resolve that dilemma, proposing struc tural modifications to prosecutors' offices and a concept of tiered review, or a standardized postconviction review regime that balances prosecutors' ethical duties with the budgetary limitations prosecutors face. Drawing upon the experiences of five convi ction inte grity units, the Article identifies three key components that can be applied by any prosecutors' of fice interested in postconviction review. It also identifies and remedies a notable deficiency in these conviction i ntegrity units: the utter lack of any type of concrete review standard to be applied when engaging in the process of review. The proposal suggests clear standards of review to be used at each stage in the postconviction review process, calibrated to serve ju stice\u2014as prosecutors are obli gated to do \u2014while respecting the budgetary constraints prosecutors face. Use of such standards is essential for ensuring consistency and accuracy in the review process and avoiding racial or socioeconomic discrimination. High -profile public exonerations ha ve drawn attention to the problem of postconviction review and indeed have inspired institution of the conviction integrity units catalogued above. While some might query whether widespread adoption of a standardized postconviction review framework is real istic, the rise in INNOCENCE PROJECT , http://www.innocenceproject.org/Content/Clarence_Harrison.php (last visited Apr. 20, 2014). 2014] THE NEW PROSECUTOR 'S DILEMMA 675 public exonerations and the increased attention prosecutors are devoting to this problem demonstrate how practical this type of review is. Making such review standard practice across the country promises to make a difference not just in minimizing wrongful convictions and facilitating appropriate exonerations, but doing so also has the potential to strengthen prosecutorial efficiency and effectiveness, improve the consistency of justice the accused in this country receive (reducing the in cidence of racial and socioeconomic discrimination), and point prosecutors back t oward their traditional role as ministers of justice. CRIMINALIZING THE TRANSMISSION OF HIV: CONSENT , DISCLOSURE , AND ONLINE DATING Alexandra McCallum * I. INTRODUCTION Ever since Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) was first recognized as a widespread public health problem, policymakers and legal scholars have considered how criminal law should be used to influence the sexual behavior of people with HIV.1 Surely, HIV is a problem that affects the general health, safety, and welfare of citizens. Thus, as m ost cases of HIV are transmitted through sexual conduct ,2 states can regulate this conduct pursuant to their police powers .3 Generally, states that criminalize the transmission of HIV th rough sexual condu ct provide an exception for HIV -positive individuals who disclose their status4 and obtain consent5 from their partners. However, these statutes tend to be drafted broadly and contain ambiguous disclosure and consent language. The ambiguities surrounding t he consent and disclosure exceptions pose novel problems for HIV -positive online daters. Internet dating sites provide a unique medium for an individual to contextually communicate his or her serostatus.6 This raises a question: Within the meaning of the t ransmission statutes, does * \u00a9 2014 Alexandra McCallum, J.D. 2014, University of Utah S.J.

Lastly, this Part explores the world of online dating and the reasons why e -dating may attract those living with HIV. A. The Legal Response to HIV Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is caused by HIV, a virus that is transmitted through sexual fluids, blood, and breast milk.9 The virus was first discovered among homosexual males in California and New York in 1981 .10 As reported cases of HIV escalated and researchers gained a better scientific 7 Scott Burris et al., Do Criminal Laws Influence HIV Risk Behavior?

In September 1987, President Reagan created the Presidential Commission on the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Epidemic to advise the White House on the public health dangers resulting from the spread of HIV/AIDS.11 One year later, the commission released a report on its findings and encouraged states to examine the possible need for criminal statutes specific to HIV transmission.12 Further, by conditioning federal funding for HIV/AIDS prevention programs on the ability of state criminal laws to effectively prosecute the knowing transfer of HIV, the 1990 Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act imposed further pressure on states to criminalize the transmission of HIV.13 By 1993 nearly half of the states had criminal statutes that targeted HIV transmission in some way.14 B. HIV -Specific Transmission Statutes That Target Consensual Sexual Conduct and Provide Disclosure and Consent Exceptions Presently, twenty- four states have criminal statutes that target HIV -infected individuals who\u2014while aware of their HIV -positive status \u2014knowingly engage in consensual sexual relations.15 These statu tes differ in construction with respect to how disclosure of one's HIV -positive status and partner consent are addressed. Fourteen states include nondisclosure and/or lack of consent as an element of the crime and , thus, require the prosecutor to prove the se elements beyond a reasonable doubt. 16 Eight states afford the charged individual the opportunity to 11 James B.

The burden is then placed on the defendant to prove the elements set forth in the statute's affirmative defense provision. These elements vary among the states, but most require the defendant to prove the exposed partner knew the defendant was infected with the HIV, knew the conduct could result in exposure to the HIV, and consented to engage in the conduct with that knowledge.18 Two states' criminal statutes do not m ention consent or disclosure and may leave HIV -positive persons criminally liable for fully consensual acts.19 The possibility that a nonculpable individual will face criminal liability under an HIV -transmission statute is particularly threatening for HIV -positive persons who participate in online dating. C.

One woman described the dilemmas she encountered when revealing her sexually transmitted disease to prospective mates: \"It's confusing, because you don't know when the right time is to tell somebody. Should you be up front and get it over with or wait until the person develops feelings for you? It' s a big ethical problem.\"27 She also explained that when she did reveal this information, the man she was dating would often break it off.28 While some individuals , like the woman above , use niche -dating sites as a way to be upfront about identity, others do just the opposite. As one scholar notes: The online environment permits us to foster a feeling of intimacy, sharing, and connection without the real -time barriers and filters of judgments based on physical appearance, race, occupation, class, and age. This freedom is potentially liberating in that we can transcend social expectations, identity, and typical scripts for our gender, class, and roles, and experiment with alternate models of relating. 29 For these people, Internet dating provides an identity apart from that of an HIV - positive person. Other HIV -positive individuals prefer to reveal or reference their serostatus via online dating profile s to avoid the discomfort involved with communicating this information to partners face -to-face.30 22 Trenton E.

ANALYSIS HIV-transmission statutes targeting consensual sexual behaviors fail to draw a clear line between sex with disclosure and/or consent and sex without disclosure and/or consent. As a result of these ambiguities, situations may arise where the law extends into th e bedroom, criminalizing consensual, private sexual activity. These issues are discussed in turn. A. Disclosure and Consent In the context of sexual relations, the law of disclosure and consent is far from clear. The difficulties in ascertaining disclosure and consent arise from the nonverbal ways people \"negotiate []\" sex. 36 Direction as to what constitutes legally acceptable disclosure and consent has not been provided by statute or jurisprudence. 37 Is verbal disclosure and consent mandated? May di sclosure and 31 See, e.g. , Al Cooper & Eric Griffin -Shelley, Introduction: The Internet : The Next Sexual Revolution , in SEX & THE INTERNET : A GUIDEBOOK FOR CLINICIANS 1, 2 (Al Cooper ed., 2002). 32 See, e.g. , ADULT FRIEND FINDER , http://adultfriendfinder.com (last visited Mar. 13, 2014). 33 HIVAdultDating.com explains to users \" [n]ow it is safe to conduct yourself openly without fear of judgment, here you will feel that peaceful feeling of acceptance.

HEALTH 2014] CRIMINALIZING THE TRANSMISSION OF HIV 683 consent be inferred from the circumstances? Does indicating one's serostatus via an Internet dating profile constitute disclosure? The answers to these questions are uncertain. One scholar noted, \"choosing to run the risk [of HIV exposure] wit h 'informed consent' \u2014disclosure \u2014is morally different from being involuntarily exposed, but in real life disclosure and consent may look more like an avian mating ritual than the negotiation of a business contract . . . .\"38 The discussion below seeks to hig hlight the manifest difficulties in legally ascertaining disclosure and consent in the sexual context. 1. Consent to Exposure Consent has the power to be morally and legally transformative.39 This is particularly true when lack of consent is an element o f the crime itself.40 While consent is difficult to ascertain in the rape context, added difficulties arise in the HIV-exposure context. When determining whether sex was consensual in the rape context, the relevant inquiry is whether the partner consented t o the act itself. Whether there is indicia of p hysical resistance, incapacity, or signs of emotional oppression, signals of nonconsent to an act are more outwardly apparent.41 Professor David Archard writes that consent to sexual relations \"is an act rather than a state of mind.\"42 However , in the HIV -exposure context, consent to a risk is a subjective state of mind. Absent verbal discourse, indicators of consent or nonconsent to a risk are not easily ascertainable. That is, lack of consent to a risk is not revealed through obvious behavioral and physical signals that would place an HIV-positive person on notice that his or her partner does not consent to the risk of HIV exposure. Moreover, a blanket assumption that no partner would consent to the risk of HIV exposure may be inconsistent with an HIV -positive individual's past experiences and understanding about certain sexual behaviors. Indeed, there are many complicated reasons why individuals, including HIV -negative persons, may choose to assume certain health risks\u2014particularly in the context of sexual MATTERS 135, 143 (2009). Indeed \"[b]y legitimating risk -taking via consent and disclosure . . . the law affirms the need to disclose and to gain consent. The problem is that in the absence of a clear understanding of what this means . . . some diagnosed people will place themselves at risk of prosecution.\" Id. 38 Burris et al., supra note 7, at 509. 39 Alan Wertheimer, What Is Consent?

REV. 125, 171 (1994) (\"There are occasionally cases that happen that way, but most of the time the signals that the victim has given, whether verbally or physically, are very clear.

County District Attorney's Office)). 42 DAVID ARCHARD , SEXUAL CONSENT 4 (1998); Wertheimer, supra note 39, at 567 n.16. 684 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 relations and HIV .43 As a result, it is more likely that an HIV -positive person may honestly believe his or her partner consent ed. Without explicit verbal dialogue,44 HIV-positive people look to their surroundings to determine whether their partner consented to the risk of HIV exposure.45 Because consent to the risk of HIV is subjective in nature, the HIV - positive individual must ma ke certain assumptions about his or her partner's consent based on the circumstances.46 Does seeking sex in a bath house equal consent to HIV exposure? . . . If you don't ask, does that mean I don' t have to tell? People may rely on contextual signals, assuming that a partner in a public sex venue who does not insist on safer sex has assumed the risk, or consented to the possibility of infection by engaging in risky behavior wi thout inquiring about a partner' s HIV serostatus. 47 As set forth above, there is a range of circumstances that may give rise to assumptions about partner consent. But when are these assumptions valid at law? And what degree of culpability, if any, should the law attach to these assumptions? The current state of the law on consent in the HIV -exposure context fails to provide answers to these questions. Moreover, HIV-transmission statutes do not account for circumstances where an individual honestly believed his partner consented to the risk of HIV exposure.48 And mistaken beliefs are relevant to an 43 See infra Part III.B.4 (discussing reasons why HIV -negative individuals may accept the risk of HIV exposure); see also Fadhila Mazanderani, An Ethics of Intimacy: Online Dating, Viral -Sociality and Living with HIV , 7 B IOSOCIETIES 393, 400 (2012) (noting the \"complexity of managing risk in the context of intimate relations and HIV,\" and how \"[i]ntimacy and risk management do not, it seems, blend well together\"). 44 Studies sugge st that in some communities, nonverbal negotiation of consent and disclosure is the norm. See ADAM BOURNE ET AL ., RELATIVE SAFETY II: RISK AND UNPROTECTED ANAL INTERCOURSE AMONG GAY MEN WITH DIAGNOSED HIV 19 (2009), available at http://www.sigmaresearch.org.uk/files/report2009d.pdf (\"There were those who were much more direct about disclosing their own HIV status to all partners, as well as always eliciting information about partners' knowledge of their own status. However, they c onstitute a minority of those taking part in this research.\"); Dodds et al., supra note 37, at 142 (\"Analysis within and across interview transcri pts revealed that few men disclosed their status in a clear and explicit manner. . . .

Disclosure of Serostatus Like consent, the measures an indi vidual must take to \"disclose\" his or her serostatus are unclear under state statutes.55 While case law is limited in this area, one Ohio court found that verbal disclosure sufficiently reveals one's positive HIV status; that written, signed, and notarized disclosure is unnecessary; and that after initial disclosure, an individual would not be guilty for any subsequent sexual encounters with that same partner.56 While verbal disclosure may be sufficient, courts have yet to describe it as mandatory. It remains uncertain whether disclosure can be inferred from circumstances. 49 See Kaplan, supra note 8, at 1545 (\"[L]egislatures that determine that reckless conduct should be criminally liable should require the prosecutor to demonstrate that the defendant ignored a substantial and unjustifiable risk of transmission.\"). 50 The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) recommends against the use of criminal law in circumstances where the person \"h onestly and reasonably believed the other person was aware of his or her status through some other means.\" UNAIDS, ENDING OVERLY BROAD CRIMINALISATION OF HIV NON-DISCLOSURE , EXPOSURE AND TRANSMISSION : CRITICAL SCIENTIFIC , MEDICAL , AND LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS 26 (2013) [hereinafter UNAIDS G UIDANCE NOTE]. 51 \"A person acts knowingly with respect to a material element of an offense when . . . he is aware that his conduct is of that nature or that such circumstances exist\" or if \"he is aware that it is practically certain that his conduct will cause such a result.\" M ODEL PENAL CODE \u00a7 2.02 (2)(b) (1985). 52 \"A person acts recklessly with respect to a material element of an offense when he consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct.\" Id. \u00a7 2.02 (2)(c). 53 \"A person acts negligently with respect to a material element of an offense when he should be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct.\" Id. \u00a7 2.02 (2)(d). 54 See infra Part III.C.1. 55 See, e.g., Taylor Craig Newbold, Full Disclosure: Idaho's HIV Disclosure Laws Causing Their Own statute does not stipulate what exactly constitutes disclosure\"). 56 See State v. Gonzalez, 796 N.E.2d 12, 22 (Ohio Ct. App. 2003) (\"A person of common intelligence would understand that verbal disclosure effectively and sufficiently reveals the information. A person of common intelligence would also understand that once the p erson being told hears and comprehends the information, the person is not likely to forget such a significant revelation, and does not need to be told each time before further intimacies.\"). 686 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 The contextual circumstances that contribute to the mistaken assumption of partner consent will likely be the same circumstances that lead to the determination that disclosure is not necess ary. HIV -positive individuals may employ \"a range of proxy behaviours which they believe[] to be a simulation of disclosure, and . . . [will] generate a fair idea of their partners' status.\"57 For example, the \"Code of the Condom\" holds that \"[t]he person w ho assiduously uses condoms has no obligation . . . [to] inform his prospective sexual partners of his HIV status, even when he knows himself to be infected.\"58 In this scenario, the HIV -positive individual's assumption that his partner is familiar with the \"Code of the Condom\" \u2014a community norm \u2014may enlighten his decision that disclosure is unnecessary. The \"Code of the Condom\" raises another important considerati on discussed in detail below; assumptions about community norms influence disclosure. Indeed, individuals living with HIV \"live and work in a complicated array of circumstances,\" and whether the influence of community norms or fear of personal harm, disclo sure may not always be the most appropriate response. 59 Lastly, transmission laws containing disclosure provisions alone fail to adequately protect others .60 Disclosure alone does not ensure that a partner had the information necessary to make an educated c hoice concerning his or her own health. Unlike consent, disclosure can occur without a partner's awareness of the 57 BOURNE ET AL ., supra note 44, at 19. 58 Lazzarini et al., supra note 2, at 249 (quoting David L. Chambers, Gay Men, AIDS, and the Code of the Condom , 29 H ARV C.R.-C.L. L. REV. 353, 353 (1994)). Condom use does not absolve an HIV -positive person from criminal liability in most states. See, e.g. , IDAHO CODE ANN. \u00a7 39- 608 (2011); MO. ANN. CODE ANN. \u00a7 39- 13-109 (Supp. 2013). California, however, provides an exception for condom use. See CAL HEALTH & SAFETY CODE \u00a7 120291 (West 2012). 59 Aziza Ahmed & Beri Hull, Sex and HIV Disclosure , 38 H UM. RTS. 11, 13 (2011). Scholars have noted that in certain situations, nondisclosure may be the product of power imbalances between partners and fear of physical harm. See Kane Race, Framing Responsibility : HIV, Biomedical Prevention, and the Performativity of the Law, 9 J. BIOETHICAL INQUIRY 327, 331 n.3 (2012) (\"The very idea of disclosure assumes that sex takes place face-to-face between partners of equal power and with some impetus to speak.\" (quoting Heather Worth et al., Reckless Vectors: The Infecting \"Other\" in HIV/AIDS Law, 2 SEXUALITY RES. & SOC.

CODE ANN. \u00a7 2903.11(B) (LexisNexis Supp. 2013) (\" No person, with know ledge that the person has tested positive as a carrier of a virus that causes [AIDS], shall knowingly . . .

Awareness , on the other hand, can occur without disclosure.62 As discussed above, risk awareness can be derived from circumstances alone. \" While disclosure is evidence of awareness of risk, the two are not coextensive.\"63 Thus, if criminal -transmission statutes are to protect those powerless to protect themselves from the health risks associated with HIV exposure, disclosure language must be discarded. 3. Burdening Privacy Rights As implied in the previous subsection, neither legislatures nor courts have defined whether verbal consent and disclosure is mandatory. The Internet introduces a platform where serostatus can be communicated nonverbally and consent can be negotiated based on the circumstances. For example, one's presence on an HIV -specific dating site discloses serostatus and contextually communicates consent to exposure.64 Where it is unclear whether the exposure statutes impose a mandatory verbal disclosure and consent rul e, criminal laws may reach priv ate, consensual sexual conduct. As discussed in detail below, there are many complicated reasons why HIV - negative individuals may wish to expose themselves to the virus,65 and the right to privacy under the Fourteenth Amendment may protect an individual's interest to do so.66 The U.S. Supreme Court has held that the privacy right includes an \"interest in independence in making certain kinds of important decisions.\"67 After first identifying the unenumerated substantive -due-proces s right of privacy in Griswold v. Connecticut ,68 the Supreme Court has spent nearly four decades determining its reach.69 Lawrence v. Texas70 served as a \"powerful affirmation of a 61 See Kaplan, supra note 8, at 1534- 35 (discussing various reasons disclosure of HIV status may not by itself reduce the risk of HIV transmission). 62 Id. (without disclosure \"an individual may know her partner's serostatus . . . or may be unsure of a partner's serostatus but be aware of the risk of transmission.\"). But see R. v. Cuerrier, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 371, 372 (Can.) (\"Without disclosure of HIV status there cannot be a true consent.\"). 63 See Kaplan, supra note 8, at 1534. 64 See discussion infra Part III.B.4. 65 See infra text accompanying notes 120- 123. 66 See Roe v.

Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 599- 600 (1977) (citations omitted). 68 381 U.S. 479, 484- 86 (1965). 69 See, e.g. , Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S 558, 567 (2003) (finding that the right t o privacy encompasses the rights of adults to engage in private, consensual sexual conduct); Roe, 410 U.S. at 154 (finding the \"right of personal privacy includes the abortion decision\"). 70 539 U.S. 558 (2003). 688 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 right to privacy.\"71 Lawrence recognized that the right to privacy extended to private , consensual sexual relations.72 Although the Court neither described this right as fundamental nor articulate a level of scrutiny, scholars suggest that laws infringing upon this right must meet some form of heightened scrutiny.73 Assuming laws conce rning the right to private , consensual sexual activity are subject to heightened scrutiny, it follows that \"[t]he means chosen must be more than a reasonable way of attaining\" the state's policy objective. 74 Whether laws implicating this right are subject t o some form of intermediate or strict scrutiny, such laws must be \"narrowly tailored\" to achieve the state's goals.75 In light of the reasoning above, the ambiguities surrounding the consent and disclosure provisions in the HIV -exposure statutes may offend constitutional principles. Because the right to consensual sexual activity is protected , thus demanding some form of heightened scrutiny, HIV -exposure laws need to be narrowly tailored such that only culpable behavior is punished. Online dating sites make nonverbal disclosure and consent possible. With no guiding standards as to whether nonverbal consent and disclosure is legally permissible, prosecutors may bring charges against HIV -positive individuals for engaging in private, consensual sexual activity \u2014constitutionally protected behavior. Given the stigma that already accompanies HIV,76 the chances are greater that wholly nonculpable behavior will become subject to selective, morality -based prosecutions.77 71 ERWIN CHEMERINSKY , CONSTITUTIONAL LAW: PRINCIPLES AND POLICIES 868 (4th ed. 2011). 72 Lawrence , 539 U.S. at 567. 73 Dean Erwin Chemerinsky highlights two reasons why laws implicating the right to private, consensual sexual activity may be subject to heightened scrutiny. First, the Lawrence court relied on past privacy cases where strict scrutiny was applied. Second, the State of Texas's proffered justification for its deviate sexual intercourse law \u2014advancing moral interests \u2014would traditionally satisfy rational basis review.

Consent, Disclosure, and Online Dating The co nsent and disclosure provisions in HIV -transmission statutes disregard the complexities involved in negotiating sex. The Internet adds a new layer of complication.78 As discussed in Part II.C, the Internet has become an important venue for people to meet se xual and romantic partners,79 and many HIV -positive individuals enjoy the conveniences of online disclosure. Given the Internet's popularity as a means to seek partners and the conveniences of online disclosure, it is logical to assume that the Internet wou ld encourage candor and facilitate the effective negotiation of consent and disclosure. However, the Internet forum actually may frustrate these purposes. One study noted how concern among HIV -positive individuals about \"the lack of control they now exerci sed over . . . personal information meant they were now rarely open about their HIV status among friends and acquaintances.\"80 These individuals were reluctant to be candid about their HIV status and safer sex practices on social sexual networking sites.81 Moreover, design features of online dating profiles restructure sexual negotiation, giving rise to new assumptions about a partner's HIV status and normalizing ambiguous disclosure practices.82 For example, one study observed how routine prompting of HIV status on profiles may alter the practices and expectations of those navigating the online dating context.83 \"Where previously, HIV-negative men were encouraged to presume all their sexual partners were potentially HIV -positive and modify their sexual pract ice accordingly, increasingly they are much more likely to presume their partners are HIV -negative unless circumstances (such as reluctance to disclose HIV status) indicate otherwise.\"84 While in some cases, the Internet may break down initial barriers to H IV disclosure and encourage frank discussions about HIV status and partner consent, the Internet itself is often the barrier to these frank discussions.

When it does, users glean the same information from the context (i.e., an individual's HIV -positive status ) and share a common understanding based on this information.85 However, in some instances, context does not speak as effectively as one may assume. In these instances, good- faith mistakes are likely to occur \u2014mistakes about a partner's consent to HIV exposure among them.86 This Note proposes four scenarios where the various problems surrounding disclosure and consent may manifest in the context of online dating. Although these scenarios are hypothetical, they are informed by findings from studies and interviews with HIV -positive and - negative e- daters. The first three scenarios serve to show how various assumptions about online dating community norms may lead to mistakes regarding partner consent. The fourth scenario provides a situation where criminal liability may attach to constitutionally protected private, consensual sexual conduct. 1. Serostatus Displayed on an Online Dating Profile In this scenario, the HIV -positive e -dater \u2014let's call him Bob \u2014posts his serostatus prominently on his profile. Angela, an HIV-negative e- dater does not notice the serostatus and later engages in sexual intercourse with Bob. In this scenario, Bob believes v erbal disclosure is unnecessary because he indicated his serostatus on his online profile.87 He assumes, in good faith, his partner knew he was HIV positive. Bob's assumption that Angela consented to exposure was further informed by one online dating community norm called \"serosorting.\" Serosorting is an HIV - prevention practice88 where individuals select romantic or sexual partners based on those that share an identical serostatus.89 Potential partners may rely on Internet profiles for serosorting.90 Based on Bob's understanding that serosorting is 85 See infra Part III.B.4. 86 See infra Parts III.C.1 -3. 87 According to one study, \"[n]arratives that described Internet cruising suggested that personal profiles eliminate the need to discuss status in person, or even online.\" Sheon & Crosby, supra note 78, at 2112. 88 The Center for Disease Control and Prevention explicitly states that it does not recommend serosorting as a safer sex practice. It cautions, \"[s]erosorting is not recommended because: (1) too many MSM [men seeking men] who have HIV do not know they are infected because they have not been tested for HIV recently, (2) men's assumptions about the HIV status of their partners may be wrong, and (3) some HIV - positive men may not tell or may misrepresent their HIV status.\" Serosorting Among Gay, Bisexual and Other Men Who Have Sex with Men, CTR.

Under these good- faith assumptions, Bob does not disclose his status. Indeed, studies have confirmed that perceptions about a partner's HIV status often influence an individual's decision to disclose.92 As demonstrated in this scenario, assumptions based on e -dating norms and the ability of the Internet to communicate serostatus propagate mistaken beliefs about consent and disclosure. 2. Code -Word Disclosure In this scenario, Ralph, a homosexual HIV -positive e -dater, relies on cultural code words to communicate his serostatutus via his online dating profile. The responding partner, Stuart, is HIV negative and does not understand the cue word Ralph used. Without knowing Ralph was HIV -positive, Stuart engages in sexual intercourse with Ralph after responding to Ralph's Internet dating profile. The use of code language largely results from e -daters' desires to present themselves in a favorable light or to avoid the unsexy conversation accompanying dialog ue about HIV. As one scholar noted, \" because of the self -advertisin g imperative in the online marketplace for sex and romance, ads and representations may be deliberately opaque, euphemistic, ambiguous, and suggestive.\"93 For example, one study found that some e -daters disposed of the box indicating their HIV serostatus on Gay. com (an online dating site).94 Instead they specified that they practiced safe sex \"sometimes,\" instead of \"always.\"95 In a sexier manner, these modifications served as a discrete code suggesting they were HIV -positive.96 An interviewee in the study expressed this sentiment: I don' t disclose. I still just find it very embarrassing I don't mind telling you. It's one of those things. It's not great leading to sex. It' s like putting the goddamned condom on in the first place. There is nothing sexy about discussing you're HIV positive prior to doing the deed . . . if you put 'sometimes' or 'never' for safe sex on your profile, everyone assumes.97 91 See Dodds et al., supra note 37, at 142 (\"Just as disclosure was sometimes ambiguous, so were the practices that some men described as 'ensuring' they knew whether their sexual partners also had HIV. Actually, gaining unequivocal understanding of sexual partners' HIV infection was rare.\"). 92 Robert Klitzman et al., It's Not Just What You Say: Relationships of HIV Disclosure and Risk Reduction Among MSM in the Post -HAART Era 749 93 Fan, supra note 79, at 27 -28. 94 Davis et al. , supra note 30, at 468- 70, 472. 95 Id. at 469 -70. 96 Fan, supra note 79, at 28. 97 Davis et al. , supra note 30, at 470. 692 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 Suggesting serostatus by expressing desire for unprotected sex may be a painless and sexy way for this interv iewee to disclose his status.98 Others m ay use explicit images of unsafe sex to communicate serostatus. Consider the following conversation between an interviewer and interviewee: MD: So how do you present yourself on the website? Do you say you are positi ve? Interviewee: I used to do and I deleted that part of my profile. If people ask me the question I will always tell the truth . If you look at my site, my name and the fact that I say I never pra ctise safe sex and just look at the pictures that I have got posted there. Quite frankly if you have to ask the question then you're being pretty damn na\u00efve . . . . 99 Turning back to our fictional characters, Ralph, in good faith, assumed Stuart understood that practicing safe sex \"sometimes\" constituted disclosure of his serostatus. In other words, he engaged in a \"proxy behaviour[] . . . believed to be disclosure.\" 100 Ralph's assumptions about Stuart's underst anding of online community code and norms informed his decision that disclosure was unnecessary. Ralph's experience is parallel to that of one e- dater who was a respondent in a British study that explored instances of unprotected sex among homosexual men diagnosed with HIV.101 This man recounted an incident where he initially assumed his partner was aware of his HIV -positive status.102 Sensing his partner was not aware of his serostatus, however, the man mentioned he was \"poz\"; his partner then responded, \"[w] hat does poz mean?\"103 The man characterized this experience as a \"learning point\" where he realized that \"even though down on my profile[,] . . . I have to get back to how it used to be where I don't make that assumption . . . .\" 104 His experience highlights how online dating more readily fosters mistaken assumptions about partner consent \u2014assumptions that he would not have made in more traditional social settings. Ralph and the British interviewee communicated serostatus using lang uage they understood to be common parlance in the online dating community.

The Adult Dating Site This scenario concerns Lola and Jack, two individuals who meet on an adult dating site. Lola is HIV positive , and Jack is HIV negative. Without discussing serostatus, the tw o engage in casual, unprotected sex. Given the risks that arise from engaging in casual , unprotected sex with partners met over the Internet \u2014 among them, the risk of contracting HIV \u2014Lola assumed that Jack consented to the risk of exposure. Assumptions about the behaviors of online sex seekers inform the HIV - positive individual's determination of whether disclosure is necessary.105 The risk of HIV infection is heightened when \"[o]nline sex- seekers are more apt to engage in riskier behaviors, such as casual sex and concurrent partnerships.\"106 The Internet also enables \"targeted shopping among searchable personals for someone amenable to riskier modes of sex, such as 'barebacking' \u2014the practice of anal or vaginal sex without a condom.\"107 Lola's assumption that Jack w as receptive to sexual risk -taking with concurrent partners led her to the conclusion that he consented to the risk of exposure. Additionally, Lola's experience with past partners, who all took measures to mitigate the risk of exposure, led her to believe that Jack consented because he did not inquire about her status. Studies show that people acknowledge the risks involved with engaging in casual sex with partners met over the Internet. Around 64% of people ages eighteen to twenty -four have discussed their HIV status with partners met online.108 Meanwhile, approximately 75% of persons aged twenty - five and older inquired about HIV status with online partners.109 An HIV -positive person might believe that because past partners inquired about serostatus110 or used 105 For some individuals, nondisclosure about being HIV -positive or HIV -negative is accepted as a norm in the casual encounter context. For example, consider the comments of this HIV -negative interviewee: \" It must be so impossible to disclose, particularly in a casual situation. I don't think disclosure is a responsibility. It's a bonus. I just think everyone's potentially HIV positive, that's how I deal with it.\" Race, supra note 82, at 11. This man, along with other men interviewed in this study, adhere to the \" traditional policy of assuming any of their casual partners could be HIV- positive\" \u2014a policy \"situated in terms of the norms of non-disclosure that have operated historically in many casual sex contexts.\" Id. 106 Fan, supra note 23, at 554; see also Fan, supra note 79, at 27 -28. 107 Fan, supra note 23, at 554. 108 Mary McFarlane et al., Young Adults on the Internet: Risk Behaviors for Sexually Transmitted Diseases and HIV, 31 J.

In the context of online sex- seeking, an HIV -positive person may believe one's partner has a greater responsibility to mitigate the risks of HIV exposure.112 She assumes that the risks flowing from casual sex with Internet partners are apparent. Furthermore, her experience with past partners, who all took precautions, lend credence to the belief that sexual partners will always inquire about serostatus if they are truly concerned. Under these assumptions, she feels her responsibility to disclose is negated. Indeed, \"[ s]tudies of HIV -positive people who fail to disclose their status to sexual partners indicate that one commonly proffered reason for not disclosin g was that individuals felt a lessened sense of responsibility or concern for the sexual partner in the casual encounter context.\"113 The world of online sex- seeking alters perceptions about rights, r esponsibilities, and disclosure.114 As a result, the Interne t dating site, as a medium for casual sex -seeking, more readily fosters mistaken assumptions about disclosure and consent. 4. Communications o ver an HIV -Specific Dating Site Run a standard Google search using the key words \"HIV\" and \"online dating ,\" and dozens of dating sites targeting the HIV -positive population appear. As discussed above, HIV -specific dating sites permit individuals to reveal their positive status to prospective partners without the discomfort involved with face - to-face disclosure.115 Some of the HIV dating sites even seek to attract potential members by appealing to the fear of disclosure.116 In this context, disclosure occurs nonverbally in two ways. First, presence on the dating site itself may serve as a means of disclosure,117 and second, serostatus may be explicitly revealed on one's dating profile. Thus, membership on an HIV dating site, or serostatus disclosure via profile, replaces verbal disclosure and may discourage frank discussions. 111 See id. at 11 (stating that a number of HIV- negative men found that \"the use of condoms tended to substitute for the need to know their partner's HIV status\"). 112 See Ahmed & Hull, supra note 59, at 12. 113 Fan, supra note 79, at 22; see also Dodds et al., supra note 37, at 141 (finding that some HIV -positive individuals believed that anonymous, casual sexual settings carried a lower risk of prosecution because they assumed that \"people in such environments knew and accepted the risks\"). 114 See Ahmed & Hull, supra note 59, at 12. 115 See supra note 30 and accompanying text. 116 See, e.g ., HIVD ATING , http://www.hiv -dating.org/ (\"If you're looking for love and companionship without the fear of judgment and disclosure, you've come to the right place!\") (last visited Mar. 20, 2014). 117 Profiles on certain HIV -specific dating sites may make no mention of serostatus at all to avoid identification of oneself in terms of an illness.

However, HIV -negative individuals may be active on these sites as well. In February of 2003, an article appeared in Rolling Stone Magazine identifying a practice called \"bug chasin g.\"118 The author described \"bug chasers\" as HIV -negative gay men who actively seek infection from HIV -positive individuals.119 While this practice has been questioned as myth, studies have shown the phenomenon does exist among a minority of gay men.120 In many ways, the subculture is driven by Internet dating forums; \"[t]he Internet has proven itself a powerful tool in linking individuals with similar, and in some cases, marginali sed interests.\"121 The bug -chasing subculture exemplifies the many complicated reason s why individuals accept certain health risks.122 So, why might a person want to contract HIV? Researchers have suggested several themes. First, bug chasers may believe that infection is inevitable and contracting HIV eliminates uncertainty and fosters a sense of relief.123 Meanwhile, others may view sex without condoms as erotic and dangerous.124 Researchers also suggest that bug chasers may pursue infection to escape loneliness or may do so to gain a sense of empowerment by \"preemptively fulfilling . . . negative societal labels.\"125 Given the reasons why an HIV -negative person may seek exposure, this Note proposes one last scenario. Lars is an HIV -positive homosexual male who is active on an HIV -specific dating site. Fearing HIV infection is inevitable, Gu s, who is HIV negative, decides to take control and engage in sexual relations with Lars. Lars believes verbal disclosure is not necessary because his presence on an HIV - positive dating site speaks for itself. He believes responding potential partners are HIV positive or, possibly for one of the reasons discussed above, otherwise willing 118 Gregory A.

Under these assumptions, Lars and Gus never discuss one another's serostatus and engage in private, consensual sexual relations. As discussed in Part II.A.3, private , consensual sexual relations are a protected privacy right under the Fourteenth Amendment. Supposing Gus presses charges, and Lars is ultimately convicted under an HIV -exposure statute, Lars would be convicted of a crime based on the exercise of his own constitutional rights. For purposes of examination, this scenario is presented hypothetically in the Internet dating context. However, there are reported cases where a consenting partner ultimately decides to press charges, often for retaliatory purposes, against an HIV -positive partner .126 It is possible that this scenario has already played out in real life as sexual relations risking HIV exposure generally occur in private and beyond the purview of witnesses. 127 Thus, fact finders are generally presented with \"he said, she said\" testimony at trial .128 C. Suggested Remedies Consent to sexual relations is expressed through action , whereas consent to a risk is a state of mind.129 Without uttering a word, nonconsent to an act can be ascertained by physical indicators. However, in the absence of a verbal exchange, it is difficult to determine nonconsent to the risk of HIV exposure. Invariably, an HIV-positive person will be mistaken about his need to disclose based on misunderstanding about his partner's consent. Where courts have yet to impose a mandate of verbal disclosure and consent, it is tempting to advocate for an affirmative consent and disclosure requirement to rectify problems of mistake. A verbal mandate wou ld be the most effective way to prevent misunderstandings concerning consent to HIV exposure. Aside from the practical considerations surrounding the question of how this approach could be inc orporated into our legal system, 130 imposing a verbal -permission r ule every time an HIV -positive 126 For example, in one reported Canadian case, a woman was charged with aggravated sexual assault for not disclosing her HIV -positive status to her boyfriend when they began dating five years earlier. At some point, they broke up, and the man was charged with assault in response to complaints of domestic violence against the woman. In retaliation, he asserted that she did not disclose her HIV -positive status before they engaged in unprotected sexual relations, although the woman testifi ed that they had used condoms since their relationship commenced. \"In a bitter irony, he was given an absolute discharge with no criminal record despite being found guilty of assaulting her and her son.\" Alison Symington, Criminalization Confusion and Conc erns: the Cuerrier Decision , 14 HIV/AIDS POL'Y & L. REV. 4, 9 (2009); see also B OURNE ET AL ., supra note 44, at 12 (finding that some HIV-positive individuals were fearful of \"retribution from disgruntled ex -partners\"). 127 See Fan, supra note 23, at 574- 75 (discussing the problems with proving consent at trial). 128 Id. at 574. 129 See supra Part III.A.1. 130 Dan Subotnik, Copulemus in Pace: A Meditation on Rape, Affirmative Consent to Sex, and Sexual Autonomy , 41 AKRON L. REV. 847, 857- 59 (2008). It is worth noting that a 2014] CRIMINALIZING THE TRANSMISSION OF HIV 697 individual engages in sexual intercourse \"would impose an excessive degree of formality and artificiality on a dimension of life in which spontaneity is important.\"131 If consent is not negotiated verbally, then it will be neg otiated based on contextual cues and understandings about human behavior. However, these indicators are imperfect sources of information. Thus, there is a strong probability, especially when Internet dating is concerned, that an HIV -positive individual will hold a mistaken , but good- faith, belief that his or her partner consented. As demonstrated above, community norms exist within the HIV Internet dating community. Consequently, there are outsiders unaware of these conventions , and HIV-positive individuals may mistakenly rely on these norms to their detriment. In their current form, the transmission statutes do not distinguish between those who intend harm from those who hold a good- faith belief that a partner consented. The statutes also fail to proportionately assign punishment to those who were reckless or negligent with regard to their partner's consent.132 Accordingly, the possibility for disproportionate punishment results .133 The laws need to be restructured in a way that allocates punishment based on the degree of blameworthiness inherent in the conduct itself. Professor Margo Kaplan recently proposed a sample statute134 that would afford punishment according to a defendant's degree of blameworthiness relative to her partner 's consent. Kaplan's sample statu te reads as follows: verbal mandate would not resolve issues relating to conflicting evidence \u2014the \"he -said, she-said\" problem \u2014that ma y arise in criminal prosecutions under HIV -exposure statutes. 131 Wertheimer, supra note 39, at 574. 132 Kaplan, supra note 8, at 1532 -34. 133 All states with HIV-exposure statutes categorize the offense as a felony with the exception of Maryland and North Carolina . MD. CODE ANN., HEALTH 41A.0202 (2011). 134 Professor Kaplan proposes three changes to the transmission statutes. See generally Kaplan, supra note 8. First, she suggests the statutes should punish in terms of risk creation. This requires juries to consider all the factors that influence the risk to which the defendant exposed the victim, such as viral load and condom us e. Second, she proposes that the prosecution demonstrate the defendant had a culpable mental state as to transmission. Third, she suggests \"a more nuanced approach to consent that focuses on consent to degrees of risk.\" Id. at 1522. 698 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 It is unlawful for an individual (1) [with the purpose of infecting another with HIV] (2) [who is aware of and ignores a substantial and unjustifiable risk that her actions will resu lt in HIV infection of another] (3) [who should have been aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that her actions will result in HIV infection of another] to engage in conduct that creates a substantial and unjustifiable risk of infecting another with HIV. For the purposes of this statute , the word \"creates\" applies only to the degree of risk that the defendant [knows/recklessly disregards a risk/should have known] the victim did not consent to.135 1. Defects Cured Kaplan's statute resolves several issues discussed in this Note. First, th e model statute assigns punishment in relation to the defendant's degree of moral blameworthiness. For example, an HIV -positive defendant who knows his or her partner did not consent to HIV exposure may be distinguished from the defendant who should have b een aware his or her partner did not consent. The defendant who, albeit negligently or recklessly, is mistaken about his partner 's consent may be punished proportionately.136 Statutory construction in this manner avoids the risk of disproportionate punishment. Consider, for example, scenario one where Bob posted his HIV -positive status on his online dating profile but failed to verbally disclose his status to his partner. Here, the jury may choose to convict Bob of a lesser offense based on a negligence stand ard\u2014even though he believed in good faith that his partner knew his serostatus, he should have been aware of the substantial and unjustifiable risk that his partner did not consent to exposure. Second, the statute removes all of the disclosure language. D isclosure alone does not ensure that an exposed partner consciously appreciated the risks of exposure. Punishme nt is centered on the defendant's level of awareness in relation to what his or her partner consented. Awareness of partner consent need not resu lt from verbal exchange alone, and Kaplan's statute permits partners to negotiate consent contextually.137 135 Kaplan, supra note 8, at 1551. 136 Still, as noted by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, \"because of prejudices against people living with HIV \u2014including those from marginalized and stigmatized populations\" \u2014applying standards of recklessness and negligence could be problematic because juries, courts, and prosecutors may find that \"any sexual acts\" by HIV- positive people meet these standards of culpability.

Remaining Flaws While Kaplan's statute cures some of the defects surrounding the consent and disclosure provisions, problems still remain. Nam ely, \" what is unreasonable behavior or unusual risk in one setting or sub- population may not be in another. A jury of sexually active gay men might see a case differently than a jury of straight married people.\"138 Individuals vary with respect to how they perceive risk. First, people regard purely voluntary risks as less threatening.139 Two people who meet on an adult dating website and engage in casual sex may regard the risks of their behavior differently than a juror who would never voluntarily do the same. Second, when sexual activity is concerned, the degree of risk a person identifies will vary depending on the information presented to him or her and his or her understanding of the nature of the relationship involved.140 For example, the HIV-positive individual who is familiar with and informed about the \"Code of the Condom\"141 might find the risk of nonconsent lower than the juror who is unfamiliar with this community norm. Also, an understanding of the complexities that a re embedded in the relationship at issue influences risk perception. Heightened risk perception may result from the conservative juror's inability to understand the complexities of online relationships and community norms. Because the conservative juror do es not understand the nature of these casual, online sexual relationships, she finds the risk of partner nonconsent greater. Lastly, studies demonstrate gender differences in risk perception. 142 Women identify risks as greater and are less willing to tolerat e them than men.143 Therefore, when relying on a juror's determination of what the defendant knew, what risks he or she consciously disregarded, and what risks he or she should have been aware of, how may we bridge the disparity between a defendant and a juror's risk evaluation of nonconsent? There are no definitive answers, but providing the juror with more information is a good starting point. Information can 138 Burris et al., supra note 7, at 509. 139 David Aldous, Risk to Individuals: Perception and Reality , in ON CHANCE AND UNPREDICTABILITY : 13/20 LECTURES ON THE LINKS BETWEEN MATHEMATICAL PROBABILITY AND THE REAL WORLD 53, 56 (2012), available at http://www.stat.berkeley.e du/~aldous/Real -World/draft_book.pdf. 140 Kaplan, supra note 8, see also BOURNE ET AL ., supra note 44, at 7 (indicating that \" [a]fter diagnosis, men's risk perceptions continue to undergo significant changes, influenced by their own emotional state, experience, and information gained as they [made] decisions about being sexually active individuals with HIV\"). 141 See supra note 58 and accompanying text. 142 Nancy Levit, Confronting Conventional Thinking: The Heuristics Problem in Feminist Legal Theory , 28 C ARDOZO L.

As exemplified in the above scenarios, the online dating community maintains its own norms and language that are unlikely to be understood by a community of traditional jurors.145 Information about how online community conventions influence assumptions about partner consent may help bridge the defendant/juror risk-evaluation gap. Educating the jury about these norms may encourage them to assign punishment proportionate to a defendant's blameworthiness. Jury instructions may be an effective means by which to provide this information. As the United States Supreme Court has said, \"[t]he adversary system, with lay jurors as the usual ultimate factfinders in criminal prosecutions, has histori cally permitted triers of fact to draw on the standards of their community, guided always by limiting instructions on the law.\" 146 3. Model Jury Instruction In light of the considerations above, this Note proposes the following model jury instruction: The prosecution is required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant [knew/recklessly disregarded/should have known] [name] did not consent to the risk of HIV infection. When considering whether the defendant [knew/recklessly disregarded/shoul d have known] [name] did not consent to the risk of HIV infection, you are to consider the totality of the circumstances bearing on the defendant's degree of awareness that [name] did not consent to the risk of infection. Consent need not be verbal in all cases. Consent can only occur nonverbally when a reliable context otherwise establishes the victim's consent to the risk of HIV infection. Lastly, you are instructed to consider that defendant and [name] met on an Internet dating website. Like any communit y, Internet dating communities have their own unique norms and language you may be unfamiliar with. You are to consider these factors in determining whether the prosecution has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant 144 See, e.g. , W. Kip Viscusi & Richard J.

Cali fornia, 413 U.S. 15, 30 (1973). 2014] CRIMINALIZING OF HIV 701 [knew/recklessly disregarded/should have known] [name] did not consent to the risk of HIV. If you are not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant [knew/recklessly disregarded/should have known] [name] did not consent to the risk of HIV infection, you must find defendant n ot guilty. The bracketed areas represent the different mental states required147 by the offense charged. Defense counsel should also be encouraged to request the court to instruct the jury on lesser included offenses and mistake of fact when applicable. The instruction is designed to encourage a thoughtful consideration of the various factors that contributed to the defendant's determination that his or her partner consented. It serves briefly to inform jurors about how online daters move within their own community. Knowledge on this matter reminds the jury to consider the factors that bear on how an HIV -positive e -dater may evaluate the risk of nonconsent differently, thereby reducing the risk that a defendant will receive disproportionate punishment. Furth ermore, it reminds jurors that consent to the risk of HIV infection need not be verbal. It is the jury's fact -finding duty to determine if consent to exposure was in fact communicated contextually. Where it may not be apparent to the jury that certain situ ations establish consent by themselves, including this provision in the instruction serves to remind jurors that acquittal may be warranted when the exposed party consents \u2014albeit nonverbally \u2014to the risk of HIV infection. As a result , it decreases the risk that constitutionally protected private, consensual sexual conduct will become subject to punishment. As an example, consider again our characters from scenario one, Bob and Angela. First, the instruction reminds the jury that Angela's consent to the risk of HIV exposure could occur nonverbally. However, the jury must first look at the circumstances, including Bob's online dating profile that revealed his serostatus, and determine whether the context met a level of reliability that could establish Angela's consent and replace the need for verbal communication. Moreover, by requesting that the jury consider Internet dating norms, the instruction asks the jury to examine evidence that might otherwise be dismissed, such as online serosorting practices. The ins truction encourages jurors to examine Bob's culpability in view of these norms and to look beyond their own predilections concerning risk and morality. When a defendant, like Bob, faces charges under an HIV -exposure law based on sexual conduct with a partner met online, Kaplan's narrowly tailored statute, coupled with the model instruction above, minimizes the danger of disproportionate punishment. IV. CONCLUSION The law of consent is a legal anomaly. It focuses not only on the defendant's state of mind, but also on the victim's mindset. Or, rather, what the defendant 147 Kaplan, supra note 8, at 1551. 702 UTAH LAW REVIEW [NO. 3 knew about the victim's mindset. Consent to HIV exposure is consent to a risk, not consent to an act. Consent to an act is more outwardly apparent \u2014signals of nonconsent may include physical resistance, incapacity, signs of emotional oppression, among others . Consent to a risk, however, is purely subjective. Accordingly, there is more room for good- faith mistakes vis-\u00e0-vis partner consent. The risk is only exacerbated by the many nonverbal way s in which individuals negotiate consent and disclosure in the context of sexual relations. Moreover, assumptions about online dating community norms create an additional layer of opportunity for good- faith mistakes. The statutes do not accommodate the pot ential for mistakes as they fail to provide for the varying degrees of culpability held by a defendant relative to his or her partner's consent The ambiguously drafted HIV -exposure statutes offer no guidance on what constitutes legally permissible consent and disclosure; courts have yet to require a verbal mandate nor have they determined whether consent and disclosure may be inferred from the circumstances. Accordingly, criminal -transmission laws may touch private , consensual sexual relations\u2014a privacy right protected by the Constitution. This lack of clarity is particularly problematic in the Internet age where online dating sites facilitate nonverbal negotiat ion of disclosure and consent. With the growing populari ty of online dating between HIV-positive and -negative individuals alike, a greater necessity arises for these ambiguous statutes to be restructured. Kaplan's proposed statute rectifies several problems with these disclosure and consent provisions. However , this statute fails to bridge the gap that exists between the lay juror's risk perception and the HIV -positive e - dater's risk perception of partner nonconsent. This gap may be bridged by informing jurors about e -dating community norms under which the HIV -positive defendant maneuvers. The instruction is designed to encourage a thoughtful consideration of the online community norms that may contribute to the defendant's determination that his partner consented. In their current state, the disclosure and cons ent exceptions are flawed. Regulating behavior as complicated as consensual sexual relations requires careful statutory construction \u2014especially when technology adds an additional layer of complexity. The criminal -transmission statutes' disclosure and consent exceptions need restructuring to account for these complexities. Structural changes to the statutory scheme can help rectify these flaws and ensure that only the truly culpable are convicted. Nearly two decades have passed since these statutes were first enacted. Since th at time, the Internet has dramatically transformed our behaviors and the ways in which we relate to one another. The HIV -exposure statutes must be overhauled in light of these changes. "}
