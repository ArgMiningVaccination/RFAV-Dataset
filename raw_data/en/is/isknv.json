About this book: \"I wrote this book to fill a gap in the literature. Many people asked me to recommend one book they should read to get an introduction to issues in pediatric clinical ethics. I was not happy with the options available, and decided to put together a volume that covered the issues comprehensively and in a manner that was relevant to clinical providers and ethics scholars. This volume provides a practical overview of the ethical issues arising in pediatric practice. The case-based approach grounds the bioethical concepts in real-life situations, covering a broad range of important and controversial topics, including informed consent, confidentiality, truthfulness and fidelity, ethical issues relating to perinatology and neonatology, end-of-life issues, new technologies, and problems of justice and public health in pediatrics. A dedicated section also addresses the topics of professionalism, including boundary issues, conflicts of interests and relationships with industry, ethical issues arising during training, and dealing with the impaired or unethical colleague. Each chapter contains a summary of the key issues covered and recommendations for approaching similar situations in other contexts. Clinical Ethics in Pediatrics: A Case-Based Textbook is an essential resource for all physicians who care for children, as well as medical educators, residents and scholars in clinical bioethics.\" --Dr. Doug Diekema, November 2011. - Related Pages - The Diekema Lab's current research projects focus on ethical issues involving children in the clinical, research and policy environment with a focus on clinical and research decision-making and vaccine hesitancy. - - - Award Name Award Description Awarded By Award Date William G.
