Most people get a rash 1-3 days after they first start feeling sick. The rash can look like pimples or blisters and usually appears first on the face and then spreads to the rest of the body, including the hands, feet, chest, inside of the mouth, genitals, or anus. Sometimes people get a rash first, then other symptoms. Others only get a rash. The rash goes through different stages before healing completely. This usually takes about 2-4 weeks. "}
