Introduction [1](#B1-healthcare-11-01605)], for example, in opioid-sparing pain management [ [2](#B2-healthcare-11-01605)]. However, since 2001, some concerns have been raised regarding herbal remedies in terms of perioperative herb-drug interactions and organ dysfunction [ [3](#B3-healthcare-11-01605), [4](#B4-healthcare-11-01605), [5](#B5-healthcare-11-01605), [6](#B6-healthcare-11-01605), [7](#B7-healthcare-11-01605)], potentially toxic ingredients and heavy metal contaminants [ [8](#B8-healthcare-11-01605)], and the detrimental effects of dual immunomodulation on allergic and autoimmune diseases [ [9](#B9-healthcare-11-01605)]. Female patients with reproductive problems, particularly those undergoing a gynecologic procedure, tended to use herbal medicine [ [10](#B10-healthcare-11-01605)], and those who used certain anticoagulant botanicals close to the surgery date had a higher risk of blood loss during the surgery [ [11](#B11-healthcare-11-01605)]. [12](#B12-healthcare-11-01605)], 16% in New York [ [10](#B10-healthcare-11-01605)], 3.6% in Hungary [ [13](#B13-healthcare-11-01605)], and 14.5% in Turkey [ [14](#B14-healthcare-11-01605)]. In addition, 8%-13% of surgical patients in Hong Kong used traditional Chinese herbal medicine (TCHM) preoperatively [ [15](#B15-healthcare-11-01605), [16](#B16-healthcare-11-01605)]. The American Society of Anesthesiologists recommends that patients using herbal and dietary supplements must inform their anesthesiologists regarding their use and, in some cases, must stop taking the supplements at least 2 weeks before a surgical procedure [ [17](#B17-healthcare-11-01605)]. Nevertheless, patients are often unaware of this recommendation, and furthermore, they may present for emergency surgery. [18](#B18-healthcare-11-01605)], which included a large majority of Chinese herbal remedies (85.9%). Additionally, the 2005 Taiwan National Health Interview Survey revealed that 5.2% of Taiwanese adults self-administered TCHM without an appropriate prescription [ [19](#B19-healthcare-11-01605)]. In a hospital-based survey, traditional Chinese medicine physicians were found to prescribe 4.87 Chinese herbal medicines on average per prescription for outpatients of the Traditional Medicine Department of a conventional Western medical center in Taiwan [ [20](#B20-healthcare-11-01605)]. However, the prevalence of preoperative TCHM usage among surgical patients remains hitherto unclear in Taiwan. Additionally, TCHMs used in Chinese societies is different from herbal medicines commonly used in Western countries [ [5](#B5-healthcare-11-01605), [6](#B6-healthcare-11-01605)]. Hence, we conducted a questionnaire survey to investigate the prevalence of the preoperative use of TCHMs and dietary supplements in terms of the type, source, frequency, concomitant conventional Western medication, discontinuation, and predisposing factors among surgical patients in Taiwan. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Participants and Study Design 2.2. Study Instrument [9](#B9-healthcare-11-01605), [11](#B11-healthcare-11-01605), [14](#B14-healthcare-11-01605), [15](#B15-healthcare-11-01605), [19](#B19-healthcare-11-01605)], but to increase content validity, it was refined by the review committee of seven senior specialists with expertise in traditional Chinese medicine and questionnaire surveys, which consisted of two traditional Chinese medicine physicians, two anesthesiologists, one surgeon, one pharmacologist, and one epidemiologist. To examine test-retest reliability, 18 participants in Taipei, Taiwan were asked to complete a follow-up questionnaire 2-3 weeks after completion of the first questionnaire. The overall consistency of the retest was 90.7%. Test-retest reliabilities were evaluated through the calculation of the intraclass correlation coefficient for each item in scales, with acceptable values of 0.55. Internal consistencies were estimated through the computation of the internal consistency coefficients of the Cronbach's alpha, with the acceptable value being 0.70. 2.3. Data Collection 2.4. Statistical Analysis 3. Results 3.1. General Characteristics of Participants [Table 1](#healthcare-11-01605-t001). Among the 1428 patients, 727 (50.9%) reported frequent or occasional use of TCHM and 977 (68.4%) took supplements before admission, whereas 612 (42.9%) patients took TCHM and supplements concurrently. Among the 727 patients, 329 (53.6%) obtained their prescriptions from traditional Chinese medicine doctors and 189 (30.8%) acquired TCHM from Chinese herbal stores. The common preparations were herbal decoction (42.5%), concentrated scientific Chinese medicine (33.8%), and traditional powder or pills (30.4%). Among all patients, women (59.9%) and those with a high household income (54.8%) tended to use TCHM (p values of <0.001 and <0.05, respectively), and women (74.3%) and those with a high education level (84.9%) and household income (77.4%) had an increased tendency to consume supplements (all p values < 0.001). 3.2. Discontinuation of Traditional Chinese Herbal Medicine or Supplements and Combined Conventional Western Medications [Table 2](#healthcare-11-01605-t002)presents the preoperative use of TCHM and supplements concurrently with conventional Western medications among participants. Among 727 patients taking TCHM, only 127 (17.5%) patients reported to discontinue using it before surgery and 78 (10.7%) patients reported to discontinue using it 4.7 \u00b1 5.1 (1-24) days before the surgery. Furthermore, 47.3% of the 727 patients were diagnosed with at least one comorbidity, and up to 263 (36.2%) patients were taking TCHM and physician-prescribed Western medicine, such as antihypertensive medications (16.2%), analgesics (10.7%), or diabetes medications (6.9%), concurrently for their current diseases or underlying medical conditions. In addition, 359 (36.7%) of 977 patients were taking supplements and physician-prescribed Western medicine concurrently. Regarding underlying diseases, the use of TCHM and supplements was mostly reported by patients with asthma, kidney disease, liver disease, and hypertension before the surgery, and those undergoing gynecologic surgery, otorhinolaryngologic surgery, neurosurgery, general surgery, and orthopedic surgery. 3.3. Commonly Used Single and Compound Preparations of Traditional Chinese Herbal Medicine [Table 3](#healthcare-11-01605-t003)presents the top 10 single and compound herbal remedies used by 90% and 94% of the TCHM users, respectively. The most commonly used compound preparations among the participants were Si-Shen-Tang (consisting of four ingredients, including dried Chinese yam (Dioscoreae rhizome), lotus were used by 350 (48.1%) and 230 (31.6%) patients, respectively. Furthermore, the commonly used single herbs included berry (Lycium sinensis) (54.3%), which are also popular food ingredients in Taiwan. 3.4. Commonly and Less Commonly Used Supplements [Table 4](#healthcare-11-01605-t004), Taiwanese surgical patients did not commonly use supplements popular in Western societies, such as garlic (8.6%), ginkgo wort (0.0%). 4. Discussion 4.1. Major Finding 4.2. Current Recommendations for Preoperative Discontinuation of Herbal Medicines [3](#B3-healthcare-11-01605), [4](#B4-healthcare-11-01605), [5](#B5-healthcare-11-01605), [6](#B6-healthcare-11-01605), [12](#B12-healthcare-11-01605)]. Ang-Lee et al. listed eight commonly used herbal medicines and their perioperative concerns [ [3](#B3-healthcare-11-01605)]. Varied durations for preoperative discontinuation of herbal medicines were recommended, for example, 24 h for kava, 36 h for ginkgo, 5 days for St John's wort, and 7 days for garlic and ginseng [ [3](#B3-healthcare-11-01605)]. In 2003, the American Society of Anesthesiologists issued the educational brochure, Considerations for Anesthesiologists: What You Should Know About Your Patients' Use of Herbal Medicines and Other Dietary Supplements [ [21](#B21-healthcare-11-01605)], which briefly described the trends of herbal medicine use, governmental oversight, potential side effects, and drug-herb interactions; however, it did not provide definite recommendations for the discontinuation of herbal medicine use before a surgery. Furthermore, the Second American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine Consensus Conference on Neuraxial Anesthesia and Antithrombotic Therapy in 2003 stated that the incidence rate of epidural or spinal hematoma after neuraxial anesthesia was not higher among patients who consumed herbal medicines than among patients who did not consume herbal medicines [ [22](#B22-healthcare-11-01605)]. According to the patient educational brochure, Herbal and Dietary Supplements and Anesthesia, issued by the American Society of Anesthesiologists in 2015 [ [17](#B17-healthcare-11-01605)], the sale of herbal or dietary supplements generates USD 27 billion a year, with half of the American population consuming them. The proportions of ingredients in each product are not closely inspected by the US Food and Drug Administration, and therefore, the consumption of these products can increase the risk of adverse effects during the surgery or procedure, including prolonged anesthesia effects, increased bleeding, increased blood pressure, interference with other medications, and heart problems. Patients must inform their anesthesiologists regarding their herbal medicine use during the pre-surgery visit and eventually, in some cases, may have to stop taking herbal and dietary supplements at least 2 weeks before a surgical procedure [ [17](#B17-healthcare-11-01605)]. Currently, no official guidelines from the American Society of Anesthesiologists and the American College of Surgeons in the United States, Hong Kong, and Taiwan recommend the duration for which Western herbal or traditional Chinese herbal medicine use must be discontinued preoperatively. 4.3. Preoperative Use of Western and Chinese Herbal Medicines [10](#B10-healthcare-11-01605), [12](#B12-healthcare-11-01605), [13](#B13-healthcare-11-01605), [14](#B14-healthcare-11-01605)] and 8%-13% in Hong Kong [ [15](#B15-healthcare-11-01605), [16](#B16-healthcare-11-01605)]. Furthermore, up to 80%-90% of the surveyed surgical patients in Hong Kong took self-prescribed traditional Chinese medicine on a daily basis in traditional soups and teas [ [15](#B15-healthcare-11-01605), [16](#B16-healthcare-11-01605)]. In Taiwan, traditional Chinese and Western medicines have been integrated in many conventional Western general hospitals and are covered by the Taiwan National Health Insurance [ [18](#B18-healthcare-11-01605)]. In 2001, 28.4% of 21.6 million valid beneficiaries of the Taiwan National Health Insurance system used traditional Chinese medicine prescribed by traditional Chinese physicians [ [18](#B18-healthcare-11-01605)]. A questionnaire survey conducted in 2018 revealed 37% and 37.3% of the 1200 respondents were prescribed or advised to use Chinese herbal medicine by Western medicine physicians and traditional Chinese medicine doctors, respectively [ [23](#B23-healthcare-11-01605)]. Additionally, 5.2% of the Taiwanese population purchased traditional Chinese medicine without a physician's prescription [ [19](#B19-healthcare-11-01605)]. Among outpatients in a tertiary Western general hospital in Taiwan, Hong-Hwa (5.8%) and Jia-Wey-Shiau-Yau-San (3.8%) were the most commonly prescribed single and compound preparations, respectively, for the outpatients with the main diagnoses of insomnia (15.6%), menopause (5.2%), and constipation (5.1%) [ [20](#B20-healthcare-11-01605)]. In the study Si-Wu-Tang (31.6%) were the commonly used single and compound remedies, which are common ingredients of diet therapy in Chinese societies. The spectrum and use of herbal medicines before surgery in Taiwan are different from those in Western societies. We observed that Taiwanese surgical patients do not usually use supplements that are common in Western societies, such as ginkgo (6.5%), (Lycium immunoenhancing, and hypoglycemic properties [ [24](#B24-healthcare-11-01605)]. Si-Shen-Tang, which consists of dried Chinese yam, lotus seed, gorgon seed, and poria, is the most famous herbal soup used in traditional Chinese medicine to nourish the digestive system. Jujube fruit and Si-Wu-Tang, which Paeonia lactiflora, and Rehmannia glutinosa, strengthen the female reproductive system and have similar multiple effects on health promotion [ [25](#B25-healthcare-11-01605)]. One-third of the presurgical patients in our study consumed herbal medicines or supplements concurrently with prescribed Western medicines. However, constituent pharmacokinetic interactions and toxicity risks of traditional Chinese remedies are limited [ [26](#B26-healthcare-11-01605), [27](#B27-healthcare-11-01605), [28](#B28-healthcare-11-01605)], leading to a lack in definite discontinuation recommendations for compound herbal remedies before surgery. 4.4. Pharmacokinetic Consideration [26](#B26-healthcare-11-01605)], inhibition of the intestinal activity [25](#B25-healthcare-11-01605)], and drug metabolic enzymes and transporters [ [27](#B27-healthcare-11-01605)]. Nevertheless, the extent to which individual ingredients are clinically active and their residual effects on the body are difficult to determine. For example, the pharmacokinetics of ginsenosides, based on its rapid elimination, with a half-life of 0.8-7.4 h in rabbits, suggests discontinuing ginseng use at least 24 h prior to surgery [ [3](#B3-healthcare-11-01605)]. However, the discontinuation of ginseng use for at least 7 days is probably prudent, because ginseng irreversibly inhibits platelets [ [3](#B3-healthcare-11-01605)]. Various reported herb-drug interactions have their pharmacokinetic bases, but their safety profiles are usually limited to animal studies and case reports. The ingredients of blended Chinese herbal medicines are too complicated to identify their additive or synergistic effects. A hospital-based survey in Taiwan revealed that two-thirds of the herbal prescriptions were compound formulae [ [19](#B19-healthcare-11-01605)], and only 19% of the surgical patients in Hong Kong knew the composition of their Chinese herbal prescriptions [ [14](#B14-healthcare-11-01605)]. Therefore, even surgeons and anesthesiologists are unable to identify the components of herbal medicine used by patients in the pre-surgery visit. Patients should be encouraged to obtain a copy of the prescription provided to them by the traditional Chinese medicine practitioner for future reference [ [15](#B15-healthcare-11-01605)]. 4.5. Perioperative Concerns and Predisposing Factors [3](#B3-healthcare-11-01605)]. Many commonly used Chinese herbs, such as ginseng, Danshen, Danggui, ginkgo, licorice, and turmeric, are known to increase bleeding risks due to their pharmacodynamic interactions with platelets and warfarin [ [29](#B29-healthcare-11-01605)]. In a prospective survey in Hong Kong, surgical patients who took traditional Chinese medicine were likely to have a preoperative hypokalemia and prolonged international normalized ratio or activated partial thromboplastin time (adjusted relative risk, 2.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-4.29), however, without significant association with intraoperative or postoperative adverse events, compared with nonusers [ [16](#B16-healthcare-11-01605)]. Another survey in Jamaica reported an increased blood loss (291.7 mL, p = 0.039) in surgical gynecologic patients with the recent use of certain botanicals with anticoagulant properties [ [11](#B11-healthcare-11-01605)]. In the current study, TCHM use was common among Taiwanese patients undergoing gynecologic and otorhinolaryngologic procedures and among those with a diagnosis of asthma. Those with a higher household income or education level may consider the sources for acquiring and knowing these products, which may contribute to an increased tendency to consume TCHM or supplements in the population. Our results highlight the prevalence of TCHM use among these presurgical patients in Taiwan, indicating the need to educate the surgeons, anesthesiologists, and surgical patients in Taiwan regarding the predisposing factors and potential adverse effects of common traditional Chinese herbs. 4.6.
