Objectives: The purpose of this mixed-methods study was to determine the feasibility of wearable overnight lavender aromatherapy skin patches as a patient-directed nursing intervention for 40 patients on an inpatient hematology-oncology unit. Methods: Data were collected during a two-month period using the Lavender Satisfaction Assessment and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale. Patient demographics and open-ended responses were also collected. Findings: After implementing the overnight aromatherapy patches, about half of the participants reported an absence of anxiety or measurable anxiety symptoms, and participants perceived better sleep quality and duration. The results indicate that a nurse- and patient-driven aromatherapy intervention can improve the quality of care on an inpatient hematology-oncology unit. Aromatherapy and essential oils are increasingly popular, particularly among patients with cancer. According to Boehm, B\u00fcssing, and Ostermann (2012), using aromatherapy and essential oils safely may promote sleep and overall wellness among patients in a hematology-oncology setting by decreasing the severity of symptoms associated with anxiety and depression. In addition, previous studies have indicated that using lavender essential oil in the general inpatient population can provide a sense of calm during hospitalization (Boehm et al., 2012; Lytle, Mwatha, & Davis, 2014). Inpatient nursing staff on the hematology-oncology unit at Christiana Hospital in Newark, Delaware, noticed that more patients were bringing various aromatherapy items (e.g., portable diffusers, roller balls, sprays) for use during their inpatient stay. Therefore, to promote healing and a home-like environment, the inpatient nursing staff conducted a literature review to determine existing best practice for aromatherapy use in this patient population. The literature review identified a limited number of articles that focused on the use of aromatherapy in the inpatient hematology-oncology setting, with most studies examining usage only in the outpatient hematology-oncology population (Boehm et al., 2012; Ozkaraman, D\u00fcg\u00fcm, \u00d6zen Yilmaz, & Usta Yesilbalkan, 2018). A research group comprised of clinical nurses was formed on the inpatient hematology-oncology unit to explore the use of lavender aromatherapy as an adjuvant therapy for this patient population. Lavender oil was selected because of its popularity among the patients at this institution and its frequent use in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) (National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health [NCCIH], 2016). Lavender aromatherapy is a well-recognized form of CAM treatment throughout the world (Blumenthal, Goldberg, Brinckmann, 2013). Historically, lavender oil has been used for traditional aromatherapy in various cultures, including Tibetan, German, and Greek medicine (Blumenthal et al., 2000). Lavender has been promoted for its sedative and relaxing properties, as well as its lack of reported contraindications or side effects, and can be aerosolized, ingested, or applied via transdermal patches (Blumenthal et al., 2000; Hanarahan & Odle, 2009; Koulivand et al., 2013). However, some risks with lavender overconsumption have been indicated in the literature. A study by Hanrahan and Odle (2009) suggests that high or chronic doses of lavender essential oil in tea can be nephro- and hepatotoxic. In addition, the NCCIH (2016) has reported that lavender oil can be poisonous if consumed in large quantities by mouth. According to Henley, Lipson, Korach, and Bloch (2007), a possible correlation between lavender aromatherapy and incidence of gynecomastia was suggested in male children aged 7 to 10 years. The gynecomastia resolved in all patients after discontinuing the lavender treatment applications (Henley et al., 2007). In general, aromatherapy with lavender is considered safe, with a very low risk for toxicity (Fontaine, 2011) and noted sedative, antidepressant, and antiemetic qualities (Blumenthal et al., 2000). The American Pharmacists Association also reports that the inhalation of lavender aromatherapy is well tolerated in most patients, with no documented contraindications or drug interactions (Koulivand et al., 2013; Orr & Hume, 2014). The benefit of inhalation patches is that they increase feelings of control in an otherwise uncontrollable environment (Dunwoody, Smyth, & Davidson, 2002), improve sleep, alleviate anxiety, and easily introduce patients to aromatherapy usage (NCCIH, 2016). Sleep disturbances can contribute to decreased functional status; increased fatigue, depression, and pain; and compromised immune function (Dyer, Cleary, McNeill, Ragsdale-Lowe, & Osland, 2016). Patients with cancer often experience insomnia because of unique factors and symptoms, such as abnormal dreams, anxiety about diagnosis and recurrence, night sweats, and issues with positioning during sleep (Die Trill, 2013), and frequently report sleep disturbances that reduce their productivity, concentration, social interactions, and overall quality of life (Flynn et al., 2010). Traditional treatment options for sleep disturbances typically include pharmacologic interventions that are used to induce or prolong sleep and are widely available over the counter or by prescription; however, these drugs often do not improve the overall quality of sleep and can cause difficult side effects, including daytime sleepiness, dependence, and drug tolerance (Wilson et al., 2010). Although patients may prefer nonpharmacologic alternatives for sleep disturbance and insomnia, determining their effectiveness requires additional research (Fismer & Pilkington, 2012). A review of the literature revealed that most research regarding the use of lavender aromatherapy to improve sleep among hospitalized patients was conducted within intensive care or cardiac nursing units and focused on aromatherapy that was administered via inhalation (Boehm et al., 2012; Dyer et al., Pilkington, 2012; Lytle et al., 2014; Ozkaraman et al., 2018). Research on the use of aromatherapy of any kind for sleep disturbances among patients with cancer is limited. A study by Ozkaraman et al. (2018) explored the use of lavender aromatherapy as an isolated fragrance; however, it was performed in the outpatient setting. The study by Dyer et al. (2016) evaluated the use of aromatic sticks for encouraging peaceful sleep among patients with cancer and found that using an aromatic stick overnight was helpful in aiding sleep for 94% of patients. To determine the benefits and safety of aromatherapy use in patients with cancer, Boehm et al. (2012) and Fismer and Pilkington (2012) conducted systematic reviews, with each study finding that small to moderate benefits from lavender aromatherapy have been reported; however, both reviews indicated that the efficacy of lavender therapy is inconclusive. In studies that examined the use of lavender aromatherapy patches, minimal adverse reactions were reported (Boehm et al., 2012; Dyer et al., 2018). Lillehei et al. (2015) noted minor skin reactions in some patients that resolved within 24 hours of patch removal. As a result of the lack of literature focused on the inpatient hematology-oncology population, the purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of wearing lavender aromatherapy skin patches overnight during inpatient stays. The study aimed to examine the use and acceptance of this essential oil as a low-risk and cost-effective patient-directed nursing intervention. The research questions were as follows: Will the inpatient hematology-oncology population be receptive to using a lavender aromatherapy patch overnight to promote sleep and relaxation, and is the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale a feasible tool to measure anxiety in this patient population? This prospective feasibility study used qualitative and quantitative methods to determine the efficacy of a lavender aromatherapy intervention for the inpatient hematology-oncology population (Bowen et al., 2009; Polit & Beck, 2016). Implementation occurred during a three-month period, and data were collected via two survey instruments. Two open-ended questions were used to collect qualitative data and gain insight into patient acceptance and satisfaction with the intervention. In response to a Likert-type question that asked how satisfied patients were with wearing the lavender patch overnight, patients were asked why they felt the way that they did. Patients were also asked if there was another scent that they preferred. The study was approved by the institutional review board of the Christiana Care Health System. All intervention team members completed human subjects training prior to implementation. This study was conducted on the 38-bed hematology-oncology unit at Christiana Hospital. The unit employs 75 staff members. The sample size for this feasibility study was based on the unit's estimated daily census (84 patients) during a three-month period (Polit & Beck, 2016). Patients who (a) were aged 18 years or older, (b) were English-speaking, (c) were cognitively alert and oriented, (d) had a current hematology-oncology diagnosis, and (e) were willing to use a lavender inhalation patch overnight were eligible for the intervention. Patients were excluded if they were participating in another clinical trial or undergoing a stem cell transplantation, or if they reported an allergy or hypersensitive reaction to lavender. Because of the risk for potential estrogen and antiandrogenic interactions from lavender aromatherapy (Henley et al., 2007), patients with estrogen-dependent tumors were only eligible for the intervention if permission was granted by their primary oncologist. All patients with nonhematologic diagnoses who were admitted to the unit were excluded. Because no reliable or valid survey instrument was available to assess the acceptance and satisfaction of lavender aromatherapy use, the current authors developed the Lavender Satisfaction Assessment. Face validity of the instrument was determined by asking a representative sample of patients (N = 5) on the hematology-oncology unit to read each question and verbalize their understanding of the questions and the context of the instrument's assessment. Inter-rater reliability was 100% (Cronbach alpha = 1.2). The assessment asked patients to rate their satisfaction with and likelihood of using a lavender-infused inhalation patch in the future on a scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). In addition, the assessment was used to collect demographic data, including age, gender, and cancer diagnosis. Anxiety was assessed with the GAD-7 scale. The GAD-7 is a highly valid and reliable instrument (Cronbach alpha = 0.89) that was designed to assess anxiety symptom severity and diagnose general anxiety disorder (L\u00f6we et al., 2008). Scores on the GAD-7 range from 0 (absence of anxiety) to 21 (severe anxiety). A score of 0 indicates the absence of anxiety, scores from 1 to 4 indicate the absence of measurable anxiety, scores from 5 to 9 indicate mild anxiety, scores from 10 to 14 indicate moderate anxiety, and scores of 15 or greater indicate severe anxiety. The GAD-7 was selected based on findings in pharmaceutical studies that demonstrate similarities between lavender oil and anti-anxiolytics to improve anxiety in adults (Woelk & Schl\u00e4fke, 2010). The sedative properties and dependence that are often associated with pharmaceutical interventions, such as lorazepam, are not reported with the use of lavender oil in aromatherapy (NCCIH, 2016; Woelk & Schl\u00e4fke, 2010). Therefore, the current authors tested the ability of the GAD-7 instrument to determine the feasibility of assessing anxiety symptom severity scores following the lavender aromatherapy intervention. Each patient in the intervention received a 55 ml lavender-infused inhalation patch to ensure consistency and reliability. Inhalation patches were procured from Bioesse Technologies LLC because of the multiple National Institutes of Health clinical trials completed on the product (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015, 2017). Patients were recruited at the start of the evening shift (3 pm) at the beginning of the three-month implementation period. Interested patients received an informational flyer on the study that listed the potential benefits of lavender aromatherapy. Team members obtained signed consent from each patient and logged his or her participation on a tracking form. Lavender inhalation patches were adhered to patients' gowns or shirts to avoid direct skin-to-skin contact and eliminate the risk for adverse events. Initially, patches were pinned to the patients' clothing so that the patches could not be displaced overnight; however, this step was eliminated when it was determined that the patches were secure enough without the pins. Patches were placed by nursing staff at bedtime (as determined by the patient) and removed the following morning once the patient was awake and active. Depending on the patients' preferred sleep hygiene, patches were worn for about 6-10 hours on average. If a patient wanted to have the patch removed during the night, he or she was instructed to request assistance from the clinical nurse to do so. Therefore, patients were not exposed to any additional risks for adverse events by participating in this study. Following removal of the inhalation patch in the morning, patients completed the Lavender Satisfaction Assessment and the GAD-7 scale. Most patients completed the surveys independently. If needed, the clinical nurse completed the form on behalf of the patient by documenting his or her verbal responses. Following data collection, the quantitative data from the surveys were manually entered by intervention team members into REDCap, version 6.15.9. Qualitative data were manually coded into a Microsoft Excel\u00ae spreadsheet. Descriptive statistical analysis was also completed using REDCap. Qualitative survey responses were manually analyzed to develop a general sense of the information and to reflect on the overall meaning of responses (Creswell & Creswell, 2018). Two researchers completed a word frequency analysis on the data and further refined the identified themes using content analysis techniques. Checking data for transcription errors, discussing potential researcher bias, and employing bracketing techniques helped to maintain methodologic rigor. A qualitative researcher endorsed and validated the analysis process. Additional analysis integrated the qualitative data, using a side-by side comparison, to capture patients' satisfaction with using lavender inhalation patches or alternate patch scents (Creswell & Creswell, 2018). Patients did not receive any compensation for participation in the study nor did they incur any costs. Study costs were covered by the hematology-oncology unit's budget. Because of budget constraints and the necessity to first determine the acceptability of the intervention, inhalation patches were placed for only one night per patient and enrollment was capped at 40 patients. Lavender inhalation patches were purchased directly from the manufacturer at $1.35 per patch. A total of 55 patients were approached for participation in the intervention, with 15 declining because of a dislike of lavender or existing breathing difficulties. Patients who completed the intervention (N = 40) were a mean age of 60 years (SD = 11.5), with a range of 29-81 years. Most patients were female, and variations in age and cancer diagnoses were noted (see Table 1). Diagnoses included both solid tumor and hematologic cancers. Two months into implementation, team members had consented 40 patients, completing the intervention one month earlier than expected. One patient did not complete the post-intervention surveys but did not request to be excluded; therefore, data collected from this patient were included in the analysis. Self-reported GAD-7 anxiety symptom severity scores among patients ranged from mild to severe. The mean score was 5.95 (SD = 5.61), indicating mild anxiety symptom severity (see Table 2). Most patients (n = 28) reported that they were satisfied wearing the lavender inhalation patch and that they would use the patch again, describing the scent as pleasant and relaxing. Some patients indicated that they would prefer alternative scents such as vanilla or citrus. In addition, patients reported that using the lavender patch resulted in longer and more restful sleep. The aim of this feasibility study was to examine the use and acceptance of an aromatherapy intervention involving overnight lavender inhalation patches in patients on in the hematology-oncology setting. No previous studies were identified that examined the use of lavender aromatherapy in this population; therefore, the current authors developed a nonpharmacologic intervention trial that could be offered to patients to ease anxiety, promote restful sleep, and improve outcomes. Although specific outcomes could not be captured because of the feasibility nature of the study, the survey instruments measured anxiety symptom severity and patient satisfaction with this intervention. The mean age of the sample was representative of the unit's typical census. The sample was mostly female (n = 29); male patients were more likely to decline the inhalation patch because of a dislike of the selected scent. More patients with solid tumors participated in this intervention than patients with hematologic diagnoses, which is not necessarily representative of the unit's variable hematology-oncology ratios. Gastrointestinal tumors were the most common solid tumor diagnosis in this sample, followed by genitourinary, head and neck, breast, and reproductive, with the most common hematologic cancer being leukemia. Typically, the census of this unit has higher incidence rates of colon and breast cancers, leukemias, and lymphomas. Although lung cancer is frequently represented in the unit census, patients with lung cancer often require supplemental oxygen secondary to dyspnea. Most patients with lung cancer, therefore, declined participation, citing various respiratory-related concerns. Based on the literature, the intervention team initially did not include patients with estrogen-dependent tumors in this study. However, all oncologists caring for patients in this population permitted their participation and saw no reason for exclusion. Future studies or clinical practice should consider including patients with estrogen-dependent tumors in their aromatherapy intervention. The mean GAD-7 scores for the patients in this sample were lower than the authors hypothesized prior to the start of the intervention. Eighteen patients reported measurable anxiety. According to Die Trill (2013), as many as 30% of patients with a cancer diagnosis develop anxiety. Although some patients reported anxiety symptoms, questions on the GAD-7 scale focused on the frequency of anxiety symptoms occurring during the past two weeks and not on the patients' current state of anxiety. Therefore, the GAD-7 scale failed to adequately capture evidence of anxiety in this population, possibly because of the patients' ever-changing symptom burden, stage in the cancer trajectory, or prognosis. A study by Matthews, Corrigan, and Rutherford (2003) suggests that patients may be hesitant to report anxiety symptoms because of perceived stigmas toward mental health issues. In this study, 16 patients reported mild to moderate anxiety, with only 2 patients scoring in the severe range. Clinicians caring for patients on the hematology-oncology unit indicated that patients' self-reported levels of anxiety and their requests for prescription anti-anxiolytics were incongruent. Based on these results, using a measure that captures state anxiety would be more appropriate to identify decreased anxiety symptoms following aromatherapy. Although the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory measures state trait anxiety, the intervention team was concerned that patients would be unwilling to complete such an in-depth assessment. However, future studies with larger sample sizes may consider this measure to ensure that data are adequately captured. Twenty-eight patients provided positive feedback on the use of a lavender inhalation patch overnight (see Figure 1). Patients perceived that they had enhanced sleep quality, and the lavender scent was described as pleasant, soothing, relaxing, and refreshing. One patient also cited decreased nausea following use of the patch. Two patients reported that the lavender patch did not elicit a response, and four additional patients reported that they found the scent to be overpowering or too strong. Only one patient reported disliking the scent of lavender. Another patient stated a dislike of the length of the aromatherapy treatment. Based on the qualitative findings of this study, patients on the hematology-oncology unit may find that using a lavender inhalation patch decreases their anxiety symptoms and promotes better sleep. Future studies can evaluate the effectiveness of lavender aromatherapy in hospitalized patients in more diverse settings. Using validated instruments, such as pre- and post-intervention surveys, can best establish patient state anxiety outcomes that are associated with aromatherapy. In addition, future studies could compare costs and determine the financial implications of aromatherapy versus traditional pharmaceutical treatments. The size and work schedule of the project team limited the number of days and times during which patients could be enrolled into the intervention. Starting enrollment during the evening hours rather than earlier in the day also influenced patient participation. Daytime staff members had to attempt to enroll patients during the last four hours of their shift, whereas night staff were only able to enroll patients during the first hour hours of their shift. This limited the amount of time that staff members had to enroll patients throughout their entire shift. In addition, the disparity of needs among patients and across the unit limited the project staff's ability to approach more potential participants; therefore, allowing for flexibility during the consent and enrollment process is recommended. Based on qualitative feedback, additional scents should be considered and offered in future trials to enroll more patients who may not prefer lavender-scented aromatherapy. Although the small sample size was adequate for a feasibility study, using a convenience sample limits the generalizability of the results. Additional funding is needed to explore the feasibility of the intervention in a larger, adequately powered sample size. Patients who are administered pharmacologic sleep aids can be subjected to increased mobility restrictions because of the risk for potential side effects such as sleepwalking. Previous studies have indicated that using aromatherapy allows patients to maintain a sense of normalcy and feelings of control in what can otherwise be a powerless and abnormal situation (Dunwoody et al., 2002; Sand, Strang, & Milberg, 2008). Therefore, offering aromatherapy as a symptom management strategy can empower patients by allowing them to self-administer a low-risk therapy to alleviate sleep disturbances, which may lead to improved patient satisfaction and treatment outcomes. Similarly, with the ability to administer a low-cost nonpharmacologic intervention such as aromatherapy, nurses may be empowered by having better control over the delivery of their nursing and patient care. Based on the results of this study, a lavender aromatherapy patch can be a feasible intervention in the hematology-oncology setting. Overall, participants perceived better sleep quality and reported more mild anxiety symptom scores following the administration of wearable overnight lavender aromatherapy skin patches. Implementing a nurse- and patient-driven aromatherapy intervention into existing care practices can be an easy and inexpensive method to improve outcomes for patients in the hematology-oncology population.
