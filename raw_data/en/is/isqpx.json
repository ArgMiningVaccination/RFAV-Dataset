Davis Vision Question Clarification (local ed only) During last month's ABC call, there was a question about whether or not Walmart would be an in-network provider based on a letter rece ived by a member. The letter was from one area doctor who has decided to no longer be an in -network provider with Davis Vision, not that Walmart is out of the Davis Vision network . It is common for a doctor or provider to directly notify patients when they make decisions to join or leave a network. Walmart retail stores and the doctors who work for Walmart are in -network facilities and providers for vision services.

Parks Avenue Nashville, TN 37243 September 26, 2019 Dear Retiree: The purpose of this letter is to provide the 2020 monthly premium for The Tennessee Plan (supplemental medical insurance for retirees with Medicare) coverage you have as a retired state employee, retired public school teacher, retired local education support staff or retired local government employee. The total base premium for this coverage will increase 1.5 percent for 2020. Please note that $140.55 is the base premium before any applicable state support is applied to your portion of the premium that is due. Refer to the premium table below to see how much you pay after the state support is applied. The premiums listed are per covered individual amounts. The state's service-based contribution for retired teachers and state employees will remain at the same levels: $50 for 30 or more years of service; $37.50 for 20-29 years of service; and $25 for 15-19 years of service. Local education support staff and local government retirees are entitled to employer-supported rates only if the chief governing body has passed a resolution which authorized such support. If your premium is paid from your TCRS retirement benefit, it is deducted one month in advance. For example, the January 2020 premium will be deducted from your December 31, 2019, TCRS retirement benefit. If you are billed directly, you will continue to receive a bill one month in advance. For example, the December bill will be for January coverage. If you are paying by automatic bank draft (ACH), premiums will continue to be deducted from your account on the 15th of the current month of coverage. UMR/POMCO will continue to administer this coverage during 2020. To contact the customer service office for UMR/POMCO for information regarding benefits or the status of claims payments, you may call toll-free at 888.477.9307. Information is also available online at umr. com/thetennesseeplaninfo. If you have questions about your monthly premium you may call the Benefits Administration service center at 800.253.9981 and select option 2. Benefits Administration does not support any practice that excludes participation in programs or denies the benefits of such programs on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age or disability in its health programs and activities.

Attachments: AH Nov Diabe tes Cigna Omada Email Proprietary Wellness tip of the month Reduce your risk for diabetes Regular exercise, with a healthy diet, is one of the most important things you can do to help prevent diabetes or delay its onset. Here are some tips to get you started: Talk with your doctor. You may need to have a medical exam before you start an exercise program. Make it a priority. Do moderate to intense activity for at least 30 minutes a day, 5 times a week. Get creative . Why not take the stairs? Or park your car farther away? Instead of sit - down meetings, have walking meetings. Stay active whenever you can. Be consistent. Don't go more than two days without being active. Keep the habit going strong . Build it in. Pick part of your schedule and pin an activity to it. If you're busy, you can exercise in 10 -minute intervals. Every bit helps. Know that everyone is different . What works for one person may not work for another. Just do what you need to do to help yourself succeed .

YMCA Locations No Longer Participating in Fi tness Your Way Network One of the ways we help your employees' live healthy lifestyles is by working with Tivity Health to provide our low -cost Fitness Your WayTM gym membership program. Tivity manages the network of gyms and fitness centers that participa te in this program, and unfortunately, they've let us know that certain YMCA locations will no longer be available to Fitness Your Way members beginning Jan. 1, 2020. This change affects 23 YMCA locations in Tennessee. The good news is that there are stil l more than 200 Fitness Your Way locations in Tennessee, and more than 10,000 nationwide Fitness Your Way locations available to participating members. To let your employees know about this change, Tivity is sending an email to program participants currently using one of the affected YMCA locations the week of Dec. 9, and then a follow -up email the week of Dec. 23. They're also setting up a dedicated phone line just for BlueCross BlueShield of Te nnessee members who have questions about the program or want to find a new place to exercise. And to make up for the inconvenience, Tivity will give Fitness Your Way members who have used a YMCA 50% off their January 2020 dues.
