Incidence: Most common cancer of wom en in US. 212,000 new cases in 2006, with 40,970 deaths (Jemal). Incidence increasing 1-2% annually. Average lifetime risk of developing breast cancer is 10%. II. Epidemiology A. Risk factors 1. Cumulative Likelihood of Developing Breast Cancer, By Age And Risk Factors Relative Risk Coefficient Risk Factors Age 1 2 5 1 Menarche 14y, no breast biopsies, first 20-40 0.5% 1.0% 3.2% breast 50-70 3.2% 6.4% 15.1% cancer, one relative with breast 5.9% 14.0% Assumes well screened population 2. Risk of positive family history, between ages 30-70 Mother or Sister's Lesion risk factors: endometrial/ovarian cancer, prior radiation exposure, atypical benign breast disease (ductal or lobular hy perplasia), obesity, low parity, early menarche, socioeconomic status B. Etiology. Estrogen, progesterone, prolactin im plicated. Two temporal sets of etiologies: 1. Premenopausal cancers influenced by genetic linkage, and ovarian-pituitary dysfunction. Several pedigrees exist: site s pecific, breast-ovary, and Lynch II family cancer syndrome. Genes BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 implicated in many familial cases 2. Postmenopausal cancers influenced by obes ity, dietary fat intake, and hormones. III. Pathology A. Benign lesions 1. Nipple discharge. Present in 75% of wom en. Discharge associated cancer: serous discharge (6%), bloody di scharge (13-20%). Evaluate suspicious discharge with ductogram and excision. Cytology rarely helpful. 2. Fibrocystic change. Present in up to 75% of women. No longer considered an accurate diagnostic term. 3. Cysts. Common during reproductive years. Probably develop due to estrogen. Evaluate palpable mass by FNA. If clear fl uid obtained without residual mass, then repeat exam in 1 month. If bloody fluid obtai ned, or if mass persists, submit cytology specimen, order mammogram, and perform biopsy. 4. Fibroadenoma. Most common benign tumor of breast. Peak incidence age 20-30. Usually firm, well circumscribed, and solitary. FNA often diagnostic. Phylloides tumors can mimic fibroadenoma. Lobular CIS r eported in these tumors occasionally. Biopsy appropriate. Gyn Onc Overview , Page 2 R. Kevin Reynolds, MD 2. Papilloma, intraductal. Associated wit h bloody discharge. Palpable subareolar lesions in 30%. Evaluate with ductogram and excision. B. Premalignant lesions. May be either precursors or marker lesions. B. In-Situ Lesions 1. Ductal carcinoma in situ. Average age 55y. Represents 10-20% of new breast cancers. Often multifocal: up to 60% have residual DCIS after biopsy, 12% associated with cancer in contralateral breast , and 21-30% associated with cancer in ipsilateral breast. Lifetime breast cancer risk increased 10x. Treatment controversial. Options include excisi on +/- radiation, or mastectomy. 2. Lobular carcinoma in situ. Average age 45y. Usually an incidental finding (not detected on clinical or mammogram exa m) in premenopausal women. Multifocal: 60- 90% have LCIS after associated with LCIS in contralateral breast, and 25% associated with cancer in ei ther breast (usually ductal). Treatment controversial. Options include bilateral ma stectomy, or excision with close followup. C. Malignant lesions 1. Ductal carcinoma a. Infiltrating ductal carcinoma: 80% of breast cancers (53% pure, 28% mixed patterns). Arise in myoepithelial cells around duct. Marked desmoplastic response can cause skin dimple or nipple re traction. In inflammatory carcinoma, a poor-prognosis subtype, dermal lymphatics contain tumor. b. Comedocarcinoma: intraductal tumor. c. Medullary 6% of breast canc ers. Arise in ductal epithelium. Tumors bulky, soft, often necrotic. Less likely to spread than infiltrating ductal tumors. Prognosis good (85-90% 5y survival). d. Papillary carcinoma: < 1% of breast cancers. Commonly involves multiple ducts. e. Colloid carcinoma: < 1% of breast canc ers. Bulky, gelatinous, tumors with relatively good prognosis. 2. Lobular carcinoma: 5% of breast cancers. Arise in acinar cells and terminal ducts. Usually multicentric. 3. Paget's disease: 2% of breast cancers. Arises from mammary ducts. Clinical appearance of eczematoid nipple. 4. Sarcoma: < 1% of breast cancers. Cystosarcoma phylloides has benign and malignant types, and is most common sarcoma of breast. Metastases rare. Treatment usually simple mastectomy. IV. Diagnosis A. Evaluation of a palpable mass Palpable mass < 30 years old > 30 years old, Premenopause Post- menopause Breast Ultrasound Mammogram if Biopsy B. Screening Gyn Onc Overview , Page 3 R. Kevin Reynolds, MD 1. Breast examination. Most breast canc ers present as palpable mass. 10-15% of cancers detectable only by clinical exam. Best to examine shortly after menses. 2. Mammography a. Recommended frequency (ACS): Baseline exam between 35-40y. Every other year between ages 40-50. Annually afte r age 50. Only 25-35% of women are currently screened following the guidelines. Ultrasound more effective for women < 35y. b. Efficacy: 42% of breast cancers det ectable only by mammography. Regularly screened women have 30-40% less breast cancer mortality, and 25% fewer cases are advanced stage at diagnosis. False negative rate 10-15%. c. Technique: Breasts compressed. Radiat ion dose 0.1cGy. Cancers typically have irregular contour or calcifications of variable size or linear arrangement. V.

The axillary nodes are divided into 3 groups: Level I nodes are lateral to pectoralis minor muscle, Level II nodes are between lateral and m edial border of pectoralis minor (Rotter's nodes), and Level III nodes are medial to pec toralis minor including subclavicular, infraclavicular and apical nodes. Metastases to other nodes, including cervical, and contralateral internal mammary nodes are considered distant (M1). VI. Treatment Treatment for breast cancer is complex and rapi dly evolving.

Incidence: Second most common cancer of wom en, worldwide. 12th most common cancer of women and 3rd most common gyn malignancy in USA. 9,710 cases, and 3700 deaths in 2006 in USA (Jemal) II. Epidemiology: A. Falling incidence 1940 to1986. Rising since 1986 for Caucasian women B. Table of Relative Risks (Morrow, Wright in Hoskins) RR Age at coitarche (years) <16 7 6-10 vs>10 3 Sexual partners (# before age 20) >4 vs 0-1 4 Genital Warts 3 Smoker > .25 PPD, >20 years vs < 1 yr 4 HPV detectable on exam Varies by HPV type 4-40 OCP, long term use 1.5-2 Deficient carotene, vitamin C (Verreault) 2-3 Increased risk: lack of screening or screening interval too long (Hartmann , Shy), immunosuppression (HIV, pharmacologic), black, poor, hi-risk male (multiple sexual partners, uncircumcis ed with poor hygiene) Decreased risk: barrier contraceptives, religious social behavior C. Etiology: cervical cancer is a sexua lly transmitted disease (Wright in Hoskins) 1. Human Papillomavirus (HPV) DNA detectabl e > 95% of squamous cervical cancers, and many adenocarcinomas (30-40%). Types 16, 18, 31, 45 (and less common types 33, 35, 39, 51, 52, 54, 55, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68) more frequently associated with malignancy than 6, 11 more often seen with condyloma. Possible co-carcinogens: nicotine, herpes 2. HPV is circular, double-strand DNA virus of about 8kb with eight open reading frames, when in its infectious state and in condyloma. Viral DNA inserts into host genome when progression to malignant phenotype occurs. HPV E6 gene codes for a protein that degrades p53 and HPV E7 gene codes for a protein which complexes with pRB, thereby releasing transcription fa ctor E2F. The cell is immortalized. 3. Invasion is the endpoint of disease beginning as dysplasia, progressing through various stages of CIN. CIN-1 to CIN-3 is 7 years. Transit of CIN-3 to invasion ranges between 0 and 20 years. III. Pathology, with subtypes Prevalence HPV Associated Squamous Neuroendocrine uncommon unlikely Sarcoma/lymphoma/serous rare unlikely IV. Natural history Gyn Onc Overview , Page 7 R. Kevin Reynolds, MD Postmenopausal (46%), (9%), pain (6%). B. Spread via local invasion followed by lymphatic and vascular metastasis V. Screening: ACS / NCCN / ASCCP consensus (Saslow) A. When to Initiate Screening 1. Begin 3 years after coitarche or by age 21 2. Begin earlier if DES exposed, Hx of HPV or cervical CA, immunocompromised 3. Do not delay onset of gyn care if screening not yet needed B. When to discontinue screening 1. >70y with 3 consecutive negative Paps & no CIN for 10y 2. Hysterectomy without CIN2-3 or cancer as indication 3. Co-morbid or life threatening illness C. Screening interval 1. Initial interval a. Every 1y conventional or b. Every 2y liquid cytology. Higher s ensitivity than glass-slide method 2. At >30y age may increase to a. Every 2-3y if 3 consecutive, satisf actory, negative Paps and no high risk factors such as CA, DES or immunocompromised b. Every 3y using HPV test for hi risk types with either Pap method VI. Diagnosis of dysplasia and invasive carcinoma A. Speculum and bimanual exam with biopsy of visible lesions B. Cytology: false negative rate 20% for squamous CA, 40% for adeno CA C. Colposcopy with biopsy and ECC. 1. Flow Chart for Management of the Abnormal Pap Colposcopy with biopsy and ECC Unsatisfactory Satisfactory Biopsy = HSIL, or persistent LSIL Biopsy = invasion, Clinical staging Small lesion, and low grade Large lesion or high grade FIGO stage IA-1, Invades to 3 mm Any FIGO stage > IA-1 Fertility Desired See Invasive Observation LEEP or Cancer Flowchart only, unless Laser or Yes No persistent; or Cone biopsy treat sparingly Cone Biopsy Simple hysterectomy Gyn Onc Overview , Page 8 R. Kevin Reynolds, MD 2. Pap Triage and Indications for Colposcopy (ALTS trial, ASCCP consensus guidelines [Wright], and www.NCCN.org ) a. ASC-US: reflex HPV test if liquid- based pap done. If HPV positive for high-risk types, then do colposcopy. If HPV negative, resume annual pap b. HSIL, LSIL or ASC-H: colposcopy 3. Technique of colposcopy with directed biopsy and ECC. a. Stain with acetic acid (3-5%). mucosa. b. Inspect with colposcope, 15X obj ective; with and without green filter. c. Find squamocolumnar junction (SCJ). Th is defines \"satisfactory\" or \"adequate\" colposcopy. Most cervical cancers arise at the SCJ. d. Look for acetowhite epithelium and va scular patterns. Biopsy atypical areas. Always do ECC unless patient pregnant. e. Warning signs to safeguard against overlooking cancer i. Yellowish color, especially areas that are friable ii. Irregular contour (exophytic or ulcerative) iii. Atypical vessels iv. Extremely coarse mosaicism or punctation v. Large, complex, multiquadrant lesions 3. Colposcopy scoring system (Reid) Reid's scoring system to improve colposcopic accuracy: Score 0 1 2 Margin Exophytic condylomata; areas showing a micropapillary contour Lesions with distinct edges Feathered, scalloped edges Lesions with angular, jagged shape Satellite areas and acetowhite staining distal to the original SCJ Lesions with regular shape, showing smooth, straight edges Rolled, peeling edges Any internal demarcation between areas of differing colposcopic appearance Color Shiny, snow-white color Areas of faint, semitransparent whitening Intermediate shade (shiny, but gray-white) Dull reflectance with oyster- white color Vessels Fine caliber vessels, poorly formed patterns No surface vessels Definite, coarse punctation or mosaic Iodine Any lesion staining mahogany brown, or mustard yellow staining by a minor lesion Partial iodine staining, mottled pattern Mustard yellow staining of significant lesion (score of >3 by first three criteria) If Score 0-2: expect condyloma / CIN-I If Score 3-5: expect CIN-II If Score 6-8: expect CIN-III VII. Treatment of Cervical Dysplasia. Gui delines supported by ASCCP and NCCN. In general, \"treat lesions, not cytology\" A. Condyloma and CIN-I: 1. Observation with pap smears every 6 months x 2 2. If antecedent pap was HSIL, review cytology and consider LEEP or cone biopsy 3. If lesion regresses on both paps, resume annual pap 4. If lesion persists at one year or if high ri sk HPV types are present at one year, repeat colposcopy B. CIN II and CIN III 1. LEEP, or laser, or cryocautery or cone biopsy 2. Followup with pap every 6 mont hs x 2, then resume annual pap Gyn Onc Overview , Page 9 R. Kevin Reynolds, MD 3. Hysterectomy is acceptable if age, reproductive desire, and comorbidity are concordant C. cone biopsy. LEEP may not suffice given the difficulty in obtaining an intact endocervical canal specimen D. Management During Pregnancy 1. Speculum and bimanual exam with scr eening cytology. Biopsy visible lesions 2. If pap abnormal, then colposcopy with direct ed biopsy if HSIL or invasive carcinoma suspected. ECC contraindicated a. Pap low grade SIL, colposcopic appear ance concurs: pap q. 8-12 weeks and repeat colposcopy postpartum b. Pap high grade SIL, and/or colposcopi c appearance of high grade lesion: biopsy, then repeat colposcopy (\u00b1 biopsy) q. 6-8 postpartum c. Vaginal delivery indicated 3. Antepartum conization only for microinvasion on punch biopsy or for suspicion of invasion E. Treatment of vaginal dysplasia or condyloma 1. Krebs regimen. 5% Efudex cream, 1.5 gm (one quarter applicator) intravaginally once per week for 10 weeks. Use Desitin ointment on vulva, water douche morning after Rx. Minor skin irritati on common. Contraindicated during pregnancy. This is an Off Label use of the drug. 2. Laser photoablation. Require s an anesthetic, cost higher. 3. A few case reports support use of imiqui mod cream 5% (Aldara) for treatment of vaginal or vulvar dysplasia (Diakomanolis) VIII. General Principles of Laser Treatment for Pre-invasive Disease A. Clinical utility depends on use of appropriate wavelength. The CO 2 laser is most applicable to ablation of condyloma, dysplasi a, and carcinoma-in-situ. It is also well suited for laser conization. The 10,600 nm wave length is absorbed by water, resulting in tissue vaporization. Absorption occurs at the surface. Thermal damage to underlying tissue is minimized B. Power density must be adequate to prevent char PD (Watts/cm 2)=(Watts x 100)/ r2, r=spot radius (not diameter) C. A colposcope is used to guide the laser. Low power Helium Neon (HeNe) laser (red beam) is used for aiming. Eye protection mandatory IX. Laser Treatment for Cervical Pre-invasive Disease A. Technique 1. Transformation zone (T-zone) outlined using acetic acid and colposcope 2. Set power density to 750-1000 W/cm 2; 25-30 W with spot size of 2 mm 3. Anesthetize cervix with 1% Lidocaine with epinephrine (0.5 mL injections around circumference of portio) 4. Vaporize entire T-zone, one quadrant at a time, to a depth of 7 mm. This ablates gland crypts. If bleeding noted, defocus beam for hemostasis. Any char produced is removed immediately to prevent increased thermal injury 5. Apply Monsel's solution for hemostasis B. Advantages of Laser Treatment 1. Precise control of tissue ablation/excision 2. Minimal damage to adjacent normal tissue 3. SCJ remains at external os 4. More effective than cryotherapy for large lesions C. Disadvantages of Laser Treatment 1. Risk of bleeding 1-3%; risk of stenosis 1% Gyn Onc Overview , Page 10 R. Kevin Reynolds, MD 2. Expensive 3. More training required than for cryocautery 4. Small but real concern of air borne transmission of viral particles 5. Destruction of large portion of cervix possible X. General Principles of Electrosur gery for Cervical Pre-invasive Disease A. Radio frequency current (350 KHz-3.3 MHz) results in kinetic energy transfer to intracellular ions which vaporizes intracellu lar water. Avoid Faradic Effect (50 Hz-200 KHz), which stimulates muscle and nerve causing pain by using proper Procedure (LEEP) A. Technique 1. Transformation zone outlined using acetic acid and colposcope 2. Anesthetize with 1% Lidocaine with epinephrine 3. Choose loop to excise entire T-zone (1.5 cm x 7 mm, or 2.0 cm x 8 mm) 4. Excise tissue in single pass, using 40 W, blend mode (use insulated speculum) 5. Obtain ECC 6. Cauterize base with ball elec trode at 50 W, coagulation mode 7. Apply Monsel's solution B. Advantages 1. Diagnostic and therapeutic interventi on, potentially with one clinic visit 2. Histologic specimen improves diagnostic accuracy 3. SCJ remains at external os 4. Equipment less costly than laser C. Disadvantages 1. Risk of bleeding 1-3%; risk of stenosis 1% 2. Greater cost to pat ient than cryocautery 3. Small but real concern of air borne transmission of viral particles 4. Destruction of large portion of cervix possible XII. General Principles of Cryosurger y for Cervical Pre-invasive Disease A. Rapid cooling with NO 2 forms intracellular ice which ruptures cell membranes B. Freeze-thaw-freeze technique results in higher success rates than single freeze XIII. Cryocautery Procedure for Cervical Pre-invasive Disease A. Technique 1. Transformation zone outlined using acetic acid and colposcope 2. Select flat or dimpled cryo-probe ( not cone tip) and apply lubricant to tip 3. Freeze until ice ball extends 5 mm lateral to all sides of cryo-probe. Do not use time as a measure of adequacy of the freeze 4. Allow tissue to thaw until pink and pliable 5. Repeat step 3 B. Advantages 1. Inexpensive 2. Easy to learn C. Disadvantages 1. Risk of bleeding 1%; risk of stenosis 1% 2. Heavy vaginal discharge during healing XIV. Treatment Results for Cervical Pre-inva sive Disease. Successful elimination of CIN Treatment CIN 2 CIN 3 ( quadrants) CIN 3 , Page 11 R. Kevin Reynolds, MD A. If margin of LEEP or cone biopsy is invo lved with dysplasia, likelihood of successful eradication of CIN is 60%. Options incl ude surveillance versus repeat excision. XV. Followup for Cervical Pre-invasive Disease A. Repeat Pap smear (and colposcopy at discret ion of physician) every 6 months x 1 year B. Partner should be informed about HPV and role of \"safe sex\" 1. 70% will have lesions 2. Treatment of male has no proven effect on prevention of recurrence in the female XVI. Treatment Failures for Cervical Pre-invasive Disease A. Reinfection of epithelium with existi ng latent HPV virus (not B. Incomplete destruction of transformation zone ( preventable ) C. Missed diagnosis of invasive lesion ( preventable ) D. Prevention of treatment failures Risk of preventable treatment failure minimized by use of triage rules: Never ablate (cryocautery or laser) a cervical lesion unless: 1. All of the transformation zone is visible, and 2. Biopsies and Pap smears are consistent, and 3. Endocervical curettage is negative, and 4. There is no colposcopic or cytologic suspicion of invasion Otherwise, excise for diagnosis (LEEP or cone biopsy) XVII. Cervical Cancer Stage: determined by clinical examination. FIGO Staging for Cervix, Revised 1995 0 Carcinoma in situ I Carcinoma confined to the cervix (Disregard extension to corpus) I a 1 Measurable invasion 3 mm in depth and 7 mm in diameter I a 2 Measurable invasion > 3 and 5 mm in depth and 7 mm in diameter I b 1 Lesion of > 5 mm depth and/or >7mm diameter, but 4 cm in diameter I b 2 Lesion of > 4 cm diameter I I Tumor extends beyond the cervix but not to the pelvic wall. Tumor may involve vagina, but not the lower 1/3 I I a No parametrial involvement I I b Parametrial involvement I I I Tumor extends to the pelvic wall, or may involve the lower 1/3 of vagina. I I I a No extension to pelvic wall I I I b Extension to pelvic wall. Includes hydronephrosis or non-functioning kidney IV Spread beyond the true pelvis or involv ement of bladder or rectal mucosa IV a Spread to adjacent organs IV b Spread to distant organs A. Tests which may be used to stage include bi opsy, colposcopy, IVP, CXR, cystoscopy, and sigmoidoscopy. Tests which may not be used to stage include surgery, CT or MRI scans, and lymphangiograms. All tests may be used for treatment planning B. Cystoscopy and sigmoidoscopy usually indica ted only in stage IIB, III, IV or if symptoms such as hematuria or narrowed fecal stream exist (Shingleton) XVIII. Management of invasive cervical carcinoma A. Microinvasion: a subset of early cancer s with minimal risk of local or node metastases. See Flow Chart VI.C.1 (above) for diagnosis and clinical management 1. Rationale for conservative treatment to preserve fertility SGO (FIGO IA-1) FIGO IA-2 Histology NO VSI node mets < 1% 8% Gyn Onc Overview , Page 12 R. Kevin Reynolds, MD 2. Adenocarcinoma is not substaged into a microinvasive categor y although literature supports conservative treatment in selected cases (Schorge ) B. Flow Chart for Management of Invasive (> Stage IA-1) Cervical Cancer. For microinvasive cervical cancer, see VI.C.1. (above) for flowchart. Clinical staging with bimanual and scan of abdomen and pelvis and pelvis, hysterectomy upper vaginectomy, pelvic lymphadenectomy and possible ovarian preservation; or External pelvic radiation therapy with chemosensitization and either: Fletcher- Suite External pelvic radiation therapy with interstitial template, chemo- sensitization, and possible para-aortic RT. For select IA-2 and lymph- adenectomy, cerclage brachytherapy (low dose rate) or high brachytherapy applications Chance of fistula fairly high: palliative urinary diversion or colostomy occasionally necessary C. Conventional radical hysterectomy is via the laparotomy approach. Newer techniques include laparoscopic radical hysterecto my, laparoscopic trachelectomy (Dargent, Plante, Reynolds) D. Chemosensitization has been shown to significantly improve outcome in 5 randomized trials. Most common regimen is cisplatin 40 mg/meter2/week (maximum dose of 70 mg/week) during RT. Other regimens in clude cisplatin and 5-FU. (Rose, Keys) E. Comparison of Surgery vs Radi ation (for Stage Ib/IIa tumors) Surgery Radiation Survival and fistulae 1.4-5.3% function Initially shortened, lengthens with intercourse or Fibrosis and stenosis, especially in postmenopause. bladder 3% Radiation enteritis 6-8% F. Special Cases 1. Pregnancy a. Stage for stage, pregnancy does not worsen survival. Delayed diagnosis is common Gyn Onc Overview , Page 13 R. Kevin Reynolds, MD b. Timing of treatment controversial. Classical approach is to terminate pregnancy if gestation 24 weeks at diagnosis. If >24 weeks, delay therapy until fetal viability. Newer studies suggest no decrease in survival with longer treatment delays (Takushi) c. Cesarean delivery usually recommended for invasive lesions due to friability of tumor. Vaginal delivery does not worsen prognosis but tumor implants in episiotomy sites have been reported 2. Occult carcinoma: tumor not diagnosed prior to surgery a. Treatment options include pelvic radiation, radical parametrectomy b. If appropriate treatment not done, recurrence rate >75% c. Prognosis is poor if gross tumor is cut through on margins of hysterectomy 3. Barrel shaped cervix: intact cervix of 4-6 cm diameter (Keys, Maruyama, Paley) a. High rate of central pelvic failure (25-40%) after RT b. Some advocate combined RT followed by extrafascial TAH. Reported pelvic recurrence drops from 19% to 2%, and extrapelvic recurrences from 16% to 7%. 4. Positive lymph vascular space involvem ent, positive nodes or extracervical spread detected during or after completion of radical hysterectomy (Peters) a. If node or parametrial involvement is documented, then pelvic radiation therapy with cisplatin chemosensitization is given. If VSI positive, consider RT + chemo b. If para-aortic nodes involved, consider scalene node biopsy and offer extended field radiation, if scalene nodes negative 5. Central pelvic recurrence a. Patient with prior radical hysterectomy: radiation therapy to pelvis with chemosensitization. b. Patient with prior pelvic radiation with or without prior radical hysterectomy: total pelvic exenteration. Contraindicated wit h lymphatic metastases, extension of disease to pelvic sidewall or distant ma tastasis. Removes bladder, uterus, vagina and rectum. Requires extensive recons truction including urinary conduit or low rect al anastamosis or end colostomy, and vaginoplasty with split thickness skin graft or myocutaneous flap. Salvage rate 60-70%, mortality rate 2% c. In special circumstances, patients with recurrent disease extending to the pelvic sidewall may benefit from the latera lly extended endopelvic resection procedure or to the (H\u00f6ckel) 6. Distant metastatic disease cannot be considered curable with chemotherapy. Progression free intervals are in the 9-15 month range. Regimens include: a. (uroprotector), 20% of ifosfamide dose given IV 15 minutes before, 4 and 8 hours after each dose. MESNA can be given 2 and 6 hours after if osfamide at 40% of ifosfamide dose. Response rate 33% c. Other single reported be for tumor in non-irradiated sites, 18% response rate for tumor in previ ously radiated sites. Other reported combinations include cisplatin (50 mg/m 2 on day 1) with topotecan (0.75 mg/m 2/day on days 1-3); OR paclitaxel (135 mg/m 2 over 24 hours on day 1) with cisplatin (50 mg/m 2 on day 2) e. Cisplatin and 5-FU, similar respons e rates to cisplatin and ifosfamide. f. Participation in clinical trials is strongly encouraged Gyn Onc Overview , Page 14 R. Kevin Reynolds, MD XIX.

Treatment based on initia l clinical presentation A. If medically operable, clinical stage I: to tal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo- oophorectomy (TH/BSO), para-aor tic lymphadenectomy, peritoneal cytology 1. Abdominal hysterectomy has historic ally been the standard approach for treatment of endometrial cancer 2. Laparoscopic hysterectomy a. A number of studies have shown simila r staging efficacy and complication rates for laparoscopic vs. abdominal approach (review by Kueck). b. Small prospective randomized trials show equivalent survival outcome (review by Kueck). c. Definitive, large, randomized trial ( GOG LAP-2) has not yet reported survival outcomes comparing laparoscopy vs laparotomy 3. Role of lymphadenectomy a. Surgery without will metastatic disease in 29% (Ben- Shachar, Yenen) and upstaging or upgrading occurs in 67% of fully staged patients compared to those in whom fr ozen section is relied upon to determine need for staging (Frumovitz) b. Therapeutic value of lymphadenectomy is debated, with a number of studies suggesting survival benefit (Chan, Cragun, Creutzberg, Kilgore, Trimble) and a number of studies showing no benefit (Ceccaroni, Kitchener, Vizza). There have been no sizable, prospective, randomized trials to date. 4. Panniculectomy: may improve exposure for the obese patient. Shown to increase number of nodes recovered and ability to complete surgical staging (Wright) B. If poor candidate for complete staging proc edure, clinical Stage I, Grade 1-2: vaginal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy C. In young patients desiring to retain fertility with clinical stage I grade 1 disease: treat with curettage followed by progestin therapy (megestrol acetate 80 mg po bid for 3 months) followed by repeat biopsy or curettage. Small series show excellent outcomes, but careful informed consent necessary for non-standard therapy (Farhi) D. If medically inoperable: pelvic radiation therapy with brachyther apy application(s) E.

Prognostic significance debated with some studies showing no impact on survival (Grimshaw, Kasamatsu) and some s howing poor outcome (Creasman) b. or uterine serosal involv ement: treated with chemotherapy +/- tumor directed RT (NCCN) 2. Stage IIIB: tumor directed RT +/- chemotherapy 3. Stage IIIC: chemotherapy better (50% vs. 38% disease free survival at 5 years) based on randomized trial comparing whole abdominal RT vs. cisplatin and doxorubicin chemotherapy (Randall) 4. Treatment individualized. May incl ude surgery, and/or tumor directed RT D. Stage IV: Treatment individualized. 1. Chemotherapy a. Cisplatin 50 mg/m2 day 1, doxorubicin 45 mg/m2 day 1 and paclitaxel 165 mg/m2 day 2 with cytokine support days 3-12 r epeated every 3 weeks. Regimen has highest response rates 57% vs. 34% for cisplatin 50 mg/m2 and doxorubicin 60 mg/m2. Average progression free survival is 5 to 8 months (Fleming) b. Doxorubicin (Adriamycin), 60-75 mg/m 2 IV q3weeks (maximum cumulative dose 450 mg/m 2), is the most active single-agent drug. Response rate is 37% 2. Tumor directed RT may be useful to palliate bleeding or pain. Gyn Onc Overview , Page 21 R. Kevin Reynolds, MD 3. For estrogen-progesterone receptor positive tumors, or metastatic grade 1-2 tumors, hormonal therapy with megestrol acetate, 80 mg po bid and / or tamoxifen 10-20 mg po bid, sometimes useful E. There is no demonstrated benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy or hormonal therapy (Morrow) F. Uterine papillary serous tumors (UPST) 1. Clinical stage underestimates extent of disease in 50%. 2. Patients with surgical stage I recur in 50-60%. Recur in upper abdomen 67%. Natural history resembles ovarian tumors. 3. Adjuvant therapy using combination chemotherapy with or without pelvic RT favored in phase II trials. No sizable phase III studies available. Best regimens reported include carboplatin and paclitaxel alone (Dietrich) or in combination with RT (Bancher-Todesca, Kelly, Turner) G. Incompletely staged disease. If uterine dis ease is myoinvasive or grade is 2-3, then either complete staging surgically or image and base adjuvant therapy on best assessment of disease extent. X. Survival A.

Role of pelvic lymphadenectomy in the management of stage I endometrial cancer: Pelvic-paraaortic lymphadenectomy in clinical Stage I Gyn Onc Overview Reynolds, MD Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia I. Trophoblastic neoplasms are essentially tumors of the placenta. The disease can be divided into a non-invasive group of tumors consisting of complete and partial moles, and an invasive group of tumors including invasive mole, choriocarcinoma and placental site trophoblastic tumor. II. Incidence of hydatidiform molar pregnancies (Non-invasive disease) A. Population based studies 1:522 (Japan) to 1:1560 (Sweden) B. Hospital based studies 1:85 (Indonesia) to 1:1724 (USA) C. In elective abortions in US 1:600 and 1:1500 pregnancies in US III. Epidemiology of hydatidiform moles Table of Relative Risks RR Prior Molar Pregnancy 10-40 Maternal age <20 1.5 Maternal age >40 5.2 Prior Spontaneous Abortion 1.9-3.3 Vitamin A, above median 0.6 Parity >1 0.4 IV. Pathology of hydatidiform moles A. Complete: Arise from fertilization of an empty oocyte with 1 sperm that is then duplicated (more common) or 2 sperm (less common) B. Partial: Arises from fertilization of an apparently normal oocyte with 2 sperm Characteristic Complete Mole Partial 46 paternal chromosomes Fetus Absent Often present Villous edema Prominent and diffuse Focal if at all Fetal RBC None Usually present Proliferation of trophoblast Prominent Mild to moderate Likelihood of local invasion 15% 3.5% Likelihood of metastasis 4% 0.6% V. Clinical Features A. Presenting Symptoms of Moles Complete Partial Vaginal Bleeding 97% If size of uterus is > 16 weeks 27% B. Diagnosis of hydatidiform moles 1. Usually diagnosed in first trimester. Wo rkup often initiated because of symptoms (Section V.A.) 2. Ultrasound: a. Complete mole: vesicula r pattern, \"snowstorm pattern\" Gyn Onc Overview , Page 25 R. Kevin Reynolds, MD b. Partial mole: focal cystic change in placenta and ratio of transverse to AP dimension of gestational sac of > 1.5. A small for dates fetus with multiple anomalies may be present 3. -hCG elevated, especially in complete moles. 46% of complete moles have -hCG > 100,000 mU/mL. 6% of partial moles have -hCG > 100,000 mU/mL. Partial moles may have higher percentage of -hCG. VI. moles -hCG; renal and thyroid function tests; blood type with Rh and antibody screen; chest X-ray B. Curettage, suction and sharp, using oxytocin. Do not begin oxytocin until uterus evacuated to minimize intra-uterine t one and trophoblastic emboli. Hysterectomy acceptable, if fertility no longer desired C. Post-treatment follow-up: Follow -hCG every week until normal for 3 weeks, then monthly for 6 months. Contraception to prevent confusion over interpretation of -hCG values is important. OCPs do not increas e the likelihood of persistent disease. D. If -hCG levels plateau x3 weeks or rise x2 weeks, then metastatic workup and chemotherapy is initiated. Repeat curettage occasionally useful. E. Management Flow Diagram Suction curettage, weekly -hCG -hCG: normal regression -hCG: plateau or rise Observation x 6 months with contraception Metastatic workup Assess risk and FIGO stage Low risk High risk Single agent chemo with Methotrexate / FA. Keep Actinomycin-D in reserve See treatment plans for stage and histologic type Treat 1-3 cycles after -hCG negative. Follow -hCG x1y F. Two randomized trials show that high risk moles may be treated with prophylactic chemotherapy. High risk defined as -hCG >100,000 mU/mL, uterine size > dates and ovary(s) > 6 cm. Results in reduced risk of post-molar invasion (47 vs. 14%). If persistence occurs, more cycles of chemo needed. Deaths have been reported with prophylactic chemo using methotrexate and folinic acid or dactinomycin regimens. G. Choriocarcinoma can arise from a normal pregnancy (1 : 22,000-100,000 pregnancies). Mother is at increased risk of medical complications of pregnancy. Karyotype of Gyn Onc Overview , Page 26 R. Kevin Reynolds, MD pregnancy may be required to confirm diagnosis . Genetics different than other GTN. Worse prognosis. H. Phantom hCG (false positive) can confus e diagnosis. Usually seen with low hCG levels. Caused by heterophilic antibodies in circulat ion. Should be suspected if clinical response to methotrexate does not occur. Should be ruled out before doing hysterectomy or multi-agent chemotherapy. Can be tested for by urine pregnancy test (negative) with positive blood test, or by doing serial dilution tests. VII. Incidence of invasive gesta tional trophoblastic disease (GTD) A. Invasive mplete moles and 3.5% of partial moles Metastases occur 4% of complete moles and 0.6% of moles occurs following 3-7% of hydatidiform moles and 1:40,000 term pregnancies. Of all choriocarcinoma cases, 50% preceded by mole, 25% by SAb, 25% by term pregnancy D. Placental Site Trophoblast Tumor (PSTT) is a rare variant of GTD (55 cases by 1991) VIII. Pathology of GTD invading myometrium or other tissues. Necrosis and hemorrhage common C. PSTT comprised of intermediate cytotrophoblasts D. Tumor marker: -hCG useful for all types except PSTT (hPL may be elevated in PSTT) E. (20%), (10%), or kidney or spleen (<5%). IX. Evaluation for metastatic disease A Metastatic workup: 1. Initial Labs: CBC; -hCG; liver, thyroid, renal function tests; chest X-ray 2. If chest X-ray positive or if choriocarcinoma is present or if vaginal mets present, then: CT of head, chest, abdomen and pelvis 3. Lumbar puncture for -hCG if CXR positive, CT negative. Serum/CSF -hCG ratio <60 indicates CNS disease. 4. Pelvic ultrasound with or without Doppler ma y be helpful to detect sites of persistent intra-uterine disease. 5. Avoid biopsy of vaginal lesions due to tendency to hemorrhage Anatomic Staging for Gestat ional Trophoblastic Neoplasia (GTN) Stage I Disease confined to the uterus Stage II GTN extends outside of uterus, but is limited to genital structures including adnexa, vagina, broad ligament Stage III GTN extends to lungs with or without genital tract involvement Stage IV All other metastatic sites C. Current staging combines anatomic st aging with the modified WHO prognostic scoring system. For stage I disease, risk is usually low. For stage IV disease, risk is usually high. Stage II and III disease is best stratifi ed with the modified WHO prognostic scoring system D. Stage is recorded as Anatomic Stage and FIGO modified WHO score, separated by colon. Example of format.

Treatment of Invasive or Metastatic GTD A. Stage I, Low Risk 1. Fertility desired: Treat with single agent chemo. 87% will be complete responders (CR) with a single regimen. If a second single agent regimen is needed for persistent disease, the CR increases to 92%. Rarely, resistance may require hyst or multiagent chemotherapy regimens (EMA/CO). Result s in CR of 100% remissions (2 reported failures in literature). First line regimen is methotrexate with folinic acid. Treatment conversion to dactinomycin is made if resi stance or dose-limiting toxicity occurs. a. Methotrexate (1.0 mg/kg IM days 1,3,5,7) and Leucovorin (0.1 mg/kg IM days 2,4,6,8). Repeated every 2 weeks. b. Dactinomycin (1.25 mg/m 2 IV, Q14 days) c. Other dose schedules for both drugs are published (Rubin) d. 5 fluorouracil is widely used for treat ment of GTN in other countries, with excellent results 2. Fertility not desired: hysterectomy and adjuvant single agent chemotherapy as above. 3. Treatment continues until the -hCG is negative. Surveillance includes weekly -hCG during treatment, then -hCG every 2 weeks x 3, then monthly -hCG for 12 months after completion of therapy. B. Stages II and III, High Risk 1. Multi agent chemotherapy with EM A/CO is the preferred regimen a. Etoposide 100 mg/m 2 IV on day 1 and 2, dactinomycin (Actinomycin-D) 0.5 mg IV on day 1 and 2, methotrexate 100 mg/m 2 IV push on day 1 then 200 mg/m 2 IV over 12 hours on day 1 (alkalinize urine). Leucovorin 15 mg IM or PO q 6 hours x 4 doses beginning 12 hours after methotrexate is completed. b. Cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m 2 IV on day 8, vincristine 1 mg/m 2 on day 8 c. Repeat cycle every 2 weeks d. If resistance occurs, cisplatin 80 mg/m 2 IV on day 8 and etoposide 100 mg/m 2 IV on day 8 is administered in the EMA/ EP regimen as a replacement of the cyclophosphamide and vincristine portion of the EMA/CO regimen. The EMA portion of the regimen is unchanged. e. If brain metastasis is present, high dose EMA/CO is used. EMA/CO doses are the same as above except the methotrexate dose: 1000 mg/m 2 by 24 hour infusion on day 1 (alkalinize urine), Leucovorin 15 mg IV, IM or PO q 8 hours x 9 doses after MTX infused. May also need to add intrathecal methotrexate 12.5 mg every 2 weeks. Gyn Onc Overview , Page 28 R. Kevin Reynolds, MD 2. Treatment continues for three full cycles after the -hCG becomes negative. Surveillance includes weekly -hCG during treatment, then -hCG every 2 weeks x 3, then monthly -hCG for 24 months after completion of therapy. C. Stage IV, High Risk 1. Treatment is urgent and includes EMA/CO, selective surgery and selective radiation therapy depending on the sites of metastases. Liver lesions may hemorrhage and resection is occasionally needed. 2. Brain metastasis is usually symptomatic and is considered an oncologic emergency. Treatment is either with r adiation therapy (30 Gy in 10 fractions) or intrathecal methotrexate or high dose EMA/CO (see section X.B.1.e, above). D. If resistant disease develops, diagnosis may be aided by PET scan, angiography, or radiolabelled antibody to -hCG. Surgical resection of resist ant foci of disease in uterus, lung, brain, or liver may improve prognosis E. Placental site trophoblastic tumor (PS TT) is refractory to chemotherapy. When identified, surgical treatment incl uding hysterectomy is indicated. XI. Survival CNS RT 68% Note that low risk disease includes lung metastases. XII. Fertility is essentially unchanged once the disease has been cleared. References ACOG Practice Bulletin.

Genetic counseling should be recommended and gene testing offered. b. High risk individuals may benefit from chemoprevention with OCP (literature with c onflicting studies) c. For BRCA mutation carriers, prophylactic oophorectomy results in 85-96% ovarian cancer risk reduction and 53-68% breast cancer risk reduction (Lalley: Kauff, Reebeck) PMS1, PMS2.

Precocious pseudopuberty and virilization seen with some germ cell and sex cord/stromal tumors III. Diagnosis and Screening for Ovarian Mass A. Obtain family history and initiate genetic counseling and gene testing for high risk individual. (See Section II.D.2.a-e.) B. Regular pelvic exams per ACOG recommendation. C. Ultrasound for screening controversial due to co st and sensitivity/specificity (DePriest). When used to triage a known mass 75-100% sensitive, 83-95% specific (Sassone, Kawai, Kurjak) D. Tumor Markers. Sensitivity and specificit y too low for screening. CA-125 has 55% false negative rate for stage I epithelial ovarian c ancer. See Pathology Section (VII.A-D.) for markers associated with each tumor type. New markers such as Ovacheck (proteomics- based chip) and LPA are in development. E.

Tumor marker(s) appropriate for patient's age B. Ultrasound helpful for triage of clinically palpable cystic masses C. Chest X-ray abnormal in 9% of new cases, to rule out metastases or effusions D. Liver function tests, important if ascite s present to rule out primary liver disease E. Barium enema or colonoscopy abnormal in 39% of new cases with large or fixed masses. Order if > 45 years ol d or if GI symptoms present F. Abdominal and pelvic CT scan useful for some new cases with large or fixed masses. Not necessary for all new cases Gyn Onc Overview , Page 31 R. Kevin Reynolds, MD G. Intravenous pyelogram abnormal in 45% of new cases. CT scan more useful particularly if large or fixed mass present H. Head CT or abd/pelvic MRI; liver, spleen, and bone scans NOT routinely indicated I. Patients with suspicious adnexal masse s should be prepared for definitive staging procedure 1. Preoperative consultation with or referral to gynecologic oncologist 2. Consent for primary st aging and cytoreductive surgery 3. Mechanical bowel preparation 4. Pre-operative antibiotics 5. Thromboembolic prophylaxis with SCDs and or fractionated heparin 6. Appropriate positi oning of the patient a. Low lithotomy for patients with cul de sac masses b. Supine for all others 7. Appropriate incision a. Vertical incision preferred if malignancy is likely b. Maylard incision is acceptable alternative c. Pfannenstiel incision not desirable for high risk cases. Can be converted to Cherney incision for improved upper abdominal exposure d. Laparoscopic approach requires careful triage (Reynolds) J.

Kevin Reynolds, MD V. Surgical Procedures for Ovarian Cancer A. Initial surgical procedure for diagnosis and staging: 1. Objective is to define stage and to remo ve as much of the tumor as possible. 2. Staging requires biopsy or removal of affected ovary, pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes, omentum, peritoneal biopsies (pelvic sidewall, cul bladder serosa, pericolic gutters, and diaphragm), intraperitoneal cytology, and any suspicious lesions. 3. Debulking removes macroscopic disease. Residual disease is described in terms of diameter of largest remaining nodul es and percentage of tumor removed. 4. Techniques and procedures for debulking include. Aggressiveness of resection depends on the likelihood of attaining opt imal debulking. If a patient has non- resectable disease, radicality of debulking will be decreased to minimize morbidity. a. TAH-BSO b. Modified posterior exenteration c. Small or large intestinal resection d. Splenectomy e. Peritoneal stripping f. Ablation or resection of surface lesi ons with CUSA, LEEP, laser or excision g. Resection of portions of affected organs such as ureter, liver, and stomach B. Interval cytoreductive surgery 1. Debulking surgery following neoadjuvant (\"induction\") chemotherapy for patients who could not have an optimal primary cyt oreductive surgery due to extent of disease 2. Significant survival benefit demonstrated in one prospective randomized clinical trial (van der Burg) C. Second look surgery 1. Surgical reassessment for patients with complete response after primary surgery and chemotherapy 2. May be used as part of treatment protoc ols with informed consent but should not be used as routine clinical practice D. Secondary cytoreductive surgery 1. Debulking surgery for patients with persistent disease after completion of planned therapy or with recurrent diseas e after a period of remission. 2. Best candidates for this surgery have localized recurrences. 3. Predictors of successful secondary cytoreduction include relapse 12 months or longer from completion of therapy, tumors that were responsive to primary chemotherapy, high performance status, and pot ential for complete resection based on preoperative evaluation (Eisenhauer) 4. Patients able to be debulked to microscopic residual disease have 51% survival at 5 years compared to 10% survival at 5 years if any residual disease remained. (Hoskins) E. Palliative secondary surgery 1. Surgery to relieve symptoms associated with progression of ovarian carcinoma such as bowel obstruction. 2. Palliative surgery is kept to a minimum and is offered to patients likely to receive symptomatic relief 3. Selection of patients likely to benefit from palliative surgery for bowel obstruction associated with progression of ovarian c ancer can be objectively scored (Krebs) a. If score < 6, 84% chance of palliative benefit from surgery resulting in survival of at least 8 weeks. b. If score > 6, 20% chance of palliative benefit from surgery resulting in survival of at least 8 weeks. Gyn Onc Overview , Page 33 R. Kevin Reynolds, MD c. Scoring system Parameter Risk Score Age (years) < 45 45-65 >65 0 1 1 Nutritional Deprivation None or minimal Moderate Severe 0 1 2 Tumor Status No palpable intraabdominal masses Palpable intraabdominal masses Liver involvement or distant mets 0 1 2 Ascites None or mild (asymptomatic, no distension) Moderate (abdominal distension) Severe (requiring frequent paracentesis) 0 1 2 Previous chemotherapy None or no adequate trial Failed single drug therapy Failed combination therapy 0 1 2 Previous radiation therapy None Pelvic radiotherapy Whole abdominal radiotherapy 0 1 2 F. Prophylactic oophorectomy (Berchuck, NIH consensus) 1. Candidates for prophylactic oophorecto my should have documented hereditary ovarian cancer pedigree (ovarian site spec ific, breast-ovary, or hereditary non- MLH-1, PMS-1, PMS-2) 2. Ovaries removed after age 35 or completion of childbearing 3. Primary peritoneal carcinoma can occur in women who have undergone prophylactic oophorectomy in 2-10% of cases but risk of dying from ovarian cancer drops from RR 24 to RR13 in the surgically treated group G. Management of the pelvic mass in pregnancy (Carney) 1. Surgical intervention usually deferred until second trimester, if possible, in order to minimize anesthetic risks to developing embryo. 2. Staging may be abbreviated due to subopt imal exposure secondary to uterine enlargement 3. If tumor is of advanced stage or high gr ade, chemotherapy during pregnancy may be needed. Literature supports use of c hemotherapy but data on effects upon pregnancy are scant. Treatment for lower risk disease deferred until postpartum. H. Surgical pitfalls. Ovarian cancer outcome may be hampered by poor surgical technique, inadequate or incomplete staging, and absence of aggressive debulking. Adequacy of staging and survival is improved when treatment is performed by a gynecologic oncology specialist (Gershenson, Carney, Elit, McGowan) I. Surgical controversies 1. Rupture of ovarian cyst during surgery does not worsen prognosis (Sevelda) 2. Delay of definitive surgery after initial diagnosis worsens prognosis (Lehner) 3. Role of restaging after incomplete staging procedures (Soper) 4. Role of laparoscopic surgery (Maiman, Reynolds) 5. Attaining optimal debulking is the result of: a. Favorable tumor biology (Covens) b. Surgical expertise (Eisenkop) Gyn Onc Overview , Page 34 R. Kevin Reynolds, MD VI.

ICON 2: demonstrated that carboplatin alone was equally efficacious to cisplatin, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. ICON 3 re confirmed this finding when single agent carboplatin was compared to car boplatin and paclitaxel. ICON 4 shows weak, but statistically significant benefit to the combination of carboplatin with paclitaxel. b. GOG #111: cisplatin with either cycl ophosphamide or paclitaxel showed that paclitaxel-containing treatment arm had higher complete response (51 vs. 31%), higher overall response (73 vs. 60%), longer PFI (18 vs. 13 months), and longer median survival (38 vs. 24 months). (McGuire) Gyn Onc Overview , Page 38 R. Kevin Rey nolds, MD c. GOG #158: paclitax el with either cisplati n or carboplatin was equally efficacious. Carboplatin arm had lower neurotoxicit y and more severe thrombocytopenia. (Ozols) d. Dose intensity trial tested single- agent carboplatin at escalating doses. Effectiveness was equivalent for all doses above AUC 4 using the Calvert formula. (Jakobsen) e. Intraperitoneal versus intravenous therapy shows survival and progression-free interval advantages with IP therapy in 3 of 5 randomized trials (Markman). GOG # 172 randomized IV paclitaxel (135 mg/m2 over 24 hours) and IV cisplatin (75 mg/m2) q 21 days for 6 cycles versus IV paclitaxel (135 mg/m2 over 24 hours on day 1), IP cisplatin (100mg/m2 on day 2), and IP paclitaxel (60 mg/m2 on day 8) q 21 days for 6 cycles. Median progression-free survival was 18.3 and 23.8 months, and overall survival was 49.7 versus 65.6 months, respectively. Only 42% of patients could complete the IP therapy largely due to catheter complications. Quality of life was signific antly worse in the IP group during and shortly after Tx but not at 1 year. Grade 3- 4 toxicity was higher in the IP group by the following ratios: GI (2x), renal (3.5x), infection (2.5x), fatigue (4x), pain (7x), and metabolic events (3.5x) (Armstrong) 5.

Incidence: 1-2% of all gyn cancers. II. Epidemiology and Natural History: Etiology and cell types stratified by patient age A. Childhood tumors 1. Sarcoma botryoides: embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. 90% occur prot and Hematogenous mets occur as well. 2. Endodermal sinus tumor: germ cell origin (s ee ovary chapter). Occurs in infants. Can be mistaken for sarcoma botryoides. B. Tumors of adolescence and young adulthood: Clear cell carcinoma (CCC) associated with in-utero diethylstilbestrol ( DES) exposure. 1. Features of in-utero DES exposure: Risk of CCC (Vagina >> cervix) is 1:1000. History of in-utero DES exposure present in 67% of vaginal CCC, 33% of cervical CCC. Mean age of DES associated CCC 19y (range 7-42). Three histologic subtypes: (88% vs 73% 5y survival) and usually occurs after age 19. Adenosis present in 33%. Squamous metaplasia in adenosis makes colposcopic evaluation of dysplasia difficult, but causes eventual regressi on of adenosis. Lifetime risk of vaginal dysplasia increased. Probably no significant increased risk of breast cancer (controversial). DES associated uteri ne anomalies (80%) and infertility widely reported. 2. Recommended routine DES exam: Initial colposcopy, pap smear, and palpation of vagina. Take separate pap from vagina and cervix. If adenosis present, re-examine q6 months with colposcopy at least every 4th visit. C. Tumors of adults 1. Squamous carcinoma: Mean age 60-65y. Most common in upper 1/3 of vagina, and on posterior wall. Lymphatic drainage mimics cervix for upper vaginal lesions, and vulva for lower vaginal lesions. Frequently associated with HPV (usually HPV 16, see cervix chapter). 2. Malignant melanoma: Average age 55y (r ange 22-83). Usually in lower 1/3 of vagina, and on anterior wall. Pigm ented in 95%, amelanotic (Wolffian system) and M\u00fcllerian located anterolaterally, and anteriorly, respectively. Lymphoma and sarcoma (adult type) also occur rarely. D. Presenting symptoms: vaginal bleeding and foul discharge in 50-70% III. Pathology Squamous Carcinoma 80% Adenocarcinoma 14% Melanoma/Sarcoma 6% Germ Cell Tumors Rare IV. Diagnosis A. Biopsy and pelvic exam. Must rule out cervical, vulvar, and rectal lesions. By convention, tumor extension to cervix or vulv a reclassifies tumor as cervical or vulvar. B. Cystoscopy for anterior lesions C. Sigmoidoscopy for posterior lesions D. CXR and IVP, or CT abdomen and pelvis E. Gyn Onc Overview , Page 48 R. Kevin Reynolds, MD V. Staging FIGO Staging for Vaginal Cancer is determined by clinical examination I Limited to vaginal wall I I Involvement of subvaginal tissue I I I Extension to pelvic wall IV Spread beyond the true pelvis or involv ement of bladder or rectal mucosa IVa Spread to adjacent organs IVb Spread to distant organs Melanoma is staged using Breslow's system (see vulva chapter). VI. Treatment A. Carcinoma 1. Radiation therapy. Four field pelvic port (40-50 Gy) followed by interstitial implant (25-40 Gy to tumor volume). If lower 1/ 3 of vagina involved, inguinal nodes also treated. Patients with large or high stage lesions may benefit from addition of radiation sensitizers (cisplatin and/or 5-fluorouracil). Small stage I lesions can be treated with brachytherapy alone. 2. Surgery. Upper vaginal lesions treated wit h radical hysterectomy and vaginectomy. Better suited for superficial, posterior fornix lesions, or for patients who cannot be radiated. Recurrent tumors (after radiati on) may be treatable by pelvic exenteration. 3. DES-associated CCC in young women. Tr eatment customized to include resection +/- radiation therapy. Possible to preserve fertility in some cases. B. Melanoma. No standard therapy. Treatment includes exci sion +/- radiation therapy, radical surgery, and radiation therapy alone. Local excisions recur locally 80%. Radical excision impacts little on individualiz l. Surgical resection \u00b1 radiation is suggested for the tumor site and positive margins, respectively. Local control with chemotherapy alone is 15%. VII. Survival A. Carcinoma Stage Percent in Stage 5y Survival I 17 77% II 25 45% III 40 31% IV 18 18% Melanoma, all 15-20% 75% at 5y Gyn Onc Overview , Page 49 R. Kevin Reynolds, MD Vulvar Cancer I.

Punch biopsy technique: use Keys punch or Kevorkian forceps with local No suture required. Apply silver nitrate or Mons el's solution for hemostasis (Reid). Excision of small lesion: make elliptical incision fo llowing lines of tension in skin. Incise, undermine and remove lesion with minimal margin, if benign in appearance. Undermine surrounding skin to mobilize for closure. Use ma ttress or subcuticular stitch with fine absorbable suture (Jenison, Karlen). Gyn Onc Overview , Page 51 R. Kevin Reynolds, MD D. Shave biopsy technique contraindicated for possible melanoma lesions E. Colposcopy of the Vulva 1. Indications a. Persistent condyloma or visible lesion b. Chronic pruritus or pain 2. Colposcopy technique a. Soak vulva with gauze moistened with acet ic acid. Let soak for several minutes b. Inspect methodically c. Lesions may appear white, red, or pi gmented. Mosaic and punctation uncommon d. Biopsy anything which does not appear normal VI. Treatment of Pre-Invasive Disease A. Condyloma 1. TCA ( 85%): apply topically 1-3x per week. Safe during pregnancy 2. Laser (CO 2): requires anesthesia. See technique below. 3. LEEP: requires local anesthetic. Best method for debulking large condylomata. 4. Imiquimod (Aldara): apply to skin 3 times per week for up to 16 weeks. Apply at h.s. and leave on 6-10 hours, then wash off 5. Podofilox 0.5% topical gel (Condylox): appl y b.i.d. for 3 days x 4 weeks. No more than 10 cm2 area. 6. -Interferon: 1,000,000 units s.c. 3x per week for 4-6 weeks 7. Efudex cream (5 FU, 5%): massage small amount into skin 2 nights per week for 10 weeks. Cleanse skin next AM. Alert pati ent to expected symptoms (burning). Contraindicated in pregnancy B. Ablative techniques indicated for condyloma and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia 1. Laser (CO 2) or ultrasonic surgical aspiration: best cosmetic result on mucosal surfaces 2. Wide local excision: best results on hair-bearing surfaces (Wright VC) C. Laser ablation 1. Clinical utility depends on use of appropriate wavelength. The CO 2 laser is most applicable to ablation of condyloma, dysp lasia, and carcinoma-in-situ. The 10,600 nM wavelength is absorbed by water, result ing in tissue vaporization. Absorption occurs at the surface. Thermal damage to underlying tissue is minimized 2. Power density must be adequate to prevent char a. PD (Watts/cm 2)=(Watts x 100)/ r2, r = spot radius (not diameter). b. Use of a motorized handpiece (Silk Touch) will result in a smoother and more uniform depth of ablation c. A colposcope may be used to guide the laser. Low power Helium Neon laser (red beam) is used for aiming. Eye protection mandatory 3. Depth of laser ablation must be below the basement membrane for dysplasia treatment a. Ablate to a depth of 1-2 or 2.5 mm in non-hairbearing skin and hairbearing skin, respectively (Morrow, Baggish) Gyn Onc Overview , Page 52 R. Kevin Reynolds, MD b. Surgical Planes defined by Reid use visual landmarks to determine depth Plane Tissue vaporized Healing Landmark Technique 1 Condy Proliferating epithelium No scar \"Opalescent debris\" Single brush, wipe with moist gauze 2 Superficial papillary dermis No scar \"Chamois\" Plane1, then rapid brush 3 VIN Superficial reticular dermis Mild scar \"Water-logged cotton\" Plane 1, then slow brush 4 Deep reticular dermis Scar \"Sand grains\" Plane 3, then slow brush 4. Operative Technique a. Requires anesthesia b. Ice vulvar skin and drape surrounding area with wet towels c. Stain epithelium with 5% acetic acid and mark lesions d. Set power density to 600-750 W/cm2; 15-20 W with spot size of 2 mm e. Frequently wipe char fr om area during ablation 5. Post Operative Care a. Sitz bath b.i.d. until re-epithelialized b. Blow dry on low setting, then apply neomycin-bacitracin ointment c. Separate labia b.i.d. to prevent coaptation. Foley if periurethral tissues ablated d. For discomfort, moist tea bag compresses b.i.d. after sitz baths e. Follow weekly until re-epithelialization complete 6. Treatment Results a. Condyloma and VIN: 70-90% success at 2 years D. Ultrasonic Surgical Aspiration (Rader) 1. Uses mechanical vibration to cavitate tissue allowing aspiration of the disease 2. Unlike laser, specimen can be submitted for histology 3. Operative Technique a. Stain epithelium with 5% acetic acid and mark lesions b. Set power to 5-6 on CUSA and ablate to a depth of 2-2.5 mm 4. Post Operative Care as for la ser ablation, although pain less severe 5. Treatment Results: Condyloma and VIN 78% success at 50 weeks E. General Principles of Electrosurgery 1. Radio frequency current (350 KHz-3.3 MHz) results in kinetic energy transfer to intracellular ions which vaporizes intracellu lar water. Avoid Faradic Effect (50 Hz-200 KHz), which stimulates muscle and nerve c ausing pain by using Excision Procedure 1. Technique a. Lesion outlined using acetic acid and colposcope b. Anesthetize with 1% Lidocaine with epinephrine c. Choose loop to excise lesion d. Excise tissue in single pass, using 34 - 40 W, blend mode e. Cauterize base with ball elec trode at 50 W, coagulation mode f. Apply Monsel's solution 2. Advantages a. Diagnostic and therapeutic interventi on, potentially with one clinic visit b. Histologic specimen improves diagnostic accuracy c. Equipment less costly than laser Gyn Onc Overview , Page 53 R. Kevin Reynolds, MD VII. Staging of Invasive Disease. A. Vulvar cancer staging is surgical. AJ CC and FIGO staging systems are identical. This system applies for all tumor types other than melanoma B. Staging assessment may require cystoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, and chest X-ray for locally advanced lesions. TNM system (FIGO, Revised 1995) T1: Tumor confined to vulva, 2 cm in largest diameter. T1a Tumor invades 1mm T1b Tumor invades > 1mm T2: Tumor confined to vulva, >2 cm in largest diameter. T3: Tumor of any size with spread to urethra, vagina, or anus. T4: Tumor of any size infiltrati ng bladder or rectal mucosa, and/or fixed to bone. N0: No lymph node metastases. N1: Unilateral regional node metastases. Bilateral regional node metastases. M0: No clinical metastases. M1: Spread to pelvic nodes or distant metastases. Stage Stage I: T1a-b Society for the Study of Vulvar Diseases (ISSVD) in 1984, and adopted by FIGO in 1995. Incidence of inguinal node metastases is < 1%. Conservative su rgical therapy without inguinal-femoral lymphadenectomy indicated. C. Melanoma staging is separate from the above and is based primarily on lesion thickness. 1. Microstaging systems for melanoma (Breslow, Chung, Clark) Stage Breslow Chung Clark I <0.76 mm Intraepithelial Intraepithelial II 0.76-1.5 1 mm mm 1-2 mm Filling dermal 2.26-3.0 mm > 2 mm Into reticular dermis V > 3 mm Into subcutaneous fat Into subcutaneous fat 2. American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) TNM system for melanoma, 2001 Primary Tumor Tis Melanoma in situ T1a Tumor < 1.0 mm in thickness, without ulceration and level II/III T1b Tumor < 1.0 mm in thickness, with ulceration or level IV/V T2a Tumor 1.01-2.0 mm in thickness without ulceration T2b 1.01-2.0 mm in thickness with ulceration T3a 2.01-4.0 mm in thickness without ulceration T3b Tumor 2.01-4.0 mm in thickness with ulceration T4a Tumor > 4.0 mm in thickness without ulceration T4b Tumor > 4.0 mm in thickness with ulceration Gyn Onc Overview , Page 54 R.

Stage microinvasive squamous carcinom a: Wide local excision without inguinal node dissection B. Stage I and II squamous carcinoma: Hemivulvectomy with unilateral inguinal within 1-2 cm of midline (Moore). 1. Margin adequacy. At UCLA 135 patients were retrospectively assessed for risk of recurrence based on margin of resection. If margin was > 1 cm, 0% recurred locally (0/91) and if margin was < 8 mm, 47% ( 21/44) developed local recurrence. Of the 23 who did not recur locally, 39% (9/23) developed distant metastases. superfi cial fascia of the urogenital diaphragm positive groin nodes: dissect c ontralateral groin, no adjuvant therapy 4. If 2 positive nodes, then radiation therapy to pelvis and groin increases survival from 30% to 60% by GOG randomized trial (Homesley). Gyn Onc Overview , Page 55 R. Kevin Reynolds, MD C. Stage III-IV Treatment is individualized according to size and location of the lesion. Options include: 1. Radical vulvectomy with unilateral or bilateral groin node dissection. For lesions involving anal mucosa or uret hra, treatment options are: 2. Exenteration for locally advanced dis ease in an individual who has been radiated previously or who is not a candidate for chemoradiation. 3. Neoadjuvant radiation therapy and chem otherapy with 5-fluor ouracil (and optional mitomycin), followed by standard surgical t herapy if any residual disease is detected (Burke). 70% chance of local contro l with chemoradiation alone (Boronow) D. Lymphadenectomy is both therapeutic and diagnostic. Conventional approach is superficial and deep lymphadenectomy. Superfici al node dissection without removal of deep nodes may have an 8% local recurrence rate representing a significant false negative rate. E. Sentinel node mapping is the standard of care for melanoma cases and is being tested prospectively by the GOG for squamous vulvar carcinoma. Both radiolymphoscintigraphy and blue dye are us ed to localize the sentinel node. The radiocolloid used is technetium 99 (450 \u00b5Ci 99T c) sulfur colloid (filtered to 0.2 \u00b5m) is injected intradermally in 4 sites at the per iphery of the tumor 2-4 hours pre-op. Gamma scan is performed and sentinel node(s) is mark ed. Films are brought with the patient to the OR. At beginning of surgical procedure, 8 ml of 1% isosulfan blue dye is injected intradermally at 4 sites around the periphery of the tumor. Incision is made over the sentinel node determined by lymphoscintigraphy and blue dye is located. Hand held gamma probe assists in localization of node(s). Specimen is submitted for frozen section. If negative, no further nodes are removed unless hand held probe identifies a second node(s) with > 10% of the sentinel node activity or > 150% of background activity. If the frozen section is posit ive, full lymphadenectomy may be warranted depending on the clinical protocol. The specimens are held for 2-6 t 1/2 before processing. (Fiorica, Moore, Levenback). Accuracy (Ross, Blue dye alone 69-89% Lymphoscintigraphy 83% 96-99% Histologic of serial sections. Immunohisto- chemistry staining for S-100 and HMB-45 may improve sensitivit y and specificity. (Johnson 1998) F. Special cases 1. Verrucous and basal cell carcinoma rarely spreads to nodes. Wide local excision or hemivulvectomy is sufficient therapy. 2. Paget's Disease is rarely invasive and rarely metastasizes. Wide excision is indicated. 3. Melanoma a. Older approach included radical vulvectomy with lymphadenectomy. b. Newer approach is to perform wide local excision (WLE) with sentinel node dissection on selected cases based on lesion thickness. (Johnson 1995-1998, Look, Piura, Rose) Gyn Onc Overview , Page 56 R.

Surgical Complications, and Reconstruction A. Wound breakdown 1. Acute breakdown following radical vulvectomy 50% and following radical hemivulvectomy 14% (Burrell) 2. Use of flaps for closure of large defects in creases primary intention rate of healing to 89% (Reid 1997) 3. Chronic defects include 5-25% incidence of rectocoele, cystocoele, and uterine prolapse (Morrow) B. Infections 1. Vulvar surgery is \"Clean Contaminated\" by American College of Surgeons classification 2. Risks for postoperative infection (Snyder) Increased risk of post-op infection Decreased risk of post-op infection Age > 66 or < 14 years Age 15-65 years Lengthy procedure Short procedure Shaving skin pre-op Clipping skin pre-op Excessive electrosurgery Irrigation Foreign bodies Inert or absorbable suture material 3. Most common organisms identified: Staphylococcus aureus, epidermidis, Streptococcus A & B, viridans , enterobacteriaceae and mixed anaerobes. (Snyder) 4. Antibiotic prophylaxis to cover likely organisms warranted C. Lymphocysts (Morrow) 1. Occur following 7-28% of inguinal lymphadenectomy 2. Prevent with closed suction dr ainage and minimization of resection 3. Treat with frequent aspiration 4. If aspiration unsuccessful, instill absolute ethanol or betadine to sclerose Gyn Onc Overview , Page 57 R. Kevin Reynolds, MD D. Lymphedema (Morrow) 1. Occurs following 7-19% of cases. 2. Treat with elevation and compression. 3. Diuretics sometimes helpful. 4. Lymphedema clinic referral for pneumatic compression and massage. 5. Chronic lymphedema increases risk for life threatening cellulitis and DVT. These problems may be chronic. E. Incontinence of urine or feces F. Sexual dysfunction G. Psychological problems H. Reconstruction techniques 1. Split thickness skin graft (Morrow) a. Indicated for coverage of superficial re sections too wide for primary closure and with preservation of subcutaneous fat pad. Typical case is resection for dysplasia, or Paget's disease. b. Dermatome used to harvest epithelium (0.016-0.018 inch thick) from anterior thigh or superior border of buttocks. Graft may need to be meshed to increase coverage. Non-meshed grafts require drainage incisions. c. Graft is sutured in place, Foley and rectal tubes are placed and a bolus (pressure dressing) is applied for 5 days 2. Cutaneous flaps for closure of small to intermediate sized defects a. Rhomboid (Gallup Figs. 15-6, 15-8, 15-9). i. Indicated for closure of intermediat e size defects, particularly on perineal body and posterior perineum. ii. Measure flap length to equal size of defect. Undermine surrounding skin to allow mobility of the flap. Close with modified mattress suture, keeping knots away from the flap side of the incision. iii. Apply pressure dressing for 24 hours and keep patient at bedrest for 5 days. Delay defecation for 2-3 days for posterior flaps. b. Lateral transposition (Knapstein Fig. 13) i. Indicated for closure of intermediat e size defects, particularly on perineal body and posterior perineum. ii. Measure flap length to equal size of defect. Flap length to width ratio should be 2 or less. Undermine surrounding skin to allow mobility of the flap. 3. Myocutaneous flaps for closure of large defects or defects in a previously radiated field a. Gracilis (Knapstein, Morrow Figs. 8-29, 8-31, Reynolds Figs. 5B, 5C). i. Muscle origin is the anterior portion of the inferior pubic arch and insertion is to the medial suppl y the 8-10 adductor magnus muscles. The saphenous vein is preserved anterior to the flap. ii. The flap design can be either an island or rotational flap. During dissection the skin should be sutured to the muscle and tissue handling should be gentle. iii. The flap is carefully rotated posteriorly and is sutured in place with closed suction drains in place. b. Tensor fascia lata (Knapstein, Hacker Fig. 10-13) i. Muscle origin is the anterior superio r iliac spine and insertion is the fibrous portion of the fascia lata. Blood supply is the lateral femoral circumflex artery. Gyn Onc Overview , Page 58 R. Kevin Reynolds, MD ii. The flap design is a rotational flap. During dissection the blood supply should be carefully preserved and tissue handling should be gentle. The flap can be up to 6 x 30 cm in size. c. Gluteus maximus (Knapstein, Hacker Fig. 10-14) i. pubic ramus, sacrum upper femur and fascia lata. Blood supply is the inferior gluteal artery. ii. The flap design can be either an island or rotational flap. The muscle is partially transected to the posterior skin incision to allow rotation. The flap can be up to 8 x 20 cm in size. d. Rectus abdominis (Knapstein, Morrow, Figs. 8-21, 8-23) i. Indicated for closure of large vulvar defects only if the bladder or rectum has also been removed as in the case of an exenteration. ii. Muscle origin is the symphysis pubis and in sertion is the thorax into the fascia of the intercostal muscles and cartilage of the rib cage. Blood supply for pelvic flaps is the inferior epigastric artery. iii. The flap design is an island flap. IX. Prognostic Factors and Survival A.

Ionizing radiation: >10 eV, the binding energy of electrons. UV light does not ionize. II. Energy, E=h; where h=Planck's constant, =frequency. Energy attenuates proportional to the inverse square of the distance from the source. III. Absorption=energy loss. A. Types of energy absorption 1. Photoelectric Effect: energy absorbed by inner shell electrons. Absorption proportional to cube of atomic number , a useful property for diagnostic X-rays. Energy range: 10-100 keV 2. Compton Effect: portion of energy absorbed by outer shell electron. Residual energy transmitted. Energy range: 100 keV-3 MeV 3. Pair Production: photon (E > 1.02 MeV) in teracts with nucleus to produce electron + positron pair B. Linear Energy Transfer (LET): energy absorpt ion over distance, a function of particle charge squared, particle velocity squar ed, and electron density of the target. -dE/dX =2/2, where x=distance, =charge, =electron density, =velocity C. Current unit: Gray = (Joules/kg) ; Old unit: rad = (100 ergs/g); 1 Gy = 100 rads. D. Isodose Curves Penumbra: lateral spread, a function of source size as well as beam energy. Depth-Dose Curves: function of beam energy and treatment fields. Skin Sparing: high energy beams transfer maximum energy 0.5-1.5 cm or more below skin surface. IV. Biological Effect of Radiation A. Cells are most radio-resistant in S and ear ly G2 phases of cell cycle. Radiation causes delay of cell cycle by blocking progression from G1 S and G2 M. B. h causes direct base damage and strand breaks. Oxygen free radicals indirectly cause DNA damage and formation requires presence of O 2 C. Cell Survival 1. Three theoretical models a. Single hit kinetics: N=N 0exp(-D/D 0), N=surviving cell number, D=radiation dose. High LET h kills cells with single hit kinetics b. Multiple hit kinetics: N=N 0{1-[1-exp(-D/D 0)]n}, quadratic kinetics: N=N 0exp(-D-D2), and describe probability of interacting lesions caused by single and double tracks, respectively. Low LET h (i.e. therapeutic megavoltage radiation therapy) effects best approximated by linear quadratic model 2. DNA repair mechanisms: endonuclease, exonuclease, DNA polymerase, DNA ligase, and photolyase enzymes. The more time a cell has before entering S phase, the more likely it is that successful repair will occur. 4-6h after radiation is sufficient for sub lethal damage repairs Gyn Onc Overview , Page 68 R. Kevin Rey nolds, MD 3. Survival Curve (Low LET h ) D0=dose defined by slope of log-linear region. Represents dose to reduce survival: N0.37N Dq=indication of capacity of cells to repair damaged DNA. Varies by cell type. Dq=0 Gy for marrow Dq=3 Gy for skin 4. Oxygen Enhancement Ratio: oxygenated ce lls are about 3x more sensitive to radiation than hypoxic cells. Hypoxia slow s cell cycle, which increases time for repair, and hypoxia inhibits fixation of damage to DNA caused by free radicals 5. Principles of Fractionation (the \"4 R's\"):Repair, Repopulation, Redistribution, Reoxygenation V. Radiation Sources A. Types of radiation 1. Gamma rays ( ): arise naturally in atomic nucleus, no mass, no charge 2. X-rays: manufactured by electron beam st riking tungsten target, no mass or charge 3. Beta particles ( ): free electrons, negative charge, small mass 4. Alpha particles ( ): Helium nucleus, positive charge, large mass B. Useful Isotopes Isotope Energy (MeV) Half particles from 32P penetrate 5-8 mm; those from 198Au penetrate 3 mm VI. Gynecologic Applications A.

Historically reported for Stage IC- II- IIIA epithelial tumors successfully debul ked to minimal residual disease ( 5 mm) as either primary or salvage therapy, as well as for Stage I-II-III dysgerminoma. Technique: open field AP-PA, to dose of 30 Gy with blocks to liver (22 Gy) and kidney (18 Gy). Fraction size of 100-150 cGy/d (Dembo) 2. Intraperitoneal 32P. Historically reported for Stage Ib-Ic epithelial tumors with no residual disease and no significant adhesions. Dose 15 mCi D. Vulva 1. Post-operative therapy: Indicated for >1 positive inguinofemoral node, any positive pelvic nodes, and for residual disease of t he vulva. Treatment ports customized, electrons commonly used for vulva/groins to maximize surface dose 2. Pre-operative therapy: Indicated for bulky T3-4 lesions to reduce tumor size, allowing less radical surgery. Concurr ent chemotherapy using 5-fluorouracil, cisplatin, and/or mitomycin C improves likelihood of remission 3. Primary treatment: High failure rate if RT utilized without resection of primary site. Radiation of verrucous carcinoma contraindicated E. Radiosensitizers: 5-fluorour acil and cisplatin used most often for radiosensitization outside of clinical trials VII. Clinical Complications (Reynolds): A. Acute: diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, myel osuppression, ovarian failure, skin burns B. Chronic: 10-20 years). VIII. Common Questions A. What is the relationship of anemia to cervical cancer treatment? A: Tumor hypoxia decreases efficacy of radiation by reduc ing oxygen free radical mediated cell damage. B. What is the difference when using electrons instead of photons for treatment? A: Electrons have mass and charge causing them to slow when they encounter tissue. This results in clinically us eful control of treatment depth Gyn Onc Overview , Page 70 R. Kevin Rey nolds, MD C. What is Point A? A: A point 2 cm above and 2 cm lateral to the tandem flange (external os) and represents the crossover point of the ut erine artery over the ureter. Point B is 3 cm lateral to Point A and represents the location of the obturator nodes. References Dembo AJ. Epithelial ovarian cancer: the of their management. In: Emergency care of the woman.

Static: (e.g. muscle, nerve) well differentiated, rarely undergo mitosis in adults 2. Expanding: (e.g. liver) proliferate in response to stress or injury These 2 population types are resistant to chemo as are G0 cells 3. Renewing: (e.g. marrow, GI mucosa) cons tant proliferation. Renewing cells are sensitive to chemotherapy. 4. Tumor growth rate is a function of cell cycle time, growth fraction, and death rate. 5. Cancer cells do not divide more rapidly than normal cells. B. Gompertzian growth: as tumor mass increas es, growth fraction decreases and doubling time increases. Doubling times usually range between 20-150 days C. Mechanisms of resistance 1. Goldie-Coldman hypothesis: a mathematic al model predicting the likelihood of somatic mutations capable of leading to drug resistance. Spontaneous mutations occur every 10,000 to 1,000,000 cell divisions . Hypothesis correctly predicts that multi-drug regimens minimize like lihood of developing resistant clones 2. Mechanisms of resistance may include: defec tive drug transport into the cell, altered drug activation, reduced hormone receptor number or affinity, enhanced DNA repair, gene amplification, altered target pr oteins, and increased drug metabolism. 3. Multi-drug resistance gene (MDR-1): c odes for P-glycoprotein P-170, an energy dependent efflux pump that reduces intrace llular drug levels. Once induced, cross resistance to multiple unrelated drugs occu rs (e.g. vinca alkaloids, glutathione S-transferase): involved in conjugation of toxic molecules, and inactivation of free radicals and peroxides. (e.g. cisplatin and radiation ther apy). Future medications may block this mechanism II. Pharmacokinetics A. Log kill hypothesis (Skipper): chemotherapy dr ugs act via first order kinetics, whereby a constant fraction of cells are killed with each treatment B. Therapeutic index (TI): ratio of therapeutic dose to toxic dose of a drug. Reflects differential sensitivity of normal and neoplastic cells to chemotherapy drugs. Chemotherapy drugs typically have low TI C. Dose Intensity (DI): DI=Drug, mg/m2/week. Especially important for cure of germ cell tumors. D. Cell cycle specificity, schedule dependency, drug distribution, drug metabolism and excretion, and drug interactions are all im portant in designing a treatment protocol III. Drug Development A. Phases of drug development 1. Phase I: determination of maximum tolerable dose, optimal schedule and dose limiting toxicity of a new drug 2. Phase II: testing for responses of various tumors to a new drug 3. Phase III: randomized study comparing effi cacy of different treatment regimens Gyn Onc Overview , Page 72 R. Kevin Rey nolds, MD B. Evaluation of responses: standardized nomenclature 1. Complete Response (CR): complete disappearance of all measurable and evaluable disease. No new lesions 2. Partial Response (PR): 50% decrease in the sum of the products of lesion diameters. No progression of ev aluable disease or new lesions 3. Stable Disease 4. Progression: 25% increase in the sum of products of measurable lesions, clear worsening of any evaluable disease, or appearance of any new lesion IV.

Cardiac Index (CI) = CO / BSA, wher e CO = cardiac output, BSA = body surface area. Normal CI = 2.5 - 3.5 L/min/m 2 4. Swan-Ganz pressure tracing J. Pressors 1. Dopamine. Increases renal, cerebral, and mesenteric flow at low doses (<5 mcg/kg/min). CO increases without c hanging BP. At doses >10 mcg/kg/min, receptor stimulation causes vasoconstr iction, increased BP Adverse effects: arrhythmia, ischemia, tissue necrosis (antidote: phentolamine nausea, MAO inhibitor (vasospasm) and phenytoin (hypotension) interactions. Premix: Dose: 2-20 mcg/kg/min 2. Dobutamine. Stimulates cardiac and -1 receptors and peripheral -2 receptors, resulting in increased CO and decreased SVR. CO increases and PAWP decreases without changing BP. Adverse effects: arrhyt hmia, ischemia, Dose: 2.5-20 mcg/kg/min * Dopamine and Dobutamine are complimentary when used concurrently 3. Norepinephrine. Stimulates cardiac -1 receptors and peripheral receptors, resulting in inotropic and vasopressor effect s. Adverse effects: arrhythmia, ischemia, tissue (antidote: phentolamine 10 mg in 15 mL saline). Prepare: 4 inotropic and vasodilator actions. Combined effects produc e an increase in cardiac stroke output without an increase in cardiac stroke work. Indicated as single agent therapy for low output states caused by systolic heart fa ilure. Initial loading dose 0.75 mg/kg, followed by continuous infusion ranging from 5 to 10 mcg/kg/min. Gyn Onc Overview , Page 94 R. Kevin Rey nolds, MD K. Vasodilators Premix: 50 mg in 500 mg thiosulfate. Adverse effects: dose: 0.3-0.4 mg Anti hypertensive Esmolol . Ultra-short-acting, cardioselective, -adrenergic blocking agent . Onset of action within 1 minute, with duration of 10-20 min. Metabolized via rapid hydrolysis of ester linkages by red blood cell esterases independent of renal or hepatic function. Available for IV use both as a bolus and as an infusion. Particularly useful in severe postop hypertension. It is a suitabl e agent in situations in which the cardiac output, heart rate, and blood pressure are increased. Typically given as a 0.5-1 mg / kg loading dose over 1 min, followed by an infusion starting at 50 mcg/kg-min and increasing up to 300 mcg/kg-min. 2. Fenoldopam. Dopamine DA1 agonist, shor t acting and has advantage of increasing renal blood flow and sodium excretion. Structur e is similar to that of dopamine, but is highly specific for DA1 receptors and is 10 times more potent than dopamine as a renal vasodilator. Rapidly metabolized by conjugation in the liver, without cytochrome P450 enzymes. Onset of action is within 5 min, and maximal achieved by 15 min . Duration of action is 30 - 60 min, with the pressure gradually returning to pretreatment values without rebound once infusion stopped . No adverse effects reported. Starting dose is 0.1 mcg / kg-mi n. Causes a consistent dose-related decrease in blood pressure in the dose range 0.03-0.3 mcg / kg-min. Improves creatinine clearance, urine flow rates, and s odium excretion in severely hypertensive patients with both normal and impai red renal function. Is drug of choice in severely hypertensive patients with impaired renal function 3. Labetalol. A selective 1- and nonselective -adrenergic receptor blocker with an / blocking ratio of 1 / 7. Metabolized by liv er to form inactive glucuronide conjugate. Hypotensive effect begins within 2 - 5 min after IV dosing, reaching a peak at 5 - 15 min and lasting for about 2 - 4 hours. Because of -blocking effects, heart rate is maintained or slightly reduced. Unlike pure -adrenergic blocking agents that decrease cardiac output, maintains cardiac output. Reduces systemic vascular resistance without reducing total peripheral blood flow. Cerebral, renal, and coronary blood flow is maintained. Used in pregnancy - induced hypertensive crises because little placental transfer occurs, mainly due to the drug's negligible lipid solubility. Labetalol may be given as a loading dose of 20 mg, followed by repeated incremental doses of 20 - 80 mg given at 10 - min intervals until the desired blood pressure is achieved. Alternatively, after the loading dose, an infusion starting at 1-2 mg / min is titrated until the desired effect is achieved. Bolus injections of 1-2 mg/kg produce precipitous fall in blood pressure and should be avoided. 4. Nicardipine. A second generation dihydropy ridine derivative calcium channel blocker with high vascular selectivity and strong cerebral and coronary vasodilator. 100 times more water soluble than is nifedipine, and therefore can be administered IV. Onset of action of is 5 - 15 min with durat ion of 4 - 6 hours. Crosses the blood - brain barrier and reaches CNS, where it bi nds to L-type calcium channels primarily in the hippocampus. IV nicardipine reduces cardiac and cerebral ischemia. Appropriate dosage is independent of weight, with an initial infusion rate of 5 mg / Gyn Onc Overview , Page 95 R. Kevin Rey nolds, MD hour, increasing by 2.5 mg / hour every 5 min to a maximum of 30 mg / hour. 5. Hydralazine. A direct acting vasodilator. Following IM or IV administration, initial latency period of 5 - 15 min is followed by a progressive and often precipitous fall in blood pressure that can last up to 12 hours. Although circulating half - life is about 3 hours, the half - life of effect on blood pressure is100 hours. Because of prolonged and unpredictable antihypertensive effects and the inability to titrate the drug's hypotensive effect effectively, hydralazine is best avoided in the management of hypertensive crises. 6. Clonidine. 2-adrenergic receptor for postop 7. CAUTION: Hold ACE inhibitors in the immediate post-op period due to risk of pronounced hypotension that is not correctable with IV fluid bolus. III.

Kevin Rey nolds, MD Key: LDUH = Low dose LMWH weight compression stockings; IPC = intermittent pneumatic = Vitamin 5. Prophylaxis a. Mini-dose heparin: 5000 Units SC bid or tid. Thrombocytopenia rare. May be ineffective for patients with gyn malignancy b. Pneumatic compression stockings c. Low molecular weight heparin i. Enoxaparin (Lovenox): 40 mg SC daily or if weight > 150 kg, then 30 mg SC BID. Reduce dose for renal impairment. Do not administer with ketorolac (Toradol) due to risk of hemorrhage d. Greenfield filter: for patients at high risk who cannot be anticoagulated 6. Summary of Recommendations for gynecologic surgery (Schunemann 2004) a. Patients undergoing brief procedures 30minutes for benign disease require only early, aggressive mobilization b. Patients undergoing laparoscopic gyn procedures, in whom additional VTE risk factors are present should receive thromboprophylaxis with one or more of the following: LDUH, LMWH, IPC, or GC S (See key in section V.A.4 above) c. Thromboprophylaxis should be used in all patients undergoing major gynecologic procedures. i. Major gynecologic surgery for benign disease, without additional risk factors should receive LDUH 5000 U bid. Alternatives include daily LMWH, or IPC started just before surgery and used c ontinuously while the patient is not ambulating ii. Patients undergoing extensive surgery for malignancy, and for patients with additional risk factors for VTE should receive LDUH 5000 U tid, or a higher dose LMWH. Alternative considerati ons include IPC alone continued until hospital discharge, or a combination of LDUH or LMWH plus mechanical prophylaxis with GCS or IPC iii. For patients undergoing major gynecol ogic surgery it is suggested that prophylaxis continue until di scharge from hospital. In patients who are at particularly high risk, including those who have undergone cancer surgery and who are > 60 years of age, or have a previous history of VTE, it is suggested that prophylaxis continue for 2 to 4 weeks after hospital discharge . 7. Pulmonary embolus a. Diagnosis suggested by history, sym ptoms, and high clinical suspicion b. Spiral CT scan or V / Q scan may be used for diagnosis c. Gold standard is angiography, but morbidity is higher d. Treatment: full therapeutic ant icoagulation with LDUH or LMWH B. Transfusions: selective use indicated due to risk of infection, and transfusion reactions VI. Endocrine System A. Diabetes (Jacober 1999) 1. Surgical stress and some general anest hetic agents increase counter regulatory hormones (epinephrine, norepinephrine, gl ucagons, growth hormone, and cortisol) and increase insulin resistance, thereby increasing hepatic glucose production and decreased peripheral insulin utilization. Th is leads to hyperglycemia and ketogenesis in pts with type 1 diabetes. Gyn Onc Overview , Page 102 R. Kevin Rey nolds, MD 2. Operative morbidity and mortality in cr itically ill patients is decreased with tight glucose control. Post-operative goals and approaches to critically ill patients should target glucose 150 to 200 mg / dL. (Van den Berghe), although morbidity is better if glucose levels are maintained < 150 mg/dL. 3. On morning of surgery, give 1/2 usual dose of antihyperglycemics. Patients taking metformin should discontinue the drug on the day of surgery because complications or alterations in renal function arising intraoperatively may potentiate the risk of developing lactic acidosis. Maintain post-op glucose control with individualized sliding scale regimen using subcutaneous insulin on a sliding scale. In pts who are critically ill or who fail to respond to subc utaneous protocols, change to insulin drip 4. Watch for signs of lactic acidosis (sepsis ), ketoacidosis (hyperglycemia), electrolytes disturbances, and end-organ diseases (heart, kidneys, eyes) in diabetics B. Thyroid Disease 1. Hypothyroidism: Does not appreciably in crease operative risk, but initiation of medication should not be delayed. Watch for pericardial effusion; decreased inspiratory reserve volume, stroke volume, EKG voltage and SVR 2. Hyperthyroidism: Thyroid storm occurs in 10% of hyperthyroid patients undergoing surgery. Elective surgery should be delay ed 3 months while disease controlled with PTU. For emergency surgery, treat ment with \u00df-blocker indicated C. Steroid Dependence 1. Patients on chronic steroid treatment ( 7.5 mg prednisone daily) have suppressed hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal axis and r equire steroid pulse perioperatively. HPA axis can remain suppressed for a year after completing steroid therapy 2. Usual steroid pulse: Hydrocortisone, 100 mg IVPB q6 - 8h. Pulse duration and rate of taper customized to fit patient needs 3. Signs of HPA axis insufficiency: malaise, low fever, nausea, arthralgia, electrolyte disturbances 4. Use of steroids in HPA suppressed pati ents can be of benefit, especially in patients who are critically ill and experienc ing evidence of sepsis. (Annane) VII. Gastrointestinal System A. Pre-op bowel prep Fleets AcuPrep or 4 liters Golytely, or 2 bottles magnesium citrate given about 18 hours preop B. Post-op gastric erosions common in critic ally ill patients. 5% will have hemodynamically significant bleeding (80% mortality) C. Gastric Erosion Prophylaxis: 1. IV H2 blockers (e.g. Zantac 50 mg IVPB q8h) 2. Nasogastric tube administered antac ids, titrate gastric fluid to pH 3.5 VIII. Prophylactic Antibiotics : warranted for all gynecologic oncology surgery. 1-2 doses of cefoxitin (dose: 2 gm prior to incision then Q6 hours x 3 doses) or cefazolin adequate. First dose should be given 1-2 hours before incision. References Annane D, Fan E, Herridge.

Energy Tools A. Electrosurgery. Use of radiofrequency current to divide or coagulate tissue for hemostasis. 1. Water Tower Analogy Volts equals water column (pressure) Current equals volume of water through pipe over time Resistance equals diameter of pipe Ohm's Law : V=IR 2. Types of electrosurgery in clinical use Monopolar Bipolar Cutting. High voltage sine wave. Divides tissue with less thermal damage than coagulation. Coagulation. Spark gap current heats tissue to coagulate vessels. Devitalizes tissue. Blend. Mixture of cutting and coagulation. Argon beam Gyn Onc Overview , Page 113 R. Kevin Rey nolds, MD 3. Electrosurgical Effect on Cells Radiofrequency current transfers energy to Sine oscillation of ions, imparting heat to intracellular water causing cell to burst 4. Current Path Through Tissue Current passes from the electrode through tissue and returns through the ground electrode 5. Effect of Waveform on Tissue a. Cutting Sine wave Low voltage (1000 volts at 50 Watts power) Current arcs to tissue across steam envelope Less heating of tissue than coagulation waveform b. Coagulation (Fulguration) Uses spark gap current Current arcs to tissue Causes heating and necrosis of tissue c. Desiccation Uses spark gap current High voltage (5000 volts at 50 watts) Direct contact to tissue Causes heating and necrosis of tissue High voltage (5000 volts at 50 watts) Gyn Onc Overview , Page 114 R. Kevin Rey nolds, MD 6. Monopolar vs. Bipolar a. Monopolar: Current passes from elec trode to grounding pad through body of patient. More risk! b. Bipolar: Current passes from active electrode to return electrode only. Less surrounding tissue damaged c. Bipolar Vessel Sealers Microprocessor controls current to tissue to cause controlled tissue melting Capable of sealing vessels up to 7 mm Brands: Gyrus, Ligasure, Enseal Monopolar Bipolar Gyn Onc Overview , Page 115 R. Kevin Rey nolds, MD 7. Complications of Electrosurgery a. Injury to adjacent structures by arcing or heating tissue Poor technique Instrument failure b. Consequence of injury may be delayed (e.g. bowel perforation or ureteral stricture) c. Capacitance: Occurs when energy is transferred to adjacent metal structure through an insulator. Can cause injury remote from instrument tip Capacitance is produced by the conductor within the insulated shaft of laparoscopic instruments Capacitance injury can occur out of the visual field (rectangle) if an organ is near to the instrument shaft Site of burn B. Mechanical. Uses ultrasonic energy transmi tted to tissue as mechanical vibration to heat tissue. Results in cell lysis. Protein melt seals vessels. 1. Shears and scalpels. Instrument shaft oscillates at 25-55 KHz. Used for dividing small vessels, ovarian cystectomy, colpotomy incision. Several brands: Harmonic, (CUSA). Oscillates at 55Khz. Used for tumor debulking. Shakes tumor apart Gyn Onc Overview , Page 116 R. Kevin Rey nolds, MD C. Laser. Light Amplification through Stimulated Emission of Radiation. Generates a coherent beam of light: in- phase, single frequency. Wavelength and energy determines interaction with tissue. 1. Wavelength and laser type. The primary laser used for gynecology is the CO2 laser. It is an infrared laser (10,600 nanometer wavelength). Absorption occurs superficially by intracellular water resulting in controlled surface ablation. In contrast, YAG lasers penetrate deeply and coagulates vessels, which is useful for bleeding tumor. 2. Power density determines whether tissue will be coagulated or vaporized. Power Density = power/spot size = watts/r2 . To ablate without char, power density should be 750-1000 watts per cm2. 3. Laser modes. Determines energy delivery as a function of time. Continuous Intermittent Superpulse Chopped pulse Silk Touch: motorized beam pattern improves cosmetic results 4. Eye protection is required for safety. Beam defocuses over distance. Proper spacing between instrument and tissue is critical for appropriate power density XIII. Staplers A. Bowel 1. Gastrointestinal anastamosis (GIA). Staples and divides.
