Objectives -The purpose of this literature review is to identify the health and illness attitudes, beliefs, and behavi ors that are unique to parents who refuse to vaccinate their children. Methods -Twelve published studies conducted in the United States between 1998 and 2008 were accumulated from three major database sources: PubMed, EBSCOhost , and Science Direct. Studies were evaluated based on comm on attitudes, beliefs and behaviors observed in the course of the studies. Results : A total of ten studies were iden tified between 1998 and 2008 based on the inclusive criteria provide d. Studies included one qualit ative study, two case control studies, and seven cross-section studies. Pare ntal concerns with vaccine safety ranged from 6.7%-93.4%, with the highest percentages of concern from parent with unvaccinated children. Conclusion : Parental trust in vaccinations and their mandating is diminishing in the United States. Various measures are needed to be enforced in order to regain confidence in vaccination safety.

This increasing number of unvaccinated children can be observed in the last eight years (2000-2008) as vaccine coverage rates have begun to fall. In the 2007, US National Immunization Survey for children 19-35 months old, resear chers established the US nati onal average for Diphtheria, 85.1% and 92.9 % (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2007). In 2000-2001 the same survey found the identical vacc inations to have coverage ranges between 89.3% to 94.3% (CDC, 2001). Over a seven year period surveillance of vaccination coverage have observed a 2%-4% decrease in some of the most important childhood vaccines. This decline in rates has been attributed a growing population of parents choosing not to vaccinate their children. Re searchers have found most populations with unvaccinated children to encompass parents with similar demographics; the majority of these parents tend to be disproportiona tely white married mothers with a college degree and household annual incomes exceeding $75,000 (Smith, Chu, Barker, 2004). Additionally this consistent population appears to have a growing homeschool ed community with increasing numbers of unvaccinated children. A 2005 study found parents who homeschooled have the least belief in the importance of vaccinations compared to parents whose children attend public or private schools. Furthermore, these same parents had the lowest proportion of respondents who would fully immunize if it were not required by law (59%) in comparison to parents of children attending public (77%) or private (86%) schools (Kennedy, Brown, Gust, 2005) . One of the greatest barriers to reaching this population is the inability of medical personnel to convince pa rents to alter their beliefs to 2 not vaccinate even when valid evidence is presented. In a 1996 study researchers establish the following conclusions, \"when nonvaccinators in our study were presented with the sort of risk- benefit information that leads many medical and pub lic health experts to c onclude that the risks of the disease are worse than the risks of the vaccine, they became more committed to nonvaccination, not less. Parents in each group apparently focused on that evidence in the information that would strengthen their previous ly held views, while discounting evidence that would not\" (Meszaros, p.697). An essential el ement for decreasing the growing trend of unvaccinated children is to uncover the reason(s ) for parents maintaining such a strong opposition to vaccinations even when scientific evidence demonstrates otherwise. Although many of these parents are making individual ch oices concerning vaccinations, healthcare providers in the US have begun to observe hea lth impacts to the gene ral population directly related to the growing number of individual decisions. Currently the United States has begun to observe six consequences attributable to increasing numbers of unvaccinated children: ep idemics in various childhood diseases; possible new vaccine preventable diseases; redu ction in herd immunity; increase cost related to treatment and disease containment; increasing pediatric dismissals of parents refusing to vaccinate. With many of these pa rents having similar demographics, an important question is whether their beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors also show comparable categories. Developing a common framework of categories of vaccination concerns is cr itical for public health professionals attempting to reduce this growi ng trend through program and policy development. Purpose of the Study The purpose of this literature review is to id entify the health and illness attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors that are unique to parents who re fuse to vaccinate thei r children reported in 3 literature from 1998-2007. Frequently observed be liefs, attitudes and behaviors of anti- vaccination parents will be arra nged to identify potentially si milar thinking development. Research questions What health and illness attitudes, belief s and behaviors are observed in parents of unvaccinated children? What rationale do most parents state fo r their apprehension for vaccinations? What are the reasons parents provide for not vaccinating their children? Which strategies for persuading parents to vaccinate their children have been most effective? Delimitations The study was delimited by: Research data and reports available in the English language from 1998 to 2007. Studies on the vaccination views of parents of children under the age of eighteen years old. Limitations Although there are a variety of vaccinations available to children al l over the world, this study is limited to research on vaccinations comm only required in the United States of America to children under the age of eighteen. Also study results focusing on parents with verified religious reasons for exemption will not be incl uded in this literature review due to the United 4 States of America's Bill of Right Amendment I , which allows for free exer cise of religious beliefs and the differences in population with religious objection compar ed to philosophical objectors. Assumptions For the purpose of the study, the fo llowing assumptions will be made: Research findings collectively represent anti -vaccine parents with safety concerns in the United States of America. Safety concerns raised by an ti-vaccine parents are similar. Information being selected from research stud ies are accurate and re flects correctly the data being presented. Although side effects have been shown to occu r with vaccinations, cu rrently vaccinations provide the most comprehensive prevention method available for Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, Poliovirus, Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Meningococcal. 5 Definition of Terms General terms Attitude-\"a settled way of thinki ng or feeling, typically reflect ed in a person's behavior\". (Lindberg, 2002, p.78) Behavior-\"the way in which one acts or conducts oneself, especially towa rds others\". (Lindberg, 2002, p. 116) Belief- \"an acceptance that a statement is true or that something exists\". (Lindberg, 2002, p. 118) Case Control Study- To examine the possible re lation of an exposure to a certain disease. Identify two groups, individuals with that disease ( cases ) and individuals without the disease (controls ). Then determine what proportions of ca ses were exposed and what proportion were not. The same method is applied to the c ontrol group. These long-term or short-term retrospective studies are then evaluated for causal relationships. (Gordis, 2004, p. 159 and p.174) Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) - Agency under the department of Health and Human services in the United States of Amer ica with a fiscal budget for 2009 of $8.8 billion. (CDC, 2008a) The mission of the organization is \"to promote health and quality of life by preventing and controlling disease, injury, and disability\" and the 21st century vision of the agency is \"Healthy People in a Heal thy World\u2014Through Prevention\". (CDC, 2008 b) Cohort Study- The investigator selects a group of exposed individuals and a group of nonexposed individuals and follows up both groups to compare the o ccurrence of disease (or rate of death from disease) in the two groups. Due to the identification of new (occurrences) cases of disease as they occur, we can determine whet her a temporal relationship exist between the 6 exposure and the disease, that is, whether the exposure preceded the onset of the disease. (Gordis, 2004, p. 149-150) Cross-Sectional Study- Define a population, at a specific period of time, and determine the presence or absence of exposur e and the presence or absence of disease for each individual. Based on this information the defined population is divided into four groups: exposed/ have disease; exposed/ to not have disease; not e xposed/ have disease; not exposed; do not have disease. Without a chronological relations hip between exposure and outcome a causal relationship cannot be establishe d only the frequency of the di sease. (Gordis, 2004, p. 173-174) Vaccination status terms Fully Vaccinated Children-minors between the ages of 0-18 who are up to date on the immunization schedule recommended by the CD C and/or their personal pediatrician: Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis (DTaP) [5 doses ], vaccinated Children-minors who have begun the series of vaccinations recommended by the CDC, but are not up to date on their r ecommended immunization sche dule .(Smith, et al., 2004) Unvaccinated Children -minors who have \"received no vaccina tions\". (Smith, et. al. 2004, p 188) 7 US Childhood preventable vaccinations and diseases Common vaccinations- Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis disease develops as the resu lt of the toxin producing bacteria strain of Corynebacterium diphtheria . The two most common clinical features of the disease are respiratory diphtheria and cutane ous diphtheria. Transmission of the disease is mainly through direct person-to -person contact through intim ate respiratory and phys ical contact. Common complications for the respiratory diphtheria includemyocarditis, polyneuritis, and airway obstruction; 5%-10% of deaths occur due to respiratory cases. Cutaneous diphtheria cases have considerably less complications and deaths. (CDC, 2005 a) Hepatitis A- An acute liver disease produced by the Hepatitis A virus (HAV) which can produce symptoms up to 6 months after infection. Pres ently the virus has not been found to lead to chronic infections and death doe s not usually occur. Generally transmission of the disease has been found to be through the ingestion of fecal matter, even in small quantities. Asymptomatic cases have been found in 70% of infected childre n younger than 6 years of age. Individuals older than 6 years of age have a 70% chance of developing symptoms. Co mmon symptoms of the disease are: fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, clay- colored bowel movements, joint pain, and jaundice. (CDC, 2008 e) Hepatitis B- A highly communicable virus, Hepatitis B virus (HBV), that can survive outside of the body at least 7 days and still produce infections. There are thre e possible stages of infection acute, chronic, and perinatal. Chronic HBV re sults in an estimated 2,000-4,000 death per year. 8 Common transmissions of the disease are as follows: sex with an infected partner, injection drug use that involves sharing needles, syringes, or dr ug-preparation equipment, birth to an infected mother, contact with blood or open sores of an inf ected person, needle sticks or sharp instrument exposures, and sharing items such as razors or toothbrushes with an infected person. Complications for the disease are permanen t liver damage and cirrhosis. (CDC, 2008 e) Measles- A respiratory disease from the virus Rubeola that develops in the back of the throat and lining of the lungs. About one out of one thous and children will develop encephalitis which can lead to mental retardation and/ or deafness. Since the disease can be spread up to four days prior and after to symptoms, infected individuals ar e able to spead the disease quite rampantly. Individuals in close contact with the infected individual have a 90% chance of developing measles. (CDC, 2008 f) Meningococcal- A severe bacterial infec tious attributed most commonly to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitides. Infection of the disease is called meningitis and can also be the result of a viral infection, which usual is less severe and requires less treatment. Although there are antibiotics for bacterial meningitis, th e risk of dying from the infection can only be reduced to ~85%. (CDC, 2008g) Mumps- An acute viral infection that develops due to the mumps virus and currently does not have medical treatment options. Common symptoms of the disease are fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite; followed by swelling of salivary glands. In many cases the parotid salivary glands are imp acted the most. Rare complications associated with this disease are inflammation of the brain and/or ti ssue covering the brain and spinal cord (encephalitis/meningitis), inflammation of the te sticles (orchitis), inflammation of the ovaries 9 and/or breasts (oophoritis and mastitis), spontane ous abortion, and possible permanent deafness. (CDC, 2008 h) Pertussis- An extremely communicable bacterial disease, Bordetella pertussis , which can manifest itself for many weeks in children causing severe coughi ng, whooping and posttussive vomiting. The most vulnerable for this diseas e are infants and young children; complications include hypoxia, apnea, pneumonia, seizures, encephalopathy, and malnutrition. In 2003, 13 American deaths were attributed to Pertussis infections. (CDC, 2005 b) Poliovirus- A highly infectious nervous system di sease with up to 95 % of infected individuals being asymptomatic. Less than 1% of infected in dividuals will result in permanent paralysis. (CDC, 2007 a) Rubella- An acute infections due to the Rube lla virus that mildly inpacts children and young adults. The most serious cases are found main ly in pregnant women who can develop the following complications themselves or in the unb orn fetus: birth defect s, deafness, cataracts, heart defects, mental retardati on, and liver and spleen damage. There are no current treatment options for infected individuals at the present time. (CDC, 2008i) Tetanus - An acute bacteria l disease attributed to Clostridium tetani ; this disease has become well known for muscle rigidity and painful spasms through out the development of the disease. A neurotoxin produced by the bacteria through anae robic tetanus bacilli grows in contaminated wound where it flourishes. There are three clin ical syndromes associated with tetanus: generalized, localized, and cephali c; although these various syndromes exist, th e clinical course of tetanus is extremely variable on prior amounts of immunity, amount of toxin present, and age 10 and general health of the patient. Currently gene ralized tetanus, the most common form (80%) of tetanus infections, has a mortalit y rate of 10%-20%. (CDC, 2007 b) Importance of the study An individual parent choosing not to vaccinate their children poses a critical threat to the health of other individuals living in their communities. This threat becomes amplified when large numbers of parents begin to make similar decision in clustered communities. Being able to understand variables leading to such an intens e belief is essential to developing programs targeting this growing populat ion and improvement of specifi c governmental policies. Through identifying frequently observed beliefs, attit udes and behaviors of an ti-vaccination parents, researchers are able to build up a systematic framework for helping hi gh risk populations of parents make vaccine decisions. 11 CHAPTER 2 LITERATURE REVIEW Unvaccinated children create a health thre at to both themselves and communities surrounding them. Investigating the causes of this de veloping trend in the Unite d States is vital to evaluating current vaccination la ws, reducing disease outbreaks, and ultimately allow parents a realistic view of vaccinations benefits and risks. One of the primary reasons for a recent increase in unvaccinated children is the growing trend fo r states to allow for various exemptions to vaccines. Current vaccine exemption laws As of 2008 all states in the US except Missis sippi and West Virginia allow for religious exemptions from vaccination; 21 states allow additional exemptions for personal beliefs (Institute for Vaccine Safety, 2007) or philosoph ical reasons. Among those states offering the additional nonmedical exemptions, there has been an observable increase in rates of exemptions compared to states with only re ligious exemptions (Omer,Pan, Ha sley, et al., 2006). In addition many of the states offering nonmedical exemptions make it simpler and less time consuming to submit the exemption rather than comply with the current vaccine re gulations. Few of the nonmedical exemptions states require any type of vaccine counseling or interventions for parents submitting the exemptions and most states do not have any system in place to register the vaccination status of home-schooled child ren. (Rota, Salmon, Rodewald, Chen, Hibbs, Gangarosa, 2001) North Carolina is one of the few states which requi res proof of vaccinations or records of approved exemptions regardless of a child's school status. (Khalili, Caplan, 2007, p 474). In a comparison to 2007 the national vacci nation averages, DTaP (85.1%), MMR(92.4%), Polio(92.7%), and HepB (92.9%), DTaP (88.5%), MMR(97.6%), Polio(94.4%), and HepB (92.4%). (CDC, 2007) With an increase in 12 exemption options, various states and health care communities have begun to experience the impact of unvaccinated children. Current health related dilemmas attr ibuted to unvaccinated children Throughout this year (2008) the CDC has re ported an epidemic number of measles cases in the US. In the first four m onths of this year 64 cases of measles have been reported in comparison to only 55 cases for the entire year of 2007(CDC, 2008e). A 1999 study found that individuals who have not received the meas les vaccine are highly more vulnerable for contracting measles (Salmon, Haber, Gangaro sa, Phillips, Smith, Chen) and potentially developing an extensive list of co mplications: ear infection, encepha litis, pneumonia, diarrhea or vomiting, bronchitis, laryngitis or croup, pregna ncy complications, and low platelet count (MayoClinic.com, 2008). Among health provider s one of the greatest concerns with unvaccinated children is their ability to spread preventable diseases to individuals with valid medical contraindications to immunizations, you ng infants not yet of age to be vaccinated, individuals whose vaccination was not effective, and individuals undergoing medical treatments reducing their immunity and vaccination status ( Kennedy, Brown, Gust, 2005) such as cancer patients and HIV patients. Currently the medi cal community has become concerned with the spread of various vaccine preventable disease an d the possibility of new vaccine resistant strains of these diseases entering the US. Over the past 30 years such concerns were nominal in the US due to high vaccination rates although many count ries around the world are experiencing the deadly impact of these diseases. Evolution of viruses As recently as 1998, researchers warned of the evolution of measles virus into hypermutated forms which have According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Strokes , a more familiar name of the disease is Dawson Disease. This mutated m easles virus is a chronic persistent infection of the central nervous system which is found primar ily in children and young adults and usually has a progressive downhill course which results in death. Those who survive the general measles virus, they have a 5% chance of spontaneous re mission with SSPE. It can occur anywhere from two to ten years after the original measles il lness, and generally results in progressive neurological deterioration due to brain inflammation and nerve cell death. Current research has shown high incidence of SSPE in the Middle Ea st and India (2007). A lthough currently this disease has been mostly eliminated in th e US, between 1956 and 1981 the CDC discovered 368 individuals who met the case defi nition of having SSPE in the US ; 55% (202) had a history of only measles infection; 14% (51) had a history of only measles v accination; and 17% (63) had a history of both, with th e natural illness most frequently pr eceding the vaccination. The remaining 14% (52) gave no positive history of having na tural measles infection or measles vaccination (CDC, 1982). In a follow up study in 2005, researcher s discovered that data in the this more current study suggest a risk of developing SSPE that is approximately ten times higher after measles virus infection in young children than the original risk of developing SSPE estimated in 1982 (Bellini, Rota, Lowe, Katz, Dyken, Zaki, Shieh, Rota, 2005,). Although this disease is rare in the US, in 2000 a notice from the CDC attribut ed the death of a 13 year old adopted child from Thailand to SSPE. Apparently the child may ha ve contracted measles nine years earlier in an orphanage in Thailand (Bonthius, Stanek, Gr ose). Even though this mutated virus has not become epidemic in the United States, it does app ear that if the measles virus is spread and contracted by unvaccinated children this can lead to this mutated virus two to ten years after the original infections. 14 Decrease in herd immunity Another essential aspect to the increasing epidemic of vaccine preventable diseases is a decrease in herd immunity. Fo r years parents of unvaccinated children and individuals with reduced immunities have been able to depend on the assumption that most individuals in a community were vaccinated and th us reducing exposure to various life threatening diseases. This belief in the herd immunity has been a huge component of anti-vaccination argument. Unfortunately the herd immunity only can function if the immunization rates of coverage stay between 92%-95% (Marfe, 2007). The 2007 immunizati on coverage rates for four of the major vaccines are on the edge of falling below the 92% limit. With many parents choosing not to vaccinate and state accountability for vaccinatio n low, many areas with large clusters of unvaccinated children may have rates even lower th an the 92% limit. Overall, those individuals, including immune suppressed individuals, dependi ng on the herd immunity may not be able to depend on the herd immunity in the near future. Cost attributed epidemics An additional dilemma attributable to the incr ease in US epidemics is the cost involved in hospitalization and quarantines. An example of this was the 2005 measles outbreak in Indiana which cost the state $167,685; this charge does not include medical expenditure associated with treatments. The entire epidemic was the result of a total of 34 individual s with only two of the cases due to vaccine failure. Overall, 64% of th e total unvaccinated indi viduals who attended the event and came in contact with the virus became infected with measles (Parker, Staggs, Dayan, et al., 2006 ). Currently the number of uninsured childre n without vaccinati ons is unknown, but the potential medical cost for treating many of th ese preventable diseases is quite high due to many of these diseases being attributed to vira l infections which cannot be treated with one 15 specific treatment. As in the case of the Indiana outbreak, local hospitals are forced to sustain large financial cost to contain individuals with these diseases from infecting other susceptible patients. Also there is the potential for in surance companies to eliminate or reduce their treatment and/or hospitalization coverage for vaccine preventable childhood disease due to exemption statuses. Ultimately these outbreaks result in unnecessary fi nancial burden on the local and state health department for the inve stigation and evaluation of the outbreak. Most health departments have annual allotted funding for infectious disease cont rol. In the event of large than expected ep idemics, funding would come from ot her sources such as reducing or eliminating programs or increasing local taxes. Increasing pediatric physician dismissals Primary health care and pediatric physic ian are becoming frustrated by an increasing number of parents refusing to vaccinate. According to a 2005 study, over half (54%) of the 302 pediatricians surveyed reported encountering pare nts who refused all vaccines. In the same study 39% of the sampled pediatricians stated that th ey would refer the family to another physician mainly for a \"lack of shared goals\" and \"lack of trust\" (Flanagan-Klygi s, Sharp, Frader, p. 931). One of the major concerns is that dismissed pa rents may leave the traditional medical community permanently and seek healthcare from alternativ e medical sources (chiropractors, etc.) (Gellin, 2000). Increasing distrust in traditional medical systems and dismissal from practices may lead parents to permanently seek healthcare from ot her sources. Without children being seen by a pediatrician on a regular basis, these childre n may be more vulnerable to spreading and contracting childhood diseases into the general population. Also lack of traditional medical treatments and diagnosis in the early stages of disease could lead to more severe symptoms among unvaccinated children. 16 Historical and present vi ewpoint of nonvaccinators Ever since the development of the small pox vaccine by Edward Jenner in the early 1800s, individuals have radically opposed v accination (Wolfe, 2002). Although vaccinations were still in their developing st ages, the success and improvement s observed by the public health community encouraged the enforcement of mandat ory vaccinations in vari ous industrial nations through out the 19th century. Lagging behind its European counterparts by approximately eight years, the United States did not experience a large anti-vaccine moveme nt until 1878 (Blume, 2006). One of the main reasons for the delay in American reaction was due to the prevalent use of smallpox vaccination during the first part of the century which contained the smallpox epidemic. Unfortunately with th e decrease in the small pox epidemic, the use of vaccinations also diminished. A smallpox epidemic duri ng the 1870s showed the vulnerability of the population due to the lack of state enforcement of vaccinations laws and the need to develop new legislation (Wolfe, 2002). In 1879 the Anti-vaccination Socie ty of America was founded following the New York visit of William Tebb, \"the leading British an ti-vaccinationist\" (Wolfe and Sharp, 2002, p. 432). During the following years of 1882 and 1885 the New England Anti-compulsory Vaccination League and the Anti-vaccination League of New York City respectively were founded in the United States. These organizations instigated persistent conflict w ith public health authorities in the courts and through riots in Montreal and Mi lwaukee. This movement was successful in repealing mandatory vaccination laws in Californi a, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Utah, West Virginia, and Wisconsin (Wolfe, 2002). One of the key objectives of this opposition was to influence or repeal the public health legislation. This move ment was different from their European counterparts who consisted of cleric s and other individuals opposing the vaccination 17 on individual liberties issues (Blume, 2006). Many of the leaders of these American organizations were \"irregular physicians' (inc luding homeopaths)\". These individuals were threatened economically due to possible state re gulations of healthcare. Other leaders in the interest group were the manufact ures of patent medicine that would also be impacted by state regulations. With the improvement of medical practice through rigid me dical licensure laws reducing \"irregular physicians\", increased control of the state and federal governments over public health, and fewer vaccination accidents the American anti-v accination movement subsided (Allen, 2007, p. 104). The subsiding of th e movement can also be attributed to the 1898 removal of penalties and permitted exemptions for anti-vaccination pare nts through a conscience clause. (Wood-Harper, 2005) Similar legislat ion was not passed in the United Kingdom until 1907. (Blume, 2006) Throughout the early 20 th century vaccine development began to thrive and various vaccinations were introduced to the public. W ith the new development of vaccinations there were also severe health side effects and sometimes death. In 1901 scientist and medical professional began to observe tetanus outbreak s among children receiving the smallpox vaccine. Later most of these deaths were attributed to the contamination of the vaccine with tetanus bacilli. Ultimately these medical catastrophes lead to the initial steps to developing the United States food and drug regulation system. Although in 1902 a full investigation was conducted into the vaccine safety, four years la ter the anti-vaccine movement be gan to receive the funding they needed to further their cause(s) through John P itcairn, a Scottish immigrant and millionaire in the steel and oil industry. Mr. Pitcai rn's oldest son had experienced blood poisoning in 1885 as an infant due to the smallpox vaccine. With the fu nding provided the anti-vaccine movement began 18 to boom. One of the main arguments presented during this movement can be observed in the present arguments presented by alternative medicine systems, \"The opponents of vaccination emphasized indivi dual responsibility and control of one's own body. Healthy people didn't get smallpox, they said- a state of 'perfect health... resists and repels the assaults of all morbific influences.' This was a circular argument, since falling sick was always proof of one 's imperfect state of health\" (Allen, 2007, p.104). One of the remarkable aspects of the anti-vaccine movement is the remarkable consistency in the argument from the late 19th century to the current 21th centur y, even though such though has not been established or proven (Wolfe, 2002). By 1947 during the final outbreak of small pox, many of the initial crusades of the anti-vaccinati on movement observed in the early 1920's had been reduced immensely. This change in perspectives appears to be attr ibute to four main reasons: (1) Public health official began to use persuasi on techniques instead of compulsory methods, (2) Individuals had seen the health benefits of v accinations; (3) vaccine safety had improved from the earlier error of the smallpox vaccinations (Colgrove, 2006); (4) increased association between patriotism with public health duri ng World War I which encouraged respect for government mandates (Allen, 2007). Although va ccinations observed a turbulent beginning during the early twentieth centur y, it was the scientist who argue d for vaccine safety throughout that era. In the late 1970s and early 1980s a ne w rise in the anti-vac cination movement would begin to question vaccine safety even though vaccine s were safer than they had ever been before (Allen, 2007). A rise in anti-vaccine movement would r eemerge during the late 1970's and early 1980's in America. One of the key instigators of this movement was the April 19, 1982 airing of DPT: 19 Vaccine Roulette by the NBC-TV affiliate in Washington, D.C. (Allen, 2007). Within a matter of weeks, parents through out the United States we re swamped their pediatricians office with serious concerns over the Dyptheria, Tentanus, and Pertussius (DTP) vaccination due to the sensational television airing. (Col grove, 2006) Due to this rise in vaccine safety concerns a parent advocacy group was establis hed, Dissatisfied Parents Togeth er (DPT): some of the key objectives of the organization were to produce \"s afer vaccines, better medical education on the risks of vaccinations, and parental rights to de cided whether to vaccinate their children.\" (Allen, 2007, p. 254 ). Through out the 1980s a rise in legal battles concerning possi ble side effects of the DTP vaccine were brought against the govern ment and manufactures of vaccinations. Many manufactures began to raise considerably their pr ices for the vaccines to compensate for the legal cost. One of the most remarkable aspects of this unsettling time was the how the debate appeared to have little effect on immuni zation rates nationwide. During th e 1970's debate in Great Britain over the DTP vaccination, almost immediately pare nts began to not immunize their children for Pertussis which lead to an outbreak of the di sease (Colgrove, 2006). Over the next few years various studies were conducted to test the hypothesis of a cau sal association between DTP and various neurological disorders alle gedly attributed to the vaccine. One of the largest studies was conducted in 1994 with a large population st udy of 218,000 children liv ing in Oregon and Washington states. From this study 424 \"confirmed cases of neurological illness were identified prospectively during a 12-month period by stat ewide active surveillance\" (Gale, 1994, p.68). Through out the study odds ratios, the ratio of the odds of one event occurring in another separate group, were statistically insignificant for an \"increased risk of onset of serious acute neurological illness in the 7 days after DTP vaccine exposure for young children\" (Gale, 1994, p. 69). Although the organizations such as Dissati sfied Parents Together maintained to be 20 concerned with vaccine safety, they were not sa tisfied with the result of the research being conducted. Although DTP vaccination has become under sc rutiny of vaccine safety, nothing would compare in the United States to the public ity involved in the MMR and possible Autism correlation. The commencement of this controvers y can be attributed to a single study published in 1998 by a collection of scientist in the United Kingdom. A total of twelve already diagnosed autistic children with severe intestinal diso rders were evaluated for a correlation between \"chronic enterocolitis and regres sive developmental disorder\" (Wakefield, 1998). Based on this study the lead researcher Andr ew Wakefield made the following claim \"that the MMR vaccine should be withdrawn (a position not held by his co -investigators in the study)\" (Jeremy Laurance (as cited in Colgove, 2006). Through out the study various methodologi cal errors can be identified: using a cross sectional study to make a correlation conclusion, extremely small sample sizes for such a generality and most importantly no control measurements. Even with such a faulty foundation, anti-vacc ination organizations clung to the new findings as support for their belief in their now beliefs of vacci nes and autism. With the turn of the 21 st century, the debate of vaccine safety has continued. Most of the debate surrounde d the growing hypothesis that MMR vaccinations were corr elated to the increase in autism cases. In 2002 a cohort study of 537,303 total children born in Denmark be tween January 1991 through December 1998 was conducted with 440,655 of the total children bein g vaccinated for MMR. The findings of the study were as follows: \"First, the risk of autism wa s similar in vaccinated and unvaccinated children, in both age-adjusted and fully adjusted analyses. S econd, there was no temporal clustering of cases of autism at any time after immunization. Third, neither autistic disorder nor other 21 autistic-spectrum disorders were associated with MMR vaccination. Furthermore, the results were derived from a nationwide c ohort study with 1480). Two years after this study, two books were published Michael Fitzpatrick's MMR and Austim: What Parents Need To Know and Richard Horton's MMR: Science and Fiction . In Horton's book, a reporter discovered information concerning Andrew Wakefield, the l ead investigator for the original 1998 study on autism, which lead The Lancet to retract the study Ileal-lymphoid- nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pe rvasive developmental disorder in children and most of the coauthors denounced the study. Mr . Wakefield had received $100,000 to conduct his autism research from the Legal Aid Board which represents parents in the UK who believe their children are damaged by vaccines. Additionally, in 1997 Mr. Wakefield had also applied for patents for his single measles shot and his al leged cure for MMR-related autism (as cited in Allen, 2007). Even with such a large volume of studies di sproving the hypothesis for a correlation or causation between the MMR vaccine and autism, many parent and organizations continue to fuel the fear. Now instead of us ing pamphlets and brochur es as a main way to circulate information, anti-vaccinationist use the internet. A review of 78 anti-vaccination websites, the most common factor was \"the inclusion of statements linking vaccinations with specific adverse reactions, especially idiopathic chronic diseases such as multiple sclerosis, autism, and diabetes\" (Zimmerman, Wolfe, Fox, Nowalk, Troy, Sharp, 2005, p. 17). Also the study found that 75 % of the websites also provid e links to other sites which contain radical vaccine safety conspiracies, resisting the \"estab lishment\", and assertions that vaccines \"provide 22 only temporary protection and ar e therefore not worth the ri sk\" (Zimmerman, Wolfe, Fox, Nowalk, Troy, Sharp, 2005, p.17). Historically three major groups of individuals have been a ssociated in developing nations with the opposition to va ccinations: religious object ors, civil liberties gr oups, and alternative medicine practitioners. Past re ligious objectors to vaccinations have been orthodox Protestants, anthroposophy and New Age followers in the Nether lands and the Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines (Streefland, Chowdhury, Ramos-Jimenez, 1999). In America, traditionally churches such as Jehovah Witnesses, Amish (Streefland, 2 001), and Christian Science Church (Christian Science, 2008) have opposed vaccinations. Pr esently many of the religious organizations originally opposed to vaccinati ons are taking a less harsh stance. One of the only mainstream religious organizations to still uphold an anti-vaccination stance is the Christian Science Church (Christian Science, 2008). Even though the Am ish church has not made a formal statement concerning vaccinations, a 2006 study found that 84% of Old Order Amish households in the study reported having vaccinated al l their children and only 8% of respondents \"attributed their children's unvaccination status to religious objectors\" (Yoder, 2006, p.1183). This change in perspective may be attributed to the Pertus sis outbreak and other epidemics of vaccine preventable diseases observed in this community during the past few years (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2006). Whereas many of the traditional objectors to v accinations appear to currently be revising their stand on vaccinations, a new movement of vaccine objectors has begun to develop in the late 20 th and present early 21st century. This fresh movement of individuals is established generally by parents opposi ng immunizations based on alle ged adverse effects and/or reservations about the constr uctive value of immunizations and not on religious beliefs 23 (Streefland, 2001). Unlike previous religious objectors, these anti-vaccination parental organizations promote their beliefs through the in ternet and other advanc e technological sources which portray a sense of legitimacy to their objections (Allen, 2007). Furthermore many of the spokespersons for anti-vaccine groups focus on information that appears to be covered up by the mainstream medical community. The majority, if not all, of the information being presented can be refuted, but this is often difficult to communi cate to a lay audience due to the epidemiological concepts or data interpretations necessary for a suitable explan ation (Leask, McIntyre, 2003). In most cases these individuals fa il to acknowledge that individual reports or st udies expressing apprehension are only the first step in determinin g if a true contributory relationship exits (Chen, DeStefano, Pless, Mootrey, Kramarz, Hibbs, 2001) . Like their predecessors before, many of those individuals upholding the anti-vaccination st ance present a sense of social pressure or discrimination towards those pare nts or individuals in their so cial groups who may choose to vaccinate their children. In addition objectors rarely discuss the number of individuals who receive the vaccine without any difficulties rather they focus on extreme cases and situations. In summary, a variety of information can be attributed to the current anti-vaccination movement. Although the extents of influence of these views and opinions are still unknown, identifying them is one of the key steps to addressing the growing m ovement. Through this literature review, the dilemmas associated with current vacc ination laws, current health outbreaks attributed to unvaccinated children, and historical influences have been discussed. Even though this movement appears to be a ne w phenomenon, it is not radically different from that of previous generation. These movements a ppear to follow a general cycle: communities oppose a vaccination(s); outbreak comes upon their community; due to deaths incurred during the outbreak regulations are enfor ced or developed to reduce the out break; with the reduction of 24 observable epidemics, individuals begin the cycl e again by opposing vaccine(s). Historically it appears that until large numbers of persons are drastically impacted through death or permanently disabled, these anti-vaccination move ments continue to flour ish without regulations or policies. One of the greatest debates currently presented to public health professionals is the balance between individual's rights and wellbeing of the community. The growing 21st century anti-vaccination movement presents a test to the process for determining mandated vaccinations and enforcement methods. 25 CHAPTER 3 METHODLOGY Published US studies from 1997-2007 were accumulated through three major database sources: PubMed, EBSCOhost , and Science Direct. The following terms were used to identify relevant information: \"anti-vaccine parents\" \" anti-immunization accinated of multiple databases from 1997-2007 yi elded a final set of 10 relevant articles. Systematic review of the articles consisted of three main criteria: (1) report results of an original qualitative or quantitative study c oncerning potential at titudes, beliefs and/or behaviors of parents towards childhood vaccinations, (2) mainta in a systematic method of identifying the sample parent's of unvaccinated children, and (3) describe the met hod used to identify unvaccinated parents. Each of the articles were evaluated for main results and then placed into a spread sheet. Themes were selected based on recurrent results found through this process. 26 CHAPTER 4 RESULTS A total of ten studies were identified betw een 1998 and 2008 based on the inclusive criteria provided. Out of these total studies, the brea kdown of individual studies is as follows: one qualitative study, two case control studies, and se ven cross-section studies (Table 1). In the quantitative studies participant numbers ranged from 642 to 151,720 and varied in their selection methods for parental sampling. Both quantitativ e and qualitative studies relied heavily (80%) on data collected through parental self report info rmation concerning their child's vacc ine status; 20% of the studies requested phys ician verification on the child's vaccine status. Most (85.7%) of the cross-sectional studies re lied on national data from the National Immunization Survey and HealthyStyles and Consumer Styles surveys conducted annually. The majority (80%) of the studies focused on national data results rather th an individual state resu lts. Each of the studies varied in the controlled confounders for the studies, but the most frequently controlled confounders were age, sex, race, education, and household income. Throughout the evaluation of ten studies (Table 2), three consistent belief/attitude themes emerged: vaccines can/could harm child (vaccine safety); children receive too many vaccinations (decrease in immunity due to clinical interventions ); vaccinations are give n to prevent diseases that are not serious (risk of disease is low). A lthough each of the studies demonstrates significant percentages of parents (6.7% to 93.4%) concerned with v accine safety, parents with unvaccinated children were found to have the high est percentages of apprehension. In addition almost half of the research studies revealed an alarming concern among parents of unvaccinated children for a potential over immunizing of ch ildren. Finally, three studies found 20.9% to 80.0% 27 of parents with unvaccinated children believe that diseases being preven ted through vaccinations are not hazardous to their child's health 28 Table 1 Summary of study characteristics Quantitative Studies Case Control Studies First author, Year, Setting Cases and controls Exposure Measure Confounders Controlled for Comments Bardenheier et al., 2004, United States, 2000-2001. Cases (1016): parents of children (ages 19- to 35 month-old) not up-to-date for 1 or more of the specified vaccines. Controls (1299): 3 control groups of parents of children (ages 19- to 35 month-old) not mutually exclusive of cases. Physician-verified vaccin ation status of not up- to-date for 1 or more of the specified vaccines. Those up-to-date for all vaccines; doses of DTP/DTaP, 3 doses of polio vaccine, 3 doses of Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine, 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine; 1 doses of varicella vaccine. Race, marital status of parent, firstborn status, maternal education, child's age, mother's age, annual family income, participation in WIC. This study may be impacted with the lack of matching cases and controls by age, education or other demographic features. Cases overall: mothers tended to have lower level of education, younger than controls, younger (20-29 years old), and lower annual income (<$20,000). Salmon et al., 2005; US states of Colorado, Massachusetts, Missouri, and Washington; February 2002 and February 2003. Cases (815): Children claiming vaccination exemption per school records for any reason including medical. Controls (1630): Fully vaccinated children per school records randomly selected from the same grade and school. Parental reports Parental Reports Respondent's age, education, and income. Study excluded children whose parents claimed their child was fully vaccinated although the school records stated an exemption and parents who provided plausible medical contradictions. Cross Sectional studies First author, Year, Setting Cohort Objectives Confounders Controlled for Comments Gellin et al., 2000, United States, April- May 1999 1600 interviews completed. 99.6 % of survey respondents were parents or legal guardians of a child 6 years of age or younger.

In that case, the estimates of the number of unvaccinated children that we report would underestim ate the true values, particularly in geographic areas in which the NIS non-response rates are high because of negative attitudes toward vaccinations and negative attitudes toward vaccination surveys.

Parents who sought medi cal attention may have only called the physician's office and still treated the children at home. Study does not account for this. Qualitative Studies First author, Year, Setting Study Type Cohort Data Analysis Findings Comments Fredrickson et al., 2004, United States, 1997-1998. Focus group 5 groups of family physicians, 5 groups of pediatricians, 6 groups of family medicine and pediatric clinic nurses who immunize children, 3 groups of public health immunization clinic nurses; 11 groups of parents and 2 groups of parents who had refused vaccines in six cities (Albuquerque; Cleveland; Shreveport, La; Rochester, NY; Santa Fe, NM; and Wichita, Kan). Themes in focus groups, ANOVA for refusal rate estimate and demographic information. Four common themes pertinent to refusal: (1) concerns and refusals, (2) sources of information that might influence refusal, (3) trusted sources of information, and (4) doctor-patient refusal communication. All participants in the refusal groups were white with variable income levels. 31 Table 2 Frequently observed beliefs, attitude s and behaviors of anti-vaccination parents. Year, first author Top findings 2000, Gellin et al., Immunization deemed ex tremely important by 86.9% respondents. If you have another child in the future, are there any immunizations that you would not want your child to have? (83.6% would n ot opt out of any vaccinations) Children should only be immunized agai nst serious diseases (39% Agree). I am concerned that my child's immune system could be weakened by too many immunizations (25% Agree). Children get more immunizations than are good for them (23% Agree) Immunizations are always prove n safe before they are approved for use (19% Disagree) Statement Immunizations \"extremely important\". Lowest rating of importance: males (81.8%), Hispanic (71. 7%), respondents 40 years of age and older (81.4%), college graduates (83.8 %), alternative medical orientation (75.5%). Whether parent would choose to opt out of any immunizations. Highest ratings: females (17.1%), white (15.8%), college graduates (16.9%), alternative medical orientation (24.9%). 2004, Bardenheier et al. Majority of respondents (>90%) in all groups believed vaccinations are important, ther e was not significant difference between cases and control parents. Case parents (unvaccinated children) gave concern for side effects [MCV/MMR 6.7%, DT P/DTaP, 5%, Hep. B 8.2%] as the top reason for not having their child vaccinated. Second was the reason for not vaccinating was that children receive too many vaccinations Heard that MCV/DTP/ Hep B caused 2004, Fredrickson et al. Two focus groups of refusers believed that breast-feeding their babies into child hood and keeping them out of day care would p rotect their children from most vaccine-preventable diseases. Parents trusted vaccine informat ion given orally by physicians and public health nurses Parents saw their children as the most important thing to them Some [ numbers not given ] (refusing to vaccinate) parents believed me dical science/pharmacology should not interfe re with nature and immunity acquired from having the disease was preferable to that acquired from vaccines. Refusing parents felt that information on childhood immunization issued by either the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) or some anti-immunization Internet sites was [sic.] likely to be biased. 2004, Smith, P., et al. Compared with fully vaccinated children, unv accinated children were significantly more likely to be non-Hisp anic white than His panic and more likely to live in a household with 4 children than in a household in which he/she was the only child. Among unvaccinated children, the proportion of boys was 57.3% and significantly exceeded that of girls by 14.6% (P=.05) Unvaccinated children tended to be disproportionately white child ren whose mother was married, had a college degree, and lived in a household with an annual income exceeding $75,000. Parent of unvaccinated children are much more concerned about vaccine safety. 2005, Gust, D., et al. Within each cluster, the greatest % of college graduates and t hose with higher education were in the Immunization Advocate clus ter (42.2%) compared to the Worried (33.3%). Regarding parent age, the Worried cluster had the highest % of parents aged 40 or over (46.7%). In the Worried cluster it is important to note that from 73.3% to 93.4% of parents reported the following safety concerns: ingr edients in vaccines are unsafe (93.3%), vaccines are not tested enough for sa fety (93.3%), children get too many vaccines during the first 2 years of life (86 .7%), vaccines are given to children to 32 prevent diseases that they are not likely to get (86.7%), vaccin es are given to children to prevent diseases that are not serio us (80.0%) and vaccinations may cause chronic disease (73.3%). 66.7% of Worried parents reported their first child had not re ceived all recommended immunizatio ns. Other categories reported b etween 3.4 and 0% of parents having not vaccinated their first child. 2005, Gust, D., et al. Parents who disagreed that they had enough in formation were more likely to feel somewh at or not confident in the safety of chil dhood immunizations (OR 5.4, 95% CI=3.3-8.9); to believe that immunizations are not important (OR=2.9, 95% CI=1.2-7.2); to disagree that they trust healthcare provider's vaccine advice (OR=5.2, 95% CI=2.2-12.9); to disagree that their child's healthcare provider is easy to talk to (OR=10.8, 95% CI =3.7-2 8.1); to report that they would not have their child immunized if it were not required by law (OR=4.2, 95% CI 2.1-8.2); to believe st ates should grant exemptions b ased on religious (OR=2.4, 95% CI=1.4-4.1) and personal beliefs (OR=2.7, not trust the government (OR=4.1, 95% CI=2.3-7.5) or the Cent ers for Disease Control and Prevention (OR=4.5, 95% CI 2.2-9.2) to es tablish policy for childhood immunizations. Pare nts who disagreed also were more likel y to believe that parents should be allowed to obtain exemptions for their child eve if it raised the risk of disease for everyone else (OR=2.2, 95% CI 1.2-3.9) . 2005 Kennedy et al. At 25%, homeschools had the largest proportion of parents who were concerned that vacc ines are given to prevent non serious ill nesses, compared to 10% and 4% of public and private school pa rents respectively (p<0.01). 25% of homeschool parents were concerned th at vaccines were given to prevent illnesses that children are unlikely to get, compa red to 13% of public and 8% of private school parents (p=0.04). 19% of homeschoolers trusted the federal gov ernment to set policy for childhood vaccines compared to 57% for public and 58% f or private school parents (p<0.01). Homeschool parents have the lowest proportion (68%) that agreed or strongly agreed in trusting the vaccine a dvice of their chil d's health care provider compared to public 88% and private sc hool parents 91% (p<0.01). Homeschool parents had the lowest proportion of respondents who would fully immunize if it were not required by law (59%), foll owed by public (77%) and private (86%) school parents (p<0.01). Home school parents had the lowest proportion (56%) who agreed or strongly agreed that they had access to enough immunization i nformation. Homeschooling parents appeared to have the most concern for vaccin e safety as well as the least belief in the importance of nec essity of vaccinations (p.279). 2005 Kennedy et al. Opposed parents were lik ely to agree that ( 1) the body can protect itself without vaccine s (24% vs. 10% of supportive parents; p_0.001) and ( 2) vaccines are not or only somewhat important to a child's hea lth (36% vs. 17% of supportive parents; p_0.001). A greater proportion of opposed parents disagreed that vaccines ar e necessary to prevent certain diseases (30% vs. 14% of suppo rtive parents; p_0.001). Opposed parents also were more likely than supportive parents to be concerned th at vaccines are given to prevent diseases that are not serious (18% vs. 6%; p_0.001), as well as diseases that children are not likely to get (22% vs. 9%; p_0.001). A greater proportion of opposed vs. supportive parents were likely to ( 1) believe that vaccines were unsafe or only somewhat safe (47% vs. 32%; p_0.001), ( 2) be not or only somewhat confident in the safety of childhood vaccines (28% vs. 15%; p_0.001), and ( 3) report concern that children get too many vaccines in their first two years of life (29% vs. 13%; p_0.001). Opposed vs. supportive parents were significantly more likely to report that their child would r eceive none or only some of the recommended childhood vaccines (10%vs. 1%; p_0.001). This study shows that a parent's opposition to compulsory vaccina tion is associated with negative attitudes and beliefs about t he safety and utility of vaccines. 2005, Salmon et al. Parents of exempt children were less likely than parents of vacc inated children to report that ch ildren benefit a moderate amou nt or great deal when fully vaccinated (47.0% vs 95.5%, resp interval [CI], 0.03-0.06) or that the community benefits a mode rate amount or great deal when a child is fully vaccinated (47.3% vs 89.6%, respectively; OR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.07-0.14). The most common reasons stated for not vacc inating related to perceived vaccine safety, including (not mutually exclusive) that the vaccines might cause harm (n=190,68.6%) and that they might overload the immune system (n=136; 49.1%).Other reas ons given for forgoing vaccination includ ed the perceptions that the child was not at risk for the disease (n=103; 37.2%), that the disease was not dangerous (n=58; 20.9%), or that vaccines might not work (n=36; 13.0%); ethical or moral issues (n=25; 9.0%);and religious be liefs (n=25; 9.0%). The ethical and moral issues included use of aborted cell lines, fetal tissue and blood, and animal 33 testing as well as oppositio n to the requirements. Parents of exempt children were less likely to report their child' s primary health care professiona l to be a physician (75.8% v s 93.9%; OR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.14- 0.30) and were more likely to report their child's primary health care professional to be a nurse practitioner (7.4% vs 2.7%;OR , 41.77; 95% CI, 12.66-137. 78) compared with the parents of vaccinated children. Parents of exempt children were more likely than parents of vaccinated children to c onsider CAM* professionals and the organiza tion Dissatisfied Parents Together as good or excellent sources for vaccine information. (CAM): chiropractor, acupuncturist, or other co mplementary/alternative medicine professional. 2006, Gust et al. Parent who sought medical attent ion for an \"AEFI\" were more likely to be white , aged 35, believe that immunizations cause minor side effects, report unwanted yet required childhood immunizations, not want a new baby to be fully immunized, report concern about imm unization safety, beli eve that immunizations are dangerous, and have a child missing one or more doses of three immunizations. 34 CHAPTER 5 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Over the past twenty-eight years parental co ncerns regarding vaccine safety have been escalating. These uncertainties with vaccine safety have begun to translate into tangible decisions for a mounting number of parents by their choice not to vaccinate their children. Many of these parents naively believe the assumption that their d ecision only impacts their individual families. In actually, public health offici als are observing the compounding c onsequences of each of these \"individual\" decisions. One of the most visible consequences is the decrease in herd immunity which protects many of the most vulnerable indi viduals in a community. Although this decrease in herd immunity can be directly attributed to this emergent movement, parents choosing not to vaccinate appear to become even more concrete in their belief even when they are presented with this scientific evidence of their decisions. Understanding the reckoning behind this deep-seated view is important for researchers attempting to develop programs to encourage vaccination coverage among these high risk populations. In this literature review of ten studies re lating to unvaccinated ch ildren based on parental choices, three emerging themes were observed: vaccines can/could harm child (vaccine safety); children receive too many vaccinations (decrease in immunity due to clinical interventions); vaccinations are given to prevent diseases that ar e not serious (risk of di sease is low). First, parental concerns over vaccine safety have b ecome a growing fear even among parents choosing to vaccinate their children. Si milar to most prescription drugs, scientists and pharmaceutical companies have attempted to reduce side effect s, but complete elimination of potential side effects is impossible. In the case of the two major vaccines of concern DTP and MMR, current 35 studies have not revealed any co rrelation between thes e vaccines and any long-term side effects (Madsen, 2002 & Gale, 1994). The la tter two beliefs, although scie ntifically unprov en, are based on the individual desire to feel security that \" if we think right, feel ri ght, eat right, and breathe right, we will never be afflicted by a terri ble disease\" (Campion, 1993, p.2). Reinforcement for this belief system is through pare ntal decisions to reduce the risk of obtaining the disease while emphasizing the potential side eff ects involved with vaccinating. This provides parents with a sense of safety, whether true or not , in their decision making process. Although these three themes appear to be si mplistic, in reality pa rental decision making towards vaccinations is quite multifaceted. Two decision models expressing this complexity can be found in the following articles: Parental Beliefs and Deci sion Making About Child and Adolescent Immunization and Parent's vaccination comprehension and decisions . The following are the figures of the models presented in these articles: Figure 1 : Factors influencing parental decisi on making about childhood immunizations (Sturm, Mays, Zimet, 2005, p. 442). Physical Environment (e.g. Incidence of VPD) Institutional (e.g. Mandates) Interface with Health Care (e.g. Provider Attitudes) Personal/Parental (e.g. Health Beliefs) Social/Environmental (e.g. Media Coverage) Parental Decision Makin g 36 Figure 2: Integrated assessment: Solid black arrows indicate links between variables described by experts; dotted black arrows indicate unmediated links mentioned by respondents; links mentioned by experts but not interviewees are not shown. (Downs, Buine de Bruin, Fischhoff, 2008 ,p. 1597) Both of these models confirm the hypothesis that parental belief and attitudes towards overall health care greatly influence behavior toward v accinations (Downs, et al., 2008 & Sturm, et al. 2005). In a 2006 study researchers found that many of the parents with unvaccinated children already utilize services from alternative medicine providers (Gust, 2003). With a rise in vaccine safety concern, many of these parents with appreh ension towards traditional medicine are appear to be the most influenced into not vaccinating their child. Since the majority of the parents making this decision do not have a medical or scientific background, they depend on 'rules of thumb' or heuristics for their vaccination decision making (P oland & Jacobson, 2001). Heuristics occurs generally when an individual is presen ted with a complicated decision; it provides a cognitive shortcut for recalling information. In some situations, the information is compressed 37 into overestimating extraordinary risks and unde restimating frequent threats. Other times a parent may defer to an omission bias which is si milar to the concept 'bet ter safe than sorry'. Some rare parents choose protected values wh ich is zero lenience for any hazard whatsoever (Strum, Mays, Zimet, 2005). Ironically the same pa rents who present many of these objections to vaccinations advocate for complementary and altern ative medicine usages even when researchers have found severe side effects related with ma ny of these procedures and medications. Various studies have found many herbal treatments are not labeled with proper warnings as to the potential toxicity of their contents and exam ples of the permanent health damages caused by these medicines have been observed all over the world. In 1992, a 5 year old boy with eczema in England was found to have received for months a potent topical steroid provided by a Chinese herbalist with out any kind of warning provide d to the parents (Ni ggemann, Gr\u00fcber, 2003). Tragically many parents are not even aware of the risk involved with alternative medicine due to the lack of media attention and proper warning labels. Nonetheless these parents continue to place their trust more in these methods than mi nimized side effects of vaccinations based on years of scientific research. Even though parental decisions towards vaccina tions appear to be complicated, one of the greatest influences in assisti ng with this decision are indi viduals who surrounding the parent. Research has shown that parents who have disc ussed vaccination information with siblings, partners, and/ or mother who are health professi onals appear more settled in their vaccination decisions (Leask, Chapman, Hawe, Burgess, 2006). These personal contacts appear to have the greatest influence on whether a parent chooses to vaccinate. One of the key reasons public health professionals may be observing th e clustering of these communities is due to this occurrence. A 38 parent's reliance on the recommendation of other pa rents can be helpful in some situations, but when that dependence leads to blind follo wing the consequences can be deadly. Although parents in the genera l population continue to vaccinate, many parent's lack exposure to anti vaccination materials. When pres ented with this information these individuals either turn to medical professionals or their social network for support. Parents, especially mothers want to be informed decision makers; medical professionals addressing both risk and benefit of vaccinations appear to have the greatest influence on parents choosing to vaccinate (Leask, Chapman, Hawe, Burgess, 2006). If parent s are allowed to maintain a simplistic or superficial understanding of vaccinations, when pr esented with harmful materials they are more likely to be persuaded into accepting the materi als (Downs, Bruine de Bruin, Fischhoff, 2008). One of the first key components to combating anti- vaccination material and agenda is to provide parents accurate information on va ccination at the primary care level. Medical professionals providing truthful information on th e risk and benefits of vaccines , appears to have the greatest influence over parental decision making. A lthough vaccination materials are important, many parents desire to be partners in the learning enterprise instead of just receptors. One suggestion is to offer community information opportunities for pa rent to engage with primary care, health promotion, and the scientific community. These di scussions appear to be more influential in presenting the different perspec tive and receiving answers from trusted sources than providing information in a medical setting (McMurra y, R., Cheater, F., Weighall, A., Nelson, C., Schweiger, M., Mukherjee, 2004). Currently there do not appear to be any sp ecific programs directed toward reducing the number of unvaccinated children although there are numerous research studies being conducted. It appears based on this limite d research that the best public health model for potentially 39 developing programs towards unvaccinated child ren is the Health Belief Model (Kennedy, 2008). In Appendix C an example of a potential rese arch intervention based on this model can be observed. With the complex nature of how parents communicate and are communicated information on vaccinations, using social network analysis could help establish a systematic method for program development as well (Wa sserman and Faust, 1994). Another important research aspect should be the apparent high levels of vaccination status among adults using complementary/alternative medicine (Stokle y, Cullen, Kennedy, Bardenheier, 2008) although the children in these populations appear to be decreasing in vaccinati on status. Potentially this could be the result of previous vaccina tions, but it appears that many of these adults are current on their vaccinations such as tetanus. Understanding at wh at age of the children the concern for vaccine side effects diminishes could provide valuable information. Even though further research will be need ed prior to developing extensive programs, there are other ways that communities and states can begin to address the problem. First, states with high numbers of unvaccinated children should reevaluate their vaccine legislation and whether their current policies encourage exempti on status. Also, potential barriers should be put into place to advice parents of the consequen ces of their decision. Based on the information above, it appears that requiring pa rents to discuss their decision with a pre-selected medical professional may be a solution. Second, governmental health professionals should set standards for determining what vaccinations will be mandated; currently there appears to be little, if any, clear standards for what constitutes mandating a vaccine. Providing these reasons to the general public and the research behind these decisions is an important method for encouraging parental involvement. Third, although many states have vacci ne registries many of these registries are unorganized and sporadically used. Mandating the us e of registries for mandated vaccines status 40 and exemption status provides a disease surveill ance system for public health providers. In areas where the surveillance reveals lo w herd immunity, these professionals are able to develop intervention plans pr ior to outbreaks. Summary of Recommendations Provide accurate information concerning v accinations at the pr imary care level. Support medical personnel who deal with immu nization issues with further educational programs concerning target messaging techniques and latest informational information. States with high umbers of unvaccinated children should reevaluate their vaccine legislation and whether their current policies encourage exemption status Governmental health professionals shoul d set standards for determining what vaccinations will be mandated. Mandate the use of vaccine registries for vaccination status and disease surveillance. Further research tailor messaging and potential impact on this population. In conclusion, during the 2008 year the anti -vaccination movement has been quite vocal in expressing their distain for vaccination. Co mbating the aggressive and sometime illogical statements from these organizations is difficult. Many individuals have lost confidence in the public health system. Regaining that trust will be difficult, but it needs to start with defining the standards for mandating vaccines. Public health pr ofessionals need to be willing to show that they are not being sold out to pharmaceutical comp anies, but rather they are truly interested in the well-being of the commun ity concerning vaccination. 41 REFERENCES Allen, A.

Sometimes the 4th or 5th dose of DTaP vaccine is followed by swelling of the entire arm or leg in which the shot was given, for 1 to 7 days (up to about 1 child in 30). Other mild problems include: Fussiness (up to about 1 child in 3) Tiredness or poor appetite (up to about 1 child in 10) Vomiting (up to about 1 child in 50) These problems generally occur 1 to 3 days after the shot. Moderate Problems (Uncommon) Seizure (jerking or staring) (about 1 child out of 14,000) Non-stop crying, for 3 hours or more ( up to about 1 child out of 1,000) High fever, 105 degrees Fahr enheit or higher (about 1 child out of 16,000) Severe Problems (Very Rare) Serious allergic reaction (less than 1 out of a million doses) Several other severe problems have been reported after DTaP vaccine. These include: Long-term seizures, coma, or lowered consciousness Permanent brain damage. These are so rare it is hard to tell if they are caused by the vaccine. Hepatitis A: Mild problems soreness where the shot was given (about 1 out of 2 adults, and up to 1 out of 6 children) 51 headache (about 1 out of 6 adults and 1 out of 25 children) loss of appetite (about 1 out of 12 children) tiredness (about 1 out of 14 adults) If these problems occur, they usually last 1 or 2 days. Severe problems Serious allergic reaction, within a few minutes to a few hours of the shot (very rare) Hepatitis B: Mild problems Soreness where the shot was given, las ting a day or two (up to 1 out of 11 children and adolescents, and about 1 out of 4 adults) Mild to moderate fever (up to 1 out of 14 children and adolescents and 1 out of 100 adults) Severe problems Serious allergic re action (very rare) Inactivated Poliovirus: In countries using IPV, no increased risk for serious adverse events has been observed. Some people who get IPV get a so re spot where the shot is given. The vaccine used today has never been known to cause any serious problems, and most people don't have any problems at all with it. IPV should not be administered to persons who have experienced a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of IPV or to streptomycin, polymyxin B, and neomycin. Measles, Mumps, and Rubella: Mild Problems Fever (up to 1 person out of 6) Mild rash (about 1 person out of 20) Swelling of glands in th e cheeks or neck (rare) If these problems occur, it is usually w ithin 7-12 days after the shot. They occur less often after the second dose. Moderate Problems Seizure (jerking or staring) caused by fever (about 1 out of 3,000 doses) Temporary pain and stiffness in the joints , mostly in teenage or adult women (up to 1 out of 4) 52 Temporary low platelet count, which can cau se a bleeding disord er (about 1 out of 30,000 doses) Severe Problems (Very Rare) Serious allergic reaction (less than 1 out of a million doses) Several other severe problems have been known to occur after a child gets MMR vaccine. But this happens so rarely, experts cannot be sure whether they are caused by the vaccine or not. These include: Deafness Long-term seizures, coma, or lowered consciousness Permanent brain damage Meningococcal Mild problems Up to about half of people who get me ningococcal vaccines have mild side effects, such as redness or pa in where the shot was given. If these problems occur, they usually la st for 1 or 2 days. They are more common after MCV4 than after MPSV4. A small percentage of people who re ceive the vaccine develop a fever. Severe problems Serious allergic reactions, within a few minutes to a few hours of the shot, are very rare. A serious nervous system disorder called Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (or GBS) has been reported among some people who rece ived MCV4. This happens so rarely that it is currently not possible to tell if the vaccine might be a factor. Even if it is, the risk is very small. 53 APPENDIX B RESOURCES FOR PARENTAL VACCINATION RESEARCH Vaccine Controversy and History Allen, A. (2007).

These children pose a threat to their own health as well as individuals surrounding them. Evaluating methods to encourage vaccinations in these communities is essen tial for reducing these increasing rates. Objective: Research childhood vaccine education interventions and mediating variables within the target population of parents of unvaccinated children. Methods: Participants will be randomly selected based on unvaccinated status of their child in the vaccination registry databases from Utah, Montana, and Oregon. Four expe rimental groups and one control group will be observed as to the varying impact s of vaccine health education materials, vaccine web education, and pediatrician counseling on vaccina tion concerns. The research is a 6 month study with a three year follows up. "}
