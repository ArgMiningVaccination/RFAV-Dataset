Our son suffered from cystic fibrosis. She continued to care for Brandyn in a more friend way after he grew up, becoming his confidant, his sounding board, his shoulder. She will forever be in our hearts and a part of our family. Brandyn lost his battle at the age of 27 in 2018. We still keep in contact with Dr. Marshall. - Dr. Marshall is probably one of the most caring people I have ever met. For the past 20 years she has helped me thrive despite my CF and I owe her so much gratitude. Along with the rest of the team she provides a great service and care to us Cf-ers always accounting for and doing her best to provide for my entire bio-psycho-social well being. A great Doctor; tough, reliable, and smart. - Dr. Susan Marshall has been monitoring the health of our daughter over the last ten years. I feel very confident in her ability to diagnose and give us good advise at every turn. Dr. Marshall is knowledgable, caring and compassionate. Hands down, she's provided the best pediatric pulmonary care that we've ever experienced. I have the greatest respect for her and would highly recommend her. - - Award Name Award Description Awarded By Award Date SEATTLE TOP DOCTOR - 2022 Seattle Magazine 2022 Stanley Stamm Role Model in Medicine Award Pediatric Housestaff, University of Washington, Seattle Children's Hospital 2013 - Manuscripts in Refereed Journals - Stanton B, Felice M, Marshall SG, Sectish TCA change in the pediatric leadership landscape Pain Med, 2011 : 121-7 - Mouradian WE, Reeves A, Kim S, Evans R, Schaad D, Marshall SG, Slayton RAn oral health curriculum for medical students at the University of Washington Acad Med, 2005 : 80434-442 - Spector ND, Cull W, Daniels SR, Gihooly J, Hall J, Horn I, Marshall SG, Schumacher DJ, Sectish TC, Stanton BFGender and Generational Influences on the Pediatric Workforce and Practice Pediatrics, 2014 : 133(6)1112-21 - Corrigan C, Desnick L, Marshall SG, Bentov N, Rosenblatt RAWhat can we learn from first-year medical students perceptions of pain in the primary care setting?
