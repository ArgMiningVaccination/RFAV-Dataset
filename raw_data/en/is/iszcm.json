Not only in the tissues that contain these dangerous substances; but also, in clearing congestion in the primary organs of elimination. The Sabre Method not only removes the toxins from the tissues, it also helps eliminate them from the body. The Sabre method utilizes an internal as well as external (transdermal) approach to resolve bioaccumulation. The program consists of two supplements, synergistically affecting the detoxification pathways. The Detoxinol cr\u00c3\u00c2\u00a8me is applied directly to the area of skin over the liver. When applied to the local tissue, Detoxinol penetrates deep into the tissue and stimulates the release of hepatic-toxins into the intestinal tract. ULTRA D, an orally ingested supplement, is formulated to bind and remove the toxins released as the result of the Detoxinol. ULTRA D also helps cleanse the blood and adipose (fat) tissue, places where toxins can be extremely difficult to remove. \u00c3\u00c2 Suggested Use The following recommendations are only a guide. For best results, rub creme thoroughly into skin and use with Sabre Sciences UltraD body detoxifier capsules.

Cruciferous vegetables, like broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, and kale, are the richest sources of glucosinolates, which are considered to be the most bioactive constituents. Glucosinolates are converted in the body to isothiocyanates after they are ingested and hydrolyzed. The isothiocyanate sulforaphane is one of the most powerful activators of phase II enzyme function in the liver, supporting toxin elimination. Sulforaphane and resveratrol promote the activity of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a transcription factor that supports the robust, long-lasting expression of numerous genes responsible for detoxification and protection against oxidative stress.Among these genes are glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase phase II enzymes, such sulfotransferases. Nrf2 also supports expression of glutathione glutamylcysteinyl ligase, which is responsible for a critical step in the biosynthesis of glutathione, a vital component of cellular antioxidant and detoxification systems. Found in virtually every cell of the body, glutathione plays essential roles in protein synthesis, synthesis and repair of DNA, enzyme function, transport, and cell maturation. Optimal levels of glutathione have been associated with physical and mental health.The highest concentration of glutathione is found in the liver, where it offers antioxidant support, protects tissue and maintains detoxification. In a randomized clinical trial, supplementation with 250 and 1,000 mg of Setria glutathione per day increased glutathione levels in the blood after one, three and six months. At six months, mean glutathione levels in the high-dose group increased 30-35% in erythrocytes, plasma and lymphocytes, and 260% in buccal cells (P<0.05). In the low-dose group, mean glutathione levels increased by 17% and 29% in blood and erythrocytes, respectively (P<0.05). Both glutathione dose groups showed support for antioxidant defenses, indicated by decreases in the oxidized-to-reduced-glutathione ratio in whole blood after six months.\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Supports detoxification and antioxidant defenses on a cellular level\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Helps maintain healthy cells and tissues\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Made with vegan ConsiderationsGluten FreeNon-GMOServing 15 mgOther Ingredients:vegetarian capsule (cellulose, water)As a dietary supplement, take 1 capsule, 1\u00e2\u20ac\"3 times daily, with meals.If you are pregnant or lactating, have any health condition or are taking any medication, consult your health professional before use.Keep out of the reach of children.Use only if safety seal is intact.

During Phase I, enzymatic chemical reactions change both exogenous substances (e.g., prescription medications and pesticides) and endogenous toxins (e.g., hormones) into more water-soluble metabolites. In Phase II detoxication, the liver conjugates to protective compounds\u2014 such as glucuronides, glutathione, sulfonates, and amino acids\u2014that make them less harmful and easier to eliminate. Developed to support healthy Phase I and II detoxication pathways in the liver, Detoxication Factors provides an expertly formulated combination of more than 30 ingredients. It can be used for everyday nutritional support, for periods of increased oxidative stress and targeted cleansing, and can be incorporated into individualized endocrine, cardiovascular, or cellular support protocols.
