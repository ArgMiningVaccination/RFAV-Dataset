Experts explain what that all means for us. It's normal for viruses to evolve into new variants and subvariants over time. Viruses \"generate a lot of change as they replicate in our body, and any changes that provide them with a benefit in terms of the ability to transmit from one person to another will stick around,\" said Dr. Catherine Blish, a professor of infectious diseases at Stanford Medicine. - - Stanford News Carolyn Bertozzi wins Nobel in chemistry Stanford chemist Carolyn Bertozzi was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry for her development of bioorthogonal reactions, which allow scientists to explore cells and track biological processes without disrupting the normal chemistry of the cell. - - Healthier, Happy Lives Blog Young Man Becomes First in World to Be Cured of FSGS With New Treatment Traejen spent hours a day on dialysis after a failed kidney transplant, until a new approach cured his FSGS and helped him get his life back. \"When I met Traejen at 19 years old, he literally told me, 'I can't keep doing dialysis.' He was very clear in his wishes. He said, 'If you can give me a chance, I am going to take that chance, even if there's a chance I might die,'\" says Alice Bertaina, MD, PhD, a stem cell transplantation specialist and Stem Cell Transplantation and Regenerative Medicine section chief for the Bass Center for Childhood Cancer and Blood Diseases. - - COVID COVID-19 virus found to cause inflammation in fat tissue The virus that causes COVID-19 can directly infect fat. This relationship means that the virus then replicates itself inside these fat cells, which then leads to inflammation in the immune cells also in the fat tissue. There are two specific cell types that are found in fat tissue \"that all of us have, whether lean or obese and that it can drive inflammation there which is certainly not something we wanted to see,\" said Dr. Catherine Blish, an immunologist and professor at Stanford University and one of the senior authors of the study. 2021 - - News Center Researcher awarded $12 million for a stem cell trial to improve outcomes of young blood cancer patients Stanford researcher Maria Grazia Roncarolo has been awarded $12 million by the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine for a trial aimed at improving the outcomes of stem cell transplants in children and young adults with blood cancers. - - News Center Tool can reveal cancer subtypes by cell communities they're found in various environments of the body EcoTyper is an algorithm that can sort out cell \"ecotypes\" \u2014 distinct multicellular communities \u2014 that exist in many different kinds of cancer. A paper describing the tool was published Sept. 30 in the journal Cell. Aaron Newman, along with assistant professor of biomedical data science Andrew Gentles, PhD, are co-senior authors of the article, which showcases EcoTyper's capabilities with an analysis of the tissue architecture in different types of solid cancer tumors. The lead authors are postdoctoral scholars Bogdan Luca, PhD, and Chlo\u00e9 Steen, PhD. A companion article, published Sept. 30 in the journal Cancer Cell, describes how EcoTyper was used to identify subtypes of lymphoma cells. Newman and Ash Alizadeh, MD, PhD, professor of oncology, are the senior authors of that paper. The lead authors are Chlo\u00e9 Steen, PhD, and Bogdan Luca, PhD. - - Healio Point-of-care manufacturing offers 'treat it when you need it' approach to CAR-T Numerous academic medical centers around the world have demonstrated the ability to develop and produce safe and effective chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies. Point-of-care manufacturing is critical for centers seeking to advance the science of adoptive cell therapies such as CAR-T. Beyond process control and speed, point-of-care cell therapy manufacturing could provide new treatment options for rare diseases that pharmaceutical companies often do not prioritize, according to Crystal L. Mackall, MD, Ernest and Amelia Gallo family professor of pediatrics and medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine and founding director of Stanford Center for Cancer Cell Therapy. - - Scope Stanford Medicine magazine: Unlocking the brain's mysteries This new issue of Stanford Medicine magazine explores scientific advances that are helping unlock the mysteries of the brain. Read \"The case of the vanishing brain tumor\": A disappearing brain tumor in a patient who was undergoing immunotherapy cancer treatments inspired neurosurgery chair Michael Lim, MD, to expand research into new immunotherapy options to specifically attack difficult-to-treat brain tumors. In \"A scientist's quest to save his son from a mystifying illness,\" excerpts from The Puzzle Solver, by Stanford Medicine science writer Tracie White with professor of genetics and of biochemistry Ron Davis, PhD, explore Davis' search for a cure for the severe chronic fatigue syndrome -- also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis -- that has left his son suffering for years from debilitating symptoms. October 7, 2021 - The Edge How can technology help you track real time data about your health and wellbeing? And why should you track anyway? In this episode, Michael Snyder, professor of genetics, talks about how tracking can help you gain deeper understanding of what is going on in your body at a physiological level. Often, illnesses begin developing in our bodies quietly, before any symptoms begin to show up. Snyder's research shows that by tracking on a regular basis, we can pre-empt diseases. Health data collection using wearable tech can help us take a proactive approach toward prevention of disease. And like they say, prevention is better than cure. - - News Center Study predicts who may benefit from CAR-T cell therapy for blood cancers CAR-T cell therapy works for many types of blood cancers, but more than half of patients relapse. A Stanford study provides a clue as to why. The researchers showed a correlation between the density of the target molecules on the cell surface and the likelihood that a patient will respond well to CAR-T cell therapy. They also devised a way to assess the function of engineered CAR-T cells before they are used in patients. Crystal Mackall, MD, the Ernest and Amelia Gallo Family Professor and a professor of pediatrics and of medicine and David Miklos, MD, PhD, professor of medicine and chief of bone marrow transplantation and cellular therapy are co-senior authors of the study, which was published online July 26 in Nature Medicine. - - The Stanford Daily Vaccine supplement can expand immune system's virus protection, Stanford research finds Certain additives can strengthen vaccines to protect the body from a broad range of viruses, researchers at the Stanford School of Medicine found in a study published in late June in Cell.

They published their results recently in ACS Central Science. - - News Center Stanford study ties milder COVID-19 symptoms to prior run-ins with other coronaviruses In COVID-19 patients whose symptoms were mild, Stanford researchers found that they were more likely than sicker patients to have signs of prior infection by similar, less virulent coronaviruses. Senior author, Mark Davis, PhD, a professor of microbiology and immunology; director of Stanford's Institute for Immunity, Transplantation and Infection; and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator and first author, postdoctoral fellow Vamsee Mallajosyula, PhD, first confirmed that some portions of SARS-CoV-2's sequence are effectively identical to analogous portions of one or more of the four widespread common-cold-causing coronavirus strains. - - CNN A scientist's quest to cure his son could help unravel the mystery of Covid-19 long haulers After his son developed a mysterious disease following a viral infection, Stanford geneticist Ron Davis dropped everything to focus on curing the illness.
