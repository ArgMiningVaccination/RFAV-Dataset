Although the FDA banned ephedra as a weight-loss supplement, it is still available under the name ma huang, a traditional Chinese medicine, and in a synthetic version. Guarana is an herb containing caffeine. Researchers tested the supplement Xenadrine RFA?which contains 25.4 mg of ephedra alkaloids and 185 mg of caffeine?and guarana?which contains 167 mg of caffeine?against a placebo in 16 healthy patients. The results showed that repeated doses of ephedra and guarana elevated ephedrine blood concentrations, increased the heart rate and blood pressure, and adversely affected glucose and potassium homeostasis.
