It is unclear whether this MS subgroup has aunique pathogenesis or reflects one extreme of a clini-cally complex disease pattern. The PROMiSe Trial wasdesigned to study this relatively uncommon diseasephenotype and determine if treatment with glatirameracetate (GA) could slow the progressive accumulation ofdisability that unfortunately characterizes most MSpatients when accumulation of disability is isolatedfrom the confounding effects of the drug on relapses.The PROMiSe Trial randomized 943 PPMS subjects totreatment with either GA or placebo at a 2:1 assignmentratio into a planned three-year double-blind trial. Theprimary efficacy endpoint was the time to confirmeddisease progression defined as a change of at least 1EDSS point sustained for 3 months for an entry EDSSof 3.0-5.0, or at least 0.5 EDSS for an entry EDSS of5.5-6.5. On November 6, 2002, the independent DataSafety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) met for their sec-ond interim analysis for safety and efficacy. This includeda preplanned principal efficacy analysis that was basedon 935 subjects with post baseline EDSS data, of whom757 had completed at least two years on study or hadterminated the study prematurely. No safety concernswere found. No treatment effect on the primary outcomemeasure was seen, nor could achievement of the originalprojected treatment effect be expected by the plannedtrial's end. Following the recommendations of theDSMC, all patients were taken off trial medication andoffered continued participation as part of a natural historyextension to capture additional information on thisunique PPMS cohort until October 2003. At that second interim analysis, 79.2% of all data expected from the planned three-year core study wereavailable. Based on detailed analysis of that dataset sev- eral early observations and tentative conclusions emergethat must be carefully considered in planning future tri-als in PPMS. Less than 4% of these to the progressive relapsing phenotype. Thosewith relapses on study were more likely to have had anenhancement on their baseline MRI; /H1101120% of subjects with attacks on trial had negative entry CSF examina-tions. The withdrawal rate was flat at 10% per annumover the first 2.5 years of the trial. Since no treatmenteffect was found on the primary outcome, all study sub-jects were analyzed as a group for those clinical and MRIfactors that might influence the time to progression. TheKaplan-Meier estimate of mean survival time, regardlessof entry EDSS stratum, was 2.3 years and a median sur-vival was never reached. The estimate of the proportionprogressed at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months was 9.8%, 19.4%,26.8%, and 32.1%, respectively. Those with higherEDSS at entry progressed faster and more frequently(Hazard ratio 1.475, 95% CI 0.73-2.97). The entry MSFCwas strongly predictive of on-trial progression rates.However, when progression was defined as a combinedendpoint of a 20% increase from baseline in either thedominant or non-dominant hand 9 Hole Peg Test orTimed 25 Foot Walk, no treatment effect could be found,and fewer subjects were observed to progress using this combined endpoint than the conventional EDSS end-point. The time from clinical diagnosis to entry had littleinfluence on progression during the trial. Laboratorymarkers that appeared to influence progression on studyincluded evidence of intrathecal synthesis of immuno-globulins, the presence of one or more enhancements onbaseline MRI and total cerebral plaque burden.

There is increased IL-12 byintracytoplasmic staining and anti-CD3 stimulation andIL-12 is increased more in progressive than relapsing-remitting disease. Increased IL-12 is linked to increasedIFN-/H9253and the interaction between T cells and APCs via CD40-CD40L interactions. There are twice as many IL-12secreting cells in the peripheral blood if there is gadolin-ium enhancement on MRI. Cyclophosphamide decreasesIL-12 in MS, which is related to clinical response to ther-apy. Furthermore, cyclophosphamide is associated witheosinophilia and immune deviation and Th3responses. Cyclophosphamide increases the percentageof CCR4 /H11001T cells that produce high levels of IL-4 and reverses the increase in percentages of IFN- /H9253producing CCR5/H11001and CXCR3 /H11001CD8 T cells. Furthermore, patients with elevated IL-12 may not respond as well to IFN- /H9252. IL- 18 levels are elevated in MS and correlate with diseaseduration in progressive MS and are also dependent onCD40-CD40L interactions. We have also recently foundincreased IL-15 in MS, which appears to be more promi-nent in the relapsing-remitting stages of MS. We found adefect in regulation of both IL-12 and IFN- /H9253by endoge- nous IL-10 in progressive MS, which could contribute tothe transition of MS from the relapsing to the progressivestage. In addition, there may be a defect in CD4 /H11001CD25/H11001 regulatory cells and CD8 /H11001regulatory cells in MS. Dendritic cells contribute to the increased Th1 milieu inprogressive MS as they are polarized in a Th1 type pat-tern. DCs from patients with secondary progressive MSexhibit an increased percentage of DCs expressing CD80,low percentage of PD-L1 expression, and an increasedpercentage of cells producing IL-12 and TNF- /H9251as com- pared to patients with relapsing remitting (RR) MS and tohealthy controls (HC). A high percentage of DCs from bothgroups of MS patients expressed CD40 as compared toHC. We studied the polarization effect of DCs frompatients with MS on naive T cells by mixed lymphocytereaction assay and found that T-cells into proinflammatory T-cells and therefore may play a key role in inducing continuouspriming of T helper type-1 autoimmune responses whilein regula tory cytokines which may explain both the exacerbations and the remissionsphenotype of this disease course of MS. IFN- /H9253levels are linked to MRI measures of disease activity and polariza- tion of dendritic cells. Th1 type chemokine receptor expression (CXCR3 and CCR5) is increased in MS and toa greater extent in progressive MS. Taken together, a pre-dominant Th1 type cytokine milieu exists in MS that islinked to clinical and MRI measures. Currently usedimmunomodulatory drugs that are effective in MS appearto act by decreasing this Th1 polarization and increasing the Th2 and Th3 (TGF- /H9252) cytokine milieu. Thus immune therapy corrects the immune dysregulation in MS thatleads to a Th1 milieu. The prominent immune dysfunc-tion in progressive MS must be reconciled with the hypothesis that MS becomes a more degenerative process and less responsive to immunomodulatory therapy inthe progressive stages.

As morepieces are added to the puzzle of CNS inflammation inthe context of neurodegenerative disorders, it becomesincreasingly evident that to describe inflammation as aunified event that is \"good\" or \"bad\" for the injurednerve is an oversimplification, because it presupposes asingle (and deleterious) process rather than a phenomenonwith diverse manifestations. In our opinion, it would bemore appropriate to view inflammation as a series of localimmune responses that are recruited to cope with thedamage in the CNS, and to view its ultimate beneficial ordestructive effect (or lack of any effect) as an outcome ofits regulation. We found that anti-myelin autoimmune T cells, with the same phenotype (Th1) and apparent specificity as thosecausing autoimmune diseases, can benefit the damagedCNS tissue associated with axonal injury (Hauben et al.,2000, 2001a, 2001b). Damaged CNS in areas that arenon-myelinated can benefit from other self-antigensresiding in the site of the lesion (Mizrahi et al., 2002).The compromise between the need for autoimmunity for protection and the risk of non-controlled autoimmunity in terms of developing autoimmune dis ease is found to be displayed by naturally occurring CD4 /H11001CD25/H11001regu- latory T cells (Kipnis et al., 2002; Schwartz and Kipnis,2002). We found that all individuals spontaneouslyevoke, as a result of CNS insult (e.g., spinal cord injury),a T cell response directed against abundant proteinsresiding in the site of the lesion (e.g., myelin proteins).Yet, the individual's genetically determined ability to regulate the post-injury immune response determineswhether the outcome will be beneficial or pathological. We have evidence showing that the autoimmune T cells home to the site of CNS damage and help local residentmicroglia remove the threat, thereby reduc ing degener- ation. We suggest that therapeutic strategies based onvaccination with weak self-reactive antigen might be theoptimal choice of obtaining the benefit of autoimmuni- ty without the risk of autoimmune disease (Fisher et al.,2001; Hauben et al., 2001a; Schwartz et al., 2003). For clinical application, the choice should be based on considerations of safety, i.e., the risk of autoimmune dis-ease or of interference with plasticity in the adult CNS(Kipnis et al., 2000; Schori et al., 2001). This therapeu-tic strategy should be viewed not simply as anotherpharmacological therapy, but as a more global approachin the sense that it allows the body to use a remedy thathas developed through evolution and not through exper-imental manipulation. Timely stimulation of a benignautoimmune response, in which T helper cells thatorchestrate processes of maintenance and repair aredirected to the site of the lesion, may thus represent apotential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of neuro-degenerative diseases.

After 10-20 years, most patients developa superimposed progressive course that is associated withgradually increasing disability between clinically evidentrelapses (Lublin and Reingold, 1996). A lthough the relapses of MS are due to focal inflammatory demyeli-nation that is associated with contrast-enhancement onMRI, most contrast-enhancing lesions are not associat-ed with relapses. Serial studies have revealed that thefrequency of contrast-enhancing lesions on cerebral MRIis roughly ten times greater than the frequency of clini-cally evident relapses. Approximately 40% of patients withMS will have a contrast-enhancing lesion on randomlyperformed MRI (Miller et al., 1998). In recent years, anumber of immunomodulatory therapies have beendeveloped that decrease the frequency of contrast-enhancing lesions by between 30 and 90%. The average MS patient with relapsing-remitting disease suffers an increase of cerebral T2-weighted lesion volumeof 5-10% per year. Immunomodulatory drugs the further accumulation of lesion volume.However, lesion volume that has accumulated prior tothe initiation of therapy mostly represents a permanent\"burden of disease\". In short term studies the relationbetween T2-weighted lesion volume and disability is notstrong. In the long term, patients who accumulate greaterlesion volumes tend to have greater disability and aremore likely to develop secondary progressive disease(Brex et al., 2002). An important insight gained in recentyears is that, in patients with secondary progressive MS,the immunomodulatory agents in common use cansuppress focal inflammatory activity without necessarilyslowing the progression of disability.The accumulation of irreversible disability in MS results primarily from irreversible neuroaxonal injury. Themechanism(s) responsible for the dissociation of focalinflammatory activity and secondary progression in MSare not well understood. Two theories are curr ently in favor. The first is that chronic demyelination makesaxons susceptible to delayed anterograde and retrograde degeneration that cannot be stopped by subsequentimmunomodulatory therapy. This mechanism couldpropagate transynaptically. Alternatively, progressioncould result from a primary degenerative process. techniques for measuring neuroaxonal integrity(magnetic imaging and \"short T2\" imaging)(Pike et al., 1999) and subtle changes in brain volumeare helping to define the relative importance of thesedifferent mechanisms (Rudick et al., 1999).

Axonal loss and neuronal dysfunctionhave several etiologies whose prevalence may varyduring the course of this disease (Trapp et al., 1999). Itis well established that axonal loss and injury begins atdisease onset and correlates with the degree of inflam-mation within demyelinating lesions (Trapp et al., 1998;Ferguson et al., 1997). Inflammatory demyelination,therefore, is a major cause of axonal loss. Most axons,however, initially survive the inflammation associatedwith demyelination. These axons retain normal functionfor variable periods of time. Chronically demyelinatedaxons, however, are \"at risk\" and many die and con-tribute to the total axonal loss. Once a threshold ofaxonal loss is reached (beyond which compensatoryCNS resources are exhausted), MS becomes a chronicprogressive disease. Demyelination and neuronalpathology also occur in the cerebral cortex of MSpatients (Peterson et al., 2001). Similar to axonal tran-section in white matter lesions, transected neurites(axons and dend rites) correlate with the degree matory activity in cortical lesions. Apoptotic neurons aresignificantly increased in cor tical lesions when compared to non-lesion cortex. Surprisingly, cortical demyelinationoccurs without significant infiltration of leukocytes bloodstream. Microglial activation, however, is aprominent feature of cortical MS lesions. We currentlyknow little about the dynamics of cortical lesion forma-tion because they are not visible on standard MRI images;cortical lesions appear to be abundant in most chronic MSpatients (Bo et al., 2003). Recent studies from our labora- tory have characterized neuronal pathologies that occur inthe motor cortex independent of cortical demyelination. These include reductions in genes essen tial for energy metabolism and inhibitory innervation of neuronalperikarya. Increased neuronal activity combined withreduced ATP production may render chronicallydemyelinated axons vulnerable to degeneration. Theconcept of MS as an inflammatory neurodegenerativedisease has important clinical implications. There is anurgent need to increase and supplement current anti-inflammatory therapies with neuroprotective therapiesthat preserve chronically demyelinated axons and MM, Perry VH.

Estrogens have neuroprotective effects invitro and in animal models of multiple sclerosis. A clin-ical trial in patients with MS demonstrated a beneficialeffect of estriol on immune markers of inflammation andon the number and volume of enhancing lesions onbrain MRI. Objectives: To determine whether treatment with the hormone estriol would have a benefit on neuronal de-generation as measured by the evolution of T1.Methods: Ten women with clinically definite MS were enrolled in a crossover trial of estriol therapy (6 relaps-ing remitting [RR] and 4 secondary progressive [SP]).Monthly enhanced brain MRI scans were done during6 months of baseline, 6 months of treatment with 8 mgof estriol per day and 6 months post-treatment.Enhancing lesion volumes were counted skull stripped, rf-corrected, intensity into a common space. Using standardthresholds, each T1 scan was tissue classified as whitematter, gray matter or CSF. Areas of low signal in thewhite matter of the T1 scans were classified as \"moderateblack holes\" \u2014segmented as gray matter or \"severe blackholes\" \u2014segmented as CSF. The rate of accumulation ofsevere black hole volume was compared during thebaseline, treatment and post-treatment periods. Acutelyenhancing lesions were excluded from the volumecalculations but were assessed over time to determinethe rate of transformation into black holes during thecourse of the study. Results: Median severe T1 black hole volume at base- line was 0.73 cc for the group, 0.49 cc in the RR groupand 1.04 cc in the SP group. The median rate of severeT1 black hole accumulation for the group during base-line was cc/month, 0.009 cc/month in the cc/month in the SP group. During thetreatment period, the rate decreased to 0.010 cc/monthfor the group, 0.003 cc/month for the RR group and0.024 cc/month in the SP group. In the post-treatmentperiod the rate increased to 0.019 cc/month overall,0.010 cc/month in the RR group and 0.033 cc/month in the SP group. None of the acutely enhancing lesionsidentified during the study evolved into severe blackholes. The beneficial effect of estriol on severe T1 blackhole accumulation was not correlated with its effect onenhancing lesion activity.Conclusions: The rate of accumulation of severe T1 black holes appeared to be slowed during a 6-monthtreatment period with estriol. There was no effect ofestriol seen on the proportion of enhancing lesions thattransformed into black holes, either severe or moderate,in this short time period. The potentially beneficialeffect of estriol on neuronal degeneration may be inde-pendent of its anti-inflammatory effects. These prelim-inary findings warrant further study in larger numbersof patients over longer time periods. Disclosures: NL Sicotte has nothing to disclose.

Peripheral blood was obtained fromrelapsing multiple sclerosis patients just prior to and atvarious times after their first intramuscular injection of30 mcg IFN-beta-1a. Plasma samples were analyzed forRANKL and OPG.Results: Ten patients with relapsing MS and five healthy controls were recruited. Significant changes inplasma OPG levels from pre-treatment levels occurredat the 8-hour and 24-hour time points in treated patientsbut not controls.The average percent decrease in OPGfrom pre-treatment levels was approximately 25% at the8-hour time point and the percent increase at 24 hourswas 43%. The dynamics of free, uncomplexed RANKLwas inversely related to the changes in OPG.Conclusions: Our results suggest that IFN-beta-1a treatment may modulate bone homeostasis via theRANK-RANKL-OPG system. Further studies of the effectsof chronic IFN-beta treatment on bone mineral densityare warranted. Disclosures: M Ramanathan has nothing to disclose.

Although antigen-specific CD8 /H11001T cells have been reported to induce the apoptosis of rodentneurons via an MHC-I mediated mechanism, neuronsoften do not express MHC-I in vivo. It is unclear whetherhuman neurons are susceptible to T cell cytotoxicitythrough bystander non-MHC or antigen-dependentmechanisms.Objectives: We determined whether activated human T cells could kill human neurons in culture andthrough what mechanisms. We investigated whetherthere was differential neurodegenerative potential ofTh1 and Th2 T cell subpopulations. We sought to definethe correlation between inflammation and neurodegen-eration in a mouse model of MS.Methods: We used a co-culture system of human neurons and T cells. T cells were activated either polyclonallythrough anti-CD3 or in an antigen-specific way for glati-ramer acetate (GA) or myelin basic protein (MBP). GA- orMBP-specific cells were further polarized into Th1 or Th2biases. Following a pre-determined period of co-culture,the number surviving was tabulated. Finally,experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis wasinduced in lumbar spinal cordswere analyzed histologically.Results: Polyclonally activated T cells first aggregated around neuronal elements and death to neurons thenoccurred. Allogeneic or syngeneic activated T cells wereequally deleterious to neurons. No cytotoxicity of T cellswas evident T CD40, but not to MHC-I with polyclonally activated T cells, antigen-specific(GA- or MBP) T cell lines could kill neurons. A mixedTh1/Th2 population induced 50% of neuronal death,which increased to 90% when T cells were polarizedalong the Th1 pathway. GA-specific Th2 cells were nottoxic to neurons. Finally, in MOG-EAE mice, a strong correlation was observed between inflammation, axon-al disruption and demyelination.Conclusions: These data demonstrate that activated human T cells can kill human neurons in vitro throughantigen- or non-antigen/MHC-dependent mechanisms;the only necessity was that the T cells were activated. Inantigen-specific conditions, Th1 cells were toxic whilethe Th2 ones were not. Our results suggest that activatedT cells can traffic into the CNS to induce the disruptionof neurons and produce neuronal death.

In MS,myelin-reactive lymphocytes are believed to con-tribute to the inflammatory attack on the centralnervous system.Objectives: Strategies designed to specifically sup- press the function of chronically activated memory Tcells without impairing the function of naive T cellsmight have value in the treatment of autoimmunediseases.Methods: Through a combination of fluorescence microscopy and patch-clamp analysis we have identifieda striking alteration in potassium channel expression in ACTRIMS 2003 \u2014 Eighth annual meeting of the Americas Committee for Research and Treatment in Multiple Sclerosis San Fancisco, California, USA October 19, 2003 Page 11terminally differentiated human CCR7-CD45RA- effector memory (TEM) lymphocytes.Results: Following activation, TEM cells expressed significantly higher levels of the voltage-gated Kv1.3channel and lower levels of the calcium-activatedIKCa1 channel than naive and central memory (TCM)cells. Upon repeated in vitro antigenic stimulationnaive cells differentiated into Kv1.3highIKCa1lowTEM cells, and the potent Kv1.3-blocking sea anemonepeptide ShK suppressed proliferation of TEM cellswithout affecting naive or TCM lymphocytes. Thus, theKv1.3highIKCa1low phenotype is a functional markerof activated TEM lymphocytes. Activated myelin-reac-tive T cells from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS)exhibited the Kv1.3highIKCa1low TEM phenotype,suggesting that they have undergone repeated stimula-tion during the course of disease. The Kv1.3high-IKCa1low phenotype was not seen in glutamic aciddecarboxylase, insulin-peptide or ovalbumin-specificand mitogen-activated T cells from MS patients, or inmyelin-specific T cells from healthy controls.Conclusions: Selective targeting of Kv1.3 in TEM cells may therefore hold therapeutic promise for thetherapy of MS and other T cell mediated autoimmunediseases. In a proof-of-concept animal study ShKcould both prevent and treat experimental autoim-mune encephalomylitis in Lewis rats induced by aMBP-specific TEM T cell line.

The mechanisms ofdemyelination therefore may be fundamentally differentin different disease subgroups. Critics argue that theseobservations are based largely on biopsied material andreflect atypical or severe disease and are not generalizableto prototypic MS.Objectives: To describe the clinical course of the biopsy cohort, compare with the Olmsted County MS histopathology with EDSS anddisease duration.Methods: The biopsy cohort consists of 76 patients with pathologically confirmed inflammatory demyelinatingdisease while the prevalence cohort consisted of 218patients with definite (201) or probable (17) MS. Follow-up and EDSS scores were ascertained for all biopsied/prevalence patients by interview and examination(82%/89%), telephone interview (3%/7%), and (15%/4%). EDSS for the cohort wasplotted against EDSS for the prevalence cohort matchedfor gender and disease duration. Disability for patientswith disease duration less than 15 years was compared between the two cohorts. Pathology was correlatedwith EDSS/disease duration at death or last follow-up. ACTRIMS 2003 \u2014 Eighth annual meeting of the Americas Committee for Research and Treatment in Multiple Sclerosis San Fancisco, California, USA October 19, 2003 Page 12Results: In the biopsied cohort, 63 (83%) had definite MS, 5 (7%) had probable MS, and 8 (10%) had an isolat-ed demyelinating syndrome at last follow-up. Female tomale ratio was 1:1, with an average age at onset of 38(range 9-70 years). Clinical course of definite/probablebiopsied follow-up (mean 7 years from onset) medianEDSS was 3.0 (range 0-10). Three (4%) patients diedwithin 2 years of disease onset. The clinical course inthe prevalence cohort was 141 (65%) RRMS, 62 (28%)SPMS, and 15 (7%) PPMS. At last follow-up (mean 21years from onset) mean EDSS was 3.0 (range 0-9.5). TheEDSS was similar between the two cohorts whenmatched for gender and disease duration. Comparisonof the biopsy and prevalence cohort with duration ofdisease /H1102115 years was similar for both disability at last follow-up (median EDSS of 3.0 vs. 2.0) and duration offollow-up (6 vs. 8 years). Pathological classification of the biopsy cohort revealed 11 pattern I, 35 pattern II, 11pattern III, and 19 inactive or remyelinated lesions, a fre-quency similar to published studies. All lesion patternswere distributed throughout all clinical profiles whenexamined in relation to EDSS at last follow-up and dis-ease duration. Conclusions: Most biopsy-proven MS patients have a clinical course and disability that is not markedly differ-ent when compared to a population-based MS cohort.Follow-up of biopsy-proven demyelinating disease didnot reveal alternative diagnoses. These findings indicatethat the pathogenic implications of the biopsy cohortmay be extrapolated to typical MS. Disclosures: S Pittock has nothing to disclose.

Results: The frequency of the genotypes in 221 patients from Olmsted County, MN, was homozygotes. association of genotype or carrier status for the/H900432CCR5 mutation with susceptibility to MS, disease severity as analyzed using the disease severity score(ranking of EDSS/duration stratified by duration), age ofonset of MS, and disease course (bout onset versus pri-mary progressive). Stratification by gender did not yieldany additional findings. The frequency of genotypes in the 40 patients with biopsy-derived, pathologicallyconfirmed demyelinating disease and 1 (.025%) homozygote.Although limited in statistical power, we did not find anassociation between genotype or carrier status for the/H900432CCR5 mutation with immunopathological classifica- tion (type I, II, or III lesions). Conclusions: There was no association in a population- based sample of the /H900432CCR5 mutation with suscepti- bility to MS, severity of MS, age of onset, or lesion pat-tern. Although there are major differences in CCR5receptor expression in pattern II compared to pattern IIIMS lesions, this may reflect differences in the incitingpathogenic stimulus and/or inflammatory micro-environment, rather than a genetic effect related to theCCR5 gene. The analysis of DNA polymorphisms inrelation to histopathology may permit analysis of inter-mediate effects of genetic variations including tissueexpression of inflammatory markers, degree of axonalinjury, the extent of remyelination, and immunopatho-logical classification that might be more immediatelyinfluenced by polymorphisms.

By contrast, fibrin-depleted micerecovered faster than untreated mice and never relapsed.Fibrin-treated mice showed a clinical score of 0 fromday 15 until day 60 after immunization. In a rotarodbehavioral test, performed after the second relapse of theuntreated group, fibrin-depleted mice showed a 10-foldincrease of motor strength and coordination whencompared to the untreated group. Further analysis onthe immunomodulatory effects of fibrin, as well as therole of fibrin on central nervous system remyelinationwill be presented.Conclusions: These data identify fibrin as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in MS. The positiveeffects of fibrin depletion in both chronic and remitting-relapsing paralysis indicate the possibility that fibrindepletion might overcome the necessity of differenttherapies depending on the aetiology and pathogenicmanifestations of MS.

However, ifthe donor cells were first activated in vitro with MBP, they transferred EAE, suggesting that encephalitogenic T cellsremain in protected animals and are regulated.Objectives: The objective of these studies is to investi- gate how pathogenic T cells are activated and escape theinfluence of the T regulatory cell population.Methods: We cultured T cells from unresponsive immu- nized donors with MBP peptide /H11001CpG or control oligonucleotide (CO) and assayed T cell activity.Results: In the presence of CpG, but not CO, unresponsive T cells proliferated and secreted high levels of IFN-gammaand IL-6. Since CpG induces IL-12, we cultured unrespon-sive T cells with peptide /H11001IL-12 and again saw prolifera- and IFN-gamma production. was also capable ofinducing proliferation, suggesting that theunresponsive T cells were anergized. IL-6, which wassecreted by the CpG /H11001peptide activated cells, has been reported to play a role in T cell activation by blockingTreg-mediated suppression through a toll-like receptordependent pathway. However, anti IL-6 did not blockCpG driven T cell activation in our hands. There was,conversely, activation of peptide-specific T cells in thepresence of anti TGF-beta, supporting the role of a regula-tory population in the unresponsive immunized animals.Conclusions: We conclude that pathogenic T cells persist in protected rats, and can be activated by products thatstimulate the innate immune system (i.e., CpG oligo) byreleasing unresponsive cells from the anergic state.

Neuro-immunophilins are a family of proteins that bind FK506or cyclosporin A (CsA), referred to as FK506-binding-proteins (FKBP) or cyclophilins, respectively. Neuro-immunophilins are present in and neuroimmunophilin of FK506 are neuroprotective but Objectives: To assess the neuroprotective effects of neuroimmunophilin ligands in a model of multiplesclerosis (MS). Methods: We tested the effects of FK506 (0.2, 1 and 5 mg/kg), a non-immunosuppressant FK506 derivative\u2014FR131706 mg/kg), and CsA (2, 10 and 50 mg/kg) fortheir ability to treat clinical disease and inhibit tissuedamage in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis(EAE). SJL mice were immunized with pro-tein (PLP) 139-151. At the onset of paralysis (typically12-14 days after immunization), mice were randomizedinto groups: no treatment; daily injections of vehicle; anddaily injections of test drug. Mice were graded for clini-cal EAE daily. After 30-32 days of treatment, the areas ofdamaged tissue (demyelinated axons and injured axons)were determined in and CsA (50 mg/kg) signifi- cantly the severity of the initial episode ofEAE, but FK506 prevented relapses while CsA did not.FR131706 (5 had effect (5 FR131706 (5 mg/kg) and CsA (50mg/kg) significantly (p /H110210.001) reduced the extent of damage in the dorsal, lateral and ventral white matterby a mean of up 95%, 30%, nonimmunosuppressant dose of FK506 (0.2 mg/kg)also significantly (p /H110210.001) reduced the extent of damage by a mean of up to 45%. Other dosages wereineffective. In vitro, only FK506 (1 and 5 mg/kg) andCsA (10 and 50 mg/kg) inhibited the proliferation ofPLP specific T cells. Conclusions: FK506 has dramatic effects on both clini- cal and morphologic EAE, which may relate to both itsimmunosuppressive and neuroprotective effects. A non-immunosuppressant derivative (FR131706) did not alterclinical disease, indicating the importance of in- flammation to paralysis in EAE, but did significantlyprotect the spinal cord from tissue damage. FK506 andits nonimmunosuppressant derivatives may warrantinvestigation as treatments for MS. Disclosures: BG Gold has nothing to disclose.

The first step in thedevelopment of disease is thought to be activation ofspecific T cells followed by differentiation into Th1cells, which produce high levels of of Th1 cells and have been known as importantfactors regulating the induction of EAE. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the roles of IL-18 and IL-12 in potentiating encephalitogenicactivity of oligodendro-cyte glycoprotein (MOG)-35-55. Methods: For passive transfer, MOG-specific T cell lines were generated from C57BL/6 mice, stimulated withaCD3/aCD28 antibodies and in the presence or absenceof IL-12, IL-18 or the combination of both. ELISA andintracellular used to measure the levelof IFN- /H9253and TNF- /H9251. RPA was used to detect the level of mRNA for chemokine receptors. 15 or 2.5 mg 17 /H9252- estradiol pellets were used to observe the anti-inflam-matory effect of hormone therapy.Results: MOG-specific T cells stimulated with aCD3 and aCD28 in the presence of IL-12 or IL-18 alone trans-ferred only mild EAE into a low percentage of recipients.

A SINGLE AMINO ACID IN MYELIN OLIGODENDROCYTE GLYCOPROTEIN DICTATESWHETHER OR NOT EAE IS B CELL DEPENDENT NH Ruddle1and AR Oliver2 1Yale University School of Medicine, Departments of Epidemiology and Public Health and Department ofImmunobiology, New Haven, Connecticut, USA; 2Yale University School of Medicine, Epidemiology andPublic Health, New Haven, Connecticut, USA cells Background: Uncertainty exists concerning the relative roles of T cells, B cells, and cytokines in the pathogen-esis of multiple sclerosis (MS) and its murine model,experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).Different mechanisms could be involved in the variousforms of the human disease with T cells and macro-phages in some situations, and a more prominent rolefor B cells and antibody in others.Objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine the relative role of T cells and B cells in EAE induced inC57BL/6 mice by different forms of myelin oligodendro-cyte glycoprotein (MOG).Methods: were immunized with recombinant derived extracellular immunoglobulin-like domain ofrat or human MOG, their peptides or recombinantproteins differing at position 42 generated by site specificmutagenesis.Results: Mice immunized with rat MOG developed EAE resembling rodent MOG 35-55 disease in its B cell inde-pendence and predominantly mononuclear centralnervous system infiltrate. In contrast, EAE induced byhuman MOG protein was B cell dependent with anextensive polymorphonuclear leukocytic infiltrate.MOG proteins differ at several residues, includingposition 42, in which there is a serine to proline sub-stitution in human compared to rat or mouse MOG. Human MOG 35-55 was only weakly encephalitogenic,though immunogenic, inducing proliferation and IFN- /H9253 and IL-13 to 35-55, endoge-nous murine encephalitogenic peptide. A proline substi-tution in rat MOG at position 42 markedly attenuated itsencephalitogenicity, rendering it equivalent to the humanpeptide. A serine substitution at position 42 in humanMOG eliminated the B cell dependence for pathogenicity.Rat and human MOG generated equivalent antibody titersand IgG isotypes.Conclusions: Human MOG-induced antibody most likely recognizes a different conformational epitopethan does rat MOG. This epitope recognition results inan antibody that contributes to disease. Thus, EAE canresult from an encephalitogenic T cell responseinduced by rat MOG that reacts with the endogenousmouse 35-55 or from an antibody induced by humanMOG that recognizes an endogenous mouse MOG con-formational determinant. These results, which indicatethat a single amino acid change in an immunizingprotein can result in a switch in pathogenic mechanism,have profound implications for the generation of MS inout-bred human populations.

Funding: National MS Society THE THYMUS PLAYS A ROLE IN TOLERANCE IN EAE F Song, I Gienapp, T Shawler, Z Guan and CC Whitacre The Ohio State University, Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology, and Medical Genetics,Columbus, Ohio, USA ACTRIMS 2003 \u2014 Eighth annual meeting of the Americas Committee for Research and Treatment in Multiple Sclerosis San Fancisco, California, USA October 19, 2003 Page 17Keywords: MBP; regulatory majority of people ( /H1102295%) with multiple sclerosis (MS) are diagnosed after the age of20. Recently, it has been reported that tolerance can beinduced by regulatory T cells which are generated inthe thymus. We therefore hypothesized that the thy-mus may play a role in protection from MS/EAE. Theoral introduction of auto-antigen results in a state ofprofound tolerance specific for the ingested antigen,termed oral tolerance. We have reported that oraladministration of myelin basic protein (MBP) protectsand treats mice and rats with EAE. Objectives: To determine the role of the thymus induction in EAE/MS.Methods: (TCR) transgenic (Tg) mice were fed MBP orvehicle one day before immunization with MBP andadjuvants, and the mice scored daily for EAE clinicalsigns. To examine clonal deletion of autoimmune T cellsand the development of regulatory T cells in oral toler-ance, we assessed the expression of the transgenic TCR,activation markers, apoptosis, levels of CD4 /H11001CD25 using Euthymic MBP TCR Tg mice are protected when fed MBP, while adult thymectomized Tg miceare not. The thymus appears to be an important site fordeletion, since we observed a decrease in expression ofthe Tg TCR and an increase in apoptosis of Tg T cells inthe thymus after MBP feeding. Furthermore, the thymusalso is an important site for generation of regulatory Tcells. We observed an increase in CD4 /H11001CD25/H11001regulato- ry T cells in the peripheral lymph nodes one day afterMBP feeding, which coincided with elevated geneexpression for IL-4 and TGF /H9252. We found t hat only CD4/H11001CD8/H11001CD25/H11001regulatory T cells are generated in the thymus following oral MBP administration, and thatCD4/H11001CD25/H11001cells were observed in the periphery of thymectomized mice 12 hours after MBP feeding. Theproliferative response to the major MBP peptide ineuthymic MBP-fed mice is significantly lower than inthymectomized mice. Decreased T cell activation corre-lates with an increase in CD4 /H11001CD25/H11001cells in euthymic MBP-fed mice.Conclusions: The mucosal administration effect on thymic selection, thymic deletionof autoreactive T cells and generation of CD4 /H11001 CD8/H11001CD25/H11001regulatory T cells that cooperate to prevent or suppress the development of EAE.

Methods: Electrophoretic mobility gel shift assay, RT- staining andFACS analysis.Results: The presence of a functional ER was demonstrated in secondary lymphoid tissues by reduction in TNF-alphawhen estriol was added in vitro to autoantigen stimulatedimmune cells and by the binding of protein from i mmune cells to the estrogen response element. ER-alphaexpression in immune tissues was shown at the RNAlevel by nested RT-PCR and sequencing. ER-alphaexpression was shown at the protein level by probingwestern blots with either ER-alpha specific antibodiesor with ligand. Use of ER-alpha knock out mice revealedthat both the estrogen-induced disease protection andthe estrogen-induced reduction in pro-inflammatorycytokines were dependent upon ER-alpha in the proto-typic Th1 mediated autoimmune disease experimentalautoimmune encephalomyelitis.Conclusions: The finding that the estriol mediated protec- tion in EAE is dependent upon ER-alpha is central to thedesign of selective estrogen receptor modifiers which aimto target biologic responses in specific organ systems.

Such a relationship could existif similar mechanisms of immune dysregulation wereimportant in the development of both disorders, or ifsimilar autoantigens were targeted by both disorders. Wehypothesize that involvement of such mechanisms orautoantigens might lead to similar clinical symptoms andsigns and/or immunological findings in patients withboth MS and AITD. Objectives: The aim of this study is to investigate clin- ical and immunological parameters in MS patients whohave AITD. Methods: MS patients with a diagnosis of AITD were assessed with regard to times of onset of MS and AITD,lesion localization over the course of their MS, and typeof AITD. HLA-DR and DQ typing was performed foreach patient, in the thyroid glandand spinal cord. Results: Twenty-one patients with both MS and AITD, of whom 20 were female, were identified in a cohort of270 MS patients. Eight patients had hyperthyroidism,and the remainder hypothyroidism. Clinically, patientswith MS /H11001AITD developed lesions predominantly in the spinal cord (affected in 72% of the total attacks), withsome involvement of the brainstem (18%) and optic nerve (9%). HLA typing showed lower than expectedexpression (43%) of the HLA-DR2 haplotype. Elevenpatients with MS /H11001AITD who were not on any immunomodulatory agents were tested for autoreactiv-ity to 20 different myelin peptides and to CGRP in T cell proliferation assays. Responses to myelin peptideswere variable; however, 4 of 5 patients with MS /H11001 hypothyroidism made significant responses to CGRP(mean stim ulation index of 4.7 /H110061.2), whereas none of 6 patients with hyperthyroidism and none of 4 HLA-matched MS patients without thyroid disease made a sig-nificant response to CGRP (stimulation indices of 1.1 /H11006 0.2 and 1.3 /H110060.2, respectively). Conclusions: A relationship exists between localization of MS lesions in the spinal cord and the development ofAITD, and may be related to increased immunoreactivityto antigens such as CGRP that are present in both thethyroid gland and spinal cord.

In contrast, MS males showed no IFN /H9253secretion ACTRIMS 2003 \u2014 Eighth annual meeting of the Americas Committee for Research and Treatment in Multiple Sclerosis San Fancisco, California, USA October 19, 2003 Page 19to any antigen, and for TNF /H9251only 2/4 responded MBP. /H9253and TNF/H9251to /H9253and TNF /H9251responses to PLP, with 2 controls giving extremely strong responses to several myelin anti-gens. The majority of MS females had no IL-5 respons-es. In contrast, control females gave the strongest IL-5responses. In both male groups the IL-5 responses werevery low. Both female groups had very high IL-10responses to whole MBP, and 2 control females werehigh responders to PLP 40-60. In contrast, both malegroups had very low IL-10 responses, with only oneindividual in each category having higher reactivity toseveral peptides. In MS females, we observed a small,but dose-dependent suppression of CD40L co-stimulatory molecules expression on stimulated CD3/4cells by estriol. At the highest dose, progesterone wasslightly suppressive, but at low concentrations it stim-ulated CD40L expression on CD3/4 cells. Similar resultswere obtained in control females, but the suppressiveeffect of estriol was less pronounced than in MS females.The results in control males were more difficult to inter-pret due to their wide range. Interestingly, sex hormonesdid not alter CD40L expression on CD3/8 T cells, andCD3 stimulation of CD3/8 T cells did not upregulateCD40L expression. Conclusions: Th1 cytokine responses were predominant in MS females and absent in MS males. Th2 cytokineresponses were absent in MS females and low in MSmales. These results show a disease-by-gender interac-tion. IL-10 showed a gender effect, with females havinghigher IL-10 production than males. Sex hormone effectson T cell CD40L expression were heterogeneous. In gen-eral, estriol tended to suppress the expression of CD40Lon activated CD3/4 T cells, whereas progesterone, atphysiologic concentrations, tended to induce increasednumbers of activated CD3/4 cells expressing CD40L.

It is FDA-approved for B cell lymphoma therapy.We are conducting an open-label Phase II study ofrituximab as add-on therapy in 30 MS patients that,despite taking a beta-interferon or glatiramer acetate,have active clinical MS. To receive study drug, sub-jects must have at least one gadolinium-enhancinglesion on any of 3 pre-treatment brain MRIs, and musthave had at least one clinical relapse in the previous18 months, despite being on FDA-approved therapyfor MS. The primary efficacy endpoint is number ofenhancing brain MRI lesions after vs. before treat-ment. No data on the MRI endpoint will be availablewhen the abstract is presented. CSF B cell percentage,immunoglobulin concentration and number of oligo-clonal bands are assessed prior to treatment and 20weeks post-treatment. Antibody levels to myelin anti-gens are Unblindedclinical assessments of EDSS and MSFC are done. Results: At time of this submission, 6/7 MS enrolled patients have received a full course of rituximab. Onepatient developed rash, fever, and rigors; tr eatment was discontinued. All other patients completed the regimenand had total depletion of circulating B cells. For the 4 patients followed at least 8 weeks post-treatment attime of this submission, timed 25-foot walk improvedin three, and deteriorated in the fourth subject. Forthese 4 patients, EDSS scores did not change in three,and improved (5.0 A4.0) in one. CSF studies are done at weeks 0 and 24. At the time of this submis-sion, pre- and post-treatment CSF data are availablefor 3 subjects. There was no change in oligoclonalband numbers or IgG indices, 29% mean decline inCSF IgG concentration and variable effects upon IgGsynthesis rate. B cells were partially depleted fromCSF. CSF B cell numbers declined by over 90% in onepatient; in the other two patients CSF B cells werereduced 40% and 12%. Serum antibodies blinded assessment of pre-treat-ment vs. post-treatment brain MRIs, will not be avail-able until study completion. ACTRIMS 2003 \u2014 Eighth annual meeting of the Americas Committee for Research and Treatment in Multiple Sclerosis San Fancisco, California, USA October 19, 2003 Page 20Conclusions: Preliminary data from 7 subjects indicate that rituximab is safe and effective in temporarily elimi-nating circulating B cells in MS patients. Within 6 monthsof rituximab treatment, there was no decrease in serumantibodies directed against myelin oligodendrocyte glyco- protein, nor was there any major effect upon CSFimmunoglobulin parameters. Reductions in CSF B cellnumbers were observed following therapy. Disclosures: A Cross has received honoraria in the past from TEVA, Berlex Laboratories, Biogen, Pfizer, andSerono.

In particular, the myelin basic protien (MBP)is essential for CNS myelination. posttranscriptional reg-ulation in MBP expression and myelin development viaRNA-binding proteins in response to developmentalsignals.Objectives: Our research has been focused on molecular mechanisms and signalling events that control MBPexpression and myelin production by the RNA-bindingprotein QKI, an essential factor for normal myelindevelopment. QKI belongs to the protein family of SignalTransduction Activators of RNA (STARs), characteristicof interaction with both RNA and signaling molecules.Understanding the function of QKI may ultimately helpto identify novel therapeutic targets to promote myelinrepair. Methods: We used the quaking viable (qkv) mutant mice as model system to study posttranscriptional reg-ulation of MBP expression and myelination in response to signal transduction pathways. Quantitative analysisperformed in this study include RNase protection,immunoblot oligo-dendrocytes, which results in severe dysmyelination.We found that QKI selectively interacts with the 3/H11032 untranslated region of the mRNA encoding for themyelin basic protein (MBP), an essential structure com-ponent for CNS myelin. Such interaction is critical tomaintain the stability of the MBP mRNA, and is CNS myelinogenesis pro-grammed by developmental signals, tyrosine-phosphory-lation of QKI is leading to increasedRNA-binding by QKI. Consequently, MBP mRNA rapidlyaccumulated in this developmental window. DeficientQKI expression in myelin producing cells does not affectMBP transcription, yet results in a failure in MBP mRNAaccumulation in the active phase of myelination andsevere to destabilization andmislocalization of the MBP mRNA. Conclusions: Our observations suggest that QKI is a pivotal mediator for signal transduction pathways tocontrol accelerated myelinogenesis via regulating themetabolism of MBP These results revealed anovel mechanism that regulates normal myelindevelopment, and our ongoing research focuses on therole of Src-family kinases and QKI protein in myelinrepair, which may help to develop new strategies tofacilitate myelin repair in multiple sclerosis.

Inmurine EAE, activated antigen-specific T cells, as wellas other immune cells, infiltrate the CNS and secretepro-inflammatory cytokines. cytokines and /H9253), suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) are induced in T cells and macro-phages, providing negative feedback to cytokine signaltransduction pathways. It is not known if similar regula-tory mechanisms exist in astrocytes.Objectives: The goal was to determine if SOCS expression could be induced in astrocytes by inflammatory stimuli,such as conditioned medium from myelin basic pro-tein-stimulated (MBP-CM) encephalitogenic node the cytokine-inducible inflammatory mediatorsiNOS and MCP-1, which are thought to be important inthe pathogenesis of EAE, was examined.Methods: Primary cortical astrocytes were from 1-3-day-old SJL/J mice and confluent cultures were treat-ed with medium, a combination of lipopolysaccharide(LPS) and IFN- /H9253, or MBP-CM. RNA was isolated using assay. The transcripts was quantifiedrelative to the housekeeping gene GAPDH in the samesample.Results: There was constitutive expression of SOCS-3 mRNA in astrocyte cultures. When cells were stimu-lated with and IFN- /H9253, SOCS-3 was increased and SOCS-1, iNOS, and MCP-1 were induced. To a lesserextent, all of these genes were induced by treatingcells with Co-treatment of astrocytes cytokines, such as IFN- /H9253, by infiltrating inflammatory cells may activate the pro-duction of SOCS proteins in glial cells, providing apotential mechanism for limiting inflammation in theCNS.

Objectives: In this study, we investigated the molecu- lar and cellular events within oligodendrocytes duringthe progression of a demyelinating lesion to a chronicstate and determined whether chronically demyelinatedaxons could be remyelinated.Methods: To address the molecular and cellular events occurring within the oligodendroglial populations duringthe progression of a lesion to a chronic state, we usedcuprizone (bis-cyclohexanone of adult C57BL/6 mice. Upon depletion populations, adult O4 /H11001progenitors were isolated from GFP tg mice and transplanted into thechronic lesions to determine whether the chronicallydemyelinated axons could be remyelinated.Results: Although there is rapid regeneration of the mature oligodendrocyte population following an acutelesion, most of these newly regenerated cells undergoapoptosis if the mice remain on a cuprizone diet. Theoligodendrocyte progenitors also become progressivelydepleted within the lesion if mice remain on the cupri-zone diet. Interestingly, even if the mice are returned toa normal diet following 12 weeks of cuprizone treatment,remyelination and mature oligodendrocyte regenerationdoes not occur. However, if adult O4 /H11001progenitors are transplanted into the chronically demyelinated lesion ofmice treated with cuprizone for 12 weeks, mature oligo-dendrocyte regeneration and remyelination occurs afterthe mice are returned to a normal diet. ACTRIMS 2003 \u2014 Eighth annual meeting of the Americas Committee for Research and Treatment in Multiple Sclerosis San Fancisco, California, USA October 19, 2003 Page 22Conclusions: Thus, the formation of chronically demyelinated lesions induced by cuprizone appears tobe the result of oligodendrocyte depletion within thelesion and not due to the inability of the chronicallydemyelinated axons to be remyelinated.

Also unknown, are factors possibly involved inmigration of oligodendrocytes to demyelinated areas in theCNS. Existing evidence, from studies on rats, support a rolefor chemokines in oligodendrocyte proliferation and cellpositioning. Chemokines are a family of small (8-14 kDa)basic proteins, divided into four subgroups (CXC, CC,CX3C and C). Via interactions with high affinity G-protein-coupled surface receptors, chemokines have the ability toattract specific cell types, into or within tissues.Objectives: To investigate the expression of CXC chemokine receptors and their ligands in MS.Methods: Chemokine receptors were detected in MS tissue examined by western blots.Forin vitro studies, oligodendrocytes were isolated from 18-22 week human fetal spinal cords and testedfor chemokine receptor expression by IL-8, on reactive/hypertrophic astrocytes atthe edge of active MS lesions, but weakly expressed inchronic silent lesions and absent in normals and otherneurological diseases. Cultured oligodendrocytesstained constitutively for surface expression of all threechemokine We propose that expression of CXCR1, CXCR2 and CXCR3 on oligodendrocytes, respective ligands, IL-8, GRO-alpha and IP-10, may play an important role inthe migration and development of oligodendrocytes sub-sequent to damage in the CNS. These observations haverelevance to remyelination in MS. Disclosures: KM Omari has nothing to disclose.
