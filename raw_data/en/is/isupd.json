Protect our ecosystems Importing a single piece of fruit or meat into Canada can be harmful to our ecosystems. Various food, plant and animal products are restricted or prohibited entry because they can harbour invasive species, foreign animal diseases and plant pests. These things can cause irreparable harm to Canada's crops, livestock, environment, and threaten Canada's economy. Many different kinds of items can introduce foreign threats into Canada. These include things as diverse as: - food, such as raw or cooked meats, fruit/vegetables, milk - homemade articles, such as items made from plants or wood - houseplants - live animals, including pets - bait for recreational fishing - firewood - plant cuttings, seeds, bulbs - soiled hiking boots Visit [Bringing food into Canada for personal use](https://inspection.canada.ca/food-safety-for-consumers/bringing-food-into-canada-for-personal-use/eng/1389630031549/1389630282362), [Travelling with pets, food or plants](https://inspection.canada.ca/travelling-with-pets-food-or-plants/eng/1573770102207/1573770205327) and the [Maximum Quantity Limits for Personal Use Exemption](https://www.inspection.gc.ca/about-cfia/acts-and-regulations/list-of-acts-and-regulations/documents-incorporated-by-reference/personal-use-exemption/eng/1520439688578/1520439689098) for more information.

Restrictions on what items you are allowed to bring into Canada depend on the product, country of origin and province of import. These controls are set up to help keep Canada's animals, plants and natural habitats healthy and safe. Restrictions may be adjusted at any time due to emerging threats. Many goods are subject to controls under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), and others, even if not listed on the CITES Species List, may be prohibited for export by various countries. Global Affairs Canada (GAC) has also have set limits on the quantity and/or dollar value of certain food products that you can bring into Canada duty-free or that you can include in your personal exemption. For more information see [Memorandum D19-10-2, Export and Import Permits Act (Importations)](/publications/dm-md/d19/d19-10-2-eng.html). Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) also prohibits the importation of certain aquatic invasive species. These prohibitions apply whether a traveller is aware or not of transporting listed aquatic invasive species. If listed species are found, the species and the equipment they are attached to may be seized, detained, and/or ordered cleaned.
