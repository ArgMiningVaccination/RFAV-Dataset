(a) Medical assistance covers inpatient hospital services performed by hospitals holding Medicare certifications for the services performed. (b) When determining medical necessity for inpatient hospital services, the medical review agent shall follow industry standard medical necessity criteria in determining the following: (1) whether a recipient's admission is medically necessary; (2) whether the inpatient hospital services provided to the recipient were medically necessary; (3) whether the recipient's continued stay was or will be medically necessary; and (4) whether all medically necessary inpatient hospital services were provided to the recipient. The medical review agent will determine medical necessity of inpatient hospital services, including inpatient psychiatric treatment, based on a review of the patient's medical condition and records, in conjunction with industry standard evidence-based criteria to ensure consistent and optimal application of medical appropriateness criteria. Medical assistance does not cover visits to a hospital emergency room that are not for emergency and emergency poststabilization care or urgent care, and does not pay for any services provided in a hospital emergency room that are not for emergency and emergency poststabilization care or urgent care.

Medical assistance must not be used to pay the costs of nursing care provided to a patient in a swing bed as defined in section [144.562](/statutes/cite/144.562), unless (1) the facility in which the swing bed is located is eligible as a sole community provider, as defined in Code of Federal Regulations, title 42, section 412.92, or the facility is a public hospital owned by a governmental entity with 15 or fewer licensed acute care beds; (2) the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services approves the necessary state plan amendments; (3) the patient was screened as provided by law; (4) the patient no longer requires acute care services; and (5) no nursing home beds are available within 25 miles of the facility. The commissioner shall exempt a facility from compliance with the sole community provider requirement in clause (1) if, as of January 1, 2004, the facility had an agreement with the commissioner to provide medical assistance swing bed services. (b) Medical assistance also covers up to ten days of nursing care provided to a patient in a swing bed if: (1) the patient's physician, advanced practice registered nurse, or physician assistant certifies that the patient has a terminal illness or condition that is likely to result in death within 30 days and that moving the patient would not be in the best interests of the patient and patient's family; (2) no open nursing home beds are available within 25 miles of the facility; and (3) no open beds are available in any Medicare hospice program within 50 miles of the facility. The daily medical assistance payment for nursing care for the patient in the swing bed is the statewide average medical assistance skilled nursing care per diem as computed annually by the commissioner on July 1 of each year. Medical assistance covers skilled nursing facility services for individuals eligible for both medical assistance and Medicare who have waived the Medicare skilled nursing facility room and board benefit and have enrolled in the Medicare hospice program.

Sex reassignment surgery is not covered. (a) Medical assistance covers medically necessary services and consultations delivered by a health care provider through telehealth in the same manner as if the service or consultation was delivered through in-person contact. Services or consultations delivered through telehealth shall be paid at the full allowable rate.

[See Note.] (a) The commissioner, after receiving recommendations from professional physician associations, professional associations representing licensed nonphysician health care professionals, and consumer groups, shall establish a 14-member Health Services Advisory Council, which consists of 13 voting members and one nonvoting member. The Health Services Advisory Council shall advise the commissioner regarding (1) health services pertaining to the administration of health care benefits covered under Minnesota health care programs (MHCP); and (2) evidence-based decision-making and health care benefit and coverage policies for MHCP. The Health Services Advisory Council shall consider available evidence regarding quality, safety, and cost-effectiveness when advising the commissioner. The Health Services Advisory Council shall meet at least quarterly. The Health Services Advisory Council shall annually select a chair from among its members who shall work directly with the commissioner's medical director to establish the agenda for each meeting. The Health Services Advisory Council may recommend criteria for verifying centers of excellence for specific aspects of medical care where a specific set of combined services, a volume of patients necessary to maintain a high level of competency, or a specific level of technical capacity is associated with improved health outcomes.

(c) The Health Services Advisory Council may monitor and track the practice patterns of health care providers who serve MHCP recipients under fee-for-service, managed care, and county-based purchasing. The monitoring and tracking shall focus on services or specialties for which there is a high variation in utilization or quality across providers, or which are associated with high medical costs. The commissioner, based upon the findings of the Health Services Advisory Council, may notify providers whose practice patterns indicate below average quality or higher than average utilization or costs. Managed care and county-based purchasing plans shall provide the commissioner with utilization and cost data necessary to implement this paragraph, and the commissioner shall make these data available to the Health Services Advisory Council. (a) The Health Services Advisory Council consists of: (1) six voting members who are licensed physicians actively engaged in the practice of medicine in Minnesota, three of whom must represent health plans currently under contract to serve MHCP recipients; (2) two voting members who are licensed physician specialists actively practicing their specialty in Minnesota; (3) two voting members who are nonphysician health care professionals licensed or registered in their profession and actively engaged in their practice of their profession in Minnesota; (4) one voting member who is a health care or mental health professional licensed or registered in the member's profession, actively engaged in the practice of the member's profession in Minnesota, and actively engaged in the treatment of persons with mental illness; (5) two consumers who shall serve as voting members; and (6) the commissioner's medical director who shall serve as a nonvoting member. (b) Members of the Health Services Advisory Council shall not be employed by the state of Minnesota, except for the medical director. A quorum shall comprise a simple majority of the voting members. Vacant seats shall not count toward a quorum. Members shall serve staggered three-year terms, with one-third of the voting members' terms expiring annually. Members may be reappointed by the commissioner. The commissioner may require more frequent Health Services Advisory Council meetings as needed. An honorarium of $200 per meeting and reimbursement for mileage and parking shall be paid to each council member in attendance except the medical director. The Health Services Advisory Council does not expire as provided in section [15.059, subdivision 6](/statutes/cite/15.059#stat.15.059.6). Circumcision is not covered, unless the procedure is medically necessary. (a) The commissioner shall implement a program to reduce the number of elective inductions of labor prior to 39 weeks' gestation. In this subdivision, the term \"elective induction of labor\" means the use of artificial means to stimulate labor in a woman without the presence of a medical condition affecting the woman or the child that makes the onset of labor a medical necessity. The program must promote the implementation of policies within hospitals providing services to recipients of medical assistance or MinnesotaCare that prohibit the use of elective inductions prior to 39 weeks' gestation, and adherence to such policies by the attending providers. (b) For all births covered by medical assistance or MinnesotaCare on or after January 1, 2012, a payment for professional services associated with the delivery of a child in a hospital must not be made unless the provider has submitted information about the nature of the labor and delivery including any induction of labor that was performed in conjunction with that specific birth. The information must be on a form prescribed by the commissioner. (c) The requirements in paragraph (b) must not apply to deliveries performed at a hospital that has policies and processes in place that have been approved by the commissioner which prohibit elective inductions prior to 39 weeks' gestation. A process for review of hospital induction policies must be established by the commissioner and review of policies must occur at the discretion of the commissioner. The commissioner's decision to approve or rescind approval must include verification and review of items including, but not limited to: (1) policies that prohibit use of elective inductions for gestation less than 39 weeks; (2) policies that encourage providers to document and communicate with patients a final expected date of delivery by 20 weeks' gestation that includes data from ultrasound measurements as applicable; (3) policies that encourage patient education regarding elective inductions, and requires documentation of the processes used to educate patients; (4) ongoing quality improvement review as determined by the commissioner; and (5) any data that has been collected by the commissioner. (d) All hospitals must report annually to the commissioner induction information for all births that were covered by medical assistance or MinnesotaCare in a format and manner to be established by the commissioner. (e) The commissioner at any time may choose not to implement or may discontinue any or all aspects of the program if the commissioner is able to determine that hospitals representing at least 90 percent of births covered by medical assistance or MinnesotaCare have approved policies in place. (f) The commissioner of human services may discontinue the evidence-based childbirth program and shall discontinue all affiliated reporting requirements established under this subdivision once the commissioner determines that hospitals representing at least 90 percent of births covered by medical assistance or MinnesotaCare have approved policies and processes in place that prohibit elective inductions prior to 39 weeks' gestation. (a) Medical assistance covers telemonitoring services if: (1) the telemonitoring service is medically appropriate based on the recipient's medical condition or status; (2) the recipient's health care provider has identified that telemonitoring services would likely prevent the recipient's admission or readmission to a hospital, emergency room, or nursing facility; (3) the recipient is cognitively and physically capable of operating the monitoring device or equipment, or the recipient has a caregiver who is willing and able to assist with the monitoring device or equipment; and (4) the recipient resides in a setting that is suitable for telemonitoring and not in a setting that has health care staff on site. (b) For purposes of this subdivision, \"telemonitoring services\" means the remote monitoring of data related to a recipient's vital signs or biometric data by a monitoring device or equipment that transmits the data electronically to a provider for analysis. The assessment and monitoring of the health data transmitted by telemonitoring must be performed by one of the following licensed health care professionals: physician, podiatrist, registered nurse, advanced practice registered nurse, physician assistant, respiratory therapist, or licensed professional working under the supervision of a medical director. [See Note.] Medical assistance covers outpatient hospital or physician-directed clinic services. The physician-directed clinic staff shall include at least two physicians and all services shall be provided under the direct supervision of a physician. Hospital outpatient departments are subject to the same limitations and reimbursements as other enrolled vendors for all services, except initial triage, emergency services, and services not provided or immediately available in clinics, physicians' offices, or by other enrolled providers. \"Emergency services\" means those medical services required for the immediate diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions that, if not immediately diagnosed and treated, could lead to serious physical or mental disability or death or are necessary to alleviate severe pain. Neither the hospital, its employees, nor any physician or dentist, shall be liable in any action arising out of a determination not to render emergency services or care if reasonable care is exercised in determining the condition of the person, or in determining the appropriateness of the facilities, or the qualifications and availability of personnel to render these services consistent with this section. Certain surgeries require a second medical opinion to confirm the necessity of the procedure, in order for reimbursement to be made. The commissioner shall publish in the State Register a list of surgeries that require a second medical opinion and the criteria and standards for deciding whether a surgery should require a second medical opinion. The list and the criteria and standards are not subject to the requirements of sections [14.01](/statutes/cite/14.01) to [14.69](/statutes/cite/14.69).

(b) The commissioner shall reimburse CCBHCs on a per-day basis for each day that an eligible service is delivered using the CCBHC daily bundled rate system for medical assistance payments as described in paragraph (c). The commissioner shall include a quality incentive payment in the CCBHC daily bundled rate system as described in paragraph (e). There is no county share for medical assistance services when reimbursed through the CCBHC daily bundled rate system. (c) The commissioner shall ensure that the CCBHC daily bundled rate system for CCBHC payments under medical assistance meets the following requirements: (1) the CCBHC daily bundled rate shall be a provider-specific rate calculated for each CCBHC, based on the daily cost of providing CCBHC services and the total annual allowable CCBHC costs divided by the total annual number of CCBHC visits. For calculating the payment rate, total annual visits include visits covered by medical assistance and visits not covered by medical assistance. Allowable costs include but are not limited to the salaries and benefits of medical assistance providers; the cost of CCBHC services provided under section [245.735, subdivision 3](/statutes/cite/245.735#stat.245.735.3), paragraph (a), clauses (6) and (7); and other costs such as insurance or supplies needed to provide CCBHC services; (2) payment shall be limited to one payment per day per medical assistance enrollee when an eligible CCBHC service is provided. A CCBHC visit is eligible for reimbursement if at least one of the CCBHC services listed under section [245.735, subdivision 3](/statutes/cite/245.735#stat.245.735.3), paragraph (a), clause (6), is furnished to a medical assistance enrollee by a health care practitioner or licensed agency employed by or under contract with a CCBHC; (3) initial CCBHC daily bundled rates for newly certified CCBHCs under section [245.735, subdivision 3](/statutes/cite/245.735#stat.245.735.3), shall be established by the commissioner using a provider-specific rate based on the newly certified CCBHC's audited historical cost report data adjusted for the expected cost of delivering CCBHC services. Estimates are subject to review by the commissioner and must include the expected cost of providing the full scope of CCBHC services and the expected number of visits for the rate period; (4) the commissioner shall rebase CCBHC rates once every three years following the last rebasing and no less than 12 months following an initial rate or a rate change due to a change in the scope of services; (5) the commissioner shall provide for a 60-day appeals process after notice of the results of the rebasing; (6) the CCBHC daily bundled rate under this section does not apply to services rendered by CCBHCs to individuals who are dually eligible for Medicare and medical assistance when Medicare is the primary payer for the service. An entity that receives a CCBHC daily bundled rate system that overlaps with the CCBHC rate is not eligible for the CCBHC rate; (7) payments for CCBHC services to individuals enrolled in managed care shall be coordinated with the state's phase-out of CCBHC wrap payments. The commissioner shall complete the phase-out of CCBHC wrap payments within 60 days of the implementation of the CCBHC daily bundled rate system in the Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS), for CCBHCs reimbursed under this chapter, with a final settlement of payments due made payable to CCBHCs no later than 18 months thereafter; (8) the CCBHC daily bundled rate for each CCBHC shall be updated by trending each provider-specific rate by the Medicare Economic Index for primary care services. This update shall occur each year in between rebasing periods determined by the commissioner in accordance with clause (4). CCBHCs must provide data on costs and visits to the state annually using the CCBHC cost report established by the commissioner; and (9) a CCBHC may request a rate adjustment for changes in the CCBHC's scope of services when such changes are expected to result in an adjustment to the CCBHC payment rate by 2.5 percent or more. The CCBHC must provide the commissioner with information regarding the changes in the scope of services, including the estimated cost of providing the new or modified services and any projected increase or decrease in the number of visits resulting from the change. Estimated costs are subject to review by the commissioner. Rate adjustments for changes in scope shall occur no more than once per year in between rebasing periods per CCBHC and are effective on the date of the annual CCBHC rate update. (d) Managed care plans and county-based purchasing plans shall reimburse CCBHC providers at the CCBHC daily bundled rate. The commissioner shall monitor the effect of this requirement on the rate of access to the services delivered by CCBHC providers. If, for any contract year, federal approval is not received for this paragraph, the commissioner must adjust the capitation rates paid to managed care plans and county-based purchasing plans for that contract year to reflect the removal of this provision. Contracts between managed care plans and county-based purchasing plans and providers to whom this paragraph applies must allow recovery of payments from those providers if capitation rates are adjusted in accordance with this paragraph. Payment recoveries must not exceed the amount equal to any increase in rates that results from this provision. This paragraph expires if federal approval is not received for this paragraph at any time. (e) The commissioner shall implement a quality incentive payment program for CCBHCs that meets the following requirements: (1) a CCBHC shall receive a quality incentive payment upon meeting specific numeric thresholds for performance metrics established by the commissioner, in addition to payments for which the CCBHC is eligible under the CCBHC daily bundled rate system described in paragraph (c); (2) a CCBHC must be certified and enrolled as a CCBHC for the entire measurement year to be eligible for incentive payments; (3) each CCBHC shall receive written notice of the criteria that must be met in order to receive quality incentive payments at least 90 days prior to the measurement year; and (4) a CCBHC must provide the commissioner with data needed to determine incentive payment eligibility within six months following the measurement year. The commissioner shall notify CCBHC providers of their performance on the required measures and the incentive payment amount within 12 months following the measurement year. (f) All claims to managed care plans for CCBHC services as provided under this section shall be submitted directly to, and paid by, the commissioner on the dates specified no later than January 1 of the following calendar year, if: (1) one or more managed care plans does not comply with the federal requirement for payment of clean claims to CCBHCs, as defined in Code of Federal Regulations, title 42, section 447.45(b), and the managed care plan does not resolve the payment issue within 30 days of noncompliance; and (2) the total amount of clean claims not paid in accordance with federal requirements by one or more managed care plans is 50 percent of, or greater than, the total CCBHC claims eligible for payment by managed care plans. If the conditions in this paragraph are met between January 1 and June 30 of a calendar year, claims shall be submitted to and paid by the commissioner beginning on January 1 of the following year. If the conditions in this paragraph are met between July 1 and December 31 of a calendar year, claims shall be submitted to and paid by the commissioner beginning on July 1 of the following year.

Medical assistance covers home health services at a recipient's home residence or in the community where normal life activities take the recipient. Medical assistance does not cover home health services for residents of a hospital, nursing facility, or intermediate care facility, unless the commissioner of human services has authorized skilled nurse visits for less than 90 days for a resident at an intermediate care facility for persons with developmental disabilities, to prevent an admission to a hospital or nursing facility or unless a resident who is otherwise eligible is on leave from the facility and the facility either pays for the home health services or forgoes the facility per diem for the leave days that home health services are used. Home health services must be provided by a Medicare certified home health agency. All nursing and home health aide services must be provided according to sections [256B.0651](/statutes/cite/256B.0651) to [256B.0653](/statutes/cite/256B.0653). Medical assistance covers home care nursing services in a recipient's home. Recipients who are authorized to receive home care nursing services in their home may use approved hours outside of the home during hours when normal life activities take them outside of their home. To use home care nursing services at school, the recipient or responsible party must provide written authorization in the care plan identifying the chosen provider and the daily amount of services to be used at school.

[Repealed, [2007 c 133 art 2 s 13](/laws/?id=133&year=2007&type=0)] [Repealed, [1997 c 203 art 4 s 73](/laws/?id=203&year=1997&type=0)] The commissioner, after receiving recommendations from professional medical associations and professional pharmacy associations, and consumer groups shall designate a Formulary Committee to carry out duties as described in subdivisions 13 to 13g. The Formulary Committee shall be comprised of four licensed physicians actively engaged in the practice of medicine in Minnesota, one of whom must be actively engaged in the treatment of persons with mental illness; at least three licensed pharmacists actively engaged in the practice of pharmacy in Minnesota; and one consumer representative; the remainder to be made up of health care professionals who are licensed in their field and have recognized knowledge in the clinically appropriate prescribing, dispensing, and monitoring of covered outpatient drugs. Members of the Formulary Committee shall not be employed by the Department of Human Services, but the committee shall be staffed by an employee of the department who shall serve as an ex officio, nonvoting member of the committee. The department's medical director shall also serve as an ex officio, nonvoting member for the committee. Committee members shall serve three-year terms and may be reappointed by the commissioner. The Formulary Committee shall meet at least twice per year. The commissioner may require more frequent Formulary Committee meetings as needed. An honorarium of $100 per meeting and reimbursement for mileage shall be paid to each committee member in attendance. The Formulary Committee expires June 30, 2023. (a) The commissioner shall establish a drug formulary. Its establishment and publication shall not be subject to the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, but the Formulary Committee shall review and comment on the formulary contents. (b) The formulary shall not include: (1) drugs, active pharmaceutical ingredients, or products for which there is no federal funding; (2) over-the-counter drugs, except as provided in subdivision 13; (3) drugs or active pharmaceutical ingredients when used for the treatment of impotence or erectile dysfunction; (4) drugs or active pharmaceutical ingredients for which medical value has not been established; (5) drugs from manufacturers who have not signed a rebate agreement with the Department of Health and Human Services pursuant to section 1927 of title XIX of the Social Security Act; and (6) medical cannabis as defined in section [152.22, subdivision 6](/statutes/cite/152.22#stat.152.22.6). (c) If a single-source drug used by at least two percent of the fee-for-service medical assistance recipients is removed from the formulary due to the failure of the manufacturer to sign a rebate agreement with the Department of Health and Human Services, the commissioner shall notify prescribing practitioners within 30 days of receiving notification from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) that a rebate agreement was not signed. (a) The basis for determining the amount of payment shall be the lower of the ingredient costs of the drugs plus the professional dispensing fee; or the usual and customary price charged to the public. The usual and customary price means the lowest price charged by the provider to a patient who pays for the prescription by cash, check, or charge account and includes prices the pharmacy charges to a patient enrolled in a prescription savings club or prescription discount club administered by the pharmacy or pharmacy chain. The amount of payment basis must be reduced to reflect all discount amounts applied to the charge by any third-party provider/insurer agreement or contract for submitted charges to medical assistance programs. The net submitted charge may not be greater than the patient liability for the service. The professional dispensing fee shall be $10.77 for prescriptions filled with legend drugs meeting the definition of \"covered outpatient drugs\" according to United States Code, title 42, section 1396r-8(k)(2). The dispensing fee for intravenous solutions that must be compounded by the pharmacist shall be $10.77 per claim. The professional dispensing fee for prescriptions filled with over-the-counter drugs meeting the definition of covered outpatient drugs shall be $10.77 for dispensed quantities equal to or greater than the number of units contained in the manufacturer's original package. The professional dispensing fee shall be prorated based on the percentage of the package dispensed when the pharmacy dispenses a quantity less than the number of units contained in the manufacturer's original package. The pharmacy dispensing fee for prescribed over-the-counter drugs not meeting the definition of covered outpatient drugs shall be $3.65 for quantities equal to or greater than the number of units contained in the manufacturer's original package and shall be prorated based on the percentage of the package dispensed when the pharmacy dispenses a quantity less than the number of units contained in the manufacturer's original package. The National Average Drug Acquisition Cost (NADAC) shall be used to determine the ingredient cost of a drug. For drugs for which a NADAC is not reported, the commissioner shall estimate the ingredient cost at the wholesale acquisition cost minus two percent. The ingredient cost of a drug for a provider participating in the federal 340B Drug Pricing Program shall be either the 340B Drug Pricing Program ceiling price established by the Health Resources and Services Administration or NADAC, whichever is lower. Wholesale acquisition cost is defined as the manufacturer's list price for a drug or biological to wholesalers or direct purchasers in the United States, not including prompt pay or other discounts, rebates, or reductions in price, for the most recent month for which information is available, as reported in wholesale price guides or other publications of drug or biological pricing data. The maximum allowable cost of a multisource drug may be set by the commissioner and it shall be comparable to the actual acquisition cost of the drug product and no higher than the NADAC of the generic product. Establishment of the amount of payment for drugs shall not be subject to the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act. (b) Pharmacies dispensing prescriptions to residents of long-term care facilities using an automated drug distribution system meeting the requirements of section [151.58](/statutes/cite/151.58), or a packaging system meeting the packaging standards set forth in Minnesota Rules, part [6800.2700](/rules/6800.2700), that govern the return of unused drugs to the pharmacy for reuse, may employ retrospective billing for prescription drugs dispensed to long-term care facility residents. A retrospectively billing pharmacy must submit a claim only for the quantity of medication used by the enrolled recipient during the defined billing period. A retrospectively billing pharmacy must use a billing period not less than one calendar month or 30 days. (c) A pharmacy provider using packaging that meets the standards set forth in Minnesota Rules, part [6800.2700](/rules/6800.2700), is required to credit the department for the actual acquisition cost of all unused drugs that are eligible for reuse, unless the pharmacy is using retrospective billing. The commissioner may permit the drug clozapine to be dispensed in a quantity that is less than a 30-day supply. (d) If a pharmacy dispenses a multisource drug, the ingredient cost shall be the NADAC of the generic product or the maximum allowable cost established by the commissioner unless prior authorization for the brand name product has been granted according to the criteria established by the Drug Formulary Committee as required by subdivision 13f, paragraph (a), and the prescriber has indicated \"dispense as written\" on the prescription in a manner consistent with section [151.21, subdivision 2](/statutes/cite/151.21#stat.151.21.2). (e) The basis for determining the amount of payment for drugs administered in an outpatient setting shall be the lower of the usual and customary cost submitted by the provider, 106 percent of the average sales price as determined by the United States Department of Health and Human Services pursuant to title XVIII, section 1847a of the federal Social Security Act, the specialty pharmacy rate, or the maximum allowable cost set by the commissioner. If average sales price is unavailable, the amount of payment must be lower of the usual and customary cost submitted by the provider, the wholesale acquisition cost, the specialty pharmacy rate, or the maximum allowable cost set by the commissioner. The commissioner shall discount the payment rate for drugs obtained through the federal 340B Drug Pricing Program by 28.6 percent. The payment for drugs administered in an outpatient setting shall be made to the administering facility or practitioner. A retail or specialty pharmacy dispensing a drug for administration in an outpatient setting is not eligible for direct reimbursement. (f) The commissioner may establish maximum allowable cost rates for specialty pharmacy products that are lower than the ingredient cost formulas specified in paragraph (a). The commissioner may require individuals enrolled in the health care programs administered by the department to obtain specialty pharmacy products from providers with whom the commissioner has negotiated lower reimbursement rates. Specialty pharmacy products are defined as those used by a small number of recipients or recipients with complex and chronic diseases that require expensive and challenging drug regimens. Examples of these conditions include, but are not limited to: multiple sclerosis, HIV/AIDS, transplantation, hepatitis C, growth hormone deficiency, Crohn's Disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and certain forms of cancer. Specialty pharmaceutical products include injectable and infusion therapies, biotechnology drugs, antihemophilic factor products, high-cost therapies, and therapies that require complex care. The commissioner shall consult with the Formulary Committee to develop a list of specialty pharmacy products subject to maximum allowable cost reimbursement. In consulting with the Formulary Committee in developing this list, the commissioner shall take into consideration the population served by specialty pharmacy products, the current delivery system and standard of care in the state, and access to care issues. The commissioner shall have the discretion to adjust the maximum allowable cost to prevent access to care issues. (g) Home infusion therapy services provided by home infusion therapy pharmacies must be paid at rates according to subdivision 8d. (h) The commissioner shall contract with a vendor to conduct a cost of dispensing survey for all pharmacies that are physically located in the state of Minnesota that dispense outpatient drugs under medical assistance. The commissioner shall ensure that the vendor has prior experience in conducting cost of dispensing surveys. Each pharmacy enrolled with the department to dispense outpatient prescription drugs to fee-for-service members must respond to the cost of dispensing survey. The commissioner may sanction a pharmacy under section [256B.064](/statutes/cite/256B.064) for failure to respond. The commissioner shall require the vendor to measure a single statewide cost of dispensing for specialty prescription drugs and a single statewide cost of dispensing for nonspecialty prescription drugs for all responding pharmacies to measure the mean, mean weighted by total prescription volume, mean weighted by medical assistance prescription volume, median, median weighted by total prescription volume, and median weighted by total medical assistance prescription volume. The commissioner shall post a copy of the final cost of dispensing survey report on the department's website. The initial survey must be completed no later than January 1, 2021, and repeated every three years. The commissioner shall provide a summary of the results of each cost of dispensing survey and provide recommendations for any changes to the dispensing fee to the chairs and ranking members of the legislative committees with jurisdiction over medical assistance pharmacy reimbursement. (i) The commissioner shall increase the ingredient cost reimbursement calculated in paragraphs (a) and (f) by 1.8 percent for prescription and nonprescription drugs subject to the wholesale drug distributor tax under section [295.52](/statutes/cite/295.52). (a) The Formulary Committee shall review and recommend drugs which require prior authorization. The Formulary Committee shall establish general criteria to be used for the prior authorization of brand-name drugs for which generically equivalent drugs are available, but the committee is not required to review each brand-name drug for which a generically equivalent drug is available. (b) Prior authorization may be required by the commissioner before certain formulary drugs are eligible for payment. The Formulary Committee may recommend drugs for prior authorization directly to the commissioner. The commissioner may also request that the Formulary Committee review a drug for prior authorization. Before the commissioner may require prior authorization for a drug: (1) the commissioner must provide information to the Formulary Committee on the impact that placing the drug on prior authorization may have on the quality of patient care and on program costs, information regarding whether the drug is subject to clinical abuse or misuse, and relevant data from the state Medicaid program if such data is available; (2) the Formulary Committee must review the drug, taking into account medical and clinical data and the information provided by the commissioner; and (3) the Formulary Committee must hold a public forum and receive public comment for an additional 15 days. The commissioner must provide a 15-day notice period before implementing the prior authorization. (c) Except as provided in subdivision 13j, prior authorization shall not be required or utilized for any atypical antipsychotic drug prescribed for the treatment of mental illness if: (1) there is no generically equivalent drug available; and (2) the drug was initially prescribed for the recipient prior to July 1, 2003; or (3) the drug is part of the recipient's current course of treatment. This paragraph applies to any multistate preferred drug list or supplemental drug rebate program established or administered by the commissioner. Prior authorization shall automatically be granted for 60 days for brand name drugs prescribed for treatment of mental illness within 60 days of when a generically equivalent drug becomes available, provided that the brand name drug was part of the recipient's course of treatment at the time the generically equivalent drug became available. (d) The commissioner may require prior authorization for brand name drugs whenever a generically equivalent product is available, even if the prescriber specifically indicates \"dispense as written-brand necessary\" on the prescription as required by section [151.21, subdivision 2](/statutes/cite/151.21#stat.151.21.2). (e) Notwithstanding this subdivision, the commissioner may automatically require prior authorization, for a period not to exceed 180 days, for any drug that is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration on or after July 1, 2005. The 180-day period begins no later than the first day that a drug is available for shipment to pharmacies within the state. The Formulary Committee shall recommend to the commissioner general criteria to be used for the prior authorization of the drugs, but the committee is not required to review each individual drug. In order to continue prior authorizations for a drug after the 180-day period has expired, the commissioner must follow the provisions of this subdivision. (f) Prior authorization under this subdivision shall comply with section [62Q.184](/statutes/cite/62Q.184). (g) Any step therapy protocol requirements established by the commissioner must comply with section [62Q.1841](/statutes/cite/62Q.1841). (a) The commissioner shall adopt and implement a preferred drug list by January 1, 2004. The commissioner may enter into a contract with a vendor for the purpose of participating in a preferred drug list and supplemental rebate program. The commissioner shall ensure that any contract meets all federal requirements and maximizes federal financial participation. The commissioner shall publish the preferred drug list annually in the State Register and shall maintain an accurate and up-to-date list on the agency website. (b) The commissioner may add to, delete from, and otherwise modify the preferred drug list, after consulting with the Formulary Committee and appropriate medical specialists and providing public notice and the opportunity for public comment. (c) The commissioner shall adopt and administer the preferred drug list as part of the administration of the supplemental drug rebate program. Reimbursement for prescription drugs not on the preferred drug list may be subject to prior authorization. (d) For purposes of this subdivision, \"preferred drug list\" means a list of prescription drugs within designated therapeutic classes selected by the commissioner, for which prior authorization based on the identity of the drug or class is not required. (e) The commissioner shall seek any federal waivers or approvals necessary to implement this subdivision. (f) Notwithstanding paragraph (b), before the commissioner may delete a drug from the preferred drug list or modify the inclusion of a drug on the preferred drug list, the commissioner shall consider any implications that the deletion or modification may have on state public health policies or initiatives and any impact that the deletion or modification may have on increasing health disparities in the state. Prior to deleting a drug or modifying the inclusion of a drug, the commissioner shall also conduct a public hearing. The commissioner shall provide adequate notice to the public and the commissioner of health prior to the hearing that specifies the drug that the commissioner is proposing to delete or modify, any public medical or clinical analysis that the commissioner has relied on in proposing the deletion or modification, and evidence that the commissioner has evaluated the impact of the proposed deletion or modification on public health and health disparities. (a) Medical assistance covers medication therapy management services for a recipient taking prescriptions to treat or prevent one or more chronic medical conditions. For purposes of this subdivision, \"medication therapy management\" means the provision of the following pharmaceutical care services by a licensed pharmacist to optimize the therapeutic outcomes of the patient's medications: (1) performing or obtaining necessary assessments of the patient's health status; (2) formulating a medication treatment plan, which may include prescribing medications or products in accordance with section [151.37, subdivision 14](/statutes/cite/151.37#stat.151.37.14), 15, or 16; (3) monitoring and evaluating the patient's response to therapy, including safety and effectiveness; (4) performing a comprehensive medication review to identify, resolve, and prevent medication-related problems, including adverse drug events; (5) documenting the care delivered and communicating essential information to the patient's other primary care providers; (6) providing verbal education and training designed to enhance patient understanding and appropriate use of the patient's medications; (7) providing information, support services, and resources designed to enhance patient adherence with the patient's therapeutic regimens; and (8) coordinating and integrating medication therapy management services within the broader health care management services being provided to the patient. Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to expand or modify the scope of practice of the pharmacist as defined in section [151.01, subdivision 27](/statutes/cite/151.01#stat.151.01.27).

(b) Entities meeting program standards set out in rules governing family community support services as defined in section [245.4871, subdivision 17](/statutes/cite/245.4871#stat.245.4871.17), are eligible for medical assistance reimbursement for case management services for children with severe emotional disturbance when these services meet the program standards in Minnesota Rules, parts [9520.0900](/rules/9520.0900) to [9520.0926](/rules/9520.0926) and [9505.0322](/rules/9505.0322), excluding subparts 6 and 10. (c) Medical assistance and MinnesotaCare payment for mental health case management shall be made on a monthly basis. In order to receive payment for an eligible child, the provider must document at least a face-to-face contact either in person or by interactive video that meets the requirements of subdivision 20b with the child, the child's parents, or the child's legal representative. To receive payment for an eligible adult, the provider must document: (1) at least a face-to-face contact with the adult or the adult's legal representative either in person or by interactive video that meets the requirements of subdivision 20b; or (2) at least a telephone contact with the adult or the adult's legal representative and document a face-to-face contact either in person or by interactive video that meets the requirements of subdivision 20b with the adult or the adult's legal representative within the preceding two months. (d) Payment for mental health case management provided by county or state staff shall be based on the monthly rate methodology under section [256B.094, subdivision 6](/statutes/cite/256B.094#stat.256B.094.6), paragraph (b), with separate rates calculated for child welfare and mental health, and within mental health, separate rates for children and adults.

(f) Payment for mental health case management provided by vendors who contract with a county must be calculated in accordance with section [256B.076, subdivision 2](/statutes/cite/256B.076#stat.256B.076.2). Payment for mental health case management provided by vendors who contract with a Tribe must be based on a monthly rate negotiated by the Tribe. The rate must not exceed the rate charged by the vendor for the same service to other payers. If the service is provided by a team of contracted vendors, the team shall determine how to distribute the rate among its members. No reimbursement received by contracted vendors shall be returned to the county or tribe, except to reimburse the county or tribe for advance funding provided by the county or tribe to the vendor. (g) If the service is provided by a team which includes contracted vendors, tribal staff, and county or state staff, the costs for county or state staff participation in the team shall be included in the rate for county-provided services. In this case, the contracted vendor, the tribal agency, and the county may each receive separate payment for services provided by each entity in the same month. In order to prevent duplication of services, each entity must document, in the recipient's file, the need for team case management and a description of the roles of the team members.

If the service is provided by a tribal agency, the nonfederal share, if any, shall be provided by the recipient's tribe. When this service is paid by the state without a federal share through fee-for-service, 50 percent of the cost shall be provided by the recipient's county of responsibility.

The county of responsibility, as defined in sections [256G.01](/statutes/cite/256G.01) to [256G.12](/statutes/cite/256G.12), or, if applicable, the tribal agency, is responsible for any federal disallowances. The county or tribe may share this responsibility with its contracted vendors. (k) The commissioner shall set aside a portion of the federal funds earned for county expenditures under this section to repay the special revenue maximization account under section [256.01, subdivision 2](/statutes/cite/256.01#stat.256.01.2), paragraph (o). The repayment is limited to: (1) the costs of developing and implementing this section; and (2) programming the information systems. (l) Payments to counties and tribal agencies for case management expenditures under this section shall only be made from federal earnings from services provided under this section. When this service is paid by the state without a federal share through fee-for-service, 50 percent of the cost shall be provided by the state. Payments to county-contracted vendors shall include the federal earnings, the state share, and the county share. (m) Case management services under this subdivision do not include therapy, treatment, legal, or outreach services. (n) If the recipient is a resident of a nursing facility, intermediate care facility, or hospital, and the recipient's institutional care is paid by medical assistance, payment for case management services under this subdivision is limited to the lesser of: (1) the last 180 days of the recipient's residency in that facility and may not exceed more than six months in a calendar year; or (2) the limits and conditions which apply to federal Medicaid funding for this service. (o) Payment for case management services under this subdivision shall not duplicate payments made under other program authorities for the same purpose. (p) If the recipient is receiving care in a hospital, nursing facility, or residential setting licensed under chapter 245A or 245D that is staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week, mental health targeted case management services must actively support identification of community alternatives for the recipient and discharge planning. To the extent defined in the state Medicaid plan, case management service activities for persons with developmental disabilities as defined in section [256B.092](/statutes/cite/256B.092), and rules promulgated thereunder, are covered services under medical assistance. (a) Minimum required face-to-face contacts for targeted case management may be provided through interactive video if interactive video is in the best interests of the person and is deemed appropriate by the person receiving targeted case management or the person's legal guardian and the case management provider. (b) The person receiving targeted case management or the person's legal guardian has the right to choose and consent to the use of interactive video under this subdivision and has the right to refuse the use of interactive video at any time. (c) The commissioner may establish criteria that a targeted case management provider must attest to in order to demonstrate the safety or efficacy of meeting the minimum face-to-face contact requirements for targeted case management through interactive video. (d) As a condition of payment, the targeted case management provider must document the following for each occurrence of targeted case management provided by interactive video for the purpose of face-to-face contact: (1) the time the contact began and the time the contact ended, including an a.m. and p.m. designation; (2) the basis for determining that interactive video is an appropriate and effective means for contacting the person receiving targeted case management services; (3) the mode of transmission used to deliver the services and records stating that a particular mode of transmission was utilized; and (4) the location of the originating site and the distant site. (e) Interactive video must not be used to meet minimum face-to-face contact requirements for children who are in out-of-home placement or receiving case management services for child protection reasons. (f) For purposes of this subdivision, \"interactive video\" means the delivery of targeted case management services in real time through the use of two-way interactive audio and visual communication.

Medical assistance covers day treatment services as specified in sections [245.462, subdivision 8](/statutes/cite/245.462#stat.245.462.8), and [245.4871, subdivision 10](/statutes/cite/245.4871#stat.245.4871.10), that are provided under contract with the county board. The commissioner may set authorization thresholds for day treatment for adults according to subdivision 25. Medical assistance covers day treatment services for children as specified under section [256B.0943](/statutes/cite/256B.0943). Medical assistance covers any other medical or remedial care licensed and recognized under state law unless otherwise prohibited by law. The commissioner shall publish in the State Register a list of elective surgeries that require a second medical opinion before medical assistance reimbursement, and the criteria and standards for deciding whether an elective surgery should require a second medical opinion. The list and criteria and standards are not subject to the requirements of sections [14.01](/statutes/cite/14.01) to [14.69](/statutes/cite/14.69). Medical assistance covers substance use disorder treatment services according to section [254B.05, subdivision 5](/statutes/cite/254B.05#stat.254B.05.5), except for room and board. (a) The commissioner shall publish in the Minnesota health care programs provider manual and on the department's website a list of health services that require prior authorization, the criteria and standards used to select health services on the list, and the criteria and standards used to determine whether certain providers must obtain prior authorization for their services. The list of services requiring prior authorization and the criteria and standards used to formulate the list of services or the selection of providers for whom prior authorization is required are not subject to the requirements of sections [14.001](/statutes/cite/14.001) to [14.69](/statutes/cite/14.69). The commissioner's decision whether prior authorization is required for a health service or is required for a provider is not subject to administrative appeal. Use of criteria or standards to select providers for whom prior authorization is required shall not impede access to the service involved for any group of individuals with unique or special needs due to disability or functional condition. (b) The commissioner shall implement a modernized electronic system for providers to request prior authorization. The modernized electronic system must include at least the following functionalities: (1) authorizations are recipient-centric, not provider-centric; (2) adequate flexibility to support authorizations for an episode of care, continuous drug therapy, or for individual onetime services and allows an ordering and a rendering provider to both submit information into one request; (3) allows providers to review previous authorization requests and determine where a submitted request is within the authorization process; (4) supports automated workflows that allow providers to securely submit medical information that can be accessed by medical and pharmacy review vendors as well as department staff; and (5) supports development of automated clinical algorithms that can verify information and provide responses in real time. (c) The system described in paragraph (b) shall be completed by March 1, 2012. All authorization requests submitted on and after March 1, 2012, or upon completion of the modernized authorization system, whichever is later, must be submitted electronically by providers, except requests for drugs dispensed by an outpatient pharmacy, services that are provided outside of the state and surrounding local trade area, and services included on a service agreement. (a) Effective January 1, 2010, the commissioner shall require prior authorization or decision support for the ordering providers at the time the service is ordered for the following outpatient diagnostic imaging services: computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), positive emission tomography (PET), cardiac imaging, and ultrasound diagnostic imaging.

The contracting entity must incorporate clinical guidelines that are based on evidence-based medical literature, if available. By January 1, 2012, the contracting entity shall report to the commissioner the results of prior authorization or decision support. (a) Except as otherwise allowed under this subdivision or required under federal or state regulations, the commissioner must not consider a request for authorization of a service when the recipient has coverage from a third-party payer unless the provider requesting authorization has made a good faith effort to receive payment or authorization from the third-party payer. A good faith effort is established by supplying with the authorization request to the commissioner the following: (1) a determination of payment for the service from the third-party payer, a determination of authorization for the service from the third-party payer, or a verification of noncoverage of the service by the third-party payer; and (2) the information or records required by the department to document the reason for the determination or to validate noncoverage from the third-party payer. (b) A provider requesting authorization for services covered by Medicare is not required to bill Medicare before requesting authorization from the commissioner if the provider has reason to believe that a service covered by Medicare is not eligible for payment. The provider must document that, because of recent claim experiences with Medicare or because of written communication from Medicare, coverage is not available for the service. (c) Authorization is not required if a third-party payer has made payment that is equal to or greater than 60 percent of the maximum payment amount for the service allowed under medical assistance.

Covered services include occupational therapy, physical therapy, speech-language therapy, clinical psychological services, nursing services, school psychological services, school social work services, personal care assistants serving as management aides, assistive technology devices, transportation services, health assessments, and other services covered under the medical assistance state plan. Mental health services eligible for medical assistance reimbursement must be provided or coordinated through a children's mental health collaborative where a collaborative exists if the child is included in the collaborative operational target population. The provision or coordination of services does not require that the individualized education program be developed by the collaborative. The services may be provided by a Minnesota school district that is enrolled as a medical assistance provider or its subcontractor, and only if the services meet all the requirements otherwise applicable if the service had been provided by a provider other than a school district, in the following areas: medical necessity; physician's, advanced practice registered nurse's, or physician assistant's orders; documentation; personnel qualifications; and prior authorization requirements. The nonfederal share of costs for services provided under this subdivision is the responsibility of the local school district as provided in section [125A.74](/statutes/cite/125A.74). Services listed in a child's individualized education program are eligible for medical assistance reimbursement only if those services meet criteria for federal financial participation under the Medicaid program. (b) Approval of health-related services for inclusion in the individualized education program does not require prior authorization for purposes of reimbursement under this chapter.

(d) Medical assistance coverage for medically necessary services provided under other subdivisions in this section may not be denied solely on the basis that the same or similar services are covered under this subdivision. (e) The commissioner shall develop and implement package rates, bundled rates, or per diem rates for special education services under which separately covered services are grouped together and billed as a unit in order to reduce administrative complexity. (f) The commissioner shall develop a cost-based payment structure for payment of these services. Only costs reported through the designated Minnesota Department of Education data systems in distinct service categories qualify for inclusion in the cost-based payment structure. The commissioner shall reimburse claims submitted based on an interim rate, and shall settle at a final rate once the department has determined it. The commissioner shall notify the school district of the final rate. The school district has 60 days to appeal the final rate. To appeal the final rate, the school district shall file a written appeal request to the commissioner within 60 days of the date the final rate determination was mailed.

(a) Medical assistance covers services performed by a licensed physician assistant if the service is otherwise covered under this chapter as a physician service and if the service is within the scope of practice of a licensed physician assistant as defined in section [147A.09](/statutes/cite/147A.09). (b) Licensed physician assistants may bill for medication management and evaluation and management services provided to medical assistance enrollees in inpatient hospital settings, and in outpatient settings after the licensed physician assistant completes 2,000 hours of clinical experience in the evaluation and treatment of mental health, consistent with their education, training, and experience, with the exception of performing psychotherapy or diagnostic assessments. Medical assistance covers doula services provided by a certified doula as defined in section [148.995, subdivision 2](/statutes/cite/148.995#stat.148.995.2), of the mother's choice.

For FQHCs and rural health clinics that either do not apply within the time specified above or who have had essential community provider status for three years, medical assistance payments for health services provided by these entities shall be according to the same rates and conditions applicable to the same service provided by health care providers that are not FQHCs or rural health clinics. (d) Effective July 1, 1999, the provisions of paragraph (c) requiring an FQHC or a rural health clinic to make application for an essential community provider designation in order to have cost-based payments made according to paragraphs (a) and (b) no longer apply. (e) Effective January 1, 2000, payments made according to paragraphs (a) and (b) shall be limited to the cost phase-out schedule of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.

The rate must be based on allowable expenditures from cost information gathered. Under section [144.9507, subdivision 5](/statutes/cite/144.9507#stat.144.9507.5), federal medical assistance funds may not replace existing funding for lead-related activities. The nonfederal share of costs for services provided under this subdivision must be from state or local funds and is the responsibility of the agency providing the risk assessment. When the risk assessment is conducted by the commissioner of health, the state share must be from appropriations to the commissioner of health for this purpose. Eligible expenditures for the nonfederal share of costs may not be made from federal funds or funds used to match other federal funds. Any federal disallowances are the responsibility of the agency providing risk assessment services. For complex medical procedures with a high degree of variation in outcomes, for which the Medicare program requires facilities providing the services to meet certain criteria as a condition of coverage, the commissioner may develop centers of excellence facility criteria in consultation with the Health Services Advisory Council under subdivision 3c. The criteria must reflect facility traits that have been linked to superior patient safety and outcomes for the procedures in question, and must be based on the best available empirical evidence. For medical assistance recipients enrolled on a fee-for-service basis, the commissioner may make coverage for these procedures conditional upon the facility providing the services meeting the specified criteria. Only facilities meeting the criteria may be reimbursed for the procedures in question. [See Note.] (a) Medical assistance covers services provided in a licensed birth center by a licensed health professional if the service would otherwise be covered if provided in a hospital. (b) Facility services provided by a birth center shall be paid at the lower of billed charges or 70 percent of the statewide average for a facility payment rate made to a hospital for an uncomplicated vaginal birth as determined using the most recent calendar year for which complete claims data is available. If a recipient is transported from a birth center to a hospital prior to the delivery, the payment for facility services to the birth center shall be the lower of billed charges or 15 percent of the average facility payment made to a hospital for the services provided for an uncomplicated vaginal delivery as determined using the most recent calendar year for which complete claims data is available. (c) Nursery care services provided by a birth center shall be paid the lower of billed charges or 70 percent of the statewide average for a payment rate paid to a hospital for nursery care as determined by using the most recent calendar year for which complete claims data is available.

If a recipient is transported from a birth center to a hospital prior to the delivery, a licensed traditional midwife who does not perform the delivery may not bill for any delivery services. Services are not covered if provided by an unlicensed traditional midwife. (e) The commissioner shall apply for any necessary waivers from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to allow birth centers and birth center providers to be reimbursed. (a) Except when specifically prohibited by the commissioner or federal law, a provider may seek payment from the recipient for services not eligible for payment under the medical assistance program when the provider, prior to delivering the service, reviews and considers all other available covered alternatives with the recipient and obtains a signed acknowledgment from the recipient of the potential of the recipient's liability. The signed acknowledgment must be in a form approved by the commissioner. (b) Conditions under which a provider must not request payment from the recipient include, but are not limited to: (1) a service that requires prior authorization, unless authorization has been denied as not medically necessary and all other therapeutic alternatives have been reviewed; (2) a service for which payment has been denied for reasons relating to billing requirements; (3) standard shipping or delivery and setup of medical equipment or medical supplies; (4) services that are included in the recipient's long term care per diem; (5) the recipient is enrolled in the Restricted Recipient Program and the provider is one of a provider type designated for the recipient's health care services; and (6) the noncovered service is a prescription drug identified by the commissioner as having the potential for abuse and overuse, except where payment by the recipient is specifically approved by the commissioner on the date of service based upon compelling evidence supplied by the prescribing provider that establishes medical necessity for that particular drug. (c) The payment requested from recipients for noncovered services under this subdivision must not exceed the provider's usual and customary charge for the actual service received by the recipient. A recipient must not be billed for the difference between what medical assistance paid for the service or would pay for a less costly alternative service. (a)(1) Medical assistance covers in-reach community-based service coordination that is performed through a hospital emergency department as an eligible procedure under a state healthcare program for a frequent user.

(b) Reimbursement must be made in 15-minute increments and allowed for up to 60 days posthospital discharge based upon the specific identified emergency department visit or inpatient admitting event. In-reach community-based service coordination shall seek to connect frequent users with existing covered services available to them, including, but not limited to, targeted case management, waiver case management, or care coordination in a health care home. For children and young adults with a serious emotional disturbance, in-reach community-based service coordination includes navigating and arranging for community-based services prior to discharge to address a client's mental health, chemical health, social, educational, family support and housing needs, or any other activity targeted at reducing multiple incidents of emergency room use, inpatient readmissions, and other nonmedically necessary health care utilization. In-reach services shall seek to connect them with existing covered services, including targeted case management, waiver case management, care coordination in a health care home, children's therapeutic services and supports, crisis services, and respite care. Eligible in-reach service coordinators must hold a minimum of a bachelor's degree in social work, public health, corrections, or a related field. The commissioner shall submit any necessary application for waivers to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to implement this subdivision. (c)(1) For the purposes of this subdivision, \"in-reach community-based service coordination\" means the practice of a community-based worker with training, knowledge, skills, and ability to access a continuum of services, including housing, transportation, chemical and mental health treatment, employment, education, and peer support services, by working with an organization's staff to transition an individual back into the individual's living environment. In-reach community-based service coordination includes working with the individual during their discharge and for up to a defined amount of time in the individual's living environment, reducing the individual's need for readmittance. (2) Hospitals utilizing in-reach service coordinators shall report annually to the commissioner on the number of adults, children, and adolescents served; the postdischarge services which they accessed; and emergency department/psychiatric hospitalization readmissions. The commissioner shall ensure that services and payments provided under in-reach care coordination do not duplicate services or payments provided under section [256B.0753](/statutes/cite/256B.0753), [256B.0755](/statutes/cite/256B.0755), or [256B.0625, subdivision 20](/statutes/cite/256B.0625#stat.256B.0625.20).

For services rendered on or after July 1, 2003, for facilities reimbursed under this chapter or chapter 256R, the Medicaid program shall only pay a co-payment during a Medicare-covered skilled nursing facility stay if the Medicare rate less the resident's co-payment responsibility is less than the case mix adjusted total payment rate under chapter 256R. The amount that shall be paid by the Medicaid program is equal to the amount by which the case mix adjusted total payment rate exceeds the Medicare rate less the co-payment responsibility. Health plans paying for nursing home services under section [256B.69, subdivision 6a](/statutes/cite/256B.69#stat.256B.69.6a), may limit payments as allowed under this subdivision. (a) Medical assistance covers early and periodic screening, diagnosis, and treatment services (EPSDT). In administering the EPSDT program, the commissioner shall, at a minimum: (1) provide information to children and families, using the most effective mode identified, regarding: (i) the benefits of preventative health care visits; (ii) the services available as part of the EPSDT program; and (iii) assistance finding a provider, transportation, or interpreter services; (2) maintain an up-to-date periodicity schedule published in the department policy manual, taking into consideration the most up-to-date community standard of care; and (3) maintain up-to-date policies for providers on the delivery of EPSDT services that are in the provider manual on the department website. (b) The commissioner may contract for the administration of the outreach services as required within the EPSDT program. (c) The commissioner may contract for the required EPSDT outreach services, including but not limited to children enrolled or attributed to an integrated health partnership demonstration project described in section [256B.0755](/statutes/cite/256B.0755). Integrated health partnerships that choose to include the EPSDT outreach services within the integrated health partnership's contracted responsibilities must receive compensation from the commissioner on a per-member per-month basis for each included child. Integrated health partnerships must accept responsibility for the effectiveness of outreach services it delivers. For children who are not a part of the demonstration project, the commissioner may contract for the administration of the outreach services. (d) The payment amount for a complete EPSDT screening shall not include charges for health care services and products that are available at no cost to the provider and shall not exceed the rate established per Minnesota Rules, part [9505.0445](/rules/9505.0445), item M, effective October 1, 2010. Medical assistance covers services provided by advanced dental therapists and dental therapists when provided within the scope of practice identified in sections [150A.105](/statutes/cite/150A.105) and [150A.106](/statutes/cite/150A.106). (a) Medical assistance covers services provided by community paramedics who are certified under section [144E.28, subdivision 9](/statutes/cite/144E.28#stat.144E.28.9), when the services are provided in accordance with this subdivision to an eligible recipient as defined in paragraph (b). (b) For purposes of this subdivision, an eligible recipient is defined as an individual who has received hospital emergency department services three or more times in a period of four consecutive months in the past 12 months or an individual who has been identified by the individual's primary health care provider for whom community paramedic services identified in paragraph (c) would likely prevent admission to or would allow discharge from a nursing facility; or would likely prevent readmission to a hospital or nursing facility. (c) Payment for services provided by a community paramedic under this subdivision must be a part of a care plan ordered by a primary health care provider in consultation with the medical director of an ambulance service and must be billed by an eligible provider enrolled in medical assistance that employs or contracts with the community paramedic. The care plan must ensure that the services provided by a community paramedic are coordinated with other community health providers and local public health agencies and that community paramedic services do not duplicate services already provided to the patient, including home health and waiver services. Community paramedic services shall include health assessment, chronic disease monitoring and education, medication compliance, immunizations and vaccinations, laboratory specimen collection, hospital discharge follow-up care, and minor medical procedures approved by the ambulance medical director. (d) Services provided by a community paramedic to an eligible recipient who is also receiving care coordination services must be in consultation with the providers of the recipient's care coordination services. (e) The commissioner shall seek the necessary federal approval to implement this subdivision. (a) Medical assistance covers services provided by a community emergency medical technician (CEMT) who is certified under section [144E.275, subdivision 7](/statutes/cite/144E.275#stat.144E.275.7), when the services are provided in accordance with this subdivision. (b) A CEMT may provide a postdischarge visit, after discharge from a hospital or skilled nursing facility, when ordered by a treating physician, advanced practice registered nurse, or physician assistant. The postdischarge visit includes: (1) verbal or visual reminders of discharge orders; (2) recording and reporting of vital signs to the patient's primary care provider; (3) medication access confirmation; (4) food access confirmation; and (5) identification of home hazards. (c) An individual who has repeat ambulance calls due to falls or has been identified by the individual's primary care provider as at risk for nursing home placement, may receive a safety evaluation visit from a CEMT when ordered by a primary care provider in accordance with the individual's care plan. A safety evaluation visit includes: (1) medication access confirmation; (2) food access confirmation; and (3) identification of home hazards. (d) A CEMT shall be paid at $9.75 per 15-minute increment. A safety evaluation visit may not be billed for the same day as a postdischarge visit for the same individual.

Participation of an enrollee in an approved clinical trial does not preclude coverage of medically necessary services covered under this chapter that are not related to the approved clinical trial. Any items or services that are provided solely to satisfy data collection and analysis for a clinical trial, and not for direct clinical management of the enrollee, are not covered. MS 2020 [Repealed, [2021 c 30 art 17 s 113](/laws/?id=30&year=2021&type=0)] Medical assistance covers treatment of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) and pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS). Coverage shall be developed in collaboration with the Health Services Advisory Council established under subdivision 3c. (a) Medical assistance covers enhanced asthma care services and related products to be provided in the children's homes for children with poorly controlled asthma. To be eligible for services and products under this subdivision, a child must: (1) have poorly controlled asthma defined by having received health care for the child's asthma from a hospital emergency department at least one time in the past year or have been hospitalized for the treatment of asthma at least one time in the past year; and (2) receive a referral for services and products under this subdivision from a treating health care provider. (b) Covered services include home visits provided by a registered environmental health specialist or lead risk assessor currently credentialed by the Department of Health or a healthy homes specialist credentialed by the Building Performance Institute. (c) Covered products include the following allergen-reducing products that are identified as needed and recommended for the child by a registered environmental health specialist, healthy homes specialist, lead risk assessor, certified asthma educator, public health nurse, or other health care professional providing asthma care for the child, and proven to reduce asthma triggers: (1) allergen encasements for mattresses, box springs, and pillows; (2) an allergen-rated vacuum cleaner, filters, and bags; (3) a dehumidifier and filters; (4) HEPA single-room air cleaners and filters; (5) integrated pest management, including traps and starter packages of food storage containers; (6) a damp mopping system; (7) if the child does not have access to a bed, a waterproof hospital-grade mattress; and (8) for homeowners only, furnace filters. (d) The commissioner shall determine additional products that may be covered as new best practices for asthma care are identified. (e) A home assessment is a home visit to identify asthma triggers in the home and to provide education on trigger-reducing products. A child is limited to two home assessments except that a child may receive an additional home assessment if the child moves to a new home; if a new asthma trigger, including tobacco smoke, enters the home; or if the child's health care provider identifies a new allergy for the child, including an allergy to mold, pests, pets, or dust mites. The commissioner shall determine the frequency with which a child may receive a product under paragraph (c) or (d) based on the reasonable expected lifetime of the product.
