Baker, Chair, Senator Brian T. Taniguchi, Vice Chair, and other Distinguished Members of the Senate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection: On behalf of myself and my many patients who benefit greatly from naturopathic care I write you with very strong objections to SB2577 SDl. Naturopathic physicians have proved to be competent practitioners and to have an important role in healthcare in Hawaii. Time and time again patients write in support of the care they have received and our history proves our safety. Since the expanded scope of practice in 2009 there have been no reports filed against NDs for prescribing issues. In fact, NDs across the country have a stellar record of prescription, safety. Excerpt from the California Bureau of Naturopathic Medicine, January 2007 Report In preparation for this report, the Bureau contacted the licensing agencies for each of the states that allow NDs to prescribe. None of the states reported any patient harm or disciplinary action due to ND prescribing. In addition, the states were not aware of any civil actions against NDs for prescribing. The Bureau also contacted NCMIC Insurance Company. NCMIC insures NDs in all of the licensing states and also insures the naturopathic medical schools. In a letter to the Bureau dated June 7, 2006, NCMIC stated: \"IN the five years that NCMIC has been insuring Naturopathic Physicians and the colleges, we have never opened a claim against a Naturopathic Physician involving prescription medications.\" SB2577 SDl would put an absolutely unnecessary burden on the medical community by requiring naturopathic physicians to report directly to MDs. This is ludicrous and once again feels like a turf war by allopathic practitioners. For years I have sat in on legislative hearings and heard blatant misinformation being given about naturopathic education. It is beyond time that legislators take a few minutes to educate themselves so this does not continue to repeat itself. Please read the attached file and understand the extensive training that we do have. The fact that Nurse Practitioners have a significantly greater scope of practice in Hawaii than NDs with significantly fewer hours lends again to misinformation about education. They currently are able to prescribe virtually all prescription drugs, with the following exceptions (NDs do not have any prescriptive rights for controlled substances and cannot even obtain a DEA number in this state). HAWAII ADMINISTRATIVE RULES, TITLE 16, DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS ,CHAPTER 89 (NURSES) Exhibit A: The Exclusionary Formulary shall consist of: lnvestigationa/ drugs except as part of an /RB-approved clinical trial, Stimulants and hormones for treatment of obesity, Human Growth hormones, anabolic steroids, or hormones for performance enhancement or decreasing the impact of aging, Methadone for maintenance or detoxification of a narcotic\u00ad dependent person as restricted in HRS 329-121, and Medical marijuana as restricted in HRS section 329-121. Having one physician oversee another physician means more paperwork and time for already overworked individuals. Naturopathic and allopathic educations have many similarities and we both get training to make us competent primary care physicians (including pharmaceutical therapies). However, they are different and to think an MD could understand ND prescriptions, especially of a nutritional nature, when that is not their training, makes no sense. It also brings up numerous issues of patient confidentiality, insurance issues, additional paperwork, and difference in perspective between practitioners of different schools of thought. Last but not least objectionable, SB2577 SDl would also place inappropriate and unreasonable limits on the naturopathic formulary by excluding such current prescription items as certain injectable medicines, vaccines, and medical oxygen. To deny us the use of basic prescriptive drugs like anti-hypertensives puts our patients and us in a situation that would require many unnecessary ER visits. The Hawaii board has already adopted standards of practice, care, competency, and safety for naturopathic physicians that are among the most rigorous in the nation. Hawaii's naturopathic physicians have even gone so far as to voluntarily recommend that they complete 15 hours of continuing education bi-annually in pharmacology. SB2577 SDl is a highly regressive proposal reflecting a failure to honor and understand an entire profession. It would reverse many positive gains that naturopathic physicians have rightfully achieved, and by reducing the effectiveness of many of our very best primary care doctors, have numerous negative consequences for the people of Hawaii. Thank you for your consideration of my testimony in strong opposition to this bill. Sincerely, Aloha, Dr Sarah Strong, ND Hilo Natural Health Clinic (4325) and more! IEJFacebook What is a Naturopathic Physician? As defined by the US Department of Laborl: Naturopathic physicians diagnose, treat, and help prevent diseases using a system of practice that is based on the natural healing capacity of individuals. Naturopathic physicians may use physiological, psychological or mechanical methods. They may also use natural medicines, prescription or legend drugs, foods, herbs, or other natural remedies. Naturopathic Physicians generally practice as primary care providers and are licensed to do so in the state of Hawaii. In all licensed states, Naturopathic Physicians used the same modern diagnostic methods employed by all licensed primary care providers. This includes labs, imaging such as x-ray, CT scans, MRI's, and ultrasound. These, along with history, clinical presentation, and physical exam are all employed in reaching a diagnosis. Referrals are made to specialists or other healthcare providers for additional testing or treatment when necessary. How is a Naturopathic Physician Educated? Naturopathic Physicians attend four-year, graduate level medical programs at institutions recognized by the US Department of Education. (Appendix A: Regulatory Agencies) The professional regulating agency for naturopathic medical schools is the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME). The schools also have attained regional accreditation from such agencies as The Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. There are currently seven such schools in the United States and Canada. Naturopathic medical education consists of a four-year post-baccalaureate profession program that incorporates naturopathic philosophy, biomedical sciences, clinical sciences, and supervised patient care. Prerequisite course work for entry is similar to that of tradition medical colleges and includes general and organic chemistry, biology and physics, among others. N aturopathic medical schools provide the same foundational coursework as conventional medical schools. (Appendix B: Hours of Pharmacology required for ND/NMD degree), (Appendix Cl: School Curriculum from National College of Natural Medicine), (Appendix C2: Bastyr University Book List), {Appendix D: Southwest College ofNaturopathic Medicine curriculum correlated to university of Iowa Roy] and Lucille A Carver College of Medicine). In facts, ND programs often provide more pharmacology and physiology than conventional medical schools. The first two years of study the curriculum focuses on clinical and basic sciences and diagnostics covering: anatomy, biochemistry, human physiology, histology, human pathology, immunology, macro and microbiology, neuroscience and pharmacology. The final two years students intern in clinical settings under supervision of licensed professionals demonstrating skills in laboratory and clinical diagnosis and learn additional therapeutic modalities such as botanical medicine, clinical counseling, homeopathy and naturopathic physical medicine, approximately 1500 required clinical hours. nutrition, including ND students must sit for and pass two board exams known as the Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Exam (NPLEX). (Appendix E: NPLEX Examinations). The NPLEX exam is divided into 2 parts. NPLEX Part I, biomedical science examination is the equivalent to USMLE step 1. This is a systems based exam taken upon successful completion of graduate level training in anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, genetics, microbiology, immunology and pathology at a CNME approved naturopathic medical school. It is a clinically oriented examination requiring the synthesis of all basic sciences. NPLEX Part II is comparable to USMLE Steps 2 and 3 with an emphasis on the knowledge needed to begin practice as a solo practitioner. This is taken after graduation from a CNME approved naturopathic medical school. It is a case based exam, requiring the synthesis and application of knowledge of the clinical sciences the Naturopathic Physicians must have in order to practice safely. Safety of Naturopathic Medicine Health is a right that all residents of Hawaii deserve access to. Naturopathic Physicians are healthcare providers that are professionally trained to work with other branches of medicine to offer the best and safest health care available. Naturopathic Physicians have a phenomenal safety record. In states that license and insure NDs, coverage costs, reports and claims are significantly lower than those found in conventional medicine. Malpractice claims against CAM practitioners occur less frequently and typically involve less severe injury than claims against conventional physicians. 2.3 Safety Record of ND Prescribing ND's have a long history of safe prescribing practices, in the states that offer prescriptive rights for ND's. Currently, 15 states, the District of Columbia, and the US territories of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands have licensing laws for naturopathic doctors. Of the 15 states 13 plus DC currently have prescriptive authority and variable formularies. Presently, efforts are underway in the remaining licensed states without prescriptive authority to enhance scope of practice to include prescriptive rights. (Appendix G: Licensed States and Prescriptive Authority) Excerpt from the California Bureau of Naturopathic Medicine. January 2007 Report In preparation for this report, the Bureau contacted the licensing agencies for each of the states that allow NDs to prescribe. None of the states reported ~ Hwii Sodty of ~ Naturopathic Physicians any patient harm or disciplinary action due to ND prescribing. In addition, the states were not aware of any civil actions against NDs for prescribing. The Bureau also contacted NCMIC Insurance Company, NCMIC insures NDs in all of the licensing states and also insures the naturopathic medical schools. In a letter to the Bureau dated June 7, 2006, NCMIC stated: \"IN the five years that NCMIC has been insuring Naturopathic Physicians and the colleges, we have never opened a claim against a Naturopathic Physician involving prescription medications.\" Additionally, the Committee contacted Jury Verdicts Northwest (JVN) to see if there were any civil actions filed against a licensed ND. JVN covers both Oregon and Washington, the two states with the greatest number of NDs and that have been licensing NDs for a considerable length of time (since 1919 and 1927, respectively). JVN responded \"Upon reviewing cases contained in Jury Verdicts Northwest's database we found no cases against naturopaths for prescription negligence, or for that matter our database contained no cases against naturopaths at all.\" 4 An updated report from NCMIC and JVN were also obtained recently. JVN did in fact provide updated information and it should be noted that JVN has provided information regarding civil jury verdict for accurate case evaluation, litigation and settlement negotiations since 1962. They offer summaries from Washington, Idaho, Oregon and Alaska. All of these states license Naturopathic Physicians. As discussed above Washington and Oregon are the two states with the greatest number of practicing NDs. The updated report from JVN, dated April 7, 2010 states \"Upon reviewing cases contained in Jury Verdicts Northwest's database from September 2005 to present we found no cases against naturopaths for prescription negligence, or for that matter our database contained no cases against naturopaths.\" We also received an update from NCMIC. NCMIC, located in Des Moines, Iowa, is the largest insurer for Naturopathic Physicians and has been offering this coverage since 2001 in all states that recognize and license the profession. A letter from the Vice President of claims, dated May3, 2010 states \"In the years that NCMIC has been insuring Naturopathic Physicians and the colleges, we have never opened a claim based on an allegation against a Naturopathic Physician involving prescription medications.\" ~-~ - HwiiSodetyof ~ Naturopathic Physicians Naturopathic Medicine Lowers Health Care Costs In a recent study conducted by Green Mountain Wellness Solutions for the Vermont Automobile Dealers Association in 2005-2006, 848 employees were examined and advised by Naturopathic Physicians for one year. The organization saved $1.5 million in direct and indirect medical costs the first year. Further, the drastic reduction in health risk factors has resulted in a decrease in insurance premiums for each year the program has been in place. (Appendix H: VADA Wellness Program). Diabetes, heart disease and cancer are all considered preventable conditions, yet the current health care system has shown little efficacy in preventative medicine. 10,11,12,13,14 Naturopathic Medicine has proven itself to be significantly more effective in improving health and reducing health care costs. 1s The Oregon Office of Medical Assistance provided data showing that Naturopathic Medical Services have been \"57.5% more cost effective than MD/DO/NP combined services in the last 4 years.\" 16 The King County report from Regence Blue Shield of Washington states that \"preliminary outcome suggests that an effective ND PCP centered managed care program could cut the costs of chronic and stress related illness by up to 40%.\" 17 Conclusion Naturopathic Physicians are trained as experts in the integration of conventional and natural medicine. They are leaders in health promotion and have extensive training in pharmacology, drug-herb interaction, and alternative non-invasive approaches to disease management. Their didactic training includes all the same coursework as conventional (MD/DO) physicians along with additional coursework in naturopathic therapeutics. The curriculum standards are exceptional and accredited by the US Department of Education accrediting agency. Please demonstrate your support for safe and responsible medicine. We ask that you provide your support to our efforts in the upcoming session. We look forward to continuing to have open communication with those involved in the legislative process to ensure transparency in our legislation. We also welcome feedback and hope to establish a cooperative relationship. Hawaii Society of N aturopathic Physicians Endnotes 1 http:/ /online.onetcenter.org/link/summary /29-1199.04 z Cohen MH.

NABNE is responsible for approving applicants to take the NP LEX and for administering the examinations. NPLEX Examinations are case-based. This means that some type of clinical scenario is presented and several questions are asked that pertain to the case. The clinical scenario is very brief on the Part I -Biomedical Science Examination and more extensive on the Part II - Clinical Science Examinations. Items on the Part I -Biomedical Science Examination do not require clinical training, as all relate to the biomedical basis for the patient's condition, not diagnosis ortreatment. Items on the examinations are all in a multiple choice, single answer format (i.e., the \"stem\" asks a question and there are four response alternatives, only one of which is keyed as the correct answer). The examinee must select the best response from among the alternatives and mark the corresponding bubble on the answer sheet. Part I -Biomedical Science Examination A single, 200-item examination covers the topics of anatomy, physiology, biochemistry & genetics, microbiology & immunology, and pathology. The examination, which is scored with a single pass or fail designation, is administered in two sessions (morning and afternoon) of 2-1/2 hours each. Part II -Core Clinical Science Examination The single, integrated examination consists of90-100 case clusters (400 items). Each case cluster provides a clinical presentation, followed by 3-5 items pertaining to that case. This examination is given in three sections over the course of 3 days (3-1/2 hours each day). Part II -Clinical Elective Examinations NPLEX offers two elective examinations -Minor Surgery and Acupuncture -that are required by only some jurisdictions. Each SO-item examination is comprised of 10-15 case clusters (a brief clinical presentation followed by 3-5 items pertaining to that case). Examinees are allowed 60 minutes to complete each elective examination. ~ H~USoci,tyof W Naturopathic Physicians ~---\u00b7 Appendix F: Continuing Medical Education Requirements Comparing Average Annual Continuing Medical Education Requirements between Naturopathic Doctors (ND), Medical Doctors (MD) and Osteopathic Doctors (DO) STATE ND MD DO Alaska None 2S 2S Arizona 30 20 20 California 30 2S so Connecticut 1S 2S 2S D.C 1S None None Idaho 20 20 20 Iowa None 20 20 Kansas so so so Maine 37 so so Minnesota TBD 2S 2S Montana None None None New Hampshire so so so Oregon 2S None None Utah 12 20 20 Vermont 1S None 1S Washington 20 so so - --------- ----- ---~--Last updated Physicians Appendix G: Licensed States and Prescriptive Authority Currently, 15 states, the District of Columbia, and the US territories of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands have licensing laws for naturopathic doctors.

For those employees who participated: \u00b7Incidence of high blood pressure dropped 36% \u00b7 Incidence of diabetes dropped 13% \u00b7 Risk for cardiovascular disease dropped 35% \u00b7 Obesity fell by 15% \u00b7 Physical inactivity fell 21 % \u00b7 High cholesterol fell 17% \u00b7 Smoking fell by 17% \u00b7 High risk stress fell 24% For those employees who also participated in a supplementary pedometer program: \u00b7 High blood pressure dropped by 4 7% \u00b7 Diabetes fell by 20% \u00b7 Risks for cardiovascular disease fell 43% These figures do not only describe an improvement in the health of the employees. Since many of these conditions can be quite costly to treat through conventional care, the data also show a great reduction in the cost of healthcare for the employer. By using complimentary and alternative medical care the Vermont Automobile Dealers Association saved: \u00b7 $315,000 in direct health care costs \u00b7 $1,145,000 in indirect health care costs (absenteeism, low-productivity, etc.) \u00b7Almost $1,500,000 in total health care costs. The use of regulated naturopathic medical care is physically and economically beneficial to employers and employees alike. The care that naturopathic physicians provide is often less dangerous and uncomfortable then some more conventional medical treatments. Naturopathic care can also be less expensive than conventional medicine, making health care more available to those who otherwise could not afford it. Licensure minimizes the potential for malpractice of naturopathic medicine and maximizes the medical options available to residents oflicensed states. February 18, 2014 My Position: Opposition to SB2577 SDl Relating to Naturopathic Physicians To Senator Rosalyn H. Baker, Chair, Senator Brian T. Taniguchi, Vice Chair, and other Distinguished Members of the Senate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection: I'm writing to voice very strong objections to SB2577 SDl. The Legislature received well over 300 emails opposing SB2577, and only three in support, yet the Committee Report (SB2577 SDI SSCR2244) seemed to ignore this, stating only that the committee \"received testimony in opposition to this measure from Sakoda Construction, LLC, and several individuals.\" Why was a second hearing scheduled when there was such overwhelming opposition to this bill? \u00b7 SB2577 SD 1 would require naturopathic physicians to unreasonably reduce their current prescription rights -integral to their services -and add unfair burdens to their practices. This bill is illogical, unnecessary, and clearly biased against the naturopathic profession. It seems intended to foster conflict rather than cooperation in Hawaii's integrative health care community, and it's based on faulty assumptions about the education of naturopathic physicians. For example, the Committee Report incorrectly states that the education of naturopathic physicians \"offers very few contact hours of study on pharmacological treatment of disease.\" In fact, the hours of pharmacology training for naturopathic physicians are nearly the same as that of MDs, and greater than that of osteopaths. There are so many problems with this bill that adequately describing them all would require dozens of pages of testimony. The following is a brief summary, beginning with its most egregious flaws. First, this bill essentially proposes that naturopathic physicians, in order to continue qualifying for the prescription privileges the legislature wisely granted them (with overwhelming public support) years ago, would be required to have MDs \"review\" all of their prescriptions. According to the bill, these MDs would then \"address any concerns\" with these prescriptions, including the actual amounts prescribed, to the naturopathic physician and the board. This is worse than illogical, because: 1. The training of MDs does not at all qualify them for such a role. Allopathic education, compared to naturopathic education, has far fewer standards and requirements for training in the use of natural and preventive treatment modalities. SB2577 SD I reflects a misunderstanding of, or a disregard for, what a naturopathic physician is. The entire point of naturopathic physician's education and training is to become a distinctly different type of medical expert than an MD -one who is highly educated in an alternative system of medicine that differs in many ways from that of conventional allopathic physicians. MDs are not equipped by their training to provide a meaningful review of naturopathic prescriptions, or have a comprehensive understanding of the complex issues they involve. (In an attempt to defend the bill, the Committee Report states that \"naturopathic education differs from that received within allopathic or osteopathic medical schools.\" You cannot. have it both ways; if the training is different, then it makes no sense for MDs to review naturopathic prescriptions.) 2. The extensive medical training of naturopathic physicians already more than qualifies them for their current prescription privileges. 3. Such a proposal is conspicuously one-sided and unfair. Is a corresponding requirement placed on MDs and other health care providers? Should MDs be required to have naturopathic physicians review and monitor all of their prescription activities, since the training ofnaturopathic physicians is much more extensive in many important areas (particularly those pertaining to a broad range of natural and preventive treatments) than that ofMDs? 4. Appointing one type of physician to \"oversee\" another's jurisdiction raises all manner of legal and ethical concerns. It would be terrible public policy to require one kind of doctor to answer to another kind of doctor, trained in a different form of medicine, in order to simply maintain the prescription rights they were trained to have, especially when other types of doctors enjoy corresponding rights with no such requirement. Some have questioned whether a proposal of this kind may be unconstitutional and discriminatory. It would also be highly impractical, as it raises numerous dilemmas regarding patient rights, insurance issues, patient confidentiality, and more. Second, this bill would require naturopathic physicians to submit monthly reports to the board detailing every single item they prescribe, and require the board to report this data to the legislature annually. Again, this is blatantly unfair, since no corresponding requirement is placed on other types of physicians. It is also impractical and cumbersome: it would place a completely unnecessary burden of paperwork on many of our most valuable primary care physicians -which Hawaii already has a shortage of. And SB2577 SD 1 would further hinder the prescription process by requiring naturopathic physicians to receive authorization from the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs in order to prescribe any item on their own formulary. Last but not least objectionable, SB2577 SD I would also place inappropriate and unreasonable limits on the naturopathic formulary by excluding such current prescription items as certain injectable medicines, vaccines, and medical oxygen. There's no logical reason why naturopathic physicians should be singled out for any of the above\u00ad mentioned excesses ofSB2577 SDI. To the contrary, since naturopathic physicians received prescriptive authority nearly five years ago, no evidence of patient harm regarding their prescription rights has been brought to the board, and there has been no overuse of prescriptive authority and not one lawsuit filed in this regard. In addition, the public has benefitted enormously as a result of the current prescriptive rights of naturopathic physicians; countless people have improved their health, and the public continues to overwhelmingly support those rights. Furthermore, in other states where naturopathic physicians have prescriptive rights there's no precedent for such restrictive requirements as those proposed in SB2577 SD I. In fact, the Hawaii board has already adopted standards of practice, care, competency, and safety for naturopathic physicians that are among the most rigorous in the nation. Hawaii's naturopathic physicians have even gone so far as to voluntarily recommend that they complete 15 hours of continuing education bi-annually in pharmacology. (By the way, this is the ONLY portion of SB2577 SDI that is reasonable and should be proposed.) SB2577 SDI is a highly regressive proposal reflecting a failure to honor and understand an entire profession. It would reverse many positive gains that naturopathic physicians have rightfully achieved, and by reducing the effectiveness of many of our very best primary care doctors, have numerous negative consequences for the people of Hawaii. Thank you for your consideration of my testimony in strong opposition to this bill. Sincerely, Jennifer Kay Duncza I am writing to ask for a no vote on SB2577 SDI relating to naturopathic physicians. My relationship with my naturopathic doctor is extremely important to me and I do not want her ability to treat me hindered in any way. SB2577 SDI will do just that. Among other things, it would negatively affect my naturopathic doctor's ability to write certain prescriptions and would deprive me of other naturopathic care options. While I also have Kaiser coverage, my primary care comes from my naturopath. I urge a no vote on this bill. Thank you for your attention to this matter. Ted Herhold Theodore Townsend Herhold 62-2308 Vancouver, WA 98683 February 18th, 2014 Position: Strong Opposition to SB2577 SD1 Relating to Naturopathic Physicians Hearing at 10:30 am on February 2oth, 2014 in Conference Room 229 To the Honorable Senator Rosalyn H. Baker, .Chair, the Honorable Senator Brian T. Taniguchi, Vice Chair, and other Distinguished Members of the Senate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection: I'm writing to request that you do everything in your power to oppose SB2577 SD1 This bill would essentially require naturopathic physicians to restrict or give up prescription rights that are essential to their services. My naturopathic doctor's ability to write certain prescriptions when I need them, without the unreasonable restrictions proposed by SB2577 SD1, is an important part of my health care. There's no good reason for this bill, and every reason to oppose it. Since the Legislature rightfully granted Hawaii's naturopathic physicians prescriptive authority almost five years ago, there has been no evidence whatsoever of patient harm pertaining to these prescription rights brought to the naturopathic Board. There has also been no overuse of prescriptive authority, no cases of naturopathic physicians using it outside their training and scope of practice, and not one lawsuit filed in this regard. Instead, the public has benefitted greatly from this prescriptive authority. The training of naturopathic physicians sufficiently prepares them for their prescription privileges, and they are highly qualified to offer all the services they currently provide, to the full extent of their licensed scope of practice, which is well defined. Standards of care have recently been adopted by the Board that provides oversight and clear criteria for the practice of naturopathic medicine in Hawaii. The restrictive requirements in SB2577 SD1 have no precedent in other states where naturopathic physicians have prescriptive rights. Furthermore, the Hawaii naturopathic Board has set some of the highest standards in the US for the practice, safety, and competence of naturopathic physicians. Hawaii's naturopathic physicians have even taken the unusual step of voluntarily recommending that they complete 15 hours of continuing education in pharmacology biennially. One of the more misguided aspects of this bill is the proposal that naturopathic physicians would be required to have MDs review all of their prescriptions, including the amounts prescribed, and that these MD~ would address any concerns they have with these prescriptions to the naturopathic physician and the board. This is an extremely ill-conceived proposal. A naturopathic physician is a very different type of medical expert than an MD. With all due respect, MDs are not at all equipped to make sensible reviews of naturopathic prescriptions, because their education has few, if any, requirements for training in the use of naturopathic treatment modalities. The education of my naturopathic physician far exceeded that of any MD in many areas essential to my health care. Naturopathic doctors are highly trained to be independent providers who consult with other health professionals when they consider it appropriate for the patient, not when required by law to subordinate their expertise to individuals untrained in naturopathic medicine. In addition, requiring one type ~f doctor to oversee and review a very different type of doctor's practice would create endless implementation and legal problems when it comes to issues such as insurance, patient privacy, HIPAA laws, and much more. 882577 SD1 would also hinder naturopathic physicians and reduce their effectiveness by placing other unnE1cessary, inappropriate, and impractical burdens on their practices. These include the requirement that they submit detailed monthly repo1ts of each item they prescribe to the board, the requirement that they receive authorization from the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs in order to prescribe any item from their own formulary, and the requirement that certain important prescription items, such as vaccines, medical oxygen, and some injectable medicines, be excluded from t11e naturopathic formulary. In some cases, requirements that SB2577 SD1 would impose seem blatantly unfair, and may even be discriminatory, because no comparable requirements are placed on other types of physicians. If this bill is not stopped, it will undermine the high standards that the people of Hawaii have come to expect from naturopathic physicians. It will also reduce the quality of naturopathic care and the effectiveness of some of our most valued primary care providers, at a time when primary care physicians are already in short supply. The last thing we need is to turn back the clock on the prescriptive abilities of our naturopathic physicians, Please oppose SB2577 SD1 and protect my access to the high level of naturopathic care that I deserve. Thank you, Claire Fanger To Whom It May Concern: I am currently a student ofNaturopathic Medicine at National College of Natural Medicine. Like many of my colleagues, I was accepted to many conventional medical schools and programs throughout the country, but was unimpressed with their emphasis on subspecialties rather than primary care. As a medically trained Naturopathic Doctor, I will achieve a high degree of training as a primary care trained physician but exit my program witha lower loan burden, which -when matched with insurance coverage and parity with other providers -will allow me to provide a cost-effective form of primary health care that will be accessible and will improve the health of families. In many ways our training is comparable to conventional physicians, but it is also very different: in addition to pharmaceutical prescriptions, we are also highly skilled in other therapeutic modalities that support patients' wellbeing. The efficacy of this multi-faceted approach, which sometimes involves the judicious use of pharmaceutical prescriptions, has been shown to improve the health outcomes of Americans and decrease health care costs. For more information on the cost\u00ad effectiveness ofNaturopathic Medicine, please refer to the Natural Medicine Journal study (attached): \"The Economic Evaluation of Complementary and Alternative Medicine: The growing importance of including naturopathic doctors in healthcare reform.\" Below is an excerpt from the conclusion of the study. \"The United States healthcare system is not only grappling with rising costs but it is also facing an undeniable shortage of primary care providers, with an estimated projected shortage of 52,000 primary care doctors by 2025.73,74 Given that an estimated 46 million Americans do not have access to healthcare due to financial, physical, and geographic barriers,75,76 increasing access to cost-effective primary care is imperative.77 With the increasing popularity of CAM (Complementary & Alternative Medicine), CAM providers' orientation toward health promotion and prevention, and the growing body of research demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of CAM, policy makers and insurers invested in addressing the rising cost of healthcare should work to ensure that implementation of the Affordable Care Act proceeds as intended (inclusive of CAM providers). While naturopathic physicians are often lumped into the designation of CAM provider, it is important to note that they are also trained (and licensed in several states) as primary care doctors known for emphasizing health promoting activities and disease prevention.\"78,79. The men and women of your state and indeed the country are counting on you to make unbiased and honest decisions that can help them gain economic access and freedom of choice in the healthcare marketplace. SB2577 SDI would place impractical and inappropriate burdens on naturopathic physicians' practices. These include the requirement that they submit detailed monthly reports of each item they prescribe to the board, the requirement that they receive authorization from the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs in order to prescribe any item from their own formulary, and the requirement that certain important prescription items, such as vaccines, medical oxygen, and some injectable medicines, be excluded from the naturopathic formulary.

The last thing we need is to tum back the clock on the prescriptive abilities of our naturopathic physicians.

Functional bowel disease (FBD) refers to a group of chronic bowel disorders of a physiologic origin (irritable bowel ~yndrome, funchona! diarrhea, functional constipation, and funcbonal abdominal pain). Roughly 30 mlllfon people In the United States meet the dlagnosUc e1iteria l'or lrntable sy1)drome (IBS) alone, and FBD Is associated with high healthcare costs and more frequent healthcare llisits.51 \u00b7 52 Conventional treatment strategies are limited for mitigating 5ymptoms. Racent!y. the cost and perceived effec~veness of CAM was studied in 1,012 patient& w1lh FBD over a 6.month penod.sz Patients from a healthcare maintenance organization were followed for 6 months, using questionnaires Iha\\ assess symptom severity. quality of life, and utlllzatlon antl expenditures on CAM (limited to herbal medicine!'>, t1orneopalhy, hypnotherapy, massage, yoga, biofeedback, and acupuncture). nie cost 01 conventional medical ~re was ascertained frtlm admlnistrativ'.! claims.

Visits with naturopathic doctors were not considered In ihls sludy. f~nother explanation for the seemingly low median cost of CAM among study parlicipams is that the mostc<nr1mor1!y used CAM therapy reported was ginger(14%).

There were several limitations of the study. The authors chose le ignore the use of problorics and tlber. suggesUng that these am \"more likely considered a part of conventional care; and only insurance dnims billed under conventional providers were used. Further studies on the Ctlst--e1!ecUveness of tile naturopathic management of FBD are needed. Natural Health Products In 2007, a t>ystematic review of randomized controlled trials on n\u00b7alural health products (NHPs) was performed. 55 NHPs am defined as vitamins, mineraJs, herbal mecl!cines. hom<:?opalhic remedies, amino acids, and essenllal the systemaUc review, pooled searches of varlcus databases uncovered 585 original studies, however only 9 c..f these studies inclu<.led a cost evaluation and exduded populations wlth a known nutritional de~dency.

A Systematic Review of Economic Evaluations of CIM An extensive syi;temalic review war, conducted on economic evaluations of r.ompl(1mentary and Integrative rr1edlc1ne (CIM) pub!lshEJd be~11een 2001 and 2010, fesul1ing in 204 research studies that contained economic e11a!uatior1s ot ~IM.6; 111e proposed objec.'tlva of the sludy was to estatl!ish the extent or publications of research studies conducting economic eva.luaticms on CIM. The authors rmind that the bl!mest concentration of avalualions {19 studies) involved manlpu!abve (chiropractic and osteopathic techniques) and massage therapy for!ow back pain, althougl1 U1e studies were notably diverse In temis of the>rap!es used and the n!ltura of bar.I< pain treatad (acute vs chronic).

Conclusion The United Stales healthcare syste.m Is not only grappling with rising costs but it Is also facing an undeniable shortage, of primary care providers, witl1 an m:itimaled projectad r,hortF.ige of 52.000 primary care that an eslirnaled 4/l million Amerlcarrn do nC>t have access to healthcare due to financial, physical, and geographic barriers,7576 increasing access to cost-effective primary care is imperative.77 VVilh thci inO'\"easing popularity of CAM, CAM provldarn' orientation toward haalth promotion and prevention, and the growing body or research demonstrating Iha cost-elfectivaness of CAM, policy makers and Insurers i1wested in addressing the rising cost of healthcare should work to ensure that implementation of the Affordable Care Act proceeds as Intended (inci\\Jsive of CAM providers). \\.\\1hile naturopathic physlcim1s are often lumped Into the des1gnaUon of CAM provider, It is Jmpo11an1 to note th al U1ey are alsO trained (and licensed in several states} as primary care doctors known for emphasizing health promoting activities and disf,ase prevention.7879 Language In the Affordable Care Act prr.wtdes for lndudlng naturopathic pnma1y care providers In the crea11on of medical homes; doing so would be prudent in light of current statistics that only half or Americans are receiving recommended preventative care services.80 A no!ab!e Umitalion of this review is that the eco11omic evaluatlons presented ware conducted from a variety of perspectives (patient. payer. societ~l-What Is coM\u00b7effectivfJ from one perflpective many not be from another peri;pet.\"tlve.

Comment Cop1cha 96755 February 19, 2014 Position: Strong Opposition to SB2577 SDI Relating to Naturopathic Physicians Hearing at 10:30 am on February 20th, 2014 in Conference Room 229 To the Honorable Senator Rosalyn H. Baker, Chair, the Honorable Senator Brian T. Taniguchi, Vice Chair, and other Distinguished Members of the Senate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection: I'm writing to request that you do everything in your power to oppose SB2577 SDI. This bill would essentially require naturopathic physicians to restrict or give up prescription rights that are essential to their services. My naturopathic doctor's ability to write certain prescriptions when I need them, without the unreasonable restrictions proposed by SB2577 SD 1, is an important part of my health care. Since the Legislature rightfully granted Hawaii's naturopathic physicians prescriptive authority almost five years ago, there has been no evidence whatsoever of patient harm pertaining to these prescription rights brought to the naturopathic Board. There has also been no overuse of prescriptive authority, no cases of naturopathic physicians using it outside their training and scope of practice, and not one lawsuit filed in this regard. Instead, the public has benefitted greatly from this prescriptive authority. The training ofnaturopathic physicians sufficiently prepares them for their prescription privileges, and they are highly qualified to offer all the services they currently provide, to the full extent of their licensed scope of practice, which is well defined. Standards of care have recently been adopted by the Board that provide oversight and clear criteria for the practice of naturopathic medicine in Hawaii. The restrictive requirements in SB2577 SD 1 have no precedent in other states where naturopathic physicians have prescriptive rights. Furthermore, the Hawaii naturopathic Board has set some of the highest standards in the US for the practice, safety, and competence of naturopathic physicians. Hawaii's naturopathic physicians have even taken the unusual step of voluntarily recommending that they complete 15 hours of continuing education in pharmacology biennially. SB2577 SDI requires your Naturopathic Physician to have MDs review all of their prescriptions, including the amounts prescribed, and that these MDs would address any concerns they have ------------------with these prescriptions to the naturopathic physician and the board. This is an extremely ill\u00ad conceived proposal. A naturopathic physician is a very different type of medical expert than an MD. With all due respect, MDs are not at all equipped to make sensible reviews ofnaturopathic prescriptions, because.their education has few, if any, requirements for training in the use of naturopathic treatment modalities. The education of my naturopathic physician far exceeded that of any MD in many areas essential to my health care. Naturopathic doctors are highly trained to be independent providers who consult with other health professionals when they consider it appropriate for the patient, not when required by law to subordinate their expertise to individuals untrained in naturopathic medicine. In addition, requiring one type of doctor to oversee and review a very different type of doctor's practice would create endless implementation and legal problems when it comes to issues such as insurance, patient privacy, HIP AA laws, and much more. SB2577 SD 1 would also hinder naturopathic physicians and reduce their effectiveness by placing other unnecessary, inappropriate, and impractical burdens on their practices. These include the requirement that they submit detailed monthly reports of each item they prescribe to the board, the requirement that they receive authorization from the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs in order to prescribe any item from their own formulary, and the requirement that certain important prescription items, such as vaccines, medical oxygen, and some injectable medicines, be excluded from the naturopathic formulary. In some cases, requirements that SB2577 SDI would impose seem blatantly unfair, and may even be discriminatory, because no comparable requirements are placed on other types of physicians. If SB2577 SD 1 is not stopped, it will undermine the high standards that the people of Hawaii have come to expect from naturopathic physicians. It will also reduce the quality of naturopathic care and the effectiveness of some of our most valued primary care providers, at a time when primary care physicians are already in short supply. The last thing we need is to turn back the clock on the prescriptive abilities of our naturopathic physicians. Please oppose SB2577 SDI and protect my access to the high level ofnaturopathic care that I deserve. Thank you, Ginger Roberts James Crouse 2013NE110th Ct.

This bill would essentially require naturopathic physicians to restrict or give up prescription rights that are essential to their services. I know how important it is for my naturopathic doctor's ability to write certain prescriptions when I need them. The case is the same in Hawaii and without the unreasonable restrictions proposed by SB2577 SD1 is an important part of the health care and of all Hawaiian residents. Additionally, as a naturopathic medical student considering opening a specialty clinic in Hawaii after graduation, if this bill were to pass, my colleagues and I would no longer pursue opening this or any business in your state. This bill could even destroy patients' relationship with their doctor altogether, because the requirements in SB2577 SD1 are so draconian that some naturopathic physicians could feel compelled to leave Hawaii if the bill passes. Considering the existing shortage of primary care physicians and the rising cost of health care, passing this bill would be an immense disservice to the people of Hawaii as it would further reduce access to affordable standard, natural and traditional medicine and primary care physicians.

These include the requirement that they submit detailed montl1ly repo11s of each item they prescribe to the board, the requirement that they receive auihori7.ation from the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs in order to prescribe any item from their own fonnulary, and the requirement that ce11ain importall! prescription items, such as vaccines., medical oxygen, and some i1tjectable medicines, be excluded from the naturopathic formulary.

Baker, Chair, the Honorable Senator Brian T. Taniguchi, Vice Chair, and other Distinguished Members of the Senate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection: I'm writing to request that you do everything in your power to oppose SB2577 SD 1 This bill would essentially require naturopathic physicians to restrict or give up prescription rights that are essential to their services. My naturopathic doctor's ability to write certain prescriptions when I need them, without the unreasonable restrictions proposed by SB2577 SD 1, is an important part of my health care. There's no good reason for this bill, and every reason to oppose it. Since the Legislature rightfully granted Hawaii's naturopathic physicians prescriptive authority almost five years ago, there has been no evidence whatsoever of patient harm pertaining to these prescription rights brought to the naturopathic Board. There has also been no overuse of prescriptive authority, no cases of naturopathic physicians using it outside their training and scope of practice, and not one lawsuit filed in this regard. Instead, the public has benefited greatly from this prescriptive authority. The training of naturopathic physicians sufficiently prepares them for their prescription privileges, and they are highly qualified to offer all the services they currently provide, to the full extent of their licensed scope of practice, which is well defined. Standards of care have recently been adopted by the Board that provides oversight and clear criteria for the practice ofnaturopathic medicine in Hawaii. The restrictive requirements in SB2577 SDl have no precedent in other states where naturopathic physicians have prescriptive rights. Furthermore, the Hawaii naturopathic Board has set some of the highest standards in the US for the practice, safety, and competence of naturopathic physicians. Hawaii's naturopathic physicians have even taken the unusual step of voluntarily recommending that they complete 15 hours of continuing education in pharmacology biennially. One of the more misguided aspects of this bill is the proposal that naturopathic physicians would be required to have MDs review all of their prescriptions, including the amounts prescribed, and that these MDs would address any concerns they have with these prescriptions to the naturopathic physician and the board. This is an extremely ill-conceived proposal. A naturopathic physician is a very different type of medical expert than an MD. With all due respect, MDs are not at all equipped to make sensible reviews of naturopathic prescriptions, because their education has few, if any, requirements for training in the use of naturopathic treatment modalities. The education of my naturopathic physician far exceeded that of any MD in many areas essential to my health care. Naturopathic doctors are highly trained to be independent providers who consult with other health professionals when they consider it appropriate for the patient, not when required by law to subordinate their expertise to individuals untrained in naturopathic medicine. In addition, requiring one type of doctor to oversee and review a very different type of doctor's practice would create endless implementation and legal problems when it comes to issues such as insurance, patient privacy, HIP AA laws, and much more.

My naturopathic doctor's ability to write certain prescriptions when I need them, without the unreasonable restrictions proposed by SB2577 SD 1, is an important part of my health care. Though I live in New Jersey, my husband and I actually took a time-out from our honeymoon in Maui in May 2013 to meet with Dr. David Kem, the first naturopathic physician in Hawaii admitted to a state hospital medical staff. My husband has struggled with depression and anxiety, kidney stones, gout, and gastrointestinal issues that no MD has been able to connect the dots with thus far. We were seeking a naturopathic perspective, because the number of prescription drugs he has been given by M.D.s as temporary bandages is outrageous for a 33-year-old ... or anyone for that matter. Dr. Kem sat with my husband and me for 2 hours to discuss his case and offered us valuable advice and ideas about my husband's conditions we haven't heard elsewhere. I knew that naturopathic medicine would be a valuable resource for my husband, as I myself have been working with a naturopathic doctor since September 2010. SHE alone is responsible for helping me achieve the balance I was seeking with my hormonal and reproductive health, making it much more possible for us to conceive one day. This after I had sought help from an M.D., an endocrinologist, who told me that I would not ever be able to regulate my cycle enough to ultimately have a baby. Who wanted to prescribe me steroids or birth control pills, so he could get onto his next patient. As you can tell, I am personally extremely passionate about naturopathic medicine and naturopathic doctors ability to practice to their fullest capability. That said, there's no good reason for this bill, and every reason to oppose it. Since the Legislature rightfully granted Hawaii's naturopathic physicians prescriptive authority almost five years ago, there has been no evidence whatsoever of patient harm pertaining to these prescription rights brought to the naturopathic Board. There has also been no overuse of prescriptive authority, no cases of naturopathic physicians using it outside their training and scope of practice, and not one lawsuit filed in this regard. Instead, the public has benefitted greatly from this prescriptive authority. The training of naturopathic physicians sufficiently prepares them for their prescription privileges, and they are highly qualified to offer all the services they currently provide, to the full extent of their licensed scope of practice, which is well defined. Standards of care have recently been adopted by the Board that provide oversight and clear criteria for the practice of naturopathic medicine in Hawaii. The restrictive requirements in SB2577 SD 1 have no precedent in other states where naturopathic physicians have prescriptive rights. Furthermore, the Hawaii naturopathic Board has set some of the highest standards in the US for the practice, safety, and competence ofnaturopathic physicians. Hawaii's naturopathic physicians have even taken the unusual step of voluntarily recommending that they complete 15 hours of continuing education in pharmacology biennially. One of the more misguided aspects of this bill is the proposal that naturopathic physicians would be required to have MDs review all of their prescriptions, including the amounts prescribed, and that these MDs would address any concerns they have with these prescriptions to the naturopathic physician and the board. This is an extremely ill-conceived proposal. A naturopathic physician is a very different type of medical expert than an MD. With all due respect, MDs are not at all equipped to make sensible reviews of naturopathic prescriptions, because their education has few, if any, requirements for training in the use of naturopathic treatment modalities. The education of my naturopathic physician far exceeded that of any MD in many areas essential to my health care. Naturopathic doctors are highly trained to be independent providers who consult with other health professionals when they consider it appropriate for the patient, not when required by law to subordinate their expertise to individuals untrained in naturopathic medicine. In addition, requiring one type of doctor to oversee and review a very different type of doctor's practice would create endless implementation and legal problems when it comes to issues such as insurance, patient privacy, HIP AA laws, and much more. SB2577 SD I would also hinder naturopathic physicians and reduce their effectiveness by placing other unnecessary, inappropriate, and impractical burdens on their practices. These include the requirement that they submit detailed monthly reports of each item they prescribe to the board, the requirement that they receive authorization from the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs in order to prescribe any item from their own formulary, and the requirement that certain important prescription items, such as vaccines, medical oxygen, and some injectable medicines, be excluded from the naturopathic formulary. In some cases, requirements that SB2577 SDI would impose seem blatantly unfair, and may even be discriminatory, because no comparable requirements are placed on other types of physicians. If this bill is not stopped, it will undermine the high standards that the people of Hawaii have come to expect from naturopathic physicians. It will also reduce the quality of naturopathic care and the effectiveness of some of our most valued primary care providers, at a time when primary care physicians are already in short supply. The last thing we need is to turn back the clock on the prescriptive abilities of our naturopathic physicians. Please oppose SB2577 SDI and protect my access to the high level of naturopathic care that I deserve. Thank you, Maressa Brown I oppose the bill to limit naturopathic a current prescription writing abilities. Please keep the law as it is. Sincerely, Cheryl Cyman 89-725 Aina Jani pl. Captain cook, hi 96704 Sent from my iPhone To the Honorable Senator Rosalyn H. Baker, Chair, the Honorable Senator Brian T. Taniguchi, Vice Chair, and other Distinguished Members of the Senate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection: I'm writing to request that you oppose SB2577 SDl. This bill would restrict my naturopathic physician from being able to write prescriptions that are important in the health care of my family. Although naturopathic physicians try to minimize the use of prescription medications, in many cases they are essential to the practice of integrative family medicine. There is no rational basis for this legislation. Since the Legislature authorized prescriptive rights for Hawaii's naturopathic physicians, there have been: No complaints brought to the Hawaii State Naturopathic Board regarding prescriptive use by naturopathic physicians No cases of naturopathic physicians using prescriptions outside their training and scope of practice No overuse of prescriptive authority by naturopathic physicians No lawsuits filed in this regard Instead, the vast majority of the testimony already submitted regarding SB2577 shows that the public has benefitted greatly from this prescriptive authority. The training of naturopathic physicians sufficiently prepares them for their prescription privileges, and they are highly qualified to offer all the services they currently provide, to the full extent of their licensed scope of practice, which is well defined. Standards of care have recently been adopted by the Board that provide oversight and clear criteria for the practice of naturopathic medicine in Hawaii.

Please oppose SB2577 SDl and protect my access to the high level of naturopathic care that I deserve. Thank you, Ellie Miller Tht' mfonm1tion concern: I see a ND because my MD won't find the cause of my health issues; they just prescribe a prescription to lessen the symptoms, but the condition still exists. My ND prescribes medicine that helps to reverse the cause and therefore I am on a prescription for a short time instead of the rest of my life. NDs are very important part of health care. Not all of us want to see an MD for everything; they can't help with everything. I love my MD but I also love my ND and my acupuncturist and chiropractor. Between all 4 of them, I am healthier than I have ever been. I have the best of all 4. Please don't pass this bill as many patients like me may suffer. It will cause tension between the patient and MD for the care they desire. Thanks you. Nicole Gauthier A bill has been passed by the Hawaii Senate Health Committee that could seriously undermine your access to quality naturopathic care. The bill, SB2577 SD 1, would take away many of the rights gained in 2009 when several hundred patients submitted emails to lawmakers in support of efforts to improve Hawaii's naturopathic law. This overwhelming response played a crucial role in changing the law, and now you can take action again to protect your rights to naturopathic care. How the proposed bill could affect you: SB2577 SD 1 would hinder the practice of naturopathic medicine in numerous ways, preventing or impeding your naturopathic doctor's ability to write many prescriptions, and depriving you of other naturopathic care options that you currently have. This bill would also drastically change your personal relationship with your naturopathic physician by removing your right to have your naturopathic care be a private matter between just you and your doctor. It would require your naturopathic doctor to have an MD \"oversee\" your naturopathic care, including even the specific doses of your personal naturopathic prescriptions. This bill could even destroy your relationship with your doctor altogether, because the requirements in SB2577 SDl are so draconian that some naturopathic physicians could feel compelled to leave Hawaii if the bill passes. Your help is urgently needed to stop this bill and preserve your rights to the kind of naturopathic health care you deserve. Here's how you can take action and make a huge difference: please email messages opposing this bill to legislators at the address below. You can copy and paste the sample message that follows into an email. Add your name and address (and your name at the bottom), enter Oppose SB2577 SDl in the subject line, and send. For maximum effect, please modify and personalize the message -for example, add a story that shows how naturopathic medicine has helped you and why we need to expand, not shrink, the prescription abilities of naturopathic doctors. The sooner you send your message, the better. The deadline for sending your messages is 10:30 am this Wednesday, February 19th (24 hours prior to the bill's hearing). If you are receiving this email after the deadline, there's no urgent need to send a message, as decision-making on this bill will occur at the hearing. However, messages sent after the deadline but prior to the hearing are still included on the website as late testimony. Please let all your relatives and friends know about the damage this bill could do to your health care options, and rally their support to help us fight it. Forward this message to everyone you know, and ask them to spread the word and submit messages too. You don't need to be a Hawaii resident to make a difference; if people in other states submit emails, it will definitely help. We can't overstate the importance of getting as many people as possible to join you in sending messages opposing this bill. The future of your access to quality naturopathic care is at stake. Thank you for whatever you can do to help! \u00b7 Sincerely, (Each individual ND sending this message should sign here, and include all of what follows along with the message) Please email your messages to: CPNtestimony@capitol.hawaii.gov Your Name /Address February, 2014 Position: Strong Opposition to SB2577 SD 1 Relating to Naturopathic Physicians Hearing at 10:30 am on February 20th, 2014 in Conference Room 229 To the Honorable Senator Rosalyn H.

This is an extremely ill\u00ad conceived proposal. A naturopathic physician is a very different type of medical expert than an MD. With all due respect, MDs are not at all equipped to make sensible reviews of naturopathic prescriptions, because their education has few, if any, requirements for Lise' training in the use of naturopathic treatment modalities. The education of my naturopathic physician far exceeded that of any MD in many areas essential to my health care. Naturopathic doctors are highly trained to be independent providers who consult with other health professionals when they consider it appropriate for the patient, not when required by law to subordinate their expertise to individuals untrained in naturopathic medicine. In addition, requiring one type of doctor to oversee and review a very different type of doctor's practice would create endless implementation and legal problems when it comes to issues such as insurance, patient privacy, HIPAA laws, and much more. 882577 SD1 would also hinder naturopathic physicians and reduce their effectiveness by placing other unnecessary, inappropriate, and impractical burdens on their practices. These include the requirement that they submit detailed monthly reports of each item they prescribe to the board, the requirement that they receive authorization from the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs in order to prescribe any item from their own formulary, and the requirement that certain important prescription items, such as vaccines, medical oxygen, and some injectable medicines, be excluded from the naturopathic formulary. In some cases, requirements that 882577 SD1 would impose seem blatantly unfair, and may even be discriminatory, because no comparable requirements are placed on other types of physicians. If this bill is not stopped, it will undermine the high standards that the people of Hawaii have come to expect from naturopathic physicians. It will also reduce the quality of naturopathic care and the effectiveness of some of our most valued primary care providers, at a time when primary care physicians are already in short supply. The last thing we need is to turn back the clock on the prescriptive abilities of our naturopathic physicians. Please oppose 882577 SD1 and protect my access to the high level of naturopathic care that I deserve. Thank you for your time. Sincerely, Lise' D. Buell Omnia Pro Deo '-'------\\. & Development \"\"-Doctors Medical Attention: HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 27th Legislature 2014 HOUSE COMMITTEE OF CONSUMER PROTECTION & COMMERCE Re: HB2584- Relating to Personal Injury Protection Benefits Company Testimony We, Rx Development, fully support the utilization of In-Office Medication Dispensing for patients being treated for personal injuries as well as personal injury. These valuable services provide the personal attention and injury relief that they deserve by obtaining their medications at POC (Point of Care) and thereby, increasing patient compliance at all levels that extend beyond medications. Repackaged medications allow for physicians to safely and accurately dispense medication on a national basis and meet all state requirements for safety and reporting of medications being utilized. Bill HB2584 is a bill that we strongly oppose as it significantly limits the benefits listed above to patients to receive the care they seek out by the physician they trust with their appropriate and individualized treatment plan. The underlying premise that providers should not make a profit despite the added work, time and resources needed (e.g. treatment plans, depositions, appeals, court dates, denials, other documentation, etc.) to care for these patients that fall under these unfortunate circumstances is irrational. Traditional community pharmacies mark up the same medications up every day plus add more pressure by opening up their own clinics to compete with community physicians. Charges in-line with a community pharmacy, plus a modest dispensing fee to cover the costs associated is more than appropriate.

Baker, Chair, the Honorable Senator Brian T. Taniguchi, Vice Chair, and other Distinguished Members of the Senate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection: I am a certified holistic health coach and am writing to request that you do everything in your power to oppose SB2577 SDi. This bill would essentially require naturopathic physicians to restrict or give up prescription rights that are essential to their services. My naturopathic doctor's ability to write certain prescriptions when I need them, without the unreasonable restrictions proposed by SB2577 SD1, is an important part of my health care, and what has set Hawaii apart from many other states in our right to choose health care\u00b7 providers. There's no good reason for this bill, and every reason to oppose it. Since the Legislature rightfully granted Hawaii's naturopathic physicians prescriptive authority almost five years ago, there has been no evidence whatsoever of patient harm pertaining to these prescription rights brought to the naturopathic Board. There has also been no overuse of prescriptive authority, no cases of naturopathic physicians using it outside their training and scope of practice, and not one \u00b7 lawsuit filed in this regard. Instead, the public has benefited greatly from this prescriptive authority. The training of naturopathic physicians sufficiently prepares them for their prescription privileges, and they are highly qualified to offer all the services they currently provide, to the full extent of their licensed scope of practice, which is well defined. Standards of care have recently been adopted by the Board that provide oversight and clear criteria for the practice of naturopathic medicine in Hawaii. The restrictive requirements in SB2577 SD1 have no precedent in other states where naturopathic physicians have prescriptive rights. Furthermore, the Hawaii naturopathic Board has set some of the highest standards in the US for the practice, safety, and competence of naturopathic physicians. Hawaii's naturopathic physicians have even taken the unusual step of voluntarily recommending that they complete 15 hours of continuing education in pharmacology biennially.

I plan on returning to Hawaii to practice once I am finished with my training here. Our training with respect to Pharmacology, the training I have received, which is taught by an MD, is equal to and in some instances exceeds the hours of pharmacology that is taught at many MD/DO schools. The physicians that we train under regularly prescribe Pharmacological therapeutics under the same standard of care and guidelines as MD/DO's. It should be noted that the AMA brochure submitted by the Hawaii branch of the AMA does no comparison of MD/DO to ND hours with respect to Pharmacology. If this bill claims our training in not equal to MD/DO training, then isn't that a highly relevant comparison that should be made? In addition, MD/DO's are allowed to prescribe nutriceutical and botanical medicines, both of which can have fatal results when utilized improperly. Both of these disciplines are virtually non\u00ad existent in MD/DO curricula when compared to ND curricula. There is an extreme shortage of physicians in our state and in particular in the realm of primary care, the area in which most ND's practice. This bill is unrealistic, not feasible and discounts the extensive training that ND's receive. Most importantly, I strongly believe that this bill can and will have a significant negative impact on the people of Hawai'i.

In addition, requiring one type of doctor to oversee and review a very different type of doctor's practice would create endless implementation and legal problems when it comes to issues such as insurance, patient privacy, HIPAA laws, and much more. 562577 5D1 would also hinder naturopathic physicians and reduce their effectiveness by placing other unnecessary, inappropriate, and impractical burdens on their practices. These include the requirement that they submit detailed monthly reports of each item they prescribe to the board, the requirement that they receive authorization from the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs in order to prescribe any item from their own formulary, and the requirement that certain important prescription items, such as vaccines, medical oxygen, and parenteral therapy, be excluded from the naturopathic formulary. In some cases, requirements that 562577 5D1 would impose seem blatantly unfair, and may even be discriminatory, because no comparable requirements are placed on other types of physicians. If this bill is not stopped, it will undermine the high standards that the people of Hawaii have come to expect from naturopathic physicians. It will also reduce quality of naturopathic care and the effectiveness of some of our most valued primary care providers, at a time when primary care physicians are already in short supply. The last thing we need is to turn back the clock on the prescriptive abilities of our naturopathic physicians. Please oppose 562577 5D1 and protect my access to the high level of naturopathic care that I demand.

Baker. Chair, the Honorable Senator Brian T. Taniguchi. Vice Chair, and other Distinguished Members of the Senate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection: I'm writing to request that you do everything in your power to oppose SB2577 SDl. This bill would essentially require naturopathic physicians to restrict or give up prescription rights that are essential to their services. My naturopathic doctor's ability to write certain prescriptions when I need them, without the unreasonable restrictions proposed by SB2577 SDl, is an important part of my health care. There's no good reason for this bill, and every reason to oppose it. Since the Legislature rightfully granted Hawaii's naturopathic physicians prescriptive authority almost five years ago, there has been no evidence whatsoever of patient harm pertaining to these prescription rights brought to the naturopathic board. There has also been no overuse of prescriptive authority, no cases of naturopathic physicians using it outside their training and scope of practice, and not one lawsuit filed in this regard. Instead, the public has benefitted greatly from this prescriptive authority. The training of naturopathic physicians fully prepares them for their prescription privileges, and they are highly qualified to offer all the services they currently provide, to the full extent of their licensed scope of practice, which is well defined. Standards of care are already in place that provide oversight and clear criteria for the practice of naturopathic medicine in Hawaii. The restrictive requirements in SB2577 SDl have no precedent in other states where naturopathic physicians have earned prescriptive rights. Furthermore, the Hawaii naturopathic board has set some of the highest standards in the US for the practice, safety, and competence of naturopathic physicians. Hawaii's naturopathic physicians have even taken the unusual step of voluntarily recommending that they complete 15 hours of continuing education in pharmacology biennially. One of the more misguided aspects of this bill is the proposal that naturopathic physicians would be required to have MDs review all of their prescriptions, including the amounts prescribed, and that these MDs would address any concerns they have with these prescriptions to the naturopathic physician and the board. This is an extremely ill\u00ad conceived proposal. A naturopathic physician is a very different type of medical expert than an MD.

Thank you, Nik February 18, 2014 Position: Strong Opposition to SB2577 SDI Relating to Naturopathic Physicians Hearing at 10:30 am on February 20th, 2014 in Conference Room 229 To the Honorable Senator Rosalyn H. Baker, Chair, the Honorable Senator Briru1 T. Taniguchi, Vice Chair, and other Distinguished Members of the Senate Committee on Commerce and , Consumer Protection: I want to share with you, my personal story regarding naturopathic care. In July of2008, I was prescribed antibiotics from my M.D. to treat an eye infection. What followed, was 8 months of discomfort, sleeplessness, mental agony and medical visits. Upon taking the antibiotics, I became highly allergic to almost all foods. Everything I ate, or drank for that matter, resulted in me breaking out with hives over my entire body. After a couple of weeks of barely sustaining using over the counter Benadryl, I returned to my M.D. He sent me to an specialist to be tested for allergies. After weeks of testing, the allergist concluded I was allergic to a multitude of foods, grasses, nuts, etc. His only suggestion was for me to avoid everything I was allergic to. As weeks went by and my situation had not improved, I went back to my M.D once again. This time he sent me to a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist put me on antidepressants. As I told my friends \"I still have the hives, but I am happy about it.\" After several more weeks without improvement, the psychiatrist increased my dosage of antidepressants. I still have the hives, but, getting happier about them. More time passed without any improvements so the psychiatrist wanted to up my dosage again. Before she could up the dosage, I had to undergo a EKG to ensure my Q time was not too long. I don't know what that means, but I did not like the sounds of it. So under the psychiatrists guidance, I discontinued the antidepressants. More time passed. My days were fogged by the every four hour dosage ofBenadryl. My nights were spent sitting on the edge of a chair until I could not stay awake another moment, as anything in contact with my skin was unbearable. I was physically and mentally exhausted. In March of2009, my wife and I took a vacation to Kona, Hawaii. Still living on daily doses of Benadryl, I was less than exciting to be around. On one of our excursions, my wife came across Dr. Margaret Dexter, ND. My wife briefly explained my situation to Dr. Dexter. Reluctantly, I agreed to visit Dr. Dexter in her office. I am not, or was not, a believer in naturopathic medicine. However, my mind has been changed forever. Within, a couple of days, under Dr. Dexter's care, and a regimen ofprobiotics, the hives had completely disappeared. I was no longer having reactions to foods I ate or grasses, nuts, etc. Upon returning to California, I paid my M.D. a visit to tell him of the recovery and the role naturopathic medicine played in my recovery and re-entry into life. He dismissed my being cured as coincidental and the probiotics had no part in my healing. I assure you, this was not a coincident. IfSB2577 SDI passes and my M.D., or one like him, had to approve what Dr. Dexter prescribes, many patients will suffer needlessly, as my M.D. would. most likely not approve the prescription. I am writing to urge you oppose SB2577 SDl and allow all naturopathic doctors such as Dr. Margaret Dexter, ND to continue to provide the high quality of unimpeded naturopathic care to their patients. Thank you, Jeffrey L. Evans --------------- --------------------- ---Position: Strong Opposition to SB2577 SDl Relating to Naturopathic Physicians My Naturopathic Physician is by far the best doctor I have ever seen. I'm 37 years old. My husband is active duty in the United States Air Force, so I have seen many doctors on and off base from many different places. For about 20 years I have struggled and seen doctors for the same problem/illness. Treatment was usually always the same which didn't help with the real problem. I started to loose hope, until just a couple months ago, feeling desperate for relief, I decided to see a naturopathic physician. After being seen and treated by my naturopath, I finally feel relief! My problem/illness I struggled with for over 20 years is finally going away. My naturopathic doctor has found and addressed the real problem. This relief has also improved other important areas/relationships in my life. I feel the best I have ever felt, thanks to my naturopath's knowledge and training. Why interfere with or change something that works and is good? It would be TERRIBLE, absolutely awful ifSB2577 SDI was passed. Please oppose SB2577 SDl. Thank you for your time. Jenny Davis Hickam AFB Honolulu, HI #405-623-6906 To the Honorable Senator Rosalyn H. Baker, Chair, the Honorable Senator Brian T. Taniguchi, Vice Chair, and other Distinguished Members of the Senate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection: I'm writing to request that you do everything in your power to oppose SB2577 SDl. This bill would essentially require naturopathic physicians to restrict or give up prescription rights that are essential to their services. Naturopathic physicians are an essential part of the primary care workforce in Hawaii and have been serving Hawaii's citizens for over 30 years. Over the last 5 years, naturopathic physicians have had prescription rights and an exemplary track record of safety. Under SB2577 patients would have to see a second healthcare provider when a simple prescription like an antibiotic for a urinary tract infection is a required instead of handling it safety and simply with their naturopathic physician. This costs patients and the healthcare system more money and delays essential care. There's no good reason for this bill, and every reason to oppose it. Since the Legislature rightfully granted Hawaii's naturopathic physicians prescriptive authority almost five years ago, there has been no evidence whatsoever of patient harm pertaining to these prescription rights brought to the naturopathic Board. There has also been no overuse of prescriptive authority, no cases of naturopathic physicians using it outside their training and scope of practice, and not one lawsuit filed in this regard. Instead, the public has benefitted greatly from this prescriptive authority. The training of naturopathic physicians sufficiently prepares them for their prescription privileges, and they are highly qualified to offer all the services they currently provide, to the full extent of their licensed scope of practice, which is well defined. Standards of care have recently been adopted by the Board that provide oversight and clear criteria for the practice of naturopathic medicine in Hawaii.

In addition, requiring one type of doctor to oversee and review a very different type of doctor's practice would create endless implementation and legal problems when it comes to issues such as insurance, patient privacy, HIPAA laws, and much more. SB2577 SD1 would also hinder naturopathic physicians and reduce their effectiveness by placing other unnecessary, inappropriate, and impractical burdens on their practices. These include the requirement that they submit detailed monthly reports of each item they prescribe to the board, the requirement that they receive authorization from the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs in order to prescribe any item from their own formulary, and the requirement that certain important prescription items, such as vaccines, medical oxygen, and some injectable medicines, be excluded from the naturopathic formulary. In some cases, requirements that SB2577 SDl would impose seem blatantly unfair, and may even be discriminatory, because no comparable requirements are placed on other types of physicians. If this bill is not stopped, it will undermine the high standards that the people of Hawaii have come to expect from naturopathic physicians. It will also reduce the quality of naturopathic care and the effectiveness of some of our most valued primary care providers, at a time when primary care physicians are already in short supply. The last thing we need is to turn back the clock on the prescriptive abilities of our naturopathic physicians. Please oppose SB2577 SDl and protect access to the high level of naturopathic care that we deserve. Thank you, Sincerely, Kristin Stiles Green --------Debbie Chambrella 94-1042 Oli Loop Waipahu, HI 19, 2014 Position: Strong Opposition to SB2577 SDl Relating to Naturopathic Physicians Hearing at 10:30 am on February 20th, 2014 in Conference Room 229 To the Honorable Senator Rosalyn H. Baker, Chair, the Honorable Senator Brian T. Taniguchi, Vice Chair, and other Distinguished Members of the Senate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection: I'm writing to request that you do everything in your power to oppose SB2577 SDl. This bill would essentially require naturopathic physicians to restrict or give up prescription rights that are essential to their services. My naturopathic doctor's ability to write certain prescriptions when I need them, without the unreasonable restrictions proposed by SB2577 SDl, is an important part of my health care. There's no good reason for this bill, and every reason to oppose it. Since the Legislature rightfully granted Hawaii's naturopathic physicians prescriptive authority almost five years ago, there has been no evidence whatsoever of patient harm pertaining to these prescription rights brought to the naturopathic board. There has also been no overuse of prescriptive authority, no cases of naturopathic physicians using it outside their training and scope of practice, and not one lawsuit filed in this regard. Instead, the public has benefitted greatly from this prescriptive authority. The training of naturopathic physicians fully prepares them for their prescription privileges, and they are highly qualified to offer all the services they currently provide, to the full extent of their licensed scope of practice, which is well defined. Standards of care are already in place that provide oversight and clear criteria for the practice of naturopathic medicine in Hawaii. The restrictive requirements in SB2577 SDl have no precedent in other states where naturopathic physicians have earned prescriptive rights. Furthermore, the Hawaii naturopathic board has set some of the highest standards in the US for the practice, safety, and competence of naturopathic physicians. Hawaii's naturopathic physicians have even taken the unusual step of voluntarily recommending that they complete 15 hours of continuing education in pharmacology biennially. One of the more misguided aspects of this bill is the proposal that naturopathic physicians would be required to have MDs review all of their prescriptions, including the amounts prescribed, and that these MDs would address any concerns they have with these prescriptions to the naturopathic physician and the board. This is an extremely ill-conceived proposal. A naturopathic physician is a very different type of medical expert than an MD. With all due respect, MDs are not at all equipped to make sensible reviews of naturopathic prescriptions, because their education has few, if any, requirements for training in the use of naturopathic treatment modalities. The education of my naturopathic physician far exceeded that of any MD in many areas essential to my health care. Naturopathic doctors are highly trained to be independent providers who consult with other health professionals when they consider it appropriate for the patient, not when required by law to subordinate their expertise to individuals untrained in naturopathic medicine. In addition, requiring one type of doctor to oversee and review a very different type of doctor's practice would create endless implementation and legal problems when it comes to issues such as insurance, patient privacy, HIPAA laws, and much more.

These include the requirement that they submit detailed monthly reports of each item they prescribe to the board, the requirement that they receive authorization from the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs in order to prescribe any item from their own formulary, and the requirement that certain important prescription items, such as vaccines, medical oxygen, and parenteral therapy, be excluded from the naturopathic formulary. In some cases, requirements that SB2577 SDl would impose seem blatantly unfair, and may even be discriminatory, because no comparable requirements are placed on other types of physicians. If this bill is not stopped, it will undermine the high standards that the people of Hawaii have come to expect from naturopathic physicians.

Thank you, Debbie Chambrella My Position: Opposition to SB2577 SDI Relating to Naturopathic Physicians To Senator Rosalyn H. Baker, Chair, Senator Brian T. Taniguchi, Vice Chair, and other Distinguished Members of the Senate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection: I'm writing to voice very strong objections to SB2577 SDI. The Legislature received well over 300 emails opposing SB2577. and only three in support, yet the Committee Report (SB2577 SDI SSCR2244) seemed to ignore this, stating only that the committee \"received testimony in opposition to this measure from Sakoda Construction, LLC, and several individuals.\" Why was a second hearing scheduled when there was such overwhelming opposition to this bill? SB2577 SDI would require naturopathic physicians to unreasonably reduce their current prescription rights -integral to their services -and add unfair burdens to their practices. This bill is illogical, unnecessary, and clearly biased against the naturopathic profession. It seems intended to foster conflict rather than cooperation in Hawaii's integrative health care community, and it's based on faulty assumptions about the education ofnaturopathic physicians. For example, the Committee Report incorrectly states that the education of naturopathic physicians \"offers very few contact hours of study on pharmacological treatment of disease.\" In fact, the hours of pharmacology training for naturopathic physicians are nearly the same as that of MDs, and greater than that of osteopaths. There are so many problems with this bill that adequately describing them all would require dozens of pages of testimony. The following is a brief summary, beginning with its most egregious flaws. First, this bill essentially proposes that naturopathic physicians, in order to continue qualifying for the prescription privileges the legislature wisely granted them (with overwhelming public support) years ago, would be required to have MDs \"review\" all of their prescriptions. According to the bill, these MDs would then \"address any concerns\" with these prescriptions, including the actual amounts prescribed, to the naturopathic physician and the board. This is worse than illogical, because: I. The training of MDs does not at all qualify them for such a role. Allopathic education, compared to naturopathic education, has far fewer standards and requirements for training in the use of natural and preventive treatment modalities. SB2577 SD I reflects a misunderstanding of, or a disregard for, what a naturopathic physician is. The entire point ofnaturopathic physician's education and training is to become a distinctly different type of medical expert than an MD - one who is highly educated in an alternative system of medicine that differs in many ways from that of conventional allopathic physicians. MDs are not equipped by their training to provide a meaningful review of naturopathic prescriptions, or have a comprehensive understanding of the complex issues they involve. (In an attempt to defend the bill, the Committee Report states that \"naturopathic education differs from that received within allopathic or osteopathic medical schools.\" You cannot have it both ways; ifthe training is different, then it makes no sense for MDs to review naturopathic prescriptions.) 2. The extensive medical training of naturopathic physicians already more than qualifies them for their current prescription privileges. 3. Such a proposal is conspicuously one-sided and unfair. Is a corresponding requirement placed on MDs and other health care providers? Should MDs be required to have naturopathic physicians review and monitor all of their prescription activities, since the training of naturopathic physicians is much more extensive in many important areas (particularly those pertaining to a broad range of natural and preventive treatments) than that of MDs? 4. Appointing one type of physician to \"oversee\" another's jurisdiction raises all manner oflegal and ethical concerns. It would be terrible public policy to require one kind of doctor to answer to another kind of doctor, trained in a different form of medicine, in order to simply maintain the prescription rights they were trained to have, especially when other types of doctors enjoy corresponding rights with no such requirement. Some have questioned whether a proposal of this kind may be unconstitutional and discriminatory. It would also be highly impractical, as it raises numerous dilemmas regarding patient rights,insurance issues, patient confidentiality, and more. Second, this bill would require naturopathic physicians to submit monthly reports to the board detailing every single item they prescribe, and require the board to report this data to the legislature annually. Again, this is blatantly unfair, since no corresponding requirement is placed on other types of physicians. It is also impractical and cumbersome: it would place a completely unnecessary burden of paperwork on many of our most valuable primary care physicians -which Hawaii already has a shortage of. And SB2577 SD I would further hinder the prescription process by requiring naturopathic physicians to receive authorization from the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs in order to prescribe any item on their own formulary. Last but not least objectionable, SB2577 SDI would also place inappropriate and unreasonable limits on the naturopathic formulary by excluding such current prescription items as certain injectable medicines, vaccines, and medical oxygen. There's no logical reason why naturopathic physicians should be singled out for any of the above-mentioned excesses ofSB2577 SDl. To the contrary, since naturopathic physicians received prescriptive authority nearly five years ago, no evidence of patient harm regarding their prescription rights has been brought to the board, and there has been no overuse of prescriptive authority and not one lawsuit filed in this regard. In addition, the public has benefitted enormously as a result of the current prescriptive rights of naturopathic physicians; countless people have improved their health, and the public continues to overwhelmingly support those rights. Furthermore, in other states where naturopathic physicians have prescriptive rights there's no precedent for such restrictive requirements as those proposed in SB2577 SD I. In fact, the Hawaii board has already adopted standards of practice, care, competency, and safety for naturopathic physicians that are among the most rigorous in the nation. Hawaii's naturopathic physicians have even gone so far as to voluntarily recommend that they complete I 5 hours of continuing education bi-annually in pharmacology. (By the way, this is the ONLY portion of SB2577 SDI that is reasonable and should be proposed.) SB2577 SDI is a highly regressive proposal reflecting a failure to honor and understand an entire profession. It would reverse many positive gains that naturopathic physicians have rightfully achieved, and by reducing the effectiveness of many of our very best primary care doctors, have numerous negative consequences for the people of Hawaii. Thank you for your consideration of my testimony in strong opposition to this bill. Sincerely, Eddie Schott, I505 Kewalo St, #I03-A, Honolulu, HI 96822 My testimony against this bill is based on my 12-year association with Michaela Martin, ND, of Kamuela, on Hawaii Island. During these 12 years I have lost the services of FIVE HMSA primary care physicians. They left the island, moved on to Kaiser, retired, stopped taking insurance. Allopathic medicine on Hawaii Island has failed to provide any continuity of care, and I am often left without an MD, and forced again to begin the search for another practice to join. I am not alone with this problem. Many residents on this island often wind up in Emergency Rooms because they have no PCP. Urgent care centers are often prohibitively expensive: I once watched while a landscape worker, crippled by a large suppurating wound on his shin, left an urgent care center because he did not have insurance or $165 cash. You can bet he either died or found help at an ER, at a much greater cost to the state. WE DO NOT HA VE ENOUGH PHYSICIANS ON THIS ISLAND. Through all this Dr. Martin has provided both care continuity and treated me for many problems allopathic physicians were not able to address: acupuncture provides relief for chronic and debilitating sciatica. Dr. Martin diagnosed my diverticulitis when my physician ignored it, so that I could seek further treatment. And when MDs were throwing medications at me that directly resulted in osteopenia, Dr. Martin suggested alternatives and supplements that halted the progression. I have relied on Dr. Martin for prescriptions to treat cystitis and yeast infections, because waiting days or weeks for an MD appointment significantly increases the severity of both the infection and the symptoms. MDs on Hawaii Island are so overworked that the waiting period for a specialist appointment can exceed two months. In the meantime, our NDs keep us healthy with their advice and interventions. There have been no adverse incidents involving ND formulary rights in Hawaii. If you dismantle the prescriptive rights ofNDs, you will increase patient distress, escalate health care costs, overburden ERs, and roll back health care advances across the state, for no good reason.

(In an attempt to defend the bill, the Committee Report states that \"naturopathic education differs from that received within allopathic or osteopathic medical schools.\" You cannot have it both ways; ifthe training is different, then it makes no sense for MDs to review naturopathic prescriptions.) 2. The extensive medical training of naturopathic physicians already more than qualifies them for their current prescription privileges. 3. Such a proposal is conspicuously one-sided and unfair. Is a corresponding requirement placed on MDs and other health care providers? Should MDs be required to have naturopathic physicians review and monitor all of their prescription activities, since the training ofnaturopathic physicians is much more extensive in many important areas (particularly those pertaining to a broad range of natural and preventive treatments) than that of MDs? 4. Appointing one type of physician to \"oversee\" another's jurisdiction raises all manner of legal and ethical concerns. It would be terrible public policy to require one kind of doctor to answer to another kind of doctor, trained in a different form of medicine, in order to simply maintain the prescription rights they were trained to have, especially when other types of doctors enjoy corresponding rights with no such requirement. Some have questioned whether a proposal of this kind may be unconstitutional and discriminatory. It would also be highly impractical, as it raises numerous dilemmas regarding patient rights, insurance issues, patient confidentiality, and more. Second, this bill would require naturopathic physicians to submit monthly reports to the board detailing every single item they prescribe, and require the board to report this data to the legislature annually. Again, this is blatantly unfair, since no corresponding requirement is placed on other types of physicians. It is also impractical and cumbersome: it would place a completely unnecessary burden of paperwork on many of our most valuable primary care physicians -which Hawaii already has a shortage of. And SB2577 SDI would further hinder the prescription process by requiring naturopathic physicians to receive authorization from the Department of Commerce . and Consumer Affairs in order to prescribe any item on their own formulary. Last but not least objectionable, SB2577 SD I would also place inappropriate and unreasonable limits on the naturopathic formulary by excluding such current prescription items as certain injectable medicines, vaccines, and medical oxygen. There's no logical reason why naturopathic physicians should be singled out for any of the above\u00ad mentioned excesses of SB2577 SDI. To the contrary, since naturopathic physicians received prescriptive authority nearly five years ago, no evidence of patient harm regarding\u00b7their prescription rights has been brought to the board, and there has been no overuse of prescriptive authority and not one lawsuit filed in this regard. In addition, the public has benefitted enormously as a result of the current prescriptive rights ofnaturopathic physicians; countless people have improved their health, and the public continues to overwhelmingly support those rights. Furthermore, in other states where naturopathic physicians have prescriptive rights there's no precedent for such restrictive requirements as those proposed in SB2577 SD I. In fact, the Hawaii board has already adopted standards of practice, care, competency, and safety for naturopathic physicians that are among the most rigorous in the nation. Hawaii's naturopathic physicians have even gone so far as to voluntarily recommend that they complete 15 hours of continuing education bi-annually in pharmacology. (By the way, this is the ONLY portion of SB2577 SDI that is reasonable and should be proposed.) SB2577 SD I is a highly regressive proposal reflecting a failure to honor and understand an entire profession. It would reverse many positive gains that naturopathic physicians have rightfully achieved, and by reducing the effectiveness of many of our very best primary care doctors, have numerous negative consequences for the people of Hawaii. Thank you for your consideration of my testimony in strong opposition to this bill. Sincerely, February 15, 2014 My Position: Opposition to SB2577 SDl Relating to Naturopathic Physicians To Senator Rosalyn H. Baker, Chair, Senator Brian T. Taniguchi, Vice Chair, and other Distinguished Members of the Senate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection: I'm writing to voice very strong objections to SB2577 SDl. The Legislature received well over 300 emails opposing SB2577, and only three in support, yet the Committee Report (SB2577 SDI SSCR2244) seemed to ignore this, stating only that the committee \"received testimony in opposition to this measure from Sakoda Construction, LLC, and several individuals.\" Why was a second hearing scheduled when there was such overwhelming opposition to this bill? SB2577 SDl would require naturopathic physicians to unreasonably reduce their current prescription rights -integral to their services -and add unfair burdens to their practices. This bill is illogical, unnecessary, and clearly biased against the naturopathic profession. It seems intended to foster conflict rather than cooperation in Hawaii's integrative health care community, and it's based on faulty assumptions about the education of naturopathic physicians. For example, the Committee Report incorrectly states that the education of naturopathic physicians \"offers very few contact hours of study on pharmacological treatment of disease.\" In fact, the hours of pharmacology training for naturopathic physicians are nearly the same as that of MDs, and greater than that of osteopaths. There are so many problems with this bill that adequately describing them all would require dozens of pages of testimony. The following is a brief summary, beginning with its most egregious flaws. First, this bill essentially proposes that naturopathic physicians, in order to continue qualifying for the prescription privileges the legislature wisely granted them (with overwhelming public support) years ago, would be required to have MDs \"review\" all of their prescriptions. According to the bill, these MDs would then \"address any concerns\" with these prescriptions, including the actual amounts prescribed, to the naturopathic physician and the board. This is worse than illogical, because: 1. The training of MDs does not at all qualify them for such a role. Allopathic. education, compared to naturopathic education, has far fewer standards and requirements for training in the use of natural and preventive treatment modalities. SB2577 SD 1 reflects a misunderstanding of, or a disregard for, what a naturopathic physician is.

Thank you for your consideration of my testimony in strong opposition to this bill. Sincerely, Stephanie C.M. Doi Stephanie C.M. Doi 3741 Kanaina St. #345 Honolulu, HI 96815 February 15, 2014 My Position: Opposition to SB2577 SD1 Relating to Naturopathic Physicians To Senator Rosalyn H. Baker, Chair, Senator Brian T. Taniguchi, Vice Chair, and other Distinguished Members of the Senate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection: I'm writing to voice very strong objections to SB2577 SD1. The Legislature received well over 300 emails opposing SB2577, and only three in support, yet the Committee Report (SB2577 SD1 SSCR2244) seemed to ignore this, stating only that the committee \"received testimony in opposition to this measure from Sakoda Construction, LLC, and several individuals.\" Why was a second hearing scheduled when there was such overwhelming opposition to this bill? SB2577 SD1would require naturopathic physicians to unreasonably reduce their current prescription rights -integral to their services -and add unfair burdens to their practices. This bill is illogical, unnecessary, and clearly biased against the naturopathic profession. It seems intended to foster conflict rather than cooperation in Hawaii's integrative health care community, and it's based on faulty assumptions about the education of naturopathic physicians. For example, the Committee Report incorrectly states that the education of naturopathic physicians \"offers very few contact hours of study on pharmacological treatment of disease.\" In fact, the hours of pharmacology training for naturopathic physicians are nearly the same as that of MDs, and greater than that of osteopaths. There are so many problems with this bill that adequately describing them all would require dozens of pages of testimony. The following is a brief summary, beginning with its most egregious flaws. First, this bill essentially proposes that naturopathic physicians, in order to continue qualifying for the prescription privileges the legislature wisely granted them (with overwhelming public support) years ago, would be required to have MDs \"review\" all of their prescriptions. According to the bill, these MDs would then \"address any concerns\" with these prescriptions, including the actual amounts prescribed, to the naturopathic physician and the board. This is worse than illogical, because: 1. The training of MDs does not at all qualify them for such a role. Allopathic education, compared to naturopathic education, has far fewer standards and requirements for training in the use of natural and preventive treatment modalities. SB2577 SD1 reflects a misunderstanding of, or a disregard for, what a naturopathic physician is. The entire point of naturopathic physician's education and training is to become a distinctly different type of medical expert than an MD -one who is highly educated in an alternative system of medicine that differs in many ways from that of conventional allopathic physicians. MDs are not equipped by their training to provide a meaningful review of naturopathic prescriptions, or have a comprehensive understanding of the complex issues they involve. (In an attempt to defend the bill, the Committee Report states that \"naturopathic education differs from that received within allopathic or osteopathic medical schools.\" You cannot have it both ways; if the training is different, then it makes no sense for MDs to review naturopathic prescriptions.) 2. The extensive medical training of naturopathic physicians already more than qualifies them for their current prescription privileges. 3. Such a proposal is conspicuously one-sided and unfair. Is a corresponding requirement placed on MDs and other health care providers? Should MDs be required to have naturopathic physicians review and monitor all of their prescription activities, since the training of naturopathic physicians is much more extensive in many important areas (particularly those pertaining to a broad range of natural and preventive treatments) than that of MDs? 4. Appointing one type of physician to \"oversee\" another's jurisdiction raises all manner of legal and ethical concerns. It would be terrible public policy to require one kind of doctor to answer to another kind of doctor, trained in a different form of medicine, in order to simply maintain the prescription rights they were trained to have, especially when other types of doctors enjoy corresponding rights with no such requirement. Some have questioned whether a proposal of this kind may be unconstitutional and discriminatory. It would also be highly impractical, as it raises numerous dilemmas regarding patient rights, insurance issues, patient confidentiality, and more. Second, this bill would require naturopathic physicians to submit monthly reports to the board detailing every single item they prescribe, and require the board to report this data to the legislature annually. Again, this is blatantly unfair, since no corresponding requirement is placed on other types of physicians. It is also impractical and cumbersome: it would place a completely unnecessary burden of paperwork on many of our most valuable primary care physicians -which Hawaii already has a shortage of.

Without the help of my naturopath I would not be here today. The people of Hawaii deserve to have full access to naturopathic services which have proved to be extremely beneficial to thousands of us. I strongly urge you to oppose this measure. Thank you for your consideration of my testimony in strong opposition to this bill. Sincerely, Wendy K. Lang, registered voter 733 Honua Street Honolulu, HI 96816 Ph. 808-744-8699 2/15/2014 ---------- ------------ -------------------- Please do not pass this bill. It reflects a Jack of understanding and information regarding the education ofNaturopathic physicians. Please educate yourself concerning the education of these physicians before making a decision. Natural medicine has changed my life and given me my life back where allopathic physicians could not help me. The prescriptions given to me were invaluable to my recovery from an illness that allopathic medicine missed after I 0 years of seeking allopathic medicine for answers. Many, many people who came to the end of the help offered by allopathic medicine turned to a naturopath and found their answers and got their health back. Please do not limit these healers ability to prescribe medicines they deem necessary for their patients. Please educate yourself about this profession. It is unfairly portrayed by some who are ignorant of the present day profession and training and is unfoundedly feared by some in traditional medicine. It is simply a matter of looking at their training in pharmacology. Contact a Natural medicine University and learn about it before making a decision that could affect all of our freedoms to choose what type of physician we want to see.

Furthermore, in other states where naturopathic physicians have prescriptive rights there's no precedent for such restrictive requirements as those proposed in SB2577 SDI. In fact, the Hawaii board has already adopted standards of practice, care, competency, and safety for naturopathic physicians that are among the most rigorous in the nation. Hawaii's naturopathic physicians have even gone so far as to voluntarily recommend that they complete 15 hours of continuing education bi-annually in pharmacology. (By the way, this is the ONLY portion of SB2577 SDI that is reasonable and should be proposed.) SB2577 SDI is a highly regressive proposal reflecting a failure to honor and understand an entire profession. It would reverse many positive gains that naturopathic physicians have rightfully achieved, and by reducing the effectiveness of many of our very best primary care doctors, have numerous negative consequences for the people of Hawaii. Thank you for your consideration of my testimony in strong opposition to this bill. I am a patient of both allopathic and naturopahtic physicians and, have experienced a better standard of care from my naturopathic physician. I believe I should have the right to my choice of care without the government imposing one type of physician to oversee the other. I believe we have sufficient knowledge to make wise choices and I certainly don't feel that the allopathic physician provides a higher standard of care or knowledge than my naturopathic physician. To some degree, the allopathic physician is comparable to a drug pusher -this is ALWAYS their first course of action, albeit the \"drugs\" are considered legal. My allopathic physician is constantly URGING me to take this drug or the other when, in many instances, the \"cure\" is worse than the disease (e.g., the side effects of these so called wonder drugs). I sincerely hope the politicians that WE have voted into office give serious thought to this matter -taking into consideration the wishes of your constituents -as your decision will affect many of us. Sincerely, Cynthia C. Rillamas Kirsten Biondi PO Box 731 Kamuela, HI 96743-0731 February 16, 2014 My Position: Opposition to SB2577 SD 1 Relating to Naturopathic Physicians To Senator Rosalyn H. Baker, Chair, Senator Brian T. Taniguchi, Vice Chair, and other Distinguished Members of the Senate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection: I'm writing to voice very strong objections to SB2577 SD 1. The Legislature received well over 300 emails opposing SB2577, and only three in support, yet the Committee Report (SB2577 SDI SSCR2244) seemed to ignore this, stating only that the committee \"received testimony in opposition to this measure from Sakoda Construction, LLC, and several individuals.\" Why was a second hearing scheduled when there was such overwhelming opposition to this bill? SB2577 SD 1 would require naturopathic physicians to unreasonably reduce their current prescription rights -integral to their services -and add unfair burdens to their practices. This bill is illogical, unnecessary, and clearly biased against the naturopathic profession. It seems intended to foster conflict rather than cooperation in Hawaii's integrative health care community, and it's based on faulty assumptions about the education ofnaturopathic physicians. For example, the Committee Report incorrectly states that the education of naturopathic physicians \"offers very few contact hours of study on pharmacological treatment of disease.\" In fact, the hours of pharmacology training for naturopathic physicians are nearly the same as that of MDs, and greater than that of osteopaths. There are so many problems with this bill that adequately describing them all would require dozens of pages of testimony. The following is a brief summary, beginning with its most egregious flaws. First, this bill essentially proposes that naturopathic physicians, in order to continue qualifying for the prescription privileges the legislature wisely granted them (with overwhelming public support) years ago, would be required to have MDs \"review\" all of their prescriptions. According to the bill, these MDs would then \"address any concerns\" with these prescriptions, including the actual amounts prescribed, to the naturopathic physician and the board. This is worse than illogical, because: 1. The training of MDs does not at all qualify them for such a role. Allopathic education, compared to naturopathic education, has far fewer standards and requirements for training in the use of natural and preventive treatment modalities. SB2577 SD I reflects a misunderstanding of, or a disregard for, what a naturopathic physician is. The entire point ofnaturopathic physician's education and training is to become a distinctly different type of medical expert than an MD - one who is highly educated in an alternative system of medicine that differs in many ways from that of conventional allopathic physicians. MDs are not equipped by their training to provide a meaningful review of naturopathic prescriptions, or have a comprehensive understanding of the complex issues they involve. (In an attempt to defend the bill, the Committee Report states that \"naturopathic education differs from that received within allopathic or osteopathic medical schools.\" You cannot have it both ways; if the training is different, then it makes no sense for MDs to review naturopathic prescriptions.) 2. The extensive medical training of naturopathic physicians already more than qualifies them for their current prescription privileges. 3. Such a proposal is conspicuously one-sided and unfair. Is a corresponding requirement placed on MDs and other health care providers? Should MDs be required to have naturopathic physicians review and monitor all of their prescription activities, since the training of naturopathic physicians is much more extensive in many important areas (particularly those pertaining to a broad range of natural and preventive treatments) than that of MDs? 4. Appointing one type of physician to \"oversee\" another's jurisdiction raises all manner oflegal and ethical concerns. It would be terrible public policy to require one kind of doctor to answer to another kind of doctor, trained in a different form of medicine, in order to simply maintain the prescription rights they were trained to have, especially when other types of doctors enjoy corresponding rights with no such requirement. Some have questioned whether a proposal of this kind may be unconstitutional and discriminatory. It would also be highly impractical, as it raises numerous dilemmas regarding patient rights, insurance issues, patient confidentiality, and more. Second, this bill would require naturopathic physicians to submit monthly reports to the board detailing every single item they prescribe, and require the board to report this data to the legislature annually. Again, this is blatantly unfair, since no corresponding requirement is placed on other types of physicians. It is also impractical and cumbersome: it would place a completely unnecessary burden of paperwork on many of our most valuable primary care physicians -which Hawaii already has a shortage of. And SB2577 SD I would further hinder the prescription process by requiring naturopathic physicians to receive authorization from the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs in order to prescribe any item on their own formulary. Last but not least objectionable, SB2577 SDI would also place inappropriate and unreasonable limits on the naturopathic formulary by excluding such current prescription items as certain injectable medicines, vaccines, and medical oxygen. There's no logical reason why naturopathic physicians should be singled out for any of the above-mentioned excesses of SB2577 SDI. To the contrary, since naturopathic physicians received prescriptive authority nearly five years ago, no evidence of patient harm regarding their prescription rights has been brought to the board, and there has been no overuse of prescriptive authority and not one lawsuit filed in this regard.

It would reverse many positive gains that naturopathic physicians have rightfully achieved, and by reducing the effectiveness of many of our very best primary care doctors, have numerous negative consequences for the people of Hawaii, myself included. Thank you for your consideration of my testimony in strong opposition to this bill. Sincerely, Judy Self 521 Hahaione St 7J Honolulu, HI Montgomery 958 Kailiu Place Honolulu, Hawaii February 15, 2014 My Position: Opposition to SB2577 SDl Relating to Naturopathic Physicians To Senator Rosalyn H. Baker, Chair, Senator Brian T. Taniguchi, Vice Chair, and other Distinguished Members of the Senate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection: I'm writing to voice very strong objections to SB2577 SD 1. The Legislature received well over 300 emails opposing SB2577, and only three in support, yet the Committee Report (SB2577 SDl SSCR2244) seemed to ignore this, stating only that the committee \"received testimony in opposition to this measure from Sakoda Construction, LLC, and several individuals.\" Why was a second hearing scheduled when there was such overwhelming opposition to this bill? SB2577 SD 1 would require naturopathic physicians to unreasonably reduce their current prescription rights -integral to their services -and add unfair burdens to their practices. This bill is illogical, unnecessary, and clearly biased against the naturopathic profession. It seems intended to foster conflict rather than cooperation in Hawaii's integrative health care community, and it's based on faulty assumptions about the education ofnaturopathic physicians. For example, the Committee Report incorrectly states that the education of naturopathic physicians \"offers very few contact hours of study on pharmacological treatment of disease.\" In fact, the hours of pharmacology training for naturopathic physicians are nearly the same as that ofMDs, and greater than that of osteopaths. There are so many problems with this bill that adequately describing them all would require dozens of pages of testimony. The following is a brief summary, beginning with its most egregious flaws. First, this bill essentially proposes that naturopathic physicians, in order to continue qualifying for the prescription privileges the legislature wisely granted them (with overwhelming public support) years ago, would be required to have MDs \"review\" all of their prescriptions. According to the bill, these MDs would then \"address any concerns\" with these prescriptions, including the actual amounts prescribed, to the naturopathic physician and the board. This is worse than illogical, because: I. The training of MDs does not at all qualify them for such a role. Allopathic education, compared to naturopathic education, has far fewer standards and requirements for training in the use of natural and preventive treatment modalities. SB2577 SD I reflects a misunderstanding of, or a disregard for, what a naturopathic physician is. The entire point ofnaturopathic physician's education and training is to become a distinctly different type of medical expert than an MD - one who is highly educated in an alternative system of medicine that differs in many ways from that of conventional allopathic physicians. MDs are not equipped by their training to provide a meaningful review ofnaturopathic prescriptions, or have a comprehensive understanding of the complex issues they involve. (In an attempt to defend the bill, the Committee Report states that \"naturopathic education differs from that received within allopathic or osteopathic medical schools.\" You carmot have it both ways; ifthe training is different, then it makes no sense for MDs to review naturopathic prescriptions.) 2. The extensive medical training of naturopathic physicians already more than qualifies them for their current prescription privileges. 3. Such a proposal is conspicuously one-sided and unfair. Is a corresponding requirement placed on MDs and other health care providers? Should MDs be required to have naturopathic physicians review and monitor all of their prescription activities, since the training of naturopathic physicians is much more extensive in many important areas (particularly those pertaining to a broad range of natural and preventive treatments) than that of MDs? 4. Appointing one type of physician to \"oversee\" another's jurisdiction raises all manner of legal and ethical concerns. It would be terrible public policy to require one kind of doctor to answer to another kind of doctor, trained in a different form of medicine, in order to simply maintain the prescription rights they were trained to have, especially when other types of doctors enjoy corresponding rights with no such requirement. Some have questioned whether a proposal of this kind may be unconstitutional and discriminatory. It would also be highly impractical, as it raises numerous dilemmas regarding patient rights, insurance issues, patient confidentiality, and more. Second, this bill would require naturopathic physicians to submit monthly reports to the board detailing every single item they prescribe, and require the board to r.eport this data to the legislature annually. Again, this is blatantly unfair, since no corresponding requirement is placed on other types of physicians. It is also impractical and cumbersome: it would place a completely unnecessary burden of paperwork on many of our most valuable primary care physicians -which Hawaii already has a shortage of. And SB2577 SD 1 would further hinder the prescription process by requiring naturopathic physicians to receive authorization from the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs in order to prescribe any item on their own formulary. Last but not least objectionable, SB2577 SDl would also place inappropriate and unreasonable limits on the naturopathic formulary by excluding such current prescription items as certain injectable medicines, vaccines, and medical oxygen. There's no logical reason why naturopathic physicians should be singled out for any of the above-mentioned excesses of SB2577 SDI. To the contrary, since naturopathic physicians received prescriptive authority nearly five years ago, no evidence of patient harm regarding their prescription rights has been brought to the board, and there has been no overuse of prescriptive authority and not one lawsuit filed in this regard. In addition, the public has benefitted enormously as a result of the current prescriptive rights ofnaturopathic physicians; countless people have improved their health, and the public continues to overwhelmingly support those rights. Furthermore, in other states where naturopathic physicians have prescriptive rights there's no precedent for such restrictive requirements as those proposed in SB2577 SD 1. In fact, the Hawaii board has already adopted standards of practice, care, competency, and safety for naturopathic physicians that are among the most rigorous in the nation. Hawaii's naturopathic physicians have even gone so far as to voluntarily recommend that they complete 15 hours of continuing education bi-annually in pharmacology. (By the way, this is the ONLY portion of SB2577 SDI that is reasonable and should be proposed.) SB2577 SDl is a highly regressive proposal reflecting a failure to honor and understand an entire profession.

Thank you for your consideration of my testimony in strong opposition to this bill. Sincerely, To Whom it may concern, I was born and raised with Naturopathic medicine. As a child I remember my mother educating us about healthy eating, healthy thinking, healthy living. I have grown to live by this for myself and my own family now. Over the years I have watched Naturopathic physicians develope and meet the needs of the new millenia. There are four accredited naturopathic schools in this country. The science around natural health and well being is on the rise in the world. Internationally we will be considered slow and backward if this bill passes. For myself, my children, my community, my beloved state of Hawaii please think again and measure carefully all the current information surrounding Naturopathic medicine and it's successes without a biased view. Over time the state of Hawaii will change drastically. The health and wellbeing of your people, and quality of life will diminish. Every educated person on the planet knows that Healthy Eating, Healthy Thinking, Healthy Living is one of the most important corner stones for a healthy, peaceful society. I have personal, testimonials, but I will spare you that. But I will reiterate, ALL INTELLIGENT NATIONS HONOR AND RESPECT NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE. THEY DEVOTE FUNDING TO SUPPORT THE SCIENCE AROUND THE CONSISTENT DEVELOPMENT OF NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE. WE WILL BE CONSIDERED A BACKWARD NATION IF YOU GO FORWARD WITH THIS BILL.

Baker, Chair, Senator Brian T. Taniguchi, Vice Chair, and other Distinguished Members of the Senate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection: I urge you to oppose SB2577 SDI. I am aware that many others have in the past given testimony detailing the reasons why this is not a good bill. I would like to say that the Committee Report is at times untruthful and misleading. I am not aware of any great problems naturopaths have caused operating as they do now, so why make a law that adds unneeded bureaucratic actions and makes it harder for people to receive care, when the state already has an MD shortage. Aloha Eileen Peppard 1602 Kanalui Street Honolulu, HI 96816 February 16, 2014 Position: Strong Opposition to SB2577 SD 1 Relating to N aturopathic Physicians Hearing at 10:30 am on February 20th, 2014 in Conference Room 229 To the Honorable Senator Rosalyn H. Baker, Chair, the Honorable Senator Brian T. Taniguchi, Vice Chair, and other Distinguished Members of the Senate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection: I'm writing to request that you do everything in your power to oppose SB2577 SD I. This bill would essentially require naturopathic physicians to restrict or give up prescription rights that are essential to their services. My naturopathic doctor's ability to write certain prescriptions when I need them, without the unreasonable restrictions proposed by SB2577 SD 1, is an important part of my health care. There's no good reason for this bill, and every reason to oppose it. Since the Legislature rightfully granted Hawaii's naturopathic physicians prescriptive authority almost five years ago, there has been no evidence whatsoever of patient harm pertaining to these prescription rights brought to the naturopathic board. There has also been no overuse of prescriptive authority, no cases of naturopathic physicians using it outside their training and scope of practice, and not one lawsuit filed in this regard. Instead, the public has benefitted greatly from this prescriptive authority. The training ofnaturopathic physicians fully prepares them for their prescription privileges, and they are highly qualified to offer all the services they currently provide, to the full extent of their licensed scope of practice, which is well defined. Standards of care are already in place that provides oversight and clear criteria for the practice of naturopathic medicine in Hawaii. The restrictive requirements in SB2577 SDl have no precedent in other states where naturopathic physicians have earned prescriptive rights. Furthermore, the Hawaii naturopathic board has set some of the highest standards in the US for the practice, safety, and competence of naturopathic physicians. Hawaii's naturopathic physicians have even taken the unusual step of voluntarily recommending that they complete 15 hours of continuing education in pharmacology biennially. ----------------One of the more misguided aspects of this bill is the proposal that naturopathic physicians would be required to have MDs review all of their prescriptions, including the amounts prescribed, and that these MDs would address any concerns they have with these prescriptions to the naturopathic physician and the board. This is an extremely ill-conceived proposal. A naturopathic physician is a very different type of medical expert than an MD. With all due respect, MDs are not at all equipped to make sensible reviews of naturopathic prescriptions, because their education has few, if any, requirements for training in the use of naturopathic treatment modalities. The education of my naturopathic physician far exceeded that of any MD in many areas essential to my health care. Naturopathic doctors are highly trained to be independent providers who consult with other health professionals when they consider it appropriate for the patient, not when required by law to subordinate their expertise to individuals untrained in naturopathic medicine. In addition, requiring one type of doctor to oversee and review a very different type of doctor's practice would create endless implementation and legal problems when it comes to issues such as insurance, patient privacy, HIPAA laws, and much more. SB2577 SD I would also hinder naturopathic physicians and reduce their effectiveness by placing other unnecessary, inappropriate, and impractical burdens on their practices. These include the requirement that they submit detailed monthly reports of each item they prescribe to the board, the requirement that they receive authorization from the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs in order to prescribe any item from their own formulary, and the requirement that certain important prescription items, such as vaccines, medical oxygen, and parenteral therapy, be excluded from the naturopathic formulary. In some cases, requirements that SB2577 SDI would impose seem blatantly unfair, and may even be discriminatory, because no comparable requirements are placed on other types of physicians. If this bill is not stopped, it will undermine the high standards that the people of Hawaii have come to expect from naturopathic physicians. It will also reduce quality of naturopathic care and the effectiveness of some of our most valued primary care providers, at a time when primary care physicians are already in short supply. The last thing we need is to tum back the clock on the prescriptive abilities of our naturopathic physicians. Please oppose SB2577 SD 1 and protect my access to the high level of naturopathic care that I demand. Ironically, I sought the advice of a naturopathic doctor because my primary care physician is too quick to pull out the prescription pad. I was seeking an approach that would solve the problem rather than mask the symptoms with a pharmaceutical (a situation which allows a cascade of problems to occur down the line). I am very happy with solution she helped me find by changing my diet. I fully trust her knowledge-base and prudence when it comes to providing prescriptions when really needed. Thank you for your time and consideration.

First, this bill essentially proposes that naturopathic physicians, in order to continue qualifying for the prescription privileges the legislatur(( wisely granted them (with overwhelming public support) years ago, would be required to have MDs \"review\" all of their prescriptions. According to the bill, these MDs would then \"address any concerns\" with these prescriptions, including the actual amounts prescribed, to the naturopathic physician and the board. This is worse than illogical, because: I. The training of MDs does not at all qualify them for such a role. Allopathic education, compared to naturopathic education, has far fewer standards and requirements for training in the use of natural and preventive treatment modalities. SB2577 SDI reflects a misunderstanding of, or a disregard for, what a naturopathic physician is. The entire point ofnaturopathic physician's education and training is to become a distinctly different type of medical expert than an MD - one who is highly educated in an alternative system of medicine that differs in many ways from that of conventional allopathic physicians. MDs are not equipped by their training to provide a meaningful review of naturopathic prescriptions, or have a comprehensive understanding of the complex issues they involve. (In an attempt to defend the bill, the Committee Report states that \"naturopathic education differs from that received within allopathic or osteopathic medical schools.\" You cannot have it both ways; if the training is different, then it makes no sense for MDs to review naturopathic prescriptions.) 2. The extensive medical training of naturopathic physicians already more than qualifies them for their current prescription privileges. 3. Such a proposal is conspicuously one-sided and unfair. Is a corresponding requirement placed on MDs and other health care providers? Should MDs be required to have naturopathic physicians review and monitor all of their prescription activities, since the training of naturopathic physicians is much more extensive in many important areas (particularly those pertaining to a broad range of natural and preventive treatments) than that ofMDs? 4. Appointing one type of physician to \"oversee\" another's jurisdiction raises all manner oflegal and ethical concerns. It would be terrible public policy to require one kind of doctor to answer to another kind of doctor, trained in a different form of medicine, in order to simply maintain the prescription rights they were trained to have, especially when other types of doctors enjoy corresponding rights with no such requirement. Some have questioned whether a proposal of this kind may be unconstitutional and discriminatory. It would also be highly impractical, as it raises numerous dilemmas regarding patient rights, insurance issues, patient confidentiality, and more. Second, this bill would require naturopathic physicians to submit monthly reports to the board detailing every single item they prescribe, and require the board to report this data to the legislature annually. Again, this is blatantly unfair, since no corresponding requirement is placed on other types of physicians. It is also impractical and cumbersome: it would place a completely unnecessary burden of paperwork on many of our most valuable primary care physicians -which Hawaii already has a shortage of. And SB2577 SDI would further hinder the prescription process by requiring naturopathic physicians to receive authorization from the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs in order to prescribe any item on their own forrnulary. Last but not least objectionable, SB2577 SDI would also place inappropriate and unreasonable limits on the naturopathic forrnulary by excluding such current prescription items as certain injectable medicines, vaccines, and medical oxygen. There's no logical reason why naturopathic physicians should be singled out for any of the above-mentioned excesses ofSB2577 SDI. To the contrary, since naturopathic physicians received prescriptive authority nearly five years ago, no evidence of patient harm regarding their prescription rights has been brought to the board, and there has been no overuse of prescriptive authority and not one lawsuit filed in this regard. In addition, the public has benefited enormously as a result of the current prescriptive rights ofnaturopathic physicians; countless people have improved their health, and the public continues to overwhelmingly support those rights. Furthermore, in other states where naturopathic physicians have prescriptive rights there's no precedent for such restrictive requirements as those proposed in SB2577 SDI. In fact, the Hawaii board has already adopted standards of practice, care, competency, and safety for naturopathic physicians that are among the most rigorous in the nation. Hawaii's naturopathic physicians have even gone so far as to voluntarily recommend that they complete IS hours of continuing education bi-annually in pharmacology. (By the way, this is the ONLY portion of SB2577 SDI that is reasonable and should be proposed.) SB2577 SD I is a highly regressive proposal reflecting a failure to honor and understand an entire profession. It would reverse many positive gains that naturopathic physicians have rightfully\u00b7 achieved, and by reducing the effectiveness of many of our very best primary care doctors, have numerous negative consequences for the people of Hawaii. Thank you for your consideration of my testimony in strong opposition to this bill. Sincerely, Dr. William Thornton To Senator Rosalyn H. Baker, Chair, Senator Brian T.

The Legislature received well over 300 emails opposing SB2577, and only three in support, yet the Committee Report (SB2577 SDl SSCR2244) seemed to ignore this, stating only that the committee \"received testimony in opposition to this measure from Sakoda Construction, LLC, and several individuals.\" Why was a second hearing scheduled when there was such overwhelming opposition to this bill?

Thank you for your consideration of my testimony in strong opposition to this bill. Sincerely, Sheryl Shook, PhD 3038 Woolsey Place Honolulu, HI 96822 Yoko Tomita I PO Box 11810, Honolulu, Hawaii 96828 February 16, 2014 -- --------~- Position: Strong Opposition to SB2577 SD1 Relating to Naturopathic Physicians Hearing at 10:30 am on February 20th, 2014 in Conference Room 229 To the Honorable Senator Rosalyn H. Baker, Chair, the Honorable Senator Brian T. Taniguchi, Vice Chair, and other Distinguished Members of the Senate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection: I'm writing to request that you do everything in your power to oppose SB2577 SD1. This bill would essentially require naturopathic physicians to restrict or give up prescription rights that are essential to their services. My naturopathic doctor's ability to write certain prescriptions when I need them, without the unreasonable restrictions proposed by SB2577 SD1, is an important part of my health care. There's no good reason for this bill, and every reason to oppose it. Since the Legislature rightfully granted Hawaii's naturopathic physicians prescriptive authority almost five years ago, there has been no evidence whatsoever of patient harm pertaining to these prescription rights brought to the naturopathic board. There has also been no overuse of prescriptive authority, no cases of naturopathic physicians using it outside their training and scope of practice, and not one lawsuit filed in this regard. Instead, the public has benefitted greatly from this prescriptive authority. The training of naturopathic physicians fully prepares them for their prescription privileges, and they are highly qualified to offer all the services they currently provide, to the full extent of their licensed scope of practice, which is well defined. Standards of care are already in place, which provide oversight and clear criteria for the practice of naturopathic medicine in Hawaii. The restrictive requirements in SB2577 SD1 have no precedent in other states where naturopathic physicians have earned prescriptive rights. Furthermore, the Hawaii naturopathic board has set some of the highest standards in the US for the practice, safety, and competence of naturopathic physicians. Hawaii's naturopathic physicians have even taken the unusual step of voluntarily recommending that they complete 15 hours of continuing education in pharmacology biennially. One of the more misguided aspects of this bill is the proposal that naturopathic physicians would be required to have MDs review all of their prescriptions, including the amounts prescribed, and that these MDs would address any concerns they have with these prescriptions to the naturopathic physician and the board. This is an extremely ill-conceived proposal. A naturopathic physician is a very different type of medical expert than an MD. With all due respect, MDs are not at all equipped to make sensible reviews of naturopathic prescriptions, because their education has few, if any, requirements for training in the use of naturopathic treatment modalities. The education of my naturopathic physician far exceeded that of any MD in many areas essential to my health care. Naturopathic doctors are highly trained to be independent providers who consult with other health professionals when they consider it appropriate for the patient, not when required by law to subordinate their expertise to individuals untrained in naturopathic medicine. In addition, requiring one type of doctor to oversee and review a very different type of doctor's practice would create endless implementation and legal problems when it comes to issues such as insurance, patient privacy, HIPAA laws, and much more. SB2577 SD1 would also hinder naturopathic physicians and reduce their effectiveness by placing other unnecessary, inappropriate, and impractical burdens on their practices. These include the requirement that they submit detailed monthly reports of each item they prescribe to the board, the requirement that they receive authorization from the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs in order to prescribe any item from their own formulary, and the requirement that certain important prescription items, such as vaccines, medical oxygen, and parenteral therapy, be excluded from the naturopathic formulary. In some cases, requirements that SB2577 SD1 would impose seem blatantly unfair, and may even be discriminatory, because no comparable requirements are placed on other types of physicians. If this bill is not stopped, it will undermine the high standards that the people of Hawaii have come to expect from naturopathic physicians. It will also reduce quality of naturopathic care and the effectiveness of some of our most valued primary care providers, at a time when primary care physicians are already in short supply. The last thing we need is to turn back the clock on the prescriptive abilities of our naturopathic physicians. Please oppose SB2577 SD1 and protect my access to the high level of naturopathic care that I demand. Thank you, Yoko Tomita Diana L. Salansky 94-533 Lumiauau Street Waipahu, 16, 20I4 My Position: Opposition to SB2577 SDI Relating to Naturopathic Physicians To Senator Rosalyn H. Baker, Chair, Senator Brian T. Taniguchi, Vice Chair, and other Distinguished Members of the Senate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection: I'm writing to voice very strong objections to SB2577 SDl. The Legislature received well over 300 emails opposing SB2577, and only three in support, yet the Committee Report (SB2577 SDI SSCR2244) seemed to ignore this, stating only that the committee \"received testimony in opposition to this measure from Sakoda Construction, LLC, and several individuals.\" Why was a second hearing scheduled when there was such overwhelming opposition to this bill? SB2577 SD 1 would require naturopathic physicians to unreasonably reduce their current prescription rights -integral to their services -and add unfair burdens to their practices. This bill is illogical, unnecessary, and clearly biased against the naturopathic profession. It seems intended to foster conflict rather than cooperation in Hawaii's integrative health care community, and it's based on faulty assumptions about the education of naturopathic physicians. For example, the Committee Report incorrectly states that the education of naturopathic physicians \"offers very few contact hours of study on pharmacological treatment of disease.\" In fact, the hours of pharmacology training for naturopathic physicians are nearly the same as that ofMDs, and greater than that of osteopaths. There are so many problems with this bill that adequately describing them all would require dozens of pages of testimony. The following is a brief summary, beginning with its most egregious flaws. First, this bill essentially proposes that naturopathic physicians, in order to continue qualifying for the prescription privileges the legislature wisely granted them (with overwhelming public support) years ago, would be required to have MDs \"review\" all of their prescriptions. According to the bill, these MDs would then \"address any concerns\" with these prescriptions, including the actual amounts prescribed, to the naturopathic physician and the board. This is worse than illogical, because: 1. The training of MDs does not at all qualify them for such a role. Allopathic education, compared to naturopathic education, has far fewer standards and requirements for training in the use of natural and preventive treatment modalities. SB2577 SDl reflects a misunderstanding of, or a disregard for, what a naturopathic physician is. The entire point ofnaturopathic physician's education and training is to become a distinctly different type of medical expert than an MD - one who is highly educated in an alternative system of medicine that differs in many ways from that of conventional allopathic physicians. MDs are not equipped by their training to provide a meaningful review of naturopathic prescriptions, or have a comprehensive understanding of the complex issues they involve. (In an attempt to defend the bill, the Committee Report states that \"naturopathic education differs from that received within allopathic or osteopathic medical schools.\" You cannot have it both ways; if the training is different, then it makes no sense for MDs to review naturopathic prescriptions.) 2. The extensive medical training of naturopathic physicians already more than qualifies them for their current prescription privileges. 3. Such a proposal is conspicuously one-sided and unfair. Is a corresponding requirement placed on MDs and other health care providers? Should MDs be required to have naturopathic physicians review and monitor all of their prescription activities, since the training of naturopathic physicians is much more extensive in many important areas (particularly those pertaining to a broad range of natural and preventive treatments) than that ofMDs? 4. Appointing one type of physician to \"oversee\" another's jurisdiction raises all manner oflegal and ethical concerns. It would be terrible public policy to require one kind of doctor to answer to another kind of doctor, trained in a different form of medicine, in order to simply maintain the prescription rights they were trained to have, especially when other types of doctors enjoy corresponding rights with no such requirement. Some have questioned whether a proposal of this kind may be unconstitutional and discriminatory. It would also be highly impractical, as it raises numerous dilemmas regarding patient rights,insurance issues, patient confidentiality, and more. Second, this bill would require naturopathic physicians to submit monthly reports to the board detailing every single item they prescribe, and require the board to report this data to the legislature annually. Again, this is blatantly unfair, since no corresponding requirement is placed on other types of physicians. It is also impractical and cumbersome: it would place a completely unnecessary burden of paperwork on many of our most valuable primary care physicians -which Hawaii already has a shortage of. And SB2577 SD 1 would further hinder the prescription process by requiring naturopathic physicians to receive authorization from the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs in order to prescribe any item on their own formulary. Last but not least objectionable, SB2577 SDl would also place inappropriate and unreasonable limits on the naturopathic formulary by excluding such current prescription items as certain injectable medicines, vaccines, and medical oxygen. There's no logical reason why naturopathic physicians should be singled out for any of the above-mentioned excesses of SB2577 SDl. To the contrary, since naturopathic physicians received prescriptive authority nearly five years ago, no evidence of patient harm regarding their prescription rights has been brought to the board, and there has been no overuse of prescriptive authority and not one lawsuit filed in this regard. In addition, the public has benefited enormously as a result of the current prescriptive rights of naturopathic physicians; countless people have improved their health, and the public continues to overwhelmingly support those rights. Furthermore, in other states where naturopathic physicians have prescriptive rights there's no precedent for such restrictive requirements as those proposed in SB2577 SDl. In fact, the Hawaii board has already adopted standards of practice, care, competency, and safety for naturopathic physicians that are among the most rigorous in the nation. Hawaii's naturopathic physicians have even gone so far as to voluntarily recommend that they complete 15 hours of continuing education bi-annually in pharmacology. (By the way, this is the ONLY portion of SB2577 SD 1 that is reasonable and should be proposed.) SB2577 SDl is a highly regressive proposal reflecting a failure to honor and understand an entire profession. It would reverse many positive gains that naturopathic physicians have rightfully achieved, and by reducing the effectiveness of many of our very best primary care doctors, have numerous negative consequences for the people of Hawaii. Thank you for your consideration of my testimony in strong opposition to this bill. My personal testimony: Dr. Coles has helped me tremendously with adrenal fatigue that included lack of energy and sleepless nights. Also, I have found relief from migraine headaches along with numerous other issues that could not be explained by western medicine.

Taniguchi, Vice Chair, and other Distinguished Members of the Senate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection and Senator Mike Gabbard: We've added the form letter below as we agree with each and every point it makes. However, we feel strongly that we must add to the input -if you will hear it. As we indicated when we first contacted you on this matter, we receive far better care from our Naturopahtic Doctor (ND) than from any of the many MDs we've consulted with over the last several years. Again, NDs (here and on the mainland) explore and treat causes illuminated by symptoms whereas MDs routinely treat solely based on test results. MDs perform well when directed by tests, NDs perform well with and without them. We've encountered multiple MDs that told us they did not have time to adequately treat the complex health issues one of us presented. Not one time have we gotten that response from the NDs visited. Currently, patients have the option to seek help where it can best be provided, often one in support of the other -MD or ND leading where they best serve the patient and supporting the other when required. So, we must ask you: I. What systematic issues were brought to you in regards to ND care that you must address? 2. Are those sources special interest groups or citizens? 3. Where are the calls for change from your constituents -if any, where are they posted so we other citizens can inform ourselves and take appropriate action? 4. Does the source of this bill have a conflict of interest in this matter? Any of you? -If you are a MD, that answer must be yes. 5. Have there been any -just one -scientific survey/study to support the proposed changes in this bill? If not, what's the real issue here? 6. Why are you attempting to reduce our health care options when costs are increasing and viable options are diminishing (do we not already have an MD shortage that's projected to worsen in the coming years)? How does this help? 7. Why are you not listening to the overwhelming support ofNDs? 8. Who are you truly supporting on this matter, citizens or special interests? To Senator Rosalyn H. Baker, Chair, Senator Brian T. Taniguchi, Vice Chair, and other Distinguished Members of the Senate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection: I'm writing to voice very strong objections to SB2577 SDI.

Sincerely, Stan Williams & Sue Kurowski sswilski@gmail.com 808-672-6380 HST February 16, 2014 From: Dr. Laurie Steelsmith, N .D., L.Ac. Steelsmith Natural Health Center 438 Hobron Lane, Suite 314 Honolulu, HI 96815 To: Senator Rosalyn H. Baker, Chair, Senator Brian T. Taniguchi, Vice Chair, and other Distinguished Members of the Senate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection Testimony Position: Opposition to SB2577 SDl Relating to Naturopathic Physicians Dear Honorable Senator Rosalyn Baker, Honorable Senator Brian Taniguchi, and Distinguished Members of the Committee, I am writing to request that you strongly oppose SB2577 SDI relating to naturopathic physicians. I have held naturopathic licenses in the state of Hawaii and the state of Washington for. over 20 years, and practiced naturopathic medicine in Hawaii since 1993. This bill has no grounds for reducing the naturopathic formulary, or requiring that licensed naturopathic physicians submit to reviews by MDs in order to prescribe medicines that naturopathic physicians have been highly trained to administer to their patients. This would severely limit our prescriptive authority and undermine our ability to care for patients according to our training. Naturopathic doctors are experts in addressing numerous conditions that are often overlooked or pooriy understood by MDs, because naturopathic doctors have extensive training in many areas of preventive and naturopathic medicine that MDs have little or no training in. I am an independent primary care provider who is licensed to diagnose and treat disease and consult with other practitioners when I consider it best for the patient. A law that forces me to consult with any other practitioner every time I write a prescription would be extremely unreasonable, inappropriate, and restrictive to my practice. In addition, the requirement that naturopathic doctors obtain reviews for their prescriptions by doctors not educated in naturopathic medicine has many glaring shortcomings from a legal perspective, considering the complexities of malpractice insurance and patient privacy issues. Nearly five years ago the legislature wisely granted naturopathic physicians the right to prescribe pharmaceutical medicines within the full scope of our practice. Since then there has not been a single complaint to the board, and not one instance of disciplinary action taken, regarding these prescription rights. And during this time many thousands of people in Hawaii have seen. naturopathic physicians and improved their health in numerous ways. Because naturopathic doctors are highly focused on creating health rather than on prescribing medicines that suppress symptoms, as a rule they are among the very safest and most cautious practitioners when it comes to prescribing pharmaceutical agents. Some pharmaceutical treatments, as our current law rightfully acknowledges, are integral to the training and practice of naturopathic physicians. For example, we are experts in prescribing such items as bio-identical hormones, natural thyroid hormone replacement, and intravenous nutritional therapies. These and other prescription medicines in the Hawaii naturopathic formulary, administered according to our well-established scope of practice, can profoundly increase the quality of patients' lives. Removing any components of our naturopathic formulary would be a detriment to the people of Hawaii. For the record, naturopathic doctors have had prescription rights for 20 years in Washington State. This bill would put Hawaii's naturopathic law back many years compared to the laws in Washington, Utah, Arizona, Oregon, and other states. Our Hawaii Board has adopted standards of care that provide oversight for the practice of naturopathic medicine, and the Board recommends that all naturopathic physicians in Hawaii receive 15 continuing education credits or more in pharmacology biennially. Naturopathic doctors are thoroughly trained physicians who practice according to rigorous standards of education taught at accredited naturopathic medical schools. In order to have a naturopathic medical license, we are required to pass national board exams, recognized by the State of Hawaii, which cover the full scope of our training and qualify us to safely and effectively prescribe appropriate pharmaceutical medications. Please oppose SB2577 SDI and keep our Hawaii naturopathic law, with our current prescription rights, intact. Thank you, Dr. Laurie Steelsmith, N.D., L.Ac.

Thank you for your consideration of my testimony in strong opposition to this bill. Sincerely, Lenore L Ogawa ---------------- - -February 16, 2014 My Position: Opposition to 582577 SD! Relating to Naturopathic Physicians Dear Senator Rosalyn H. Baker, Chair, Senator Brian T. Taniguchi, Vice Chair, and other Distinguished Members of the Senate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection: On behalf of myself and my many patients who benefit greatly from naturopathic care I write you with very strong objections to SB2577 SD!. Naturopathic physicians have proved to be competent practitioners and to have an important role in healthcare in Hawaii. Time and time again patients write in support of the care they have received and our history proves our safety. Since the expanded scope of practice in 2009 there have been no reports filed against NDs for prescribing issues. In fact, NDs across the country have a stellar record of prescription safety. Excerpt from the California Bureau of Naturopathic Medicine, January 2007 Report -In preparation for this report, the Bureau contacted the licensing agencies for each of the states that allow NDs to prescribe. None of the states reported any patient harm or disciplinary action due to ND prescribing. In addition, the states were not aware of any civil actions against NDs for prescribing.
