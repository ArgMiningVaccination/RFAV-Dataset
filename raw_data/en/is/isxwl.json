Painting the Energy Body Signs and Symbols for Vibrational Healing [Petra Neumayer](https://www.simonandschuster.com/authors/Petra-Neumayer/410052451)and [Roswitha Stark](https://www.simonandschuster.com/authors/Roswitha-Stark/410052453) Table of Contents About The Book Explains how to make symbols directly on areas of pain for quick relief, on bandages to speed healing, and on acupressure points for energy and emotional work Explores the use of symbols to reduce scar tissue, counteract electromagnetic pollution, balance the chakras, and cleanse toxins from the body Details how to transfer the energy of a symbol to water, food, jewelry, or stones for long-term treatment and prevention Geometric symbols and signs have been drawn on the body to enhance strength and courage and stimulate the body's powers of self-healing since prehistoric times--the most ancient evidence being the 5,000-year-old iceman \"\u00d6tzi,\" found in the Alps in 1991, who had symbols tattooed over his arthritic joints. Found in indigenous societies around the globe, symbols on the body--whether drawn, painted, or tattooed--act as energy antennae, triggering healing impulses in the energy body and meridian system. Exploring several simple methods to work with symbols for physical, emotional, and spiritual healing, Petra Neumayer and Roswitha Stark illustrate the key symbols used in this practice and reveal how to select the proper symbol or symbols for your condition. They explain how to use these signs directly on areas of pain and injury--from mosquito bites to eczema--for quick relief, on bandages to speed healing, and on acupressure points and meridians to treat more complex conditions. They explore the use of symbols to reduce scar tissue, counteract electromagnetic pollution, balance the chakras, and cleanse toxins from the body. The authors explain how, like homeopathic remedies, symbols transfer information through energetic vibration and morphic fields\u2014the resonance between all living things, past and present, discovered by Cambridge biologist Rupert Sheldrake. They detail how to transfer the energy of a symbol to water, food, jewelry, or stones for long-term treatment and prevention. They also show how to heal animals and plants with symbols. Bringing together traditional Chinese medicine, quantum physics, dowsing, and homeopathy, this new yet ancient practice harnesses the power of symbols to initiate healing at the very foundation of our energetic being. Excerpt Healing with Geometric Signs and Symbols The use of geometric signs and symbols to alter energy vibrations is no invention of modern times. Symbols have played a big role in all cultures as they are the transmitters of energetic messages in condensed form. If symbols are, for example, painted on the skin then this can alter the vibrations in the energy field of a person or the flow of energy along the meridians according to the placement and type of sign involved. Body illustrations are used all around the globe, from the South Seas to Africa to India. In spite of divisions of time and space and without the possibility of contact between the different peoples, many cultures made use of similar symbols--for example, several parallel lines. For some people work with symbols may be thought of negatively. This rejection occurs most frequently in European latitudes. Because the clergy in the Middle Ages tried to eliminate most traditions by means of the Inquisition and witch trials, our cultural sphere missed out on about five hundred years of direct sensory experience with symbols. Healing with geometric signs has nothing to do with sorcery or magic. It is much more a matter of using the long-lost knowledge of our ancestors. Sensory work with symbols is experiencing a renaissance. Kinesthesiologists use different symbols to restore patients' lost balance or to reduce stress. Other analogous situations also indicate how beneficially symbols can influence our reality. C. G. Jung clearly illustrated with his theory of the collective unconscious that symbolic material in the morphic field is stored in archetypal figures or mandalas. A symbol (Greek symbolon = \"connection\") is therefore also a visible sign that can help us with its connective power to effect a wholesome vibration between that which provides the form (sickness, pain) and the rarified level (vibrations that influence us)--that is, between matter and consciousness. HEALING SYMBOLS It was Erich K\u00f6rbler who rediscovered the underlying pattern behind all symbols of the most varied cultures on the basis of electronics and chaos theory: one to nine parallel lines, the equilateral cross that can be constructed from these lines, the upsilon life rune, and the sinus forms. Now let's discuss each of these individual symbols, or barcodes. In the following sections you will learn how new homeopathy works with these signs and how you can test which sign should be used in which case by using a single-handed divining rod or tensor. SINUS THE SYMBOL OF REVERSAL The sinus sign is always a symbol of change or reversal. It transforms unwholesome information into wholesome--and the reverse as well; therefore this sign should be used with care. For example, if this sign is used too long, the positive can be reversed back to the negative. The sinus sign is useful in manifold ways, not only on the body by painting it directly on the skin but also for redirecting all sorts of unwholesome information (disorders, illnesses, negative beliefs, etc.). THE LIFE RUNE, UPSILON STRENGTHENING The Y is a much used sign that in contrast to the sinus sign always works in a positive way: unwholesome information is changed into wholesome information and wholesome information remains wholesome and is strengthened. Use is frequently made of this characteristic in informing water to strengthen a positive affirmation. The upsilon is seldom used on the body itself. THE EQUILATERAL CROSS FOR CLEANSING LIVING SPACE The equilateral cross was used in every ancient culture, and it is known as a Christian symbol. By shifting the horizontal beam upward it becomes the Passion Cross, or Cross of Suffering. But only the equilateral primitive Christian cross-form works in an energetically positive and shielding manner. The protective characteristic of the equilateral cross has even been noticed by real estate insurers in Switzerland. They have observed that houses that have windows decorated with equilateral crosses have less chance of being burglarized. In informational medicine the equilateral cross mainly finds use in the cleansing of living space--for example, to free water veins or geopathic zones from interference. It has a protective effect: unwholesome radiation may still be present, but the body no longer reacts negatively to it. CASE STUDY Geometric Signs for Lacerations and Burns Petra S. came to me with a severe laceration. She accidentally cut herself between the lower and middle joints of her middle finger. The wound was about 5 mm long and 3 mm deep and caused severe pain and throbbing. I put an adhesive bandage on the finger and with energetic testing determined that the injury was a disturbance of degree 7 (see chapter 4). I painted a 2-line sinus sign on the bandage. Directly after the application Petra reported that the throbbing pain had eased. Again, according to the energetic testing, I determined that the bandage should be worn for seven days. I recommended that Petra draw the symbol on the bandage herself when she changed the dressing during this time. After ten days she showed me her finger and reported a practically pain-free course of healing. The piece of skin that had been removed was completely restored. Four weeks later the laceration was fully healed and there was no scar.

Readers will appreciate the authors' stories of successfully clearing mosquitos away, reducing aches and pains, and minimizing negative effects from electrosmog. I love the instructions provided for transferring healing symbols into drinking water, and clearing allergies. I highly recommend this book to anyone seriously interested in alternative healing or homeopathy.\" - Reality Shifters, August 2013 \"I love the way this book shows how nature includes many of the all-purpose healing symbols, and trees for example will counter various energy problems in their environments by exhibiting exactly the same symbols recommended for such problems (such as water flowing under).
