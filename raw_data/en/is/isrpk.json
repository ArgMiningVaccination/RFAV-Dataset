What started out as a routine flu strain selection meet-ing ended up being part of the answer to why federal healthagencies urged Americans to get vaccinated with a flu vaccinethat did not protect against the most serious flu strain domi-nating the US flu season in 2003-2004. A review of the FDA meeting transcript shows that there was little disagreement about selection of the first two strains offlu. The majority of the Committee concluded that the 2003-2004 flu vaccine should include A/Caledonia and B/HongKong, which were both in the previous year's vaccine.However, selection of the third strain was more difficultbecause there was strong evidence that a genetically mutatedtype A flu, known as A/Fujian, was emerging out of Asia andcausing significant complications, including death. The focus of the Committee's deliberations centered on the fact that epidemiological intelligence indicated that a mutatedA/Fujian strain was rapidly moving from Asia through Europeand into Hawaii and the west coast of the US. Preliminaryreports suggested that the close relative, A/Panama flu strain,present in the 2002-2003 flu vaccine formulation had little orno effect on A/Fujian. In fact, FDA and CDC flu expertsrepeatedly told the Committee that A/Fujian had two geneticmutations and was different enough from A/Panama thatA/Panama may only offer minimal cross protection, if any. At the February 20 FDA meeting, Nancy Cox, Ph.D., Chief, Influenza Branch, Centers for Disease Control (CDC), stated,\"H3N2 viruses with amino acid changes at both 155 and 156in site B (A/Fujian) tend to be poorly inhibited by antibodiesto the vaccine virus, and low-reacting viruses with thesechanges have been detected in Asia, Europe and the Americas.I should also probably mention that our colleagues in the UKhave similar findings in that at the WHO CollaboratingCenter in London they found that the most recent virusesthat they had received from Europe are really quite poorlyinhibited by antiserum to the Panama virus.\" (Cox was refer-ring to the fact that the A/Panama vaccine would be ineffec- tive in preventing the mutated A/Fujian strain of flu.) As a result, the FDA Committee voted to defer the selection of the third flu strain until the WHO had made their recom-mendation three weeks later. When the Committee recon-vened by phone on March 18, they learned that the WHOhad decided to stay with A/Panama even though there wasevidence that A/Fujian's two genetic mutations was prevent-ing A/Panama from having much effect. When pressed, fed-eral officials admitted that labs around the world were havingtrouble isolating and growing A/Fujian in eggs in a way thatwould allow mass vaccine production. Knowing that it takesabout six months to ramp up flu vaccine production everyyear and concerned that further delay in strain selectionwould prevent a flu vaccine from being made available to thepublic by the fall, the majority of the Committee voted to goahead and include A/Panama in the 2003-2004 flu vaccine. 2 The March 18, 2003, VRBPAC meeting was the last forNVIC President, Barbara Loe Fisher, who had served on theCommittee as the consumer voting member since 1999. Shechose to abstain from the strain selection vote, saying, \"I feeluncomfortable voting for inclusion of an A/Panama-likevirus, when what may really be needed is an A/Fujian-likevirus. So I am going to abstain and urge that the public beinformed that next year's flu vaccine may not be protectiveagainst an emerging strain.\" At the earlier February 20 meeting, Fisher questioned whether there were follow-up of cases of flu every year to determine ifthe vaccine was effective. Dr. Cox of the CDC answered,\"There is no systematic follow-up to see, to documentwhether the general population who receives a flu vaccine isinfected by a flu virus because it's an impossible task. I meanwe have 80 million doses or 70 million doses given and itwould be impossible to follow-up.\" Dr. Cox also pointed outthat only about 20 percent of all flu-like illnesses are actuallydue to an influenza virus. \"There are many other pathogensthat cause respiratory illness,\" she said. CDC Says All Children Should Get Flu Vaccine For decades, flu vaccine has only been recommended for thoseover 65 years old and anyone with a medical condition whichplaces them at risk for suffering severe complications from theflu. However, in recent years the CDC has lowered the age tothose over 50 3and, in 2002, began to move toward recom-mending universal use of a flu vaccine in all healthy children more than 6 months of age.4The CDC currently encourages two doses of flu vaccine for all healthy children 6 to 23months of age for first-time vaccinees and an annual flu shotafter that. 5(In March 2003, influenza vaccine was incorpo- rated into the Vaccines for Children program which providesfederally-funded vaccines to poor and uninsured children.) 6 In April 2003, as it did in 2002, the Advisory Committee onImmunization Practices (ACIP) of the CDC stated that\"because young, otherwise healthy children are at increasedrisk for influenza-related hospitalizations, the ACIP continuesto encourage influenza vaccination of children 6-23 monthsof age when feasible.\" However, ACIP goes on to state that it\"did not make a full recommendation for annual vaccinationof this group because of several concerns that must beaddressed before such a recommendation could be made.These concerns include increasing efforts to educate parentsand providers regarding the impact of influenza....\" 5 FDA Approves Live Nasal Flu Vaccine Up until June 2003, the only flu vaccine that has been used inthe US for the past three decades has been a killed or inactivat-ed flu vaccine that is injected into the arm. However, on June 17,2003, the FDA approved the first live virus flu vaccine, which isalso the first vaccine designed to be sprayed up the nose. 7 FluMist is manufactured by MedImmune Vaccines and dis-tributed by Wyeth Vaccines and both companies investedheavily in the novel vaccine which they hoped would take overthe majority of the flu vaccine market currently dominated byAventis-Pasteur and Evans Vaccines, Ltd., makers of the killedflu vaccine. (MedImmune reportedly paid $1.5 billion in2002 to acquire Aviron, 8which invented the live nasal flu vaccine. Wyeth had been a major producer of killed flu vac-cine in the US but stopped making it in order to invest in andconcentrate on FluMist.) 9 When the FDA licensed FluMist in the summer of 2003, it lim-ited its approval to use only in healthy persons between 5 and 49years of age, even though most severe complications and deathsoccur in those under 2 or over 65 who suffer from chronic ill-ness. The vaccine's most common side effects in pre-licensureclinical trials included flu symptoms (fever, runny nose, cough,body aches) and the vaccine is specifically not recommended forpeople with asthma or respiratory diseases because it worsenedthose conditions in clinical trials. Also, because it is a live virusvaccine and can transmit live flu vaccine virus to the immune-compromised, those persons coming into close contact withimmune-compromised individuals cannot take the vaccine.FluMist is also contraindicated for pregnant women. 10 The previous year, when the FDA's Vaccines and RelatedBiological Products Advisory Committee met on December20, 2002, to vote on whether FluMist should be licensed,NVIC's Fisher voted \"No\" on the question of whetherMedImmune had proved safety. 11She said: \"The data are inadequate to support the safety of FluMist for individuals five to 64 years of age. The increased risk of asth-ma in young children and the increased risk for some children in these studies for upper respiratory infections, musculoskele-tal pain, otitis media and croup, as well as upper respiratorysymptoms in adults, suggests that an unknown number ofhealthy, but perhaps genetically vulnerable individuals, acrossall age groups will not be able to handle this vaccine well, andthis will, over the long term, also lead to the public perceptionthat when you get the flu vaccine, you get the flu. 11 \"...The fact that live vaccine flu virus is shed in 80 percent ofrecipients poses an additional risk for our population at large,particularly for immune compromised individuals across allage groups. The outstanding questions about the true rate oftransmission of vaccine strain viruses among children needs tobe clarified, as does the retention of the attenuation of theshed viruses and the high frequency of nucleotide changes.Because this live virus nasal vaccine is not indicated for highrisk health groups, which have historically been the targetedpopulations to receive the flu vaccine, it's a very serious step tomove to the use of a live virus vaccine for the majority ofhealthy individuals, and a standard for proof of safety must bevery high. I don't think that standard has yet been met by thedata which have been presented so far.\" 11 MedImmune and Wyeth Launch Ad Campaign In the late summer of 2003, MedImmune and Wyethlaunched the beginning of a three-year $100 million media adcampaign targeting the potentially huge market of nearly 160million Americans who are healthy and fall between the agesof 5 and 49. 12The CDC estimates that only 13 percent of healthy people under 50, or about 17 million people, get flushots every year. 13Unlike the killed flu vaccine, which retails for about $15, FluMist would cost consumers between $46and $150 a dose. 14 On September 10, 2003, MedImmune and Wyethannounced that Wal-Mart stores would offer FluMist. 15 MedImmune's stock went up that day, reportedly havinggained 48 percent in the previous 12 months. A MedImmunesenior vice president said, \"With the availability of FluMist atWal-Mart pharmacies, healthy people will now have easieraccess to the first-available nasal flu vaccine while they areshopping in Wal-Mart stores.\" It looked like FluMist waspoised to be a blockbuster with MedImmune officials andsome financial analysts predicting that FluMist would gener-ate between $120 million and $140 million in sales. 16 CDC Urges Widespread Use of Flu Vaccine On September 23, the CDC held a press conference to pro-mote mass vaccination with flu vaccine. 17\"People have failed to appreciate how important and serious a disease influenzareally is,\" CDC head Julie Gerberding said. Another doctoradded, \"It is the single leading cause of death from any vac-cine-preventable disease.\" 17 The head of the CDC's National Immunization Program,Walter Orenstein, M.D., reported that the flu season which hadjust ended in Australia, New Zealand and other parts of thewestern hemisphere was \"moderately severe\" and was dominat- The National Vaccine Information Center Page 2 The Vaccine Reaction nSpring 2004ed by influenza A, which was \"covered\" in the vaccine being used this year. Emphasis was placed on encouraging healthy childrento get vaccinated, as well as traditionally high-risk groups such asthe elderly and those with chronic illnesses such as diabetes. IOM Says Flu Shots for Children Need More Study On October 6, the Institute of Medicine (IOM), National Academy of Sciences, released a report that said there is weakevidence that flu vaccine triggers neurological disorders. 18 However, the IOM Immunization Safety Review Committeealso made it clear that inconsistencies in the scientific data andmethodological problems with studies published so far pre-vented a more definitive conclusion. The Committee agreed that there was a causal relationship between the 1976 swine flu vaccine and the paralytic disorderGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome in vaccinated adults but that themajority of studies since do not link Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndromewith flu vaccines. The Committee also said the \"evidencefavors a rejection of a causal relationship between influenzavaccines and relapse of multiple sclerosis in adults.\" However, the Committee cautioned that before federal offi- cials recommend annual flu vaccinations for young children,the CDC should increase its monitoring, detection and eval-uation of flu vaccine neurological complications. TheCommittee's chair was quoted as saying, \"Because flu vac-cines are so widely used in adults, the possibility that neuro-logical disorders might be related to vaccines must be givenserious consideration.\" FluMist Sales are Sluggish On October 17, Wal-Mart announced it would not sellFluMist in its stores because several state pharmacy boardsraised questions about the legal ability of Wal-Mart's pharma-cists to administer the vaccine. 19MedImmune's stock started to fall by the middle of the afternoon. By the end of October, it became apparent that relatively few of the four million doses of FluMist that MedImmune hadproduced were being purchased by hospitals, clinics or doc-tor's offices. High cost, lack of insurance coverage, the needto keep FluMist frozen at all times, and people wary of safe-ty concerns about squirting live flu virus up the nose were allcited as reasons. Health care workers, fresh from their vaccine risk lesson with live smallpox vaccine virus transmission, rejected FluMistbecause of concerns about spreading the vaccine virus toimmune compromised patients. 20Some hospitals advised those who had used FluMist recently to avoid coming to thehospital to visit sick patients. 21 Fujian Flu Hits the US In November 2003, the media began reporting that a partic-ularly nasty kind of flu was being seen in Texas andColorado. 22The CDC responded by issuing statements urg- ing everyone to get their flu shots, with CDC director, JulieGerberding, M.D. saying, \"This is very serious,\" and pointing out that 36,000 flu-related deaths occur every year.23The year before, the CDC stated, \"Epidemics of influenza typicallyoccur during the winter months and are responsible for anaverage of approximately 20,000 deaths.\" 4 By early December, the media was reporting the flu-relateddeaths of several children. One 20-month old Colorado boy,whose death was widely reported, had been vaccinated. 24 What followed was an explosion of publicity around the coun-try about a possible severe flu epidemic and a higher-than-usual number of deaths, especially in children. There was a runon the inactivated, injectable flu vaccine and spot shortagesbegan to be reported. 25Part of the reason for the shortage became apparent when it was revealed that the two manufac-turers of killed flu vaccine had cut their combined productionof doses to about 83 million down from some 95 million. Thiswas in response to the fact that at the end of 2002, about 12million unused doses of flu vaccine had to be discarded eventhough during the 2002 flu season, the CDC had heavily pro-moted the idea that every American over 50 should get a flushot and had encouraged healthy children to get vaccinated. 26 But this year, with intense media coverage and a stream of state-ments from the CDC reporting flu deaths and pneumonia com-plications, the CDC had more success in convincing Americansthat it was a good idea to get a flu shot. Predicting that the num-ber of flu deaths could double to \"70,000\" this year, 27 publichealth officials admitted the current flu vaccine was not an exactmatch with the circulating strain but asserted that the vaccine\"was a very close match\" and would offer \"cross protection.\" 27 Soon it became clear that a record number of adults and chil-dren were literally running to doctors and clinics to get vacci-nated. MedImmune and Wyeth, seeing an opportunity tocapitalize on the publicity, sent out a press release onDecember 5, 2003, claiming that its live virus nasal vaccinewas more effective at preventing the current strain of flu thatwas circulating than the inactivated flu vaccine. 28 NVIC Calls for Full Public Disclosure Watching the CDC's repeated calls for mass vaccination thatprompted fearful Americans to line up in the rain and snowto get flu shots they thought would protect them, NVICdecided to set the record straight after MedImmune sent outthe December 5 press release implying that their live nasalvaccine was more effective against the current flu (both thekilled and live vaccines contain the exact same flu strains).On December 10, 2003, NVIC issued a press release callingon federal health officials and flu vaccine makers to be honestwith the American people. NVIC also posted the press releasewith links to the February and March VRBPAC meeting tran-scripts on the NVIC Web site so members of the public couldhave access to them. 29 In NVIC's press release, Fisher said, \"Public health officialsknew last spring that it was highly likely that the A/Panamastrain in the current vaccine was not going to protect againstthe mutated, more dangerous A/Fujian strain of flu. If there is The National Vaccine Information Center The Vaccine Reaction nSpring 2004 Page 3solid new evidence that the vaccine is protective against A/Fujian, then it should be released. If there is no such evi-dence, then it is not right to lead people to believe that if theyget vaccinated now, they will be protected against it.\" That evening, Fisher appeared in an ABC Evening News report about the flu vaccine's likely ineffectiveness against the mostserious kind of flu that was generating the long lines at vac-cine clinics. In the following week, national newspapers fromThe Miami Sun-Herald 30to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette31and The Sacramento Bee32reported the story. DHHS Calls for New Manufacturing Methods Within a week of NVIC's press release, DHHS SecretaryTommy Thompson held a press conference and announcedthat DHHS was requesting congressional appropriations of$50 million for 2004 and $100 million for 2005 to developnew technologies to more quickly make flu vaccines. Hespecifically suggested research would focus on using animalcell cultures instead of eggs for production. 33 In response, NVIC's Fisher told reporters that moving tooquickly to the use of animal cell cultures could be dangerous:\"Public health agencies have to make sure there is no contam-ination of the animal cell cultures with animal viruses as hasoccurred in the past with polio vaccines using monkey kidneycell cultures.\" Fisher testified in Congress, at a September 10,2003 hearing on SV40 contamination of oral polio vaccines,that past discussions in meetings of the FDA AdvisoryCommittee had included proposals to use cancer cell sub-strates to produce vaccines as well as changing regulations topermit \"allowable thresholds\" of adventitious [extraneous]agent contamination. \"There needs to be full public disclo-sure and debate about proposed use of animal tissue culturesor cancer cell substrates to make vaccines. It is not only possi-ble, but probable, that there will be contamination of the vac-cines with extraneous agents that could lead to cancer andother degenerative diseases,\" she said. 34 CDC Admits Flu Vaccine Failed At the same time, by mid-January 2004, CDC officials whowere aggressively following up on reported flu deaths in chil-dren for the first time, reported a total of 93 flu-associateddeaths among children nationwide. The CDC also reportedthat out of nearly 60,000 suspected cases of influenza world-wide that were tested for flu virus, only 28 percent were posi- tive.Of these, about 99 percent were influenza A virus. Of the 518 influenza viruses collected by US labs, about 19 percentwere similar to A/Panama and more than 80 percent weresimilar to the genetically-mutated A/Fujian. 35 A preliminary assessment of flu vaccine effectiveness, con-ducted in Colorado, found that the flu vaccine this year wasvirtually ineffective against the A/Fujian strain that had pan-icked Americans standing in long lines for their flu shots.There was little, if any, cross protection with A/Panama. Only 3 to 14 percent of those who got vaccinated were protected againstthe flu this year. 36MedImmune Gives Away FluMist By mid-January 2004, with the flu season still in full swing and stocks of killed flu vaccine nearly depleted, MedImmune andWyeth announced they had only sold about 400,000 doses ofthe more than four million doses of live virus nasal flu vaccinethey had produced. Even after agreeing to sell doses to the fed-eral government for $20 each, less than half the $46 wholesaleprice, fewer than 75,000 doses had been used. Instead ofdestroying the remaining stocks, the companies agreed to giveaway 250,000 doses to ease the flu vaccine shortages. Aspokesman for Wyeth was quoted as saying the company waskeeping \"philanthropy with public health in mind.\" 37 But there were few takers, even when it was given away free.Instead of the $120 to $140 million in sales the companieshad projected at the beginning of the flu season, they cut theirrevenue forecast to between $55 and $85 million. By the endof January, MedImmune and Wyeth were considering aban-doning the manufacture and sale of FluMist and \"getting out\"of the market. 38 Congress to Consider Bail Out of Flu Vaccine Makers On January 28, 2004, a bill was introduced by US Senators Bayh (D-IN), Landrieu (D-LA) and Emanuel (D-IL) to reim-burse flu vaccine manufacturers when they produce more vac-cine than is used by the public. Entitled the \"Flu ProtectionAct of 2004,\" the legislation requires the CDC to purchaseback from the manufacturers unused doses of flu vaccine atthe end of each season. It also requires the CDC to \"conducta public awareness campaign and education outreach effortseach year\" and stress \"the importance of receiving the influen-za vaccine\" and \"the safety, efficacy and benefit of recom-mended vaccines for the public good.\" 39 A Look to the Future Once the CDC makes a final recommendation for \"universaluse\" of flu vaccines in children, vaccine manufacturers will beprotected against lawsuits for flu vaccine-induced injuries anddeaths under the federal vaccine injury compensation pro-gram. The CDC's \"universal use\" recommendation for fluvaccine is expected to be issued by the federal health agency'sAdvisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in2004. 40Soon after that announcement, state health officials and vaccine manufacturers are expected to lobby state legisla-tures to add flu vaccine to mandatory state vaccination lawsfor children. Every vaccine that the CDC has recommendedfor universal use in children in the past 20 years has beenmandated by some or all states for school entry, including asecond dose of measles vaccine; 4 doses of haemophilusinfluenzae b (HIB) vaccine; three doses of hepatitis B vaccine;one dose of chicken pox vaccine; and 4 doses of pneumocco-cal vaccine. 41, 42 Who Will Pay? According to a 2003 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report,\"Financing Vaccines in the 21st Century,\" the US government The National Vaccine Information Center Page 4 The Vaccine Reaction nSpring 2004currently spends more than $1 billion annually to purchase childhood vaccines from vaccine manufacturers at discountedgovernment prices to give to poor and uninsured childrenunder the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) program. Thisrepresents about 55 percent of the total childhood vaccinemarket. After the CDC recommended all children should usechicken pox and pneumococcal vaccines and these vaccineswere added to the VFC program, the VFC budget doubledfrom $500 million to over $1 billion between 2000 and 2002.The cost of giving children all CDC-recommended vaccinesin private pediatrician's offices jumped from $200 per child in1997 to about $600 in 2001. 43 In their report, the IOM suggested that the \"societal value\" ofa particular vaccine should be systematically measured andfactored into national vaccine funding and insurance reim-bursement policies. Maintaining that vaccines are not just forchildren anymore but \"provide important protection across The National Vaccine Information Center The Vaccine Reaction nSpring 2004 Page 5the lifespan, from infancy to old age,\" the report says that \"herd immunity\" from mass vaccine use protects society andreduces medical costs associated with diseases; enhances thelength and quality of life; and improves the productivity andsocial contributions of families who would otherwise be bur-dened by disease. The IOM report being circulated on Capitol Hill recom- mends a combined mandate, subsidy and voucher plan thatwould mandate insurance benefit coverage for all CDC rec- ommended vaccines in private and public health insuranceplans; a universal government subsidy for reimbursement of private and public insurers and physician providers of CDCrecommended vaccines; and a government voucher for unin- sured children and adults. Americans enrolled in privatehealth care insurance plans would end up paying vaccinemanufacturers and doctors twice for annual flu vaccinationsthey may or may not want - both through their increasinghealth insurance premiums and federal taxes. Getting the flu has been a hit or miss proposition since influenza viruses have been circulating among humans. Somepeople seem to always get the flu every year while others nevercome down with it. In the great flu epidemic of 1918, somedied and some never got sick at all. As with most viral or bac-terial infections, if you get the flu you are more vulnerable tocomplications such as otitis media and pneumonia if you arealready chronically ill or immune-compromised. But mosthealthy children and adults around the world who get the fludo not suffer complications and are left with natural immuni-ty to the particular strain of flu they got. That may be themain reason why less than a quarter of the US population typ-ically makes a special effort to get a flu shot every year. However, getting the flu is becoming politically incorrect as the CDC is moving toward a cradle to the grave approachwith flu vaccination. In the past few years federal officials (tothe enthusiastic applause of vaccine manufacturers and doc-tors profiting from selling or giving flu vaccines) have begunwidening the age limits at both ends of the age spectrum forannual flu vaccination. The CDC started at the elderly end of the spectrum. T raditionally, those over 65 have been flu vaccine targetsbecause many of the elderly are chronically ill or have impairedimmunity. But the CDC lowered that age threshold to 50 sev-eral years ago. Now all healthy (and unhealthy) adults over 50are candidates for annual flu shots according to the CDC. Not satisfied with lowering the age for adults, in the past two years the CDC has started to soften up the public to accept theidea that all healthy children between the ages of 6 months and23 months must get two flu vaccinations the first time they arevaccinated and an annual one after that. It means that futuregenerations of Americans will have little or no immunologicalexperience with type A or type B flu viruses that circulate everyyear and provide a natural, qualitatively superior and longer last-ing immunity. So future generations of Americans will become flu vaccine dependent, presumably for the rest of their lives. Itwill be a national experiment that could have a far higher finan-cial and long term health price tag than is currently appreciated. When NVIC co-founder Kathi Williams and I began encour- aging parents to become educated about diseases and vaccinesnearly 22 years ago, the CDC was recommending that ourchildren get 23 doses of 7 vaccines. 47Today the CDC is telling us that our children need to get 37 doses of 11 vaccinesand every state mandates most of them. 41The addition of 2 doses of flu vaccine for infants will bring that total to 39 dosesof 12 vaccines. And this, in the absence of long-term, case-controlled, methodologically-sound clinical studies and basicscientific research to evaluate the potential long term adverseeffects on the developing brain and immune system of repeat-ed vaccination in early childhood, as well as the possible life-long adverse effects of removing all natural immunity to dis-eases, such as influenza, in early childhood. Before CDC officials add annual flu vaccinations to the rec- ommended list of childhood vaccines, they should be requiredto explain to the public why so many already highly vaccinat-ed American children are stuck on sick and suffering fromchronic brain and immune system problems that costAmericans billions of dollars in health care and educationevery year. There aren't enough special education classrooms inthe US to handle the learning disabled, hyperactive, autistic,asthmatic, epileptic, diabetic children, whose numbers havedoubled in the past 20 years at precisely the same time thenumbers of doses of required childhood vaccines has nearlydoubled. Coincidence? Maybe. Or maybe not. Those officialsin charge of the public health better look to themselves and getbusy finding out why we have such a child health crisis in thiscountry when nearly 95 percent of our children receive morevaccines than any other child population in the world.COMMENTARYThe National Vaccine Information Center Page 6 The Vaccine Reaction nSpring 2004 Flu vaccine, like all vaccines, only provides temporary immunity (if at all) and that immunity is qualitativelydifferent from disease-induced immunity which pro-vides longer lasting protection. 44 Flu vaccine contains three specific influenza viruses and does not protect against throat, respiratory, gastrointesti-nal and ear infections caused by bacteria and other kindsof viruses that cause flu-like symptoms. Only about 20percent of all flu-like illnesses are actually influenza. 1 When the match between the vaccine and circulating viruses is close, the inactivated flu vaccine is thought tobe 70 to 90 percent effective in giving temporaryimmunity to selected strains in healthy persons under65 years old. For those over 65 years old, the efficacyrate drops to 30 to 40 percent, although it is consideredto be 50 to 60 percent effective in preventing hospital-ization or pneumonia and 80 percent effective in pre-venting death from flu caused by covered strains. 5, 45 A good indication of how the CDC disregards the precaution- ary principle when it comes to vaccine risks is its recommenda-tion that all pregnant women get flu vaccine. Most flu vaccinesgiven to adults contain mercury and CDC officials know quitewell that scientific studies have demonstrated the brain damag-ing effects of mercury on the developing fetus. As far as flu vac-cine safety goes, even the conservative Institute of Medicine(IOM) this year concluded that, before the CDC recommendsannual flu vaccinations for young children, it should increase itsmonitoring, detection and evaluation of flu vaccine associatedneurological complications. Despite recommendations since1999 by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), FDAand IOM that mercury preservatives should be taken out of allvaccines, the CDC purchased flu vaccines containing mercurythat were given to poor children under the Vaccines forChildren program during the 2003-2004 flu season. The flu vaccine fiasco this year demonstrated it is highly ques- tionable as to whether the flu vaccine is going to offer even min-imal protection against the flu you might or might not catch.And, since only 20 percent of all flu-like illness is really the flu,the odds are that the flu you think you have is not really the flu. But one thing is clear: whether you line up to get a flu shot or not should be a matter of voluntary choice. Some families optfor boosting the natural functioning of their immune systemsto resist influenza through breast feeding their infants and useof vitamin supplements, diet, exercise, chiropractic, homeop-athy or other preventive health care options. Others wouldrather get the flu and attain a qualitatively superior and longerlasting immunity than the temporary immunity a vaccinationoffers. Some parents have concluded that their children aregenetically vulnerable to vaccine complications and cannot ingood conscience put their children's lives on the line for a fluvaccine that could leave their children crippled or dead. Every American should have the right to freely choose the kindof preventive health care they want for themselves and their chil- dren. No American should be forced to get a flu shot every year. And yet, the stage is being carefully set for mass, mandatory vaccination of every American from the cradle to the grave. Ifprivate insurers are required to reimburse the insured for annu-al flu vaccinations; if federal taxes finance annual flu vaccina-tions for public health clinics; if Congress passes legislationthat has the federal government reimbursing flu vaccine man-ufacturers every year for unused doses; if the CDC is requiredto launch an even more intensive annual nationwide flu vacci-nation campaign to make sure every child and adult gets a flushot, then the next step is obvious: laws will be passed requir-ing Americans to buy and use flu vaccine. That will give thevaccine manufacturers a stable, predictable market. The gov-ernment won't have to spend the money to bail out the vaccinemanufacturers every year because the majority of Americans,who have voted with their feet and just said no to flu shots forthe past 30 years, will no longer be able to say no. If the flu vaccine is mandated to be used annually by every American, it will become the most profitable vaccine in thehistory of vaccination. Think about it: Mandated annual fluvaccination of 280 million Americans. Mandated insurancereimbursement for all flu vaccinations. Guaranteed market forflu vaccine manufacturers with no liability for vaccine injuriesand deaths. At the end of the day, a stockholder's dream anda consumer's worst nightmare. NVIC will monitor and report the unfolding story of the move by government, industry and organized medicine to makeannual flu vaccinations mandatory for all Americans from thecradle to the grave. It is a story that may well be the ultimateexample of exactly why America's hyperactive, oppressive massvaccination program is losing the public trust. Our mission continues: No forced vaccination. Not in America. The most common reactions to inactivated flu vaccine are fever, fatigue, painful joints, and headache. Themost frequently reported serious reaction, which usual-ly occurs within two weeks of vaccination, is Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, an immune mediated nerve disordercharacterized by muscle weakness, numbness, pain andparalysis that can lead to death. According to vaccine manufacturers, contraindications for the inactivated flu vaccine are fever, an impairedimmune system, egg or mercury allergy, history ofGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. 5, 45 The CDC recommends inactivated flu vaccine for women more than 14 weeks pregnant even though mostinactivated flu vaccines contain the mercury preserva-tive, thimerosal. 5, 45 Mercury has been associated with brain damage and developmental delays in newbornswhose mothers were exposed to high levels of mercuryduring pregnancy. 46FLU VACCINE FACTSThe National Vaccine Information Center The Vaccine Reaction nSpring 2004 Page 71.

She is author of The Consumer's Guide to Childhood Vaccines (NVIC, 1997) and editor of THE VACCINE REACTION and The Vaccine Hotline newsletters . During the 1980s, she helped lead a national grassroots effort to bring the issue of vaccine safety to public attention, includ-ing leading demonstrations at the Centers for DiseaseControl in Atlanta and at the White House in 1986. Laterthat year, Congress passed the National Childhood VaccineInjury Act. She served on the National Vaccine Advisory Committee for four years, where she was chair of the subcommittee onadverse events. She was appointed to the Vaccine SafetyForum at the Institute of Medicine in 1995, where she helpedto coordinate five public workshops on vaccine safety. Sheserved as the consumer voting member of the FDA Vaccinesand Related Biological Products Advisory Committee from1999 to 2003. She is a frequent public speaker at education-al health conferences, where she defends the right toinformed consent to medical interventions which can causeinjury or death, including vaccination. The mother of three children, in 1980 her two-and-a-half year old son reacted within four hours of his fourth DPT andpolio vaccinations with a convulsion, collapse shock and stateof unconsciousness. He was left with minimal brain dysfunc-tion, including multiple learning disabilities and attentiondeficit disorder. About the National Vaccine Information Center The National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC), founded in 1982 by parents of vaccine-injured chil-dren, is a 501(c)(3) non-profit, educational organiza-tion dedicated to preventing vaccine injuries anddeaths through public education. NVIC promotes sci-entific research into the biological mechanisms of vac-cine injury and death in order to identify biomarkerswhich place individuals at high risk for suffering vac-cine reactions. NVIC advocates the institution ofinformed consent protections in mass vaccination lawsand serves as a watchdog on vaccine research, develop-ment, regulation and promotion activities of publichealth agencies. After launching the vaccine safety and informed con- sent movement in the US in the early 1980s, NVIC'sco-founders worked with Congress to create theNational Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986. Thishistoric law set up a vaccine injury compensation pro-gram and included vaccine safety provisions, such asmandatory recording and reporting of hospitaliza-tions, injuries and deaths following vaccination. In 1989, NVIC sponsored an International Scientific Workshop on Pertussis and Pertussis Vaccines and, in1996, one of NVIC's major goals was realized when apurified pertussis vaccine was licensed for Americanbabies after a decade and a half of advocacy work.NVIC held the First International Public Conferenceon Vaccination in 1997 and sponsored the Second andThird International Public Conferences on vaccina-tion in 2000 and 2002 in Washington, DC. THE VACCINE REACTION is a publication of the National Vaccine Information Center ( NVIC ), a national, nonprofit organization dedicated to prevent-ing vaccine injuries and deaths through public educa-tion.
