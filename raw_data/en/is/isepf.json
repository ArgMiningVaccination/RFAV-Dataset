Our international consortium systemati-cally evaluated antibodies against Ebola virus(EBOV) using multidisciplinary assays. For eachantibody, we evaluated (GP) secreted glyco- (sGP), left un-neutralized, glycanstructures, phagocytic and natural killer cell func-tions elicited, and in vivo protection in a mouse chal- lenge model. of moststrongly epitopes maintained on endoso-mally cleaved GP, whereas maximal IEF mapped to epitopes farthest from the viral membrane. Unex-pectedly, sGP cross-reactivity did not signicantly influence in vivo protection. This comprehensive da- taset provides a rubric to evaluate novel antibodiesand vaccine responses and a roadmap for therapeu-tic development for EBOV and related viruses. INTRODUCTION Unexpected viral disease outbreaks, such as Ebola virus dis- ease, underscore the need for effective vaccines and therapies. Antibodies are a primary correlate of protection of mostapproved vaccines and can serve as pre- or post-exposure treatment strategies. Although antibody-mediated neutralization of virus in cell culture is commonly used to predict in vivo antiviral protection, non-neutralizing, but cell-targeting antibodies also confer in vivo protection ( Henry Dunand et al., 2016; Lewis1Department of Immunology and Microbiology 2Integrative Structural and Computational Biology The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA 3Ragon Institute, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA 4Department of Microbiology and Immunology 5Biochemistry Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10461, USA 6Division of Pathobiological Sciences, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706, USA 7Division of Virology, United States Army Research Institute for Infectious Diseases, Ft.

Understanding which antibody features correlate with protection in vivo could accelerate discovery and provision of protective therapeutics. The surface glycoprotein (GP) of Ebola virus (EBOV) is the key component of vaccines and target of neutralizing antibodies. In producer cells, furin cleaves GP to yield GP1 and GP2 ( Sanchez et al., 1998 ), which form a trimer of GP1-GP2 heterodimers on the viral surface ( Lee et al., 2008 ). GP1 bears the receptor-bind- ing site, glycan cap, and mucin-like domain. GP2 bears N-ter-minal peptide, internal fusion loop, stalk, and transmembranedomain ( Lee et al., 2008 ). After of virions into target cells, host cathepsins Chandran et al., 2005; Schornberg et al., 2006 ) remove the glycan cap and mucin-like domain to expose the receptor-binding site at the GP1 apex ( Miller et al., 2012 ) and form GP CL, the endosomal cleaved form of GP that allows receptor binding ( Chandran et al., 2005; Dube et al., 2009 ). After receptor binding, GP2 rearranges to form a six-helix bundle that promotes membrane fusion. During Ebola virus infection the primary product of the GP gene is secreted GP (sGP), a soluble dimer that lacks GP2 andthe mucin-like domain but shares 295 amino acids of GP1 ( San- chez et al., 1996 ). Previous studies described monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target various sites on GP and sGP, including the ''base,'' comprising both GP1 and GP2, the fusion 2008; Marzi et al., 2012; Shedlock et al., 2010; Wilson et al., 2000 ). Antibodies recognizing the GP1 head and glycan cap also bind sGP. The mechanistic basis for differences in neutralization and in vivo protection among mAbs is unclear. For example, the GP-specic antibodies KZ52, 2G4, and 4G7 all recognize over-lapping epitopes the GP base ( Lee et al., 2008; Murin et al., 2014 ), neutralize in vitro , and are escaped by the Q508R point mutation ( Audet et al., 2014; Qiu et al., 2012 monotherapy failed to protect non-human primates (NHPs) ( Oswald et al., 2007 ), but a cocktail of 2G4 and 4G7 and cocktail MB-003 has only non- and weakly neutralizing antibodies that target glycan cap or mucinepitopes, but it provided protection to NHPs ( Olinger et al., 2012 ). Further, mAb 114, recognizing both GP and sGP, pro- tected NHPs as a monotherapy ( Corti et al., 2016 ). What features beyond epitope recognition and neutralization associate with protection remain unclear, as is whether single mAbs or cocktails provide optimal therapeutic benet and theextent to which cross-reactive protection is possible. Further, neutralization capacity differs among assays. Better under- standing of features that confer protection, what assays bestpredict survival, and what combinations of antibody featuresprovide optimal protection could streamline selection of effective treatments. In 2013 the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Immunotherapeutic Consortium (VIC) began gathering antibodies to EBOV and other viruses and analyzing them under identical assay conditions to understand, from a more statistically well-powered pool, whichantibodies are best and why ( Saphire et al., 2017 ). A parallel goal was to evaluate the assays themselves to determine which in vitro tests and measurable antibody features best predict in vivo efcacy. The 171 mAbs munization, EBOV, 2007 Bundibugyo (BDBV), and 2013-2016EBOV outbreaks. Also included et al., 2014 ), KZ52 ( Maruyama 2015; Keck et al., 2015; Koellhoffer et al., 2012; Pascal et al., 2018; Qiu et al., 2012; Takada et al., 2003; Wilson et al., 2000 ). The study results describe relation- ships between epitopes recognized on EBOV GP and antibody functions and inform strategies for recognition and development of effective antibody-based therapeutics to treat infection. RESULTS Antibody Standardization and Characterization We analyzed 171 mAbs donated by 16 investigators for isotype, species, and EBOV GP reactivity. A total of 168 mAbs were analyzed after elimination of 3 mAbs that had low sample qualityor GP purication tag reactivity. The sample pool included 102 human mAbs (94 IgG1, 1 IgG3, 21Research Center for USA 24Singapore Immunology Network, Agency for Science, Technology and (A*STAR), 939Figure 1.

A total of 79 mAbs had sGP cross-reactivity, of which 39 bind the glycan cap and 40 the GP1 core. The other 89 had epitopes distributed across the mucin-like domain, the ''base'' and GP CL core regions. ELISA reactivity was insufcient to map epitopes for 30 mAbs, but 8 (1 base, 2 glycan cap, 2 HR2, and 3 fusion loop binding mAbs) were resolved using single particle electronmicroscopy and alanine scanning ( Figures 1 ,S1, and unknown bindingsites ( Figures 1 E and 1F). Three Independent Assays for Evaluation of mAb Neutralization Disparities in previous antibody-mediated neutralization results could be due to differing experimental conditions and model sys-tems ( Davidson et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016; Wilkinson et al., 2017; Wilson et al., 2000 ). Thus, we characterized the neutralization of each mAb in three assays: (1) replication-competent EBOV ( Figure 2 ) performed under BSL-2+, BSL-3, and BSL-4 containment, respectively, as previously described, to ensureconsistency with previous studies. Of the 168 mAbs, 96 regis- tered as consistent non-neutralizers (no neutralization e.g., VIC 1, Figure 2 A), 45 as consistent neutralizers (neutralize in every assay to some degree, e.g., VIC 8), and 27 as inconsistent neutralizers (neutralize in only some assays, e.g., VIC 12). Of the 27 inconsistent neutralizers, 12 varied by a smaller degree (mod-erate to non-neutralizing, e.g., VIC 104 in HR2), while 15 varied by a larger degree (potent to non- neutralizing, e.g., VIC 5 in glycan cap). Inconsistent neutralizers varied among the experi-mental systems in both degree of neutralization and which modelsystem was neutralized. Thus, mAb selection using a single neutralization assay is a functional but imperfect funnel. Several trends emerged. The authentic EBOV assay was more forgiving: 15 and rVSV, but not DVP30 (Figure 2 A). Interestingly, these 11 left a larger (2%-40%; median 20%) un-neutralized viral fraction in rVSV ( Figure 2 A), which could indicate low binding afnity or an epitope heterogeneous in conformation or glycosylation state. This heterogeneity inantigenic presentation may underlie previously observed differ- ences among neutralization assay results for the same mAb and could be an important component in selecting therapeu- tic mAbs. Neutralization by glycan cap mAbs in particular differed be- tween authentic EBOV and the two model systems. Among mAbs that only neutralize authentic EBOV, 9/15 recognize theglycan cap ( Figure 2 A). Further, for authentic EBOV, the mean neutralization value for glycan cap mAbs was signicantly higher than that of mucin, GP1/2, and unknown epitopes ( Figures 2B-2E). An important difference among the three neutralization assays was the presence of sGP. The rVSV system is engineered to prevent sGP expression, but DVP30 authentic EBOV assays levels ( As such, we expected sGP-reactive mAbs (e.g., glycan cap) to exhibit stronger neutralization in the rVSV assay. Paradoxically, only2/43 glycan cap antibodies (VIC 5 and 81) had stronger neutral-ization in rVSV, whereas 11/43 had weaker rVSV neutralization than in sGP-containing assays. Relationship of Epitope to Neutralization For mAbs against GP1, neutralization potency varied by the GP1 region recognized. Only mucin mAbs neutralized in anyassay. In contrast, 5/6 mAbs near the re- Glycan were had neutralizing activity in at least two assays. Overall,mAbs recognizing the GP1 head, fusion loop, base, and HR2 pre-sent in GP CLwere more likely to neutralize than mAbs targeting GP regions removed by enzymatic cleavage ( Figure epitope 12/15 mAbs in the GP1/2 class (bind GP CL, but could not be assigned as base, fusion, or stalk), did not neutralize at all. In natural infection, abundant sGP could limit effective neutral- ization of circulating virus by sGP-cross-reactive antibodies (Ilinykh et al., 2016; Mohan et al., 2012 )(Figure 2 ). However, as mentioned above, we typically saw equivalent or weaker relative neutralization in rVSV relative to the sGP-containing DVP30 sGP-cross reactive glycan cap groupconstitutes the majority of the discordant antibodies that did notneutralize rVSV at all, but did neutralize in the sGP-containing authentic EBOV assay. Thus, the presence of sGP does not itself appear to be detrimental to neutralization of sGP-reactive mAbs. Relationship of Epitope to Protection We next assessed whether each of the 168 mAbs could conferprotection to BALB/c mice variant) ( Bray et al., 1998 ). Groups of 10 mice each received one 100 mg mAb dose two (E) VIC mAb epitope classes. The total number of mAbs in class is shown; mAbs.

Protection levels of 60%- 100%, 40%-50%, and <40% were seen for 49, respectively ( Figure 3 mAbs con- ferredR60% protection ( Figures 3 Aa n d S3). Of GP2-containing epitopes, 6/8 fusion loop, 10/14 base, with unknownepitopes were protective ( Figures 3 Aa n d S3). Although mAbs against the GP1/Head, base, fusion loop, and HR2 had signi- cantly higher mean protection values ( Figure 3 B), every epitope class contained at least one mAb that conferred high ( R80%) protection. Relationship of Neutralization to Protection Although non-neutralizing antibodies can offer in vivo protection from Ebola and other viruses ( Haynes et al., 2012; Henry Dunandet al., 2016; Horwitz et al., 2017; Lewis et al., 2015; Olinger et al., 2012; Wilson et al., 2000 ), neutralization is often the primary selector of mAbs for in vivo evaluation. Here we aimed to cast a broad net across this mAb panel to measure correlation be- tween in vitro neutralization and protection in the mouse model. In each assay, neutralization potency showed a high and statistically signicant correlation with protection. This relation- ship was the strongest for fraction of rVSV left unneutralized(Spearman's =/C00.068) and rVSV IC 50(= 0.67), followed by the percentage of infected cells in the authentic EBOV assay (= 0.65) and unsupervised K-means clustering analysis, we clustered the mAbs by neutralization results, then independently co- plotted protection values ( Figure 4 ). The ve clusters contained mAbs that: (1) were non-neutralizing, (2) failed to neutralizeDVP30, (3) only neutralize authentic EBOV, (4) neutralize model systems better than EBOV, and (5) neutralize in all assays. Although there were general trends (88% of consistently non-neutralizing antibodies do not protect, while 89% of the consis- tently neutralizing antibodies do), each cluster had a range of Figure 2. Comparison of Neutralization Assay Results (A) Results are color-coded according to the ranges listed. mAbs are grouped by epitope class and arranged by position on the GP structure.

For cluster 1, 9% of non-neutralizing mAbs were moderately protective and another 3.3% weremore highly protective (VIC 115, VIC 121 and VIC 143). In clus- ter 5, VIC 42, VIC 76, VIC 101, and VIC 108 neutralized robustly but protected %50%. Selecting by neutralization alone would thus identify most, but not all, protective antibodies. Further, comparison of cluster 5 to 2-4 suggests that protection is best identied by the ability to neutralize in several distinctsystems. Binding to Other Filovirus GPs and Mouse Adapted- Ebola Virus Neutralization assays were performed using virions bearing wild-type EBOV GP, whereas protection studies used ma-EBOV three GP point mutations (S65P, signicantly differ between wild-type and GP by ELISA, including those mAbs that neutralized wild-type GP in culture but did notprotect in vivo (Figure S4 ). Thus, use of ma-EBOV does not explain the failure of these neutralizing mAbs to confer protection. ELISA assessment of VIC panel mAb binding to the GP ectodo- main of West African (i.e., Makona) and Central African (i.e., Figure 3. Relationship between in vivo Protection and Epitope Class for VIC mAbPanel (A) Groups of 10 mice were infected with ma- EBOV and treated with 100 mg/ml of the indicated mAb on day 2 post-infection. The nal percentageof surviving animals is indicated.(B) Parametric analysis of correlation betweenepitope class and protection. Black and white barsindicate mean values. The mean values for HR2,fusion, base, and GP1/Head differed signicantlyfrom those in the panel (91%) bound Mayinga and MakonaGP equally well ( Figure 5 ). Nine, distributed across six epitope groups, had reduced binding to Makona GP. Makona-relatedsubstitutions thus affected a minority of mAbs, but at a variety of epitopes. A total of 75/168 mAbs recognized at least one other lovirus GP, and 27 hadpan-ebolavirus reactivity. Fusion loop mAbs were most frequently fully cross- by GP1/Core were cross-reactive. Of the cross-reactive antibodies, 24 neutralizedin least two of the three EBOV neu- tralization assays performed and 25 conferred R60% protection. VIC 78, 98, 109, and 111 cross-reacted with marburgvirus Ravn GP on ELISA ( Figure 5 ), but no EBOV/RAVV cross-reactive mAb had strong protection or neutralization activity. Immune Effector Function of VIC Panel mAbs Association of Fc-Mediated Effector Functionality with mAb-Mediated ProtectionThe nding that several mAbs afforded in vivo protection but showed little in vitro neutralization activity suggests that protec- tion involves other factors. Thus, we measured the ability ofmAbs to engage the innate immune system via induction of seven different immune effector functions (IEFs). Phagocytosis removes pathogen-infected cells and can be mediated by monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, andneutrophils. To account for differences subclasses and FcR engagement ( Bruhns, 2012 phagocy-tosis dependent phagocytosis (ADNP) by human neutrophils, with phagocytic scores for each mAb calcu-lated as described in the Methods. Most VIC mAbs (< 75%) induced ADCP, yet only 30% induced ADNP ( Figure 6 ). In all four assays, Tier 1, the outermost region of Cell 174, 938-952, August 9, 2018 943the GP molecule with respect to the virus membrane that encompasses the mucin, glycan cap, and GP1/Head groups,had the highest phagocytic activity relative to Tiers 2 (base, fusion, and GP1/Core) and 3 (GP1/2 and HR2). Furthermore, the glycan cap epitope class induced signicantly more phago-cytic activity compared to other epitope classes ( Figure 6 , S5A-S5D). Natural killer (NK) cells play a key role in antiviral immunity by directly killing infected cells or secreting chemokines and cyto-kines to activate immune signaling pathways ( Waggoner et al., ). NK et al., 1998 ). Among the 168 mAbs, 33 induced moderate to strong levels of all three NK markers ( Figure 6 ). Ten, across seven epitope groups, strongly activated all three NK functions and 6/10 pro-tected to R60%. Of these, four were also strong neutralizers, whereas VIC 100 (HR2) did not neutralize VP D30 and VIC 143 (mucin) had no neutralization activity. A second group of 10mAbs elicited high levels of IFN gand MIP-1 b, but not CD107a. Of these, ve protected to R60% and three had strong neutral- ization activity, whereas VIC 137 and 141 neutralized only authentic EBOV. Base and GP1/Head mAbs had higher average NK scores other epitope classes ( Figure 6 ). Fc Polyfunctionality of VIC Panel mAbsPolyfunctionality (PF) describes the ability of an antibody to re- cruit multiple IEFs and is associated with increased vaccination efcacy ( Ackerman et al., 2016; Chung et al., 2014 ). Here, PF was scored from 0-7, with one point for each phagocytic orNK function having activity above a dened threshold relative to a control mAb ( Figure 6 ). Among the panel, 29 (mostly human) mAbs induced 6 or 7 effector functions, while 33 IgG1, or 1 IEF. PF was signicantly positively correlated with protection (p = 8.03 310 /C06). Among the 48 mAbs that conferred R60% protection, the average PF score was 4.0, compared to 2.7 for mAbs with lower protection activity. Among non-protectivemAbs, 11 induced no IEFs, whereas all protective group mAbs induced at least one IEF ( Figure 6 ). The mucin epitope group had the highest average PF score of 3.95 and all elicited at least 2 IEFs, with 80% eliciting R4. GP1/Head and glycan cap mAbs average scores of 3.7 and 3.5, respectively ( Figure S5 E). Glycosylation and mAb function Capillary electrophoresis analysis showed that VIC mAbs had notable heterogeneity in the relative abundance of specicglycans Table S3 ). G0F, G2S1FB, and total G0 glycosylation levels were positively associated with protection, whereas Figure 4. K-Means Clustering of VIC mAb Neutralization Readouts Clusters C1-C5 are based on neutralization activity (normalized with 1.0 as the maximum value). In vivo protection results are shown for reference. VIC 115, 121, and 143 (arrows) protect but do not neutralize. 944 Cell 174, 938-952, August 9, 2018G2S1 and G1S1F had a negative association ( Figures 7 A and 7B). Mucin-specic mAbs had higher levels of G1F' and total G1 glycans, consistent with the reduced protective efcacy seen for this class ( Figures S6 C and S6E). GP1/Head mAbs were more likely to have G0F and had the lowest amounts of total G1 (Figures S6 A and S6E), consistent with the elevated protec- tive of this group ( Figure 3 ). Fc functions and gly- cans are analyzed in greater detail in a companion publication(Gunn et al., 2018 ). Regression Analysis of VIC Antibody Function Correlation Network We used pairwise Spearman's correlation coefcients to identify pairwise relationship(s) between http://apps. vhmmunotherapy.org/corrnetwork ;http://apps.vhmmunotherapy. org/vic-data-explorer/ ) allows visualization of relationships be- tween protection and single mAb features, as well as identica- tion of the multiple mAb features that together could contribute to a given functional response or protection. As expected,protection had a strong positive correlation with all four neutral-ization readouts ( = 0.61-0.68) and a moderate positive correla- tion with polyfunctionality ( = 0.35). Neutralization activity was positively associated with base, fusion, and HR2 mAbs (Tiers 2 and 3) and negatively associated with mAbs targeting the mucin domain. In contrast, phagocy- tosis, and thus total PF, were positively associated with Tier 1epitopes ( = 0.31). NK functions, however, linked neither to tier nor epitope. Both neutralization and PF were improved bystronger binding to GP: lower EC 50values correlated with greater neutralization and higher PF. Neutralization activity had a weak positive and negative, respectively, correlation with Total G0 ( = 0.21-0.28) and G2F (=/C00.2--0.26), whereas Total ( = 0.26), Of the NK activity negatively with G2S1F, butboosted by afucosylated G2S1B, consistent with afucosylation of Fc gRIIIa-mediated NK cell activation ( Shields et al., 2002 ). Features Predictive of Antibody Protection We built and evaluated multivariate models of protection using four machine learning algorithms. Logistic regression with elasticnet regularization (LR) ( Zou and = 0.959, Figure S7 A) and generated a multivariate model of protection employing 17 mAb features ( Figure 7 B). Random forest (RF) regression with 10-fold cross-validation showedthat this approach predicted protection conferred by the VIC panel mAbs with reasonable accuracy (mean absolute error = 16.1%; Figure S7 B). Ranking the importance of features for RF predictions supports a dominant role for the three neutralization assays followed by mAb PF ( Table S4 ). Other variables were incorporated in the RF regressionpredictions, but their contribution was not substantial (feature importance < 0.02). Figure 5. ELISA Cross-Reactivity of VIC mAbs with GP of Other Ebolavirus Species ELISA cross-reactivity of VIC mAbs with GP of other Ebolavirus species (Bundibugyo virus, BDBV; Ravn virus (RAVV). Strong, moderate, and weak/no neutralization were scored as 2, 1, and 0, respectively, in the four assays. Cell 174, 938-952, August 9, 2018 945Although unneutralized fraction of rVSV had the strongest cor- relation with in vivo survival in RF analyses, it is, by itself, not always an accurate predictor of protection. Whereas most mAbs that protected to R60% also showed a minimal unneu- tralized fraction ( Figure 7 C, upper right quadrant), others do not. VIC 143, VIC 145, and VIC 151 each had high protection levels despite leaving 100% (VIC 143, VIC 145) or 85% (VIC151) of rVSV un-neutralized. Meanwhile, PF appears to be largely independent of neutralization activity ( Figure 7 D). Together, these statistical analyses show how multiple mAb featurescontribute to protection and can guide design of protectivemAb cocktails. DISCUSSIONThe VIC study analyzed mAbs donated from laboratories around the world and identied from a variety of sources to gain greaterinsight into which antibody features confer protection and which assays best identify these features. This study also represents amajor effort to determine the level of agreement among neutral- ization assays and whether surrogate systems can substitute for authentic virus in these assays. Considering the entire VIC panel, human EBOV mAbs were signicantly more likely to protect than murine mAbs (43 hu- man/49 highly protective). However, human mAbs in this study were typically chosen from larger panels in studies performedduring or after the 2013-2016 epidemic. Therefore, we cannot rule out that the apparent improvement in protection simply reflects a greater selection stringency for these mAbs. A unique feature of the VIC study was the casting of a broad and agnostic experimental net: each mAb was evaluated in each of 30 assays. Network correlation and machine learning approaches showed that among the features assessed, neutral-ization had the strongest correlation with protection ( = 0.61- 0.68). Interestingly, however, among the 49 highly protective antibodies, only 20 had strong activity in all three neutralizationassays while 29 did not, indicating that no single neutralization assay alone can always predict protection. K-means clustering Figure 6. Immune Effector Functions and VIC mAb Polyfunctionality Induction of phagocytosis exposure) measured for each mAb. Polyfunctionality scores ranged from 0-7, with one point given for strong or moderate activity on each of seven readouts. Tier 1 epitopes lie the farthest from the membrane. 946 Cell 174, 938-952, August 9, 2018indicated that the DVP30 and rVSV assays tended to give a binary readout (i.e., yes/no), whereas authentic EBOV readouts captured a broader range of neutralization behavior ( Figures 2 and 4). Further, each cluster contains mAbs from a variety of epitope classes, suggesting that epitope is not the sole determi- nant of neutralization behavior. However, three trends emerged:Base and fusion loop mAbs were predominantly in cluster 5 (consistent neutralization in all systems); Most GP1/Core mAbs were cluster 1 (no neutralization in any system); and Glycan cap/sGP epitope mAbs were in all ve clusters, but 11/21 werein Cluster 3 (antibodies that neutralized only in EBOV). We note several differences among the assays that could affect Figure 7.

Cell 174, 938-952, August 9, 2018 947neutralization readout including: (1) a shorter, bullet-shaped rhabdovirus particle in rVSV versus a longer, lovirion-shaped particle in DVP30 and authentic EBOV; (2) presence of wild- type sGP levels in DVP30 and EBOV assays versus no sGP in rVSV; and (3) detection of infected cells via reporter gene expres- sion in rVSV and DVP30 versus KZ52-mediated detection of fected cells in authentic EBOV. Overall, the DVP30 assay was more stringent, focusing on the most potent neutralization hits,whereas the authentic EBOV assay was more forgiving, detect- ing a range of intermediate neutralization behavior and unique neutralizers ( Figures 2 A and 2E). Although the neutralization as- says differed according to dened thresholds, absolute differ- ences among the assays were clear (100% neutralization versus 0% neutralization) even at the highest antibody concentration(e.g., VIC 12, VIC 20, VIC 67), which cannot be explained by the chosen threshold alone. Our results indicated that sGP cross-reactivity did not impede neutralization in assays where sGP was present. In some cases,neutralization activity was higher in the presence of sGP. Others found parallel results. For example, the sGP-reactive mAb BDBV289 neutralizes better than How- ever, in another study, sGP competed for anti-GP antibodies, but only in mice immunized with sGP ( Mohan et al., 2012 epitopes typi-cally did not neutralize well. The inability to achieve a stableEM reconstruction or to obtain clear results by alanine scanning may be related to poor binding, which could also negatively affect neutralization. IEFs also link to a spatial pattern on GP related to the distance from the viral membrane ( Figure 6 ). Tier 1 mAbs consistently re- cruited higher phagocytic activity and in turn achieve greaterlevels of PF than Tiers 2 and 3 mAbs ( = 0.31 for Tier 1 versus <0.1, Tiers 2 and 3). An upper and outer antibody binding posi- tion on GP could assist Fc recognition by FcR-bearing cells ( Lux et al., 2013 ). Influenza behaves differently: stalk rather than head antibodies were noted to more successfully recruit Fc-mediated functions ( Krammer and Palese, 2015 ). The GP1/Head class had both high neutralization and IEF activity. Nearly all (5/6) GP1/Head antibodies were highly protec- tive. mAb 114, a head-binding antibody not included in the panel, protects NHPs as a monotherapy ( Corti et al., 2016 ). GP1/Head mAbs are consistently effective, but every epitope class included at least one highly protective mAb in mice. Although neutralization correlated with protection, eight mAbs were protective in mice, yet failed to neutralize well. Of these, VIC 115 (GP1/Core), 121 (unknown) and 143 (mucin) lacked any neutralization activity, whereas VIC 137, 141, 145, and 152(cap) and VIC 150 (GP1/Core) registered as moderate neutral-izers only for authentic EBOV (Cluster 3). In total, ve of these eight mAbs recognized Tier 1 epitopes. All eight recruited higher levels of IEF (mean PF, phagocytosis and NK function scores of5.5/7, 3.4/4 and 2.25/3, respectively). In contrast, the nineantibodies that neutralized well, but failed to protect R60% (VIC 8, 11, 15, 16, 39, 42, 76, 83, and 101) had lower mean PF, phagocytosis, and NK function scores (2.5/7, 2.1/4 but non- or weakly neutralizing mAbs constituted 5% of the VIC panel. More such antibodies could exist for Ebola virus, but may not have been pursued because initialantibody downselection is typically based on neutralization. Inmany EBOV vaccine studies, total antibody binding, rather than neutralization, is the best correlate of protection ( Lenne- mann et al., 2017; Pushko al., 2000; Schmaljohn and Lewis,2016; Sullivan et al., 2009; Wong et al., 2012 ). Antibodies that recognize the IEF-linked, more accessible Tier 1 epitopes may even take precedence in polyclonal responses elicitedby vaccination. Indeed, GP1/Head and glycan cap mAbs were the most abundantly recognized epitopes by antibodies in vaccinee sera ( Khurana et al., 2016 ) rVSV-based EBOV vaccine ( Regules et al., 2017 ). The fre- quency of these antibodies persisted after the second vaccine dose, whereas that of HR2 and membrane-proximal antibodies decreased. Other recent studies illuminated the role of binding, but non- neutralizing, antibodies in mediating protection against other viruses ( Bootz et al., 2017; Henry Dunand et al., 2016; Horwitz et al., 2017; Lewis et al., 2017; Mayr et al., 2017; Perez et al., 2017; Schmaljohn, 2013 ). Such antibodies may have contributed to the benet observed in the RV144 HIV-1 vaccine trial ( Corey et al., 2015; Santra et al., 2015 ) and provide added protection to that afforded by neutralizing antibodies, or when neutralizing antibodies are difcult to elicit. One limitation of this study is the use of only Vero cells for the neutralization assays. Use of Vero cells links our results to previous studies, but numerous cell types would be infected in vivo .F o r in vivo protection assays, the large scale and study design (i.e., each mAb evaluated for in vivo protection) neces- sitated use of mice rather than NHPs. Moreover, for in vivo protection studies we evaluated only a single virus dose- thesame dose used in earlier work- to allow comparisons across studies. On the other hand, the scale was perhaps not large enough: analysis of thousands of mAbs might be requiredfor statistical signicance in all comparisons and to dissectco-occurring variables such as glycan identity, FcR-mediated functions, and isotype. Our focus on IgG class mAbs that recognize Ebola virus GP and on post-exposure protection isan additional limitation. Certainly, in natural infection, IgM and IgA contribute to protection ( Hasegawa et al., 2015 ), and antibodies against other viral antigens may contribute torecognition and killing of infected cells. Antibody stoichiom- etry, whether different antibody features or antibody classes would be required pre- rather than post-exposure, and howthe array of desired antibodies elicited by vaccination might differ from mAbs are also unknown. Overall however, this study provides an array of biochemical, biophysical, andcellular assay data from which smaller, representative groupsof mAbs could then be evaluated in larger animals (e.g., guinea pigs, ferrets, NHPs). Moving these representative groups for- ward would allow better comparison of protection, and under- standing of what features drive protection, across commonly 948 Cell 174, 938-952, August 9, 2018used animal models. This dataset now provides a basis for se- lecting focused groups for precise engineering, alteration, and testing of single variables. In summary, the major ndings are: (1) both neutralization and immune PF contribute to in vivo protection; (2) mAbs recognizing regions retained in GP CLwere more likely to neutralize, whereas mAbs targeting upper Tier 1 epitopeswere more likely to elicit phagocytosis; (3) neutralization assaysyielded variable results, and disagreed about as often as they agreed, with discordance occurring primarily for mAbs with a signicant un-neutralized fraction or those against the glycancap; (4) the fusion loop, GP1/Head, and GP1/Core epitope groups had the highest frequency of ebolavirus cross-reac- tivity; (5) sGP reactivity did not influence neutralization or pro-tection; (6) particular glycan structures could be positively or negatively correlated with protection, neutralization and IEF; and (7) network correlation and IIP calculation indicate thatmultiple factors are together predictive of mAb protection.Findings from this study can serve as a framework for future exploration, and for analysis of antibodies against other impor- tant human pathogens.

Some sets were puried according to previously described methods ( Bornholdt et al., 2016; Flyak et al., 2015, 2016 Fusco et al., 2015; Holtsberg et al., 2015; Keck et al., 2015; Qiu et al., 2011, 2014; Takada et al., 2003; Wilson et al., 2000 ). For one set of mAbs, VelocImmune/C226mice ( Macdonald et al., 2014; Murphy et al., were immunized with puried EBOV GP as immunogens. Splenocytes were then harvested and used to isolate EBOV GP-reactive B cells. cDNAs fromreactive B cells were synthesized via reverse transcriptase (RT) reaction (SuperScript III, Invitrogen) and the variable heavy and lightchains were amplied by PCR and cloned into expression vectors containing a human IgG1 heavy chain constant region and kappa light chain constant region, respectively. Recombinant anti-EBOV GP antibodies were produced in CHO cells following stable trans- fection with paired expression plasmids carrying heavy and light chains derived from the same B cell. Antibodies were puried fromculture supernatants by Protein A afnity chromatography. One set of antibodies was isolated from human volunteers primed with chimpanzee adenovirus expressing Zaire GP (ChAD3 EBO Z) and boosted with MVA-BN Filo (modied Vaccinia expressing Ebola, Sudan and Marburg virus GPs and Ta \u00a8Forest virus NP) vaccines ( Ewer et al., 2016 ). Antibodies were puried as described in Huang et al. ( Huang et al., 2015 ). Another mAb set was derived using recombinant EBOVGP Dmucin (GenBank: KM233090) or two rounds of panning with EBOVGP Dmucin followed by two rounds of panning with rEBOVGP33-308 (GenBank: AAC54887.1) or EBOVGP Dmucin followed by one round of panning with rEBOVGP33-308. Antibody isolation using phage display technology was performed accord-ing to Goh et al. ( Goh et al., 2014 ). For another set, antibody heavy and light chain variable region genes were cloned from peripheral blood B cells and plasmablasts of patients treated for Ebola virus disease at Emory University hospital (Davis and Ahmed, unpub- lished data). Antibodies were produced in HEK293 cells as human IgG1s as previously described ( Smith et al., 2009 ). Mice Female BALB/c mice, aged 6 to 8 weeks-old (Charles River Laboratory) housed in microisolator cages and given chow and water ad libitum were used for in vivo protection assays. All animal work involving infectious live virus was performed in the BSL-4 laboratories at USAMRIID or PHAC. At USAMRIID, all work with animals was conducted in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and other Federal statutes and regulations relating to animals and experiments involving animals and adhered to the principles stated in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, NRC Publication, 1996 edition. All procedures were reviewed and approvedby the appropriate Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at USAMRIID. Work performed at PHAC was approved by the Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health Animal Care Committee following the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Cell lines Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2) were used for purication of recombinant GPs. HEK293 and ExpiCHO cultured according to the man- ufacturer's instructions were used for mAb purication. HEK293T cells were used for alanine scanning mutagenesis. The DVP30 neutralization used Vero cells expressing Ebola virus VP30 that were cultured as previously described ( Halfmann et al., 2008 ). In vitro neutralization assays with authentic EBOV were performed using Vero E6 cells cultured as previously described ( Holtsberg et al., 2015 ). For rVSV assays Vero cells were used as described ( Wong et al., 2010 ). ADCP was measured using monocyte cell lines THP-1 (human) and RAW264.7 (murine) that were cultured as described ( Gunn et al., 2018 ). Primary cells Human NK cells were enriched from human peripheral blood samples using negative selection with RosetteSep (Stem Cell Technol-ogies) followed by Ficoll separation. Viruses Mouse-adapted EBOV/Mayinga (EBOV/M.mus-tc/COD/76/Yambuku-Mayinga) was used for neutralization assays involving authentic Ebola virus and for in vivo protection studies. Ebola DVP30-RenLuc virus was used for DVP30 neutralization assays and rVSV-EBOV/Mayinga GP (EBOV/H.sap-tc/COD/76/Yambuku-Mayinga was used for rVSV neutralization assays. METHOD lacking residues 637-676 of the transmembrane domain (GPe) or GP lacking both the trans- membrane and mucin domains (residues 312-462; GPe Dmuc) were previously described ( Murin et al., 2014 ). The sGP construct encoded GP truncated at residue P314. All constructs carried a C-terminal double strep tag (enterokinase cleavage site followedby a strep tag/linker/strep tag) for purication and were cloned into modied pMT-puro vectors for expression in Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2) cells ( Hashiguchi et al., 2015 . Stably transfected cells were selected with 6 mg/ml puromycin. The resulting strep-tagged proteins were puried using Strep-Tactin resin (QIAGEN) followed by further purication by SEC using a Superdex200 (S200) column with 10 mM Tris and 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5 (1 3TBS). GP CLwas produced by incubating 1 mg GPe with Cell 174, 938-952.e1-e6, August 9, 2018 e30.02 mg thermolysin overnight at room temperature in TBS with 1 mM CaCl 2followed by SEC purication on a Superdex 200 SEC column. GPe Dmuc carrying the Q508R mutation was puried as previously described ( Murin et al., 2014 ). RAVV GP (Kenya 1987 Kitum Cave variant) was produced as previously described ( Fusco et al., 2015 ) and BDBV (Uganda 2007 Butalya variant), SUDV (Uganda 2000 Gulu variant) and RESTV (USA 1989 Philippines 89 variant) ( Holtsberg et al., 2015 ) were produced similarly to EBOV. The Makona (West African) ectodomain (GenBank KM034562.1), expressed as per EBOV, has lower trimeric propensity than Mayinga (Central Africa), which could affect mAbs that target quaternary epitopes. ELISA analysis of antibody binding to GP ELISA assays were performed as previously described ( Murin et al., 2014 ). Briefly, 96-well plates were coated overnight with the indicated antigen at 0.2 mg/well, washed three times with PBS, and blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for one hour at room temperature. Antibodies were added at 2, 0.2, and 0.02 mg/ml and incubated for one hour at room temperature. For EC 50measurements, 10-fold serial dilutions of antibodies from 20 mg/ml were measured. After binding, the wells were washed and HRP-conjugated secondary antibody diluted 1:4,000 in 0.5% BSA was added and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. A TMB substrate kit (Pierce) was used for detection at 450 nm. The reactivity threshold was dened as OD450 R1.0 AU at 2 mg/ml antibody. Epitope mapping by electron microscopy of IgG Fab fragments complexed with GP DTM Antibody Fabs were prepared as described previously ( Bornholdt et al., 2016 ) and incubated with Zaire GP DTM at a ratio of 10:1 (Fab:GP) overnight at 4/C14C. Complexes were puried by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) before being deposited onto carbon-coated copper mesh grids and staining with 2% uranyl of the grids using a 120 Tecnai Spirit electron microscope and a TemCam F416 4k x 4k CCD was conducted as described ( Zhao et al., 2017 ). Processing of the imaged particles was achieved following organization into stacks and alignment by iterative MRA/MSA, wherein clean 2D particle stacks were subjected to EMAN2 renement to produce a 3D model, as previously described ( Zhao et al., 2017 ). UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 ) was used to dock crystal structures of GP DTM into the image reconstructions. Epitope mapping by alanine scanning mutagenesis Alanine scanning mutagenesis was performed on GP and on GP lacking the mucin-like domain (residues 311-461) wherein residueswere mutated to alanine (alanine residues were mutated to serine) to create clone libraries of point mutants. The clones were indi- vidually arrayed into 384-well plates and transfected into HEK293T cells and the protein was allowed to express for 22 hr ( Davidson et al., 2015 ). The indicated mAbs were incubated with the cells for 1 hr before an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) was added. Antibody binding was assessed by detection of cellular fluorescence withan Intellicyt high throughput flow cytometer measured in vector-trans- fected control cells and mAb reactivity against the mutant clones was calculated with respect to reactivity with wild-type GP DTM by subtracting the signal from mock-transfected controls and normalized to signals from wild-type transfected controls. Residues pre-dicted to be involved in the epitope were identied if no reaction was seen between the mAb and the mutant clone, but reactivity of other control mAbs was observed, which excludes GP mutants that are misfolded or had low expression levels. Neutralization of Ebola DVP30-RenLuc virus An Ebola virus in which the reporter gene Renilla luciferase is substituted for the viral transcription factor VP30 (Ebola DVP30-RenLuc virus) was used to complement a Vero cell line that stably expresses VP30 in trans (Vero VP30), thus allowing analysis at BSL-3 ( Half- mann et al., 2008 ). A total of 5 310 3focus forming units of Ebola DVP30-RenLuc virus diluted in 2% fetal calf serum in minimal essential medium were incubated with 50 mg/ml monoclonal antibody for 3 hours at 37/C14C. The virus/antibody mixture at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001 was then added to Vero VP30 cells, seeded the previous day in 96-well plates at 9 3103cells/well and incubated for three days at 37/C14C and 5% CO 2. If used, guinea pig complement (Cedarlane) was added to the minimal essential medium at a nal concentration of 10%. Then a live cell luciferase substrate, EnduRen (Promega), was incubated with the cells for three hours before luciferase values were measured as relative light units (RLU) using a Tecan M1000 plate reader (Tecan). Assays were performed in duplicate known neutralizing (GP 133/3.16) and non-neutralizing monoclonal (VP35 5/69.3.2) was used apositive and negative control, respectively. Antibodies that neutralized luciferase signals by R95% were dened as whereas inhibition of luciferase signals by 50%-94% were considered moderate neutralizers and those that had 49% or lower inhibition were categorized as weak/non-neutralizers. Neutralization of authentic EBOV Assays to assess neutralization of authentic EBOV were performed according to the method described in Holtsberg et al. ( Holtsberg et al., 2015 ). Vero E6 cells were seeded 2.5 310 /C04cells/well in the inner 60 wells of black 96-well plates 24 hours prior to virus infection. Antibodies were serially diluted in Vero growth medium (Eagle minimum essential medium with Earle's salts and L-gluta- mine, 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin) at two times the desired nal concentration (50 mg/ml), mixed with an equal volume of live EBOV, and incubated for 1 hour at 37/C14C with mixing every 15 min. The antibody/virus mixture at a MOI of 0.2 was then added to the Vero cells and incubated for 1 hr at 37/C14C, washed with PBS, and growth medium alone was added to e4 Cell 174, 938-952.e1-e6, August 9, 2018all wells and the plates were incubated for an additional 48 hr at 37/C14C. The cells were then xed with 10% neutral buffered formalin and the percentage of infected cells was determined by an indirect immunofluorescence assay using the EBOV-specic human mAb KZ52 and goat anti-human IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes) as a secondary antibody. Images were acquired at 20 elds/well with a 20x objective lens on an Operetta High Content Imaging System (Perkin-Elmer). Operetta images were analyzedwith a customized algorithm built from image analysis functions available in Harmony software (Perkin-Elmer). The percentage of inhibition for each antibody was determined relative to control cells incubated with media alone. Antibodies that reduced the percent- age of infected cells by > 80% were categorized as strong neutralizers, whereas those that reduced infection by between 50% and79% and less than 50% were considered as moderate neutralizers and weak/non-neutralizers, respectively. Neutralization of rVSV-EBOV GP Recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) expressing both eGFP and recombinant surface GP (rVSV-EBOV) in place of VSV G wasdescribed previously ( Wec et al., 2016; Wong et al., 2010 ). For neutralization assays, Vero cells were seeded at 6.0 310 4cells/well and cultured overnight in Eagle's minimal essential medium (EMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine (FBS) and 100 mg/ml streptomycin at 37/C14C and 5% CO 2. The next day, virus was incubated with serial 3-fold antibody dilutions beginning at 330 nM ( /C2450mg/ml) in serum-free EMEM for one hour at room temperature before infecting Vero cell mono- layers in 96-well plates. The amount of virus used for infection was determined based on titration of viral stock to achieve 35%-50% nal infection in control wells without antibody (MOI /C240.1 infectious units per cell). The virus was incubated with the cells in 50% v/v/ EMEM supplemented and 5% CO 2for 14-16 hours before the cells were xed and the nuclei stained with Hoescht. rVSV infectivity was measured by counting EGFP-positive cells in comparison to the total number of cells indicated by nuclear staining using a Cellinsight CX5 automated microscope and accompanying software (Thermo Scientic). The infection level in control wells lacking antibody was set to 100% and the infection was normalized to thatvalue for each antibody dilution, which were tested in triplicate. The mean value was determined and the full 9-point dilution curve was used to determine the half-maximal inhibitor concentration, IC 50using GraphPad Prism version 6. Antibodies having IC 50%5n M were considered strong neutralizers whereas antibodies having 5 nM < IC 50< 50 nM and %50 nM were considered moderate neutralizers and weak/non-neutralizers, respectively. The un-neutralized fraction, an indicator of antibody potency, was also determined using antibodies at the highest concentration tested, 330 nM, and measuring the GFP signal relative to that of untreated control cells. Those that reduced the signal by R98%, 50%-98%, and less than 50% were considered strong, moderate, and weak/non-neutralizers, respectively. Antibody-mediated protection of mice challenged with mouse-adapted EBOV To gauge antibody protection, a previously described mouse-adapted EBOV mouse model, developed at the U.S. Army MedicalResearch Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) was used ( Bray et al., 1998; Gibb et al., 2001 ). Assays were performed either at USAMRIID or Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). Female BALB/c mice, aged 6 to 8 weeks-old (Charles River Laboratory) were housed in microisolator cages and given chow and water ad libitum. On day 0 of the assay, the mice were transferred to a biosafety level (BSL) level 4 containment area and challenged intraperitoneally mouse-adapted EBOV (Mayinga isolate, x LD 50(PHAC)). On day 2 post-infection, groups of 10 mice were treated intraper- itoneally with 100 mg(/C245 mg/kg) mAb per mouse. Mice were observed daily for signs of disease and group weights were recorded daily through day 14 and again on days 21 and 28. Mice were observed for at least 21 days after virus exposure, and protection is expressed as the percentage of mice surviving at the end of a 28 day period. For each round of experiments, 0%-20% of mice that received PBS alone survived challenge. All animal work involving infectious live virus was performed in the BSL-4 laboratories atUSAMRIID or PHAC. At USAMRIID, all work with animals was conducted in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and otherFederal statutes and regulations relating to animals and experiments involving animals and adhered to the principles stated in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, NRC Publication, 1996 edition. All procedures were reviewed and approved by the appropriate Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at USAMRIID. Work performed at PHAC was approved by the Ca-nadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health Animal Care Committee following the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Immune effector assays Antibody mediated cellular phagocytosis by human were with 5 mg/ml for 2 (huADCP) or 1 (mADCP) hr at 37 /C14C before human (THP-1, 2.5 3104cells/well) or mouse (RAW264.7, 1.0 3105cells/well) monocytic cells were added and incubated for 18 (huADCP) or 1 (mADCP) hr at 37/C14C. Following xation, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using a BD LSR2 flow cytometer. Data were analyzed using FlowJosoftware. A phagocytic score describing relative phagocytic activity was calculated as: Phagocytic score = (%FITC+ cells x MFI of FITC+ cells)/10,000 where MFI is the mean fluorescence intensity of all FITC+ cells. Each phagocytic score was also compared to that for a non-specic/irrelevant antibody and a control reaction lacking antibody that were both performed in the same experiment to account for cell/donor variability. Cell 174, 938-952.e1-e6, were incubated with 5 mg/ml mAbs for 2 hours at 37/C14C before neutrophils isolated from either human peripheral blood or bone marrow from BALB/c mice were added at 5.0 3104cells/well or 1.03105cells/well, respectively, and incubated at 37/C14C for 1 hour. The cells were then stained for markers of neutrophils (human neutrophils were data analysis and calculation of a phagocytic score were performed as described for the ADCP assays. Antibody-mediated NK cell degranulation and activation Human NK cells were enriched from human peripheral blood samples using negative selection with RosetteSep (Stem Cell Technol- ogies) followed by Ficoll separation. Maxisorp ELISA plates were rst coated with ZEBOV GP DTM (3 mg/ml) before blocking with incubation with 5 mg/ml mAbs at 37/C14C for 2 hours. The mAbs were removed by washing and NK cells (5.0 3104cells/well) in the presence of 10 mg/ml brefeldin A (Sigma Aldrich), GolgiStop (BD), and anti-CD107a were incubated at 37/C14C for 5 hr. The NK cells were then stained for NK surface markers (CD3, CD56, CD16, analyzed with a BD LSR2 flow cytometer and data were analyzed using FlowJo software. Determination of polyfunctionality Polyfunctionality is scored on a scale of 0-7 that represents the sum of the four phagocytic and three natural killer functions elicited. One point was given for each phagocytic or NK function measured for which the activity was above a dened threshold, which was established using the irrelevant antibody control for Ebola-specic antibody responses, the HIV-specic b12 (PMID: 11498595). Classication of functional activity into high, moderate, and low Functional responses were divided into ''high,'' ''moderate,'' and ''low/none'' tritiles based 10698744, 23071322) and the HIV-specic or greater to c13C6 were considered ''high,'' and responses equal or less than b12 were considered ''low,'' and responses between b12 and c13C6 were considered ''moderate.'' mAbs that scored medium/high for a given assay were considered functional for that assay. Analysis of antibody glycan content A previously described capillary electrophoresis method was used to determine the relative abundance of antibody glycan structures(Mahan et al., 2015 ). In brief, the Fc region was cleaved from the Fab using the FabRICATOR IdeS (Genovis) and N-linked glycans were removed using peptide-n-glycosidase F (PNGase F, New England BioLabs). The free glycans were then labeled with 50 mM 9-aminopyrene-1,4,6-trisulfonic acid (APTS) in 1.2 M citric acid and 1 M sodium cyanoborohydride in tetrahydrofuran (THF). Excess dye was removed using a size exclusion resin before loading onto a 3130XL Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) equipped with a36 cm capillary array with POP-7 polymer. Peaks for 19 substructures were identied and the relative abundance of each structure was determined by calculating the area under the curve for each peak and dividing by the total area of all peaks. QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSES Machine learning and statistical analyses The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to identify differences between different epitope classes. Dunn's test was used to identify pairwisedifferences. Multiple hypothesis testing was corrected for using false discovery rate. Pairwise Spearman's calculations and hypoth- esis testing was done in R. The interactive network at https://apps.vhmmunotherapy.org/corrnetwork to visualize the pairwise Spearman's coefcients was used to build and evaluate machine learning classiers for the classication task. All features in the dataset were centered and scaled before training the algorithms. As part of data preprocessing, the fusion, GP1/Head and HR2 epitope classes that had near-zero variance were removed from the dataset. The isotype feature was also removed since 100 of the 101 hu-man-derived mAbs were IgG1, which could lead to overestimation of the importance of a certain isotype subset. Values for the unneutralized fraction of rVSV-EBOV were transformed to represent the instantaneous inhibitory potential (IIP). The code used for the analysis and to build the applications used to explore the dataset is hosted at: https://andersen-lab.github.io/VIC-Analysis/ . The Python scikit-learn package was used for machine learning predictions of levels of protection conferred by antibodies based on antibody features ( Pedregosa et al., 2011 ). The ExtraTreesRegressor ( Geurts algorithm ( Breiman, was used as as EC 50were transformed to Log10 values. RF prediction accuracy was calculated using 10-fold cross-validation. e6 Cell 174, 938-952.e1-e6, August 9, 2018Supplemental Figures Figure S1.

Survival Curves for in vivo Protection Assay, Related to Figure 3 mAbs tested at USAMRIID facilities were assayed in 12 rounds. The mice were treated with 100 mg/ml antibodies on day 2 post-infection and were observed and weighed across a 28 day period. mAbs tested at Public Health Agency of Canada (Manitoba) were tested in one round. The mice were treated with 100 mg/ml antibodies on day 2 post-infection and observed for a total of 21 days.Figure Binding to Wild-Type (WT) Related to Figure 3 mAbs from K-means cluster groups 1, 2, 4, and 5 ( Figure 4 ) were tested for binding to both WT and mouse adapted EBOV GP. The mAbs included Cluster 1 mAb VIC 115, which protected in vivo but did not neutralize. HEK293T cells were transfected with constructs expressing wild-type GP, mouse-adapted GP, or empty vector, and mAb binding was detected by flow cytometry, as described for alanine scanning epitope mapping. Data shown are the average and standard de-viation of four measurements of binding, expressed as relative light units (RLU).Figure S5.
