Our favourite blog posts What others are saying I had a great yoga summer with Ram and Mahima with some fantastic classes in many yoga styles. The wonderful thing here is that everybody, from beginner to advanced can find the right level of practice. Ram and Mahima, you are really great, you made my yoga summer! Thank you very much! Grassroots Yoga classes offer a blend of traditional and modern yoga catering for our busy lifestyles. I found Ram and Karen to be very friendly and helpful, they both have a thorough knowledge of yoga and are often found in India upgrading their skills! They deliver guided instruction in a safe and caring environment, what I like most and what makes their classes stand out is the addition of pranayama (breath work) and some form of gentle meditation which leaves you feeling grounded, restored and relaxed . Classes are not only great for beginners but can be as advanced as you care to make , as many alternative poses are given. So basically, a wonderful class for any level or mood you are feeling - totally recommend their classes. Mahima quickly became one of my favourite yoga teachers because of her nurturing voice and her dynamic, creative yoga sequences. She creates such an open and warm space for me to really go deep into my personal experience. The way she instructs each posture is so clear I can completely surrender and feel so held. I like that she focuses on the core because when I leave her classes I not only feel super relaxed, but really strong and grounded in the centre of my being. She really lives, breaths and embodies the essence of yoga \u2014 love.\" Follow "}
