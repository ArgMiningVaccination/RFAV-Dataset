Justin, Bill, and James at this location and they are terrific. In the winters, I escape and spend 4 to 5 months in Florida and The Joint is equally as convenient and competent there, so I'm lucky to have outstanding service in 2 different states. All of the Doctors I've experienced have been able to get me back in alignment within a short period of time and I appreciate their attention to detail and will spend whatever time it takes to fix me up. This is an outstanding practice. - Nina B. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (412) 927-4613 8874 Covenant Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15237 5 5 1 I felt like I was missing my right arm because of bad blood circulation due to misaligned C6 and C7. Dr. Nick Heasley, D.C. did an adjustment that put those bones back in place. He is very knowledgeable and Professional with clients. - Nina B. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (412) 927-4613 8874 Covenant Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15237 5 5 1 My C1 bone in the neck was misaligned for a long time causing me very bad headaches, finally after Dr. Shemenski's adjustment I stopped having headaches that I suffered from for months. I recommend this chiropractor for more serious work. - John Meyers The Joint Chiropractic $$ (412) 927-4613 8874 Covenant Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15237 5 5 1 Just found out about this new approach to chiropractic visits. First visit with Dr Bill was very enlightening. I have been seeing different back Drs and Accupuncture practices for about a year and a half. Little to no relief of my hip and lower back pain. One visit with Bill and I have had an enormous amount of relief. Plus the education he gave me on the muscles that were causing the issue was great. Thanks a bunch. - Amber S. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (412) 927-4613 8874 Covenant Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15237 5 5 1 (I started with) very long term pain with intermittent relief. I was told to seek Chiropractic, Physical Therapy, a pain specialist, Neuro, and Nutritionist. (The doctor at The Joint) explained ALL of them in one comprehensive action plan.. 5 docs to 1! Thank you, excited to start this journey. - Eugene \"Gene\" W. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (412) 927-4613 8874 Covenant Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15237 5 5 1 I am a weightlifter and fitness guy, and wanted to improve my overall wellness. The doctors at The Joint help me do all the activities I love. They have treated all of my injuries as well. I'm a big fan. - Joshua D. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (412) 927-4613 8874 Covenant Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15237 5 5 1 My wife made me come in. However I'm glad I did. - Talor D. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (412) 927-4613 8874 Covenant Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15237 5 5 1 When I walked into the Joint Chiropractic I could barely move let alone stand up. After one visit I felt 100% better. I've been coming in weekly ever since. - John DiMaria The Joint Chiropractic $$ (412) 927-4613 8874 Covenant Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15237 5 5 1 I've had 3 adjustments at this office since being back in town, two from Dr. James and one from Dr. Justin. Both Drs. are EXCELLENT....and I'm sure the 3rd Dr. (who I've yet to meet) is just as good. I initially went to a Joint clinic in Florida and received excellent care there, and am pleased that Pittsburgh has an office, one that doesn't require me to go through a tunnel or through the city to get to it.....I highly recommend this practice. They take the time to listen to your concerns and I find the adjustments have been spot-on every time. These folks know what they are doing and they are prompt, courteous, friendly and darn good at what they do!! - Katie G. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (412) 927-4613 8874 Covenant Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15237 5 5 1 I have been coming here for years. They are friendly and professional. - James S. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (412) 927-4613 8874 Covenant Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15237 5 5 1 Sought out chiropractic care due to injury. I continue care because it brings me comfort! I would recommend The Joint McCandless Crossing to friends and family. - Sherry N. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (412) 927-4613 8874 Covenant Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15237 5 5 1 Service is always prompt and effective. I like the ability to just walk in. - Jay McCorkle The Joint Chiropractic $$ (412) 927-4613 8874 Covenant Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15237 3 5 1 I live between Pa and AZ. and signed for the $69 for 4 visit plan.So often times, in Az for weeks at a time. Very satisfied with Dr. Sites adjustments. When folks sign up, maybe stress that unused visits don't carry over to the next month. I had to eat 2 visits because of this policy. I admit to not reading\" fine print \". They lose a patient over hard nose position. Nothing like working with someone ???? - Sean Kirzyc The Joint Chiropractic $$ (412) 927-4613 8874 Covenant Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15237 5 5 1 I had been quarantined to my basement for over a week. Sleeping on an old couch my lower back inevitably slipped out. ON A SUNDAY. 99% of chiropractic offices do not operate on weekends.. I could barley walk when I arrived and Dr. Sites had me walking with minimal pain in 15 minutes. I am so grateful that you are open to the people on a Sunday! From the moment I arrived to the end of the visit, the experience was as Gold Standard as it gets. I start back at work today and thanks to this team I can function!!! THANK YOU! - Sarah L. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (412) 927-4613 8874 Covenant Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15237 5 5 1 The Joint Chiropractic care has greatly improved my overall well being. It is affordable and well worth what they charge for fees. They have counseled me on various exercises/stretches to improve my mobility. Most recently they have recommended a joint supplement that has made my daily life a ton more smooth. It is by far a most wonderful product for overall wellness of the joints. All I can say is THANK YOU for the advice. - Christina M. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (412) 927-4613 8874 Covenant Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15237 5 5 1 I first came because my back was bothering me to the point that I wasn't able to sleep. My fiance is actually the one that scheduled me for my first visit. I have been loving coming ever since. I work right down the hill so it's nice and convenient for me. I can even come on my lunch breaks! I have recommended The Joint to my coworkers and I will continue to. - Cheryl M. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (412) 927-4613 8874 Covenant Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15237 5 5 1 The Joint Chiropractic has been a game changer for me...affordable and convenient. With chronic lower back pain, weekly adjustments are a must for me so that I can maintain my exercise routine. The Wellness Plan makes preventive care so easy. Great hours of operation so that I can make it in late evenings during the week after work. The service is excellent. An added bonus for me is that Dr. Shemenski is a distance runner so in addition to excellent chiropractic care...I get great running advice too. If you don't regularly see a chiropractor for preventive maintenance, I highly recommend The Joint Chiropractic! - Sandy C. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (412) 927-4613 8874 Covenant Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15237 5 5 1 I've recommended quite a few of my friends to The Joint. I've had back issues since going full term with twins. The guys at The Joint know exactly what to do. I was amazed after just one visit how great I felt. I also love the fact that you don't need appointments. If I have an evening where I have time, I'm able to go without wondering if they can see me. Love this place. Everyone is so nice :) - Levi G. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (412) 927-4613 8874 Covenant Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15237 5 5 1 The staff at The Joint have been more than helpful in my recovery from a muscular injury. They have provided me with excellent chiropractic care as well as stretches, routines, muscular therapy and preventative measures to get me back to my active lifestyle. I couldn't thank the doctors at The Joint enough. - Jason G. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (412) 927-4613 8874 Covenant Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15237 5 5 1 Staff is super friendly and treat you like a family member, not just a patient. No hidden expenses or increasing costs. Flexible plans to fit my schedule. Clear communication of problems and what to do to prevent further injury. - Greg W. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (412) 927-4613 8874 Covenant Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15237 5 5 1 I've been coming to see the Doctors here at The Joint for over a year and I've never had my back feel better than it does now. Not only do they diagnose and adjust, but they give me stretching exercises as well. The best part is the price and not having to deal with insurance companies. - Deanna T. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (412) 927-4613 8874 Covenant Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15237 5 5 1 I absolutely love The Joint in McCandless. The staff is friendly and the environment is nice. I seeked out The Joint because of low back pain. When I leave, I have relief. I strongly feel this helps me at my job. I also love the option to go to another site in another state when I am on the road. - Ryan K. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (412) 927-4613 8874 Covenant Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15237 5 5 1 The Joint Chiropractic works perfectly for me. Due to the nature of my job, scheduling is very hard for me, so the walk-in process is awesome. The Dr's are very professional and very helpful. I have nothing but great things to say about The Joint. - Pamela S. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (412) 927-4613 8874 Covenant Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15237 5 5 1 I've been going to The Joint ever since it opened three years ago and I love it. I've had back and neck issues for a long time and the care that I've received here has alleviated the pain quite a bit. The chiropractors are very caring and knowledgeable. I go once a week for prevention now, and it's the best investment for my health that I've ever made. - Sharon S. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (412) 927-4613 8874 Covenant Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15237 5 5 1 My first visit to Dr. Shemenski was just the beginning of a relationship that I just can't live without. He listens, and more importantly has the knowledge and expertise to \"fix\" me no matter the issue. My range of motion has increased, and he has managed to do this while working around shoulder injuries. THE BEST! - Amy W. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (412) 927-4613 8874 Covenant Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15237 5 5 1 My first experience with a chiropractor. The Joint has been convenient, affordable and effective. - Lauren G.

The friendliness of the staff and cost effective approach to chiropractic care are added bonuses. I highly recommend The Joint. - Daniel T. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (412) 927-4613 8874 Covenant Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15237 5 5 1 I hurt my back when I was young. Never went to a Chiropractor until now.

The Joint Chiropractic $$ (412) 927-4613 8874 Covenant Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15237 5 5 1 Prior to coming to The Joint, I would constantly have back tightness and pain. Walking through the doors here almost 2 years ago was one of the best health related decisions I have made! - Kim B. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (412) 927-4613 8874 Covenant Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15237 5 5 1 I was having shoulder pain after having surgery, and I came here after someone at work suggested it. The staff is wonderful, the price is reasonable, and the hours-I can get here after work- keep the hours! - Olivia S. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (412) 927-4613 8874 Covenant Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15237 5 5 1 I discovered The Joint because I suffer from severe migraines and wanted to get some relief. Everyone at The Joint is extremely helpful, friendly and genuinely want you to feel better. My migraines occur less frequently and I believe it's because I'm receiving regular chiropractic care. I highly recommend The Joint. - Stephanie C. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (412) 927-4613 8874 Covenant Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15237 5 5 1 I have had chiropractic care in a few other places. Once I moved to PA 2 years ago, the care I received was not what I was looking for, nor personality match. I came across The Joint 8 months ago and gave them a shot. I was hooked from the start. Never an appointment needed. Customer service has always been top notch. And lastly, the Doctors are incredible. Extremely knowledgeable and helpful. I have recommended them to tons of people and will continue to do so. - Roddy S. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (412) 927-4613 8874 Covenant Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15237 5 5 1 I came here after hurting my back. No appointment. Took me right in. People are so nice and professional.

The Joint Chiropractic $$ (412) 927-4613 8874 Covenant Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15237 5 5 1 My husband and I have both been coming here for about a year. The doctors are friendly and do a great job; Liz at the front desk has the best memory for names I know and the hours fit well with our schedule. We've both been getting chiropractic care for years and the Joint is quality care and convenience that's perfect for a busy lifestyle. - Cassidy M. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (412) 927-4613 8874 Covenant Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15237 5 5 1 I've had upper back and neck pain for many years.

Great experiences always. - William W. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (412) 927-4613 8874 Covenant Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15237 5 5 1 I have been going to the Joint for almost four years now. I started going in LA and love that it has locations across the country as I travel occasionally. When I was transferred to the Pittsburgh area, the first thing I did was locate a Joint location in the area. The Joint in McCandless is one of the best I've been to and the staff and Doctors are great! I would, and have, recommended the joint to everyone. - Katherine K. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (412) 927-4613 8874 Covenant Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15237 5 5 1 I dedicate a lot of my time to running, specifically marathon training. When I'm running mileage of up to 100 miles a week it's important for me to get all the \"little things\" right to prevent injury. In the past I've been hampered by hip/hamstring pain that would prevent me from racing. Since the addition of weekly visits to The Joint, I've been able to successfully run injury free. I'd recommend the Joint to everyone, especially athletes. I can't imagine it not being part of my weekly routine. - Christina C. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (412) 927-4613 8874 Covenant Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15237 5 5 1 I've been seeing chiropractors since I was a teenager for back pain resulting in headaches. Until recently, I quit seeing someone due to moving frequently and an otherwise busy schedule, resulting in headaches, stiffness and pain returning. I'm so glad I found the Joint! Their payment plans are easy, the staff is friendly, it's overall a great place that I actually enjoy coming to!! Not to mention, I feel great when I leave. I recommend the Joint to everyone I know who would benefit from their care! - Tammy L.

The Joint Chiropractic $$ (412) 927-4613 8874 Covenant Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15237 5 5 1 I came in for leg pain. Great Service. Would recommend! Very knowledgeable.

For years, I've had issues with my back \"locking up\" on me, and the treatment I receive here keeps me moving and loose. The frequency of back issues is much lower since I started receiving treatment, and when they do occur, they go away much more quickly. The staff at The Joint McCandless Crossing treats us like life-long friends and that keeps us coming back week after week. - Edward K.
