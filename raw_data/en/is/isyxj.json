Compared to traditional medicine, which focuses on the physical body, Chinese medicine addresses the balance of energy called qi (pronounced \"chee\") and how it affects the body phys - ically, emotionally and spiritually. This healing art is one type of complementary and alternative medicine that's becoming more widely accepted and used along with traditional medicine in healthcare facilities across the nation. At Carolinas HealthCare, we have our own unique facility, SouthPark Acupuncture, led by licensed acupuncturist Wenhui Li, L.Ac. HoW Acupuncture Works Qi flows through the body along pathways called meridians. Each meridian corresponds with a particular organ system. Acupuncture points on the meridians are precise areas where focus is directed to treat specific con - ditions. \"In Chinese medicine, it is believed that disease is linked to excess, deficiency or obstruction of qi's natural flow,\" Li says. \"Acupuncture aims to regulate the move - ment of qi to correct the energy's imbalance so that the body can heal itself.\" Need proof? According to the World Health Organization, acupuncture is proven to treat conditions and chronic pain disorders such as fibromyalgia, back and neck pain, migraines, carpal tunnel syndrome and arthritis. WHAt to expect During treatment, sterile hair-fine needles are inserted at key points on your skin. You may feel a minor sensa - tion but no pain or side effects. The needles stimulate deep sensory nerves that tell your brain to release body chemi - cals, such as endorphins, hormones and opioids, which act as painkillers to relieve pain and improve the body's immune system. Afterward, most patients experience relief from discomfort and feel relaxed, calm or energized. Pain is often greatly reduced after just a few treatments. All about acupuncture Visit tod Ay!

Thirty-seven states now have laws that ban smoking from work - places, restaurants and bars. And soon, you'll need to think twice before lighting up in North Carolina. Effective January 2, 2010, a smoking ban will prohibit puffing in public places, government-owned buildings and vehicles, and places of employment. Why the ban? Each year, more than 430,000 people die from tobacco-related diseases, making it the leading cause of preventable death. An additional 50,000 people die from exposure to secondhand smoke, and more than 1,000 children become smokers each day. If you smoke, this ban may motivate you to kick the habit. Need more help?

The department follows national guidelines to identify and care for a person who may be experiencing a heart attack. In particular, the ED staff works to reduce a patient's time-to-treatment during the critical early stages of a heart attack, when treatment is most effective. GEttin G tHE RiGHt tREatMEnt As a CPC, CMC-Pineville works with local emergency medical services (EMS) to care for a person who has chest pain. (If you or a loved one has chest pain, experts recommend calling 911 and traveling to a hospital by ambulance, not by car.) Most EMS personnel are trained to use electrocardio - grams, providing confirmation of a suspected heart attack. CMC-Pineville can also prepare for a patient's immediate referral to a catheterization lab for lifesaving treatment. That's important, since bringing a patient to a hospital that's fully equipped to treat heart attacks means he or she won't have to be moved to another facility. And through improved monitoring, the ED staff ensures a patient isn't sent home early or admitted to the hospital unnecessarily. aRE yOu at RiSK? take our quick and confidential risk assessment to determine if you may have heart disease. visit www.cmc-pineville.org/heartaware .Uncompromising Excellence.

And because you may be accustomed to some monthly pelvic discomfort, you might not realize that your symptoms are different. \"Make an appointment with your doctor if your pain changes, worsens, affects your daily life or comes with new symptoms,\" says Stephen Bale, MD, a gynecolo - gist with Piedmont GYN/OB. Some common causes of pelvic pain include: \u00d1 Endometriosis. When endometrial tissue grows outside of the uterus on your ovaries, fallopian tubes or other pelvic structures, it may cause pain, cramping and painful periods with heavy bleeding. You may also have back or abdominal pain; pain with bowel movements or urination; or pain during intercourse. \u00d1 Fibroids. One in four women with these benign uterine tumors experiences symptoms including pelvic pressure or pain, heavy or prolonged periods, spotting, frequent urination, constipation and back or leg pain. \u00d1 Ovarian cysts. If you have ovarian cysts, you may feel a dull ache that radiates to your lower back and thighs, heaviness in your abdomen or pressure on your rectum or bladder. Most cysts disappear after a few menstrual cycles, but sometimes one will continue to grow and may rupture or twist, causing sudden, sharp or worsening pelvic or abdominal pain. \u00d1 Pelvic inflammatory disease. This bacterial infection may cause pain in your lower belly, a fever, irregular bleeding, an unusual vaginal discharge or pain during intercourse. WE Can HELP Don't put up with pelvic pain. \"See your doctor for a thorough exam during which he or she may also check for bladder or other infections, pregnancy, irritable bowel syndrome or nerve disorders.

But at his weight, the 49-year-old York, S.C., resident knew there was no way he was going to be around to see his son get married and start a family. Without really realizing it, he had packed on the pounds, he says. He didn't have any weight-related health problems and was never short of breath. But Tony found himself at a crossroads: Keep going down the same unhealthy path, or lose the weight. He chose the latter. MAkinG Good on A pro Mise Ask Tony what he weighed, and he won't tell. It's too embarrassing, he says. But this is what he will say: In seven months, he dropped 110 pounds. And he's only 10 or 15 pounds away from his goal weight. His life changed the day his employer, MacLean Power, brought Carolinas Medical Center Corporate Health's On-site Medical Management Program on board. The on-site clinic is staffed with either a nurse practitioner or a physician assistant. It's run by CMC Corporate Health, which works with employers to iden - tify health risks among employees, and to treat employees for chronic health conditions such as obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure. The clinic supports employees in working toward healthier lifestyles ( see \"The key is prevention\" ). To motivate workers to lose weight, CMC Corporate Health also ran a \"Biggest Loser Weight Loss Challenge,\" which started in February 2009. In this con - test, Tony saw his opportunity to turn his life around.\"Tony had a lot working against him,\" says Heather Shiflett, PA, the physician assistant who works for CMC Corporate Health and created the contest. \"You burn the most fat while you're sleeping, so if you work nights like Tony does, you tend not to do as well with weight loss.\" Shiflett says she was inspired to create \"Biggest Loser\" by her own family's struggle with obesity and her days spent as a teacher, when she saw first-graders who weighed more than her 120 pounds. During the 15-week challenge, Shiflett offered nutri - tional advice to Tony and the other MacLean employees. \"Many people really didn't trust me when I told them all the things they could eat and still lose weight,\" she laughs. \"They were afraid to eat that much.\" Besides his family, Tony says Shiflett was a big source of motivation for him to lose the weight.

He also drank 60 to 80 ounces of water a day and weighed in every week. At the end of the contest, he was crowned the \"biggest loser\" out of 15 MacLean contestants, after dropping more than 65 pounds through diet alone. He went on to lose 45 more pounds. It was just something he felt he had to do, and he's reaped the rewards\u2014more energy and self-esteem. keepin G At it Like almost everyone who lost weight through the contest, Tony has maintained his weight within a few pounds. He plans to start an exercise program to shed those last few pounds, but he won't say when. He believes setting deadlines just sets you up for failure. People approach him all the time, asking how he lost so much weight. \"I tell them you have to figure out your motivation, you have to want to do it,\" he says. He knows his motivation. At one point during the weight-loss challenge, he was discouraged when more than a week went by and he had only lost one pound. He texted his wife: \"Why am I doing this?\" His son picked up Mom's phone and texted back, \"Dad, don't forget, like you've always told me, 'Hang in there.' You've got to keep going.\" \"I still have that message,\" Tony says.
