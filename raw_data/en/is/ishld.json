This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com Abstract Background The physical impacts of elite sport partici- pation have been well documented; however, there is comparatively less research on the mental health and psy- chological wellbeing of elite athletes. Objective This review appraises the evidence base regarding the mental health and wellbeing of elite-level athletes, including the incidence and/or nature of mental ill-health and substance use. Methods A systematic search of the PubMed, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, PsycINFO, Cochrane and Google Scholar databases, up to and including May 2015, was conducted. Results The search yielded a total of 2279 records. Fol- lowing double screening, 60 studies were included. The ndings suggested that elite athletes experience a broadly comparable risk of high-prevalence mental disorders (i.e. anxiety, depression) relative to the general population. Evi- dence regarding other mental health domains (i.e. eating disorders, substance use, stress and coping) is less consistent. These results are prefaced, however, by the outcome of the quality assessment of the included studies, whichdemonstrated that relatively few studies (25 %) were well reported or methodologically rigorous. Furthermore, there is a lack of intervention-based research on this topic. Conclusion The evidence base regarding the mental health and wellbeing of elite athletes is limited by a paucity of high-quality, systematic studies. Nonetheless, the research demonstrates that this population is vulnerable to a range of mental health problems (including substance misuse), which may be related to both sporting factors (e.g. injury, overtraining and burnout) and non-sporting factors. More high-quality epidemiological and intervention studies are needed to inform optimal strategies to identify and respond to player mental health needs. Key Points The evidence base regarding the mental health and wellbeing of elite athletes is limited by a paucity of high-quality, systematic studies, including intervention trials. On the basis of current evidence, elite athletes appear to experience a broadly comparable risk of high- prevalence mental disorders relative to the general population. A greater risk of disorder may be experienced by elite athletes who are injured, approaching/in retirement or experiencing performance difculty. While the importance of elite athlete mental health is gaining increasing attention, targeted, disorder- specic models of care are yet to be established for this group. There is scope for such models to capitalise on early-intervention principles and establish cross-discipline collaboration.Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi: 10.1007/s40279-016-0492-2 ) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. &Simon M.

There is comparatively less research on, but growing interest in, the mental health and psychological wellbeing of elite-level athletes [ 1-3]. The prevalence of diagnosable psychiatric disorders in this populationremains a matter of debate [ 4]; however, notions that elite athletes are devoid of mental health problems have been increasingly scrutinised by sports medicine practitioners[5]. The intense mental and physical demands placed on elite athletes are a unique aspect of a sporting career, andthese may increase their susceptibility to certain mental health problems and risk-taking behaviours [ 9]. Further- more, the peak competitive years for elite athletes [ 10] tend to overlap with the peak age for the risk of onset of mental disorders [ 11,12]. In addition to physical and competition stress, elite athletes face a unique array of 'workplace'stressors, including the pressures of increased public scrutiny through mainstream and social media, limited support networks due to relocation, group dynamics inteam sports and the potential for injuries to end careers prematurely [ 13-17]. The ways by which athletes appraise and cope with these stressors can be a powerful determi-nant of the impact the stressors have on both their mental health and their sporting success [ 18]. Athletes tend not to seek s upport for mental health problems, for reasons such as stigma, lack of under- standing about mental health and its potential influence on performance, and the percep tion of help seeking as a sign of weakness [ 12,19]. While there have been efforts to disseminate sport-related me ntal health ndings in order to advance the prevention, identication and early treat-ment of psychopathology in elite athletes, there are sug- gestions that some sporting governing bodies continue to minimise the signicance of mental ill-health in thispopulation [ 19]. This has sobering implications if elite athletes within such organisations are not provided with access to timely or adequate mental health care, or do notfeel that the culture of the spo rting organisation is such that they can even raise thei r mental health concerns. While it is well established that physical activity has apositive effect on mental health [ 6,7], a review has found that intense physical activity performed at the elite athlete level might instead compromise mental wellbeing, increasing symptoms of anxi ety and depression through overtraining, injury and burnout [ 8]. Some, though not all, research suggests that this population has an increasedrisk of mental health problems , including eating disorders [21] and suicide [ 22]. A recent national survey of elite athletes in Australia found that almost half acknowledged symptoms of at least one of the mental health problemsthat were assessed, with prevalence rates similar to those r e p o r t e di nt h ec o m m u n i t y[ 23]. Emerging research sug- gests that retired elite ath letes may be at particularly elevated risk of mental ill-health [ 24], corresponding to both low rates of formal athlete mental health screening processes [ 25] and player perceptions of inadequate availability of ment al health support [ 26]. Given the early-stage state of sports psychiatry and its research base, the current delivery of mental health care for elite athletes might not take into account sport-related factors that potentially influence vulnerability to mentalhealth problems, nor diagnostic or treatment issues that may be unique to this population [ 4,19]. Developing a comprehensive understanding of the mental health andpsychological wellbeing specic to elite athletes has the potential to advance models of care and management of this population, which may, in turn, facilitate performancegains. Such an understanding is required to provide guid- ance for sport practitioners\u2014including coaches, medical staff and sport psychologists\u2014in developing the copingabilities of elite athletes and, in turn, improving their emotional wellbeing [ 20]. 1.1 Objective The utility of systematic reviews to synthesise research on discrete topics and identify gaps in knowledge is well established; however, to date, there have been no such reviews of the mental health and psychological wellbeingof elite athletes. The objective of this review was to syn- thesise the growing evidence base regarding the incidence and nature of mental ill-health (including substance use)and psychological wellbeing among elite-level athletes in order to identify gaps that future research should prioritise, and inform strategies or guidelines to advance the detectionand management of mental ill-health in this population. 2 Methods 2.1 Literature Search A systematic search of ve electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, PsycINFO, Cochrane) wasconducted between January and February 2015, using the relevant database search engines. A subsequent search was conducted using the Google Scholar database in May 2015to ensure that all recently published articles meeting the1334 S. M. Rice et al. 123inclusion criteria were identied. The search strategy for each database, MeSH descriptors and corresponding num- ber of hits per database are presented in Electronic Sup- plementary Material Tables S1 and S2. 2.2 Study Inclusion Three researchers independently assessed the eligibility of each retrieved record on the basis of the title and abstract. If the information was unclear, the full-text article was screened. All included studies were subsequently re- screened (i.e. double screened) by a fourth researcher. Theincluded studies were required to meet the following inclusion criteria: (1) participants were currently compet- ing at the elite level, as able-bodied athletes, where the elitelevel was dened a priori to be competitive at either the Olympic, international, national or professional level; (2) the study reported quantitative data on a mental health,wellbeing or coping outcome; and (3) the study was pub- lished in English. Studies were excluded from the review on the basis of the following criteria: (1) the mean age ofthe participants was \\18 years; (2) participants were competing at a school or collegiate level; (3) the study was undertaken with a heterogeneous sample (i.e. a mixedsample of elite and non-elite athletes) without reporting group ndings separately; (4) the study assessed only physiological wellbeing or stress responses withoutassessing or reporting psychological wellbeing; (5) the study was available in abstract form only (i.e. conference presentations), precluding full quality assessment; and(6) the study described substance use focused on perfor- mance enhancement (i.e. doping) as opposed to personal use. The systematic review was conducted in accordancewith the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (see Fig. 1for flow diagram). 2.3 Data Extraction A standardised data extraction template was designed. One researcher sourced the required information from the inclu- ded studies, using this template, including the study type anddesign, sport population, study aim, sex ratio and key out- comes mapped to study measures and main ndings. 2.4 Quality Appraisal Given the heterogeneity of the included study designs and the lack of randomised, controlled trials identied in the search process (see Sect. 3.2), it was not possible to con- duct a standard risk-of-bias assessment. In place of this, allstudies were appraised for reporting quality based on the established standards outlined below.3 Results 3.1 Literature Search The literature search yielded a total of 2279 records. After screening of the titles and abstracts, 103 studies wereidentied as likely meeting the inclusion criteria. After double screening, exclusion of qualitative studies and a nal manual search of the literature (i.e. screening of ref-erences lists), a total of 60 studies were included in the quantitative synthesis (see Fig. 1for the study selection diagram). 3.2 Study Design Sixty quantitative studies were included in the review. The study designs varied, though most were either cross-sec- tional observational studies ( N=38; 63.3 %), longitudinal studies N=11; 18.3 %) or of a mixed-method design (N=8; 13.3 %). In addition, there were one randomised, controlled trial (1.6 %), one meta-analysis and one inter-vention case study report. Given the heterogeneity of both the study designs and the outcome variables that were assessed, it was not possible to conduct a meta-analysis aspart of this review. 3.3 Quality AppraisalThe methodological rigour of the included studies was assessed according to relevant published criteria [ 27,28]. Quality appraisal of the 60 studies is presented in Elec- tronic Supplementary Material Table S3. Only two studies met all methodological criteria, with one quarter ( N=15; 25 %) assessed to be of good reporting quality (i.e.2,038 records excluded as not meeting criteria2,204 records identified through database searching 2,141 after duplicates removed 2,141 records screened 43 full text articles excluded103 full text articles assessed for eligibility 60 studies included in narrative synthesis64 additional records identified through manual search Fig. 1 Study selection flow diagramMental Health of Elite Athletes 1335 123scoring C4 out of 5). The mean quality rating was 2.88 (standard deviation 0.87). Over one third of the remaining studies ( N=21; 45 %) were assessed to be of moderate quality (scoring 3 out of 5), while 24 studies (40 %) wereassessed to be of low quality (scoring 2 out of 5). Almost all included studies ( N=59) dened their participants well and either reported use of standardised, validatedquestionnaires or clearly described the outcomes measured. Fewer than half of the included studies clearly reported ethical review ( N=27) and either reported a participant rate of more than 80 % or, in the absence of that, provided a description comparing responders with non-responders(N=25). Over one quarter of the included studies did not report on the participant rate ( N=16), and very few used random sampling ( N=3). 3.4 Description of Included Studies Tables 1,2,3,4,5,6,7provide a summary of the key characteristics and main outcomes of the 60 included studies. For the purposes of reporting and analysis, studieswere grouped according to the following major mental health constructs: anger and aggression ( N=2) [29,30], anxiety ( wellbeing ( N=1) [63]. The included studies examined athletes from a broad range of individual sports (e.g. swimming, tennis, wrestling) and team-based sports(e.g. soccer, football, rugby), with some studies including elite athletes from a range of sporting disciplines. 3.4.1 Main Findings Of the two included studies that focused on anger and aggression (see Table 1), one was conducted with rugbyplayers [ 29], while the other was a case study of an elite table tennis player [ 30]. Anger tended to be experienced rel- atively frequently by the rugby players, was viewed as facil- itative as opposed to debilitative and was positively associatedwith anxiety. In both studies, cognitive aspects (self-con- dence or problem solving) were associated with less expres- sion of anger in competition. No studies were found thatevaluated off-eld expressions of anger or aggression. Four studies focused on anxiety in elite athletes (see Table 2): two on swimmers [ 32,33] and two on athletes from mixed sporting populations [ 31,34]. These studies focused primarily on the performance aspect of symptoms of anxiety (i.e. where athletic performance is evaluated as threatening and is associated with elevated levels of arousal or worry) as opposed to generalised clinical or subclinicalexperiences of non-competitive anxiety, which are sum- marised in the general-prevalence studies listed in Table 4. Athlete interpretation of anxiety states was identied ascritical to the impact of anxiety. For example, a focus on performance (as opposed to cooperation and effort) pre- dicted athlete worry [ 31], while interpretation of anxiety as facilitative was associated with more adaptive anxiety management strategies (i.e. approach-focused coping) [ 32] and performance levels [ 33]. Higher levels of athlete anxiety were also found to be related to negative patterns of perfectionism [ 34]. Recommendations to elite-level coa- ches included development of athlete skills in appraisal andinterpretation of anxiety states [ 32] and the type of training culture facilitated among athletes (i.e. mastery as opposed to performance) [ 31]. Of the ten studies examining eating disorders and body image (see Table 3), six were conducted with mixed popu- lations [ 21,35-37,40,43], two with rowers [ 41,42] and the remaining studies with distance runners [ 38] and g- ure skaters [ 39]. With the exception of the three studies that used an interviewer-administered diagnostic interview [ 35, 40,43], all studies on eating disorders and body image used Table 1 Summary of anger and aggression studies in elite athletes Authors Type Purpose N(male:female) anger197 (197:0) Rugby; Italy Players experienced a moderate frequency of anger symptoms, interpreting these as facilitative rather than debilitative.

Of the ten studies, ve evaluated either eating disorder or body imageissues in comparison with general community samples. The results from these studies were inconsistent. Three reported a higher incidence of eating disorder or body dissatisfaction inelite athletes relative to controls [ 36], especially in sports emphasising leanness or lower body weight [ 21,35]. In contrast, one study found no difference between elite athletes and controls when the sample was restricted to females [ 43]. The included meta-analytic study that examined differencesin body image reported no differences between athletes and non-athletes, or by sex or body mass index [ 37]; however, it must be noted this meta-analysis used homogenous inclusioncriteria incorporating a large number of studies reporting data from non-elite athletes. The remaining studies identied athlete-specic risk factors for eating disorders or bodyimage concerns, including sport-specic body-type demands (i.e. leanness) [ 38-40], age (higher risk in younger athletes) and sex (higher risk in females) [ 41,42]. One study recruiting only males identied onset-related characteristics of eating disorders as commencement of training at an earlier age, dieting and experience of traumatic events, such as signi-cant injury [ 40]. The ten general-prevalence studies on elite athlete mental health (see Table 4) reported data from either mixed samples [ 23,46,50,51] or specic codes, includingfootball [ 44], swimming lifting 47], eques- trian [ 48], distance running [ 49] and tennis [ 52]. Sample sizes for these studies varied on the basis of the population of interest, ranging from N=2067 for a national-level study [ 51]t o N=14 for a study of distance runners. Of note, with the exception of one study utilising a structured diagnostic interview [ 45] and one study utilising clinician diagnoses [ 51], outcomes for general-prevalence studies were based on athlete self-report data from standardised measures. In the studies with larger sample sizes(N[100), combined rates of high-prevalence disorders (i.e. mood or anxiety disorders) were frequently reported. In one large self-report study, up to 46.4 % of Australianathletes ( N=224; a mixed sample) met the clinical cut-off for a diagnosable mental health disorder based on stan- dardised scales, with identied rates of depression(27.2 %), eating disorder (22.8 %) and anxiety disorder (social phobia; 14.7 %) [ 23]. Similar ndings were repor- ted for prevalence rates of depression (34 %) based ondiagnostic interviews undertaken with swimmers [ 45] and self-reported depression and anxiety (26 %) in European football players [ 44], though rates of self-reported depres- sion were lower (15 %) in a mixed sample of German elite athletes [ 50]. Markedly lower case rates, based on clinician diagnosis, were reported from a large French study (amixed sample), with a lifetime prevalence rate for anyTable 2 Summary of anxiety studies in elite athletes Authors Type Purpose N(male:female) Sport; countryMain ndings Abrahamsen et performance anxiety190 (101:89) Various; NorwayFemales reported greater performance worry, concentration disruption and somatic anxiety than males.

This study did, however, report relatively frequent sleep problems (de-layed onset, frequent waking and daytime drowsiness) in 21.5 % of athletes. Major life events, including injury and chronic stress, were associated with higher rates of distress,anxiety and depression [ 23,44,50]. The self-report gen- eral-prevalence studies reporting smaller sample sizes (N\\100) were relatively heterogeneous in outcomes. While male athletes tended to report lower anxiety than their female counterparts, sex differences in depressionwere inconsistent [ 46,48]. Lower ratings of depression and distress were reported in highly achieving athletes [ 47] andin older versus younger female athletes [ 52], with global mood and anxiety predicting athlete performance [ 49]. The studies on elite athlete substance use focused on either alcohol [ 54,59,60], or other drugs [ 55-58,61,62] (see Table 5). Studies related to alcohol use indicated higher rates of consumption in athletes relative to the general community [59,60]. However, during the playing season, the rates of risky alcohol use may be lower than general community levels [ 54]. Studies focusing on illicit drugs suggested rela- tively low use (7-8 %) in the previous year [ 55,56] but signicantly higher combined lifetime use when athletes were asked if they knew other athletes who used illicit drugs(up to 45 %) [ 62].

In terms of drug-related attitudes, there was a tendency for athletes to overestimate levels of drug use in those competing in sports other than their own [56]. One intervention study that examined the long-term effects of an illicit drug-testing programme [ 58] found that rates of positive tests among athletes declined over an extended period, and the authors attributed this to education,harm minimisation and testing frequency. One study exam- ined athlete knowledge regarding the effects of illicit drug use. Despite potential stigma relating to athletes seeking drug-related information (i.e. fellow players or staff assuming that information seeking equates to actual druguse), a substantial proportion of elite athletes expressed a desire to receive additional information regarding the effects of some classes of recreational drugs [ 61]. There were 22 studies examining stress and coping in elite athletes (see Table 6), comprising nine longitudinal studies [ 64-72] and 13 cross-sectional observational stud- ies [73-85]. Injury, errors on the sporting eld, fatigue and club/organisational climate were identied as common sources of stress among elite athletes [ 66,68,69,71,81, 86]. Four studies emphasised the impact of the coach in setting the organisational climate [ 72,82-84], noting the negative implications of a performance culture over amastery culture for athletes' stress. Longitudinal studies found that stress related to injuries, external distractions and fatigue was highest during training periods [ 68-71], while opponents, ofcials/umpires and the crowd were the predominant sources of stress for athletes during compe- tition [ 70]. The majority of the retrieved studies examined the dif- ferent strategies employed by elite athletes to cope with the various stressors that were encountered [ 64-66,70,73-75, 79,80,85]. Adaptive, active coping strategies (such as problem solving, use of imagery, seeking social support and planning ahead) were frequently reported [ 66,71,81]; however, there was a tendency for athletes to engage in less adaptive (i.e. avoidance-coping) strategies when faced with unexpected stressors [ 73,76]. One study [ 79 ] found that coping behaviour varied between sporting types, with athletes in team-based sports more likely to seek social support than individual competitors, and female athletesmore likely to engage in strategies focused on managing affect. Coping strategies based on problem solving and behavioural change were found to be the most effective in managing stress [ 64,70,77] and developing resilience [74]. Emotional reactivity and stressful life events were associated with poor on-eld performance and injury [ 66, 67,75,82]. There were single studies identied for the domains of help seeking [ 11], sleep [ 53] and wellbeing [ 63] (see Table 7). The help-seeking study was the only randomised, controlled trial that met the inclusion criteria. While this small study ( N=59) found no difference between athletes in the intervention conditions and control conditions with regard to attitudes, intentions and behaviours related to mental health help seeking, signicant improvements werenoted in depression and anxiety mental health literacy scores, as well as stigma, at 3-month follow-up [ 11]. The one study examining sleep reported on a small sample ofAustralian Rules footballers ( N=19) and found that match-related interstate air travel exerted relatively mini- mal effects on athlete sleep quality [ 53]. Finally, the study examining athlete wellbeing identied distinct proles, with feeling unappreciated, greater perfectionism and lower self-esteem impacting on athlete general wellbeing[63]. 4 Discussion Researchers have emphasised the limited peer-reviewed literature regarding the mental health and wellbeing of elite athletes [ 9,19]. This narrative systematic review is the rst to synthesise data from the existing knowledge base withthe goal of identifying the incidence and/or nature of mental ill-health and substance use in elite athletes. Given the paucity of research in the eld [ 19], the present review took a broad and inclusive approach to study both out- comes and designs. In doing so, it identied the relatively poor overall quality of study reporting to date and the lackof well-designed, intervention-based research in the area of elite athletes' mental health and wellbeing.

That said, there may be subgroups of athletes at elevated risk of mental ill-health, including those in the retirement phase of their careers [ 44] or those experiencing performance failure [ 45]. As in the general population, major negative life events, including injury [ 23], may increase the risk of mental ill-health in elite athletes [ 50], though focused quantitative studies with adequate follow-up assessment periods are needed to conrm this. Findings regarding the prevalence of eating disorders and body image concerns relative to the general population wereinconsistent. However, there was a tendency for higher vulnerability to these conditions in athletes involved in sports requiring a particularly lean body shape [ 21,35,38- 40] and in female athletes [ 41-43]\u2014the latter being con- sistent with the ndings of general population studies [ 87]. Objective data, based on the results of medical review andtests, would likely assist in the assessment of eating pathologies and help counter the limitations of self-re- porting (i.e. underreporting) [ 88]. Low social support was noted as a key risk factor for general mental ill-health, highlighting the importance of both formal and informal support networks for athletes [ 44,46,66]. All of the included general-prevalence studies were cross-sectional in nature. A natural advance for the eld will be to assess athletes prospectively and better identify factors within thecompetitive spheres (i.e. performance or team success) andnon-competitive spheres (i.e. approach coping, social support) for managing symptoms of mental ill-health.Given the signicant overlap between the competitive years for elite athletes and the peak onset of mental dis- orders [ 10-12], future work should also assess low-preva- lence disorders, such as psychosis or mania, in order to detect and direct at-risk athletes to early-intervention pro- grammes or services. 4.2 Elite Athlete Substance UseContextual factors also appear important for athlete sub- stance use, though more rigorous studies are needed. Forexample, no research has examined illicit substance dependence in elite athletes. Nonetheless, higher rates of alcohol use may occur in elite athletes relative to thegeneral population, though this may be largely due to a binge pattern of consumption during non-competitive or vacation periods [ 54]. Rates of self-reported illicit drug use were relatively low in the previous 12 months (i.e. 8 %) [56], which may be due to rigorous drug-testing procedures [58]. Further targeted research in the domain of athlete substance use is warranted, given the frequent harmful effects (e.g. ghting) reported [ 54] and the possibility of patterns of misuse developing in the transition to retire-ment. Given the possible stigma (i.e. assumed use) asso- ciated with elite athletes seeking drug information, improvements to specic, targeted and accessible (i.e.internet-based) information may be warranted [ 61]. 4.3 Athlete CopingThe literature related to athlete coping is more established than that for mental health outcomes. Most studies evalu-ated coping strategies employed by athletes to manageTable 5 continued Authors Type Purpose N(male:female) Sport; country Main ndings Thomas et al.

[74]Quantitative; cross- sectional, observationalImpact of coping strategies on resilience48 (24:24) Volleyball; BrazilAthletes invited to the Brazilian team showed high levels of resilience. A number of coping skills impacted resilience: personal coping resources, coping with adversity, condenceand motivation, goal setting/mentalpreparation and coachability. Use of coping strategies to overcome problems, having dened goals, and motivation andconcentration during competitions have asignicant impact on development of a resilient prole in elite coping with adversity were the best predictors of injury severity. Copingwith adversity was also a signicant predictors of injury duration.

Perception of a masteryclimate was negatively associated with the coach as a source of distressMental Health of Elite Athletes 1347 123performance-related and non-performance-related stres- sors. In this way, coping was general in nature relative topsychosocial stressors (i.e. managing poor performance, injury or content on social media) rather than specic strategies for coping with a diagnosable disorder. Adaptiveand maladaptive coping strategies were reported, though there was a lack of studies that sought to improve athlete coping. While a small-scale ( N=59), internet-based intervention failed to boost help-seeking-related attitudes, intentions or behaviours, increases were noted in mentalhealth literacy [ 11]\u2014an essential component of the help- seeking process. Given that stigma, poor mental health literacy and negative past experiences of mental health helpseeking are key barriers for elite athletes [ 12], more well- designed studies, drawing on larger samples, are needed. Common athlete-specic stressors noted across studiesincluded injury, poor performance, fatigue and organisa- tional factors, such as the coaching environment and coaching expectations. The consistency of ndings relatedto athlete stressors highlights these areas as potential ave- nues for targeted skills-based intervention programmes, including problem solving [ 70] and resilience training [ 74]. Management of athlete-specic stressors was also highlighted in the included studies focusing on athlete performance-related anxiety. Improved coping may beenabled by coaching staff emphasising a supportive train- ing culture whereby athletes can interpret performance- related anxiety as facilitative, developing approach (asopposed to avoidance) strategies [ 31,32]. Indeed, coaching staff themselves were identied as critical to setting the organisational climate\u2014in turn, impacting on the level ofstress experienced by athletes [ 72,82-84]. Given the positive associations between coaches emphasising a mastery climate relative to a performance climate, futuremental health intervention-based research should ensure the involvement and support of key coaching staff. 4.4 Study Limitations and Future Directions As indicated, the overall study quality in this eld is poor, and heterogeneous study outcomes prevented the applica- tion of meta-analytic techniques. In addition, the nature of participant self-selection may have reduced the represen- tativeness of the ndings. While the included studiesfocused specically on elite-level competition at the national or international level, differences between the included sports in terms of training, remuneration, mediapressure and other salient variables must be considered [89]. Our study did not include athletes with disabilities\u2014a population in which relatively little is known about mentalhealth outcomes. Furthermore, most studies used self-re- porting rather than a diagnostic interview [ 45]; therefore, the extent of psychiatric disorders , as opposed to mental health symptoms or probable 'caseness', in this population remains largely unknown. While some mental health domains were relatively well represented by the includedstudies, other domains\u2014particularly athlete anger and aggression, help seeking and sleep\u2014had very few studies. In addition, the included studies generally failed to includeassessment of athlete psychological strengths , and only one included study assessed wellbeing-related outcomes. Fur- ther, there is a lack of research focusing on the transitionfrom playing or competing in elite sport to retirement. Despite this, the current ndings are useful for informing the next generation of studies focusing on elite athletemental health. The last two decades have witnessed extraordinary progress in sports medicine, performance coaching andTable 6 continued Authors Type Purpose N (male:female)Sport; countryMain ndings Pensgaard and Roberts [84]Mixed role of coach7 (5:2) Skiing; NorwayAll athletes rated very highly on task orientation, and in the moderate to high range on ego orientation. Most athletes perceived a high mastery climate and a low performanceclimate.

Nearly20 % of participants acknowledged clinically relevant levels of traumatic stress at 3 and 8 months post-termination1348 S. M. Rice et al. 123elite athlete nutrition. As comparatively little progress has been made in the area of mental health, there is enormous scope for programmes to boost athlete wellbeing, which would likely flow on to benets in competitive perfor-mance and increase the likelihood of a successful transition to retirement [ 24,26,49,90]. Although vulnerability to mental ill-health might well be relatively comparable inelite athletes relative to the general community, there is signicant scope for coaches, team psychologists and sport administrators to focus on targeted screening and early detection, monitoring and intervention\u2014especially at key risk periods, such as signicant injury [ 91,92], transition to retirement [ 44,93] and following performance difculties [45]. Specic mental health help-seeking interventions are being developed for collegiate-level athletes, with a ran-domised, controlled trial currently underway [ 94]. The results of this work are likely to be relevant to elite-level athletes. Encouraging progress has been made in thedevelopment of mental health guidelines for working with school-aged athletes [ 95] and collegiate-level athletes [ 96- 98]. These guidelines show a growing emphasis on the need to provide specic and targeted support for the mental health needs of athletes. Th ey highlight the importanceof monitoring changes in specic observable behaviours, appreciating psychological history and the need for a responsive crisis interven tion framework specic to athletes. Development of comprehensive, targeted, dis-order-specic treatment models are a required next step, and the National Athletic Trainers' Association state- ment on preventing, detecting and managing disorderedeating provides a useful disorder-specic model [ 99]. Psychoeducation should also extend to substance use\u2014 in particular, alcohol\u2014given the tendency for hazardous use (bingeing) outside competition periods [ 100]a n dt h e stigma related to athlete help seeking in this domain[61]. Development of specic models of psychiatric inter- vention for elite athletes with signicant psychopathologyand impairment appears to be warranted [ 3,101]. Such models should capitalise on an early-intervention frame- work [ 102-104], ensuring early detection and prompt access to high-quality, evidence-based interventions. This may include implementing mental health screening pro- grammes alongside physical health checks [ 25], in addition to dissemination of mental health awareness support to key support people, including partners, friends, family,Table 7 Summary of other mental health and wellbeing studies in elite athletes Authors Type Purpose N(male:female) Sport, countryMain ndings Help seeking Gulliver et al.

Need dissatisfaction assessed independently from need satisfactionmay act to influence the wellbeing/stress pattern RCT randomised, controlled trialMental Health of Elite Athletes 1349 123coaching staff and administrative staff. For this to occur, collaborative efforts would be required between sports medicine practitioners, psychiatrists, psychologists and other mental health professionals [ 105], mindful of over- coming treatment barriers and stigma for athletes at the elite level and balancing the need for treatment with the need for ongoing performance in, or commitment to, theirchosen career [ 106]. In addition, from a broader public health perspective, better engagement of elite athletes in the domains of pos- itive mental health (and as identiable role models or ambassadors) may be signicant in mental health stigmareduction and in boosting help-seeking behaviours and engagement in services. Importantly, the mental health of hard-to-engage populations, such as young men [ 107] and older men [ 108,109], could be targeted. For this, the research will need to expand from simple cross-sectional designs and develop innovative strategies to improve ath-lete help seeking. Technology heralds a unique opportunity for this, especially given that the next generation of elite athletes will be digital natives and highly adept at utilisingcomputer-based or internet-based interventions. Finally, given the paucity of high-quality studies reported to date, we encourage sporting bodies to consider public dissemi-nation of any research (subject to ethical conduct) that is being conducted within the eld of elite athlete mental health. Such efforts will enable the eld to prosper anddevelop. 5 Conclusion Elite athletes experience a unique range of stressors thatmay potentially increase their vulnerability to mental ill- health. Key factors include the psychological impacts of injury, overtraining and burnout; intense public and mediascrutiny; and managing ongoing competitive pressures to perform. For the assessment and management of the mental health needs of elite athletes' to be on a par with theirphysical needs, more high-quality epidemiological and intervention studies are needed. Ideally, where possible and appropriate, the results of these should be disseminatedbeyond the organisation or sporting code.
