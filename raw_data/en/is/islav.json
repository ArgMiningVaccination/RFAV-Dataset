These two questions were merged into one project as most of the preparatory work was common to both pieces of research. However, findings are reported separately so as to provide a coh esive response to each individual question. Background The current meat inspection (MI) system for cattle, sheep and pigs in Europe was established at the end of the 19th century with the aim to protect consumers from diseases such as tuberculosis, brucellosis and human teaniasis acquired from animals. This MI system consists of checking animals and their organs for lesions and abnormalities , which is done visually , through palpation or incision as required. Post-mortem inspection relies solely on the detection of macroscopic lesions (visible to the naked eye) caused by pathogens or other hazards in the carcase and organs of affected animals. After targeted effort, inc luding surveillance and eradication programmes, many of these diseases have either been eradicated in Europe, or their prevalence has been greatly reduced, decreasing their significance to public and animal health. MI requirements are set out in directly applicable EC regulations . The current MI system allows for limited flexibility and does not follow risk assessment principles. This is a costly system that requires a great deal of public resources dedicated to carcase inspection. Rationale and Objectiv es Today , the most important meatborne hazards causing human disease are Campylobacter, Salmonella, Yersinia and E. coli. These do not typically cause clinical disease nor are they visible to the naked eye, and are therefore unlikely to be effectively detected by traditional MI tasks. They are usually transmitted to the carcase through faecal or other contamination routes during the slaug hter process . In this context, the MI system as a whole, or some MI tasks in particular, may no longer be fit for purpose . Thus, MI should be reviewed and more effective ways of addressing the new threats to human health should be considered . In addition to that, consideration should be given to the potential contributi on of MI tasks to cross -contamination of carcases. Notwithstanding this, many important hazards and conditions associated with animal health (including endemic and exotic infectious diseases) and animal welfare can be detected at the slaughterhouse. This adds complexity to the study of the contribution of each MI task to protecting animals and humans. Eliminati on of MI tasks that do not contribute meaningful ly to the detection of hazards could potentially free resources that could be used elsewhere to control meatborne diseases. However , this might result in an increased risk to humans and animals from pathogens currently being controlled. In order to evaluate the contribution of MI to public health, animal health and welfare, an assessment of the effectiveness of all M I tasks in relation to the most important hazards must be carried out . Approach Work has been carried out in three stages : 1) Identification of relevant hazards The most important public health (PH), animal health (AH) and animal welfare (AW) hazards associated with red meat production (cattle, sheep and pigs ) were identified using available scientific literature and published reports. Legally required MI tasks ( both ante-mortem, AM and post -mortem, PM) for these three species were mapped and their potential to detect the identified hazards was evaluated. 2) Development of a tool to evaluate the effectiveness of the MI system This step addresses the first policy qu estion. A tool was developed for the qualitative assessment of the detection capacity of each MI task. The assessment of effectiveness is mainly based on two parameters: the Sensitivity (Se) and the Positive Predictive Value (PPV). Sensitivity is defined as the proportion of positive (i.e. infected) carcases that are identified as positive by the MI task . PPV is the proportion of carcases identified as positive that are actually positive. The combination of these two parameters provides a general estimate of the capacity of a task to effectively detect a hazard. For this model, l iterature, available databases and expert opinion were used to obtain Se and PPV estimates for each task . These were then transformed in to qualitative estimates ( very low , low, medi um, high and very high ), and combined to produce an overall qualitative score which define d the tasks \"capacity of detection\" of a hazard. The qualitative assessment tool was applied to a selection of hazards with the purpose of validating the model. The hazards included were: Public health - Salmonella in pigs and T oxoplasmosis in sheep; Animal health - M. bovis (bTB), M. avium subsp paratuberculosis (MAP) in cattle and Classical S wine Fever in pigs; Animal welfare - Tail Biting and Hernia in pigs. 3) Risk assessment of green offal inspection This step relates to the second policy question. An assessment of the risk to animals and humans from changes in MI practices , specifically in green offal inspection, was carried out for the abovementioned selectio n of hazards, using t he Codex Alimentarius risk assessment framework. A risk pathway mapping all the steps of red meat production from lairage to chilling of the carcase was developed. T hree main factors were considered for each step : presence of a hazard, detection of the hazard and actions undertaken as a result of detecting the hazard . Current MI requirements dictate that green offal (including intestines and associated lymph nodes) must undergo visual inspection and palpation. For t his risk assessment PH, AH and AW risks associated with three scenarios have been studied : (i) current GO inspection regime; (ii) only visual inspection; and (iii) total absence of GO inspection. The assessment aimed to produce a measure of the likelihood of a hazard to be present in a carcase at chilling and to establish risk differences between the scenarios. Data and supporting information necessary for this research were obtained from official databases , official reports and scientific literature. Expert opinion was use d to address i nformation and data gaps. Conclusions Effectiveness Assessment Tool The results of the initial validation of the tool were satisfactory. It showed a good discrimination capacity that allows for appropriate comparison of effectiveness among MI tasks. However, further validation would confirm the suitability of the model for a greater number of hazards . The results so far are promising and fur ther work should be encouraged. The assessment findings suggest that only 20 out of the 33 legally required MI tasks may be contributing realistically to the detection of the hazards tested in this project. The outcomes on the selected hazards were in line with the experts expectations and experience. A great constraint on the work was the lack of data and information to include in the model . It will require a substantial amount of field -based research to obtain precise data. Risk Assessment The qualitat ive risk assessment for the three GO inspection scenarios showed that for the hazards studied in this research - bTB, toxoplasmosis (in sheep), MAP, Salmonella (in pigs), CSF, hernia and tail bites (in pigs) - the contribution of GO inspection was found to be of limited value because lesions associated with these hazards are seldom manifested in GO alone or their detection is not always followed by remedial action . Therefore, r emoval of this MI task would not make a substantial difference to the de tection of these hazards and to their consequent risks to PH , AH and AW. Understanding the results The findings of this research highlight the correlation between pathogens , animal health and welfare, meat production and safety of food products. These relationships must be considered in order to understand: o which MI tasks have a significant impact on the protection of public health, animal health and welfare. o which MI tasks have a significant impact on the presence of hazards. o whether the slaughterhous e is the best place to control certain PH, AH and AW risks. The outputs of the project will help to assess the value of the current MI process and to identify areas where improvements can be made to increas e effectiveness while e nsuring an appropriate level of public health, animal health and welfare protection. Section 3 : Achievements of Project Targets SCIENTIFIC OBJECTIVES (from Scope of Work section SW1): Objective 01 Create an inventory of hazards to human health, animal health and animal welfare related to meat production and its related conditions. Identify available meat inspection tasks at the slaughterhouse (including ante and post -mortem) for each of them. Extensive literature review was conducted to identify all hazards (public health, animal health and welfare) associated with meat production in the UK. Inspection data from FSA were also consulted. Meat inspection practices at the slaughterhouse (as described in the relevant European legislation) were mapped as well as their suitability to identify a selection of hazards (the most relevant hazards). The focus of this review was on biological hazards; however, a narrative review of chemical and physical hazards associated with meat production was also carried out and it is included in the report. Objective 02 Development of a qualitative approach to assess the relative effectiveness of inspection activities. This will produce a scientifically valid assessment tool to evaluate effectiveness of the various available meat inspection activities. A computer based model has been developed that maps the meat inspection practices at the slaughterhouse (ante and post -mortem). The model produces, by analysing numerical inputs (sensitivity and positive predictive value), a qualitative score that indicates the inspection tasks capacity of detection of a specific hazard. It can be applied to public health, animal health and animal welfare hazards. For each hazard, the qualitative scores of the different tasks are comparable; the outcome can be therefore understood as a \"relative capacity of detection\". Objective 03 Evaluate the suitability of each inspection task for a selection of hazards (for human health, animal health and animal welfare). The model has been applied to 7 hazards (3 for public health, 2 for animal health and 2 for animal welfare). The model has been evaluated by different external experts involved in the project and modified accordingly. Although initial validation has been achieved, the validation should be expanded to include other hazards to make sure the model responds appropriately to a great range of situations. A report on the activities undert aken as part of this objective along with an electronic version of the model accompanies the final report. Objective 04 Create a generic risk assessment model mapping all inspection tasks at the slaughterhouse. Please refer to report N3 for information o n the risk pathway assessment. Objective 05 Qualitatively evaluate the level of risk for specific hazards associated with the current and alternative green offal inspection activities. Two modifications to the original proposal have been introduced. T he pathway developed under objective 4 was simplified in order to be used for objective 5. Specifically, for objective 5 we focused on activities that take place at the slaughterhouse (i.e. we did not evaluate risks at the farm or during transport). Secon dly, the original proposal stated (objective 05. Task 02): \"... the evaluation of the risk is understood in this project as the probability of detecting the condition associated with a specific hazard (...) and the consequences for public health, animal h ealth and animal welfare.\" Our risk assessment evaluates the likelihood of a specific hazard being present at the end of the slaughter line (e.g. chiller). Instead of accurate measurement of consequences, we have made a general comment of what implication s will the presence of hazards in/on the carcase in the chilling room have for public health, animal health and animal welfare. This has been done assuming that all subsequent steps will not impact in the level of contamination of the carcase/meat.

Identify available meat ins pection tasks at the slaughterhouse for each of them. SCOPE OF STUDY This report outlines the activities conducted and r esults obtained as part of the first objective of the project MC1003. The scope of this first objective was to create an inventory of hazards to public health (PH), animal health (AH) and animal welfare (AW) related to meat production and to assess the e xtent to which the current meat inspection tasks at the slaughterhouse address thos e hazards. The project focus is on red meat production, and specifically cattle, pig a nd small ruminants. BACKGROUND Meat inspection (MI), comprising ante- and post-mor tem inspection, represents a fundamental control point for the various hazards a ssociated with the meat production chain. It was established in the ninetee nth century, when it was discovered that some serious human diseases origina ted in food animals and could be transmitted to humans through the consumption of meat (Edwards, Johnston et al. 1997). The aim of such inspection was to preven t transmission of infectious agents from animals to humans by detecting sick animals or infected carcases and preventing them from reaching the consumer. The und erlying principle was that animal diseases presented with macroscopic lesions in specific organs of the animal and those were easily identifiable during carcase i nspection (Pointon, Hamilton et al. 2000). Identification of such lesions was followed by appropriate measures to stop Project MC1003 2010 3 Outcomes and values of current ante- and post-morte m meat inspection tasks - Report 1 those animals or parts of the animals to get to the subsequent steps in the food chain (Edwards, Johnston et al. 1997). Meat inspection pr actices have not changed much since its inception and still rely heavily on the d etection of macroscopic signs and lesions in organs and carcases (Reg. (EC) 854/2004) . In addition, it appears to be a rigid and very prescriptive inspection (Gracey, Col lins et al. 1999). It has been transposed and use in areas and countries of great geographical distance, where farming methods and animal diseases were very diffe rent to those in Europe (Hathaway 1993). Later, meat inspection practices started playing an increasingly important role in protection of animal health and welfare. Inspection at the slaughterhouse is one of the most suitable points along the food chain to co llect a variety of data that can be used not only for early identification of epidemics or emerging diseases but also to guide the formulation of future policies regarding animal health on the national herd (Gracey, Collins et al. 1999; Garcia, Gonzalez et a l. 2003). Nevertheless, the primary role of MI is still nowadays the protection of publ ic health. It is well recognized that the traditional meat ins pection has accomplished a very important role in protecting the public from meatbo rne zoonoses. Many diseases that not very long ago were ravaging human health have n ow reduced their incidences, and in some cases virtually disappeared from the ma in part of the European continent (Edwards, Johnston et al. 1997). Illnesse s that were affecting big parts of the human population are now been seen only sporadicall y and are many times imported from other countries. This is especially c ommon with parasitic diseases that are connected to unsanitary conditions in the human population and low meat inspection standards (Sciutto, Fragoso et al. 2000; Garcia, Gonzalez et al. 2003). Although meat inspection at the point of slaughter was only one part of a broader process, it is well accepted that it represents an important one (Garcia, Gonzalez et al. 2003). Despite the success of MI to contain major human he alth hazards, today new threats seem to have become more prevalent. These n ew hazards, helped by the modern, industrialised way of food processing and d istribution, and the increased mobility across the globe of a big part of the huma n population, can reach a greater number of people and have very serious consequences . Examples are spongiform encephalopathy agents, campylobacter, drugs residue s and chemical contaminants. While some of these hazards may cause clinical dise ase on the animal host, many exist subclinically. As a result it is currently q uestioned to what extent the traditional inspection practices are suitable to deal with thes e hazards (Pointon, Hamilton et al. 2000). Even more, experts have suggested that tradi tional meat inspection may contribute to the spread of these agents (Edwards, Johnston et al. 1997; Pointon, Hamilton et al. 2000). Project MC1003 2010 4 Outcomes and values of current ante- and post-morte m meat inspection tasks - Report 1 Policy makers and stakeholders suggest the traditio nal meat inspection system at the slaughterhouse is not fit anymore to protect th e public against these diseases and a radical overhaul and a new way of thinking is nec essary (Edwards, Johnston et al. 1997; Mousing, Kyrval et al. 1997; Gracey, Collins et al. 1999; Pointon, Hamilton et al. 2000). The argument is based on the fact that, the diseases identifiable in traditional MI rarely present a risk for the consumer. The real risk currently lies with the invisible hazards(Mousing, Kyrval et al. 1997). In order to evaluate the suitability of the current meat inspection practices to protect public and animal health and animal welfare , risk assessment principles should be applied in the identification and assessm ent of hazards, to make the most effective use of limited existing resources (Pointo n, Hamilton et al. 2000). A holistic, or \"farm to fork\", approach should be taken, that w ill focus on the most critical steps in the identification of hazards from the farm till the final product (Desmarchelier, Higgs et al. 1999). The first part of this project, outlined in this fi rst report, examines the extent to which the most common meatborne hazards are suitable of b eing identified via the traditional MI practices as outlined in Regulation (EC) 854/2004. The evaluation includes public health, animal health and animal we lfare hazards. A comprehensive list of hazards is created, followed by a process o f selection of those particularly relevant to the meat production. In a second step, the tasks that a meat inspector is legally required to carry out at the slaughterhouse are listed and then matched to each of the hazards they are suitable to identify. TYPES OF HAZARDS The project looked at biological, chemical and phys ical hazards. Nevertheless, on the bases of (a) the actual relevance for either animal and public health and animal welfare and (b) the capacity of current meat inspec tion tasks, based primarily in visual inspection, palpation and incision, to ident ify each of these types of hazards, the research work presented in this report focuses primarily in biological hazards. Some considerations in relation to physical and che mical hazards are provided in the discussion session of this report. Project MC1003 2010 5 Outcomes and values of current ante- and post-morte m meat inspection tasks - Report 1 MATERIALS AND METHOD Task 1. Inventory of hazards to public health (PH), animal health (AH) and animal welfare (AW) related to meat production For the scope of this first objective a comprehensi ve list of hazards associated with meat production was compiled. Specifically, our rev iew consisted in two parts: (i) identification of hazards related to food productio n/consumption; (ii) selection of hazards relevant to the scope of our project. In th e context of this project, hazards means any physical, chemical or biological agent that may cause any type of public health, animal health and animal welfare risk . The review focuses in the UK and whenever relevant, in the EU. This first task is divided in the following two ste ps: Step 1.1. Comprehensive list of hazards (PH) - As a point of departure, a comprehensive list of public health hazards was created by collating information on all types o f public health hazards (ever) associated with consumption of food. The lis t includes all those hazards that were reported in literature as being related t o food consumption (including vegetables and waterborne hazards). Thre e main sources of information were used to collect information about foodborne related hazards: (i) the scientific literature, (ii) reports from of ficial organizations (FSA, EFSA, OIE, DEFRA, HPA), and (iii) data from these and oth er relevant organizations. A comprehensive table was created collating informa tion from all the sources above. The table includes information for each iden tified hazard such as name of pathogen, host animal species, degree of its ass ociation to foodborne poisoning, food vehicles, incidence in humans, feat ures of the clinical presentation, degree of its association to red meat , prevalence of the hazard in live animals and prevalence in carcase meat, among others. (AH) - The list of Notifiable Animal Diseases as publis hed by the OIE (http://www.oie.int/eng/maladies/en_classification20 10.htm ) was used as the reference list for Animal Health hazards. This is u nderstood as the most comprehensive list of hazards of interest to Great Britain. The diseases relevant to cattle, small ruminant and/or pigs were extracted from the list. Project MC1003 2010 6 Outcomes and values of current ante- and post-morte m meat inspection tasks - Report 1 (AW) - Information was obtained via expert elicitation. An initial list of potential animal welfare hazards 1 for each of the target species was created by initial consultation with 3 veterinarians with expe rtise in animal welfare. Subsequently a questionnaire was created and distri buted online among Official Veterinarians and Meat Inspectors to colle ct their views on the frequency and importance of each of the listed AW h azards (see annex 1). Participants in the survey were asked to rate (1 to 5, from low to high ) each AW hazard according to the frequency of observation in their abattoirs. Secondly, the survey required the participants to rate (1 to 4, irrelevant to extremely important ) each AW condition according to the perceived impo rtance/severity in the individual animal and on an average affected animal (i.e. not the extreme cases). Baseline information about the part icipants and their plants was also collected. Step 1.2. Selection of hazards relevant to the scop e of our project (PH) - A decision tree is used to create a scrutinized list that includes the most relevant hazards to meat production from those iden tified in step 1. See Annex 2 for an outline of the selection tree. Infor mation to inform the inclusion/exclusion process is obtained from variou s sources, including scientific literature and official reports from var ious relevant organizations. (AH) - A selection tree was produced to scrutinize the comprehensive list and focus the subsequent work in those hazards that are more relevant to the current situation in Great Britain. The selection t ree is outline in Annex 3. The information to inform the inclusion/exclusion proce ss was obtained from official reports and published information in the w ebsites of ). (AW) - The outcomes from the survey were summarized. A score for frequency and score for relevance was obtained by p ulling all the rating given by all respondents to each AW hazard. Specifically the \"score\" corresponds to the median 2 of the values entered by the participants. The med ian scores for 1 In this project \"animal welfare hazards\" refers to \"animal welfare conditions\". For consistency throughout the report the first term will be used. 2 The value that separates the higher half of the sc ores from the lower half Project MC1003 2010 7 Outcomes and values of current ante- and post-morte m meat inspection tasks - Report 1 severity and frequency were cross-tabulated in orde r to map the relative importance (frequency*severity) of each AW hazard. Hazards were selected according to this relative importance; very frequen t hazards (score 4-5) were selected, regardless of their relevance for AW. Ver y severe hazards (score 4) were selected regardless of their frequency. Task 2. Identification of conditions/lesions relate d to each hazard The clinical picture associated with each selected hazard was described. Information was collected from the scientific literature. Data derived from meat inspection in Great Britain was used to get an understanding of t he common features found in slaughterhouses over the last years. Although this list is not meant to be a precise reflection of the frequency with which each lesion is found, it was used as a proxy for the likelihood of each lesion to be identified at s laughter. Task 2 applies only for AH and PH hazards as, in th e context of this project, AW hazards are lesions/conditions per se. Task 3. Identification of meat inspection practices pairing to hazards The list of the current meat inspection practices i s obtained from the relevant legislation, namely Reg. (EC) 854/2004. For each of the hazards created under task 1 (step 1.2) we created a list of inspection practice s that have the potential to be detected current inspection practices. Information from three main sources was used to undertake this task: scientific literature, offi cial reports and the outcomes from meat inspection in the UK in the past years (source : FSA) The following report of results is divided into thr ee sections: Section A: public health hazards (PH) Section B: animal health hazards (AH) Section C: animal welfare hazards (AW). Project MC1003 2010 8 Outcomes and values of current ante- and post-morte m meat inspection tasks - Report 1 RESULTS Section A: public health hazards (PH) Task 1. Comprehensive list of foodborne hazards A comprehensive list of foodborne hazards was creat ed. A total of 46 foodborne biological hazards were identified, including bacte ria, virus and parasites (table 1). Multiple sources of information were consulted. Rel evant information to undertake this task was obtained from a variety of sources (s ee bibliography). Literature was scarce and in some cases contrasting. The list incl udes few hazards (viruses) which are not known to be zoonotic; but most of the ident ified hazards have at least one species of animals as reservoir. We adopted a conse rvative approach so as to create the broadest possible view of public health hazards . The information available for each hazard was also very variable. A summary of th e information collected is available as an electronic file ( hazards comprehensive list.xls ). The comprehensive list of hazards was subsequently revised to produce a more concise list including public health hazards of interest to our project. We produ ced a list of sixteen (16) meatborne biological hazards that can be considered the ones of major significance to the GB context (highlighted in table 1) (annex 4). Task 2. Identification of lesions associated with e ach hazard For each hazard a list of possible clinical conditi ons was compiled. The literature, grey and scientific, was consulted to ensure the br oadest range of conditions is captured. For reference, data obtained from the Foo d Standards Agency relative to outcomes of the meat inspection practices in Great Britain was used to get an appreciation of the extent to which those condition s are presented at the slaughterhouse. This data was not considered to be of high accuracy, as it was not possible to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the inspection and the reporting system. For these reasons the data were used only t o confirm the findings from the literature. A complete list of hazards with its ass ociated clinical presentation and inspection findings is provided in Annex 5. Project MC1003 2010 9 Outcomes and values of current ante- and post-morte m meat inspection tasks - Report 1 Task 3. Pairing inspection practices and hazards The list of meat inspection practices as specified in EC legislation was compiled. Inspection practices are divided in Reg. (EC) 854/2 004 in obligatory (i.e. to be undertaken for each slaughtered animal) and optiona l (i.e. at the discretion of the Official Veterinarian). Only obligatory inspection practices were considered in our study as this are the only tasks expected to be con ducted systematically at slaughter. Each selected hazard and the lesions that are poten tially visible at slaughter were paired against each inspection practice. This was d one for the three species under study (cattle, sheep and pigs). Given the size of t he document, details are provided in an electronic file ( hazards-meat inspection tasks.xls ). Table 1.

Project MC1003 2010 10 Outcomes and values of current ante- and post-morte m meat inspection tasks - Report 1 Section B: animal health hazards (AH) Task 1. Comprehensive list of animal health hazards A total of forty-four (44) diseases were identified for cattle, small ruminants and pigs from the list of notifiable diseases published by t he OIE. The list of identified \"hazards\" is provided in table 2. A decision tree w as created to narrow down the list to include those particularly relevant to the aims of this project. Inclusion/exclusion criteria include: i. Included in the list of Notifiable diseases in GB. ii. Reported in the country in the last 10 year (2000-2 010) The inclusion/exclusion process (annex 3) was follo wed. This produced a final total of nine (9) diseases (highlighted in table 2). Task 2. Lesions associated with each hazard The clinical presentation and the potential lesions suitable to be identified during slaughter were collected for each of the identified AH hazards. We excluded those pathogens (n=3) that had been covered in Section A (public health hazards), as the information had already been collected. The literat ure, grey and scientific, was consulted to ensure the broadest range of condition s was captured. For reference, data obtained from the Food Standards Agency relati ve to outcomes of the meat inspection practices in Great Britain was used to g et an appreciation of the extent to which those conditions are presented at the slaught erhouse. A complete list of hazards with its associated clinical presentation a nd inspection findings is provided in Annex 6. Task 3. Pairing inspection practices and hazards The list of meat inspection practices outlined in R eg. (EC) 854/2004 was matched to the lesions associated with each animal health haza rd. Only obligatory inspection practices were considered. Each selected hazard and the lesions that are potentially visible at slaughter were paired against each inspe ction practice. This was done for Project MC1003 2010 11 Outcomes and values of current ante- and post-morte m meat inspection tasks - Report 1 the three species under study (cattle, sheep and pi gs).

Project MC1003 2010 12 Outcomes and values of current ante- and post-morte m meat inspection tasks - Report 1 Section B: animal welfare hazards (AW ) Task 1. Comprehensive list of AW hazards An initial meeting with experts produced a list of 13 AW conditions in cattle, 18 AW conditions in small ruminants and 8 AW conditions i n pigs (table 3). This list of conditions for the various animal species formed th e basis for the \"expert survey\". The survey was circulated among a restricted number of lead veterinarians with instructions to circulate among OV and MI in their respective clusters. It is not possible to know the total number of veterinarians who received the online questionnaire, as it is likely the email was furthe r circulated among OVs and MIs upon reception. At 17 October 2010 3, the survey had 101 responses which were used for our project. Nine (9) responses were not valid as the questionnaire had not been completed. The participation was considered good. Most of the participants were either OV (62) or MI (22). The remaining 8 participants fell out o f these categories, and included lead veterinarians, technical staff and academics w orking in the area of veterinary public health. The number of years of experience in the meat industry was very variable, ranging from 2 years to 49 years (median = 7). The experience across species was variable. Eighty two (82) respondents worked in cattle plants, eighty-one (81) in small ruminants and sixty-four (64) in pig plants. The survey did not contribute to expanding the list of initially identified AW hazar ds as few respondents added extra conditions. Participants ranked each condition (see materials a nd methods) according to frequency and severity. Almost all conditions were retained by participants to be of medium to high animal welfare importance. The frequ ency of presentation of those conditions at slaughter was varied, covering very r are to very common conditions (see table 4). As a result, cross-tabulation left o nly few hazards out of our range of interest. The selected AW hazards are presented in table 5. 3 At the time of finalising this report (29 October 2010) the online survey had reached approx. 118 responses.

The project has aimed at provid ing a comprehensive revision of hazards, followed by more in depth investigation of selected ones that are likely to be more relevant for this country (in terms of actual burden of either human health, animal health and animal welfare). The project has combined a range of methods to reac h a broad spectrum of information sources. The scientific literature on t his topic has been found to be lacking to a great extent or, in many cases, outdat ed. This report therefore summarizes the best available evidence to date. Whe never published sources of information were totally lacking, expert consultati on has been undertaken. This is suggested as the most reliable source in the absenc e of more formal sources. In the context of this project, this source has been key t o ensure completion of the activities planned for this first objective. In the tables provided as part of this report ( ...hazards-meat inspection practices.xls ) it is possible to visualize which are the inspection prac tices that are suited to identify specific hazards. It can be seen that, for some of the hazards (e.g. gastrointestinal microorganisms) the current meat inspection practic es only allow to detect specific forms of the disease. These clinical signs are thou gh not present in all infected animals, what reduces the absolute efficacy of the practice to detect that hazard. It has to be noted that the results of this first obje ctive aim at giving a general overview of the degree to which current practices match the clinical presentations of the most important hazards. This report therefore does not p rovide an evaluation of the \"real value\" of specific inspection practices to protect public health, animal health and/or animal welfare, as this will depend, among others, on the frequency with which specific clinical signs appear in association with specific hazards. By the results of our lesions-inspection tasks pair ing exercise, it seems that all inspection practices effectively target at least on e hazard. In most cases they are Project MC1003 2010 17 Outcomes and values of current ante- and post-morte m meat inspection tasks - Report 1 suited to identify more than one hazard, but this s eems again to depend on the frequency of appearance of clinical signs in infect ed animals. Nevertheless, the exercise highlighted a few inspection tasks for whi ch there were no grounds to believe they were suited to identify any of the con sidered hazard. For example, when looking at the most relevant public health hazards, the following inspection tasks did not seem to be able to target any: AM inspection; p leura, peritoneum haryngeal LNs, submaxillary LNs and parotid LNs. Ultimately this seems to be co nditioned by the extent to which that hazard will present with the expected clinical signs. However, some of the above outlined inspection task s, especially AM inspection and inspection of the head, showed to be very important in the identification of animal health hazards, as well as almost all animal welfar e hazards. Not surprisingly, AM inspection seem to be the only task able to ensure appropriate identification of a greater range of AW conditions. For some of those c onditions, AM inspection is the only suitable meat inspection practice. The first objective of project MC1003, presented in this report, aimed at providing a easy to read and general assessment of the matching between specific hazards and official inspection practices. The information used to inform the process for this objective is relative to the current situation in G B. Although it is likely that most of the reported findings will apply similarly to other EU Member States, this cannot be assumed without appropriate evaluation. Finally, the authors of this report would like to e mphasize that the findings of this report do not represent an accurate assessment of t he level of public health, animal health and animal welfare protection provided by th e current meat inspection tasks. To make such an evaluation, a formal socio-economic analysis should be undertaken covering the potential economic impact to industry, society and other stakeholders; an assessment on public and animal protection from food derived risks and consumer attitudes towards a different meat inspect ion system. Project MC1003 2010 18 Outcomes and values of current ante- and post-morte m meat inspection tasks - Report 1 Considerations on physical and chemical hazards Physical hazards After reviewing the literature on meatborne hazards , and taking into account the number of articles dedicated to each category of ha zards (biological, chemical and physical) the conclusion is drawn that the risk of physical hazards related to the meat production is relatively less relevant for AH, AW a nd PH. Moreover, physical hazards relate only to public health - We could not find any meatborne physical hazard of importance for AH or AW. The existing literature on physical hazards is very limited. The only two physical hazards identified through literature that can orig inate in animals are (i) broken needles, or fragments of needles, that are used for veterinary purposes (vaccinations and injections of medicinal or similar products) an d (ii) fragments of bullets, pellets or similar projectiles that are used for hunting (H orchner, 2006). In the context of meat inspection of farmed animals, the broken or fr agmented needles play the most important role, although it has been reported that projectiles, probably more often airgun pellets, can be found in the bodies of anima ls due to malicious acts of people (Stier 2003). On the other hand, the presence of le ad shots, bullets etc. in the carcases of hunted game should be considered as normal and, accordingly, these findings should be expected in animals killed by shooting. Broken or fragmented needles embedded in the tissue s of the animals can cause a variety of reactions in the body, mainly in the mus cles. These reactions are usually of an inflammatory nature, probably due to the presenc e of bacteria on the needle or of the nature of the injected substance itself. The re actions are usually referred to as \"injection-site lesions\" and may be abscessation (H ouser 2004), scar tissue formation, callus formation or cyst formation (Beechinor, Buck ley et al. 2001). For example, the prevalence of injection-site lesions in particular muscles on beef carcases in the US ranged from 2% (Roeber, Cannell et al. 2001) to 10% (George, Morgan et al. 1995) to 20% (Beechinor, Buckley et al. 2001). Similarly, in Canada, in 1999, 0.2% of whole beef carcases were found with injection-site lesions (Va n Donkersgoed, Jewison et al. Project MC1003 2010 19 Outcomes and values of current ante- and post-morte m meat inspection tasks - Report 1 2001). In conclusion, these lesions are quite wides pread and common and they are well known to the farming and meat industry. Becaus e they result in economical loss to the industry, mainly due to the trimming require d and the subsequent weight loss of the carcass, and because they pose a potential p ublic health hazard, a considerable amount of research has been carried out and literat ure is available, especially from the United States, to address this issue and to fin d solutions to it. Suggested solutions have been needle-free injection devices (Chase, Dan iels et al. 2008), education of the farmers(Roeber, Cannell et al. 2001) and good farmi ng practices, whereby cases of broken needles are recorded and brought to the atte ntion of the abattoirs and inspection authorities (Maunsell 2004; Horchner, Br ett et al. 2006). In addition, research has been carried out on the reasons why ne edles break and how to reduce the incidence (Hoff and Sundberg 1999) Because of the lack of literature to indicate other wise, we consider the vast majority of the injection-site lesions to be just the reacti on of the body to the injection itself, rather than the breakage of the needle. This is als o supported by George et al, 1995, where during a histological examination of 15,464 i njection-site lesions on a beef muscle at boning room level, no broken needle or fr agment was mentioned. It is very difficult to quantify what proportion of injection- site lesions is caused by broken needles but, taking the previous study into account we have to assume that it is a very small proportion. This conclusion is supported by the fact that there are no reports available on findings of needles in carcase s during any kind of meat inspection on the line or, at a later stage, during metal foreign bodies' detection of cut meat in the boning room. In a study carried out by Edwards and Stringer on foreign matter contamination of food in the UK, 2,347 incid ents were reviewed (of which 200, or 8.8% meat or meat products) and needles did not appear at all in the list (Edwards 2007) The value of post-mortem meat inspection in the det ection of broken needles is questionable and debateable. Most authors consider the most important stage of preventing broken needles reaching the consumer to lay in the primary production. That means that the frequency of breakage has to be reduced, either by applying better injection techniques, by using better needle s, by preferring SC rather than IM injections (Hoff and Sundberg 1999), by the elimina tion of injections with needles altogether (Chase, Daniels et al. 2008) or by the p roper recording of broken needles and warning of the parties further down the chain. Visual PM inspection is considered by some authors as not adding any value (Horchner, Brett et al. 2006) Project MC1003 2010 20 Outcomes and values of current ante- and post-morte m meat inspection tasks - Report 1 while others believe it is a useful tool, and certa inly one part of the whole control process that should be in place for the detection o f broken needles. (Houser 2004) The authors of this study believe that PM MI has ce rtainly a role to play in the issue of broken needles in carcase meat. Despite that fac t that, under realistic inspection conditions (line speed, light levels etc.), it woul d be highly unlikely for a needle to be detected during visual inspection, we nevertheless believe that the lesions caused by the reaction of the body to the presence of a needl e are extremely visible and easily detectable. This opinion is supported by the high l evel of abscessation found in common injection/vaccination sites during PM MI, es pecially on older animals. These lesions are at the moment removed by the inspectors and, therefore, maybe one of the reasons why not more needles are found in the b oning rooms, or in the plates of the final consumer, is exactly this inspection poin t. Chemical hazards The fear of food contaminated with various chemical s that may cause serious disease to the consumer has always been widespread in the h uman population. At some points in time, especially after the Second World W ar, the fear of residues in the food ranked higher than that of microbiological contamin ation and disease. This may have to do with the fact that microbiological agents nor mally cause obvious and acute disease that, in addition, it is quite common among the population and every person has had or will have experience with this kind of d isease at least once in his lifetime. Chemical contaminants on the other hand elicit a di fferent kind of reaction. The conditions they cause to humans are usually long te rm and insidious (Sharpe and Livesey 2006). In addition, the perception is that they cause terrible conditions, ranging from cancer to sterility to teratogenicity and hormonal imbalances. The many food scandals that have occurred over time in the media have not helped to abate this perception (Larsson, Olsson et al. 2005) . Considering the numbers of bacterial food poisoning that affect the human popu lation and comparing them with the incidence of chemical hazards in the same popul ation, it seems hard to justify this fear. Chemical contaminants in food are a very wide group of substances. They range from substances that are normally in use in agricul ture, like veterinary medicines Project MC1003 2010 21 Outcomes and values of current ante- and post-morte m meat inspection tasks - Report 1 and feed additives, pesticides (a group of chemical s that includes insecticides, rodenticides and herbicides) and chemicals used in the maintenance of agricultural equipment and buildings (engine oils and fuels, woo d treatment preparations etc.) to substances that are not in use, or should not be us ed, in agriculture and are not normally expected to be found in agricultural produ cts, including meat (Waltnertoews and Mcewen 1994). The second category includes environmental contaminants, like heavy metals (although some of t hem are also in use in agricultural products, like arsenic in insecticides ) (Sharpe and Livesey 2006; Andree, Jira et al. 2010) and not licensed veterinary prepa rations (Reig and Toldra 2008), but also substances, and especially heavy metal, found normally in soil in some cases (Sharpe and Livesey 2006) Each one of these chemicals can find its way, by ac cident or deliberate, to the body of the farm animals and from there to the final consum er. Each one of them, depending on the amount and the period of ingestion, has the potential to cause disease to both, animals and consumers, and in this way may have an effect on animal health and welfare, and also public health. In addition, most of these substances have the capacity to bio-accumulate over time in the body of the animal, usually in the fat tissue, with the result that the final consumer, be ing on the top of the food chain, can receive in one go concentrations many times higher than the ones that the contaminated animal would receive (Andree, Jira et al. 2010) Because of the real risk these substances present t o (mainly) PH, and because of the perception of the public, the states have been forc ed to take action against these contaminants. With regard to red meat, It must have been fairly obvious to the legislators that the traditional MI system put in p lace in the abattoirs to deal mainly with biological hazards was inadequate to deal with the chemical contaminants and so other mechanisms and policies had to be put in p lace (Reig and Toldra 2008). Nevertheless the existing MI system plays an import ant role in the fight against chemical residues in meat and we will examine that role a bit later. In this report we present the threat that chemical hazards pose to, primarily, the public health and, secondarily, to animal health an d welfare. Because of the vast number of chemical groups, sub-groups and substance s and the time limitations of this project, this reports gives only a general ove rview of what these hazards are, where they are found and how they can enter the foo d chain, what mechanisms are Project MC1003 2010 22 Outcomes and values of current ante- and post-morte m meat inspection tasks - Report 1 right now in place to deal with them (on European l evel) and, finally, what the role of the current meat inspection system is in all thi s. It should be noted here that toxins produced by living organisms (plants, fungi etc.), although being able of entering the food chain through animals and causing disease in h umans, have been excluded from this study. The following pages provide a series of tables pres enting relevant factual information regarding chemical hazards (tables 6 and 7). Control of chemical hazards There are two main ways of protection of the public health against chemical hazards originating from meat. The first is when there is a n incident reported to the attention of VLA. This will trigger an investigation and if t he result of this investigation is positive, the state will ask the farmer affected to voluntarily resist of sending the contaminated animal(s) for slaughter, for a prescri bed period. If the owner of the animals will resist to this suggestion, the state c an enforce this through the Contaminants in Food (England) Regulations 2003. The second way of control against chemical hazards in the food chain (including to a great degree carcase meat) is through the regular m onitoring of a variety of foods, as prescribed in regulation (EEC) 2377/90. Through thi s regulation every member state is obliged to implement a residues monitoring progr am and relay the information back to the EU. Sampling is random and the substanc es to be tested are described in the annexes of the above regulation. Annex I and II I of that regulation include veterinary medicines that are allowed to be used in farm animals, which are tested against some limits (maximum residues limits, MRL). If a substance is found exceeding the MRL, this is considered a positive re sult. Annex IV includes substances that are not allowed for use in farm animals (pheny lbutazone, growth promoting hormones etc.) or are contaminants (heavy metals et c.) and, if found at any level, this is considered as a positive result as well. All pos itive results have to be investigated further to find, if possible, the reason of the pro blem. It is obvious that by the time the results of the s amples are back, the food in question will have been consumed already and so this method is only retroactive and preventive value Project MC1003 2010 23 Outcomes and values of current ante- and post-morte m meat inspection tasks - Report 1 Chemical Hazards and MI: Value of Meat Inspection As presented in annex 7, all chemical hazards can c ause obvious clinical disease and most of them show pathological lesions. However, hi s happens normally in high or very high exposure of the animals to the hazard, li ke during accidental ingestion of a substance by an animal or group of animals. Most o f the time the exposure is low level and/or chronic and may not cause obvious sign s. In addition, all of these signs and PM findings are very similar to those caused by other diseases or conditions and are therefore non-specific and not pathognomonic (R adostits and Done 2007). Taking also into account the extremely low incidence of po isoning cases in the UK (VLA 2008), it would be overoptimistic to expect a veter inarian or an inspector to suspect, let alone to diagnose, a chemical related condition in an animal. Nevertheless, in our opinion the meat inspection at the abattoir can add some value, based on the following points: Detain and sample suspect carcases (e.g. carcases w ith recent injection lesions etc.). Diseased and abscessed animals have a higher probability to have been treated with antibacterials and therefore test positive (\"targeted testing\"). (Waltnertoews and Mcewen 1994) Check for signs or beta-agonists admini stration (extremely lean carcases, carcases where the conformation does not match the age, gender etc.)(Reig and Toldra 2008) Check for signs of implants in suspect sites: It is known that where hormones and other preparations are used illegally, they are usually implanted in sites like the base of the ear. A case like this could ex hibit traces of the product (boluses etc.) or reactive tissue (e.g. abscess, gr anuloma)(Gracey, Collins et al. 1999) In all these cases the meat inspection could be a s tep in the whole chain of controls. Some literature suggests that despite the large amo unts of chemicals used in agriculture, the residue levels in all foods have d ecreased in the past decades (Waltnertoews and Mcewen 1994), (EFSA 2010). In add ition, the effects of these chemicals on the human body are in many cases not w ell understood, and it is Project MC1003 2010 24 Outcomes and values of current ante- and post-morte m meat inspection tasks - Report 1 possible that the degree of harm is overestimated. Nevertheless, it is widely accepted that most of the chemical hazards can, under the ri ght circumstances, have a detrimental effect on human health and therefore al l efforts to monitor them and keep them under control seem justified.

The specific objectives of the workshop were: 1. To discuss approaches to the evaluation of meat inspection practices (based on experiences from other countries, if available). 2. To exchange information on activities on this ar ea (revision of meat inspection controls, evaluation of alternative systems for mea t inspection,...) that have been or are being investigated in other countries (especial ly Europe). 3. To create the basis to develop a tool for effect iveness assessment of inspection tasks. 3 Royal Veterinary College, Hawkshead workshop was an opportunity to share experience s in relation to the revision of meat inspection controls in different European countries . It was also a platform to revise the work achieved so far in the project, and the future step s. This report outlines the main points of discussion. Summary of discussions /checkbld Presentation of general activities in the context o f review of meat inspection controls in the countries represented in the workshop. Participants presented recent advances, investigati ons and developments in terms of meat inspection control in their respective countries. DENMARK - the revision of the current meat inspecti on system has been driven mainly by industry (DAFC is a corporation owned by the farmer s that assists the Danish slaughterhouses in their work - the slaughterhouses are also owned by the farmers). In light of this and the specific type of pig production in the country (i.e. good traceability in general and concentration of slaughtering on a limited smal l number of slaughterhouses) stimulates the interest of the sector in reconsidering potenti al options for improved inspection and facilitates discussion and action. The current dise ase status of the country is essential in framing the context and makes a \"risk-based program me for meat inspection possible. It was highlighted that the revision of the meat inspectio n was also conditioned by the current trade situation in the country (large export to USA ). Main concerns in the revision of inspections are: (i) consumer reactions - of partic ular relevance when considering potential changes; (ii) notifiable diseases - this is particu larly relevant in relation to trade within EU and with third countries; (iii) animal health - cha nges in meat inspection should preferably be coupled with a veterinary service that constantl y increases focus on advisory service rather than treatments (iv) animal welfare. To date the revision of meat inspection is targetin g finisher pig production, and specifically \"integrated production systems\". This implies a spe cific set of requirements to biosecurity defined in Regulation 1244/2007 has to be met. GERMANY - Germany has become more self-sufficient i n pig meat production in recent years. The production systems are more diverse tha n in Denmark, with different slaughtering systems (small to large plants) across regions in the country. Moreover, the meat production industry is less influenced by expo rts. Mainly the big slaughterhouses are the ones advocating and driving changes to the meat inspection system, making use of the flexibility allowed for in the current legislation. At the moment, visual meat inspection is possible (if specific criteria are met by the plant ) for slaughtered pigs and calves. The country 4 Royal Veterinary College, Hawkshead Lane, also exploring novel diagnostic tools that could substitute some of the current inspection practices. UNITED KINGDOM - The current focus is the gathering of scientific evidence to support a revised inspection control system, including risk b ased inspection. The first step in a potentially revised system would be to move within the flexibility allowed for in the current legislation. It was emphasized that, in this countr y, industry is not the driving force in the revision of meat inspection, but the public sector. In this context, the Food Standards Agency is commi ssioning a number of research projects as part of specific requirements set by the Agency. /checkbld Presentation on project aims and update on progress and results The project aims and objectives were briefly presen ted, structured in three main parts: (i) hazard-inspection matching, (ii) effectiveness asse ssment tool and (iii) risk assessment framework. i. Hazard-risk mapping The results of the first report (Project report N.1 - public health hazards) were visited and discussed. The methodology used and the results obt ained to date were very welcome by the participants. There were no major comments o n the approach used. The approach envisaged for exploring Animal Health (AH) and Animal Welfare (AW) hazards was presented and discussed. Animal health - Hazards (diseases) are to be identified among no tifiable diseases; it was agreed that only those hazards for which a routine collection and use of data currently exist are the ones that may potentially be impacted by a revision of meat inspection. Members of the research team have been invited to a ttend an FSA-DEFRA-AHO meeting next November 12, where priorities for AH and AW wi ll be discussed. It was noted that the outcome of that meeting will not influence the direction of our work as our report on AH hazards is due before the meeting. The identi fication of AH hazard will focus on diseases (i.e. agent focus) rather than syndromes. Animal welfare - Due to very limited available literature relatin g to hazards on this topic, the assessment of hazards is to be done usin g expert opinion (online questionnaire). The idea was well received by the p articipants. The newly published \"EU quality welfare reports\" were suggested as another source of information for this specific part of the project, but it was recognised that some of the assessment criteria would be too lengthy and involved for the approach needed for the present application. It was concluded that guidance is needed from DEFRA through the FSA on what the 5 Royal Veterinary College, Hawkshead using PMI as a way of monitoring anima l welfare. More specifically, are the goals (i) limited to stock raised for slaughter or do they encompass breeding stock (ii) intended to encompass suffering associated with dis ease, and if not what should be included (iii) intended to ascribe culpability to p articular sectors (iv) to assist with constructing a surveillance system that could be us ed as a modifier in the single farm payment system or any other subsidy system for farm ers. ii. Effectiveness assessment tool This aspect was the principal focus of the workshop . Discussion on criteria to be included in the assessment of effectiveness of meat inspection tasks concluded the following: Two main criteria to be the basis of the effectiven ess assessment were identified: /head2right Sensitivity - \"proportion of actual positives that are identif ied as positives\" (e.g. the proportion of offal with a specific hazard that is identified as positive for that hazard) /head2right Positive predictive value , PPV (influenced by prevalence and related specifi city) - \"probability that a hazard identified as such is really that hazard\" (e.g. the proportion of offal that has a specific hazard amon g those that are \"diagnosed\" with it). Assumptions that will underlie the assessment of ef fectiveness: /head2right Knowledge/awareness of hazards (particularly releva nt in the case of emerging hazards): inspectors and official veterinarians nee d to be, at every moment, appropriately aware and have adequate knowledge to detect with 100% sensitivity and specificity a hazard. /head2right Layout of the plant (particular case of AW hazards) : the effectiveness tool will assume a specific scenario (that will reflect, wher e possible, the most common plant layout in the UK) and any outcomes of the ass essment tool will relate to this specific scenario. /head2right Time for inspection: Meat inspectors have enough ti me to appropriately inspect each viscera. This assumption is supported by the \" business agreement\" that requires plants to adjust the number of personnel e mployed according to the throughput. It is assumed that plants in the UK ope rate on this basis. Further comments: 6 Royal Veterinary College, Hawkshead should make clear that the outputs are b ased in, and relevant to, the UK. Effectiveness is understood in this project as: \"th e probability of a specific meat inspection task of detecting a specific hazard\" or, briefly, \"detection capacity \". The importance of defining who will be the end-user s of the assessment tool was raised as a question. Policy makers (FSA) will be the ulti mate users of this tool. It is meant to provide a solid/scientifically valid estimate of th e relative effectiveness of specific meat inspection tasks. Another aspect that may be releva nt in the evaluation of effectiveness would be \"costs\". It was agreed that, at this point in time, we should not consider this aspect, as the aim of the exercise is to produce evidence on relative \"detection capacity\" . Discussion arose regarding the availability of data to be used in the effectiveness assessment (Sensitivity and PPV). The sources of in fo will be scientific literature or, when not available, expert consultation. It may be necessary to include also as an assessmen t criteria \"the proportion of animals that present with that lesion\" or \"likelihood of a hazard to present with a lesion\". No agreement was obtained on this point, but it will b e considered while developing the tool. Potential outputs from the tool: Quantitative measures (low, medium, high) of effect iveness of an inspection task for a specific hazard. Identification of tasks that have low/high effectiv eness for all considered hazards. Evaluation of lesions (related to AW, AH, PH respec tively) and identification of the most effective tasks for assessing those lesions. It was clarified that the project will not evaluate systematically all identified hazards, but will only undertake a pilot assessment for a select ion of hazards to evaluate the usefulness and rigour of the tool. iii. Risk assessment framework The concept of the risk pathway for the assessment framework was presented and discussed. The following are the principal aspects raised during discussion: /head2right The risk pathway could contain the following three aspects: steps in production, characteristics of the hazard and control options. 7 Royal Veterinary College, Hawkshead Lane, tasks will be incorporated in the ri sk pathway, as part of the \"controls\". /head2right Identification of hazards to be \"risk assessed\" cou ld be done by focusing on hazards that can be detected during offal inspection (as this is the focus of FSA requirement). The risk assessment will though evaluate the risk from farm to chiller. /head2right The risk assessment will probably depend on the pop ulation we are looking at (i.e. young vs old animals; integrated vs not-integrated produc tion systems). The population the assessment refers to should be explicitly presented in the assessment report. Conclusions The workshop was beneficial to the progress of the project. It provided an opportunity to discuss plans and relevance of the work. While the activities in the context of this research project focus on production of sound evidence for d ecision making, it was emphasized during the workshop that any revision of meat inspe ction should be made after careful evaluation of the country-specific conditions, and after appropriate cost-effectiveness assessment of potential changes. This is likely to depend on the meat production system in the country and the driving forces for change. The team in this project strongly supports this view and remarked that the role of the specific wor k being done in the context of project MC1003 is to provide \"scientifically sound\" strateg ies for the evaluation of effectiveness of specific meat inspection tasks. These assessments c annot be used as the sole source of information for decision making. An evaluation of i mpact (at many levels) should be made before recommendations for a revised meat inspectio n system are made. 8 Royal Veterinary College, Hawkshead Workshop agenda (as circulated before the w orkshop) Review of meat inspection controls WORKSHOP RVC Camden Campus, Royal College Street, NW1 0TU, L ondon 12-13 October 2010 \"Development of a qualitative approach to assess the relative effectiveness 2 of the current meat inspection activities\" (project funded by the Food Standards Agency) Participants: Nikolaos Dadios (RVC) and Silvia Alo nso (RVC).

SCOPE OF STUDY This report outlines the activities conducted and r esults obtained as part of the forth objective of the project MC1003. Strategy and resul ts of objective 2 \"List of hazards, its associated conditions and suitable inspection t asks\" (delivered 31.10.10) and objective 3 \"Report of expert workshop\" (delivered 28.10.10) have been taken in account in this document. The scope of the objective topic of this report was to create a generic risk pathway of meat inspection by mapping inspection tasks at slau ghterhouse level, during transport and at primary production level. This gen eric model sets hazard level, controls and actions (see chapter 6.5) from farm to slaughterhouse in interaction. This shall allow a future evaluation of the impact of different control practices on the \"level\" of risk associated to hazards in the meat p roduction and will form the basis of objective 5 \"Evaluation of risk for public health a ssociated with the current green offal inspection activities\". The project focus is on red meat production, and sp ecifically cattle, pig and small ruminants. MC1003 - Report N.3 2010 3 Assessment of benefit to public and animal health o f post -mortem inspection of green offal in red meat species at slaughter - RISK PATHWAY BACKGROUND Since 1964, food hygiene has been incorporated in t he legislation of the European Union (EU); consumer protection, animal health and official controls were included in many legislative texts. A key policy priority of the European Commission (E C) is assuring that the EU has the highest standards of food safety. This priority is reflected in the White Paper on Food Safety which was published in 2000 (EC, 2000). The guiding principle throughout the White Paper is that food safety poli cy must be based on a comprehensive, integrated approach. This means thro ughout the food chain \"farm to table\" (EC, 2000). 1. Food chain approach - links in the food chain The European food safety legislation covers all asp ects of food products from \"farm to table\". It deals with the hygiene of food in a h orizontal way, including feed production, primary production, food processing, st orage, transport and retail sale. This integrated approach is necessary to ensure foo d safety from the place of primary production up to and including placing on the marke t or export ( Reg. (EC) 852/2004 ). Every food business operator along the food chain s hould ensure that food safety is not compromised as each element may have a potentia l impact on food safety (Reg. (EC) 178/2002 ). Directive (EC) 2160/2003 points out the need for co ntrols covering the whole food chain. Targets to reduce hazard level and consequen tially public health risk may be established in respect to other parts of the food c hain, where necessary. This approach to start with the control of food safety a t primary production level is already implemented for certain pathogens and produ ction types of animals, e.g. control of food-borne Salmonella in breeding hens, laying hens and broilers. A reduction target for slaughter and breeding pigs is currently in discussion (EU, 2009). 2. Responsibilities The scope of Regulation (EC) 852/2004 is to lay dow n \"general rules for food business operators on the h ygiene of foodstuffs, taking particular account of the following principles: MC1003 - Report N.3 2010 4 Assessment of benefit to public and animal health o f post -mortem inspection of green offal in red meat species at slaughter - RISK PATHWAY (a) primary responsibility for food safety rests wi th the food business operator; (b) it is necessary to ensure food safety throughou t the food chain, starting with primary production.\" This legislative text lays down minimum hygiene requirements and requirem ents for food business operators to establish and operate fo od safety programmes and procedures based on the HACCP principles. These mea sures focus on satisfaction the relevant hygiene requirements at all stages of prod uction, processing and distribution of food under their control, as laid d own in legislation (Reg. (EC) 852/2004 ). In parallel, the role of official controls is to ch eck food business operators' compliance with European legislation and its correct implement ation by the food business operator. Furthermore, the competent authority is r esponsible for public communication on food safety and risk. 3. Animal Health and Welfare The health and welfare of food producing animals is essential for public health and consumer protection (EC, 2000). Diseases like tuber culosis and salmonellosis have zoonotic character and can be transmitted from anim als to humans through ingestion of contaminated food. Zoonoses can show mild sympto ms or even lead to life- threatening conditions in humans (EFSA, 2010). Animal welfare is specifically addressed in Regulat ion (EC) 853/2004 and Regulation (EC) 854/2004 - the latter laying down the role of the official veterinarian in the control of animal welfare rules concerning protecti on of animals at the time of slaughter and during transport. Regulation (EC) 853/2004 highlights existing intera ctions between food business operators, including the animal feed sector, and co nnections between animal health, animal welfare and public health considerations at all stages of production, processing and distribution. This link is reflected in the common form of the EU framework on food hygiene, animal welfare and anima l health legislation. MC1003 - Report N.3 2010 5 Assessment of benefit to public and animal health o f post -mortem inspection of green offal in red meat species at slaughter - RISK PATHWAY 4. Introduction to the generic model To better understand the effectiveness of control t asks at slaughterhouse level - e.g. meat inspection tasks - in relation to the risk for public health, animal health and animal welfare associated with the meat production system it is important to explore sequential steps in animal production and to invest igate factors that contribute potentially to the risk either by increasing or dec reasing the quantity of hazards in fresh meat. In the generic model presented in this report the f ood chain approach is taken into account as control tasks are described and mapped o ver various steps from primary production level to transport and slaughterhouse le vel. The model follows the risk assessment framework of the Codex Alimentarius. The European legal framework on food safety and hyg iene was used to identify responsibilities of food business operators, slaugh terhouse operators and control activities of the competent authority. This informa tion serves as input to the generic model. MC1003 - Report N.3 2010 6 Assessment of benefit to public and animal health o f post -mortem inspection of green offal in red meat species at slaughter - RISK PATHWAY MATERIALS AND METHOD Firstly, basics of the risk assessment framework of the Codex Alimentarius will be described to put the outcomes of this report into c ontext with the next step - objective 5 - of the whole project. Secondly, the development of the risk pathway and also characterisation and identification of controls wil l be explained. Concluding, the European legal framework is outlined which gives ba sis to the risk pathway and control tasks to be carried out in the food chain. 5. Risk assessment - Codex Alimentarius framework The White Paper on Food Safety recognizes risk anal ysis as the foundation on which food safety policy is based. Food policy shall be d irected on the application of the three components of risk analysis: risk assessment (scientific advice and information analysis), risk management (regulation and control) and risk communication (EC, 2000) The generic model for abattoir meat inspection is c reated following the risk assessment framework of the Codex Alimentarius Comm ission. In this framework the risk assessment follows a structured approach ( FAO/WHO, 2010): Hazard identification : The identification of biological, chemical, and physical agents capable of causing adverse health e ffects and which may be present in a particular food or group of foods. Hazard characterization : The qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation of the nature of the adverse health effects associa ted with biological, chemical and physical agents which may be present i n food. For biological or physical agents, a dose-response asse ssment should be performed if the data are obtainable. Exposure assessment : The qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation of the likely intake of biological, chemical, and phys ical agents via food as well as exposures from other sources if relevant. Risk characterization : The qualitative and/or quantitative estimation, including attendant uncertainties, of the probabili ty of occurrence and severity of known or potential adverse health effec ts in a given population based on hazard identification, hazard c haracterization and exposure assessment. MC1003 - Report N.3 2010 7 Assessment of benefit to public and animal health o f post -mortem inspection of green offal in red meat species at slaughter - RISK PATHWAY A comprehensive list of hazards to public health (P H), animal health (AH) and animal welfare (AW) related to meat production was identified in objective 1 of the joint project MC1003 and MC1R0001 (see report N.1) with hazards being carefully selected in respect to their importance and impact on PH, AH and AW. That work corresponds to the step of hazard identification . Hazard characterization, risk characterization, exp osure assessment and the qualitative risk assessment per se will be the subj ect of objective 5 of this project, which focuses on the evaluation of risk for public health, animal health and animal welfare associated with the current green offal ins pection activities. Note that, in the context of this project, \"risk\" is understood as th e probability of contaminated carcases leaving the slaughterhouse into human cons umption and the potential consequences of such contamination. This report presents the development of the risk pa thway. 6. Description of risk pathway With the description of the risk pathway the steps necessary for the unwanted output of interest to occur are set out. At the basis of t hese steps, data required for the qualitative risk assessment will be identified and the use of such data will be determined. Every single step of the risk pathway is linked to a probability (P) that the hazard of interest is present and a level or concentration (N ) of that hazard in the animal or carcase. On the basis of these two factors the expo sure can be assessed. 6.1. Probability Probability (P): P measures the likelihood of prese nce of a hazard; in other terms: prevalence of infection, colonisation or contaminat ion with a hazard X or presence of a condition X (in respect to animal welfare) in/on an animal or carcase. 6.2. Hazard level Hazard level (N): N refers to the quantity of a cer tain pathogen an animal or animal carcase incorporates or is superficially contaminat ed with. Depending on the characteristics and physiology of the pathogen of i nterest this quantity may vary during the animal's production cycle. Some pathogen s are transmitted vertically, MC1003 - Report N.3 2010 8 Assessment of benefit to public and animal health o f post -mortem inspection of green offal in red meat species at slaughter - RISK PATHWAY resulting in prenatal infection (e.g. BVD in calves ); other pathogens will be picked up predominantly by a certain group of animals (e.g. Trichinella in free ranging pigs, parasites in young animals) or at a certain stage o f the food chain (e.g. cross- contamination with Salmonella spp. on the slaughter line). Following the steps of the risk pathway the level o f hazard X in/on an animal or carcase can either increase or decrease. The unit o f hazard (log concentration in faeces, number of parasites, etc.) is not specified in this generic model. Within animal welfare the terms \"level of infection \" or \"level of contamination with a hazard\" may be less suitable. In this case hazard i s understood as presence of a condition X, e.g. a broken leg or tail bite. 6.3. Interaction of control and action Two particular important elements in the risk pathw ay are formed by controls and consecutive corrective action. Control and action g o hand in hand: by means of a control a deviation from the condition aimed for to the actual condition can be recorded. The result of the control itself does not change a condition as far as a corrective action does not follow. For this \"duet\" of control and action (P) and (N) w ill be considered with following approach: (P) for control and consecutive corrective action i s a combination of Probability (P) that hazard X is detected with the respective control Probability (P) that corrective measure is taken (N) refers to the level of hazard X in/on an animal or carcase after application of the corrective measure. This factor includes both posit ive (level of hazard X decreases as a consequence of the corrective action taken) and n egative effects of the controls (increase of hazard level due to probable cross-con tamination). In relation to meat inspection tasks removal of haz ard, condemnation of organ or condemnation of the whole carcase are options for c orrective actions. 6.4. Control Regulation (EC) 882/2004 describes control activiti es as tasks related to official controls which shall, in general, be carried out us ing appropriate methods and techniques such as monitoring, surveillance, verifi cation, audit, inspection, sampling MC1003 - Report N.3 2010 9 Assessment of benefit to public and animal health o f post -mortem inspection of green offal in red meat species at slaughter - RISK PATHWAY and analysis. Inspection is referred to as one of s everal methods and techniques of control. As the model aims at embracing various steps of the food chain, the term \"control\" is used to cover the full range of checks carried out. In this sense control can either stand for official controls by the competent author ity or (self-) control by the food business operators themselves or stakeholders (as p rivate veterinary service or voluntary partnerships, see results section) contra cted to conduct certain control tasks. 6.5. Action In general, actions taken as response to controls m ay range from culling measures, medical treatment, preventive measures, changes in housing conditions, etc. to doing nothing. In the same way, effectiveness of actions undertaken will range from positive effects to no effects - or even to negativ e effects (i.e. increase of hazard level). In the generic model the effect of an action will b e displayed in form of a resulting change of the level of hazard X in/on an animal or carcase. Furthermore the frequency of action-taking may vary from daily (e.g. alertness of food business operator leading to immediate action) to once in the lifetime of the single food producing animal. 7. Characterisation and identification of controls To account for the particular role of controls in t his project, respectively meat inspection tasks, control types along the food chai n were characterised and control tasks were identified. This information will help t o give frame to the data needed as model input. To cover both pre-and post harvest areas of the foo d chain the collection of information on controls ranged from primary product ion to transport and slaughterhouse. 7.1. Characterisation of control types Roles and responsibilities in relation to controls in meat production were identified. Two important actors are food business operator and competent authority. The food business operator has responsibility to \"ensure tha t the requirements of food law are met within the food business under their control\" ( Reg. (EC) 178/2002 ). The competent authority's duty is to \"enforce feed and food law, animal heath and MC1003 - Report N.3 2010 10 Assessment of benefit to public and animal health o f post -mortem inspection of green offal in red meat species at slaughter - RISK PATHWAY animal welfare rules and monitor and verify that th e relevant requirements thereof are fulfilled by business operators at all stages o f production, processing and distribution. Official controls should be organised for that purpose\" ( Reg. (EC) 882/2004 ). 7.2. Identification of control tasks carried out To identify control tasks at primary production lev el, during transport and at slaughterhouse level the legislative texts listed i n section 4 \"Legal base\" were screened. Both controls with public health relevanc e and text passages laying down requirements in respect to animal health and animal welfare were collected and allocated. The listed tasks shall give an overview of control tasks laid out in respective legislation. Control tasks were identified by colle cting information on tasks that were particularly assigned to these persons; e.g. condit ions to ensure, guarantees to give, obligations to meet, etc. According to Regulation (EC) 882/2004 tasks related to official control activities \"shall, in general, be carried out using appropriat e control methods and techniques such as monitoring, surveillance, verification, aud it, inspection, sampling and analysis.\" Listing of inspection tasks will be done in detail for inspection tasks at slaughterhouse level as set out in Annex 1 of Regul ation (EC) 854/2004. 8. Legal base The European legislation framework on food hygiene, animal welfare and animal health legislation is based on a horizontal approac h for all food safety and hygiene rules. This was set out as prerequisite to give the legal acts ability to take rapid, effective, safeguard measures in response to health emergencies throughout the food chain (EC, 2000). The generic model is based on the assumption that l egal requirements on controls to be carried out are met and that requirements on str uctural conditions of establishments and good practices are fully impleme nted. MC1003 - Report N.3 2010 11 Assessment of benefit to public and animal health o f post -mortem inspection of green offal in red meat species at slaughter - RISK PATHWAY Common basis for the food safety and hygiene law is Regulation (EC) 178/2002 (General principles and requirements of food law). This text complemented by legislation addressing specifically the food busine ss operator and official controls. Food business operator: Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 (General rules on hygi ene of foodstuffs); Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 (Specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin). Official controls: Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 (General rules for offi cial feed and food controls); Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 (Specific rules for off icial controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption). Legislative texts which determine compliance rules for topics closely related to the hygiene legislation: Regulation (EC) 999/2001 (TSE); Directive 2002/99/EC (Animal zoonotic agents); Regulation (EC) (Animal by-products). Following crit eria: Regulation No 2073/2005 (Microbiological crite ria); Regulation (EC) No 2074/2005 (Implementing measures ); Regulation (EC) No 2075/2005 ( Trichinella testing). Rules for animal welfare during transport and slaug hter are laid down in: Directive 64/432/EEC (Transport in general and in r elation to animal welfare); Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 (Animal welfare during tr ansport); Directive (EC) 1099/2009 (Animal welfare during sla ughter and killing). MC1003 - Report N.3 2010 12 Assessment of benefit to public and animal health o f post -mortem inspection of green offal in red meat species at slaughter - RISK PATHWAY RESULTS In the first part of the results section the generi c risk pathway will be described. The second part focuses on the characterisation and ide ntification of controls. Only the structure of the information gathered is presented in this section. For detailed lists see Annex 1 (Primary production level), Annex 2 (Tr ansport) and Annex 3 (Slaughterhouse). 9. Description of the steps in the risk pathway at pri mary production, during transport and at the slaughterhouse The risk pathway of the food chain is split up into main and sub-stages. For each stage, the probability and level of hazard presence is then described. The risk pathway concentrates on production stages at primary production level, transport of animals to the slaughterhouse and slau ghter. In relation to slaughter the inspection tasks of the competent authority are map ped. Note: Data availability on single steps of the risk pathway may vary between hazards, species and different aspects of risk (PH, AH, AW). As a consequence, single steps of the risk pathway will have to be co mbined in a reasonable manner when the risk assessment is undertaken for a specif ic hazard. In general, many other inputs are required to model food-borne disease risk from primary production to slaughterhouse level. These f actors of potential concern include inter alia intrinsic and extrinsic factors in relation to the health and welfare status of an animal as well as controls and correct ive human interactions during the whole production cycle. Depending on data availability these potential fact ors will be taken in account for the actual application of the model. Structure of the risk pathway Black bullet points mark sub-stages on the risk pat hway; White bullet points specify processes which occur i n this sub-stage (left column). For every stage the output is described with the tw o factors probability (P) and level (N) of hazard X, see right column. 13 Assessment of benefit to public and animal health o f post green offal in red meat species at Figure 1: Generic risk pathway for hazard X from farm to MC1003 - Report N.3 Assessment of benefit to public and animal health o f post -mortem inspection of green offal in red meat species at slaughter - RISK PATHWAY Generic risk pathway for hazard X from farm to slaughterhouse.

Primary production unit The risk pathway (tab. 1) starts with the ultimate primary production unit / farm from where animals directly are sent to the slaught erhouse and not in any way distributed to other farms (by direct trade, throug h markets, etc.). Uncertainty linked to an animal's health status tha t was held at more than one farm during its production cycle will be taken in accoun t in the generic model with the first sub-stage on the risk pathway: by use of a p robability the provenance of the animal can be specified. Animals can either be clas sified as born on the farm or as purchased (irrespective of the number of farms wher e they used to life before). Table 1: Steps of the risk pathway at primary production lev el. The output section details probabilities of presence and level of a hazard X. Primary production unit Main and sub-stages on pathway Output Entry of the primary production unit / farm throug h birth of animal or purchase of animal P Farm 1a: probability that animal is born on farm P Farm 1b: probability that animal is purchased (not born on farm) Health status of the animal at entry into the farm P Farm 2: probability that animal is infected / hazard X is present N Farm 2: level of hazard X in/on an animal at entry into the farm Production cycle o Growing and fattening Factors of potential concern which have to be consi dered for collection of data: o Intrinsic factors /square4 Purpose of animal, breed, immunity, etc. o Extrinsic factors /square4 Contact with animals of unknown health status /square4 Feed, water source and access, environment, pest, wildlife, etc. o Control /square4 (Self-) Control by FBO, official controls o Action /square4 Actions taken upon detection of hazard /square4 Preventive measures (quarantine, vaccination, etc.) Note: factors of potential concern, including contr ols and corrective actions, influence the prevalence / prob ability of presence of a specific hazard and the concentration / level on a daily base. Generic approach to consider impact of factors of potential concern: P Farm 3 - (n): probability that animals is infected / hazard X is present as a consequence of the effect of a certain factor N Farm 3 - (n): level of hazard X in/on an animal as a consequence of the effect of a certain factor MC1003 - Report N.3 2010 15 Assessment of benefit to public and animal health o f post -mortem inspection of green offal in red meat species at slaughter - RISK PATHWAY End of production cycle Prevalence of hazard at end of production cycle o Herd prevalence o Within herd prevalence o Number of herds o Number of animals in a herd Concentration / level of hazard X at end of production cycle 9.2. Transport The stages of transport comprise loading, unloading , transfer and rest, until the unloading of the animals at the place of destinatio n is completed as outlined in legislation ( Reg. (EC) 1/2005 ); furthermore, controls and cross-contamination du ring transport are included (see tab. 2). Table 2: Steps of the risk pathway during transport.

Slaughterhouse Tab. 3 outlines the risk pathway at slaughterhouse level, starting from checking of Food Chain Information (FCI) till application of th e health mark and release of the carcase. It is acknowledged that single steps on the process ing line are executed in parallel with meat inspection (and not in succession), as po inted out in fig. 1. It is also acknowledged that logistical layout of processing l ines differs between slaughterhouses, resulting in variation of the cour se of processing steps and meat inspection tasks (MIT) at a certain time. As a comp romise, processing steps and MIT are mapped down one after the other in the tabular form. For an evaluation of the effectiveness of a specifi c MIT the risk pathway will be subject to adaption according to the explicit risk question. Cross-contamination in the slaughter hall (e.g. due to splashing, physical contact between two carcases, insufficient cleaning and dis infection of slaughter hall after finishing slaughter process) and corrective measure s (e.g. trimming and washing) are not included as a stand-alone step in the risk path way, but are included in (P) and (N) of every single step.

Only application of obligatory meat inspection tasks is included in this pathway. Ani mals put aside (see fig, 1 - in lairage) or animals that have to undergo emergency slaughter are not followe d up as we assume that a range of additional control tasks are applied to these animals. This ha ndling and attention is deemed not to be representative for the majority of animals sent to slaughter.

Characterisation and identification of control task s The overview presented in this section is limited t o the structure of the information gathered. For a range of detailed tables see Annex 1 (Primary production level), Annex 2 (Transport) and Annex 3 (Slaughterhouse). 10.1. Control tasks at primary production level Without prejudice to the food business operator and the competent authority as main actors two additional control types are listed (pri vate veterinary service and voluntary partnership). The reason for this is to p oint out presence of additional stakeholders at the farm establishments and complex ity of interaction of hazard level, control activities and actions taken. 10.1.1.

Competent authority: See Annex 1, tab. 11 for general obligations and co ntrol activities of the competent authority. 10.2. Control tasks during transport from live animals to the slaughterhouse Transport operations take place between primary pro duction unit and slaughterhouse.

MC1003 - Report N.3 2010 23 Assessment of benefit to public and animal health o f post -mortem inspection of green offal in red meat species at slaughter - RISK PATHWAY DISCUSSION The White Paper on Food Safety (EC, 2000) advertise d the ability of the new European Legislation framework on food safety and h ygiene to take rapid, effective, safeguard measures in response to health emergencie s throughout the food chain. The imperative prerequisite is formed by availabili ty of reliable data (WHO, 2001), either in form of the relevant food chain informati on or results gained through research. Known limitations of this horizontal approach to th e food chain are precisely data gaps as records of integrated food-borne disease mo nitoring and surveillance programs, including human food-borne illnesses, foo d-borne pathogens in food animals and foods of animal origin demonstrate a su bstantial variation in quality and validity (EFSA, 2010; WHO, 2001). Identification of effective pre-harvest interventio ns for food-borne pathogens and measurement and documentation of the contribution o f pre-harvest interventions to the reduction of food-borne illness was out of the scope of this study. Nevertheless the generic model described here strongly relates t o the link of controls and measures taken during food production. Application of the generic model to a real scenario will have to handle data gaps. One strategy to tackle this challenge is to focus l ess on details of the risk pathway but to evaluate the impact of measures in relation to t heir interactive role in the food chain framework. In addition, alternative tools of data retrieval can be applied (e.g. questionnaire survey or expert consultation). The model will be adapted to fit the needs of the s pecific types of hazards under consideration (i.e. AH, AW, PH). The structured approach of the model will allow ide ntification of the crucial step on the integrated risk pathway where data gaps exist.

EXECUTIVE SUMMA RY Background Meat inspection (MI) in the abattoir is an important component in the process of protecting consumers from meat related hazards . It consists of a series of steps of inspection of the live animal, the carcase and its organs with the aim of detecting, identifying and removing pathological findings. Nowadays , in more economically developed countries, the main threat to public health (PH) from meat consumpt ion comes from hazards that do no t cause obvious disease or clinical signs in the animal or the carcase. In light of this , it has been argued that the traditional MI system is not the most appropriate method to detect and control these hazards . In addition, some of the obligatory MI practices, like the incision of organs and lymph nodes (LNs), may be even contributing to cross -contamination of carcases potentially aggravating the problem . Eliminating MI tasks that do not greatly contribute to the detection of hazards would free resources that could be used elsewhere for the control of meatborne diseases. In order to do this, an objective evaluation of the true effectiveness of all MI tasks in relation to the most prominent hazards is needed . Aims and objectives The aim of the work present ed in this report was the development of a computer based model for the qualitative assessment of the effectiveness of meat inspection tasks to detect hazards associated with meat production (i.e. capacity of detection of hazard ). Approach With the objective of identifying the essential elements that should be part of an MI effectiveness assessment tool, a workshop was organised with all project team members (including international partners) and representatives from the Food Standards Agency (FSA ). On the basis of the workshop outcome, a tool was developed that measure s the effectiveness of each MI task to detect a particular hazard as a combination of sensitivity (Se) and positive predictive value (PPV). These are two common parameters used to characterize diagnostic tests in, among others, animal and human medicine. The model produce s, for each MI task, a score out of five categories (very low, VL; lo w, L; medium, M; high , H; very high , VH) that represents the task's capacity to detect a given hazard. 3 The model has been tested on a selection of seven hazards, including public health (PH), animal health (A H) and animal welfare (AW) hazards. Outcome/Key Results Obtained On initial validation , the tool showed a good discriminatory capacity (between effective and ineffective tasks) , wh ich ensure s that appropriate relative comparison s of effectiveness among MI tasks can be drawn from the model outputs . Further validation of the model with a greater number of hazards would be needed to confirm the suitability of the model output for a greater range of situations. Nevertheless , the results obtained to date are promising and further work should be encouraged. Not surprisingly, the model validation demonstrated that the current MI system as a whole is most effective at detect ing those hazards that cause either pathognomic , macroscopic or multisystemic lesions . Across the range of hazards tested as part of this project , the most effective MI task s (higher scoring) were visual inspection of the intestines, followed by ante mortem and whole carcase inspection. The hazard that could be detected by most MI tasks was classical swine fever in pigs. The lack of reliable data and information needed to inform the model represent s the greatest constraint encountered in this project . It will require a substantial amount of field -based research to obtain more precise data. Once this is available, the tool will be a very solid and valuable instrument in the evaluation of MI tasks . 4 2.

Final 3. BACKGROUND Today , Campylobacter, Salmonella, Yersinia and Escherichia coli O157 are among the most important meatborne pathogens causing human disease (EFSA, 2010 ). These hazards are usually transmitted through faecal or cross -contamination to the carcase during the slaughter process and generally do not cause clinical signs or obvious lesions in infected animal s (Snijders and van Knapen, 2002 ). As a result , these hazards are virtually undetectable with t he current meat inspection (MI) system, which relies on the detection of macroscopic lesions in the carcase and organs . In addition, some MI task s may even aggravate the problem by contributing unnecessarily to the cross -contamination of carcases. In this context it has been argued that the MI system as a whole, and some MI tasks in particular, are not fit for purpose anymore and should be overhauled by more suitable mechanisms to address the current threats to human health (Snijders and van Knapen, 2002 , Berends et al., 1996 ). Eliminating tasks that do not co ntribute in any substantial way to the detection of hazards would free resources that could be used elsewhere for the control of meatborne diseases (Edwards et al., 1997 ). Nevertheless, in order to do this, it is necessary to objectively assess to what extent each current MI task contribut es to the protect ion of animal health, animal welfare and public health. This report present s the development of a computer based model to objectively assess the effectiveness of the MI tasks in relation to specific hazards . In the context of this project effectiveness is un derstood as the capacity of a MI task to detect a specific hazard , be it a hazard to human health, animal health and animal welfare. This report includes a description of the basic principles underlying the model and the results of a validation study with a specific number of hazards. The tool allow s the relative compar ison of effectiveness among MI tasks for each specific hazard and the identif ication of those tasks that contribute most to the detection of hazard s. The activities presented in this report are separated in two parts: The first part consisted of the organisation and delivery of a workshop with project partners , to discuss the parameters underlying the tool . The workshop outcomes , including the description of the model parameters, are d escribed in detail in report N.2. The second part was the development of an effectiveness evaluation tool based on the outcomes 7 of the workshop . Finally we carried out an initial validation of the model on seven hazards . 8 4. MATERIALS AND METHOD S 4.1 Definitions and reference populations The population of reference in our model is the population of animals that are infected with (or carry) a hazard (population of infected animals, P). Therefore, the effectiveness score produced by the model indicates the capacity of a MI task to detect a hazard in infected animals . The subpopulations of relevance in the model are described in figure 1. Figure 1 - Sub-populations of relevance in the model where, P = Animals infected with/carrying a hazard p = Proportion of infected animals that show clinical signs/lesions. p = the proportion of p animals with lesions in a particular organ p = the proportion of p animals that are detected by the MI ta sk As described in detail in report N.2 of project MC1003 , the effectiveness of a meat inspection task can be defined by two parameters: Sensitivity (Se) = the ability of the task to correctly detect infected animals WITH lesions or \"the proportion of in fected animals WITH LESIONS that are identified by the task as infected(Fletcher and Fletcher, 2005 ). In this project, t he formula describing Se is: Se = p*p 9 Positive Predictive Value (PPV ) = the probability that a sample (carcase) identified as positive by a task is truly positive (Fletcher and Fletcher, 2005 ) (MacMahon and Trichopoulos, 1996 ). The = + (1 -p)(1 -Sp) where, Sp = Specificity , the ability of a task to identify animals without lesions or \"the proportion of animals without lesions that are identified by a task as negative . Sensitivity alone does not give a clear indication of how effective a task is at detect ing a hazard , because the effectiveness of a test (e.g. meat inspection task) is also influenced by the prevalence of the hazard in the tested population. Therefore , irrespective of sensitivity, the likelihood that a task will detect a hazard is greater if the hazard is more prevalent in the populati on.. The PPV value increases as the prevalence increases, i.e. the proportion of rejections that are unnecessary will be lower. It follows that the effectiveness of a task increase s with the prevalence of a condition /hazard in a population. The relations hip between the parameters described in this paragraph, is presented in table 1. Table 1 - Se, Sp and PPV HAZARD PRESENT HAZARD ABSEN T TOTALS TEST POSITIVE a b a + b TEST NEGATIVE c d c + d TOTALS a + c b + d a + b + c + d Se = a/a+c; Sp = d/b+d; PPV = a/a+b 4.2 Description of the model The model (available as a separate file: Model .xls) combines , for each meat inspection task, the estimates of Se and PPV relative to a specific hazard. The final qualitative estimate fall s in one of five categories: very low (VL), low (L), medium 10 (M), high (H) or very high (VH) effectiveness. See annex 1 for a representation of the model process. 4.2.1 Model parameters The list of model input parameters can be seen in figure 2 . Figure 2 - Representation of m odel input parameters (green) Parameter s p, p and p are obtained from published literature, databases and/or expert opinion. Parameters in red font are automatically calculated by the model. Se is obtain ed through p and p and PPV through p, Se and Sp, as described previously . Specificity (Sp) was entered as a fixed value for all the tasks/hazards ; it is very unlikely that organs without lesion will be identified as having a lesion and rejected; in other words, it is very unlikely for an inspector to declare an organ or carcase positive for a particular hazard when there are no lesions on the organs . In addition, it was assumed that there is a very low likelihood of misclassification of other diseases (i.e. orga ns/carcases carrying a different hazard being incorrectly identified as carrying the hazard of interest). In light of this, and a ccording to the definition of Sp in this project ( see above ) it was decided that a Sp=0.99 is a realistic estimate for all haza rds/tasks considered . To validate this assumption , the PPV values obtained through expert elicitation for a number of tasks/hazards were compare d with the PPV values computed by the model for the same tasks /hazards when using Sp = 0.99. The results showed a very good correlation between the two PPVs for the pig conditions studied , supporting the choice of specificity used in the model . The correlation was weaker for hazards related to sheep and cattle; nevertheless, only one expert contributed information on these species as it was not possible to recruit a 11 second expert , therefore the results of this validation can only be partially assessed. The results of th e validation are reported in annex 2. 4.2.2 Conversion of Se and PPV to qualitative scores After computing Se and PPV parameters in the model they are converted into qualitative estimates . Specifically , on the basis of their numerical value, they are converted to one of five qualitative score categories , ranging from very low (VL) to very high (VH). This was done by defining a numerical range for each qualitative category . Each Se and PPV figure is then assigned to one of the ranges . The model differentiates between t wo main types of meatborne hazards: (i) hazards that ma y not (or rarely) cause visible lesions and, if they do so , they are not accompanied by characteristic, macroscopical findings ( micro -hazards\") - hazards typical of this group are Campylobacter , Toxoplasma and Salmonella ; and (ii ) hazard s typically accompanied by obvious and characteristic macroscopical findings (macro - hazards\") - hazards like M. bovis , Cysticercus spp and Fasciola hepatica fall into this category . The qualitative scoring for both these types of hazards is different (see table 2). The sensitivities for macro -hazards are higher than for the micro -hazards, PPVs are also higher as they are partially dependent on Se. As the qualitative score describes relative performance, a high sensitivity (or PPV) for a micr o-hazard would be relatively low for a macro -hazard, therefore a different scale is required to qualitatively describe relative performance for micro - and macro -hazards. 12 Table 2 - Qualitative categorization for Se and PPV The decision on the appropriate categorization of parameters (as described above), was made by four members of the research team in two separate workshops. The most important aspect s considered by the project members w ere that the ranges: should be realistic and sensible (i.e. a sensitiv ity for a given hazard defined in categorization as high should be in agreement with the most prevailing opinion in the expert community) should provide adequate power of discrimination for the comparison of tasks . 4.2.3. Final task score In the model, t he combination of the qualitative categories of Se and PPV parameters produces a final effectiveness score (from VL to VH). Discussion among team members was the basis for the Se/PPV combination matrix finally integrated in the model (see table 3 for detai ls of the matrix ). HAZARD CATEGORIESSe VL L 13 Table 3 - Final task effectiveness scores Sensitivity is an indicator of false negatives (i.e. the proportion of infected carcases with lesions that are not identified ), while PPV is an indicator of the proportion of detected carcases that are false positives , i.e. unnecessary rejections . This in turn means that Se is of greater PH, AH and AW importance (i.e. lower Se means that more positive carcases are not detected by the task, with any consequence s this may have on PH, AH or AW) and PPV of greater economic/financial. This important fact was taken into account when designing the final score matrix ; Se was given greater weight toward s the final score than PPV. The aim was to reflect that the primary purpose of a MI task is to safeguard PH, AH and/or AW. For each hazard, t he final score produced by the model for one inspection task is directly comparable to the score of other inspection tasks along the slaughter line allowing for the relative ranking of inspection tasks in relation to the ir capacity to detect the given hazard . The score can also be compared to the score obtain ed for the same inspection task in relation to any other hazard s of the same category (micro/macro). 4.3 Model valida tion 4.3.1 Selection of hazards In order to test the model a number of hazards were selected and applied to the model. A selection of seven hazards was made in consultation with the Food Standards Agency (FSA).

The objective was to test the model in the broadest possible range of conditions in order to expose any eventual weaknesses and limitations. Selected hazards and their characteristics are presented in table 4 . Table 4 - List of selected hazards for validation 4.3.2 Collection of data and information To obtain the required input parameters for the model we consulted several sources of information. I n the first instance, scientific literature and databases of various agencies and public bodies (main ly FSA and VLA) were consulted . When data gaps were identified, information was collected via expert elicitation and, if this step failed to provide the required data, the opinion of the project members was incorporated , based on their collective knowledge and experience. A full list of the databases , reports and scientific literature used in the testing of the tool can be seen in Annex 3. Whenever the figures reported in two or more sources were found to be conflicting or incompatible a prioritisation process was implemented. The criteria for this process were, in ranking order: source referring to UK source referring to Europe date relevance of properties of animals referred to (species, age of animals, sex etc.) HAZARD Species Risk CategoryEndemic/ NotifiableSingle / Multiple sitesGrowth on carcaseLesions inGO M.bovis Cattle AH E M NO YES MAP Cattle AH E M NO YES TOXOPLASMA Sheep PH E M NO YES SALMONELLA Pigs PH E M YES YES CSF Pigs AH N M NO YES HERNIAS Pigs AW E S NO YES TAIL BITING Pigs AW E S NO NO 15 Expert opinion con sultation Up to two experts were identified for both ante -mortem and post -mortem inspection and for each animal species of interest - cattle (C), sheep (S) and pigs (P). The experts for AM were Official Veterinarians ( OVs ) while for PM were meat inspectors (MIs) currently working in UK abattoirs. Further selection criteria were , first, the experts' experience (see table 5 for details on the experience requirements) in the hazard of interest and, second ly, their willingness to participate in the project. Table 5 - Experts' selection; Minimum experience requirements Identified candidates were approached and invited to participate in the expert elicitation . Given the fact that many abattoirs in the UK that slaughter large numbers of sheep also process many cattle , the same experts were used for both animal species . The abattoirs w here experts were employed are all located in the south of England but receive livestock from across the UK. The ir production throughput is medium to high (i.e. >3,000 sheep/wk, >20 0 cattle/wk, >5,000 pigs/wk). The characteristics of the animals slaughtered can be considered as representative for the UK as a whole . The profiles of the six selected experts are provided in annex 4. The expert elicitation was done through a modified Del phi technique. Briefly, a first round of data gathering was run by individual questionnaires sent to experts via email . After that , data from experts were collated. A second elicitation round was run via email and/or telephone call in order to clarify some of the experts' responses or reach consensus when disagreements on estimates were found. Finally, final estimates were calculated.

To obtain the necessary data s cientists work ing in EU laboratories deal ing specifically with CSF ( e.g. reference laboratories) were invited to pa rticipate. These experts had knowledge of post mortem details and frequency of findings of the disease in certain countries . This information was then extrapolated to the MI process in the abattoir environment (see notes in CSF sheet, file Model with data .xls). A list of CSF experts can be seen in Annex 4. The protocol for the extraction of data from questionnaires from two different experts can be seen in Annex 5. 4.3.3. Model revision The model, together with supporting documentation, was sent to the international partners for revision (Lis Alban, Danish Agriculture & Food Council, Denmark ; Lueppo Ellerbroek, Food Institute for Risk Analysis, Germany) . They were asked for their general feedback and to comment specifically on: the correctness of the ass umptions in the model the presence of any obvious mistakes the clarity of the model the scoring system and, in particular, its discrimination capacity the ranges for the categorisation of Se and PPV 17 5. RESULTS The feedback of the international partners on the model was positive . The finalized model is provided as a separate file ( Model .xls) including all relevant notes and instructions. The results of the validation for all MI tasks and all considered hazards can be viewed in detail in the separate file Model with data .xls. Table 6 presents a summary of the results . Table 6 - Selected hazards and MI tasks effectiveness scores * Capacity of detection of Mycobacterium bovis (TB) in cattle by MI tasks The results of the model show that three MI tasks have a solid detection capacity with regard to M. bovis in cattle : the se are the inspection of the mediastinal LNs (detection capacity high), the retropharyngeal LNs (detection c apacity medium ) and the bronchial LNs (detection capacity medium ). Considering the failure rate of the TB farm surveillance tests [average Se 90%, (de la Rua -Domenech et al., 2006 )] and the number of TB slaughterhouse cases (i.e. carcases found with TB lesions in animals that were not reactors) found in the UK abattoirs during routine meat inspection , a CATTLE CATTLE SHEEP PIGS PIGS PIGS PIGS TB MAP Toxoplasma Salmonella CSF Hernias Tail biting VL VL VL L H VH VH VL M L VL VH VL VH HEAD Mouth, tonsils etc. VL H Retrophar.

Some of these animals originate from farms not previously identified as TB infected. Assuming that early detection is imperative for the success of the control of the hazard on farm and within the national herd, th ese three MI tasks do make an important contribution . There are six more tasks that literature suggests can play a role in the detection of the disease : ante -mortem inspection, inspection of the whole carcase, inspection of the mouth and tonsils, parotid LNs, parenchyma of the lungs and mesenteric LNs . The model indicates a very low capacity of detection of these tasks, due primarily to the low frequency with which lesions associated with M. bovis are found in the organs and tissues inspected by these tasks. Capacity of detection of Mycobacterium avium can be detected by five MI tasks: the ante mortem inspection, the visual inspection of the whole carcase and the three inspection tasks of GO (i.e. visual inspection of the intestines and the mesentery and palpation of the mesenteric LNs) . The contribution of the GO inspection, in particular the inspection of the intesti nes (score high), to the detection of MAP is not surprising given that those organs are the target location for the pathogen in infected animals , causing very characteristic lesions . The relatively high score (medium ) of the whole carcase visual inspection (looking for emaciation) in the detection of MAP was more surprising, because it is a finding that is common to many other chronic diseases and conditions (e.g. old age). It is however very easy to detect and, according to an external expert, an animal wi th emaciation should not be missed (Annex V. 2.1.ii). Therefore, it is expected that a large proportion of animals with lesions will be detected by this specific MI task and th is, together with the relatively high proportion of infected animals show ing pathological findings (i.e. high p value ), will result in a final medium effectiveness score . Ante mortem inspection contribute s to a much small er degree to the detection of the hazard (score very low ), due primarily to the low sensitivity of the task in relation to this hazard . Capacity of detection of Toxoplasma gondii in sheep 19 Toxoplasma gondii is very widespread among the sheep population in the UK, like in many other European countries. It is primarily associated with abortions in ewes and, rarely, with disease in lambs . The disease is usually multi -systemic but with very mild and no n specific signs and lesions (Radostits, 2000 ). This means that at MI the hazard can easily be missed (low Se), while its lesions can be confused with those of other hazards, usually parasites . The nature of this hazard is reflected in the results of the model, where there are many MI tasks with a theoretical potential for detection, although no MI task scored higher than low. Nevertheless considering the large amount of small ruminants being slaughtered in the UK per year, a MI task with a low or very low capacity of detection (in relative terms) would still contribute to the detection of a subs tantial number of positive animals in the country (in absolute terms). Capacity of detection of Salmonella Typhimurium in pigs Salmonella Typhimurium is the major Salmonella serotype that causes disease in humans through pig meat consumption. Pigs are normally carriers of the hazard (colonization happens usually before slaughter age) but very rarely show clinical signs . The typical disease picture is enterocolitis and, very rarely, sep ticaemia . For this reason t he evaluation of this hazard dealt only with the typical (enterocolitis) form of the disease . Salmonel la can be detected by five tasks. Of them, whole carcase inspection, gastric LNs inspection and mesenteric LNs inspection had a very low score while ante mortem inspection produced a low score . The most effective task is, as expected, the inspection of the intestines (very high) . This last score is explained by the fact that, an animal showing signs of Salmonella infection is highly likely to present clinical signs in this particular organ ; effectively the only expression of salmonella in pigs is enterocolitis (Straw, 1999 ). The results for Salmonella indicate that the inspection of the intestines plays a very important role in the identification of organs that may carry th is pathogen . However, it is important to point out that the real risk to human health does not come from th e diseased animals (or animals with lesions), which constitute only a very small part of the infected animal population , but from the faecal contamination of the carcases during the slaughter process when ever subclinically infected animals are slaughtered. Salmonella on those carcases cannot be detected by any MI task . Faecal 20 contamination of the carcase is frequently used as a proxy for potential contamination with Salmonella . This aspect was beyond the scope of this work and has n ot been addressed in this project . Capacity of detection of Classical Swine Fever (CSF) in pigs CSF is the hazard for which the MI system as a whole showed the greatest capacity of detection ; most MI tasks scored higher than VL and, in addition, it include s more tasks scoring H and VH than for the other hazards. The explanation for this lies in the fact that in non -endemic countries , like the UK, where the entire pig population is fully susceptible to this virus, the majority of animals that get infected are likely to develop clinical signs ( lesions ). In addition, the clinical and pathologica l picture of this disease is severe. A diseased animal is unlikely to go undetected during MI. The hazard also attacks many organs and other parts of the body and so i t can be detected by many MI tasks. This means that, considering the number of pigs slaughtered in big commercial abattoirs and the variety of farms and regions they originate from, and also the difficulty of detection of the disease on the farm by clinica l inspection, MI in abattoirs can act as a very effective surveillance tool for the early detection of the disease. Capacity of detection of umbilical hernias in pigs There are two most frequent types of h ernias observed in pigs: umbilical and inguinal. This part of the project deals only with the former ones , given that it is more frequent, affects equally both males and females and it is more likely to be identified at post -mortem inspection . On the slaughter line, all umbilical hernias are removed from carcase s at evisceration. The structures related with hernia s (skin, connective tissue s etc.) are attached to, and follow, the green offal (GO) and can be seen during GO MI. It follows that the most important MI task for the detection of hernias are likel y to be the GO inspection. Also, a significant proportion of the hernias are accompanied by peritoni tis, a secondary complication . The model indicates that the MI tasks with greater capacity of detection for hernias are the GO inspection, the inspection of the peritoneum and the ante mortem inspection of animals in the lairage. The capacity of detection of the hazard through whole carcase inspection is very low , since hernias have always been removed from the carcase by 21 that stage. The two most important t asks for the detection of this hazard are the AM inspection and the inspection of the intestines , both scoring VH, while the value of the inspection of the peritoneum is high (H), mainly related to the remnants of secondary peritonitis that frequently appear in the abdominal cavity of pigs with hernia . Capacity of detection of tail biting in pigs Signs of t ail biting can either be found on the tail or , in more severe cases, in various other sites on the carcase as a result of metastatic conditions. Thes e conditions are frequently multiple abscess es in various organs, lymph nodes and parts of the carcase ( e.g. vertebral column) . This part of the project deals only with the primary site lesion and does not take into account the secondary complications as these are variable both in terms of frequency of appearance and location in the carcase and organs . The only two MI tasks with a capacity of detection for tail biting are AM inspection and whole carcase inspection. Since the condition is external and relatively easy to detect , the value of these tasks was expected to be high. This was confirmed by the model, with scores of VH for both inspection tasks . It was surprising , to a degree, to see that both tasks have the same high score , since it is more dif ficult at AM inspection , under lairage conditions, to detect the same proportion of affected animals compared to the whole carcase post mortem inspection , where every pig is inspected under good lighting conditions and the carcases have previously been washed and de haired . The value of these two MI tasks , from an AW point of view , is great and they can be used very effectively for surveillance purposes of AW cases . Moreover , detection of tail biting contributes also to the protection of public health . This is because many abattoirs do not routinely split pig carcases along the vertebral column but do so only when tail biting lesions are found. It is known that even small biting lesions on the tail can act as entry points for pyogenic bacteria which ca n cause abscessation which cannot be detected without carcase splitting (Kritas and Morrison, 2007 ). 22 6. DISCUSSION To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the firs t time that a tool for the assessment of the effectiveness of meat inspection tasks has been created . The tool developed in this project has the ability to differentiat e meat inspection tasks according to their effectiveness in detecting lesions produced by a particular hazard. One advantage of the tool is that it is inherently flexible and can be tailored to the needs of the end user. Thus, the reference population could be the total animal population, the population of infected animals (like in this case) , the population of infected animals with lesions or just the population of animals in one particular region. In the same way , Se and Sp could be def ined differently. The final result is that there is an objective estimate of MI tasks that can be used to prioritize inspection practices at the slaughterhouse . On validation t here wa s satisfactory discrimination between the tasks in a hazard ; this could be further improved by adapting the ranges of the Se and PPV values. More accurate and reliable data wi ll lead to better determination of these ranges and, finally, to bette r discrimination between tasks. The results of the validation are generally in agreement with prevailing opinion , however, the capacity of specific tasks to detect micro -hazards was higher than expected. It must be noted that the results refer to the population of infected animals (prevalence =1) , not the entire animal population. Also, hazards that cause obvious and multi -systemic conditions to a great proportion of infected animals , like septicaemias and viraemias , are detected by a large number of MI tasks and with high efficiency scores. This underlines the importance of the MI system in the early detection of these hazards, which are often of epidemic nature and of notifiable statu s (e.g. CSF). MI tasks for the detection of conditions that are external and easily identifiable also score d high (tail biting). Another interesting finding is that only 2 0 of the 33 legally required MI tasks were able to contribute to the detection of th e assessed hazards. This would have been even lower had CSF not been included in the selection. Although only preliminary conclusion s can be drawn from this initial validation , it could nevertheless mean that across the spectrum of hazards, many MI tasks play a negligible role in hazard detection. On the other hand, the MI system does not consist of independent but 23 rather 'interdependent' and interconnected tasks. It is a very complicated system and, while it may be possible to measure the performance of a task in separation, it is more complex to do this in t he context of the whole system. In this model, the most important parameters influencing the final score of a task were shown to be p, p and p. The capacity of detection of MI tasks depends on the frequency with which a hazard produces lesions in infected animals . It is therefore of paramount importance that the figures for these particular parameters are precise and accurate . The main limitation of the t ool relates to the need for accurate and reliable data , which was often lacking . The r eliability of the model output depends on the accuracy of the input figures . Although we used a range of sources of information for the input parameters and cross -checked information sources , most of the input parameters were derived from expert opinion. D ata is lacking in terms of the capacity of tasks to identify hazards and more work should be done in order to improve the reliability of the model outcomes. 24 7.

The scope of objective 4 was to create a generic risk pathway of meat inspection (MI) by mapping inspection tasks at slaughterhouse level, during transport and at primary production level. In objective 5, this risk pathway is used as the basis for a qualitative assessment of the risk to public health (PH), animal health (AH) and animal welfare (AW) for a selection of h azards in the context of the current and alternative green offal (GO) inspection activities. This aim is achieved via the following tasks: Development of a risk assessment framework for the MI process; Development of a qualitative score system of the level of risk to PH, AH and AW; Evaluation of risk associated with different \"inspection scenarios\"; 6 MATERIALS AND METHODS 1. Research questions The work addressed three questions, reflecting the diverse aspects of hazards and lesions in slaughtered animals. Ev ery question was separately assessed for seven hazards. Scenario 1 - current GO inspection 1) What is the probability of a carcase carrying hazard X or a condition associated with hazard X (see box 1 for details) at point of chilling under the current pra ctice of green offal inspection ? Scenario 2 - visual GO inspection 2) How does the probability of a carcase carrying hazard X or a condition associated with hazard X change if only visual inspection is carried out on green offal (i.e. gastric and mesenteric lymph nodes are not palpated? Scenario 3 - absence of GO inspection 3) How does the probability of a carcase carrying hazard X or a condition associated with hazard X change in the absence of gree n offal inspection ? The estimates obtained above are then used to make an evaluation of the changes in risks for PH, AH and AW derived from the different GO inspection scenarios. Definitions Green offal is defined in this project as: stomachs, guts, mesentery, and gastric and mesenteric lymph nodes. In the context of this project, the terms \"probability of carcases carrying a hazard\" and \"probability of carcases carrying a condition associated with a hazard\" will be interchangeably us ed with \"hazard prevalence\" and \"lesion prevalence\" respectively. 7 2. Risk assessment - Codex Alimentarius framework The generic model for risk assessment is based on Codex Alimentarius Commission standards [1] with the following components: (Risk pathway) Hazard identification Hazard characterization Exposure assessment Risk characterization Box 1. Presence of hazard versus presence of lesion /condition Depending on which of the three aspects of risk (PH, AH and AW) is considered, either \"presence of hazard\" or \"presence of lesion/condition\" are the parameters of relevance. Parameters relevant to Public Health Food -borne pathogens - if ingested by the consumer - have the potential to cause clinical signs, ranging from mild to life -threatening conditions in humans. Therefore, presence of hazard constitutes a potential risk to human health. Parameters relevant to Animal Health The animal health findings at the abattoir are valuable in the context of AH surveillance and in particular for early detection of notifiable diseases. I f an infected animal goes to slaughter, the following two detection levels are to be considered: o Lesion not detected A lesion may not be detected and therefore the hazard will still be present in/on the carcase with a risk of silent spread. The parameter of interest in this case is the probability of a carcase carrying a n undetected lesion at the point of chilling. o Haza rd not confirmed When a lesion is detected but the specific hazard is not confirmed with appropriate testing (and the carcase is therefore not rejected), this will result in the delay of the detec tion of an outbreak and allow for silent spread. In this ca se, the parameter of interest is the probability of a carcase carrying a hazard at the point of chilling . Parameters relevant to Animal Welfare As with AH, the information gathered during MI can be communicated to the farm of origin or the authorities to u ltimately result in a better AW status at the production site as well as during transport . The parameter of most importance is therefore the probability of an animal carrying the lesion at the point of chilling. 8 2.1. Risk pathway The risk assessment focuses on the steps that occur at the abattoir, from the point where animals enter the abattoir (e.g. lairage) to the point where dressed carcases are health marked and enter the chilling room (fig. 1). The first module in the model represents the lairage, where FCI is checked and ante-mortem inspection is carried out. Based on these two controls, a decision is made as to whether animals should go on to routine slaughter or are con sidered not fit for slaughter. After this step, slaughter begins with stunning and follows with the carcase dressing until the stage of evisceration. In some species (bovines), removal of the head is carried out at this stage for consequent head inspection . After the evisceration phase, i.e. removal of red offal and GO, these offal are inspected. Carcase dressing continues after evisceration until the end of the slaughter line, where the dressed carcase is inspected and, if approved, sent to the chilling ro om. The risk assessment models the inspection tasks that occur along the MI process. For each hazard, only those inspection practices that are likely to impact on the lesion/hazard prevalence along the slaughter process are modelled (i.e. heart inspection is not considered in the risk assessment relative to Mycobacterium bovis , as the contribution of this MI task to the detection of this hazard is known to be negligible; information was based on finding s from previous parts of the project - see Report N.1). Furthermore, for some of the hazards, additional steps are considered whenever relevant (see later chapters for more details). Figure 2 shows a graphic representation of the risk pathway. The final estimate in this risk assessment is the proportion of carcases with a hazard (or condition) at the chiller in a single slaughter day . This output, for each of the three scenarios simulated, is the basis for the final risk estimation. 9 Figure 1: Representation of slaughter process and relevant main inspection steps. Inspection practices modelled Scenarios Lairage Stunning Carcase dressing to evisceration Evisceration Carcase dressing after evisceration Carcase at the end of slaughter line Carcase at the beginning of chilling FCI checking and ante -mortem inspection Head inspection (if applicable) Red offal inspection Green offal inspection 1.

GO inspection scenarios modelled The following three scenarios of GO inspection are modelled for each hazard: Scenario 1 - \"Traditional\": Inspection of GO as laid down in Regulation (EC) No.854/2004 for cattle and pigs; Visual inspection of stomach and intestines, mesentery, gastric and mesenteric lymph nodes; Palpation of gastric and mesenteric lymph nodes. Scenario 2 - \"Visual\": Only visual inspection of stom ach and intestines, mesentery, gastric and mesenteric lymph nodes; No palpation of lymph nodes; For small ruminants this scenario is already in place as the current requirements involve only visual inspection of GO. Scenario 3 - \"Absent\": Absence of all GO inspection tasks; Absence of all GO inspection is illegal/non -compliant under the current European legislation. The risk difference between scenario s 2 and 3, and between scenario s 1 and 3 can be interpreted as an estimate of the proportion of carcases ca rrying the hazard which are only detected via GO inspection. 2.2. Hazard identification A comprehensive list of hazards to PH, AH and AW related to meat production was identified in objective 1 of project MC1003 (see report N.1). In consultation with the Food S tandards Agency, seven hazards were selected as the focus of this part of the project. The selection, which followed the steps outlined below, was made so as to represent a broad range of hazards. 12 Selection process : Step 1: Hazards that cannot be detec ted with GO inspection were excluded. The reason is that no change in risk can be observed for such hazards as a consequence of changes in GO inspection1. Step 2: Hazards/conditions that are primarily present in/on very young animals (calves, young lambs , and piglets) were excluded in order to concentrate on hazards relevant to the age groups of bovines, small ruminants and swine most commly slaughter ed. The final selection included the following hazards (in brackets the disease related to the hazard): Public Health interest: Classical Swine Fever virus (CSF) in pigs; Animal Welfare interest : Abdominal and inguinal hernia in pigs; Tail bite in pigs. 2.3. Hazard characterization Hazards were characteri sed according to the following aspects: Values at risk: o PH, AH, AW; Animal species: o Bovines, small ruminants, pigs; Detection in a single or in multiple organ system(s): 1 Given its animal welfare significance, and after consultation with the Food Standards Agency, it was decided to include \"tail bite\" among the selected hazards despite not being detectable at GO inspection. 13 o Tail bite [single] vs. all other hazards [multiple] ; Endemic and exotic notifiable diseases (i.e. not currently present in the country): o TB [endemic] vs. CSF - contamination): o Salmonella -contamination ] vs. [not visible] . 2.4. Exposure assessment The exposure assessment requires the estimation of the \"likelihood of a carcase carrying a hazard/condition\" at every step along the risk pathway. The combination of these \"step -probabilities\" produces the final likelihood estimate for a specific hazard. Within step probabilities: For each step in the model a \"probability of a carcase carrying a hazard/lesion at that step in the chain\" is estimated according to three parameters (box 2): o Probability of the organ carrying a lesion o Probability of detection of that lesion by specific MI tasks o Probability that a corrective action is taken The within -step probabilities are depen dent, and therefore the three probabilities above were combined according to the matrix provided in table 6, annex 1 (see for further explanations). 14 Final probability : During ante- and post-mortem inspection, a series of inspection tasks is carried out leading to the classification of carcases or parts of it as fit or unfit. Every MI task can be interpreted as a \"test\". The general concept of MI is that the results of all single inspection tasks are interpreted in parallel . With parallel interpretation, animals are considered positive (\"lesion is present\") if they are found positive at one or more of the inspection task s. In quantitative terms the combined sensitivity of various meat inspection tasks can be calculated with the following formula [2]: SeP = Se1 + Se2 - (Se1 SeP: final sensitivity under parallel interpretation; Se1, Se 2: sensitivities of test 1 and test 2. Box 2. How meat inspection can lead to a reduction of a hazard. MI can only lead to a reduction in h azard prevalence if all of the following three criteria are met: The infected/contaminated animal or carcase shows a macroscopic lesion1 o Dependent on biology of pathogen and the animal; The lesion can be detected by a MI task o Dependent on the task itself, the environment (light ing, speed of slaughter line) and the person performing the inspection (experience, training); A corrective action is taken that is effective in lowering the hazard impact o Dependent on legislation and operation manuals, evidence -based judgement of consequences, traditions, awareness. These three criteria each have a probability of being met. The overall ability of a MI task to change hazard prevalence is the product of a ll criteria. If one criterion is not fulfilled (probability p is 0), the product of the three criteria will be 0, i.e. the MI task does not have any effect on the prevalence. To result in a hazard reduction of at least 50 %, all three criteria have to be f ulfilled with a combined probability of at least 50 %. Example: p(criterion 1) * p(criterion 2) * p(criterion 3) = 50 % * 100 % * 100 % = 50 % 1 In the context of this project, macroscopic lesions are those visible to the naked eye and that could be identified under appropriate conditions, e.g. by an experienced pathologist in an appropriate environment 15 In qualitative terms, this means that a range of tests with low Se can end up with a combined moderate or even high Se. In our risk assessment, the within -step probabilities are combined to obtain a final (overall) \"probability of a carcase carrying a hazard/lesion at chilling \". For this purpose, within -step probabilitie s are combined according to the matrix provided in table 7 in Annex 1. MI tasks can reduce the presence of a hazard in the carcase/organ or have no effect . Therefore, w e have not consider ed the possibility that a MI task causes greater contamination of a carcase/organ , except where activities at slaughter can significantly contribute to the carcase/organ contamination (e.g. Salmonella ). In this case the risk pathway includes those steps in the process (both slaughter house activi ties and meat inspection tasks) that are likely to increase the level of contamination of the carcase/organ. In this case, the matrix used to combine probabilities is provided in table 8, annex 1. See section 3 below (model input parameters) for further de tails. 2.5. Risk characterization Risk characterization implies the combination of probability of a hazard occurrence and its consequences . In this project the risk assessment covers only a segment of the food chain (slaughter). The risk model therefore provide s an estimation of the probability of occurrence of a hazard, or a lesion associated with a hazard, at chilling (final point in our assessment). This qualitative estimate obtained from the model is then evaluated in the context of its potential consequence s. The risk for PH is directly evaluated on the basis of the probability that the hazard is present at the chiller, and therefore , it is possible for it to reach the consumer. The consequences were evaluated under the provision that all steps following chilling will not modify the presence of the hazard. A full evaluation of the risk at point of consumption would require the evaluation of the effect that subsequent steps and risk reduction measures after chilling will have on the presence of the hazard i n the food product. In terms of risk to animal health and animal welfare, the presence of the hazard/condition at the chiller is an indicator of the failure to detect/identify the hazard. The consequences are then assessed on two main aspects: impact on ( i) disease notification and (ii) hazard spread. 16 2.5.1. Description of the qualitative categories of likelihood and consequences As described above, risk is characterized by a combination of probability of hazard and its consequences. The qualitative categories of likelihood and consequences used to obtain the final measure of risk are described in table 1 and table 2. The quantitative probabilit y ranges presented in table 1 are proposed by the authors and aim at providing approximate numerical ranges for the qu alitative likelihood categories. These ranges were used to \"translate\" quantitative input values derived from literature, official reports and expert elicitation into qualitative values in a transparent and replicable manner2. The \"interpretation \" of the q ualitative values provided in the tables can be used to interpret the model results. Table 1: Definition of qualitative categories of likelihood with quantitative probability ranges used to convert numerical input data into qualitative probabilities (adapted from [3]). Likelihood category Interpretation Quantitative Probability Negligible May occur only in exceptional circumstances or probability of event is sufficiently low to be ignored <0.1 % Very low Would be very unlikely to occur 0.1 % - < 5 % Low Could occur at some time 5 % - <25 % Moderate Might occur or should occur at some time 25 % - <75 % High Is expected to occur in most circumstances 75 % - 100 % Table 2: Definition of qualitative categories of consequences (adapted from [3]). Consequences Interpretation Insignificant Insignificant impact, little disruption to normal operation* Minor Minor impact for a few individuals , modifications to normal operations necessary, but manageable* Major Major impact for a few or many individuals , systems significantly compromised, increased monitoring required* * In relation to animal welfare : \"operation \" or \"system \" refers to the animal , i.e. animal welfare is compromised or not. In relation to public and animal health : \"operation \" or \"system \" refers to the operator, whole agricultural sector or society as a whole. 2 the qualitative out put of the models cannot be \"re -translated\" directly into numerical ranges but should be interpreted in line with the definitions given in tables 1 and 2 17 2.6. Sensitivity analysis To eval uate the robustness of the model, the scenarios were re -calculated with altered input values for those parameters that seemed to have the highest impact on the final outcome. By changing the input parameters that are related to the quality of MI or the sla ughter process, predictions can be made on how the whole system of slaughter and inspection would react should improvements be introduced at certain steps in the slaughter process. As such, the results of the sensitivity analysis can be used to indicate st eps potentially suitable to maintain an equal level of protection if current MI practices were modified. Alternative scenarios, the values used in the sensitivity analysis and the outcomes are described in the specific results and discussion sections (anne x 3). 2.7. General assumptions For a list of general and specific assumptions see annexes 2 and 3. 3. Model input parameters The likelihood of occurrence of desired (hazard reduction) and undesired (hazard increase) events in the risk pathway depends on multiple risk factors which can be related to MI or not. 3.1. Factors related to MI influencing the prevalence of a hazard Three input parameters are needed: probability of presence of lesion in a body part or organ, probability of detection of this lesion and action taken (see project report N.3, risk pathway , for details). For post-mortem inspection information on these three parameters was collected for every single organ (system) to be inspected, such as whole carcase, head, lungs, gastro -intestinal tract, e tc. (tab. 3). For a detailed list of the body parts and organs to be inspected and the specific MI task see annex 3. 18 Table 3: Factors influencing presence of a hazard in/on a carcase by inspection tasks carried out by official veterinarians (FCI = check of food chain information, AM = ante -mortem , PM = post -mortem, Lab = laboratory testing). Inspection task Factor FCI Probability that presence of hazard is stated in FCI Probability that hazard will be detected with FCI check Corrective action: Probability that animal will be separated (and not be subject to routine slaughter) AM Probability that clinical sign s are present Probability that clinical sign s will be detected during inspection Corrective action: Probability that animal will be separated (and not be subject to routine slaughter) PM Probability that a macroscopic lesion is present in this body part or organ ( -system)* Probability that lesion will be detected* Corrective action: Probability that whole carcase will be condemned* * These three factors are repeatedly entered in the model for every body part or organ ( -system). 3.2. Factors not related to MI influencing the prevalence of a hazard Table 4 provides an overview of factors other than MI tasks that are required to estimate change in hazard/lesion prevalence at the slaughterhouse level. Table 4: Factors influencing the presence of a hazard in/on a carcase in lairage, during the slaughter process and additional factors.

Data collection Data to parameterise the models was collect ed from peer -reviewed literature, official reports and data from national and international organizations. Specific findings presented in report N. 4 of this project were also used to parameterise the models whenever relevant. Missing input parameters were collected through elicitation of expert opinion. National and international experts were recruited for this purpose. The expert elicitation protocol is explained in detail in project report N.4. 20 BACKGROUND INFORMATION FOR SELECTED HAZARDS Mycobacterium b ovis (as an Animal Health Risk) TB due to Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis ) is a contagious, usually chronic disease of cattle, characterized by nodular lesions - granulomas with necrosis, caseation and calcification in lungs, lymph nodes or other organs, including lymph nodes of the intestines. The bacterium is transmitted amon g cattle mainly via aerosols; faeco -oral transmission is important prior to weaning. Preclinical stages of bovine TB can be detected in live animals by the use of tests of cellular immunity, i.e. the skin, gamma - interferon and lymphocyte transformation tes ts [4]. Current MI procedures at the slaughterhouse were introduced detect and control TB [5]. Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (as an Animal Health Risk) Paratuberculosis is a chronic wasting disease of cattle associated with their immune response to MAP infection. The disease can lead to considerable reduction of productivity of cattle [6]. A major problem in the control of this disease is the lack of a reliable diagnostic method to identify animals with subclinical disease [7]. The disease spreads in cattle by ingestion of M. paratuberculosis from the contaminated environment and can persist in a herd after the introduction of infected animals. Infection can spread vertically in-utero or via infected semen . The primary source of infection in calves is milk from infected cows or milk that is contaminate d with the faeces of shedders. MAP can be detected in GO in the form of thickened and corrugated intestinal mucosa and enlarged caecal and mesenteric lymph nodes, often with haemorrhages. Also, the carcase can present with associated oedema and emaciation. Early lesions occur in the walls of the small intestine and the draining mesenteric lymph nodes, and infection is confined to these sites at this stage. As the disease progresses, gross lesions occur in the ileum, jejunum, terminal small intestine, caecum and colon, and in the mesenteric lymph nodes. MAP is present in the lesions and, in the terminal stages, throughout the body [8]. Toxoplasma gondii (as a Public Health risk) Toxoplasmosis is a common, world -wide zoonosis of increasing concern which is responsible for major economic losses in livestock, and especially in sheep, through abortions, still birth and neonatal losses [9]. Other symptoms in sheep include fever, 21 generalized tremor and difficult breathing [10]. On post-mortem , the disease can present with multiple granulomatous lesions in lungs, necrosis in the liver, spleen and kidneys, ascites, hydrothorax and intestinal ulceration [10]. Toxoplasmosis parasite Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii ). The definitive hosts of the parasite are the domestic cat and other felines; human s, as an intermediate host , can be infected either through the consumption of undercooked meat contaminated with cysts of this protozoa (bradyzoites) or by the ingestion of oocysts (shed by infected cats) in contaminated food and water. Although it is assumed that roughly 500 mill ion people have been infected with T. gondii at some point in their life [11], infection with T. gondi i is normally chronic but largely asymptomatic in humans. In about 15 % of cases a febrile illness with lymphadenopathy is present [12]. However, it may cause stillbirth, blindness, mental retardation and occasional death of congeni tally infected infants [13]. More sever e and complicated disease may occur in immune -compromised patients, including those infected with the human immunodeficiency virus and those receiving immuno -suppressive chemotherapy following neoplastic disease or organ transplant ation [14]. Salmonella (as a Public Health risk) Salmonellosis is a risk to PH through contaminated food and the environment [15]. In 2009 in the UK there were 10,071 laboratory confirmed human cases of salmonellosis [16]. However, considering the known under -reporting, the total number of ca ses in 2009 could be as high as 40,000 [17]. Salmonella Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium account for 60 -80% of all human Salmonellosis. S. Typhimur ium is isolated from all domestic livestock. Over the past five years this serovar was the most commonly found serovar in pigs and accounted for approximately 70 % of all food related incidents [18]. Yet, the magnitude of the contribution of pork consumption to human disease with S. Typhimurium is difficult to quantify [19]. The observed prevalence of slaughter pigs infected with Salmonella spp. in the UK was 21.2 % (17.8 % - 25 %) [20]. Infection with Salmonella is very rarely associated with clinical disease in pigs [21]. Only young pigs up to four months are likely to develop severe clinical signs such as septicaemia, high fever and death [21]. Infected pigs may become carriers and excrete Salmonella in their faeces intermittently. Carriers of S. Typhimurium may develop septicaemia or enteritis if their resistance is 22 lowered by environmental stresses (e.g. as pigs are loaded and transported to the abattoir) or due to concurrent infections [20, 21]. The colon is usually the primary organ showing lesions related to S. Typhimurium infection, presenting either focal or diffuse necrotizing colitis [21]. These lesions are po tentially detectable by inspection of the GO. Presence of Salmonella infection does not necessarily result in carcase contamination, unless faecal spillage occurs from the anus or a damaged gut. Poor hygiene in a slaughterhouse may result in cross -contamin ation between clean and contaminated carcases. Classical Swine Fever ( as an Animal Health Risk) CSF is a serious and contagious viral disease of pigs and wild boar with a widespread worldwide distribution. CSF was eradicated from Great Britain in 1966. Since then outbreaks occurred in 1971 and 1986. A more serious epidemic in East Anglia in 2000 affected 16 farms [22-24]. An outbreak of th is notifiable disease can cause serious economic losses as a result of export limitations and mass destruction. Infected herds cannot be treated but must be culled. Clinical symptoms that can frequently be seen are high fever, gastro -intestinal and respira tory signs, dullness/apathy, widespread petechiae and ecchymoses, neurological symptoms, hunched -up back and huddling [25]. The CSF virus together with secondary bacterial infections, can cause lesions in multiple organ systems, including haemorrhagic and enlarged lymph nodes, ascites, petechial haemorrhages, hyperaemic intestinal tract, oedema of mesocolon among others [26]. Clinical diagnosis continues to pose problems for veterinary practitioners as moderate strains often cause only subclinical or mild symptoms [27, 28]. Furthermore, an extensive list of differential diagnosis exists (African Swine Fever, Aujeszky's disease, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome, porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome, all forms of bacterial septicaemia and pathogens causin g haemorrhages, intoxication, etc.) [25]. To date, no active surv eillance programme is in place in the UK for CSF (Animal Health, pers. comm.). Detection of a positive animal at the slaughterhouse would have severe effects on further slaughter processes [29]. 23 Abdominal and inguinal hernia ( as an Animal welfare risk) Abdominal (umbilical) and inguinal (scrotal) hernias are relatively common genetic defects in pigs [30, 31] . The prevalence of hernia varies between 0.4 % to 6.7 %, depending on breed and environment [30-33]. Direct contact of herniated intestines with skin can cause partial bowel obstruction with subsequent poor growth performance [30, 31, 34]. Hernias can expand to melon size; larger hernias usually result in complications; loops of bowel tend to rupture or leak, resulting in peritonitis, etc. [31]. This results in the production of thick scar tissue and adhesions between abdominal organs, hindering the evisceration process. It was reported that over 50 % of pigs with large hernias will be condemned for peritonitis [31]. Besides the economical loss due to rejected carcases, the extra labour required during the slaughter process needs to be considered [31, 34]. Larger hernias are considered a welfare issue, due to the tendency of the hernia sac to get infected, injured and/or abscessed. Mortality rates are reported to be higher and growth rates slower in finisher pig s with abdominal or inguinal hernia, compared to unaffected pigs [34]. Genetic traits are described to have an effect on the musculature of the navel and may therefore impact on hernia predisposition. However, proper hygiene and management of piglets (e.g. correct placing of navel clips at farrowing) is suggested to be more likely to reduce the incidence of umbilical hernias than special breeding selection [31, 34]. Tail biting ( as an Animal Welfare Risk) Tail biting is an important welfare issue and can considerably compromise the well - being of pigs. Tail biting has been linked to a range of pathological effects, from injury of the tail to pyaemia an d abscesses in different parts of the body. Such effects may be associated with a reduced growth rate or, in more severe cases, total carcase condemnation. Even mild tail damage, restricted to puncture wounds, can cause pyaemia [35]. Tail biting is described as being the most common cause of secondary bacterial spread in pigs and subsequently increases the risk of carcases being rejected due to abscessation [36]. Estimates of tail bite lesion prevalence in the UK vary from 0.19 % to 6.9 % [37-39]. 24 There is no reference to the presence of abscesses in GO as a result of tail biting in the literature . Besides abscessation in the tail and the spine, infection may reach the lungs. Rarely, other organs such as kidney, heart, liver, umbilicus, head and peritoneum are affected [36, 39]. Various factors can predispose to tail biting, e.g. hunger, lack of facilities such as bedding, early weaning, high stock densities, insufficient trough space, high temperatures, insufficient ventilation, very bright light, and observing other pigs tail biting [39]. 25 MAIN FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS (BY HAZARD) Main results are presented for each hazard in annex 3, together with the results of the sensitivity analysis and a discussion of the findings. The main conclusions are summarised in th is section. A general discussion of the resu lts follows in a separate section (general discussion). Table 5 presents a summary of the main results by hazard. Table 5: Summary of the qualitative estimates for the three green offal inspection scenarios produced with the risk m odel: what proportion of carcases with lesions in their green offal will be detected at green offal inspection : AH = Animal Health, AW = Animal Welfare, PH = Public Health, GO = green offal, M. bovis CSF = Classical Swine Fever in a situation with a \"single pig\" or a \"group\" of infected pigs in lairage. Proportion detected Hazard Risk aspect Traditional GO inspection (scenario 1) Visual GO inspection (scenario 2) Absence of GO inspection (scenario 3) M. bovis AH Very low Negligible Negligible MAP AH Low Low Negligible T. gondii PH Negligible -* Negligible Salmonella PH Low Low Negligible CSF (single pig) AH Low Low Negligible CSF (group) AH Moderate Moderate Negligible Hernia AW High High Negligible Tail bite AW Negligible Negligible Negligible * T. gondii was assessed for sheep. In small ruminants visual inspection is already in place, i.e. traditional GO inspection = visual inspection. Mycobacterium bovis The consequences of M. bovis not being detected during meat inspection at the slaughterhouse, from an animal health perspective, are of two main types: (i) presence of the hazard at chiller may allow for potential silent spread of th e pathogen and (ii) lack of reporting to authorities and farmers with its consequences for disease monitoring and control in the country. The risk assessment for the current MI system predicts a negligible proportion of TB - positive carcases to be undetecte d and present at chilling. This translates into high protection of animal health, by preventing silent spread of the pathogen and 26 providing the opportunity to detect and report findings to farmers and authorities the appropriate measures to be taken. The r isk does not change significantly when GO inspection is limited to visual inspection or even when GO inspection is not conducted, although the model highlights that current GO inspection is in a better position to detect TB associated lesions in GOs compar ed to visual inspection only. This finding can be explained by the fact that TB lesions are more common in other organs such as lymph nodes and easier to detect by inspection of the head or lungs. These MI activities greatest contribution is in the protect ion of AH from the risk of M. bovis spread. In conclusion, variations in GO inspection as modelled in this project do not have any implication s for Animal health risk associated with M. bovis . Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis Visual inspection of GO was found to be an important step in MI for identification of MAP positive carcases, demonstrating the same effectiveness as the current GO inspection system that requires palpation and incision in addition to visual inspection . Both systems will allow for identification and consequent reporting of disease. Visual inspection is therefore a valuable contributor in identifying MAP at the slaughterhouse . It follows from this finding that not performi ng GO inspection (scenario 3) c ould r esult in a great increase in animal health risk derived from this hazard (i.e. not detection/reporting and potential for silent spread). Nevertheless, our model predicts a very low probability of carcases carrying the hazard at the chiller even when GO ins pection is not performed. The consequent possibility of silent spread of the pathogen to the livestock population is therefore limited with any of the GO inspection scenarios modelled. This is in part due to the very low prevalence assumed in the model , however, the sensitivity analysis revealed that the model outputs are not greatly influenced by the disease prevalence. Moreover, whole carcase inspection was effective at detecting MAP. It is sensible to deduc e that this step will help minimise the number o f animals undetected at inspection and therefore contribute to the protect ion of animal health if GO inspection is removed . In conclusion, modification or even elimination of GO inspection would not necessarily result in an increased AH risk provided that other steps of the meat inspection process (mainly whole carcase inspection and ante -mortem) are accurately performed . This is particularly important as monitoring at the farm level is not conducted. 27 Toxoplasma gondii The current GO inspection procedure (visual inspection) does not seem to have a great effect in reducing the PH risk associated with Toxoplasma gondii . In general, meat inspection at the slaughterhouse is not very efficient in detecting toxoplasma positive animals. Our model predicts a moderate probability of having infected carcases at the chiller, with its consequent risk for public health. This is even more notabl e considering the relatively high prevalence of the disease in small ruminants in this count ry. The results of the sensitivity analysis, using a lower initial value of T. gondii prevalence in sheep did not affect the ability of GO inspection to detect the hazard but decrease d the proportion of undected carcases contaminated with the hazard in the chiller. This suggests that control measures at the farm to reduce prevalence in the sheep flock may be important when reducing the risk for public health. The consequences of toxoplasmosis infection in humans are of particular relevance to certain high -risk groups (mainly pregnant women and immune -compromised individuals). Given the moderate likelihood of the hazard being present in meat after inspection and the serious consequences, our risk estimation (considering both likelihood and consequence) cann ot be lower than moderate. Nevertheless, the steps that follow the slaughter process, and particularly cooking and consumption patterns, are crucial in protecting consumers from the very serious consequences of this hazard. Efforts to reduce the PH risk fr om T. gondii in further steps along the food chain should aim at the destruction of the cysts through cooking or other ways of processing. These strategies have proven, to date, to be able to reduce the risk to an important degree. Another successful strat egy to reduce the risk to public health would be the reduction of disease prevalence in the sheep flock. In addition, categorization of farms according to disease status could be used as a mechanism to decide whether meat is to be sold as fresh or used for the production of meat derived products [40]. Salmonella The slaughter process is a crucial step in the spread of Salmonella and the resulting PH impact. The slaughter activities determine significantly the degree to which carcases will be contaminated at the end of the line. The MI process, as such, contributes to a much more limited degree (very few MI tasks will detect the v isual 28 conditions associated with Salmonella ). This is the case for GO inspection, given that the most characteristic condition associated with Salmonella is enteritis. GO inspection can only lead to an effective change of prevalence of Salmonella in carca ses at chilling if a) a visible condition is present on the carcase/organ which is b) detected and c) a corrective action is taken. In the case of Salmonella the probabilities of a carcase/organ showing a lesion and being condemned are both very low . As a result, there are not major differences among the three GO inspection practices, even if the traditional GO inspection (scenario 1) has a high detection rate and without GO inspection (scenario 3) the detection rate is negligible (see fig. 2). In summary, missing a low number of lesions in the gastrointestinal tract as a consequence of not performing GO inspection or performing only visual inspection does not influence the overall probability of having Salmonella -positive carcases at the point of chilling. Therefore, a change of GO inspection does not seem to modify the risk for PH associated with this pathogen. Salmonella is one of the most prevalent foodborne pathogens in the UK and an important Public Health hazard. It affects a large number of individua ls every year causing serious threat to some patients. The economic consequences derived from the high number of cases are also of significan ce. It is accepted that the slaughter process is a crucial step in controlling the contamination of meat. However, control strategies applied in the remaining steps of the food chain can contribute significantly to reduc ing the risk to public health posed by this pathogen. Classical Swine Fever The results of our risk model indicate that infected animals can be to great extent detected with ante- and post-mortem inspection. The contribution of GO to the detection of CSF is great, as lesions are usually present in those organs. Nevertheless, the impact of GO inspection on the probability of having CSF positive carcase s in the chiller does not change for the different scenarios, as the probability of CSF positive carcases (or a carcase with CSF related lesions) immediately before GO inspection was already very low in all three GO scenarios . As a consequence the final proportion of CSF -positive carcases in the chiller does not change substantially, whether or not GO is inspected. This may be due to the fact that most infected animals with lesions show pathology in various organs other than GO and therefore are likely to be detected with other MI tasks early on in the inspection process. So GO, although 29 being effective in the identification of the hazard , has only a limited impact in protecting AH in relation to CSF. As described in previous ch apters, two different types of risk have to be differentiated in the context of AH. First, if a CSF -positive carcase does not lead to disease suspicion and consequent reporting, no disease control measures will be started and CSF can silently spread to mor e farms before being detected. It is clear from our results that the Se of the MI as a \"diagnostic system\" is dependent on the number of pigs that show lesions, as can be seen by the difference in detection between a single pig and a group of infected pigs . The more pigs with clinical signs or pathological abnormalities, the greater the anticipated capacity of the MI system to detect CSF. The question remains if, after a carcase is rejected, samples will be submitted for further laboratory investigation to confirm or rule out CSF. Between 2008 and 2010 less than five CSF suspicions per year were raised in UK abattoirs (Animal Health, pers. comm.). Another risk to AH exist if only macroscopic lesions are trimmed from a carcase or its organs and the re st of th e carcase enters the food chain. Even if EU legislation forbids feeding of swill, illegal activities or lack of awareness pose a residual risk to the pig population of this country. In both situations above - missing lesions or missing infected carcases - the consequences are severe, as an outbreak of CSF will not only have serious implications for infected premises and pig production units in the surrounding area, but for the whole UK pig industry. Abdominal and inguinal hernia The contribution of MI task s to the identification of hernias is high. GO inspection shows a good capacity to detect hernias, as do many other MI steps such as antemortem and peritoneum inspection. This demonstrates that MI is a valuable tool in the identification of this AW concern . In general, the prevalence of abdominal and umbilical hernias was assumed to be very low . As lesions associated with hernia will be detected with a high probability during visual inspection of the whole carcase and the peritoneum, the contribution of GO inspection, irrespective of scenario and detection probability, does not change the final negligible prevalence of having lesions in the carcase at point of chilling. Protection of AW requires both the identification and subsequent reporting of the findi ng. The literature and other consulted sources, stated that there are reasons to 30 believe that gross pathologies associated with hernia are sometimes not identified as hernias (consulted experts, personal communication) . In this situation, the impact of MI on the protection of AW is questionable, despite MI providing a very suitable system for hernia identification. We found that changes in the GO inspection system will not result in a different probability of detecting hernias. This is due to the fact that, although GO inspection provides an opportunity to identify hernias, other steps exist in the inspection system where hernias are detected . As a consequence, reducing GO inspection to visual or even not performing it will not have a major effect on AW. Tail biting GO inspection has very limited contribution to the detection of tail biting in pigs. Modification to this inspection step will not influence the AW risk. Inspection at the slaughtherhouse as a whole is of value to the identification of this condition. Nevertheless, as with other AW concerns, the point of interest is whether findings are then reported . This is the mechanism that ultimately impacts on AW. It could be concluded that, the probability of detecting tail biting during inspection at the slaughterhouse is high, but it is also relatively unlikely that lesions associated with this AW concern will be misdiagnosed , reducing the final probability that the problem is reported and action taken. The impact of this is even bigger if those missed (or not reported) cases show a severe form, e.g. partial or total loss of the tail or abscessation [54], conditions that can significantly compromise the well -being of pigs. 31 GENERAL DISCUSSION The application of risk models at abattoir level creates the opportunity to compare the outcome of different scenarios. By changing single inpu t parameters the most influential steps in the risk pathway contributing to the outcome can be identified. But in recent risk assessments MI was not considered as a hazard reduction step [55], and it is often neglected [46], or even treated as another source o f cross - contamination [47]. The model described here may compliment other risk assessments of hazards related to meat production so that risk estimation at abattoir level can be undertaken in a consistent and transparent manner. The risk assessment for the three different inspection scenarios for ruminants showed that the curren t GO inspection regime is of very limited significance for bovine TB, MAP and toxoplasmosis. Results indicate that removal of this specific MI task would not make a substantial difference in the detection of these hazards and the subsequent risk to AH and PH, respectively. Similarly, for hazards in pigs (Salmonella , CSF, hernia, tail bites) the model indicated no change in the probability of a carcase carrying a hazard or lesion if the GO inspection is performed in any of the alternative GO scenarios. The r elative contribution of GO inspection was also found to be limited because lesions manifested in GO alone are rare and therefore there would be a high probability of detecting lesions indicative of hazards by other MI tasks. The importance of abattoirs as points of (early) detection of AH related conditions is widely accepted. MI offers the unique possibility to link pathological findings to conditions recorded during ante-mortem . However, the extent to which the slaughterhouse allows for efficient monitor ing is not the same for all animal diseases. Our results suggest no difference in risk for CSF, MAP and T. gondii regardless of whether certain MI tasks are carried out or not. A third important purpose of MI is the identification of welfare issues in liv e/dead animals and carcases, which appear to have been caused on the farm of origin or during transport (Manual for Official Controls, Food Standards Agency). A range of conditions that compromise the animal's welfare can be detected in the lairage and lesions can be seen during the inspection of carcase and offal. The examples included in this report are hernia and tail bites in pigs for all of which GO inspection did not seemed to be a critical detection point. 32 The model was applied to two PH hazards (Salmonella spp. and T. gondii ). In terms of PH, the consequences of hazards not detected at meat inspection can only be estimated incompletely as intermediate steps between slaughterhouse and consumer have not been analyzed in this project. Attempting to mak e conclusions about the PH risk associated with these hazards by looking at the results of our model will be incorrect and produce misleading conclusions. Therefore in the discussion of our individual results the PH risk is indicated assuming that the prev alence of the hazard does not change along the remaining food processing/consumption steps. Our results further highlighted the inter -dependency of the presence of a lesion , its detection and the corrective action triggered by this finding. Even the most effective MI task (detecti ng all macroscopic lesions) will not lead to a successful reduction if a hazard rarely produces lesions or if no action is taken after lesions are detected. In the context of AH and AW, th e value of detection depends largely on the quality and completeness of the communication of findings during meat inspection and the degree of follow -up and the correcti ve actions taken . Model constraints due to input data quality Due to a lack of information, several simplifying assumptions had to be made in order to develop this model. To address this, a sensitivity analysis was undertaken whenever background information for an input value was not available at all or different dat a sources did not provide consistent estimates. By changing the input parameters that are related to the quality of MI or the slaughter process, predictions can be made on the overall effect of the whole system of slaughter and inspection when improvements are made a t certain steps in the slaughter process. As such, the results of the sensitivity analysis identify steps that could be altered in order to maintain the current level of protection inspite of other changes to MI practices. If in the future this risk model were to be used for hazards of less public and scientific interest (e.g. as c ompared to M. bovis or Salmonella ) even more input parameters may have to be based on expert opinion as oppposed to imperical data . 33 Lack of data in the context of the specific hazards M. bovis : For most hazards, the literature tends to report the overall proportion of animals found with lesions. No further distinction is made if these lesions were solely found in one or in several body parts or organs and whether the hazard was already suspected during ante-mortem inspection. MAP and T. gondii : An important data gap in relation to these two hazards was the lack of information on how many carcases are truly MAP or T. gondii -positive, as laboratory testing is not performed routinely if lesions are detected at the slaughterhouse. Salmonella : Uncertainty remains on whether a relationship exists between the extent of cross -contaminated and the prevalence of Salmonella shedding animals. Furthermore, the suggested reported impact of different slaughter processes on the prev alence of Salmonella as measured by carcase swabs varies. A third difficulty is the between -batch variation in Salmonella prevalence at point of arrival at the lairage. CSF has not been present in the UK for more than ten years. Therefore, estimates of the probability that lesions would be detected are highly uncertain. The low number of submissions to rule out CSF in the last three years (Animal health, pers. comm.) indicates that CSF is suspected very rarely in slaughterhouses and disease awareness is low. Tail bites and hernia: For these AW -related hazards, the figures for prevalence presented in scientific studies, reports and expert elicitation were in general considerably higher compared to the figures obtain ed from records of rejection data provided by the Food Standards Agency. This introduces uncertainty in the quantification of the risk by the model. 34 CONCLUSIONS The most important limitations of the current MI system are related to its inability to detect hazards that are not detectable by senso ry means ( i.e. visible inpection , palpable) as hazards either: o do not produce lesions (or not in slaughter -age animals ) or o the lesions are present below the visible or palpable detection limit of the meat inspector. In the context of the seven hazards e abdominal and inguinal hernia and tail biting), the current GO inspection regime contributes to a limited degree to the detection of these hazards and the subsequent reduction in risk to PH, AH and AW. Even though the contribution of GO inspection to reducing the amount of carcases carrying hazards/lesions at chilling seems to be limited, GO inspection can provide valuable information with regard to AH and AW related hazards. In order to obtain a more accurate estimate of the PH risk associated with specific hazards, further steps of the food chain should be included in the risk pathway and modelled accordingly. Recommendations for further research In this project a qualitat ive risk assessment has been developed and applied to a number of hazards. Qualitative estimates do not represent standard measurements, but give a relative appreciation of an input/outcome value. To obtain a more specific estimate of risk it would be valu able to undertake a quantitative risk assessment. This would also contribute to the validation of the findings presented in this report. However , robust , accurate and sufficiently detailed data needed for such models are often not available. Resources shou ld be allocated to improve the quality and amount of available data. 35 Observation studies could be undertaken to assess quantitatively the degree to which specific slaughter processes increase or decrease the probability of a carcase carrying a hazard. Thes e findings will be especially important for hazards that can be amplified at the slaughterhouse , e.g. cross -contamination with Salmonella . It would be valuable to obtain more precise estimates of the current detection rates of various lesion/conditions at the slaughterhouse by the different MI tasks, both at ante -mortem and post -mortem inspection. Routine monitoring of these findings is available , however , the quality of the recording often limits the use of th ese data. Rejection records should be made more specific and include information on the type of lesion/condition detected and possibly on the MI task that facilitated its detection. Experimental studies could also be conducted to obtain this type of information. Experimental studies aimed at evaluatin g the effect of modifi ying the current GO inspection procedures should be undertaken to confirm the findings of this project. Finally, for a more holistic and comprehensive risk evaluation, a full \"farm to fork\" assessment is needed. This would allow obtai ning a more accurate measure of risk accounting for the impact that other practices along the food production chain have on the prevalence of hazards and their consequences for PH, AH and AW. The risk model developed as part of this project could be expand ed for this purpose. 36 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors wish to thank the Food Standards Agency for commissioning this research.

European Legislation Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of t he European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption. 41 ANNEX Annex 1 Combination of qualitative risk categories along the risk pathway Annex 2 General model assumptions Annex 3 Results and discussion by hazard Annex 4 Model assumptions, input data, data sources and data gaps Annex 5 Meat inspection tasks according to Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 42 Annex 1 - Combina tion of qualitative risk categories along the risk pathway Models attempt to describe the real situation in a simplified way by identifying and characterizing generic rules for the way events are interlinked. Such events can be either dependent on (condit ional) or non-dependent from each other. Example for dependent events: a lesion can only be detected with a MI task if the lesion is present in the respective organ. Example for independent events: cross -contamination of pig carcases with Salmonella may happen during the dehairing process whether or not the prevalence of bacteria on the carcase surface was reduced by scalding. In this model the following two rules apply: Within a step probabilities are dependent; Between steps probabilities are non -dependent. A graphic representation of the model is given in figure 2. Combination of qualitative risk categories of dependent steps Within every step a number of probabilities are to be combined. Table 14 provides the matrix applied to combine likelihood categories of dependent steps. Example: The probability of a carcase being rejected depends on three probabilities: Probability that a lesion is present in an organ (e.g. moderate ); Probability that this lesion will be detected with the specifi c MI task (e.g. high); Probability that a corrective action is taken (e.g. very low ). The combined probability of rejection will be: (moderate * high = moderate ) * very low = very low 43 Table 6: Combination matrix used to evaluate the likelihood if the subsequent event 2 depends on the previous event 1. Event 1 Event 2 Negligible Very low Low Moderate High Negligible Negligible Negligible Negligible Negligible Negligible Very low Negligible Negligible Very low Very low Very low Low Negligible Very low Very low Low Low Moderate Negligible Very low Low Low Moderate High Negligible Very low Low Moderate High Combination of qualitative risk categories of non -dependent steps The main steps of the risk pathway (as laid out in figure 1) are understood to have an effect on the prevalence of hazard/lesion which is not dependent on the previous or subsequent step s. Table 14 and table 15 provide the matrix applied to combine likelihood categories of non-dependent steps. Thes e steps can affect the probability in two possible directions: Reduc e the prevalence of the hazard/lesion Increase the prevalence of the hazard/lesion If a step is successful in reducing the prevalence this \"change( -)\" will be \"subtracted\" from the prevalence prior to the step (tab. 14). If a step increases the prevalence this \"change(+)\" will be \"added\" to the prevalence correspondingly (tab. 15). Example: Assumed that the surface preval ence of Salmonella in pigs was moderate before scalding and scalding is able to reduce the prevalence to a high degree, then the combination of prevalence and change( -) is: moderate - high = low 44 Table 7: Change( -): combination matrix of non -dependent events used to evaluate the likelihood when the subsequent event (2) leads to a decrease in prevalence of the hazard/lesion in relation to the previous event (1).

General model assumptions It is assumed that all criteria, as laid out in relevant legislation, are accomplished by the slaughterhouse operator and staff; Slaughter takes place in slaughterhouses with automated processes and with a single slaughter line (risk related to manual slaughter are not considered); All animals are of typical slaughter age and show, for each hazard, lesions typical for animals of this age. Typical slaughter ages for the UK are: o Cattle: 18 months to 4 years (67 % of cattle) [56, 57]; o Sheep: 6 months to 1.5 years (84 % of sheep) [58]; o Pigs: 5 - 6 months (>80 % of pigs) [59]. The risk pathway focuses on animals (and carcases) whi ch are subject ed to routine slaughter. Animals that are separated at the stage of FCI check or ante- mortem inspection or animals that have to undergo emergency slaughter are not included as we assume that a range of additional and more targeted inspection tasks are applied to these animals. This handling and attention is deemed not to be representative for the majority of animals inspected at slaughter; Only obligatory MI tasks are included in this pathway (as listed in annex 3). Cross -contamination in the slaughter hall (e.g. due to splashing, physical contact between two carcases, insufficient cleaning and disinfection of the slaughter hall after the end of the slaughter process) is not a stand -alone step in the risk pathway, but is integrated in every mo delled slaughter and inspection step; Transmission of AH hazards among animals at lairage is ignored as the time period spent in lairage is generally short. With regard to PH, with the example of Salmonella , cross -contamination is modelled; thereby initial ly hazard -free animals can become hazard carriers. 46 Annex 3. R esults and discussion by hazard Mycobacterium bovis M. bovis in cattle is considered in the context of this work as an AH hazard. Our assessment has the ultimate aim of evaluating two aspects of risk posed to cattle health by this hazard in the context of different GO inspection scenarios: 1. whether the capability o f detecting lesions is different among the different GO inspection scenarios. 2. whether the proportion of undetected TB -positive carcases in the chilling room differs for different GO inspection strategies . Annex 4, table 17 list s the main steps consider in the risk assessment model for this pathogen, the input data, sources and data gaps. Results Lairage : Prevalence of M. bovis in cattle in the UK was assumed to be 0.5 % [16]. The model focuses only on TB non -reactors (a fraction of the infected animals), since reactors must undergo separated slaughter with enhanced post-mortem inspection, which , if considered, would bias the results of the risk assessment as laid out in our model. The actual proportion of non -reactors showing clinical signs of disease in the UK (low grade fever, chronic intermittent hacking cough, difficult breathing, emaciation , etc.) is considered to be low, and the model predicts that a very low proportion of infected non -reactors can be detected before slaughter ( ante-mortem inspection). This is in line with the fact that symptoms of clinical disease, even if present, are not pathognomonic (see annex 4, table 17), what makes identification of infected animals more difficult. Post -mortem inspection : Animals can have characteristic TB lesions in various organs, but these are primarily present in the lymph nodes of the lungs (mediastinal and bronchial) and head (mainly retropharyngeal). The proportion of infected animals with TB lesions in bronchial, mediastinal or retropharyngeal lymph nodes was considered moderate according to the data sources consulted, with a high probability of detecting the lesions in bronchial or retropharyngeal inspection, and high for inspection of mediastinal lymph nodes (tab . 9) with the current MI , i.e. with 47 incision of corresponding lymph nodes. The final probability that lesions will be detected in the lungs or head is moderate . After slaughtering, carcase dressing and all MI procedures have been performed, the carcase is placed in a chilling room. Based on rejection data provided by the Food Standards Agency the proportion of carcases of infected animals at chiller is believed to be very low . Considering this, together with low probability the model predicts that a negli gible proportion of carcases of infected animals showing lesions only in GO will be present at chilling (for each of the three scenarios). Green offal inspection and alternative scenarios : In cattle older than six weeks (the subject of this project), inspe ction of GO mandates visual inspection of all GO with palpation and, if necessary, incision of the gastric and mesenteric lymph nodes. The probability of a TB infected animal showing lesions in GO (TB granuloma in the lymph nodes) is very low ; the probabil ities that th ese lesions are detected, if present, by 1) current GO inspection, by 2) visual only and 3) without GO inspection were compared. The probabilitiess for the three scenarios were very low (scenario 1) and negligible (scenario 2 and 3), respectively (tab. 9). Table 9.

The probability that lesions present in an infected animal will be detected remained the same for current and only visual GO inspection, i.e. very l ow 48 vs. negligible , but the total proportion of carcases carrying the hazard at chiller was higher. Discussion The probability that an infected animal shows clinical signs of M. Bovis was low; it is not surpris ing that our model indicate d that a very low proportion of infected animals will be detected before slaughter, i.e. during ante-mortem inspection. Furthermore, the fact that those signs are not pathognomonic suggests that a large majority of infected non -rectors will pass ante-mortem inspection undetected. Post- mortem inspection is therefore the most effective way of detecting this AH hazard at the abattoir (followed by diagnostic test confirmation). There were differences in the capacity of detection of M. bovis lesions in the three different GO inspection scenarios. However, the three scenarios will result in a negligible probability that a carcase in the chilling room will carry M. bovis . This suggests that the risk to cattle health as a consequence of this hazard is unlikely to change if GO inspection was modified. It is important to note that, for TB infected animals, when lesions are present in GO it is very likely that lesions will also be present in other organ systems. Furthermore, there is a moderate probability that lesions are present in either lymph nodes of the head or lungs, locations for which the current MI tasks seem to have a great efficiency of detection. In terms of a risk to AH, it is sufficient that TB lesions are detected in one organ for further actions to be pu t in place. The presence of TB lesions in several organs would be of greater importance in a risk assessment of M. bovis as a PH hazard. This emphasize s the current requirement to inspect all body parts and organs before the decision is taken if a carcase is fit for human consumption. Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis MAP in cattle is assessed as an AH hazard. This assessment has the ultimate aim of evaluating two aspects of risk for the health of bovines in the context of different GO inspection scenarios: 1. whether the capability of detecting lesions is different for different scenarios of GO inspection. 49 2. whether the probability of having carcases infected with MAP is different for different GO inspection scenarios Annex 4, table 18 list the mai n steps consider in the risk assessment model for this pathogen, the input data, sources and data gaps. Results Lairage : On the basis of a study conducted in south -west England [40] we assumed a prevalence of MAP in adult cattle in the UK of 3.5 %. The proportion of infected animals showi ng clinical signs of disease (chronic weight loss, emaciation, diarrhoea, debility, etc.) at lairage is considered to be very low and, as a result, our model predicts that a very low proportion of infected animals will be detected before slaughter, i.e. on the basis of clinical signs. Post -mortem inspection : lesions associated with this hazard are very often exclusively present in GO. On occasions, lesions may be found on the dressed carcase and its external surfaces in the form of emaciation and the muscle pits on pressure [41]. However, the capacity of the inspection system to detect those conditions in infected animals was considered low. With an initial prevalence of 3.5 %, a moderate probability that an infected animal will show lesions and the low detection probabilities (for ante-mortem inspectio n, carcase and GO inspection ), the final probability of a carcase carrying lesions at point of chilling is estimated to be very low for all three GO inspection scenarios. This finding cannot be checked against official reports in the country, given that su bmission of samples for testing is not routinely performed for MAP . Green offal inspection and alternative scenarios : In cattle within the considered age category, GO inspection consists of visual inspection (with palpation and, if necessary, incision) of gastric and mesenteric lymph nodes. With the probability of infected animals showing lesions in GO (thickened and corrugated intestinal mucosa and enlarged caecal lymph nodes) being moderate , and the probabilities of detection of each GO inspection scenari o being moderate for current and visual inspection and negligible for absence of GO inspection, this results in a low overall capacity of detection of infected animals for the current and visual GO inspection, and negligible if GO inspection is not conduct ed (tab. 10 ). 50 Table 10.

This indicates that the results of the model are not dependent on prevalence of infection. Discussion Our model indicates that only a very low proportion of infected animals can be detected before slaughter, i.e. ante-mortem inspection. The fact that that clinical signs in infected animals are not specific for parat uberculosis suggests that the vast majority of infected animals will pass ante-mortem inspection undetected as MAP. Since laboratory testing is not performed routinely, post-mortem inspection is the only way of detecting this disease in the abattoir. Our f indings indicate that GO inspection (primarily intestines) is the most important task in detecting this hazard. The comparison of the probability that MAP lesions will be detected within each of the three scenarios, i.e. low, low and negligible (see tab. 10), indicates the current GO inspection is a significant step in detecting this hazard, but given that only visual inspection provides the same level of \"protection\" it can be questioned the degree to which incision and palpation contribute to hazard dete ction. 51 Toxoplasma gondii T. gondii in sheep is assessed as a PH hazard. Our risk assessment has the ultimate aim of evaluating: 1. Whether different GO inspection scenarios have a different capacity to detect the hazard. 2. Whether the consumer's exposure to T. gondii is greater if GO inspection is not performed in slaughtered sheep. Annex 4, table 19 list the main steps consider in the risk assessment model for this pathogen, the input data, sources and data gaps. Results Lairage : Seroprevalence of T. gondii in sheep in the UK was estimated to be 48.6 % in 2009 [16]. The proportion of infected animals showing clinical signs of disease (difficulties of breathing, fever, tremor, etc.) is very low , and this model predicts that a negligible proportion of infected sheep can be detected during ante-mortem inspection. This relates to the fact that these signs are not specific for toxoplasmosis. Post -mortem inspection : Infected animals can show lesions (mostly necrosis) in various locations, such as the lungs, heart, liver, kidneys and the carcase. Nevertheless, the probabili ty of an animal showing clinical signs, and specifically these lesions, is very low . Lesions are more likely in the liver ( low). In other organs a very low or negligible proportion of all lesions will be detected (tab. 11). This suggests that post -mortem i nspection has a limited role in detecting toxoplasma infected animals. Green offal inspection and alternative scenarios : In small ruminants, mandatory inspection of GO implies only visual inspection, therefore only two scenarios were modelled: scenario 1 ( traditional GO inspection) and scenario 3 (absence of GO inspection). Animals do not tend to show lesions in GO (probability that an infected animal shows lesions in GO, such as intestinal ulceration and changes in mesenteric lymph nodes, is negligible) . As a consequence, none of the modelled GO scenarios is of relevance for detecting infected animals. 52 Table 11.

Sensitivity analysis An alternative model was created with a different initial prevalence of infection in sheep (1 %). The final result on probability that present lesions will be detected by current inspection of GO remained negligible . Discussion With a very low probability that an infected animal shows clinical signs of disease, our model indicates that a negligible proportion of infected animals will be detected before slaughter, i.e. ante-mortem inspection. Furthermore, the fact that those signs are not specific for toxop lasmosis indicates that infected animals are very likely to pass ante-mortem inspection undetected. Since laboratory testing is not performed routinely, post-mortem inspection is the only option for detecting this disease even if it is ineffective . GO ins pection seems to have a low ability to detect T. gondii . This is mainly due to the fact that infected animals are very unlikely to show clinical signs in these organs. Moreover the lesions, if present, are rather unspecific and therefore unlikely to be associated with T. gondii by the person performing the inspection. The same applies 53 to other organs, resulting always in low, very low or negligible probabilities of detection (see tab. 11). Submission of samples from suspect animals does not take place rout inely (VLA, pers. comm.); therefore presence of the hazard in the animal's tissues, including meat, cannot be estimated reliably as a step in a consumer exposure assessment. Considering (a) the total number of reported human cases in the UK in 2009 was 158 (which is likely to be an underestimated figure for the actual number of cases, given that enhanced surveillance in England and Wales confirmed 422 cases in 2009) [16] and (b) the briefly described consequences for PH in Chapter 3.3 - especially for the group of young, old, pregnant, immune -compromised and sick (YOPIS) - the risk of T. gon dii to PH could be considered as moderate . The results suggest that GO inspection does not have an influence on the final exposure, i.e. risk for PH (based on a presence of hazard in carcase meat in a chilling room, as a proxy for final exposure). Salmon ella Salmonella in pigs is assessed as a hazard to PH. Our assessment aim ed to evaluate: 1. Whether different GO inspection scenarios have different capacity of detecting the hazard. 2. whether the consumer's exposure to Salmonella spp. is greater if GO inspecti on is not performed in the current way. Model characteristics and assumptions In the specific case of Salmonella spp., the hazard is not only represented by infected pigs arriving at chilling, but healthy pigs that can become cross -contaminated during slaughter contributing to the risk to PH. As the risk to PH arises from faecal contamination of the surface of meat, the change in prevalence of Salmonella on the carcase surfaces was modelled. The risk assessment includes two extra steps at slaughter: FCI an d possibility for cross contamination. It is assumed that batches of animals from high -prevalent herds can be detected by the accompanying food chain information (FCI) and therefore would be slaughtered at the end of the day under a higher level of alertne ss. These animals were excluded from routine slaughter at step \"FCI\" on the risk pathway. 54 The risk assessment pathway includes the slaughter activities, as these are known to crucially contribute either to decreasing the prevalence of the hazard or to inc rease it via cross -contamination. See figure 3 for a graphical representation of the Salmonella risk assessment model, along with the results. Further assumptions, input data, data sources and data gaps are presented in annex 3, table 20. Results Lairage : According to the results of the EFSA baseline study the prevalence of Salmonella spp. in pigs in the UK is 21.2 % (17.8 % - 25 %) [20]. The Salmonella status of a herd is displayed in the FCI and the proportion of animals from herds with high intra -herd Salmonella prevalen ce (> 50 %) which are separated for logistic slaughter purposes is assumed to be low. As infection with S. Typhimurium, the most frequent isolated serovar in pigs, is usually subclinical in the considered age category the probability that animals are detec ted during ante-mortem inspection and separated from the rest of the batch is negligible . Due to the high proportion of \"clean\" animals being cross -contaminated by shedders, the probability that Salmonella is present in/on an animal upon arrival at slaught er hall is moderate . Slaughter process : During slaughter the Salmonella prevalence (i.e. proportion of animal s carrying the hazard) changes substantially from one process to the next [43- 47]. This is in line with reports in the literature: pre valence figures of samples taken after the respective slaughter activities are not consistent in the literature and range from 0 % - 100 %. To inform our risk assessment, results from several studies were compared and average values were chosen based on t he variable stated trends (see annex 2). Scalding and singeing were identified as major steps that highly reduce the Salmonella prevalence. Between polishing and dressing, the prevalence raises again back to moderate level. Trimming may bring a further very low reduction. At the end of slaughter the model assumes that Salmonella is present in/on a moderate proportion of carcases presented to post-mortem inspection (see fig. 3). 55 Figure 3: Graphic representation of the model applied to Salmonella spp. N = Negligible, VL = Very low, L = Low, M = Moderate, H = High . The ongoing risk for a pathway is shown in dimonds after each input step. Probability of a carcase carrying a hazard at chilling 56 Post -mortem inspection : Faecal contamination (both in infected and healthy animals) and acute enteritis/enterocolitis (in infected animals) are regarded to be the only \"visual conditions\" caused by Salmonella . Only a very low percentage of carcases show lesions during visual i nspection of the whole carcase. Microscopic contamination is below the \"detection limit\" of a meat inspector's eye. For that reason the probability of a carcase being rejected at this inspection step is negligible . Green offal : The probability that a macroscopic lesion is present in GO is low (tab. 12). Even if the probability that these lesions will be detected by current GO inspection is high, only a very low percentage of carcases will be rejected for reasons of acute entero colitis, spillage of gut content or faecal contamination of the guts. Corrective actions by the slaughterhouse personnel will target visible lesions but will only result in a very low reduction of the number of carcases carrying Salmonella . The final outc ome of the model is that the risk of a carcase being contaminated with Salmonella at the entrance of the chilling room is medium . Nevertheless, the process of chilling is known to lead to a moderate reduction of the prevalence of Salmonella on pig carcases . For this reason, after the required hours of chilling the actual probability of a carcase carrying Salmonella would become low (see fig. 3). Alternative GO inspection scenarios : the model suggests that GO inspection has the ability to detect (with low probability) visual conditions associated with Salmonella . Nevertheless, the different GO inspection scenarios, including absence of inspection, result in no substantial difference in the Salmonella prevalence at the chilling room ( it remains moderate for the three scenarios). This is related to fact that detection of the conditions associated with Salmonella (faecal contamination and enteritis) will not result in rejection of the carcase. It is likely that a lower number of acute enterocolitis cases woul d be detected if lymph nodes were not palpated [48]. Without GO inspection enterocolitis will not be detected at all. But as the number of enterocolitis cases presented at post-mortem is generally very low and the probabi lity that carcases are rejected if lesions are seen in their GO is negligible , the combined probability of the presence of a macroscopic lesion, its detection by the meat inspector and the ensuing condemnation is negligible . 57 Table 12.

Several studies supported the finding that there is an enormous variation in Salmonella prevalence on different sampling days and even a significant difference between samples taken from morning or afternoon production [46]. Therefore, the i nput values for animal prevalence (low) and the proportion of contaminated/infected animals upon arrival at the slaughter -hall ( moderate ) were changed from low to very low, moderate and high in the sensitivity analysis. In all three scenarios the prevalenc e at chilling remained low. This finding can be explained by the fact that the model assumes that scalding and singeing will reduce any initial prevalence to a low level and that a high number of carcases will be contaminated after dehairing and eviscerati on. 58 Discussion In 2007, the total PH costs for a family with a case of S. Typhimurium were estimated to be as high as \u00a3 14,700 per case; the annual case number in the UK was predicted to be around 6 00 (with an underreporting of 1 :3 or even 1:4) [17, 19]. In addition to such direct human costs in terms of illn ess and suffering, the association of food poisoning outbreaks with pork products has major economic impacts on the pork processing industry [43]. Several studies reported findings of different patterns of Salmonella serotypes after various stages during pork slaughter [43, 45]. This interesting finding implies that carcases get contaminated with residual microflo ra present in the abattoirs during the slaughter process [49]. Salmonella spp. already present on the skin of live animals are less likely to survive scalding and singeing [50]. In the recently publishe d Quantitative Microbiological Risk Assessment (QMRA) on Salmonella in Slaughter and Breeder pigs [47] the prevalence increases to 100 % after evisceration, attributable to the so called house flora, contaminating every carcase with a small amount of Salmonella spp. Without doubt the probability of detecting this type of contamination at post-mortem inspection is very low , resulting in a high risk of storing Salmonella -positive carcases in the chilling room. Even if the load of bacteria is confined to a very small number of cfu and might not pose a PH risk if consumed immediately, poor managem ent of hygiene and product control in the consecutive steps in the food chain can lead to bacterial growth. Therefore the results of slaughterhouse prevalence data should be interpreted with caution. Scientific studies in the past concluded that t he risk to PH will remain as long as Salmonella -positive animals enter abattoirs, even if the slaughter process is carried out according to stringent codes of good manufacturing practices [50]. The results describe d above highlight that the current control strategies carried out, including MI, may be able to decrease the risk to PH at this stage of the food chain, but are insufficient to fully remove the risk. Classical Swine Fever CSF is assessed as a hazard to A H. This assessment aimed to evaluate two aspects of risk to pig health : 1. whether a difference exists between the three scenarios of GO inspection in their capability to detect lesions associated with CSF. 59 2. whether the exposure of susceptible livestock to CSFV from carcases of infected pigs varies for different GO inspection scenarios; Disease characteristics and assumptions Clinical signs in pigs infected with CSF are usually very unspecific; therefore it is difficult to diagnose the disease if only one s ingle pig is infected, as the list of differential diagnoses is long [25]. Therefore, CSF is often described as a herd disease: clinical and pathological signs become more obvious if the herd as a whole is investigated [51, 52]. To take account of this important fact, the risk questions were assessed for two different situations: Situation 1 - \"low prevalence\": a single pig out of a batch of 50 anima ls is infected (prevalence is 2 %); Situation 2 - \"high prevalence\": ten pigs out of a batch of 50 animals are infected (prevalence is 20 %). As CSF is not present in the UK, the following background scenario was assumed: Finisher pigs have been infected on a farm approximately 30 days before being sent to slaughter with a moderately virulent CSF strain. All animals are CSF -positive, but do not necessarily show lesions. Further assumptions, input parameter s, data sources and data gaps are listed in annex 4, table 21 (situation 1) and table 22 (situation 2). Results Lairage: CSF-positive animals can show a range of clinical symptoms that can b e detected during ante-mortem inspection. The probability that these animals will be detected at ante -mortem inspection is low, with a large amount of them likely to be sent for routine slaughter3. Post -mortem inspection : A variety of lesions ptoduced b y CSF can be seen during visual inspection of the carcase, head, lungs, spleen, heart, liver, kidneys, pleura, peritoneum and GO. Lesions will not necessarily be present in more than one organ system. The post - 3 This assumes that, although lesions may be detected in few animals at AM inspection, CSF will not be suspected. In the case of CSF being suspected, none of the animals from that batch will be processed normally. Our assessment does not consider this scena rio. 60 mortem MI tasks have only low or very low pro bability of detection of the hazard. As a consequence, mainly due to the fact that the modelled prevalence is very low, the probability of the hazard being present at chiller is very low . Green offal : Exam ples of lesions in GO are enlarged lymph nodes, d ry or watery faecal contents in colon or jejunum, oedema of the mesocolon, a hyperaemic intestinal tract and fibrin in the abdomen. In a moderate proportion of cases, at least one of these pathological conditions will be present. If a lesion is present, th e probability that it will be detected is moderate . As a result, GO inspection (current and visual) contributes to the detection of CSF infected animals ( low), whereas total absence of GO inspection does not (negligible ). Nevertheless, the probability of carcases carrying the hazard at chilling is not influenced by the type of GO inspection carried out, mainly due to the fact that findings at GO are very unlikely to result in rejection of the whole carcase. Situation 1 (single animal) : When the model was run for a batch formed of only one infected pig, the probability that a CSF -contaminated carcase was present in the chiller was high with the probability of this carcase showing lesions being low (it is assumed that all abnormalities noticed by meat inspectors are trimmed consecutively). If run for a batch of 50 animals, the overall probability of having a CSF- positive carcase in the chiller was low, and the probability of a carcase showing lesions remained low. Situat ion 2 (group) : if ten out of 50 pigs in lairage were CSF -positive, the probability that these pigs show at least one clinical sign was high (tab. 14). With a moderate probability of detection during ante-mortem and high probability that suspicious animals will be separated, only a small (low) number of cases will be allowed to be slaughtered routinely. The probabilit y that lesions will be present and detected in organs other than GO and that the carcases will be rejected are high. At GO inspection a high proportion of guts show lesions and in a moderate number of cases these findings will lead to the rejection of the carcase. The probabilities of a carcase a) carrying the CSF -Virus or b) showing lesions associated with CSF at the point of chilling are both very low . 61 Table 13. Situation 1 .

Therefore the model predicts the same probability of detection of a lesion in GO ( moderate ) for the alternative GO inspection and for visual only inspection. However, if GO inspection is absent and no lesions are detected, the final result of the model will not change - the prevalence of CSF -positive carcases in the chiller is still very low (single pig)/ low (group). Sensitivity analysis: A sensitivity analysis was made to estimate the proportion of missed cases if the sensitivity of MI, i.e. the probability that lesions will be detected, would change from moderate to high or low. With a high detection rate for every MI task, a high number of lesions could be detected, but nevertheless the prevalence of CSF -positive carcases at chilling would not decrease further from low (single pig) and very low (group) if the total condemnation rate were to remain very low . 62 Table 14.

Discussion One of the purposes of MI is to identify exotic contagious livestock diseases, including CSF, among others. The results of our risk model indicate that infected animals can be to a large extent detected with ante- and post-mortem inspection. An interesting finding is that the probability of having a CSF -positive carcase, or a carcase with lesions associated with CSF, at point of chilling is in all three GO scenarios very low, irrespectively of whether CSF causes lesions in GO with a moderate (situation 1) or even wi th a high (situation 2) likelihood. The reason for this is that, in the model, a low (situation 1)/ moderate (situation 2) number of infected pigs with lesions is already detected at ante-mortem . In addition, the likelihood that a pig shows lesions exclusiv ely in GO is very low . Therefore, animals with lesions in GO 63 are likely to have been already detected with other MI tasks earlier on in the process. As a consequence the final proportion of CSF -positive carcases in the chiller does not change substantially , whether or not GO is inspected. This finding is supported by a Danish risk assessment which conclude d that the ability to identify exotic contagious diseases is not affected if the stomach and the intestines are visually inspected instead of palpating i ntestinal lymph nodes, as the infection usually results in lesions in other organs in addition to the ones in the intestinal lymph nodes [48]. Abdominal and inguinal hernia In this model hernias in pigs are considered fro m an AW perspective. This assessment has the aim to evaluate: 1. whether the capability of detecting lesions associated with this hazard is different for different GO scenarios. In this context the probability of a carcase presenting with lesions associated w ith hernia at the point of chilling is used as a proxy for a lack of identification, and therefore consequent reporting, of this AW issue; Model assumptions, input data, data sources and data gaps are presented in annex 4, table 23. Results Lairage : The prevalence of abdominal and inguinal hernias in the UK is assumed to be very low . A moderate part of pigs with hernia will be detected during ante-mortem , but given that it is very unlikely that this finding will lead to a rejection of the whole carcase, the probability that an animal will not be sent to routine slaughter as a consequence of the detection is negligible Post -mortem inspection : The probabilities that lesions are present and detected during visual inspection of the whole carcase are high (tab. 1 5) as the hernia sac is usually visible from the inside of the abdominal wall. Hernias can sometimes lead to peritonitis and strangulation, and eventually to infection of the trapped gut. For th is reason, a moderate number of macroscopic lesions c ould be present on the peritoneum; they will be spotted with a high probability but only lead to rejection of the carcase in a low proportion of cases. 64 Green offal : With GO, the probability that a lesion is present during inspection is high as is the detection probability (tab. 1 5). Rejection of the whole carcase due to lesions in GO is the consequence in a negligible proportion of cases as normally only GO will be rejected in this situation. In addition, such incidents will be reported to the carcase in spector so that they check for peritonitis or faecal contamination in case of gut rupture. After having passed post-mortem inspection, the probability is very low that a carcase presents with lesions associated with hernia. Lesions associated with hernias (pouches in carcase wall, peritonitis, altered intestine) detected during post-mortem inspection are assumed to be trimmed; as a matter of these rectifications on ly a negligible proportion of carcases will present with lesions at point of chilling. Alternative GO inspection scenarios : No literature was found that describes a special link between gastric and mesenteric lymph nodes and hernia. Hence, our model sugg ests no difference in the probability of a carcase presenting with lesions whether the current GO inspection is carried out or whether GO is only visually inspected. Given that lesions on the carcase wall and in the peritoneum are highly likely to be detec ted during visual inspection of the carcase and peritoneum, potentially missed lesions in GO do not result in a change of the ultimate prevalence of lesions at point of chilling.

This can be explained by the fact that in its application to hernia the model relies strongly on two factors: \"probability that a lesion will be detected by visual inspection of the whol e carcase\" and \"probability that a lesion will be detected by visual inspection of the peritoneum\". As long as a high proportion of lesions will be detected when the surfaces of a carcase are inspected only a negligible number of lesions will be missed. Sh ould only a moderate number of lesions be detected with inspection of the whole carcase, the prevalence of lesions at chilling will rise from negligible to very low . Discussion The application of the risk model to an AW condition like hernia shows that i f the contribution(s) of a single or two MI tasks to detect a lesion (or hazard) are already high, the remaining MI task will play a minor role in raising the overall capability to detect signs of compromised animal wellbeing or disease. Prevalence estim ates from literature [31, 32, 34] and expert elicitation do not confirm the l ow rejection rate recorded in data provided by the Food Standards Agency. A possible explanation for this apparent underreporting is given in a Canadian study that suggests that, given that over 50 % of pigs with large hernias will be condemned for periton itis, carcase lesions be recorded as \"peritonitis\" at the abattoir [31]. By doing so a present undesired condition is communicated, but the origin of the problem is not revealed , limiting its value to detect and act upon AW issues. Besides the discussion on economic losses due to rejection of carcases, welfare is an important consideration in the decision made concerning the care and production of young pigs with hernias. The welfare of pigs with severe adhesions on the intestines and skin may be significantly compromised. [34]. According to literature some degree of fibrin adhesion is evident in all cases [34]. Inspectors should be observe for these adhesions, visible at slaughter, in order to increase the protection of AW. It is unlikely that large hernias with compli cations, such as strangulation of intestine, abscessed hernia sac or peritonitis will not be detected at the abattoir. Again, inspection has a great value in the identification of this AW concern. Nevertheless, if these findings are not appropriately docum ented and reported, MI will not have any impact on protecting AW. 66 Tail biting Tail biting in pigs is assessed as an AW hazard. This assessment aimed to evaluate: 1. whether the capability of detecting the lesion associated with this hazard is different for the GO scenarios considered. Model characteristics and assumptions Animals with healed tails are not considered, only those where lesion are still present. In this context the hazard is \"being the victim of tail biting with visible lesions\" Further assumptions, input data, data sources and data gaps are listed in annex 4, table 24. Results Lairage : The prevalence of tail biting was assumed to be very low . The probability that tail bite lesions will be noticed during ante-mortem inspection is high, but the proportion of tail bitten pigs that will be rejected from further slaughter is assumed to be negligible (tab. 1 6). Post -mortem inspection : Lesions can be seen during visual inspection of the whole carcase and, additionally, in the lungs [53]. The probabilities that lesions are present and that these are detected during visual carcase inspection are both high. Tail bite is associated with a moderate proportion of carcases being condemned. In the lungs abscesses will be present only in a low proportion of tail bitten animals, but a high percentage of these will be rejected. The model predicts that a high proportion of tail bites will be found during post- morte m, but only a low proportion of these will be trimmed after this condition has been detected (in addition to the moderate number of rejected carcases). Green offal : No literature was found describing the presence of abscesses in GO as a consequence of tail bites. The body parts and organs mostly affected are the carcase, including the tail and spine, and the lung; rarely abscesses can be found in the heart, liver, umbilicus, head and peritoneum [36, 39]. Therefore GO inspection plays a negligible role in the detection of tail bite lesions. As a result, modification of GO inspection has no effect on the prevalence of carcases with lesions in the chiller. 67 Table 16. Summary of the intermediate (green cells) and final results (pink cells) of t he risk model for tail biting (likelihood categories: N = negligible, VL = very low, L = low, M = moderate, H = high) STEP Prevalence (%) Probability lesions are present probability lesions are detected Within - step probability Inter -step and final probability Infected animal at abattoir VL LAIRAGE AM inspection H H H N POSTMORTEM Lungs inspection L H L N Whole carcase inspection H H H N GREEN OFFAL Scenario 1 N N N N Scenario 2 N N N Scenario 3 N N N CHILLING N Sensitivity analysis : Considering prevalence close to 100% (all animal at slaughter presenting with tail biting) the model predicts that approximately every second case would lead to the carcase being condemned. Therefore the initial high proportion of tail bitten pigs at chilling can be reduced to moderate . The risk of having missed carcases with tail bites can only be reduced to a negligible risk if the initial prevalence is lower or if a high proportion of carcases detected during visual inspection of the whole carcase were rejected. Discussion MI tasks seem to have a good capacity to detect hernias, with the exception of GO inspection. Lesions on these organs as a consequence of tail biting a re extremely unlikely, and therefore the contribution of GO inspection to the reduction of risk to AW is negligible. An interesting finding was that only a minor part of all tail bites detected during post-mortem inspection may actually be recorded. Reject ion data provided by the Food Standards Agency showed that tail bite is only reported in 1.7 per 10,000 pigs. Literature and expert opinion suggested a much higher proportion of severe tail bite wounds and secondary complications [36, 39, 53, 54] which often result in abscessation. Hence, it is likely that the ultimate reason for condemnation may often be reported as pyaemia or multiple abscessations without being associated with tail bite injuries . This translates into underreporting of tail biting at slaughter. 68 Annex 4 - Model assumptions, input data, data sources and data gaps.

Mostly: carcase incl. tail and spine, lung, rarely in heart, liver, umbilicus, head and peritoneum N Author's opinion, supported by Huey et al., 1996; EFSA, 2007 GO inspection Scenario 1 Probability that lesion will be detected by current green offal inspection N Author's opinion Corrective action: Probability that whole carcase will be condemned N Author's opinion GO inspection Scenario 2 Probability that lesion in GO cannot be seen but palpated N Author's opinion Probability that lesion will be detected by only visual green offal inspection N Author's opinion Corrective action: Probability that whole carcase will be condemned N Author's opinion GO inspection Scenario 3 Probability that lesion will be detected without green offal inspection N Author's opinion Corrective action: Probability that whole carcase will be condemned N Author's opinion Other Laboratory testing Probability that a sample is taken for further laboratory diagnosis N Author's opinion Carcase rectification after PM All lesions that are detected will be trimmed, but only lesions present on whole carcase, peritoneum and pleura are understood as lesions on carcase (and will therefore lead to a reduction of lesion prevalence on the carcase) - Assumption Chilling Change of prevalence/load in/on carcase through chilling N Author's opinion Hazard is present as long carcase of tail bitten animal is in chiller - Assumption Lesion is present as long carcase of tail bitten animal is in chiller, which has not be tail -trimmed - Assumption 84 Table 14: Meat inspection tasks according to Regulation (EC) No 854/2004.
