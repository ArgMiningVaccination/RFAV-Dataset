Our thyroid gland also plays an important role with our immunity, wellbeing and weight control. And as if to draw attention to its role, over the last couple of markets, in particular, several people have enquired about crystals to assist in balancing their thyroid. Strengthening Your Immune System with Crystals. The immune system is our primary defence mechanism; it protects us from attack by external agents such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, and so on. If our immune system isn't healthy, a simple scratch could be fatal. Our immune system is also impacted by our emotions and thoughts which may strengthen or weaken it. That's why it's essential to ensure that our immune system is functioning as well as possible to effectively combat aggressors. A well-balanced lifestyle, positive mental attitude, healthy diet, exercise, and the use of crystals will enable us to improve our immune response and stay healthy. It is wise to develop a strong immune system, where good habits and prevention play a key role. In today's developed society from the moment we're born we are exposed to a toxic environment where pesticides, pollution, electromagnetic waves, and countless other negative influences abound and compromise our immune systems.
