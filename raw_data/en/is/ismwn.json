While not listed as the introducers of the bill, some of the most significant proponents of this bill were Senator Dennis L. Jones, a chiropractic \"physician,\" and his friend Senator Jim King, who at the time, was the President of the Florida Senate. The whole situation was atypical in that the Florida Senate completely bypassed the authority of the Board of Governors responsible for overseeing the state's public universities, and Governor Jeb Bush ended up signing the bill with little consideration of the consequences. Pretty quickly thereafter, the scientific faculty and student body began to speak out against the opening of a chiropractic school, as it would undermine FSU's legitimacy as a high-ranking research university. The effort was spearheaded by Dr. Raymond Bellamy, husband of CSICON 2019 speaker Jann Bellamy. Fortunately, the Board of Governors voted down the opening of the chiropractic school, but the whole experience left attorney Jann Bellamy frustrated. She began to question how complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), a field wrought with pseudoscientific claims that put vulnerable patients in danger, could become legitimized by law. There exists a false perception that the CAM industry is an innocent, well-intentioned alternative to both the pharmaceutical industry, regularly critiqued as greedy and profit-driven, and the medical establishment, with a long history of unethical practices that have bred mistrust. However, the CAM industry is just that, an industry worth $34 billion. As a result, the CAM industry's lobbying power has grown significantly in recent years. During the Obama Administration, lobbying by the American Chiropractic Association and the Integrative Healthcare Policy Consortium resulted in the addition of a clause to the Affordable Care Act that protects anyone who claims to provide healthcare services from being \"discriminated\" against by insurance companies. As Johns Hopkins professor Steven Salzberg described it, \"Section 2706 opens the door to anyone who provides what they claim is health care - no matter how ridiculous the claim - to file a lawsuit claiming discrimination if an insurance company won't pay for their services. You could start offering dried bird poop for arthritis, call it 'avian nature therapy,' and if an insurer won't pay for it, you can sue.\" We cannot allow legislation to draw a false equivalence between empirically substantiated and pseudoscientific medical practices. Some people are hesitant to critique CAM because, in the end, everyone has the right to choose the type of treatment they wish to undergo for a particular condition. However, an adult deciding to regularly visit a chiropractor for chronic back pain instead of pursuing a permanent surgical fix is one thing. An adult deciding to forgo conventional treatment for life-threatening illnesses in favor of visiting a naturopath is another\u2014or even worse, making that decision on behalf of their ill child. Former naturopath and CSICON 2019 speaker Britt Marie Hermes has repeatedly called for the prohibition of naturopaths from treating children. One particularly disturbing case in Canada involved 19-month-old Ezekiel Stephan, who died as a result of bacterial meningitis. His parents first attempted to treat him at home with natural remedies and smoothies. When his condition worsened, a family friend and nurse warned his parents that Ezekiel was likely suffering from meningitis and urged them to take him to the emergency room. Instead, parents David and Collet Stephan took their son to a naturopath, who ended up providing them with echinacea and no instruction regarding seeking any further medical care. Ezekiel's parents were initially convicted of failing to provide the necessities of life. After a lengthy appeal process and the order of a new trial, however, they were acquitted in September 2019 by Justice Terry Clackson. The justice ignored the irrefutable medical evidence provided by the forensic pathologist who performed Ezekiel's autopsy. Ezekiel's story is not an anomaly, and it serves to demonstrate that the United States and other countries such as Canada are heading in the wrong direction when it pertains to the legislation of CAM. Regulations on CAM providers cannot continue down this path of relaxation and legitimization. CAM poses a real danger to the health of individuals and strengthens the disturbing trend Americans are currently witnessing against evidence-based reasoning. In approaching the issue, individuals such as Jann Bellamy and Britt Marie Hermes have continued to argue for policy changes that allow for the increased regulation of CAM providers. For instance, an incredibly problematic trend is states allowing CAM practitioners to use the title of \"doctor\" or \"physician,\" implying that they go through the same level of rigorous training as medical doctors with either M.D. or D.O. degrees. In addition, with increasing frequency, states are considering bills that allow naturopaths to be eligible to receive medical licenses. This is currently permitted in twenty-two states as well as the District of Columbia. What can we do as members of the skeptic community? If any CAM legislation is up for review in your state, it is imperative that you contact your representatives and promote evidence-based practices. Acknowledgements: I would like to start by thanking Jann Bellamy for taking the time to sit down with me, allowing me to interview her at CSICON 2019, and providing me with a substantial amount of background information on the issue of CAM legitimization in legislation and inspiring my further research into this issue. I would also like to thank Britt Marie Hermes for her insightful presentation at CSICON 2019 and her bravery in speaking out about the dangers of CAM considering her own background as a former naturopath. I am also immensely grateful for the generosity of CFI's Sherry Sheng who funded the student scholarships to attend CSCICON 2019. Finally, I would like to thank CFI's Martina Fern for taking on all of the logistical planning for students' travel and speaker interviews. "}
