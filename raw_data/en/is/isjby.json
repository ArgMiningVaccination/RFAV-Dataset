Methods: Data were collected through questionnaires administered by means of interviews. Results: Data highlighted that 20% of mothers showed an orientation towards vaccine hesitancy. As for the reasons behind the attitude to vaccine hesitancy, data showed that concern is a common feature. As for the different exposures to communication, 49% of mothers did not remember having received or looked for any information about vaccination during pregnancy and post-partum; 25% stated they received information from several healthcare and non-healthcare sources; 26% declared having received or looked for information by means of healthcare and non-healthcare sources, as well as having taken part in a specific meeting during antenatal classes or at birth centres. The attitude towards vaccine hesitancy tends to reduce as exposure to different communication increases. Conclusions: This study supports the hypothesis that participation in interactive meetings in small groups focused on vaccination during the prenatal course or at the birth point may act as an enabling factor contributing to a decrease in the tendency to experience vaccine hesitation.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2020-11-20", "cleaned_text": "Vaccination Attitude and Communication in Early Settings: An Exploratory Study [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8040701](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8040701) [Strategies to Increase Vaccination Coverage There is still much to do in order to promote vaccine empowerment and increase parents' knowledge, abilities and skills, enabling them to make aware choices [ [7](#B7-vaccines-08-00701), [8](#B8-vaccines-08-00701), [9](#B9-vaccines-08-00701)]. A small part of the population is firmly opposed to all vaccines, while about 20-30% has doubts and concerns that may lead to delay in acceptance/refusal of some vaccines or to follow the vaccine schedule with reluctance [ [10](#B10-vaccines-08-00701), [11](#B11-vaccines-08-00701)]. [10](#B10-vaccines-08-00701)]. Knowledge on vaccines is one of the factors that affect parents' decision-making process, and consequently communication is one of the strategies that can contribute to address vaccine hesitancy. Parents' knowledge about vaccination results from complex, and not always conscious, interactions of information from different sources, not only the recommendation/advice of healthcare providers, but also the opinions of family members and friends, media, websites, online social networks, and ideas arising from direct or indirect experiences. The internet and the media are widely used by anti-vaccinists to amplify scientifically unfounded information about vaccines (e.g., the presence of heavy metals) and thus favouring scepticism and mistrust [15](#B15-vaccines-08-00701), [16](#B16-vaccines-08-00701), [17](#B17-vaccines-08-00701)]. Overall, parents receive several messages regarding vaccines, often even conflicting, they interpret them subjectively, and give them an overall meaning that, even if it is not supported by scientific evidence, will guide their choices [ [18](#B18-vaccines-08-00701), [19](#B19-vaccines-08-00701)]. In the age of globalisation, public health services cannot prevent different stakeholders from disseminating news without scientific evidence, but they have the duty to strengthen their ability to communicate effectively regarding vaccines. No opportunities should be missed in order to meet parents' needs and spread the culture of vaccination [ [2](#B2-vaccines-08-00701), [20](#B20-vaccines-08-00701), [21](#B21-vaccines-08-00701)]. [7](#B7-vaccines-08-00701), [8](#B8-vaccines-08-00701)]. It means implementing interactive processes based on the exchange of information, knowledge, needs, attitudes, and emotions between the involved parties. Additionally, communicating effectively means identifying settings where parents can be more receptive to the issues of vaccines [ [22](#B22-vaccines-08-00701), [23](#B23-vaccines-08-00701)]. The literature suggests the importance of early settings, in which communication interventions are carried out in a temporal context that precedes the administration of vaccines, leaving parents time to consider, discuss and reflect on the received information [ [24](#B24-vaccines-08-00701), [25](#B25-vaccines-08-00701), [26](#B26-vaccines-08-00701), [27](#B27-vaccines-08-00701)]. Prenatal courses and birth points can be considered \"early settings\" in which the communication regarding vaccines is carried out through interactive methods during pregnancy or within the days of delivery, i.e., at least two-three months before the first session of vaccination. [28](#B28-vaccines-08-00701)]. The hypothesis of an association between vaccine attitude and exposure to interactive meetings in an early setting, if supported by several studies, could trigger further studies with experimental designs, leading to institutionalising meetings on vaccines in prenatal courses and at birth centres. 2. Methods 2.1. Context of the Study 2.2. Design of the Study 2.3. Recruitment of Participants 2.4. Questionnaire Did you receive or seek information on vaccines during pregnancy /childbirth? Consider both health and non-health sources.(yes or no) During the pre-natal course and/or at birth point did you have the opportunity to participate in small group meetings (about 8-10 people), conducted in a participatory way (not frontal lessons, but interactive meetings where you could express yourselves freely), and focused on the topic of vaccines (vaccination schedule, benefits and risks)?(yes or no) - If you had the opportunity to participate in these meetings, was it useful?(yes or no) - If you did not attend these meetings, would you have been glad to have this opportunity?(yes or no) - Are you going to submit your child to the free vaccinations offered by the National Health System, within the proposed timetable?(open ended question) - If you are not going to submit your child to all the free vaccinations offered by the National Health System, which vaccines are you more hesitant about and why?(open ended question) [Figure 1](#vaccines-08-00701-f001). - (1) - \"Non-exposed group\", i.e., mothers who declare that they have not received or looked for any specific information on vaccines during pregnancy/childbirth and who have not attended meetings on this topic. - (2) - \"Group exposed to conventional communication\", i.e., mothers who declare that, during pregnancy/childbirth, they have received and/or looked for information about vaccines by means of healthcare and non-healthcare sources, but who have not attended meetings on this topic. - (3) - \"Group exposed to conventional and early communication\", i.e., mothers who declare that they have received or looked for information about vaccines by means of healthcare and non-healthcare sources, and who have attended meetings about vaccines during the prenatal course and/or at birth point. - (1) - Pro-vaccine attitude, i.e., mothers who steadily declare that they would follow the vaccination schedule offered by the NHS (both compulsory and recommended) without any doubt or concern. - (2) - Vaccine hesitancy attitude, i.e., mothers who express strong perplexity and reluctancy and/or declare that they would not entirely follow the vaccination schedule proposed by the NHS. 2.5. Data Analysis 3. Results 3.1. Sample Description [Table 1](#vaccines-08-00701-t001). 3.2. Attitude to Vaccination [Figure 2](#vaccines-08-00701-f002)). 3.3. Exposure to Information on Vaccines [Table 2](#vaccines-08-00701-t002). 3.4. Association between Attitude to Vaccination and Different Exposures to Communication Regarding Vaccines [Table 3](#vaccines-08-00701-t003)). [Table 4](#vaccines-08-00701-t004). 4. Discussion [1](#B1-vaccines-08-00701), [11](#B11-vaccines-08-00701), [28](#B28-vaccines-08-00701), [29](#B29-vaccines-08-00701)]. These findings confirm the specific needs that need to be addressed to communicate effectively about early childhood vaccinations. Not only balanced information about both the benefits and risks of vaccinations, but also support for the management of parents' concern [ [11](#B11-vaccines-08-00701), [13](#B13-vaccines-08-00701), [25](#B25-vaccines-08-00701), [30](#B30-vaccines-08-00701)]. This concern, that in vaccine-hesitant mothers seems to be an important criterion in the subjective process of risk/benefit assessment of vaccinations, cannot be ignored or diminished. To promote vaccination empowerment, concern must be accepted and understood in depth, only in this way is it possible to give an adequate response to the emotional component and to the underlying cognitive needs, and to support mothers in the conscious decision-making process regarding the vaccination of their noteworthy that the usefulness of interpersonal communication with health professionals was confirmed by almost all the interviewed vaccine-hesitant mothers who did not take part in any meetings taking place in early settings; indeed, they declared that they would be glad to have this opportunity. [13](#B13-vaccines-08-00701), [14](#B14-vaccines-08-00701), [31](#B31-vaccines-08-00701)]. The present study supports the hypothesis that participation in interactive meetings in small groups focused on vaccination during the prenatal course or at the point of birth may act as an enabling factor. This can lead to a decrease in the tendency to experience vaccine hesitation [ [11](#B11-vaccines-08-00701), [25](#B25-vaccines-08-00701), [32](#B32-vaccines-08-00701), [33](#B33-vaccines-08-00701)]. It is well known that the effectiveness of a communication process also depends on the setting in which the communication is carried out, it is important to identify places, times and mental states in which the recipients are most receptive [ [25](#B25-vaccines-08-00701)]. Earlier communication could facilitate message reception, thanks to the iterative process, through which evidence-based messages are transmitted, listened to, appraised, compared with messages from other sources, re-discussed, and finally, evaluated according to the same meaning they have for those who issued it [ [2](#B2-vaccines-08-00701), [23](#B23-vaccines-08-00701), [24](#B24-vaccines-08-00701), [25](#B25-vaccines-08-00701), [26](#B26-vaccines-08-00701)]. It is reasonable to suppose that the communication carried out as part of the prenatal course or at point of birth is associated with a decrease in the tendency to experience vaccine hesitation, not only due to the use of the interpersonal channel, but also due to the timing of communication\u2014about three months before the first vaccine session. [1](#B1-vaccines-08-00701), [11](#B11-vaccines-08-00701)]. Further experimental studies are needed in order to deepen these results and investigate which features of the meetings on vaccines during the prenatal course or at birth point could help in reducing this recent survey conducted in Italy, vaccine hesitancy did not appear to be influenced by communication in antenatal settings [ [28](#B28-vaccines-08-00701)]. However, we cannot overlook the fact that our assessment of exposure to communication (i.e., participation in interactive meetings) differed from the ones used in that study (i.e., receiving information). Consequently, it is reasonable to hypothesise that the difference between the results of the two studies on the role of communication in the antenatal setting may be affected by the different definition of the variable under study. Moreover, methods for data collection in our study were based on interviews with mothers of children younger than 4 months of age, while in the other study was based on a self-administered questionnaire with parents of children between 16 and 36 months of age; it is not possible to exclude that recall bias had a different weight in the two studies, and it could also influence the evaluation of the association differently. According to several studies, the antenatal period is a crucial phase where it is possible to help parents to deepen and consolidate their knowledge of vaccines; there is some evidence of the importance of highlighting not only the merits of vaccinations for the protection of children's health, but also of fully understanding and meeting parents' concerns about the safety of vaccines. However, the specific information and approaches that are effective in communicating knowledge on vaccines with future mothers are not yet clearly defined. Further studies should focus on building a framework that defines the essential features for implementing communication intervention in the antenatal period. 5. Conclusions [22](#B22-vaccines-08-00701)]. The National Health System could begin to address this challenge by using the available resources in an effective and efficient way. Concern and perceived lack of information play a role in vaccine hesitancy, while communication regarding vaccines implemented in early settings through interpersonal channels could be an enabling factor for vaccine adherence. Considering that prenatal courses and birth points are already active across the national territory, including communication regarding vaccinations among the regular activities of these services could be a proper strategy.
