Because essential oils have the unique ability to balance emotions as well as the physical body, they are especially useful for balancing doshas. Ayurveda is a holistic approach to bringing balance and harmony in the body. According to Ayurveda, three doshas govern health: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. To learn about determining your dosha, check out the [Beginner's Guide to Ayurveda](https://lindseyelmore.com/beginners-guide-to-ayurveda/#fbComment). Ayurveda and Essential Oils Essential oils are useful in ayurvedic therapeutic formulations for their \"yogavahi\" value. This refers to their ability to transport the healing powers of the herbs, trees, and plants to the cells of the body. Additionally, essential oils help balance the emotions through the sense of smell, which directly impacts the limbic system. Therefore, essential oils offer a means to bring harmony among the physical, emotional, and spiritual bodies. Ayurvedic principles teach us that like creates like and opposites balance. So essential oils with qualities of a particular dosha will increase that dosha. Conversely, essential oils with attributes that are oppose a dosha will decrease or pacify that dosha. For example, an excess of Pitta dosha manifests as excess heat, such as infection, heartburn, inflammation, rashes and fever. To counteract this imbalance, one would use essential oils that are cooling. A Kapha-dominant person who suffers from allergies, colds, and depression may want to use essential oils to support respiration and uplift the emotions.
