CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASEREQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 6/2/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 1 Table of Contents Infectious Dose - How much agent will make a healthy individual ill? ..................................................................................... 3 The human infectious dose of severe acute r espiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2) is unknown by all exposure routes. SARS -CoV-2 is the cause of coronavi rus disease 19 (COVID -19). Studies from other animal models are used as surrogates for humans. Identifying the infectious dose for humans by the various routes through which we become infected is critical to the effective development of computational models to predict risk, develop diagnostics and countermeasures, and effective decontamination strategies. Anima l studies are a plausible surrogate. Transmissibility - How does it spread from one host to another? How easily is it spread? ...................................................... 4 SARS- CoV-2 is passed easily between humans, likely through close contact with relatively large droplets and possibly through smaller aerosolized particles. Individuals can transmit SARS -CoV-2 to others before they have symptoms. Undetected cases play a major role in transmission, a nd most cases are not reported. Individuals who have recovered clinically, but test positive, appear unable to transmit COVID -19. Identif ying the contribution of asymptomatic or pre -symptomatic transmission is important for implementing control measures. Additionally, the relative contributions of different infection sources - fomites, droplets, aerosols, and potentially feces - are unknown. Host Ra nge - How many species does it infect? Can it transfer from species to species? ......................................................... 5 SARS- CoV-2 is closely related to other coronavirus es circulating in bats in Southeast Asia. Previous coronaviruses have passed through an intermediate mammal host before infecting humans, but the identity of the SARS -CoV-2 intermediate host is unknown. SARS- CoV-2 uses the same receptor for cell entry as the SARS -CoV-1 coronavirus that circulated in 2002/2003. To date, ferrets, mink, hamsters, cats, and primates have been shown to be susceptible to SARS -CoV-2 infection. It is unknown whether th ese animals can transm it infection to humans. Several animal models have been developed to recreate human- like illness, though to date they have been infected with high dose exposures. Lower dose studies may better replicate human disease acquisi tion. Incubation Period - How long after infection do symptoms appear? Are people infectious during this time? .......................... 6 The majority of individuals develop symptoms withi n 14 days of exposure. For most people, it takes at least 2 days to develop symptoms, and on average symptoms develop 5 days after exposure. Incubating individuals can tran smit disease for several days before symptom onset. Some individuals never develop s ymptoms but can still transmit disease. The incubation period is well -characterized. Patients may be infectious, however, for days before sy mptoms develop. Clinical Presentation - What are the signs and symptoms of an infected person? ................................................................... 7 Many COVID -19 cases are asymptomatic. Most symptomatic cases are mild, but severe disease can be found in any age group.6 Older individuals and those with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk of serious illness and death. The case fatality rate varies substantially by patient age and underlying comorbidities. Additional studies on vulnerable subpopulations are required. Children are susceptible to COVID -19,116 though generally show milder76, 247 or no symptoms. The true case fatality rate is unknown, as the exact num ber of cases is uncertain. Testing priorities and case definitions vary by location. The proportion of asymptomatic infections is not known. Protective Immunity - How long does the immune response provide protection from reinfection? ........................................ 8 Infected patients show productive immune responses, however more data is needed. Currently, there is no evidence that recovered patients can be reinfec ted with SARS -CoV-2. Understanding the duration of protective immunity is limited by small sample sizes. Animal models are plausible surrogates. Additional research to quantify the risk of reinfection after weeks, months, an d years is ne eded. Clinical Diagnosis - Are there tools to diagnose infected individuals? When during infection are they effective? .................... 9 Diagnosis relies on identifying the genetic signature of the virus in patient nose, throat, or sputum samples. These tests are relatively accurate. Confirmed ca ses are still underreported. Validated serological (antibody) assays are being developed to h elp determine who has been exposed to SARS -CoV-2. Serological evidence of exposure does not indicate immunity. REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 6/2/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 2 In general, PCR tests appear to be sensitive and specific, though confirmation of symptoms via chest CT is recomm ended. The sensitivity and specificity of serological testing methods is variable, and additional work needs to be done to determin e factors that affect test accuracy. Medical Treatments - Are there effective treatments? ...........................................................................................................10 Treatmen t for COVID -19 is primarily supportive care including ventilation if necessary.155, 259 Numerous clinical trials are ongoing, but results are preliminary.33, 93 Several drugs show efficac y. Remdesivir shows promise for reduc ing symptom duration in humans.32 Hydroxychloroquine is associated with elevated risk of cardiac arrhythmias and provides limited to no clinical benefit at this point in time. Large, randomized clinical trial results are nec essary. Other pharmaceutical interventions are being investigated. Additional clinical trial results are being released, and data from these trials are needed. Vaccines - Are there effective vaccines? ................................................................................................................................. 11 Work is ongoing to develop a SARS -CoV-2 vaccine in human a nd animal trials. Early results are being released, but evidence should be considered preliminary until larger trials are completed. Published results from Phase I trials are needed. Non- pharm aceutical Interventions - Are public health control measures effective at reducing spread? ................................. 12 Broad -scale control measures such as s tay-at-home orders are effective at reducing movement and contact rates, and modeling shows evidence that they reduce transmission. The effect of relaxing control measures is unknown, and research is needed to help plan for easing of restrictions. As different US states have imp lemented differing control measures at various times, a comprehensive analysis of social distancing efficacy has not yet been conducted. Environmental Stability - How long does the agent live in the environment? .........................................................................13 SARS- CoV-2 can persist on surfaces for at least 3 days and on the surface of a surgical mask for up to 7 days depending on conditions. If aerosolized intentionally, SARS -CoV-2 is stable for at least sever al hours. The seasonality of COVID -19 transmission is unknown. SARS -CoV-2 on surfaces is inactivated rapidly with sunlight. Additional testing on SARS -CoV-2, as opposed to surrogate viruses, is needed to support initial esti mates of stability. Decontamination - What are effective methods to kill the agent in the environment? ..........................................................14 Soap and water, as well as common alcohol and chlorine -based cleaners, hand sanitize rs, and disinfectants are effective at inactivating SARS -CoV-2 on hands and surfaces. Methods for decontaminating N95 masks have been approved by the FDA under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). Additional decontamination studies, particularly with regard to PPE and other items in short supply, are needed. PPE - What PPE is effective, and who should be using it? .......................................................................................................15 The effectiveness of PPE for SARS -CoV-2 is currently unknown, and data from other related coronaviruses are used for guidance. Healthcare workers are at high risk of acquiring CO VID-19, even with recommended PPE. Most PPE recommendations have not been made on SARS -CoV-2 data, and comparative efficacy of different PPE for different tasks (e.g., intubation) is unknown. Identification of efficacious PP E for healthcare workers is critica l due to their high rates of infection. Forensics - Natural vs intentional use? Tests to be used for attribution. ................................................................................16 All current evidence supports the natural emer gence of SARS -CoV-2 via a bat and possible intermediate mammal species. Identifyin g the intermediate species between bats and humans would aid in reducing potential spillover from a natural source. Wide sampling of bats, other wild animals, and humans is needed to address the origin of SARS -CoV-2. Genomic s - How does the disease agent compare to previous strains? ..................................................................................17 Current evidence s uggests that SARS -CoV-2 accumulates substitutions and mutations at a similar rate as other coronaviruses. Mutations and deletions in specific portions of the SARS -CoV-2 genome have not been linked to any changes in transmission or disease severity, though modeling work is attempting to identify possible cha nges. Research linking genetic changes to differences in phenotype (e.g., transmissibility, virulence, progression in patients) is needed. Forecasting - What forecasting models and methods exist? ...................................................................................................18 Forecasts differ in how they handle public health interventions such as shelter -in-place orders, and tracking how methods chan ge in the near future will be important for understanding limitations going forward. REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 6/2/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 3 SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Infectious Dose - How much agent will make a healthy individual ill? What do we know? The human infectious dose of severe acute respiratory syndrome coro navirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2) is unknown by all exposure routes. SARS -CoV-2 is the cause of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID -19). Studies from other animal models are used as surrogates for humans. Non-human primates A total dose of approxim ately 700,000 plaque -form ing units (PFU) of the novel coronavirus SARS - CoV-2 infected cynomolgus macaques via combination intratracheal exposure (106 TCID 50 total dose).331 Macaques did not exhibit clinical symptoms , but virus was shed from the nose and throat.331 Rhesus and cynomolgus macaques showed mild to moderate clinical infections at doses of 4.75x106 PFU (SARS -CoV-2 delivered through several routes), while common marmosets developed mild infections when exposed to 1.0x106 PFU intranasally.246 Rhesus macaques are effectively via the ocular conjunctival and intratracheal route at a of approximately 700,000 PFU (106 TCID 50).112 Rhesus macaque s infected with 50 SARS -CoV-2 by the intranasal, intratracheal, oral and ocular routes combined recapitulate moderate disease observed in the m ajority of human cases.280 African green monkeys developed symptoms consistent with severe human disease when exposed to 500,000 PFU of SARS -CoV-2 via the intranasal and intratracheal routes.400 Rodents Golden Syrian hamsters exposed to 80,000 TCID 50 (~56,000 PFU) via the intranasal route developed clinical symptoms reminiscent of mild human infections (all hamsters infected).351 Golden Syrian hamsters infected with 100,000 PFU via the intranasal route closely resemble human respiratory infection. Uninfected hamsters in close contact with infected hamsters show symptoms within 4 days of exposure. 72 Mice genetically modified to express the human ACE2 receptor ( transgenic hACE2 mice) were inoculated intranasally with TCID 50 (~70,000 PFU), and all mice developed pathological symptoms consistent with COVID -19.28 Transgenic (hACE2) mice became infected after timed aerosol exposure (36 TCID 50/minute) to between 9 00 and 1080 TCID 50 (~630 -756 PFU). All mice (4/4) exposed for 25 -30 minutes became infected, while no mice (0/8) became infected after exposure for 0 -20 minutes (up to 720 TCID 50, ~504 PFU).29 Key methodological details (e.g., particle size, quantification of actual aerosol dose) are missing from the study's report. Other animal models Ferrets i nfected with 50195 of SARS -CoV-2 by the intranasal route show similar symptoms to human disease.195, 324 Uninfected ferrets in direct contact with infected ferrets test p ositive and show disease as early as 2 days post -contact .195 In one study, direct contact was required to transfer infection between ferrets ,195 however , transmission without direct contact was found in another study.324 In a ferret study, 1 in 6 individuals exposed to 102 PFU via the intranasal route became infected, while 12 out of 12 individuals exposed to >104 PFU became infected.337 Domestic cats exposed to 100,000 PFU of SARS -CoV-2 via the intranasal route developed severe pathological symptoms including lesions in the nose, throat, and lungs.349 Related Coronaviruses The infectious dose for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS -CoV-1) in mice is estimated to be between 67 -540 PFU (average 240 PFU, intranasal route).109, 111 Genetically modified mice expressing DPP4 exposed intranasally to doses of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS -CoV) between 100 and 500,000 PFU show signs of infection. Infection with higher doses result in severe syndromes.12, 94, 224, 431 What do we need to know? Identifying the infectious dose for humans by the various routes through which we become infected is critical to the effective development of computational models to predict risk, develop diagnostics and countermeasures, and effective decontamination strategies. Animal studies are a plausible surrogate.

How easily is it spread? What do we know? SARS -CoV-2 is passed easily between humans, likely through close contact with relatively large droplets and possibly through smaller aerosolized particles. Pandemic COVID -19 has caused 6,318,040 infections and 376,885 deaths183 in at least 188 countr ies and territories (as of 6/2/2020 ).62, 344, 394 In the US there are 1,817, 785 confirmed COVID -19 cases across all 50 US states, with 105,475 deaths (as of 6/2/2020 ).183 Initial h igh-quality estimates of human transmissibility (R 0) range from 2.2 to 3.1 .256, 301, 327, 405, 430 SARS- CoV-2 is believed to spread through close contact and droplet tr ansmission,66 with fomite transmission likely186 unconfirmed.392 SARS- CoV-2 replicates in the upper respiratory tract, and infectious virus is detectable in throat and lung tissue for at least 8 days.397 SARS -CoV-2 also infects human gut cell lines ,211 and ocular cells extracted from humans .169 SARS -CoV-2 genetic material has been found in semen from both clinically symptomatic and recovered cases ,223 however, the infectiousness and the possibility of sexual transmission is unknown. Infectious SARS -CoV-2 has been cult ured from patient feces.409 Contamination of patient rooms with aerosolized SARS -CoV-2 in the human respirable range (0.25 - 2.5 m) indicates the potential for airborne transmission .241 Viral RNA was detected up to 4 meters from ICU patient beds.156 To date infectious virus has not been isolated from aerosol samples.341 SARS- CoV-2 may be spread by conversation and exhalation in the absence of cough, however more work is needed.9, 222, 341, 355 A preliminary study in China detail ing a restaurant -associated outbreak supports aerosol transmission , though confirmation is needed.230 Experimentally infected ferrets were able to transmit SARS -CoV-2 to other ferrets by both direct contact (another ferret in same enclosure) as well as through the air (ferret s in an adjacent enclosure, separated by 1 0 cm).324 Similar results have been documented in transgenic mice.29 Evidence suggests that SARS -CoV-2 is not transmitted to infants during birth.78, 83, 86, 343, 416, 420 Individuals can tr ansmit SARS -CoV-2 to others before they have symptoms. Pre-symptomatic354, 433 or asymptomatic26, 167, 250 patients can transmit SARS -CoV-2. At least 12% of all cases are estimated to be due to asymptomatic transmission .118 It has been estimated that 23% ,238 44%,159 or as much as 56%58 of infections may be caused by pre- symptomatic transmission . Infected patients transmit infection s most often before symptoms began and within 5 days of symptom onset ,85 and pre -symptomatic individuals contribute to environmental contamination.184 Individuals may be infectious for 1 -3 days prior to symptom onset ,383 and culturable virus has been found in individuals up to 6 days prior to symptom onset.22 In China, it is estimated that infected individuals transmit COVID -19 to between 11.2%38 and 16.3%227 of household contacts , though even more may lack symptoms .250 In New York, 38% of household contacts of infected patients became infected, w ith the proportion increasing with age (20% for contacts <5 years old, 55% for >65 years old).332 On a cruise ship, 59% of individuals on board tested positive for COVID -19, though the initial number infected was unknown.176 Undetected cases play a major role in transmission, and most cases are not reported. Models suggest up to 86% of early COVID -19 cases in China were undetected, and these infections were the source for 79% of reported cases.226 Models estimate that the true number of cases may be approximately 11 times greater than the reported number of cases in the UK,417 and 5 to 10 times greater than the reported number of cases in the US.187, 336 Preliminary estimates of the case reporting rate vary widely among countries, from roughly 1 reported case for every 3 actual cases (in Germany), to 1 in 149 (in China) .201 Individuals who have recovered clinically, but test positiv e, appear unable to transmit COVID -19. Epidemiological investigations by the Korean CDC suggest that indi viduals who have clinically recovered from COVID -19, but later show PCR positive tests, are not infectious.193 What do we need to know? Identifying the contribution of asymptomatic or pre -symptomatic transmission is important for implementing control measur es. Additionally, the relative contribution s of different infection sources - fomites, droplets, aerosols, and potentially feces - are unknown.

Can it transfer from species to species? What do we know? SARS -CoV-2 is closely related to other coronaviruses circulating in bats in Southeast Asia. Previous coronaviruses have passed through an intermediate mammal host before infecting humans, but the identity of the SARS -CoV-2 intermediate host is unknown. Early genomic analysis indicates similarity to SARS -CoV-1,437 with a suggested bat origin.96, 437 Positive samples from the South China Seafood Market stron gly suggests a wildlife source ,68 though it is possible that the virus was circulating in humans before the disease was associated with the seafood market.31, 97, 411, 421 Analysis of SARS -CoV-2 genomes suggests that a non -bat intermediate species is responsible f or the beginning of the outbreak.330 The identity of the intermediate host remains unknown.229, 233, 235 Viruses similar to SARS -CoV-2 were present in pangolin samples collected several years ago.210 SARS -CoV-2 uses the same receptor for cell entry as the SARS -CoV-1 coronavi rus that circulated in 2002/2003. Experiments show that SARS -CoV-2 Spike (S) receptor- binding domain binds the human cell receptor (ACE2) stronger than SARS -CoV-1,402 potentially explaining its high transmissibility . The same work suggests that differences between SARS -CoV-2 and SARS -CoV-1 Spike proteins may limit the therapeutic ability of SARS antibody treatments.402 Modeling of SARS -CoV-2 Spike and ACE2 proteins suggests that SARS -CoV-2 can bind and infect human, bat, civet, monkey and swine cells.375 Host range predictions based on structural modeling, however, are difficult,137 and additional animal studies are needed to better define the host range . In vitro experiments suggest a broad host range for SARS -CoV-2, with more than 44 potential animal hosts, based on viral binding to species -specific ACE2 orthologs.239 The host range is predicted to be limited primarily to m ammals. Genetic and protein analysis of primates suggests that African and Asian primates are likely more susceptible to SARS -CoV-2, while South and Central American primates are likely less susceptible .269 Identifying the SARS -CoV-2 host range is important for identifying animal reservoirs. Changes in proteolytic cleavage o f the Spike protein can also affect cell entry and animal host range , in addition to receptor binding .270 To date, f errets, mink, hamsters, cats, and primates have been shown to be susceptible to SARS - CoV-2 infection. It is unknown whether these animals can transmit infection to humans. Animal model studies suggest that Golden Syrian hamsters, primates, and ferrets may be susceptible to infection.72, 195 In the Netherlands, farmed mink dev eloped breathing and gastrointestinal issues, which was diagnosed as SARS -CoV-2 infection.2 It is thought that an infected mink has transmitted SARS -CoV-2 to a human.203 Golden Syrian hamsters are able to infect other hamsters via direct contact and close quarters aerosol transmission.351 Domestic cats are susceptible to infection with CoV-2 (100,000- 520,000 PFU via the intranasal route349 or a combination of rou tes157), and can transmit the virus to other cats via droplet or short -distance aerosol.349 Dogs exposed to SARS -CoV-2 produced anti-SARS -CoV-2 antibodies but exhibited no clinical symptoms .349, 352 Wild cats (tigers)382 can be infected with SARS -CoV-2, although their ability to spread to humans is unknown.257, 427 Two cases have been confirmed of pet domestic cats infected with SARS -CoV-2.61 Ducks, chickens, and pigs remained uninfected after experimental SARS- CoV-2 exposure (30,000 CFU for ducks and chickens, 100,000 PFU for pigs, all via intranasal route).349 There is currently no evide nce that SARS -CoV-2 infects livestock ,174 though modeling suggests sheep, cows, pigs, and goats may be susceptible to infection by SARS -CoV-2.209 Pigs and chickens were not susceptible to SARS -CoV-2 infection when exposed to an intranasal dose of 105 TCID 50 (~70,000 PFU), confirmed by lack of positive swab and tissue samples.138 Fruit bats and ferrets were susceptible to this same exposure.138 What do we need to know? Several animal models have been developed to recreate human -like illness, though to date they have been infected with high dose exposures . Lower dose studies may better replicate human disease acquisition . What is the intermediate host(s)? Can infected animals transmit to humans (e.g., pet cats to humans)? Can SARS -CoV-2 circulate in animal reservoir popula tions, potentially leading to future spillover events?

Are people infectious during this time? What do we know? The majority of individuals develop symptoms within 14 days of exposure. For most people, it takes at least 2 days to develop symptoms, and on average symptoms develop 5 days after exposure. Incubating individuals can transmit disease for several days before symptom onse t. Some individuals never develop symptoms but can still transmit disease. The best current estimate of the COVID -19 incubation period is 5.1 days, with 99% of individuals exhibiting symptoms within 14 days of exposure.217 Fewer than 2.5% of infected individuals show symptoms sooner than 2 days after exposure.217 Individuals can test positive for COVID -19 even if they lack clinical symptoms.26, 71, 155, 361, 433 Individuals can be infectious while asymptomatic ,66, 333, 361, 433 and asymptomatic and pre - symptomatic individuals have similar amounts of virus in the nose and throat compared to symptomatic patients.22, 194, 440 Peak infectiousness may be during the incubation period, one day before symptoms develop .159 Infecti ous virus has been cultured in patients up to 6 days before the development of symptoms.22 Infectious period is unknown, but possibly up to 10 -14 days .8, 226, 344 Asymptoma tic individuals are estimated to be infectious for a median of 9.5 days.165 On average, there are approximately 4118 to 7.5225 days between symptom onset in successive cases of a single transmission chain (i.e., the serial interval) . Based on data from 339 transmission chains in China, the mean serial in terval is 5.29 days.117 Children are estimated to shed virus for 15 days on average, with asymptomatic individuals shedding virus for less time (11 days) than sy mptomatic individuals (17 days).248 Most hospitalized individuals are admitted within 8 -14 days of symptom onset.435 What do we need to know? The incubation period is well -characterized. Patients may be infectious, however, for days before symptoms develop.

What do we know? Many COVID -19 cases are asymptomatic. Most symptomatic cases are mild, but severe disease can be found in any age group.6 Older individuals and those with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk of serious illness and death. Approximately 18 -31% of patients are asymptomatic throughout the course of their infection .277, 286, 365 These estimates are based on studies that minimize the likelihood of including pre -symptomatic patients, which can obs cure asymptomatic rates.22 The majority of symptomatic COVID -19 cases are mild (81%, n=44,000 cases) .361 Initial COVID -19 symptoms include fever (87.9% overall, but only 44 -52% present with fever initially ),20, 155 cough (67.7% ),155 fatigue, short ness of breath, headache, and reduced lymphocyte count.67, 75, 166 Chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, and loss of taste or smell414 are also possible COVID -19 symptoms.67 The prevalence of GI symptoms varies.140 Neurological symptoms such as agitation and confusion may present with COVID -19,160 and may be more common in severe cases.103 Ocular issues407 and skin lesions may also be sym ptoms of COVID -19.41 Complications include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, 17 -29% of hospitalized patients, leading to death in 4 -15% of cases ),82, 166, 377 pneumonia,297 cardiac injury (20% ),350 secondary infection, kidney damage ,21, 356 arrhythmia, sepsis, and shock.155, 166, 377, 435 Most deaths are caused by respirato ry failure o r respiratory failure combined with heart damage.334 A number of immunological indicators may help identify potentially severe cases.24, 121, 158, 168, 309, 358 Approximately 15% of hospitalized patients are classified as severe,155, 361 and approximately 5% of patients are admitted to the ICU.155, 361 Patient d eterioratio n can be rapid .151 The survival rate of patients requiring mechanical ventilation varies widely (e.g., 35%,173 70%,23 75.5%325). Clotting issues may be associated with severely ill COVID -19 patients197 and those with ARDS.103 COVID -19 patients should be monitored for possible thrombosis.220 COVID -19 patients undergoing unre lated surgical procedures have high levels of postoperative complications and mortality.283 The case fatality rat e varies substantially by patient age and underlying comorbidities. Cardiovascular disease, hypertension,426 diabetes, and respiratory conditions all increase the CFR.267, 361, 435 Hypertension and obesity are comm on in the US140 and contribute to mortality.21, 299 Individuals >60 are at higher risk of death , and the CFR for individuals >85 is between 10 and 27%.361, 435 In a small study, men exhibited more severe symptoms and die d at higher rates than women.185 The effect of comorbidities on the likelihood of severe symptoms is higher for men.271 Deaths due to COVID -19 are underrep orted . In New York City, up to 5,293 (22%) of period -specific excess deaths are unexplained and could be related to the pandemic.291 More work is needed. Additional studies on vulnerable subpopulations are required . African Americans are disproportionately represented in hospitalized populations ,140, 310 despite having similar rates of several underlying conditions as other groups.150 African American communities also contribute disproportionatel y to the number of deaths in the US.275 Pregnant women appear to develop severe symptoms at the same rate as the general population ,81, 190, 423 and current reports suggest no increase in risk of pre -term birth.415 Severe symptoms in pregnant women may be asso ciated with underlying conditions such as obesity.242 Most studies of COVID -19 in pregnancy represent women in later stages of pregnancy. Children are susceptible to COVID -19,116 though generally show milder76, 247 or no symptoms . Between 21 -28% of children may be asymptomatic.247, 302, 312 A detailed study of 100 children with COVID -19 found that 21% were asymptomatic, 58% developed mild illness, 19% had moderate illness, 1% had severe illness, and 1% developed critical illness.302 Severe symptoms in children are possible237 and more likely in those with complex medical histori es.345 Infant deaths have been reco rded.47, 247 Early reports indicate the possibility of rare hyperinflammatory syndromes or shock in children (termed Pediatric Multi -System Inflammatory Syndrome )149 linked to COVID -19 infection.328 The WHO393 and US CDC182 have issued case definitions for this con dition. What do we need to know? The true case fatality rate is unknown, as the exact number of cases is uncertain. Testing priorit ies and case definitions vary by location . The proportion of asymptomatic infections is not known. How long does it take for infected individuals to recover outside of a healthcare setting? What proportion of infected individuals are asymptomatic? Does thi s vary by age, location, or comorbidities?

What do we know? Infected patients show productive immune responses, however more data is neede d. In a limited study (n=9), hospitalized patients shed high levels of infectious virus for 7 days via the nasal -pharyngeal route , 50% of patients produced antibodies within 7 days, and all patients produced antibodies by 14 days. Antibody production did not correlate with lower viral load.397 In a larger study (n=175), most patients developed neutralizing antibodies within 10 -15 days after disease onset. Elderly patients had significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers than younger patients.404 In a separate study, elderly patients also showed higher viral loads than younger patients.364 In a study of 285 COVID -19 patients, 100% developed antiviral immunoglobulin -G within 19 days of symptom onset.243 The neutralizing ability of these antibodies was not t ested.243 In a smaller in vitro study (n=23 patients), levels of antibodies (imm unoglobulins M and G) were positively correlated with SARS -CoV-2 neutralizing ability.364 In a small study (n=26 mild cases), researchers found prolonged persistence of S ARS-CoV-2 antibodies and SARS -CoV-2 RNA for up to 50 days.376 Previous studies on coronavirus immunity suggest that neutralizing antibod ies may wane after several years .52, 406 More data are needed. A smal l subset of COVID -19 patients in China (8%) did not develop a serological response to infection , though the potential for reinfection in these patients is unknown.404 Similarly, between 16.7% (for IgG) and 51.7% (for IgM) of patients in a separate study did not exhibit any immune response, in terms of product ion of those two types of antibodies. 359 In a study of 221 COVID -19 patients, levels of two types of antibodies ( IgM and IgG) were not associated with the severity of symptoms.164 However, in a smaller study, patients with severe disease showed stronger antibody respon ses than those with non -severe symptoms.364 The early recovery phase of COVID -19 patients is characterized by inflammatory immune response,385 suggesting the potential for adverse reactions after clinical improvement. Two studies identified key components of the adaptive immune system (CD4+ T cells) in the major ity of recovered COVID -19 patients, and these cells reacted to SARS -CoV-2 Spike protein.43, 152 These studies also identified Spike protein responses in CD4+ T cells o f ~30 -40% of unexpo sed patients ,152 suggesting some cross -reactivity between other circulating human coronaviruses and SARS- CoV-2.43, 152 The degree of protection provided by cross -reactivity is currently unknown. Currently, there is no evidence that recovered patients can be reinfected with SARS -CoV-2. Two studies suggest limited reinfection potential in macaques. In the first, two ex perimentally infected macaques were not capable of being reinfected 28 days after their primary infection resolved.27 In the second, rhesus macaques exposed to different doses of SARS -CoV-2 via the intranasal and i ntratracheal routes (104 - 106 PFU) developed pathological infection and were protected upon secondary challenge 35 days after initial exposure (little to no clinical symptoms, large reduction in viral titer compared to initial infection). 74 Longer -term research and work in humans still needs to be conducted.74 Ferrets infected with 102-104 PFU were protected from acute lung injury following secondary challenge with SARS -CoV-2 28 days after initial exposure, but they did exhibit clinical symptoms such as lethargy and ruffled fur.337 According to the WHO, there is no evidence of re -infection with SARS -CoV-2 after recovery.216 Patients can test positive via PCR for up to 37 days after symptoms appear ,435 and after recovery and hospital discharge.212 The ability of these individua ls to infect others is unknown. Similarly , there is no evidence that recovered patients are protected against reinfection with SARS - CoV-2.389 Additional research is required before any conclusions can be drawn about the duration of protective immunity after SARS -CoV-2 infection.15 What do we need to know? Understanding the duration of protective immunity is limited by small sample sizes . Animal models are plausible surrogates. Additional research to quantify the risk of reinfection after weeks, month s, and years is needed. How long does the immune response last? Is there evidence of waning immunity? Can humans become reinfected? How does the patient immune response vary by age or disease severity ? How do different components of the immune response con tribute to long -term protection?

When during infection are they effective? What do we know? Diagnosis relies on identifying the genetic signature of the virus in patient nose, throat, or sputum samples. These tests are relatively accurate. Confirmed cases are still underreported. The US CDC has expanded testing criteria to include symptomatic patients at clinician discretion.30 PCR protocols and primers have been widely shared internationally.59, 99, 225, 348, 388, 395 PCR-based diagnostic assays are unable to differentiate between active and inactive virus. A combination of pharyngeal (throat) RT -PCR and chest tomography is the most effective diagnostic criteria (correctly diag noses 91.9% of infections).322 A single throat swab det ects 78.2% infections, and duplicate tests identify 86.2% of infections.322 PCR tests using saliva are at least as effective as those using nasopharyngeal swabs ,79, 408 and may be useful for at-home sampling. Nasal and pharyngeal swabs may be less effective diag nostic specimens than sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage is mixed.397 Combination RT -PCR and serolog y (antibody) testing may increase the ability to diagnose patients with mild symptoms, or identify patients at higher risk of se vere disease.432 Assays targeting antibodies aga inst the nucleocapsid protein (N) instead of the Spike pro tein (S) of SARS- CoV-2 may improve detection .48 The timing of diagnostic PCR tests impacts results. The false -negative rate for RT PCR tests is lowest between 7 and 9 days after exposure, and PCR tests are more lik ely to give fals e-negative results before symptoms begin (within 4 days of exposure) and more than 14 days after exposure.205 These resul ts suggest PCR screening may be ineffective in recently exposed individuals.205 The FDA issued an Emergency Use Authoriza tion for an antigen- based diagnostic assay, limited to use in certified laboratories (clinical laboratory improvement amendments, CLIA).123 The FDA released an Emergency Use Authorization enabling laboratories to develop and use tests in - house for patient diagnosis.128 Tests from the US CDC are available to states.59, 66 Multiple rapid or real-time test kits have b een produced by universities and industry, including the Wuhan Institute of Virology,104 BGI,36 Cepheid,374 Abbot,126 and Mesa Biotech.39 Home tests are being developed; however, none are FDA approved, nor are they useable as a diagnostic.281-282, 300 The US CDC is developing serological tests to determine what proportion of the population has been exposed to SARS- CoV-2. 189 Artificial intelligence algorithms were able to improve the ability of radiologists to distinguish COVID -19 pneumonia from non -COVID -19 pneumonia on chest CT scans.25 Validated serological (antibody) assays are being developed to help determine who has been exposed to SARS -CoV-2. Serological evidence of exp osure does not indicate immunity. Researchers found high specificity in a number of enzyme -linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), though sample sizes for SARS -CoV-2 patients were small. 290 Additional research has shown high variability in the ability of tests (ELISA and lateral flow assays) by different manufacturers to accurately detec t positive and negative cases (sensitivity and specificity, respectively).215, 386 Lateral flow assays may be less reliable than ELISA.10 The FDA has recommended against the use of several dozen serological diagnostic assays based on failure to conform to updated regulatory requirements.125 Researchers have d esigned a standardized ELISA procedure for SARS -CoV-2 serology samples aimed at minimizing false positives and false negatives.198 In one German town, serological testing has been used to identify the percent of the population already exposed to SARS -CoV-2 (14%), which can assist in public health response planning.319 Preliminary serological studies in Santa Clara and Los Angeles, California, estimated that 2.5 -4.1% of the population has already been exposed to SARS -CoV-2 since the first confirmed cases in January,34, 258 which is between 28 and 85 times greater than official repo rts. There are issues, however, with non-random study populations,34 as well as false positi ve rates of the diagnostic tests themselves.258 The false positive rate of the diagnostic assay used may account for a substantial portion of the reported infections, 34 particularly if the true proportion of positive pa tients is low. In New York, initial serological testing indicates that 13.9% of the population has been exposed to COVID -19, approximately 10 times greater than the number of reported cases. 3 This is in line with other underreporting estimates in the US.187, 336 What do we need to know? In general, PCR tests appear to be sensitive and specific, though confirmation of symptoms via chest CT is recommende d. The sensitivity and specificity of serological testing methods is variable, and additional work needs to be done to determine factors that affect test accuracy. How accurate are clinical diagnoses compared to genetic tests? How many serological tests ne ed to be done to obtain an accurate picture of underlying exposure? REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 6/2/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 10 SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Medical Treatments - Are there effective treatments? What do we know? Treatment for COVID -19 is primarily supportive care including ventilation if necessary.155, 259 Numerous clinical trials are ongoing, but results are preliminary.33, 93 Several drugs show efficacy. Two WHO -backed clinical tria ls (Solidarity and Discovery )206 include remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, ritonavir/lopinavir, and ritonavir/lopinavir a nd interferon -beta.206 The WHO has temporarily halted the hydroxychloroquine arm of its Solidarit y trial due to conc erns about adverse patient reactions.146 Remdesivir shows promise for reducing symptom duration in humans .32 Remdesivir can reduce the duration of symptoms in infected individuals, from 15 days to 11 days on average (compared to controls).32 There is a possibility remdesivir may reduce mortality rates , though the result was not statistically significant.32 In this trial, remdesivir was most effective in patients requiring supplemental oxygen (but not mechanical ventilation).32 Remde sivir received an Emergency Use Authorization from FDA.284 A press release summarizing preliminary Phase III trial results (n=584 patients) suggests that a 5 -day course of remdesivir may improve clinical status for patients with mild to mode rate COVID -19.147 Additional data from this trial are needed. In a separate clinical trial of severe COVID -19 patients, the effects of remdesivir were inconclusive due to a limitation in the study s ample size.380 For available patients, remdesivir did not reduce the time to recovery overall, but did show a tendency to reduce symptom duration f or patients given the drug early.380 This trial ended early, reducing its statistical power.380 Hydroxychloroquine is associated with elevated risk of cardiac arrhythmias and provides limited to no clinical benefit at this point in time . Large, randomized clinical trial results are necessary. A large (n=14,888) observational, retrospective study found elevated rates of mortality and cardiac arrythmias in moderately to severely ill COVID -19 patients taking hydroxychloroquine compared to matc hed control groups. 268 This adds to existing studies that have found no benefit of hydroxychloroquine (w ith or without azithromycin)80, 143, 252 -253, 360 as well as cardiac side effects35, 90, 145, 180, 254, 272 and elevated risk of mortality.252 Individuals taking hydroxychloroquine for autoimmune disorders were not protected from COVID -19,144 though sample sizes were limited. Initial results purporting benefits of hydroxy chloroquine and azithromycin142 have been called into question by other researchers171 and the journal's publishing society .178 One small clinical trial (n=62) suggests that hydroxychloroquine can reduce recover y time compared to control group .84 Key details are missing from th is preprint.84 A small retrospective study (n=48) found benefits to hydroxychloroquine, though details on patient study population selec tion were limited.418 Other pharmaceutical interventions are being investigated. A randomized Phase II trial found that a triple combination of interferon beta -1b, lopinavir -ritonav ir, and ribavirin administered early in infection reduced symptom severity, viral shedding, and hospital stay time compared to patients taking lopinavir -ritonavir alone. 172 In a separate study, i nterferon beta -1a w as associated with lower mortality in a small study, but was only tested in combination with other drugs such as lopinavir/ritonavir or hydroxychloroquine.108 Limited, preliminary evidence from clinical trials supports the efficacy of favipiravir77 (which has been approved to treat COVID -19 in China)1 and intravenous immunoglobulin.54 Early r esearch found no efficacy from combination ritonavir and lopinavir ,53 as well as an increase in gastrointestinal symptoms.231 Phase II clinical trial results for the kinase inhibitor Ruxolitinib showed few severe side eff ects and suggested benefits in terms of symptom duration and mortality.55 Larger trials are needed to assess treatment efficacy. Early results from a randomized clinical trial foun d that high doses of chloroquine diphosphate were associated with toxicity and lethality in severely ill patients .40 Efficacy was not assessed.40 A small (n=21) , observatio nal study found benefits of tocilizumab in severe COVID -19 patients .412 Potential b enefits of immunosuppressants7 should be weighed against potential risks .315 The anticoagulant h eparin is being used to mitigate ris ks of pulmonary embolism.121 Systemic anticoagulant use was associated with reduced mortality rates in severely ill patients .298 Passive antibody therapy (convalescent serum )56 is being given to patient s,127 and several small trials suggest benefits from convalescent patient plasma for infected patients.236, 340, 346- 347 What do we need to know?

What do we know? Work is ongoing to develop a SARS -CoV-2 vaccine in human and animal trials. Early results are being released, but evidence should be considered preliminary until larger trials are completed . Multiple entities are working to p roduce a SARS -CoV-2 vaccine,16 including HHS/NIH/NIAID,161, Sciences,4-5, 285 Sanofi,42 and Johnson and Johnson.188 Vaccine candidates undergoing clinical trial are liste d below. Phase II Trials (initial testing for efficacy, continued testing for safety) : China's CanSino is the first to complete Phase I safety trials of their adenovirus type 5 vector based SARS- CoV-2 vaccine, Ad5 -nCoV, and has advanced to Phase II human tr ials.232 University of Oxford's ChAdOx1 candidate has begun Phase II/III human trials.295 Phase I Trials (initial testing for safety) : Sinovac Biotech has reported that their inactivated virus vaccine shows protective effects in rhesus macaques, particularly at high doses.139 The vaccine is currently in Phase I clinical trial s.95 Phase I trial results for the CanSino vaccine (Ad5 -nCoV) showed few severe adverse reactions in humans within 28 days of follow -up (side effects include d fever [sometimes severe], fatigue, headache, and muscle pain).438 Immune responses were found in most patients, peaking at 14 days for T -cells and 28 days for antibodies.438 Two doses w ere selected for human Phase II trials. Vaccine efficacy in humans is currently unknown.438 Moderna has a Phase I trial underway based on its mRNA platform, mRNA -1273. Preliminary data from the trial suggests that the vaccine is well -tolerated by human subjects, a nd induces an antibody response against SARS -CoV-2.278 Results from trials designed to test efficacy are needed. Inovio had their IND approved by the FDA and have started their Phase I clinical trials on their DNA vaccine candidate INO -4800.338 Shenzhen Geno -Immune Medical Institute is testing its aAPC265 and lentiviral263 vaccines in Phase I clinical trials . BioNTech and Pfizer 's BNT162 program is in Phase I/ II clinical trial for four of its mRNA vaccine candidates.308 Univ ersity of Oxford 's ChAdOx1 vaccine is in Phase I clinical trials. This vaccine is based on a chimpanzee adenovirus expressing S ARS- CoV-2 proteins.307 The ChAdOx1 platform has shown protective efficacy in rhesus macaques in preclinical trials. Safety and efficacy still need to be determined in human trials.371 The Beijing Institute of Biological Products /Wuhan Institute of Biological Products have initiated a Phase I trial of their inactivated vaccine candidate.396 Symvivo Corporation has received approval to begin a Phase I trial with their oral bacTRL -Spike vaccine candidate in Canada.261 Novavax is testing a recombinant spike protein n anoparticle vaccine in Phase I trials.262 Immunitor LLC is starting Phase I trials of a heat -inacti vated vaccine derived from pooled patient plasma.266 Aivita Biomedical will begin a Phase Ib/II randomized double -blind clinical trial of 180 people, specifically healthcare workers and first responders.

What do we know? Broad- scale control measures such as stay -at-home orders are effective at reducing movement and contact rates , and modeling shows evidence that they reduce transmission. Social distancing and other policies are estimated to have reduced COVID-1 9 spread by 44% in Hong Kong102 and reduced spread throughout China200, 204, 208, 244, 255 and Italy.141 Restrictive lockdowns in China are estimated to have reduced disease transmission within only a few days,439 in part, through reductions in an i ndividual's average number of contacts.424 Modeling de monstrates that multifaceted restrictions and quarantines in China reduced the R0 of SARS -CoV-2 from greater than 3 to less than 1 between January 23 and F ebruary 5.296 Additionally, movement restrictions and other control measures helped limit the amount of time where community transmission was possible (i.e., R0 > 1).425 A US county-l evel model found that shelter in place orders (SIPOs) and restaurant and bar closures were associated with large reductions in exponential growth rate of cases.100 School closures and cancellation of large gatherings had smaller e ffects.100 Similarly, researchers found that a l arger number of public health interventions in place was strongly associated with lower COVID-1 9 growth rates in the next week.191 Mobility134, 214 and physical contact rates181 decline after public health control measures are implemented. Modeling suggests that on their own, travel restrictions are ineffective at reducing COVID-1 9 spread and only de lay peak prevalence by only a few days but do not limit epidemic size.14 Model s indicate that a combination of school closures, work restrictions, and other measures are required to effectively limit transmission.131 School closures alone appear insufficient.179, 208 Non-pharmaceutical interventions in China did not reduce transmission equally across all groups; transmission rates in younger individuals, particularly i nfants, as well as hospital workers continued to increase even while overall transmission rates declined.296 Contact tracing to identify i nfected individuals reduces the amount of time i nfectious individuals can transmit disease in a population and increases the time between successive cases.38 Robust contact tracing and case finding may be needed to control COVID-1 9 in the US, but would require additional staff and resources to conduct e ffectively.381 Th e effect of relaxing control measures is unknown, and research is needed to help plan for easing of restrictions. Modeling suggests that 2 0-30 US states still have self -sustained COVID -19 transmission (R 0 > 1) as of 5/17/ 2020.367 The same work estimates that ver y few individuals have been infected overall (4.3% estimated prevalence), even in states with large case and fatality totals (e.g., 16.6% of New York residents).367 Relaxation of public health interventions is projected to increase cases and deaths.105, 367 Mo deling indicates that COVID -19 is likely to become end emic in the US population, with regular, periodic outbreaks, and that additional social or physical distancing measures may be required forseveral years to keep cases below critical care capacity in absence of a vaccine or effective therapeutic. 196 Results depend critically on the duration of immunity after exposure.196 Tw o modeling studies suggest that co ntact tracing combined with high levels of testing may be capable of limiting the potential for large second waves of COVID -19 transmission once initial social distancing policies are relaxed.13, 132 In the UK, modelers are assessing the efficacy of rolling interventions, whereby social distancing measures are put into place every few weeks to keep healthcare demand bel ow a critical point.417 A modeling study using Chinese data suggests that carefully balancing control measures to maintain R0 below 1 would be more efficient than allowing R 0 to increase above 1 at any point .218 The WHO has released guidelines on public health strategy,387 and Johns Hopkins released a report outlining how to re -open certain categories of activities (e.g., schools, restaurants, events) while reducing COVID -19 risk .329 What do we need to know? As different US states have implemented differ ing control measures at various times, a comprehensive analysis of social distancing efficacy has not yet been conducted.

What do we know? SARS -CoV-2 can persist on surfaces for at least 3 days and on the surface of a surgical mask for up to 7 days depending on conditions. If aerosolized intentionally, SARS -CoV-2 is stable for at least several hours. The seasonality of COVID -19 transmission i s unknown. SARS -CoV-2 on surfaces is inactivated rapidly with sunlight. SARS -CoV-2 Data In simulated saliva on stainless steel surface , SARS -CoV-2 exhibits negligible decay over 60 minutes in darkness, but loses 90% of infectivity every 6.8 -12.8 minutes, depending on the intensity of simulated UVB radiation levels .318 SARS- CoV-2 can persist on plastic and metal surfaces between 3 days ( 21-23\u00b0C, 40% RH)369 and 7 days (22 \u00b0C, 65% RH). Infectious virus can be recovered from a surgical mask after 7 days (22\u00b0 C, 65% RH).89 SARS- CoV-2 has an aerosol half -life of 2.7 hours (particles <5 m, tes ted at 21 -23\u00b0C and 65% RH).369 SARS- CoV-2 is susceptible to heat treatment (70 \u00b0C) but can persist for at least two weeks at refrigerated t emperatures (4 \u00b0C).89, 317 SARS- CoV-2 genetic material (RNA) was detected in symptomatic and asymptomatic cruise ship passenger rooms up to 17 days after cabins were vacated . The infectiousness of this material is not known.279 In a preliminary study, SARS -CoV-2 stability was enhanced when present with bovine serum albumin, which is commonly used to represent sources of protein found in human sputum.303 No strong evidence exists showing a reduction in transmission with seasonal increase in temperature and humidity.249 Model ing suggests that even accounting for potential reductions in transmission due to weather and behavioral changes, public health int erventions will still need to be in effect to limit COVID -19 transmission.273 The Department of Hom eland Security ( DHS) developed a data -based model for SARS -CoV-2 decay on inert surfaces ( stainless steel and ABS plastic) at varying temperature and relative humidity. This model estimate s virus decay in the absence of exposure to direct sunlight.114 A recent study determined that approximately 0.1 -1% of initial SARS -CoV-2 inoculated on plastic, stainless steel , glass, ceramics, wood, latex gloves, cotton, paper , and surgical masks remained after 48 hours.240 Approximat ely 0.1% of SARS -CoV-2 remains in fec al matter after 6 hours .240 Approximately 0.1% of SARS -CoV-2 in human urine persists after 4 -5 days.240 RNA in clinical samples collected in viral transport medium is stable at 18 -25\u00b0C or 2-8\u00b0C for up to 21 days without impacting real -time RT -PCR results.353 RNA in c linical samples is also stable at 4 \u00baC for up for 4 weeks with regard to quantitative RT -PCR testing (given that the sample contains 5,000 copies/mL). Separately, storage of RNA in PBS at room -temperature (18 -25\u00b0C) resulted in unstable sample concentrations.305 Surrogate Coronavirus data : Studies suggest that other coronaviruses can survive on non- porous surfaces up to 9 -10 days (MHV, SARS- CoV) ,57, 73 and porous surfaces for up to 3 -5 days (SARS -CoV)120 in air con ditioned environments (20 -25\u00b0C, 40- 50% RH). Coronavirus survival tends to be higher at lower temperatures and lower relative humidity (RH),57, 73, 314, 370 though infectious virus can persist on surfaces for severa l days in typical office or hospital conditions .370 SARS can persist with trace infectivity for up to 28 days at refrigerated temperatures (4 \u00b0C) on surfaces.57 One hour after aerosolization approximately 63% of airborne MERS virus remained viable in a simulated office environment (25 \u00b0C, 75% RH) . 311 Porous hospital materials, including paper and cotton cloth, maintain infectious SARS -CoV for a shorter time than non -porous material.207 What do we need to know? Additional testing on SARS -CoV-2, as opposed to surrogate viruses, is needed to support initial estimates of stability.

SARS-CoV-2 Alcohol -based hand rubs are effective at inactivating SARS -CoV-2.202 Chlorine bleach (1%, 2%), 70% ethanol and 0.05% chlorhexidine are effective against live virus in lab tests.88 Twice -daily cleaning with sodium dichloroi socyanurate decontaminated surfaces i n COVID -19 patient hospital rooms.292 EPA has released a list of SARS -CoV-2 disinfectants, but solutions were not tested on live virus.11 Other Coronaviruses Chlorine -based391 and ethanol -based98 solutions are recommended. Heat treatment (56 \u00b0C) is sufficient to kill coronaviruses,314, 434 though effectiveness depends partly on pro tein in the sample.314 70% ethanol, 50% isopropanol, sodium hypochlorite radiation and CCV).339 Ethanol -based biocides effectively disinfect coronaviruses dried on surfaces, including ethanol containing gels similar to hand sanitizer.170, 398 Surface spray disinfectants suc h as Mikrobac, Dismozon, and Korsolex are effective at reducing infectivity of the closely related SARS -CoV-1 after 30 minutes of contact.313 Coronaviruses may be resistant to heat inactivation for up to 7 days when stabilized in stool.362-363 Coronaviruses are more stable in matrixes such as respiratory sputum.119 Methods for decontaminating N95 masks have been approved by the FDA under an E mergency U se Authorization (EUA). Researchers have identified four methods capable of decontaminating N9 5 respirators while maintaining physical integrity (fit factor): UV radiation, heating to 70 \u00b0C, and vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP).133 Ethanol (70% ) was associated with loss of physical integrity.133 Hydrogen peroxide vapor (VHP) can repeatedly decontaminate N95 respirators.326 Devices capable of decontaminating 80,000 masks per day have been granted Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA.123 The FDA has issued a n Emergency Use Authorization for a system capable of decontaminating 10 N95 masks at a time using devices already present in many US hospitals.44 What do we need to know?

REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 6/2/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 15 SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) PPE - What PPE is effectiv e, and who should be using it? What do we know? The effectiveness of PPE for SARS -CoV-2 is currently unknown, and data from other related coronaviruses are used for guidance. Healthcare workers are at high risk of acquiring COVID -19, even with recommended PPE. Healthcare worker illnesses361 demonstrates human -to-human transmission despite isolation, PPE, and infe ction control.342 Risk of transmission to healthcare workers is high, with up to 20% of healthcare workers in Lombardy, Italy becoming infected.321 Over 50% of US healthcare workers infected with COVID -19 report work in a healthcare setting as their single source of exposure .49 \"Healthcare personnel entering the room [of SARS -CoV-2 patients] should use standard precautio ns, contact pr ecautions, airborne precautions, and use eye protection (e.g., goggles or a face shield) .\"64 WHO indicates healthcare workers should wear clean long -sleeve gowns as well as gloves.390 Clothing and PPE that covers all sk in may reduce exposure to pathogens.130, 384 Respirators (NIOSH -certified N95, EUFFP2 or for those dealing with possible aerosols .391 Additional protection, such as a Powered Air Purify ing Respirator (PAPR) with a full hood, should be considered for high- risk procedures (i.e., intubation, ventilation) .46 Particular attention should be paid to the potential for transmission via exhaled air during supportive respiratory procedures.154 KN95 respirators are, under certain conditions, approved for use under FDA Emergency Use Authorization.124 On May 7, the FDA rescinded a number of KN95 models that no longer meet the EUA criteria and are no longer authorized .129 A study suggests that P100 respirators wit h removable filter cartridges have similar filtration efficiency compared to N95 respirators and could plausibly be used if N95 respirato rs were in short supply. The study used an experimental setup with aerosolized simulant, not human testing.304 Masks may be effective at slowing transmission . On 4/3/2020, the US CDC recommended wearing cloth face masks in public where social distancing measures are difficult to main tain.65 A meta -analysis of SARS, MERS, and COVID -19 transmission events found evidence that wearing face masks and eye protection were each associated with lower risk of transmission.91 N95 respirators were associated with a larger reduction in transmission risk compared to surgical face masks.91 Physical distance (>1 or 2 meters) was also associated with lower transmission risk .91 In a separate meta -analysis, N95 respirators were found to be beneficial for reducing the occurrence of respiratory illness in health care professionals including influenza, though surgical masks were similarly effective for influenza.289 N95 respirators were associated with large reductions (up to 80%) in SARS -CoV-1 infections.289 A non-peer -reviewed report of experimental tria l with hamsters suggests that surgical masks may reduce SARS -CoV-2 transmission via aerosol when the mask material is used as a filter between separate cages housing infected and uninfected hamsters .162 Surgical face masks, res pirators and homemade face masks may prevent transmission of coronaviruses from infectious individuals (with or without symptoms) to other individuals .107, 219, 368 Surgical masks were associated with a significant reduction in the amount of seasonal coronavirus (not SARS -CoV-2) expressed as aerosol particles (<5 m) compared to not wearing a mask.219 The efficacy of homemade PPE, made with T -shirts, bandanas, or similar materials, is less than standard PPE, but may offer some protection if no other options are available.92, 106, 323 The filtering efficiency of homemade mask materials is variable. Some non -stand ard materials (e.g., cotton, cotton hybrids) may be able to filter out >90% of simulant particles >0.3 m,199 while other materials (e.g., T -shirt, vacuum cleaner bag, towels) appear to have lower filtration efficacy (~35 -62%).378 What do we need to know? Most PPE recommendations have not been made on SARS -CoV-2 data, and comparative efficacy of different PPE for different tasks (e.g., intubation) is unknown. Identification of efficacious PPE for healthcare worker s is critical due to their high rates of infection. What is the importance of aerosol transmiss ion (particles <5 m)? What is the effective distance of spread via droplet or aerosol? How effective are barriers such as N95 respirators or surgical masks for SARS -CoV-2? What is the appropriate PPE for first responders? Airport screeners? What are proper procedures for r educing spread and transmission rates in medical facilities? How effective are homemade masks at reducing SARS -CoV-2 transmission?

Tests to be used for attribution. What do we know? All curre nt evidence supports the natural emergence of SARS -CoV-2 via a bat and possible intermediate mammal species. Genomic analysis places SARS -CoV-2 into the beta -coronavirus clade, with close relationship to bat coronaviruses. The SARS -CoV-2 virus is distinct from SARS -CoV-1 and MERS viruses.115 Genomic analysis suggest s that SAR S-CoV-2 is a natural variant and is unlikely to be human- derived or otherwise created by \"recombination\" with other circulating strains of coronavirus.17, 437 Genomic data support at least two plausible origins of SARS -CoV-2: \"(i) natural selection in a non - human animal host prior to zoonotic transfer, and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.\"17 Both scenarios are consistent with the observ ed gen etic changes found in all known SARS- CoV-2 isolates. Some SARS- CoV-2 genomic evidence indicates a close relationship with pangolin coronaviruses ,399 and data suggest that pangolins may be a natural host for beta -coronaviruses .233, 235 Genomic evidence suggests a plausible recombination event between a circulating coronavirus in pangolins and bat s could be the source of SARS -CoV-2.410 Emerging studies are showing that bats are not the only reservoir of SARS -like coronaviruses.428 Additional research is neede d. There are multiple studies showing that the SARS -CoV-2 S protein receptor binding domain, the portion of the protein responsible for binding the human receptor ACE2, was acquired through recombination between coronaviruses from pangolins and bats.18, 228, 234, 428 These studies suggest that pangolins may have played an intermediate role in the adaptation of SARS -CoV-2 to be able to bind to th e human ACE2 receptor. Additional research is needed. A novel bat coronavirus (RmYN02) has been identified in China with an i nsertion in the viral furin cleavage site. While distinct from the insertion in SARS -CoV-2, this evidence shows that such insertion s can occur naturally.436 Additionally, \"[...] SARS -CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone,\" reducing the likelihood of laboratory origination,17 and \"[...] genomic evidence does not support the idea that SARS- CoV-2 is a laboratory construct, [though] it is currently impossible to prove or disprove the other theories of its origin.\"17 Work with other coronaviruses h as indicated that heparan sulfate dependence can be an indicator of prior cell passage, due to a mutation in the previous furin enzyme recognition motif.110 What do we need to know? Identifying the intermediate species between bats and humans would aid in reducing potential spillover from a natural source. Wide sampling of bats, other wild animals, and humans is needed to address the origin of SARS -CoV-2. What tests for attribution exist for coronavirus emergence? What is the identity of the interme diate species? Are there closely related circulating coronaviruses in bats or other animals with the novel PRRA cleavage site found in SARS -CoV-2? REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 6/2/2020 CLEAR ED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 17 SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Genomics - How does the disease agent compare to previous strains? What do we know ? Current evidence suggests that SARS -CoV-2 accumulates substitutions and mutations at a similar rate as other coronaviruses. Mutations and deletions in specific portions of the SARS -CoV-2 genome have not been linked to any changes in transmission or disea se severity , though modeling work is attempting to identify possible changes . There have been no documented cases of SARS -CoV-2 prior to December 2019 . Preliminary genomic analyses, however, suggest that the first human cases of SARS -CoV-2 emerged between 10/19/2019 -12/17/2019.19, 31, 316 Ana lysis of more than 7,000 SARS -CoV-2 genome samples provides an estimated mutation rate of 6x10-4 nucleotides per genome per year.372 The sa me analysis estimates the emergence of SARS - CoV-2 in humans between October and December 2019.372 This aligns with the first known human cases in China in early December 2019 , in Europe in late December 2019,113 and circulation in the US (Washington State) in February 2020 .401 Despite evidence of variat ion in the genome70 and areas under positi ve selection,50 there are no known association s between particular mutations and changes in transmission or virulence.51 Thus, there is currently no evidence of distinct SARS -CoV-2 phenotypes at this time .251, 372 Research attempting to define clades or subgroups of SARS -CoV-2 based solely o n genomic features has suffered from limited data422 and sampling bias.136 Anal ysis shows that no recurrent SARS -CoV-2 mutations are associa ted with increases in viral transmission, providing no evidence of distinct lineage with different rates of growth.373 In 94 COVID -19 patients where both symptoms and genetic sequences of SARS -CoV-2 were known, there was no association between viral genotype and clinical severity.429 SARS- CoV-2 is acquiring nucleotide changes at a rate that suggests the virus is undergoing purifying selection (that the genome is stabilizing toward a common genome).403 Low genetic diversity early in the epidemic suggests that SARS -CoV-2 was capable of jumping to human and other mammalian hosts,403 and that additional jumps into humans from reservoir species may occur. Pangolin coronavirus es are closely related to both SARS -CoV-2 and closely related b at coronaviruses . Phylogenetic analysis suggests that SARS -CoV-2 is of bat origin, but is closely related to pangolin coronavi rus.233, 235 The SARS -CoV-2 Spike protein , which mediates entry into host cells and is the major determinant of host range, is very similar to the SARS -CoV-1 Spike protein .245 The rest of the genome is more closely related to two separate bat245 and pangolin235 coronavirus es. An a nalysis of SARS -CoV-2 sequences from Singapore has identified a l arge nucleotide (382 bp) deleti on in ORF -8.357 In Arizona, researchers identified an 81 -base pair deletion (removing 27 amino acids) in the ORF -7a protein, i ndicating that mutations can be detected by routine sentinel surveillance. The function of these deletions are unknown at this time.163 A recent report of virus mutations within patients needs more research.192 Additional analysis of data suggests the results may be due to experimental methods.148, 413 Structural modeling sugg ests that observed changes in the genetic sequence of the SARS -CoV-2 Spike protein m ay enhance binding of the virus to human ACE2 receptors.293 More specifically, changes to two residues (Q493 and N501) are linked with improving the stability of the virus - receptor binding complex.293 Additionally, structural modeling identified several existing mutations that may enhance the stability of the receptor binding domain, potentially increasing binding efficacy.294 Infectivity assays a re needed to validate the genotypic changes and possible phenotypic results identified in these studies. A key difference between SARS -CoV-2 and other beta -coronaviruses is the presence of a polybasic furin cleavage site in the Spike protein (insertion of a PRRA amino acid sequence between S1 and S2).101 The US CDC is la unching a national genomics consortium to assess SARS -CoV-2 genomic changes over time.60 What do we need to know? Research linking genetic changes to differences in phenotype (e.g., transmissibility, virulence, progression in patients) is needed. Are there similar geno mic differences in the progression of coronavirus strains from bat to intermediate species to human? Are there different strains or clades of circulating virus? If so, do they differ in virulence? What are the mutations in SARS -CoV-2 that allowed human inf ection and transmission?

Fundamentally uses an SEIR model fit to observed data.288 What do we need to know? Forecasts differ in how they handle public health interventions such as shelter -in-place orders and tracking how methods change in the near future will be importa nt for understanding limitations going forward.
