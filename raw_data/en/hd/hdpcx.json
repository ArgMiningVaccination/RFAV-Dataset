The results indicate that acriterion group ofthose finally selected for thespecial mission was better able toadapt to thetwocompeting tasks andwasless susceptible tothesignal/noise ambiguity andtheinduced task stress than mission group asawhole.

Repeated tilttable tests, using anEnglish-saddle type ofsupport, were conducted before and after theperiod ofrecumbency todetermine the response ofthe subjects. Radioisotope blood volume determinations were made prior tothe study, during the study, and during the recovery phase. These tests were performed inconjunction with astudy designed primarily toevaluate the rnusculoskeletal changes that occurasaconsequence ofprolonged bed rest. The results indicate that definite cardiovascular decondi- tioning occurs after 30days ofbed restand that almost complete recovery isachieved after two weeks ofambulatory activity. The study also demonstrates that blood volume decreases inthefirst fewdays ofbed rest and returns toward normal attheend ofthe 30-day bed rest period.
