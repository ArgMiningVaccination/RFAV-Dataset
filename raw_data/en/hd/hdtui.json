Over \u00a3500 million of this in 1999-2000 funded research andresearch facilities in 83 Public Sector Research Establishments (\"ResearchEstablishments\"), 59 of which are grouped together under seven ResearchCouncils. The Councils are Non-Departmental Public Bodies brigaded underthe Office of Science and Technology, which is part of the Department of Tradeand Industry (the \"Department\") (see Figure 1) . The Research Councils cover broad scientific streams and provide funding and strategic direction for theirResearch Establishments along the lines illustrated by Figure 2 . 1 Source: Department of Trade and IndustryThe relationships between the DTI and its Research Establishments Department of Trade and Industry (Permanent Secretary & Accounting Officer) Office of Science and Technology (Director General of the Research Councils)Office of Science and Technology (Chief Scientific Adviser and Head of the Office of Science and Technology) BBSRC Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council PPARC Particle Physics and Astronomy Research CouncilEPSRC Engineering and Physical Sciences Research CouncilESRC Economic and Social Research CouncilCCLRC Council for the Central Laboratory of the Research CouncilsMRC Medical Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council2executive summaryDELIVERING THE COMMERCIALISATION OF PUBLIC SECTOR SCIENCE 2 The vital core role of the Research Establishments, and the scientists who staff them, is to conduct research in support of the public interest including: !achieving advances in science, which receives the majority of funding; !informing government policy-making through the provision of comprehensive scientific data and independent advice; !training the next generation of research scientists; and !assisting public sector bodies carry out their statutory or regulatory functions. 3 Many of the Research Establishments are internationally acknowledged centres of excellence in their field. The Medical Research Council claims thirteenNobel prize winners since 1952, ten of them scientists from the MedicalResearch Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, world leaders in researchon the structure of biological systems relevant to human disease. Many performcritical advisory roles, such as the Institute for Animal Health, which has playeda major role in combating the recent outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease,including extensive testing and analysis. 4 Although the United Kingdom has a strong record in innovation, it is widely considered to have been less successful in capturing the economic benefits ofscientific advances. The ability to capture such benefits - in particular thecreation of novel products and processes - could have a significant impact onthe competitiveness and growth of the UK economy. For this reason, withoutwanting to compromise the Research Establishments' core scientific role, theGovernment is keen to encourage them, in co-operation with the private sector,to apply the outputs of publicly funded scientific research to stimulateeconomic and social benefits, such as job creation, increased prosperity andenhanced quality of life. This is termed \"commercialisation\". We describedifferent forms of commercialisation of research outputs in Figure 5 (page 15). An early example of successful commercialisation of research is Celltech, abiotechnology company created in 1980 which employed total staff of 1,803 inthe year to 31 December 2000, including some 1,150 research and marketingstaff in the United Kingdom and abroad. This was built on science originatingin Medical Research Council laboratories.

In line with this we have examined the capacity of the ResearchEstablishments to meet the challenges arising from increasing commercialisationto deliver the potential economic and social benefits for the nation. Ourmethodology is described in detail in Appendix 1 - in brief, we considered: !the key importance of building an enabling culture, capable of encouraging and stimulating effective commercialisation; !whether Research Establishments are identifying and putting in place the capabilities required; and !how Research Establishments can best realise the potential benefits of commercialisation. 6 We focused our investigation on the 53 Research Establishments within three Research Councils for which the Department for Trade & Industry hasresponsibility - the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, theMedical Research Council and the Natural Environment Research Council. Thisis because these Research Councils have differing potential for commercialisationso that the collective experience of their Research Establishments is likely to beof relevance to the others. Together, the Research Establishments covered by thesethree Research Councils received funding of about \u00a3443 million in 1999-2000.This study has been carried out in parallel with another National Audit Officereport that considers the commercialisation of research sponsored by theDepartment for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs which is expected to bepublished later in 2002. With committed leadership, Research Establishments can meet the challenges ofcommercialisation 7 Our examination has shown that where there has been committed and effective leadership at both senior and middle management level there has beensignificant progress in constructing commercialisation deals with the privatesector. Leadership has been a major factor in the fostering of a culture thatpromotes commercialisation - a prerequisite for success - and has built thecapabilities needed to support this culture, without compromising the corepublic service role in scientific research. 8 The Medical Research Council has been particularly successful in building on intellectual property arising in its Research Establishments (which it calls units).Active leadership from senior staff in the Medical Research Council led to thecreation of Medical Research Council Technology Ltd (Medical ResearchCouncil Technology) which has been allocated sufficient resources to lead thecommercialisation research outputs for all Medical Research Council units. The Medical Research Council was also instrumental in the creation of MVM Limited, a venture capital company managed by individuals from theprivate sector. This has two funds which invest in early stage life sciencecompanies, the first, UK Medical Ventures Fund, raised \u00a340 million in 1998and the second fund raised a similar amount in October 2001.DELIVERING THE COMMERCIALISATION OF PUBLIC SECTOR SCIENCE 9 Other Research Establishments have also demonstrated leadership by obtaining funds to develop commercialisation activity. The Biotechnology and BiologicalSciences Research Council sponsored Babraham Institute, for example,competitively obtained a \u00a3250,000 grant from the Department to refurbishlaboratory and support facilities appropriate for use by early stage companies.This attracted 19 fledgling companies to rent about 3,000 square metresof space at their suitably named 'Bio-incubator' site andgenerated \u00a3680,000 from rents and services in2000-01. Implementing this relatively smallinitiative provided funds to hirequalified people and helped to buildan effective framework forcommercialisation activity. Thishas since led on to a larger publicprivate partnership project, withsimilar aims, at the Babraham site. Without enabling cultures, effectivecommercialisation isnot possible 10 The traditional focus in Research Establishments is, rightly, on producing thehighest quality scientific research and advice. To meetthe increasing emphasis on commercialisation, a culturethat is also supportive of commercial activity, which helps staff toovercome barriers, such as the lack of recognition forcommercialisation work, is needed. This will require change inmany Research Establishments. There are already good examples ofsuch support as in our case example of Evolutec, a company set upto exploit research by Professor Nuttall at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology to develop more effective treatment of complaintssuch as asthma than are currently available (paragraphs 2.15 and 4.3). This Research Establishment is a component of the Natural Environment Research Council and senior management at theResearch Council, particularly Professor Sir John Krebs (ChiefExecutive until September 1999) and Dr Tricker, played animportant role in encouraging Professor Nuttall to take the workforward and in finding some funding, in the absence of anestablished budget for early stage work. As a result of thisexperience the Natural Environment Research Council has nowestablished a \u00a3500,000 innovation fund for providing financialsupport from the centre for such developments. 11 Effective accountability of Research Establishments' commercial performance through relevant performance targets, objectives andreview will also encourage change. These should recognise that notall commercial initiatives can be successful and that lessons can belearned from studying successes and failures. The Government has set a highlevel target to 'increase the level of exploitation of technological knowledgederived from the science and engineering base, as demonstrated by a significantrise in the proportion of innovating business citing such sources.' 4executive summary DELIVERING THE COMMERCIALISATION OF PUBLIC SECTOR SCIENCE 12 The Office of Science and Technology is revising the performance indicators that apply to Research Councils to reflect this high level target. These indicatorscurrently include measures such as the level of income received from the privatesector, the number and value of collaborative or co-funded research projects andthe number of co-publications with industry. Such broad measures are of use in assessing the level of interaction with the private sector although they are not specific measures of Research Establishments' performance in commercialising their research outputs. The Office of Science and Technology would like Research Councils to set performance indicators for their Research Establishments which are consistent with their overall targets. It emphasises, however, that its role is to influence targets rather than to set them. 13 Medical Research Council Technology has prioritised its objectivesfor commercial activity in the light of thepolicy aim of capturing economic and social benefits and the mission of the Medical Research Council: !to choose the most suitable commercial arrangement and the partner(s) judged most likely to develop Medical Research Council technology into products and services useful to society; !to maximise the contribution to national wealth creation and UK industrial competitiveness; and !to maximise income to the Medical Research Council in the medium to long-term. This hierarchy of objectives provides a clear context for decision makers to assess commercial activity and is likely to stimulate long term types of commercial activity, as opposed to potential short term objectives such as maximising income from the private sector. The establishment of such a framework may assist Research Establishments in deciding on the forms of commercial activity in which to engage. 14Encouraging scientists to engage actively in commercialisation is vital to ensuring continuing success. Giving adequate weight to commercialisation activity in performance assessments is likely to be an effective incentive for many scientists. Our survey indicated, however, that this is frequently not done. There is often a perceived conflict between the confidentiality required by commercial activity and the desire to publish research results, on which the performance assessments of scientists are largely based. Our survey also indicated that scientists did not see financial incentives as a main motivating factor. But there is anecdotal evidence from many of those who participated in this study that visible evidence of the positive impact of incentives oncolleagues did change attitudes. The impact of the awards to inventors schemesand the scope for staff to act as company founders were thought to beparticularly important. A recent innovative example comes from the HumanReproductive Science Unit where a number of scientists have been given theopportunity to take equity stakes in a spin out company specialising inwomen's health (Figure 8) and this, in conjunction with the input of market knowledge from the private sector, is linked to an upsurge in commercialactivity. It appears, therefore, that scientists' involvement can be stimulated andrewarded through the provision of fair and effective incentives. 5executive summary 6executive summary15 Scientists do not generally have business training and cannot be expected routinely to display or to acquire the full range of commercial skills required tocommercialise their research. Our work points to the benefits of offeringincentives to scarce professional commercial staff who also have a key role toplay in successful commercialisation activity. They bring to bear business andintellectual property management knowledge allied to the commercialexperience to assess opportunities realistically and to negotiate successfully. 16 As scientists become involved in commercial ventures, conflicts of interest may emerge. The Office of Science and Technology has produced guidance onmanaging these conflicts of interest (which is available on their websitewww.dti.gov.uk/ost). All the Research Establishments we have studied havedeveloped procedures to register, assess and monitor potential conflicts. Aftersuch scrutiny, some commercial activities may only be taken forward after thedevelopment of specific measures to manage risks relating to such conflicts.The arrangements rely on transparency and oversight from senior managementwho do not stand to benefit. The concerns voiced by scientists responding toour survey suggest that they attach importance to having access to an impartial procedure for challenging specific commercial activities. Effective commercialisation requires supporting capabilities 17 All Research Establishments have some scope for commercialisation and seek to ensure that commercial ideas are identified. The extent depends largely on thenature of an individual Research Establishment's science and the level of demandfrom the market sector in which it operates. Research Establishments sponsoredby the Medical Research Council operate in the human healthcare market sectorwith significant external demand in the United Kingdom and internationally. Incontrast, for example, the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences ResearchCouncil sponsored Silsoe Research Institute has traditionally operated in theagricultural engineering sector, where demand in the United Kingdom appearslow, following problems in that industry. Most Research Establishments do notcarry out assessments of prospective world-wide industry demand and do notgenerally have enough staff to follow a proactive industrial strategy.DELIVERING THE COMMERCIALISATION OF PUBLIC SECTOR SCIENCE7executive summaryDELIVERING THE COMMERCIALISATION OF PUBLIC SECTOR SCIENCE 18 There are examples of successful commercialisations from research developed following demand from industry (technology pull) and from ResearchEstablishments, themselves, deciding to take development forward (technologypush). But there are indications that technology push projects have acomparatively lower success rate, encounter difficulties in raising developmentfinance, and require more confidence in the science, resources, effort and timefrom commercialisation specialists and the scientists. The Office of Science andTechnology and the Treasury consider that technology push projects canusefully play a part in a portfolio, bearing these factors in mind. 19 The three Research Councils have chosen to apply different degrees of centralisation to their commercialisation activities, which they explain as dueto differences in mission and the scope of the opportunity. Our examination hasshown that different approaches can work, when allied to commitment.Developing a portfolio will help Research Establishments to diversify risk,explore options, and possibly increase the number of successful projects. Thereare two distinct portfolios that Research Establishments could aim to develop:where practical, a related body of intellectual property or know-how whichthey could manage actively; and if this is achieved, a portfolio ofcommercialisation projects based on different routes to market andincorporating different types of partnership with the private sector. 20 Research Establishments can maximise a portfolio of commercial activity either individually or, even though they are often in competition for grantfunding, by working together across organisational boundaries to establish a critical mass of opportunities (paragraph 3.10). To facilitate this, the Baker Report recommended that intellectual property should be delegated toResearch Establishments. The Babraham Institute, for example, building onpast success, manages actively its own relatively modest amount ofintellectual property (paragraph 4.16). In the case of the Medical ResearchCouncil intellectual property is managed centrally on behalf of its 40 component units, many of which are small, realising the advantage ofcritical mass in the Bio-medical sector; in contrast the Biotechnology andBiological Sciences Research Council is decentralised, partly because its eightinstitutes are all large and operate in distinct market sectors. As funding forresearch programmes often comes from more than one source, poolingintellectual property could involve a number of different parties that havedifferent intellectual property policies. Co-ordination of these policies isimportant to ensure that there is clarity about which policy applies and whowill lead for commercialisation purposes.8executive summaryDELIVERING THE COMMERCIALISATION OF PUBLIC SECTOR SCIENCE 21 Adequate finance is needed to resource commercialisation including patenting, funding additional scientific work to demonstrate commercial potential,remunerating professional commercial staff, and obtaining external advice. Oncea portfolio of commercial deals is in place, it may provide an income streamwhich can be recycled to produce a continuing flow of opportunities. TheMedical Research Council income has grown from \u00a3150,000 in 1986-87 to some\u00a37 million in 1999-2000 and \u00a317.9 million in 2000-01. Other bodies are at anearlier stage and may need external resources to help to kick-start the process. 22 Tackling this initial shortfall in resources is important if the commercial potential of Research Establishments' scientific output is to be realised. TheGovernment has recognised the need to provide additional finance through a\u00a310 million competition held in 2001, called the PSRE Fund competition. Upto half this fund was planned to build commercial capabilities in eligiblebodies, with the balance intended for pre-seed funding, that is funding todemonstrate to potential partners the link between an invention or a range ofintellectual property and the proposed new products or services. The potentialscale of commercial activity, and the limited extent of existing finance, isindicated by the fact that bids for the fund exceeded the \u00a310 million on offer,even though Partnerships UK told us that some likely bidders were discouragedby what they considered the modest amount proposed. On the basis of a 50:50 split, the PSRE Fund has been over-subscribed by 11:5 for capabilitybuilding and 13:5 for seed funding. The Office of Science and Technologyguidelines for seed funding suggests that investments are made over a three year period and requests that funds be managed in a way that ensure agood prospect of continued existence in the long term. Given the length of timetaken for commercialisation work to yield a return, venture capitalistscommented that this appears a difficult, and quite possibly unrealistic,objective. The Office of Science and Technology will, however, monitor thefinancial position of the seed fund, allocated \u00a34 million funding after the PSREFund competition, with a view to understanding the prospects for the emergingportfolio of investments. 23 The Government also encourages Research Establishments to explore other sources of finance such as those available from Regional DevelopmentAgencies and the University Challenge scheme, which \"enables universities toestablish seed funds to assist the transformation of good research into goodbusiness\", with the Government providing some \u00a340 million in two rounds bythe end of 2001 alongside an equivalent sum from charities and universitysources. Research Establishments can apply for University Challenge funding aspart of a university bid. Information on Research Establishments' success inobtaining funding from these sources, including successful UniversityChallenge bids, and how it is spent is not easily available. The Office of Scienceand Technology monitors funding committed to particular projects through theannual reporting process and makes summary information available at theaggregate level, but not at the detailed level. Realising the potential benefits of commercialisation 24 The Research Establishments we studied, as a group, have developed the full range of commercialisation opportunities, from free dissemination ofinformation to venture capital financed spin out companies. Thesedevelopments offer significant potential benefits to the economy and to society 9executive summaryDELIVERING THE COMMERCIALISATION OF PUBLIC SECTOR SCIENCE as well as to the Research Establishments themselves. Since the Treasury agreed in 1999 that Research Councils and Research Establishments could retain thefinancial benefits of their commercial activity and share this between them inwhatever proportion they agree, commercialisation receipts have been usednot only to sustain further commercialisation activity but also for extra scientificresearch. Our parallel report on research funded by the Department for theEnvironment, Food and Rural Affairs examines a notable example at theBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council sponsored Roslin Institute, where nuclear transfer technology, pioneered by cloning Dolly the sheep, generated such receipts. The Biotechnology and BiologicalSciences Research Council also anticipates that, if it is brought to marketsuccessfully, the Roslin Institute will earn substantial future royalties from acystic fibrosis treatment currently undergoing clinical trials. 25 As suggested in paragraph 13, these benefits are most likely to be realised if a Research Establishment has a strategy for its intellectual property and know-how which focuses on a clear set of desired outcomes. Thorough riskmanagement procedures, although not formally undertaken at present, are alsoimportant. A key determinant of the value obtained from commercialisationdeals is the worth of the intellectual property that the Research Establishment iscommitting. By providing a range of intellectual property, as in the case of theHuman Reproductive Science Unit (Figure 15) , Research Establishments can make a venture more attractive to the private sector. Assessing the worth ofintellectual property is difficult, and precise valuation is unrealistic. Asystematic categorisation, for example, into therapeutic area, market potential,competition, cost of manufacture (if knowable), complexity of developmentand time to market, can, however, inform the comparative assessment ofprojects in a portfolio. 26 In the sample of Research Establishments we examined, we have not investigated specific deals in detail, but the Research Establishments appear tobe reducing their potential exposure by taking little management or financialrisk and allowing these risks to be managed by the private sector. This is asensible way to start. We also found that Research Establishments are seekingto protect the public interest from non-financial risks, such as developingintellectual property in a way that impacts adversely on the achievement oftheir core pure science goals, through ad hoc arrangements. 27 We have examined \"The Radiocommunications Agency's joint venture with CMG\" (HC21 December 2000) in detail. This innovative joint venture wasentered into partly to help the Radiocommunications Agency exploit itstechnical expertise. Although the Radiocommunications Agency has a verydifferent role to that of a Research Establishment, there are some useful generallessons. We praised the Radiocommunications Agency for identifying the keyelements of a successful partnership and incorporating them in the joint venture,while at the same time negotiating a contractual framework that meant thatsatisfactory delivery was not solely dependent on a collaborative relationship.Partnerships UK published detailed guidance on setting up joint venturecompanies in December 2001. In constructing partnership deals, ResearchEstablishments will benefit from a considered choice of partner, where possible,and a cohesive negotiating strategy that keeps the scientists well-informed andfully motivated, alongside their commercial colleagues, to take forward thescientific aspect of commercial development.10executive summaryDELIVERING THE COMMERCIALISATION OF PUBLIC SECTOR SCIENCE Recommendations (A)For the Department, the Office of Science and Technology, andResearch Councils: Review performance indicators including recognition of the diversityof research and hence of theperformance indicators required.(paragraphs 2.8 and 2.9) (B)For the Research Councils: B.1 Research Councils should hold annual operational reviews,dealing with commercialisation,with all Research Establishments.(paragraph 2.13) B.2 Research Councils should establish guidelines, on anexception basis, for ResearchEstablishments to take advice on conflicts of interest and to consider forming anindependent science advisoryboard to advise them on novelcases.
