Dog's Name: Iris Faith Owner's Name: J I want to share my remarkable 14-year-old Border Terrier's story with you. Iris Faith became my service dog at 14 months of age, then earned her certification as a Search & Recovery K-9. She led a life of service before she became ill at Thanksgiving. She was admitted to Summit Hospital in Tacoma, Washington, in critical condition due to a gallbladder mucocele that went from immature to life-threatening in a month... When this website was born, I knew people needed a reliable source of information and top-quality natural health products and supplements they could trust. My journey began with helping dogs, but as time progressed I realized that our dogs' health depends on our health too. This is why our website and products are focused on helping both you and your canine companion on your health journey. Throughout my 30+ years in veterinary practice, I developed an integrative approach to healing that blends the knowledge of Western and natural veterinary medicine and nutrition. This approach has provided reliable, proven results, without any of the side effects of drugs. I'm happy to share this healing system with you here along with our five-star-rated products to support and heal, providing you and your dog with a longer health span and lifespan. Good health is achieved by supporting the body and embracing the solid principles of a healthy lifestyle and nutrition inspired by nature, leaving drugs only as a last resort. My team and I hope to provide you with the answers you're looking for to create vibrant health and happiness for you and your dog for many years to come.
