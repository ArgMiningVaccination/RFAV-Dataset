Information about the COVID -19 Vaccine The COVID -19 vaccines are not live virus vaccines so the vaccines cannot infect anyone with COVID -19. All needles and syringes are sterile, are one -time use and are safely discarded. According to data, the COVID -19 vaccine has approximately a 94% success rate in completely protecting those who receive it. The remainder have partial protection and will have greatly lessened symptoms if they do contract COVID -19. The vaccine will begin to provide protection about one to two weeks after the second shot of the series is given. At this tim e, we do not know how long the COVID -19 vaccine is effective for, so you may need future vaccines to remain protected. While the COVID -19 vaccination does provide protection against infection or greatly lessened symptoms if you contract COVID -19, you shoul d continue to practice hand hygiene and use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
