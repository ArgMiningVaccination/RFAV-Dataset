Approved for CE Credits to helping healthcare professionals advance and improve patient care through our carefully and expertly designed programs. Many patients prefer a more natural approach to their medical care. As a healthcare professional, you are looking to meet patients where they are in their journey. Understanding how essential oils can be used to manage symptoms and improve quality of life is vitally important. The ISFTA Enriching Alternative Medicine with Essential Oils Course is designed to provide an introduction on the science of essential oils. The uses of essential oils are vast and represent a well-documented model for improving overall health. Widespread acceptance of essential oils has led many to choose this more natural approach to health maintenance. This course focuses heavily on the case for complimentary and integrative medicine. Where modern medicine fails, alternative, or more appropriately said, integrative medicine excels. Complementary medicine relies on gifts provided by Mother Nature as remedies and employs these remedies to support the body's remarkable innate ability to heal. The perception that no evidence exists regarding the safety and efficacy of natural remedies is misguided and utterly false. The truth is there are tens of thousands of studies supporting numerous natural remedies as valuable solutions for just as many health conditions and diseases. One need only search PubMed, the U.S. National Library of Medicine's database to find this evidence. The future of essential oil therapy is the evidence-based model and therefore the model utilized for this course. The evidence based model combines ancient traditions, established protocols, consensus of user testimonials, and scientific evidence to determine therapeutic and safe uses and protocols for countless health conditions. This class is a MUST for ANYONE interested in learning more about a modality that is changing lives and making its way into mainstream medicine. Whether you are looking to increase your knowledge personally or professionally, this class will transform you. Earn CEs from the comfort and safety of home on any internet enabled device.
