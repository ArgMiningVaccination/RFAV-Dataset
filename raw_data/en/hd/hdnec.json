It is expected that COVID-19 vaccines will become available in China by the end of 2020. Vaccinating children against COVID-19 would contribute to the control of the pandemic and the recovery of the global economy. For children under the age of 18 years, parents are usually the decision makers regarding their children's vaccination. The goal of this study was to investigate parental acceptability of free COVID-19 vaccination for children under the age of 18 years in China. This is a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional, closed online survey among 2053 factory workers in Shenzhen, China, implemented from September 1 to 7, 2020. Participants of the online survey were full-time employees aged 18 years or over who had resumed work in factories in Shenzhen. Factory workers in Shenzhen are required to receive physical examinations once a year. Eligible workers attending six designated physical examination sites were invited to complete an online survey. This study was based on a subsample of those who had at least one child under the age of 18 years (N=1052). After being briefed that COVID-19 vaccines developed by China are likely to be available by the end of 2020, participants were asked about their likelihood of having their children under the age of 18 years take up free COVID-19 vaccination provided by the government, if it existed. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to examine the associations of perceptions related to COVID-19 vaccination based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and exposure to information related to COVID-19 through social media with parental acceptability, after controlling for significant background characteristics. The prevalence of parents' acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination for their children was 72.6% (764/1052). After adjusting for significant background characteristics, positive attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.70, 95% CI 1.50-1.91), the perception that a family member would support them in having their children take up COVID-19 vaccination (ie, perceived subjective norm) (AOR 4.18, 95% CI 3.21-5.43), and perceived behavioral control to have the children take up COVID-19 vaccination (AOR 1.84, 95% CI 1.49-2.26) were associated with higher parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination. Regarding social media influence, higher exposure to positive information related to COVID-19 vaccination was associated with higher parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination (AOR 1.35, 95% CI 1.17-1.56). Higher exposure to negative information related to COVID-19 vaccination was negatively associated with the dependent variable (AOR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74-0.99). Parents' acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination for their children under 18 years of age was high in China. The TPB is a useful framework to guide the development of future campaigns promoting COVID-19 vaccination targeting parents. Transparency in communicating about the vaccine development process and vaccine safety testing is important. Public health authorities should also address misinformation in a timely manner. Globally, the COVID-19 pandemic remains out of control [ The United States National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has proposed a five-phase plan to fairly allocate a COVID-19 vaccine. Health care workers, older adults, and other people with underlying conditions that put them at high risk of severe COVID-19 diseases or death are priority groups to receive the vaccine, followed by essential workers, children, and young adults [ Mathematic modeling suggested that if the COVID-19 vaccine efficacy was 80%, the coverage would have to achieve at least 75% to extinguish the ongoing pandemic [ Previous studies showed that people are actively seeking information about COVID-19 vaccination on social media platforms [ To our knowledge, there have been no studies investigating parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination for their children in China. This study investigated parental acceptability of free COVID-19 vaccination for children under the age of 18 years among parents in Shenzhen, China. We examined the effects of factors on their acceptability, including background characteristics, perceptions related to COVID-19 vaccination based on the TPB, and exposure to information related to COVID-19 vaccination through social media. This is a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional, closed online survey among 2053 factory workers in Shenzhen, China, implemented from September 1 to 7, 2020. Participants of the closed online survey were full-time employees of factories in Shenzhen aged 18 years of age or older. This study was conducted in Longhua District of Shenzhen. The majority of factories in Shenzhen are located in Longhua District; there were over 2000 factories and one million factory workers in 2018 in this district. In Shenzhen, factory workers are required to receive physical examinations at designated sites once a year. All six designated sites providing physical examination services to factory workers in Longhua District, including three public hospitals, two private hospitals, and the district Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), were chosen as our study sites for recruitment. To avoid selection bias, the fieldworkers approached all adults attending these sites for physical examinations during the study period. They briefed prospective participants about the study details, confirmed their eligibility, and invited them to join the study. Participants were guaranteed that participation was voluntary, refusal would have no effect on them, the survey would not collect personal contact information or identification, and data would be kept strictly confidential and would only be used for research purposes. Verbal consent was obtained instead of written consent to allow participants to maintain anonymity. We developed an online questionnaire using Questionnaire Star (Changsha Ranxing Information Technology Co), a commonly used online survey platform in China. Quick response (QR) codes were generated to access the online questionnaire. Prospective participants were asked to scan the QR code on-site to complete the survey. Each mobile device was allowed to access the online questionnaire once to avoid duplicate responses. The participants were asked not to disseminate the QR codes that were used to access the survey to other people. The survey had 66 items, approximately 15 items per page for four pages, which took about 15 minutes to complete. The online survey platform performed completeness checks before each questionnaire was submitted. Participants were able to review and change their responses through a Out of 2653 eligible factory workers being approached, which included between 60 and 1200 across the study sites, 2053 completed the online survey, which amounted to between 40 and 968 across the study sites. The overall response rate was 77.4% (2053/2653); this ranged from 66.7% to 80.7% at different sites. Main reasons for nonresponse were lack of time and other logistic reasons. This study was based on 1052 participants who had at least one child under the age of 18 years. Ethics approval was obtained from Longhua District CDC (reference No. 2020001). A panel consisting of one CDC staff member, two public health researchers, a health psychologist, a senior factory manager, and a factory worker was formed to develop the questionnaire used in this study. The questionnaire was pilot-tested among 10 factory workers to assess clarity and readability. These 10 workers did not participate in the actual survey. Based on participants' comments, the panel revised and finalized the questionnaire. Participants were asked to report on sociodemographics (ie, age, gender, relationship status, education level, monthly personal income, etc), age of their children, parental history of seasonal influenza vaccination, and whether they had a family member with a history of COVID-19. In addition, participants were asked to report on their frequency of wearing face masks when having close contacts with others in the workplace and in other public settings (ie, public spaces and transportation) in the past month; response categories included Participants were briefed with the following statement: \"COVID-19 vaccines developed by China are likely to become available by the end of 2020.\" They were then asked about the likelihood of having their children under the age of 18 years take up free COVID-19 vaccination provided by the government, if it existed; response categories included the following: 1 (very unlikely), 2 (unlikely), 3 (neutral), 4 (likely), and 5 (very likely). Parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination was defined as the responses Two scales were constructed to assess perceptions related to COVID-19 vaccination based on the TPB. These scales were the 3-item Positive Attitude Scale (eg, \"COVID-19 vaccination is highly effective in protecting your child from COVID-19\") and the 4-item Negative Attitude Scale (eg, \"Your child will have severe side effects after receiving COVID-19 vaccination\"); response categories were as follows: 1 (disagree), 2 (neutral), and 3 (agree). The Cronbach values of these two scales were .71 and .64, respectively; single factors were identified by exploratory factor analysis, explaining 64.0% and 56.6% of the total variance, respectively. Perceived subjective norm (ie, \"Your family member will support you in having your child take up COVID-19 vaccination\") and perceived behavioral control (ie, \"Having your child receive COVID-19 vaccination is easy for you if you want them to\") were measured by two single items; the response categories were as follows: 1 (disagree), 2 (neutral), and 3 (agree). Participants were asked to report on the frequency of their exposure to information related to COVID-19 vaccination on social media (ie, WeChat, WeChat Moments, Weibo, TikTok, etc) in the past month; response categories were as follows: 1 (almost none), 2 (seldom), 3 (sometimes), and 4 (always). Such information included (1) positive information related to COVID-19 vaccination (eg, new vaccines entering clinical trials), (2) negative information related to COVID-19 vaccination (eg, concerns about vaccine efficacy, supply, and side effects and about the receipt of vaccines causing COVID-19), (3) testimonials given by participants of the COVID-19 clinical trials, and (4) negative information about vaccine incidents in China (eg, selling problematic vaccines and severe side effects). Parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination was used as the dependent variable. A univariate logistic regression model first assessed the significance of the association between each of the background characteristics and the dependent variable. Background characteristics with Over half of the participants were 40 years old or younger (824/1052, 78.3%), were female (658/1052, 62.5%), were married (1005/1052, 95.5%), did not receive tertiary education (785/1052, 74.6%), had a monthly income level lower than \u00a55000 (US $714) (703/1052, 66.8%), and were frontline workers (701/1052, 66.6%). Among the parents, 20.0% (210/1052) had received seasonal influenza vaccination in the past and 0.2% (2/1052) had at least one family member with a history of COVID-19. About half of their children were 0 to 6 years of age (490/1052, 46.6%). In the past month, 72.1% (759/1052) and 83.1% (874/1052) of participants reported wearing a face mask every time they had close contact with other people in the workplace and in other public settings, respectively. Fewer participants self-reported sanitizing their hands (606/1052, 57.6%), avoiding social and meal gatherings (622/1052, 59.1%), and avoiding crowed places (697/1052, 66.3%) (see Background characteristics of the parents. |Characteristics||Value (N=1052), n (%)| | ||Yes||697 (66.3)| Among the parents, the prevalence of parental acceptability of free COVID-19 vaccination was 72.6% (764/1052) (see Perceptions related to COVID-19 vaccination. |Acceptability and (N=1052), | (1.2)| | || ||COVID-19 vaccination is highly effective in protecting your child from COVID-19 (agree), n (%)||603 (57.3)| | || ||Taking up COVID-19 vaccination can contribute to the control of COVID-19 in China (agree), n (%)||896 (85.2)| | || ||China will have an adequate supply of COVID-19 vaccine (agree), n (%)||763 (72.5)| | || || (1.6)| | || ||Your child will have severe side effects after receiving COVID-19 vaccination (agree), n (%)||104 (9.9)| | || ||The protection of COVID-19 vaccines will only last for a short time (agree), n (%)||210 (20.0)| | || ||Your child is afraid of vaccination (agree), n (%)||216 (20.5)| | || ||You do not have time to take your child for COVID-19 vaccination (agree), n (%)||234 (22.2)| | || || the 3-item Positive Attitude Scale were as follows: 1 (disagree), 2 (neutral), and 3 (agree).

In the univariate logistic regression analysis, age of the children, self-reported avoiding of social and meal gatherings with other people who do not live together, and self-reported avoiding of crowed places were significantly associated with parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination (see Associations between background characteristics and parental acceptability of free COVID-19 vaccination (N=1052). |Characteristics||Crude odds ratio | school or (1.27-2.22)||<.001| aN/A: not applicable. After adjusting for these significant background characteristics, positive attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.70, 95% CI 1.50-1.91), perceiving that a family member would support them in having their children take up COVID-19 vaccination (AOR 4.18, 95% CI 3.21-5.43), and perceived behavioral control to have the children receive COVID-19 vaccination (AOR 1.84, 95% CI 1.49-2.26) were associated with higher parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination.

About 70% of the Chinese parents accepted COVID-19 vaccination for their children. However, given the gap between acceptability and actual behaviors [ Our findings provided empirical insights to inform health promotion development. More attention should be given to parents with younger children and those with lower compliance to physical distancing measures (ie, avoiding social and meal gatherings and crowed places), as they reported lower parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination. Parents with children attending primary or secondary schools (ie, 7-17 years of age) might have more concerns about COVID-19 transmission within schools and, hence, have higher motivation to vaccinate their children against COVID-19. Parents with higher compliance to physical distancing measures may have stronger motivation and self-efficacy to protect themselves and their children, and COVID-19 vaccination is likely to be considered a useful means for protection. The TPB is a potentially useful framework to guide the development of future programs, as three of four TPB constructs used in this study were significantly associated with parental acceptability in expected directions. It is useful to increase positive attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination, as this was a facilitator. In addition to the beneficial effect for their children (eg, prevent COVID-19 effectively), health communication messages should also emphasize to parents that having their children take up COVID-19 vaccination would result in herd immunization, which could contribute to COVID-19 control. Building up confidence related to vaccine supply may also be a useful strategy. Over half of participants perceived that their family members would support them in having their children take up COVID-19 vaccination. Such perception was also a facilitator. Future health promotion should enhance parents' knowledge of COVID-19 vaccination and encourage them to discuss their children's vaccination with other family members in order to obtain support from these significant others. It is also useful to enhance perceived behavioral control, as this was another facilitator. There is much room for improvement. Multiple strategies may be applied in future COVID-19 vaccination programs, which may include simplification of the procedures to obtain vaccination and school-based vaccination programs. Relatively few participants had concerns related to side effects, duration of vaccine protection, children's apprehension, or other logistical issues. The associations between these concerns and parental acceptability were not statistically significant. Addressing these concerns might not be useful strategies in future promotion campaigns. Our findings suggested that COVID-19 vaccination triggered intensive responses on social media among Chinese parents, as about 70% of the participants were sometimes or always exposed to information specific to COVID-19 vaccination on different social media platforms. Exposure to content about positive information related to COVID-19 vaccination, such as promising vaccine efficacy, was associated with higher parental acceptability. This is understandable, as this type of information can increase parents' confidence in COVID-19 vaccines and reduce their concerns. Higher exposure to negative information about COVID-19 vaccination was associated with lower parental acceptability. Previous studies showed that people were more likely to absorb negative rather than positive information during a disease outbreak [ This is one of the first studies investigating parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination in China. It used the TPB as a theoretical framework and the sample size was relatively large. However, it has a number of limitations. First, we only included parents who were factory workers, as this was a secondary analysis. In 2018, 34.3% of Shenzhen's population were factory workers [ In sum, parents' acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination for their children under the age of 18 years was high among Chinese parents. The TPB is a useful framework to guide the development of future campaigns promoting COVID-19 vaccination targeting parents. Enhancing positive attitudes, creating a supportive subjective norm, and increasing parents' perceived behavioral control related to their children's COVID-19 vaccination are potentially useful health promotion strategies. Transparency in communicating about the vaccine development process and vaccine safety testing is important. Public health authorities should also address misinformation in a timely manner. adjusted odds ratio Centre for Disease Control and Prevention quick response theory of planned behavior None declared.
