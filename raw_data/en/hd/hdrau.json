It is one of the most popular recreation al drugs - only tobacco, alcohol and caffeine are more popular. Medical cannabis (or medical marijuana) refers to t he use of cannabis or cannabinoids as medical therapy to treat disease or alleviate sympt oms. Common conditions for which cannabis based medicine (CBM) may be indicated incl ude chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, as an appetite stimulant for AIDS and cancer patients, chronic pain, and spasticity in multiple sclerosis. OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT To conduct a systematic review, supported by GRADE summaries, of the evidence for the effects (first objective) and adverse events (secon d objective) of medical cannabis. METHODS This review followed the guidance published by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and the Cochrane Collaboration. Twenty-eight databases (CDSR, DARE, HTA, NHS EED, I NAHTA, NIHR Project Portfolio, GIN, NGC, NICE PROSPER O, EuroScan, Embase, Citation Index, CINAHL, SCI, AMED, CENTRAL, IACM, IACM Database of Clinical Studies and Case Reports, NIH ClinicalTrials.gov, metaRegister of Controlled Trials, WHO ICTRP) were searched for randomised controlled trials, relevant observationa l studies and previously published systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The searches were carried out in April 2014 and were not limited by language. Randomised trials were included if they assessed an y form of medical cannabis in people with nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy; HIV/A IDS (as appetizer); chronic pain; spasticity due to multiple sclerosis or movement disorders due to Tourette's syndrome compa red to usual care, placebo or no treatment. For most populations inclusion was not restricted based on outcome. Only studies in patients with HIV/AIDS that report data on outcomes related to appetite were eligible; for patients with depression only studies that report data on outcomes related to depression were eligible; and for patients with gla ucoma, only studies that report data on intraocular pressure were eligible. Cross-over tri als were only included if they fulfilled the following criteria that we considered to define a c ross-over trial: included random treatment orders and were balanced in design i.e. participant s received the same number of treatments. For populations for which no RCTs were available lower levels of evidence were considered based on the following hierarchy: 1) obs ervational studies with concurrent Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 14 control groups; 2) observational studies with non-c oncurrent control groups; 3) uncontrolled studies (such as case series) with at least 25 pati ents. Titles and abstracts identified through electronic database and web searching were independently screened by two reviewers. In order to minimise bias and errors, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were perform ed independently by two reviewers. Results of direct comparisons of relevant treatment s were presented and supplemented by narrative discussions of the study characteristics. Results of quantitative analysis and meta- analysis were also presented following the guidance by the GRADE Working Group. RESULTS For the first objective (clinical effects), primary searches identified 15,786 hits of which 423 were considered potentially relevant and obtained a s full text studies. Depression was the only indication of interest for which no relevant R CTs were identified. Additional focused searches were conducted to identify eligible non-ra ndomised studies for this indication. These searches did not find any potentially relevan t studies even when going to the lowest level of evidence specified as eligible for the rev iew (uncontrolled studies with at least 25 patients). A total of 76 studies available as 1 47 reports were included in the review of effectiveness. The majority of the 76 included studies (6380 parti cipants) evaluated nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy (28 studies), chronic pain (27 studies) and spasticity due to MS and paraplegia (12 studies). All other patient categor ies were evaluated in less than five studies. Thirty-two studies were parallel group studies (439 7 participants) and 44 were cross-over trials (1983). The parallel group trials generally enrolled greater number of participants than the cross-over trials (median 70, range 13 to 657 i n the parallel group trials; median 48, range 6 to 214 in the cross-over trials). Many of the included studies were very old. Date of publication ranged from 1975 to 2014 (median 2004) with 1/3 of trials published before 1990. Studies were conducted in wide range of coun tries. Twenty seven studies were funded by the drug manufacturer, fifteen were mixed funded between industry and public bodies, nineteen were funded by public bodies and f ifteen did not provide information on source of funding. Only four (5%) trials were judge d at low risk of bias overall, 52 (68%) were judged at high risk of bias, and 20 (26%) at unclea r risk of bias. Cannabis was evaluated in a variety of different fo rms. These included oral formulations of cannabidiol nabiximols (a combinatio n of THC/CBD). Of the 76 included studies, 53 included a placebo control. A variety of active comparators were included in the trials, with some including both active comparator and placebo. These Systematic Reviews Ltd 15 For the second objective (adverse events), searches identified 5085 hits of which 70 were considered potentially relevant and obtained as ful l text studies. Thirty-one studies available as 46 reports were included. These studie s on long-term adverse events amend the data on short-term AEs reported in the studies included for objective 1 (clinical effects). Nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy Twenty-eight studies (37 publications; 1772 partici pants) evaluated CBM for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in adults and children under going chemotherapy. The studies included patients with a variety of cancers. Some were restricted to single cancer types such as testicular cancer or lung cancer, others in cluded patients with a specific type of cancer such as gastrointestinal or advanced gynaeco logical cancers, but most included mixed cancers. Seven studies used a parallel group design (467 participants) and twenty one (1305) were cross-over trials. None of the stu dies were rated as low risk of bias overall, 23 were judged at high risk of bias and five at unc lear risk of bias. Therefore the results should be interpreted with some caution. Overall there was some evidence that CBM reduces na usea and vomiting and improves appetite and functional status in patients receivin g chemotherapy treatment for various types of cancer. All studies reported beneficial e ffects on all outcomes assessed but these did not reach statistical significance in all studi es and some did report on the statistical significance of their findings. There were only su fficient data to pool results for one outcome, the number of patients showing a complete nausea and vomiting response. This showed a significant beneficial effect of CBM compa red to placebo (OR 3.44, 95% CI 1.45, 8.15). HIV/AIDS Four studies (255 participants) evaluated CBM as a treatment for appetite stimulation in patients with HIV/AIDS. Three RCTs used a parallel group design (243 participants) and one (12 participants) was a cross-over trial. All stud ies were judged at high risk of bias. There was some evidence that dronabinol is associat ed with an increase in weight compared to placebo. More limited evidence suggested that i t may also be associated with increased appetite, greater % body fat, reduced nausea, and i mproved functional status. However, these outcomes were mostly assessed in single studi es and failed to reach statistical significance. One trial evaluated marijuana and dr onabinol, this study found significantly greater weight gain with both forms of cannabis com pared to placebo. An active comparison study found that megestrol acetate was a ssociated with greater weight gain than dronabinol and that combining dronabinol with megestrol acetate did not lead to additional weight gain. Chronic pain Twenty-seven studies (61 publications, 2439 partici pants) evaluated CBM as a treatment for chronic pain. The conditions causing the chronic p ain varied between studies and included neuropathic pain (central, peripheral or not specif ied; 11 studies), cancer pain (three Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 16 studies), diabetic peripheral neuropathy (3 studies ), fibromyalgia (2 studies), HIV associated sensory neuropathy (2 studies), refractory pain due to MS or other neurological conditions (1 study), rheumatoid arthritis (1 study), non-canc er pain (1 study), central pain (not specified further; 1 study), musculoskeletal proble ms (1 study) and chemotherapy induced pain (1 study). Fourteen studies were parallel gro up studies (1980 participants) and fourteen used a cross-over design (459 participants ). The risk of bias in the included studies was variable. Only two were rated as low risk of b ias for all domains while a further nine were rated as unclear risk of bias. Overall there was some evidence that CBM may reduce pain, there was less evidence for an effect on other outcomes such as quality of life an d global impression of change. Studies generally suggested a beneficial effect of CBM on m easures of pain but this did not reach statistical significance in most individual studies . Summary estimates for outcomes where there were sufficient data to permit pooling sugges ted a beneficial effect of cannabis on all measures both dichotomous and continuous, e.g. 30% reduction in pain (OR 1.35, 95%-CI 0.95 to 1.93). Dichotomous data suggested a signif icant beneficial effect of CBM on patient global impression of change. There was some eviden ce to support this based on continuous data but this was not consistent across trials. Se nsitivity analyses that included cross-over trials in the meta-analyses showed results consiste nt with those based on parallel group trials alone. Spasticity due to multiple sclerosis (MS) or parapl egia Twelve studies (31 reports; 2213 participants) eval uated CBM as a treatment for spasticity due to MS or paraplegia. Ten studies (2188 partici pants) included patients with MS and two included patients with paraplegia (25 participants) caused by spinal cord injury. Eight RCTs used a parallel group design (2091 participants) an d four (122 participants) were cross-over trials. The risk of bias in the included studies w as variable. Only two, by the same author, were rated as low risk of bias for all domains. A further five were rated as unclear risk of bias. Overall there was some evidence that CBM may improv e spasticity and patient global impression of change, there was less evidence for a n effect on other outcomes such as quality of life, mobility/disability and general di sease specific symptoms. Studies generally suggested a beneficial effect of CBM on measures of spasticity but this failed to reach statistical significance in most studies. The summ ary estimate for the Ashworth scale based on parallel group trials suggested a significant be neficial effect of CBM on spasticity (5 studies: WMD -0.14, 95%-CI -0.27 to -0.01). Other measures of spasticity also suggested a beneficial effect but did not reach statistical sig nificance. Dichotomous data suggested a significant beneficial effect of CBM on patient glo bal impression of change; this was supported by a further cross-over trial that provid ed continuous data for this outcome. There were no clear differences between the differe nt types of CBM evaluated in these studies. Sensitivity analyses that included cross- over trials in the meta-analyses showed results consistent with those based on parallel gro up trials alone. Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 17 Depression No studies evaluating cannabis for the treatment of depression fulfilled inclusion criteria for the review. Additional searches were carried out f or this population with lower levels of evidence eligible for inclusion. These searches di d not locate any eligible studies. Five studies included for other sections of this re view reported on depression as an outcome measure. Four of these studies evaluated patients with chronic pain and one was conducted in patients with MS. Three studies were parallel group trials and two were cross- over trials. Two studies were rated as unclear ris k of bias while the remaining three were rated as high risk of bias. There was no data available on the CBM for the trea tment of depression. Studies included for other sections of the review that reported on d epression as an outcome found little evidence of an effect of CBM on depression. Anxiety One parallel group trial evaluated patients with an xiety disorder. This study was conducted in 24 patients with generalised social anxiety diso rder in Brazil. Participants were randomised to receive either cannabidiol or placebo before taking part in a simulated public speaking test. The study was judged at high risk o f bias. The study reported a significant beneficial effect of cannabidiol compared to placebo on change from before to during a simulated public spe aking test on the anxiety factor of a visual analogue mood scale (MD change from baseline -16.52, p-value 0.012). Additional data on anxiety outcomes provided by three studies (two cross-over and one parallel group) in patients with chronic pain also suggested a bene ficial effect of CBM but these studies were not restricted to patients with anxiety disord ers. Sleep disorder Two studies evaluated patients with sleep disorders . One study enrolled patients with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome and one included patients with fibromyalgia. One study was judged at low risk of bias the other at high ri sk of bias. One study reported a significant beneficial effect of nabilone on the sleep apnoea/hypopnea index (MD change from baseline -19.64, p-value 0.01 8) but this should be interpreted with some caution due to the methodological limitations associated with this study. The other study in patients with sleep disorders was a cross- over trial in patients with fibromyalgia and compared nabilone with amitriptyline. This suggest ed some beneficial effects of nabilone on insomnia (MD change from baseline -3.25, 95%-CI -5.26 to -1.24) but greater sleep restfulness (MD change from baseline 0.48, 95%-CI 0 .01 to 0.95) with amitriptyline. Nineteen studies included for other populations (ch ronic pain and MS) also evaluated sleep as an outcome. Overall there was some evidence tha t CBM may improve sleep in these patient groups. There were sufficient data to pool results for sleep quality (WMD -0.58, 95% CI -0.87 to -0.29) and , 95% CI -0.52 to 0.00), both suggested significant beneficial effects in favour of cannabi s. Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 18 Psychosis Two studies (9 reports, 71 participants) evaluated CBM as a treatment for psychosis. Both studies were conducted in Germany by the same group . One was a parallel group study (42 participants) and the other used a cross-over desig n (29 participants). Information on the cross-over trial was available only as conference a bstracts. The two studies enrolled patients with DSM-IV criteria of acute paranoid sch izophrenia or schizophreniform psychosis and 36 in the BPRS total score. Both trials evalu ated cannabidol (max dose 600- 800mg/day); the parallel group study compared this to the active comparator Amisulpride and the cross-over trial included a placebo control phase. The two studies were both rated as high risk of bias. The trials found no difference in outcomes between treatment groups (Mental health rated by Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and mood using PA NSS). Glaucoma One cross-over trial (6 participants) evaluated CBM for the treatment of glaucoma. It included patients with ocular hypertension or early open angle glaucoma, with a mild visual defect in at least one eye. The study compared THC (5mg), cannabidiol (20mg), cannabidiol (40mg) and placebo all in the form of an oromucosal spray and was judged at unclear risk of bias. This study found no evidence of an effect of CBM on intraocular pressure (MD at follow-up, Movement disorders due to Tourette syndrome Two small studies, one parallel group and one cross -over trial, suggested that THC capsules may be associated with a significant improvement in tic severity, e.g. MD change from baseline, TSSL-global score -9.08, 95%-CI -12.87 to -5.29. Adverse events Sixty-two of the 76 studies included in the clinica l effectiveness review provided data on short term adverse events. We found no evidence fo r a difference in the effect of cannabis on adverse events based on study design, population , comparator, method of cannabis administration or duration of follow-up, and so ana lyses were conducted for all studies combined. CBM was associated with a significantly greater risk of any AE, serious AE, withdrawals due to AE, ear and labyrinth disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, general disorders and administration site conditions, metab olism and nutrition disorders, psychiatric disorders, renal and urinary disorders, asthenia, b alance problems, confusion, diarrhoea, disorientation, drowsiness, dry mouth, euphoria, fa tigue, hallucination, nausea, somnolence, and vomiting. Other AEs did not show s ignificant differences between groups. We included an additional 31 observational studies (46 reports) to investigate the effects of cannabis on long term adverse events (cardiovascula r disease, respiratory disease, cancer, psychotic disorders, and suicide or suicidal ideati on). All studies examined the relationship Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 19 between recreational use of cannabis and the outcom es of interest; we did not find any studies that specifically assessed medical cannabis use and long term AEs. All studies had methodological weaknesses with none rated as low ri sk of bias and only four as moderate risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS Based on an extensive and rigorous systematic revie w of the literature of clinical effects and side effects of medical cannabis in ten populations which identified a total of 193 references to 76 RCTs and 31 observational studies, use of med ical cannabis might be warranted for some medical conditions. Medical cannabis showed statistically significant b eneficial effects for the treatment of nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy, chronic pa in, on spasticity due multiple sclerosis (MS) or paraplegia, anxiety, sleep disorders, and m ovement disorders due to Tourette syndrome. However, these results should be taken w ith some caution due to a very heterogeneous set of included studies which also su ffered from some potential risk of bias. However, short-term side effects are relatively com mon and include serious adverse events. Furthermore, long-term cannabis use is linked to ps ychosis. However, no other association with long-term adverse events was found. Again, the se findings might be restricted by methodological limitations of the identified studie s on short- and long-term adverse events. Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 20 1. BACKGROUND \"Very few drugs, if any, have such a tangled histor y as a medicine. In fact, prejudice, superstition, emotionalism, and even ideology have managed to lead cannabis to ups and downs concerning both its therapeutic properties an d its toxicological and dependence- inducing effects.\" E. A. Carlini 6 Cannabis is a generic term used for drugs produced from plants belonging to the genus Cannabis. Cannabis Sativa is the only species of t he genus Cannabis but is divided into two subspecies: Cannabis Sativa and Cannabis Indica. 7 Drugs derived from these plants are produced in three broad categories: marijuana (drie d leaves and flowering top of the plants), hashish (cannabis resin) and cannabis oil.8 Cannabis is not a single drug - it consists of over 400 chemicals, over 60 of which are cannabi noids. Cannabinoid is a collective name for any compound, natural or synthetic, that can mi mic the actions of plant-derived cannabinoids or that have structures that closely r esemble those of plant cannabinoids. 9 They include three broad classes: endocannabinoids (produced naturally in the body by humans and animals), phytocannabinoids (found in ca nnabis and some other plants), and synthetic cannabinoids (manufactured chemically ). The principal cannabinoid component of cannabis is 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (9-THC). 9, 10 It was first isolated and synthesised in the 1960s. 6 The 9-THC content of cannabis products varies according to the specific plant and conditions in which it is grown and on the cannabis product. It typically varies from around 5% in marijuana to 80% in hashis h oil. 11 A large number of other biologically active cannabinoids have (THCA). 6, 12 Cannabinoids act mainly via two different receptors : the prevalent CB-1 receptor and the CB-2 receptor. CB-1 is predominantly expressed on neurons, whilst CB-2 is predominantly expressed on cells of the immune system. The expre ssion of these receptors is the biological basis for the medical use of cannabinoid s in analgesia, as an anti-emetic and as an anti-inflammatory. Cannabinoids can interact with other biological pathways leading to complex physiological and pharmacological functions . Smoking and oral ingestion are the common administration routes. Smoking results in ra pid absorption and onset of psychoactive effects. Ingestion leads to delayed o nset and longer duration of actions. 13, 14 Cannabis is one of the most popular recreational dr ugs - only tobacco, alcohol and caffeine are more popular. It can result in an alteration t o mood and a feeling of \"high\". An estimated 141 million people use cannabis worldwide - this is equivalent to 2.5% of the world's population. 15 A review of studies that have evaluated self-repo rted cannabis effects found that frequently reported effects included rel axation, happiness/anti-depressant (some reported depression), cognitive benefits, res piratory benefits, creativity, socialising, sensory perception, improved sleep (some reported w orse sleep), deeper thinking, laughter, exaggeration of mood, slowing of time(some reported that it goes faster), increased Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 21 appetite, increased or decreased concentration, inc reased or decreased talkativeness, sexual pleasure, sexual arousal, floating sensation , sociability, drowsy, creativity, memory, paranoia, anxiety, depression, dizziness, hallucina tions/visions, and irritability. 16 Cannabis has also been associated with a number of short and long term adverse effects. Short term effects of cannabis include a dry mouth, blurred vi sion, dizziness, dysphoria, depression, ataxia, increased heart rate, paranoia, hallucinati ons, inability to discriminate or produce time and distance intervals, decreased vigilance, d ecreased ability to inhibit responses, and decreased ability to perform arithmetic tasks. 6, 8 Potential long term effects include developing cardiovascular or respiratory diseases o r cancers, dependence and precipitating psychotic disorders including Schizophrenia. 8, 17, 18 Cannabis was included as a controlled drug in the U nited Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs in 1961 19 , and the use of cannabis is illegal in most countr ies. However, in many countries it has been decriminalised or posses sion of small quantities is often unenforced. The only country in Europe in which po ssession is legal is the Netherlands. Figure 1 shows an overview of the legal status of c annabis throughout the world. FIGURE 1: LEGAL STATUS OF CANNABIS IN COUNTRIES ACROSS THE WOR LD Source: Wikipedia 20 In Switzerland, the production, culture, use and po ssession of cannabis is illegal and punishable by three years in prison or a fine. 21 Since September 2012 possession of less than 10 grams of cannabis is no longer considered a criminal offence but is still punishable by a 100 Swiss francs fine. 22 On 1 January 2012, several cantons introduced a n ew regulation which allowed private citizens to grow u p to four hemp plants. However, this was invalidated by the Federal Court in October 201 2. 23 The prevalence for cannabis consumption in Switzerland was estimated at 31% in 1998. 24 Medical cannabis (or medical marijuana) refers to t he use of cannabis or cannabinoids as medical therapy to treat disease or alleviate sympt oms. There is evidence of the use of cannabis for medical purposes going back to Early E gyptian times in the 16 th century BC, in China up to 4000 BC, India around 1000 years BC and in Europe around 450 BC. 25 The pen- Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 22 ts'ao ching the world's oldest herbal book (a collection of de scriptions of plants put together for medicinal purposes), includes reference to cann abis as medicine for rheumatic pain, intestinal constipation, disorders of the female re productive system, and malaria amongst others, this herbal book also contains the first re ference to cannabis as a psychoactive drug. 25 In India the plant was used for a variety of func tions including analgesia, anticonvulsant, hypnotic, or anphrodisiac, a ntitussive and expectorant. There are also references to it being used by women during labour to strengthen contractions and relieve pain. 26 Cannabis also has historical religious associatio ns in countries such as India and Tibet. There are some reports of European physicia ns using cannabis from the early 19 th century but the main introduction to Western medici ne was through the works of William O'Shaughnessy, an Irish physician, who wrote a pape r entitled \"On the preparations of the Indian hemp or gunjah\" which describes successful experiments using canna bis to treat rheumatism, convulsions, and muscular spasms of tet anus and rabies. 27 Cannabinoid based medicine (CBM) can be administere d orally, sublingually, smoked, inhaled, mixed with food, under the tongue as a tin cture, made into tea, or administered topically. It can be taken in herbal form, extract ed naturally from the plant, gained by isomerisation of cannabidol, or manufactured synthe tically. 12 Prescribed dronabinol gelatine capsules (brand name Marinol\u00ae s ince 1986, Abbott Products Inc.), nabilone capsules (brand name Cesamet\u00ae since 1981, Valeant Pharmaceutical International), and the sublingually administered o romucosal spray nabiximols (brand name Sativex\u00ae since 2005, GW Pharmaceuticals, UK , and p artners). 12 The patent has expired on Marinol\u00ae and Cesamet\u00ae and generic versions are now available (Watson Pharmaceuticals and Pharmascience Inc respectively). Generic THC i s also available, in Germany this is supplied by two companies (THC Pharm GmbH and Biono rica Ethics), allowing pharmacies to produce capsules and solutions which can be taken o rally or inhaled using a vaporiser. Some countries have legalised medicinal-grade canna bis to chronically ill patients. Canada and the Netherlands have government run programmes where specialised companies supply quality controlled herbal cannabis. 28 These programmes have been running since 2001 and 2003 respectively. In the US around a thi rd of states have introduced laws to permit the medical use of cannabis; other countries have similar laws. The Dutch programme offers pharmaceutical grade cannabis in t he form of dried female flowers (Cannabis Flos) which patients are advised to admin ister by preparing as a tea or using a cannabis vaporiser. Prescriptions are available to patients with multiple sclerosis, cancer, HIV/AIDS, chronic pain, therapy-resistant glaucoma, and Tourette's syndrome, with costs now increasingly reimbursed by health insurance com panies. 28 Israel and the Czech Republic are setting up similar programmes and Ital y, Finland and Germany are importing products from the Dutch programme. In a recent dec ision, a court in Cologne allowed chronically ill patients to grow cannabis if all ot her treatment options have been used. However, this decision only affects three patients and the wider impact remains to be seen. 29 A large international survey of 953 participants i n 31 countries found that smoking Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 23 marijuana was the most common mode of administratio n of CBM (tried by 95% of participants). A large proportion of respondents ( 87%) had also used herbal cannabis in foods, baked goods, or tinctures, but much smaller numbers had used the licenced medications 5% had experience of topical use of CBM. The preferred method of int ake was a herbal CBM in 97% of cases. 12 Common conditions for which CBM may be indicated in clude chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, as an appetite stimulant for AIDS and cancer patients, chronic pain, and spasticity in multiple sclerosis. The survey of 95 3 CBM users found that the most common primary conditions for which CBMs were used were ba ck pain (12%), sleeping disorder (7%), depression (7%), pain resulting from injury o r accident (6%), and multiple sclerosis (4%). 12 Similar results were found in an analysis of 1,65 5 applicants presenting to a marijuana specialty practice in California which fo und that the most common conditions were back pain (26%), sleep disorders (21%), anxiet (9%). 30 Other conditions for which CBMs were used in eithe r survey included ADHD/hyperactivity, allergy, anxiety, asth ma, autism, bipolar disorder, cancer, alcohol/opiate dependency, dysmenorrhea, endometrio sis, epilepsy, fibromyalgia, gastrointestinal disorders, irritable bowel disease, migraine/headache, neuropathy, post-traumatic stres s disorder, seizures, and spinal cord injury. The main symptoms for which relief was sou ght in the international survey included chronic pain (29%), anxiety (18%), loss of appetite and/or weight (11%), depression (5%), and insomnia or sleeping disorder (5%). The Califo rnian study reported on any symptom for which relief was sought. This study found that commonly reported reasons for taking CBM were pain (83%), to improve sleep (71%), for re laxation (56%), spasms headache (41%), anxiety (38%), and to increase appe tite. Other symptoms included breathing problems, chronic inflammation, cramps, d iarrhoea, lack of energy, general malaise, hyperactivity, inner unrest, irritability, itching, nausea or vomiting, panic, spasms, and spasticity. 12, 30 A smaller survey of 128 patients in German speaki ng countries (Germany, Austria and Switzerland) found that the m ost common indications for medicinal cannabis use were depression (12%), multiple sclero sis C (5%) and s leep disorders (5%). Most patients used natural cannabis products, only five patients used a prescription based formulation (Marionol\u00ae). 31 A large number of systematic reviews have examined the effectiveness of CBMs for the treatment of a variety of conditions including chro nic pain (non-cancer, cancer pain, neuropathic pain, multiple sclerosis related, mixed ), 32-40 symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis (spasticity and bladder dysfunction), 41-43 nausea and vomiting (palliative care patients, cancer patients, chemotherapy patients, a nd mixed), 44-47 Tourette's syndrome, 48 epilepsy, 49 dementia, 50 HIV/AIDS patients 51 post-traumatic stress disorder, 52 and one general review of medicinal use of marijuana. 53 There are also systematic reviews focussing specifically on the adverse effects of cannabis use - one on adverse effects in general 54 and Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 24 one on schizophrenia. 55 None of these reviews are up to date - the most r ecent search date was September 2013 in a review of cannabinoids for epilepsy. 49 Latest search dates for the other reviews ranged from 1999-2012. All except on e of the reviews focused on a narrow clinical area. There is therefore a need for an up to date systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness and adverse events of CBMs in a range of conditions. Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 25 2. OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT To conduct a systematic review, supported by GRADE summaries, of the evidence for the effects and adverse events of medical cannabis. Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 26 3. RESEARCH QUESTIONS 1. What are the clinical effects of medical canna bis in people with: nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy; HIV/AIDS (as appetize r); chronic pain; spasticity due (as antidepressant); anxiety disorder; sleep disorder; psychosis; glaucoma (reducing the pressure); or movement disorders due to Tourette's syndrome? 2. What are the adverse events associated with me dical cannabis? Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 27 4. METHODS 4.1 L ITERATURE SEARCHES Literature searches were undertaken to identify rel evant studies on the use of cannabis and cannabinoid derivatives as medical treatment for a number of indications. Search methods followed best practice standards in systematic revi ews.56, 57 The search strategies combined relevant search terms comprising indexed keywords ( e.g. Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and EMTREE terms) and free text terms appearing in the titles and/or abstracts of database records. Search terms were identified through disc ussion between the review team, by scanning background literature and 'key articles' a lready known to the review team, and by browsing database thesauri. The searches were not l imited by language, date or publication status (unpublished or published), and were conduct ed in three phases to identify existing systematic reviews, protocols, health technology as sessments (HTAs) and economic evaluations; clinical effectiveness of medicinal ca nnabis use; and adverse events resulting from medicinal cannabis use. 4.1.1 Rapid appraisal of systematic reviews, proto cols and health technology assessments A full rapid appraisal was conducted to retrieve ex isting systematic reviews, protocols, HTAs, economic evaluations, guidance and guidelines relating to the use of cannabis and cannabinoid derivatives in a therapeutic context. The following databases were searched from inceptio n to the March/April 2014: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) (W iley Online Library): issue 3/July 2014 Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE ) (Wiley Online Library): issue 1/January 2014 Health Technology Assessment database (HTA) (Wile y Online Library): issue 1/January 2014 NHS Economic Evaluations Database (NHS EED) (Wile y Online Library): issue 1/January 2014 International Network of Agencies for Health Tech nology Assessment (INAHTA) (Internet) ( http://www.inahta.org/ ): up to 2014/03/25 Project Portfolio (Internet) ( http://www.nets.nihr.ac.uk/projects/ ): up to 2014/03/25 International Guidelines Network Library (GIN) (I nternet) ( http://www.g-i-n.net/ ): 2000-2014/03/25 National Guidelines Clearinghouse (Internet) ( http://www.guideline.gov/ ): up to 2014/03/25 NICE Guidance (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) (Internet) (http://guidance.nice.org.uk/ ): up to 2014/03/25 TRIP - Guidelines (Internet) ( http://www.tripdatabase.com/ ): up to 2014/03/25 Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 28 Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Hea lth (CADTH) (Internet) (http://www.cadth.ca/ ): up to 2014/03/25 PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of S ystematic Reviews) (Internet) (http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/ ): up to 2014/04/08 International Information Network on New and Emer ging Health Technologies (EuroScan) (Internet) ( http://www.euroscan.org.uk/ ): up to 2014/04/08 4.1.2 cannabis Where appropriate, database-specific objectively-de rived randomised controlled trials filters, such as Wong 2006, 58 were applied to limit the searches to retrieve RCT s. No randomised trials were found for depression, so add itional searches for observational studies were carried out for this indication. The following databases were searched from inceptio n to up to 2014/04/04 PubMed (NLM) 1926-2014/0 4/11 CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Heal th Literature) (EBSCO): 1981- 2014/04/14 Science Citation Index (SCI) (Web of Science): 1900 -2014/04/15 AMED (ProQuest): 1985-2014//04/07 Cochrane Central Register Trials (CEN TRAL) (Wiley Online Library): issue 3/March 2014 Supplementary searches were conducted to identify g rey literature, and completed and ongoing trials in the following resources: International Association for Cannabinoid Medicines (IACM) (Internet) (http://www.cannabis-med.org/ ): up to 2014/04/07 IACM Database of Clinical Studies and Case Reports (Internet) ( http://www.cannabis- med.org/studies/study.php ): up to 2014/04/04 http://www.clinicaltrials.gov ): up to 2014/04/07 metaRegister of Controlled Trials (Internet) ( http://www.controlled-trials.com ): up to 2014/04/07 WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (Internet) (http://www.who.int/ictrp/en ): up to 2014/04/07 Full search strategies and results are presented in Appendix 1. Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 29 4.1.3 Adverse events from medicinal cannabis use Further focussed adverse events (AEs) searches were necessary following screening of the clinical effectiveness search results. Where furth er information was required, topic-specific searches were conducted: cardiovascular/respiratory disease, cancer, dependence, and psychotic disorder/schizophrenia. Each search stra tegy was tailored to each resource searched, combining cannabis search terms with sear ch terms for each of the indications listed above. In addition, a study design search fi lter for cohort and case-control studies was included. The searches were not limited by lan guage, date or publication status (unpublished or published). The following databases and resources were searched up to 2014/08/06 PubMed (NLM) 1926-2014/0 8/07 CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Heal th Literature) (EBSCO): 1981- 2014/08/07 Science Citation Index (SCI) (Web of Science): 1900 -2014/08/07 4.1.4 Handling of citations As a number of databases were searched, there was s ome degree of duplication. In order to manage this issue, the titles and abstracts of bibl iographic records were downloaded and imported into EndNote reference management software and duplicate records removed. Rigorous records were maintained as part of the sea rching process. Individual records within the Endnote reference libraries were tagged with se arching information, such as searcher, date searched, database host, database searched, st rategy name and iteration, theme or search question. This enables the information speci alist to track the origin of each individual database record, and its progress through the scree ning and review process. 4.1.5 Quality assurance within the search process For all searches undertaken by Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Information team, the main Embase strategy for each set of searches is indepen dently peer reviewed by a second Information Specialist, using the CADTH checklist. 59 4.2 I NCLUSION CRITERIA Studies that fulfilled the following criteria were eligible for inclusion: 4.2.1 Review of clinical effectiveness: Population People with any of the following conditions: 1) Nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy 2) HIV/AIDS Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 30 3) Chronic pain (e.g. neuropathic pain, migraine, back pain) 4) Spasticity due to multiple sclerosis or paraplegia 5) Depression 6) Anxiety disorder 7) Sleep disorder 8) Psychosis 9) Glaucoma 10) Movement disorders due to Tourette syndrome Intervention Any form of cannabis for medical use. Comparators Usual care, placebo or no treatment. Outcomes For most populations inclusion was not restricted b ased on outcome. Only studies in patients with HIV/AIDS that reporte d data on outcomes related to appetite were eligible; for patients with depression only st udies that reported data on outcomes related to depression were eligible; and for patien ts with glaucoma, only studies that reported data on intraocular pressure were eligible . Study designs Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including rand omised cross-over trials. Cross-over trials were only included if they fulfilled the fol lowing criteria that we considered to define a cross-over trial: included random treatment orders and were balanced in design i.e. participants received the same number of treatments . For populations for which no RCTs were available lower levels of evidence were consid ered based on the following hierarchy: 1) Observational studies with concurrent control group s 2) Observational studies with non-concurrent control g roups 3) Uncontrolled studies (such as case series) with at least 25 patients 4.2.2 Review of adverse events: All studies included for objective 1 (review of cli nical effectiveness) contributed data on short term adverse events to the review of adverse events. Long term adverse events of interest included developing cardiovascular or resp iratory diseases or cancers, dependence, precipitating psychotic disorders including schizop hrenia. Data on long term adverse event were not available from the studies included for ob jective 1. We therefore included lower levels of evidence for these outcomes according to the following hierarchy: 1) Observational studies with concurrent control group s 2) Observational studies with non-concurrent control g roups Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 31 3) Uncontrolled studies (such as case series) with at least 25 patients For both review objectives, we had planned that any high quality systematic reviews (rated low risk of bias on all ROBIS domains 60 that fulfilled all review inclusion criteria and i ncluded all relevant studies for any single population woul d have been included. However, none of the identified reviews fulfilled these criteria and so all identified systematic reviews were used as sources of potentially relevant studies. 4.3 M ETHODS OF STUDY SELECTION , DATA EXTRACTION AND QUALITY ASSESSMENT 4.3.1 Study selection Titles and abstracts identified through electronic database and web searching were independently screened by two reviewers. We employ ed a two stage process to screen titles and abstracts. In the initial phase reviewe rs independently screened the full search results and selected any study that appeared to be an RCT or SR that reported on the effectiveness or adverse events of CBM in any patie nt group. A second mapping phase, also conducted independently by two reviewers, was then used to code the selected studies according to the population. Full text copies were obtained for all references relating to one or more of the populations specified in the inc lusion criteria. These were then independently examined in detail by two reviewers i n order to determine whether they met the criteria for inclusion in the review. All papers excluded at this second stage of the screening process were documented along with the re asons for exclusion (Appendix 2). Discrepancies between reviewers were resolved throu gh discussion or the intervention of a third reviewer. 4.3.2 Data extraction Data were extracted using standardised data extract ion forms developed in Microsoft Access 2010 (Appendix 2). Data extraction forms we re piloted on a small sample of papers and adapted as necessary. In order to minimise bia s and errors, data extraction was performed independently by two reviewers. We extracted baseline data on the following variabl es: funding sources (public, industry, mixed), study design, recruitment dates, patient ca tegory (nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy, HIV/AIDS, chronic pain, spasticity du e to multiple sclerosis or paraplegia, depression, anxiety disorder, sleep disorder, psych osis, glaucoma, movement disorders due to Tourette syndrome), inclusion and exclusion crit eria, age, sex, ethnicity, weight, disease severity, disease duration, concomitant medication, previous medication, comorbidities, previous drug or tobacco use, previous cannabis use , study duration and withdrawals. We extracted results for the following outcomes: 1. Patient relevant/disease specific outcomes: nausea and/or vomiting, appetite, weight, pain, sleep, depression, anxiety, spasticit y, psychosis, eye pressure, tic severity, balance and falls. 2. Activities of daily living Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 32 3. Quality of life and global impression of change 4. Adverse events (AEs): number of patients with at le ast one AE, withdrawals due to AEs, serious AEs, MedDRA high level group terms 61 (reproductive system and breast disorders; skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders; other body systems; ear and labyrinth disorders; blood disorders; injury, poiso ning & procedural complications; metabolism & nutrition disorders; neoplasms, ad ministration site disorders; nervous system disord ers) and specific adverse events (anxiety, asthenia (weakness), balance, confusion, death, depression, diarrhoea, disorientation, dizziness, dry mouth, dyspnoea, eup horia, fatigue, hallucinations, nausea, paranoia, psychosis, seizures, somnolence/d rowsiness, vomiting) We extracted dichotomous data as number of patients with events and/or number of events and total number of patients in each treatme nt arm. For categorical data, we extracted details on the categories assessed, the t otal number of patients in each treatment arm and the number of patients in each outcome cate gory. For continuous data we extracted means/medians together with ranges, stand ard deviations (SD), standard errors (SE) and/or confidence intervals (CIs) for the outc ome at baseline, follow-up and for change from baseline in each treatment group. For all typ es of data, summary effect estimates together with 95% CIs and p-values for comparisons between groups together with details on the methods of analysis, any variables controlle d for in the analysis and the test statistic were extracted. For cross-over trials, we developed a hierarchy of the type of data to be extracted. This is because cross-over trials rarely reported data in t he appropriate format using the appropriate analysis for studies of this design. I deally, for continuous data we extracted the mean and associated measure of variance (SD, SE or CI) or p-value for between group differences based on a paired analysis, if this was not available we extracted continuous data in the standard format for the whole trial (pe riods 1 and 2 combined) and for period 1 only, if reported. For dichotomous data, our prefer red data format was data to populate a 2x2 table for cross-over trials that would allow ca lculation of a Mantel-Haenszel OR, 62 alternatively we selected a summary effect estimate (OR or RR) with associated measure of variance (SE or CI) and p-value based on paired ana lysis (e.g. McNemar's test), if these were not available we extracted dichotomous data in the standard format for the whole trial and for period 1 only, if reported. Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 33 Any additional outcomes, including adverse events, reported in the studies but not specified as outcomes to extract for this review were listed but numerical results were not extracted. If data were reported for multiple time points we o nly extracted data for the time point defined as the \"primary analysis\". If this was not defined we selected the latest time point with the most complete data. We extracted data for the most complete population available i.e. we extracted intention to treat (ITT ) data or modified ITT data in preference to per-protocol analysis. For trials with multiple tr eatment arms we extracted data for each treatment compared to the CBM; i.e. if there was an active comparator and placebo arm we did not extract data comparing the active comparato r to placebo but for the CBM vs placebo, and CBM vs active comparator. We used all sources available to extract data so if a study was available as a full journal article, abstract and clinical trial registry entry we used data from all three. We selected the journal article as the primary publication as this had been peer-reviewed i.e. if there were any discrepancies between the data reported in the journal article and the trial registry entry or study abstract we selected the data from t he journal article. 4.3.3 Quality assessment RCTs were assessed for methodological quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool (Appendix 3b). 63 This includes items covering selection bias (rando m sequence generation and allocation concealment), performance bias (part icipant blinding), detection bias (blinding of outcome assessors) attrition bias (inc omplete outcome data), and reporting bias (selective reporting). We used the new Cochrane risk of bias tool for non- randomised studies (ACROBAT-NRS) to assess the risk of bias in observational studies. 64 This is currently under development and we contributed to the piloting of this tool. It in cludes domains covering bias due to confounding, bias in the selection of participants into the study, bias due to departures from intended interventions, bias due to missing data, b ias in taking measurements, and bias in selection of the reported result. For both tools, if at least one of the domains was rated as \"high\" the study was considered at high risk of bias, if all domains were judged as \"low\" the trial was considered at low risk of bias, otherwise the trial was considered at \"unclea r\" risk of bias. The risk of bias assessment was conducted as part of the data extraction proces s. Detailed guidance on how to assess trials for risk of bias specific to this review is provided in Appendix 3. 4.4 A NALYSIS 4.4.1 Narrative synthesis methods A narrative summary of the included studies was pre sented. This included a summary of the characteristics (e.g. study aim, study design, population size, geographical location, year, baseline population characteristics, outcome definition and assessments). Where data were considered too heterogeneous to pool, or not r eported in a format suitable for pooling (e.g. data reported as medians), we employed a narr ative synthesis. This involved the use of Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 34 descriptive text and tables to summarise data in or der to allow the reader to consider outcomes in the light of differences in study desig ns and potential sources of bias for each of the studies being reviewed. Studies were grouped according to patient category (nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy, HIV/AIDS, chronic pain, spasticity due to multiple sclerosis or paraplegia, depression, anxiety disord er, sleep disorder, psychosis, glaucoma, movement disorders due to Tourette syndrome), the r esults of the studies (range and size of the associations reported) were summarised, and the most important characteristics of the included studies were described. A detailed co mmentary on the results of the risk of bias assessment, including the major methodological problems or biases that affected the studies, was included. 4.4.2 Quantitative analysis and meta-analysis meth ods For dichotomous data we calculated the odds ratio ( OR) for each trial with the associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous data , where sufficient information was reported, we calculated the mean difference between groups, either at follow-up or in change from baseline, and associated 95% CIs. For multi-arm studies, we compared results for each treatment compared to the CBM. Where sufficient studies assessed similar populatio ns and outcomes, a formal meta-analysis was used to estimate summary measures of effect. W e anticipated that systematic differences between studies (heterogeneity) would b e likely. Therefore, the random-effects model was used to calculate summary estimates. Het erogeneity was investigated visually using forest plots and statistically using the I 2 and Q statistics. 65 For continuous outcomes, we selected mean difference in change from baseline if available. If this was not reported and could not be calculated from available data the n we used the mean difference at follow- up. In order to avoid double counting we selected a single data set from each study to contribute to meta-analyses. For studies evaluatin g multiple interventions we selected the intervention or dose that most similar to other int erventions being evaluated in that meta- analysis. We had planned to formally investigate heterogeneit y using meta-regression, however, there were insufficient data for any single outcome to perform such analyses. Small study effects (publication bias) was assessed using a modified linear regression test for funnel plot asymmetry as recommended by Harbord et al (2005) where there were sufficient numbers of trials (i.e. six trials). 66 Statistical analyses were performed using Stata (ve rsion 10) and the MetaXL add on for Microsoft Excel. 4.5 GRADE FRAMEWORK GRADE presents a systematic and transparent framewo rk for clarifying questions, determining the outcomes of interest, summarising t he evidence that addresses a question, and moving from the evidence to a recommendation or decision. 67-69 It rates the quality of a complete body of evidence for a specific outcome in a specific population. The quality of Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 35 evidence was assessed for risk of bias, publication bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, magnitude of effect, dose-response gr adient and the effects of any confounding. Risk of bias describes any limitations in the desig n and execution of a collection of studies, for example failure to properly randomise the parti cipants, failure to blind participants and investigators or selective reporting of outcomes (s ee section on Quality assessment). Publication bias is a measure of the degree to whic h the available published data are skewed by selective publication of trials dependent on their results, e.g. positive trials are more likely to be published than those with negativ e results (see section on Analysis). Imprecision assesses the degree to which random err or influences the interpretation of the results. Inconsistency captures the degree of heterogeneity between studies in terms of their PICO elements, i.e. how comparable are the studies to ea ch other (see section on Analysis). The remaining GRADE criteria can be used to rate up the quality of evidence if there is a very large effect of intervention, if there is evidence of a dose response or if the effects of any confounding would reduce rather than increase any o bserved effects. Each of the GRADE criteria was described in detail in a series of papers published by the GRADE working group. 70 Appendix 4a presents GRADE definitions, categorie s, and factors affecting the quality of evidence. GRADE is current ly the most widely accepted and used framework for developing guidelines. More than 50 o rganisations worldwide, many highly influential, have endorsed the framework ( http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/ ). We developed GRADE evidence profiles and summary of findings tables to summarise the evidence and rate the quality of evidence separatel y for each population (nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy, HIV/AIDS, chronic pai n, spasticity due to multiple sclerosis or paraplegia, depression, anxiety disorder, sleep disorder, psychosis, glaucoma, movement disorders due to Tourette syndrome). Summary of findings tables are presented at the end of the relevant results section while evidence profiles are presented in Appendix 10. Bot h present relevant results from parallel group studies. Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 36 5. RESULTS The primary searches for objective 1 identified 15, 786 hits of which 423 were considered potentially relevant and obtained as full text stud ies. Depression was the only indication of interest for which no relevant RCTs were identified . Additional focused searches were conducted to identify eligible non-randomised studi es for this indication. These searches did not find any potentially relevant studies even when going to the lowest level of evidence specified as eligible for the review (uncontrolled studies with at least 25 patients). We also conducted additional searches to identify studies o n the long term adverse events associated with cannabis use. These searches ident ified 5085 of which 70 were considered potentially relevant and obtained as full text stud ies. Full details of the search strategies used are available in Appendix 1. In total we scre ened 21 846 titles and abstracts and retrieved 493 full text studies. A total of 76 studies available as 147 reports were included in the review of effectiveness (objective 1) and 31 studies available as 46 report s were included in the review of long-term adverse events (objective 2). Most studies include d for objective 1 also reported data on short-term adverse events and so were also included for objective 2. A further 42 studies (44 reports) appeared to fulfil the inclusion crite ria but these were available only as trial registry entries and reports of results of these st udies were not found. Details of these studies are reported in Appendix 2. We also identi fied 42 SRs (45 publications). We had specified that if high quality systematic reviews w ere identified for any of the patient groups of interest that fulfilled all inclusion criteria f or the review and included all relevant studies then these would be eligible for inclusion. None o f the SRs identified by the searches fulfilled these criteria and so identified SRs were used as a source of relevant studies. Figure 2 summarises the flow of studies through the review process. Details of the 207 papers excluded after full text screening are liste d in appendix 3 alongside the reason for exclusion. We were unable to obtain seven reports, details of these are provided in appendix 4.

All other patient categor ies were evaluated in less than five studies. Thirty-two studies were parallel group studies (4,3 97 participants) and 44 were cross-over trials (1,983). The parallel group trials generall y enrolled greater number of participants than the cross-over trials (median 70, range 13 to 657 in the parallel group trials; median 48, range 6 to 214 in the cross-over trials). Many of the included studies were very old. Date of publication ranged from 1975 to 2014 (median 2004) with one third of trials published before 1990. Studies were conducted in wide range of countries including Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Ireland, F inland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Romania, Spain, Switzerland, UK, and USA. Twenty-s even studies were funded by the drug manufacturer, 15 were mixed funded between industry and public bodies, 19 were funded by public bodies and 15 did not provided informatio n on source of funding. Seven studies were available only as conference abstracts; 1, 71-76 all other studies were available as full reports, some including multiple publications inclu ding full results available as trial registry entries. Nineteen studies were multi-centre trials , 17 of these were parallel group trials 2-5, 77-89 and two were cross-over trials.90, 91 Sample sizes in these studies tended to be larger than in the single group studies (median 177, range 52-657 in the multi-centre studies; median 35, range 6-152). The majority of the studi es were restricted to adults but two of the studies 92, 93 that evaluated CBM for nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy were conducted in children and a further study also incl uded children. 94 Duration of follow-up ranged from 1.47 hours in a study of anxiety 95 to 15 weeks in a study of chronic pain. 81 Full baseline details of all included studies are provid ed in Appendix 5, full results are provided in Appendix 7. The included studies used a wide va riety of outcomes to measure the effects of CBM. On some a low score indicates a good outco me while on others this indicates a bad outcome, this can make results difficult to interpr et. To facilitate interpretation of results, we have provided an overview of the outcome measure s used in the included studies including the scale on which these are measures and whether a positive mean difference favours CBM or control (Appendix 9). 5.1.2 Overview of interventions evaluated in includ ed studies The interventions evaluated by the included trials are summarised in Table 1, full details are provided in Appendix 6. Cannabis was evaluated in a variety of different forms. These included oral formulations of cannabidiol (CBD), or nabiximols (a c ombination of THC/CBD). Of the 76 included studies, 53 included a placebo control. A variety of active comparators were included in the trials, with some including both ac tive comparator and placebo. 39 prochlorperazine. Active comparators were generall y only evaluated in single trials, the exception was prochlorperazine which was evaluated in 15 of the nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy trials. Most trials included only two treatment arms comparing CBM to placebo or active comparison. Some trials included multiple treatment arms comparing CBM to active comparison and placebo, comparing mor e than one different from of CBM to placebo or comparing different doses of the same fo rm of CBM to placebo. One study included five treatment arms comparing four differe nt doses of THC to placebo. 96 TABLE 1: INTERVENTION EVALUATED BY THE STUDIES INCLUDED IN TH E REVIEW Intervention Administration Method Number of studies CBM Cannabidiol (CBD) Capsules (oral) 4 THC Capsules (oral) 10 THC/CBD Capsules (oral) 4 CT3 Capsules (oral) 1 Dronabinol (Marinol) Capsules (oral) 13 Nabilone (Cesamet) Capsules (oral) 19 Levonantradol Capsules (oral) 1 Cannabis Vaporised 1 Marijuana Smoked Smoked Nabiximols (Sativex) Oromuscosal 6 Combination (Marinol) + megestrol acetate Capsules (oral) 1 Dronabinol ondansetron Capsules (oral) 1 Dronabinol (Marinol) + prochlorperazine Capsules (o ral) 1 Comparator interventions Alizapride Capsules (oral) 1 Amisulpride Capsules (oral) 1 Amitriptyline Capsules (oral) 1 Chlorpromazine IM 2 Dihydrocodeine Capsules (oral) 1 Domperidone Capsules (oral) 1 Domperidone Oromuscosal spray 1 Hydroxizine oral 1 Megestrol acetate Capsules (oral) 1 Metoclopramide IM 1 Ondansetron Capsules (oral) 1 Prochlorperazine Capsules (oral) 15 Placebo Capsules (oral) 27 Placebo Oromuscosal spray 19 Placebo Smoked 5 Placebo Vaporised 1 Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 40 5.1.3 Risk of bias Figure 3 summarises the risk of bias across include d trials. Only four (5%) trials were judged at low risk of bias overall, 52 (68%) were judged a t high risk of bias, and 20(26%) at unclear risk of bias. The major potential sources of bias in the trials was incomplete outcome data. Over 50% of trials reported relatively large number s of withdrawals and did not adequately account for this in the analysis by using an approp riate intention to treat (ITT) analysis based on all randomised participants. Instead of using a full ITT analysis studies often reported a modified ITT analysis based on the number of patien ts randomised who received at least one dose of the study medication. Selective outcom e reporting was a potential risk of bias in 16% of trials. These studies did not report dat a for all outcomes specified in the trial register, protocol or methods section of the review or changed the primary outcome from that which had been pre-specified. Other domains w ere only rated as high risk of bias in a small proportion (<7%) of trials. However, very fe w studies provided sufficient information to judge whether appropriate methods were used to r andomise participants or conceal treatment allocation. Blinding was also poorly rep orted in the included studies. Almost all studies reported that they were double blinded but only 52% provided sufficient information to judge that appropriate methods had b een used to blind participant/personnel and only 22% provided details that suggested that outcome assessors had been appropriately blinded. Full details of th e risk of bias assessments for individual trials, including the support for judgements, are p rovided in Appendix 8. A summary of the risk of bias of studies included for each patient c ategory is provided within each results section (section 5.2.1-5.2.10). Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 41 FIGURE 3: RISK OF BIAS ACROSS INCLUDED TRIALS 5.2 R ESULTS OF CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS REVIEW 5.2.1 Nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy Twenty-eight studies (37 publications; 1772 partici pants) evaluated CBM for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in adults and children under going chemotherapy (Table 2). 73, 74, 83, 85, 90-94, 97-124 The majority of the studies were restricted to ad ults but two studies were conducted in children 92, 93 and a further study also included children. 94 The studies included patients with a variety of cancers. Some were rest ricted to single cancer types such as testicular cancer 125 or lung cancer, 101 others included patients with a specific type of c ancer such as gastrointestinal 111 or advanced gynaecological cancers, 104 but most included mixed cancers. Studies restricted inclusion based on cer tain chemotherapy or previous anti-emetic treatment requirements such as having failed previo us anti-emetic treatment, being scheduled for two identical courses of chemotherapy , previous chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting lasting >24 hours, receiving ch emotherapy with a high or moderate emetic potential, or the same chemotherapy as previ ous cycles. Studies were conducted in Canada, Ireland, Finland, France, Germany, Spain, U K and USA. Seven studies used a parallel group design (467 par ticipants) and 21 (1305) were cross-over trials. Nineteen of the cross-over trials evaluate d CBM or control for one chemotherapy cycle and then the other treatment for the next cyc le, one cross-over trial was 4 days in duration for each treatment period with a 4 day was hout, 112 and one did not provide any 0% 20% 60% 80% 100% Participant/ Personnel blinding Outcome assessor blinding Incomplete outcome data Selective outcome reporting Overall Low High Unclear Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 42 information on the duration of the treatment period or on follow-up. 113 The parallel group trials ranged in duration from 24 hours to 6 days a nd one included two chemotherapy cycles. 99 Fourteen studies evaluated nabilone (max dose 2-1 0mg/24h, most common dose 4mg/4h), six studies evaluated THC capsules (max do se 45mg/24h or 4x7-14mg/m 2), four evaluated levonantradol (1.5-4mg/day IM or 4mg/24h oral), three evaluated dronabinol (max dose 10-4mg/24 hours) and one evaluated nabixi mols (max 8 sprays in any 4 hour period every 24 hours). Most studies included an a ctive comparator these included procholorperazine in 15 studies (max dose 15-50 mg/ 24 hours), most common dose 40mg/24 hours) and chlorpromazine (max 37.5mg/24 ho urs). Other comparators were only evaluated in a single studies and included domperid one oromucosal spray (max dose 45mg/day), oral domperidone (max dose 60mg/day), al izapride (max dose 450mg/day), hydroxyzine (max dose 300mg)/24 hours), metoclopram ide (IM, max dose 30mg/24 hours, and ondansetron (max dose 15mg/24 hours). Eight st udies, including three that also included an active control, included a placebo cont rol group. Two studies included a combination therapy arm of a CBM and other treatmen t (dronabinol+ondansetron and dronabinol +Prochlorperazine). 5.2.1.1 Risk of bias The risk of bias was generally high (Table 3). Non e of the studies were rated as low risk of bias overall, 23 were judged at high risk of bias a nd five at unclear risk of bias. The main limitation in the included study related to incompl ete outcome data; nineteen studies were judged at high risk of bias for this domain. Other potential sources of bias included selective outcome reporting (judged at high risk of bias in t wo studies), concealment of treatment allocation (high risk of bias in one study) and bli nding of participants (high risk of bias in two studies) and outcome assessors (high risk of bias o n one study). Randomisation was rated as low or unclear risk of bias in all studies. Ver y few studies provided sufficient information to judge whether appropriate methods were taken to conceal treatment allocation or blind outcome assessors, these were rated as unclear in 2 7 and 26 of the 28 studies respectively.

The most commonly evaluated outcome measur e, assessed in five studies, was a complete response in nausea and vomiting generally defined as no vomiting and no or very little nausea. Two studies, one parallel group and one cross over trial, compared dronabinol and THC to prochlorperazine. Both reported a great er number of patients with a complete response in the CBM group but this only reached sta tistical significance in the cross-over trial (OR 25.2, 95% CI 1.4, 452.2). Three parallel group studies compared dronabinol or nabiximols to placebo and provided sufficient data on this outcome to allow pooling. One of these studies included two CBM arms - dronabinol al one and dronabinol combined with ondansetron. Results were similar for both treatme nt arms; we selected the data for the dronabinol arm as this was most similar to the othe r trials. 85 The summary estimate suggested a significantly greater number of partici pants with complete nausea and vomiting response among those taking CBM compared to placebo (OR 3.44, 95% CI 1.45, 8.1; Figure 4).

Only two studies provided this inf ormation, one parallel group study showed a significant difference in nausea intensity between groups in favour of nabilone compared to prochlorperazine (p=0.027) 106 and the cross-over trial showed no differences in nausea between groups. 113 For studies that did not provide a p-value for th e significance of observed differences across groups we used a chi 2 test to compare results across groups. Most comparisons showed no significant differences between groups. The only exceptions were levonantradol at a dose of 2mg which was assoc iated with significantly fewer vomiting episodes than chlorpromazine in a parallel group st udy, 103 THC was associated with less nausea intensity than prochlorperzine and placebo, 126 and THC and nabilone were associated with more patients experience complete a nd improved nausea and vomiting response than prochlorperazine. 94, 123 The latter three studies were cross-over trials.

None of the studies provided information to allow calculation of confidence intervals around mean differences betwee n treatments and so it was not possible to pool continuous data for this populatio n. The most commonly evaluated outcome was the number of episodes of vomiting. This was evaluated in 11 studies, two parallel group studies and three cross-over trials. 74, 85, 90, 92, 99, 101, 104-106, 108, 117 Nine studies, including one of the parallel group trials, reported significantly less (p<0.05) vomiting associated with CBM (THC, na bilone or dronabilon) compared to various comparators including hydrazine, domperidon e, prochlorperazine, and placebo. The remaining two studies did not report on the statist ical significance of the difference. Nausea severity/intensity was evaluated in nine studies, t wo parallel group trials and seven cross- over trials. 74, 85, 90, 92, 99, 105, 108, 112, 117 The studies compared THC, nabilone and dronabinol to hydroxyzine, domperidone, prochlorperzine, and plac ebo. All but one of the studies reported significant beneficial effects (p<0.05) of CBM compared to the comparator intervention. 99 Nausea duration was evaluated in four trials, two parallel group and two cross-over trials. One of the parallel group and o ne-crossover trial reported significant beneficial effects of dronabinol and nabilone compa red to placebo and alizapride (p<0.03). Appetite and food intake was assessed in four cross -over trials. 74, 91, 99, 117 One study found significant beneficial effects of THC compared to h ydroxyzine for all three outcomes assessed, 74 one reported significantly greater food intake wit h nabilone compared to placebo, 117 two reported beneficial effects of CBM compared to active comparators but did not report on the statistical significance of the r esults. 91, 99 Two studies provided a global interpretation of pat ient's functional status. Both reported significant beneficial effects in favour of CBM. O ne compared dronabinol alone and compared with ondansetron to placebo and reported s ignificantly greater improvements in ECOG assessments in the dronabinol groups (p=0.036) . 85 The other compared to nabilone to prochlorperazine and reported significantly bett er physician global impression in the nabilone group (<0.001). 106 Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 57 TABLE 7: RESULTS FOR CONTINUOUS OUTCOMES FROM STUDIES THAT EV ALUATED CBM FOR NAUSEA AND VOMITING DUE TO CHEMOTHERAPY Study Details Inter- vention Comparator Outcome MD at follow-up : Analysis Details Appetite & weight: Levitt(1982)117 Cross-over Nabilone Placebo Food intake ( 0 (no food intake) - 3 (more than usual)) 0.78 0.001 NR rank sum test Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 58 Study Details Inter- vention Comparator Outcome MD at follow-up : Analysis of episodes -1.1 Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 59 Study Details Inter- vention Comparator Outcome MD at follow-up : Analysis Details (hours) Medians Prochlor- perazine (Frequency 6 vs Severity/intensity Physician global impression (1 to 5 (scale meaning unclear - 1 appears best)) -1.2 0.001 ANOVA 5.2.1.6 Summary Overall there was some evidence that CBM reduces na usea and vomiting and improves appetite and functional status in patients receivin g chemotherapy treatment for various types of cancer. All studies reported beneficial e ffects on all outcomes assessed but these did not reach statistical significance in all studi es and some did report on the statistical Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 60 significance of their findings. The majority of th e studies were cross-over trials conducted in the 1980s and over 80% were judged at high risk of bias. These findings should therefore be interpreted with some caution. There were only suff icient data to pool results for one outcome, the number of patients showing a complete nausea and vomiting response. This showed a significant beneficial effect of CBM compa red to placebo (OR 3.44, 95% CI 1.45, 8.15, Table 8). There were insufficient data to in vestigate small study effects.

Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 62 5.2.2 HIV/AIDS Four studies (255 participants) evaluated CBM as a treatment for appetite stimulation in patients with HIV/AIDS (Table 10). 84, 88, 129, 130 Three studies (2,188 participants) included patients with MS and two included patients with par aplegia (25 participants) caused by spinal cord injury. All studies were conducted in the USA. Three RCTs used a parallel group design (243 partic ipants) and one (12 participants) was a cross-over trial. 130 Three trials specified a minimum weight loss as a n entry criterion. This ranged from 2.25-2.3 kg or 10% of body weight. S tudy duration ranged from 3 to 12 weeks. All studies evaluated dronabinol, three com pared to matched placebo and one compared to megestrol acetate. 88 Two studies included additional treatment arms. One of the placebo controlled trials also evaluated mariju ana cigarettes 129 and the active comparison trial also included a combined dronabino l/megestrol acetate treatment arm. 88 5.2.2.1 Risk of bias All studies were judged at high risk of bias (Table 11). Two studies were judged at high risk of bias for participant and outcome assessor blindi ng; the active comparison study and the marijuana arm of the other three arm study. The ot her trials did not provide information on blinding. Three trials were judged at high risk of bias for incomplete outcome data as they had a large proportion of withdrawals and did not a dequately account for this through use of an intention to treat analysis for all outcomes. All studies were judged at low risk of bias for selective outcome reporting. Method of randomi sation and allocation concealment were only reported in one study which was judged to be at low risk of bias. 129 Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 63 T ABLE 10: OVERVIEW OF STUDIES THAT EVALUATED CBM IN PATIENTS W ITH HIV /AIDS Study Details Country Design N Duration (weeks)* HIV entry criterion Intervention 1 Intervention 2 Comparator Abrams(2003) 129 USA Parallel group 67 3 Stable antiretroviral regimen for 8 weeks; stable viral load for 16 weeks Marijuana (smoked); (max cigarettes/day, 4% THC) Dronabinol (max 7.5mg/day) Placebo Beal (1995)84 USA Parallel group 139 6 1 AIDS defining event; loss 2.3 kg normal body bodyweight Dronabinol (5mg/day) Placebo Struwe(1993) 130 USA Cross-over 12 5 weeks (2 week washout) loss of 2.25 kg normal body weight but were at least 70% of ideal body weight Dronabinol (max 10mg/day) Placebo Timpone(199 7) 88 USA Parallel group 37 12 >10% weight loss or BMI that was low; stable antiretroviral regimen for 4 11: RISK OF BIAS IN HIV /AIDS STUDIES Study Details RISK OF BIAS Random sequence generation Allocation concealment Participant/ Personnel blinding Outcome assessor blinding Incomplete outcome data Selective outcome reporting Overall Abrams(2003)129 /frownface/?* /frownface/?* /frownface Beal (1995)84 ? ? /frownface /frownface /frownface *This judged at high risk of bias for bli nding for the marijuana cigarette group and unclear for the dronabinol group $This study was judged at high risk of bias for outc omes that were analysed on a per-protocol basis and low risk of bias for outcomes analysed on an ITT b asis Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 64 5.2.2.2 Dichotomous outcome results Only one study, a parallel group study, evaluated a dichotomous outcome related to the effectiveness of interventions for appetite stimula tion in patients with HIV (Table 12).84 This study suggested that a greater number of patients g ained weight with dronabinol treatment compared to placebo but the difference did not reac h statistical significance (OR 2.2, 95% CI 0.69, 7.27).

One placebo controlled study reported a significant beneficial effect of both dronabinol and marijuana (p=0.004 and 0.021) but data were only re ported as median weight at follow-up and so it was not possible to calculate an effect s ize for this trial. 129 Two further trials suggested a greater weight gain with dronabinol com pared to placebo but this did not reach statistical significance (p=0.14 and 0.13). The ac tive comparison trial suggested significantly greater weight gain with megestrol acetate compared to dronabinol (MD -8.5 (-9.18, -7.82)) and no difference between dronabinol and megestrol acetate combined and megestrol acetate alone. 88 There was also a suggestion of increased appetite with dronabinol based on two trials,84, 130 one of which used a cross-over design, 130 but this did not reach statistical significance. The cross-over trial reported a sign ificantly greater increase in the % body fat associated with dronabinol use (p=0.04). 130 Nausea and vomiting One placebo controlled parallel group study reporte d less nausea with dronabinol but the evidence for this was weak (p=0.26). 84 Global impression One placebo controlled parallel group study 84 also reported a suggestion of a greater improvement in Karnofsky performance status 131 in the dronabinol group compared to placebo. The cross-over trial found improvements i n functional limitations associated with dronabinol. 130 5.2.2.4 Summary There was some evidence that dronabinol is associat ed with an increase in weight compared to placebo. More limited evidence suggested that i t may also be associated with increased appetite, greater % body fat, reduced nausea, and i mproved functional status. However, Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 65 these outcomes were mostly assessed in single studi es and failed to reach statistical significance. One trial evaluated marijuana and dr onabinol, this study found significantly greater weight gain with both forms of cannabis com pared to placebo. An active comparison study found that megestrol acetate was a ssociated with greater weight gain than dronabinol and that combining dronabinol with megestrol acetate did not lead to additional weight gain.

Fourteen studies were parallel group studies (1980 participants) and 14 used a cross-over design (459 participants). Most (75%) studies spec ified a minimum level of pain as a study inclusion criterion. In most studies this was equi valent to a mean score 4 on a 0-10 NRS or VAS scale generally over the 6-7 days before study entry. Four studies specified a criterion of >4, one of >5, one of 3 and one a score of 5 o n the pain intensity subscale of the Descriptor Differential Scale (DDS). 181 Study duration ranged from 4 hours in a small cro ss- over trial 76 to 15 weeks in a large multicentre parallel group trial. 81 Thirteen studies evaluated nabiximols(max dose 4-48 sprays/24h), one evaluated THC (1-7%) oromucosal spray, 76 two evaluated dronabinol (max dose 10-20mg/day), 139, 146 four evaluated nabilone (max dose 0.5-2mg/day), 133, 140, 141, 143 one evaluated THC capsules (5-20mg/day), 96 one evaluated CT3 capsules (max 80mg/day), 147 one evaluated vaporised cannabis (8-12 puffs per day) 134 and three evaluated THC cigarettes (one cigarette/ day). 135, 137, 138, 142 Nine studies included multiple intervention arms with di fferent doses of the intervention evaluated in different arms. One study evaluated t wo different doses of dronabinol (10mg and 20mg), 139 one evaluated different doses of THC (5mg, 10mg, 1 5mg and 20mg), 96 of nabiximols (1-4 sprays , 6-10 sprays and 11-16 sprays), 86 two evaluated nabiximols and THC spray, 82, 145 one evaluated different concentrations of THC spray (7%, 4% and 1%), 76 one evaluated different concentrations of vaporise d cannabis (3.53% and 1.29%), 134 and two evaluated different concentrations smok ed THC (3.5% and 7%, and 2.5%, 6% and 9.4%). 138, 176 One study compared CBM (nabilone) to the active comparator amitriptyline, 133 all other studies compared the CBM evaluated to a matched placebo control group. One study that evaluated na bilone included an active comparator (dihydrocodeine) as well as a placebo control group . 141 5.2.3.1 Risk of bias The risk of bias in the included studies was variab le (Table 16). Only two were rated as low risk of bias for all domains. 133, 134 A further nine were rated as unclear risk of bias . The main limitation in the included study related to incompl ete outcome data; fourteen studies were judged at high risk of bias for this domain. Other potential sources of bias included selective outcome reporting (judged at high risk of bias in f our studies) and concealment of treatment allocation (judged at high risk of bias in two stud ies). All other domains were rated as low or unclear risk of bias. Very few studies provided su fficient information to judge whether Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 69 appropriate methods were taken to conceal treatment allocation, outcome assessor blinding was also poorly reported.

The most commonly evaluated outcome was a 30% reduction in pain scores based on NRS or VAS scales, this was evaluated in 11 studies (8 par allel group and 3 cross-over studies). In order to calculate a summary estimate for this outc ome we selected one set of results from studies that evaluated multiple interventions. We selected the intervention or dose most comparable to other studies. For the study that ev aluated nabiximols and THC we selected the nabiximols data, for the study that evaluated d ifferent doses of nabiximols we selected the 11-14 spray dose, for the studies that evaluate d two different concentrations of smoked cannabis we selected the 3.5% concentration. The s ummary OR based on 8 parallel group studies suggested a beneficial effect of CBM but th is did not reach statistical significance (OR 1.35, 95% CI 0.95, 1.93; Figure 5). There was moderate evidence of heterogeneity (I 2=49%, p=0.06). Sensitivity analysis including the three cross-over trials found evidence for a beneficial effect of cannabis on pain (OR 1.60, 9 5% CI 1.11, 2.30; Figure 6) but there was greater heterogeneity (I 2=54%, p=0.016). Differences across studies did not appear related to type of CBM, underlying cause of pain, or risk o f bias. There was no evidence of small study effect based on the eight parallel group stud ies alone (p=0.304) or on all 11 studies (p=0.077). Three of the studies (2 parallel group and 1 cross-over) that evaluated a 30% or more improvement in pain scores also reported data for the number of participants with a 50% or more improvement in pain scores. 80, 81, 146 All suggested a beneficial effect of CBM but this only reached statistical significance in t he cross-over trial. 146 Other dichotomous pain outcomes were only evaluated in single studies , these are summarised in Table 17. Global impression Five parallel group studies, all assessing nabiximo ls, evaluated patient global impression of change. 1, 4, 77, 79, 144 Three reported dichotomous data on the number of patients reporting an improvement associated with treatment 1, 4, 79 and two reported categorical data. 77, 144 We dichotomised the data from the categorical studi es to calculate the number of patients who reported an improvement associated with treatme nt. The summary estimate suggested that nabiximols was associated with signi ficantly greater patients reported improvement compared to placebo (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1. 15, 3.28; Figure 7). There was strong evidence of heterogeneity (I 2=69%, p=0.01).

Outcome measures reported only in single trials included va rious types of total pain scores, peripheral neuropathic pain, superficial pain, pain at allodyn ic site, pain relief, spine pain, headache Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 80 intensity, punctuate allodynia, number of headache free days, dynamic allodynia, morning pain at rest of on movement, muscular pain, deep pa in, breakthrough analgesia use, unpleasantness, and radiating pain. These are summ arised in Table 18 and are not considered in more detail. In order to calculate summary estimates for some outcomes it was necessary to select one set of results from stu dies that evaluated multiple interventions. As with the analysis for dichotomou s outcomes, we selected the intervention or dose most comparable to other studies. For the study that evaluated nabiximols and THC we selected the nabiximols data, for the study that evaluated different doses of nabiximols we selected the 11-14 spray dose, for the studies t hat evaluated two different concentrations of smoked cannabis we selected the 3 .5% concentration, for the study that evaluated two doses of dronabinol we selected the 1 0mg dose, and for the studies that evaluated different doses of THC we selected the 10 mg dose. Pain The most commonly reported measure of pain was a 0- 10 numerical pain ratings score. This was assessed in 11 studies, six parallel group 1, 4, 80, 82, 86, 144 and five cross-over trials. 96, 135, 139, 146, 148 All but one of the cross-over trials provided dat a in sufficient detail to permit pooling. 139 This study reported a significant beneficial effe ct of dronabinol at two different doses compared to placebo, with a greater effect fo r the 20mg compared to the 10mg dose (-0.9 vs -1.5). 139 The summary weighted mean different based on the six parallel group studies suggested a significant beneficial improvem ent in pain scores associated with CBM (WMD -0.46, 95% CI -0.80, -0.11, Figure 8). There was moderate evidence of heterogeneity (I 2=59%, p=0.03). Sensitivity analysis that included the cross-over trials also showed a significant beneficial effect of CBM (WMD -0.57, 95 % CI -0.93, -0.22, Figure 9) but heterogeneity increased (I 2=67%, p<0.01). There was evidence of small study e ffects for the analysis based on the parallel group studies alone (p=0.02) but not for the analysis based on all 10 studies (p=0.172).

The most commonly reported subscale was the severity composite index which was evaluated in four of the six trials, with sufficient data to permit pooling in three trials. The summar y effect size suggested a small beneficial effect of cannabis on pain but this did not reach s tatistical significance (WMD -0.17, 95% CI - 0.50, 0.16, Figure 10). There was no evidence of h eterogeneity (I 2=0%). Six studies, 1, 76, 137, 138, 141, 183 five cross-over trials and one parallel group st udy, evaluated changes in pain using various measures on the descr iptor differential scale. 181 None of these studies provided a measure of effect with associate d confidence interval but all provided p- values for the difference between CBM and placebo a nd suggested a significant beneficial effect of CBM in reducing pain (p-values ranged fro m 0.04 to 0.007). Five studies, two parallel group trials and three c ross-over trials, used the McGill pain rating scale 184 to evaluate pain. Generally the studies showed n o difference between CBM and placebo, although two studies found some evidence o f significant beneficial effects in favour of CBM. One parallel group study showed a signific ant beneficial effect on the VAS scale of the McGill pain rating (MD -0.72, 95% CI -1.30, -0. 14) but not on total pain intensity. 78 One of the cross-over trials that evaluated both THC an d nabiximols compared to placebo reported a significantly beneficial effect of THC c ompared to placebo but found no significant difference for nabiximols. The only st udy to compare CBM (nabilone) to an active comparator (amitriptyline) assessed pain using this rating scale. This cross-over trial found no difference between nabilone and amitriptyline. Seven parallel group trials assessed pain using the neuropathic pain scale. 4, 77, 80, 81, 136, 142, 144 Five of these trials provided data on suitable form at to allow data to be pooled. 77, 80, 81, 136, 144 All but one suggested a beneficial effect of CB M but this only reached statistical significance in one. The pooled estimates suggeste d a significant beneficial effect of nabiximols in reduced neuropathic pain compared to placebo (WMD -3.89, 95% CI -7.32, - 0.47, Figure 11). There was some evidence of heter ogeneity (I 2=41%, p=0.15). One of the studies that did not contribute to the meta-analysi s also suggested a significant beneficial effect of THC, 142 the other found no difference between nabiximols a nd placebo. 4 Four studies, three parallel group and one-cross-ov er trial, measured pain using the pain disability index (PDI). 4, 79, 80, 145 All compared nabiximols to placebo. Three sugges ted a beneficial effect of nabiximols on the PDI although this only reach statistical significance in one (MD -5.85, 95% CI -9.62, -2.09). 80 One trial suggested a harmful effect of nabiximol s but this was of borderline significance (p=0.058), this study did not report a confidence intervals and so there were insufficient data to pool results from the parallel group studies for this outcome. Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 83 Two cross-over trials evaluated pain using a VAS sc ale, both reported strong evidence for a beneficial effect of cannabis (p<0.002), however, t hese studies did not provide confidence intervals around the mean difference. Two studies, one crossover trial and one parallel group study, evaluated pain using the 11 item pain box scale. 145, 185 The cross-over trial found a significant difference between groups (p=0. 005) but the parallel group study found no differences between groups (p<0.05).

Quality of life was measured using a vari ety of different measures. Measures used in multiple studies included EQ-5D (5 studies), 186 SF-36 (5 studies), 187 Spitzer QoL (2 studies).188 On all these tools lower scores are associated wi th worse outcomes meaning that a higher score or positive MD favours CBM, thi s is in contrast to most pain outcomes where a lower score generally favours CBM. Five studies, four parallel group studies and one c ross-over trial, evaluated QoL using the EQ-5D with most reporting data for both the health status index and health status VAS. 4, 77, 81, 135, 136 Four parallel group studies suggested a very smal l negative effect nabiximols on EQ-5D health status index compared to placebo but t his did not reach statistical significance in any of the studies. Three studies reported data in a format suitable for pooling. The summary estimate showed no difference between treat ment groups (WMD -0.01, 95% CI - 0.05, 0.02; Figure 12). There was no evidence of h eterogeneity (I 2=0%, p=0.82). FIGURE 12: FOREST PLOT SHOWING WMD (95% CI) FOR EQ -5D HEALTH STATUS INDEX FOR PARTICIPANTS TAKING CBM COMPARED TO PLACEBO Five studies, three cross-over trials and two paral lel group studies, 4, 136, 141, 146, 148 evaluated QoL using the SF-36 which included various subscale s. The studies generally found little evidence for an effect of CBM on SF-36 results, wit h most results showing no differences between groups. Two parallel group studies evaluated the Spritzer Q oL index.1, 79 Neither reported a significant difference between nabiximols or placeb o for this outcome.

Studies generally suggested a beneficial effect of CBM on m easures of pain but this did not reach statistical significance in most individual studies . Summary estimates for outcomes where there were sufficient data to permit pooling sugges ted a significant beneficial effect of cannabis on all measures both dichotomous and conti nuous (Table 19). Dichotomous data suggested a significant beneficial effect of CBM on patient global impression of change. There was some evidence to support this based on co ntinuous data but this was not consistent across trials. Sensitivity analyses tha t included cross-over trials in the meta- analyses showed results consistent with those based on parallel group trials alone. Pain measured using a numerical rating scale was the onl y outcome where sufficient data were available to investigate the presence of small stud y effects. There was no evidence of small study effect from the analysis where this outcome w as dichotomised (p=0.304 for parallel group studies only). For pain NRS as a continuous measure, there was evidence of small study effects for the analysis based on the paralle l group studies alone (p=0.02) but not for the analysis based on all ten studies (p=0.172).

Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 99 5.2.4 Spasticity due to multiple sclerosis (MS) or paraplegia Twelve studies (31 reports; 2213 participants) eval uated CBM as a treatment for spasticity due to MS or paraplegia (Table 21).1-5, 71, 87, 89, 128, 151, 164, 189-208 Ten studies (2188 participants) included patients with MS and two inc luded patients with paraplegia (25 participants) caused by spinal cord injury. A numb er of studies also provided data on outcomes relating to sleep 3-5, 87, 190, 192, 209 , chronic pain 4, 87 and depression.3 Data for these outcomes are considered under the relevant sections and are not reported further in this section. Eight RCTs used a parallel group design (2,091 part icipants) and four (122 participants) were cross-over trials. Most studies specified a minimu m level of spasticity for inclusion in the trial. This ranged from 2 or 3 on the Ashworth sc ore with some studies specifying that this should apply to at least one limb or joint, two or more muscle groups or at the elbow, hip or knee. One study specified a score of 4 on a spast icity numerical rating scale (NRS) for at least 6 days. 5 Study duration ranged from 3 days for each treat ment period in one of the cross-over trials to 15 weeks in one of the paralle l group trials. Five studies evaluated nabiximols (max dose 12-48 sprays/24h), 1-5 three evaluated dronabinol (max dose 10- 25mg/day), 71, 89, 193 two of these also evaluated CBD/THC capsules (max dose 10- 25mg/day), 89, 193 an additional two evaluated CBD/THC alone (max dos e 25/30mg/day), 87, 192 one evaluated nabilone (max dose 1mg/day), 128 and one evaluated THC (4%) cigarettes (one 800mg cigarette/day). 190 All studies compared the CBM evaluated to a matche d placebo control group. 5.2.4.1 Risk of bias The risk of bias in the included studies was variab le (Table 22). Only two, by the same author, were rated as low risk of bias for all doma ins. 87, 89 A further five were rated as unclear risk of bias. One of these, available only as a conference abstract, did not report sufficient details to allow a judgement of high or low risk of bias to be made for any of the bias domains. 71 Two were rated as low risk of bias for all domain s except for allocation concealment for which insufficient details were rep orted to allow a judgement to be made. 4, 5 A further study did not provide details on alloca tion concealment of outcome assessor blinding but was rated as low risk bias for all oth er domains, 128 and one study did not provide details on randomisation, allocation concea lment or outcome assessor blinding. 2 Five studies were judged at high risk of bias. Lim itations in these studies related to incomplete outcome data and failure to use an ITT a nalysis to account for missing data 1, 3, 190, 192 and selective outcome reporting. 193 Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 100 TABLE 21: OVERVIEW OF STUDIES THAT EVALUATED CBM FOR SPASTICIT Y IN PATIENTS WITH MS AND PARAPLEGIA Study Details Country Design N Duration (weeks)* Condition Spasticity entry criterion Intervention 1 Intervention 2 Comparator Berman(2007) 1, 164 Romania, UK Parallel group 117 3 MS Not specified Nabiximols (Sativex); Max 48 sprays/24h Placebo Collin(2007) 2, 202 UK and Romania Parallel group 189 6 MS Spasticity in 2 muscle groups; Ashworth score2 Nabiximols (Sativex); sprays/24h Placebo Collin(2010)5, 198, 203 UK and Czeck republic Parallel group 337 14 MS Mean daily score 4 on spasticity NRS for 6 days Nabiximols (Sativex); max 24 sprays/24h Placebo Corey-Bloom(2012) 1 90, 200, 208 USA Cross-over 37 3 days (11 day washout) MS Ashworth score 3 at the elbow, hip, or knee; THC; one 800mg cigarette Placebo Hagenbach(2003) 71 Switzerland Parallel group 13 6 Paraplegia (spinal cord injury) Ashworth score >3 Dronabinol (Marinol); max dose unclear appeared to be 10mg daily Placebo Killestein(200 2) 193, 196 Netherlands Cross-over 16 4 (4) MS Ashworth score 2 in at least one limb THC/CBD capsules; max dose 10mg/day Dronabinol (Marinol); max dose 10mg/day Placebo Langford(201 3) 4, 151 UK, Czech Republic, Canada, Spain Parallel group 339 14 MS Not specified Nabiximols (Sativex); max 12 sprays/24h Placebo Pooyania(201 0) 128, 205 Canada Cross-over 12 4 (2) Paraplegia (Spinal cord injury) Ashworth 3 Nabilone (Cesamet); max dose 1mg/day Placebo Vaney(2004) 19 2 Switzerland Cross-over 57 9 days (4 days) MS one joint scoring 2 on the Ashworth scale THC/CBD capsules; max dose 30mg/day Placebo Wade(2004)3, 199, 204 UK Parallel group 160 6 MS Not specified Nabiximols (Sativex); max 48 sprays/24h Placebo Zajicek(2003) 8 9, 189, 191, 206 UK (CAMS study) Parallel group 657 15 MS Ashworth score of 2 in 2 limb muscle groups THC/CBD capsules; max 25mg/day Dronabinol (Marinol); max 25mg/day Placebo Zajicek(2012)8 7, 194, 195, 197, 201, 207 UK (MUSEC study) Parallel group 279 12 MS Not specified THC/CBD capsules; max 25mg/day Placebo Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 101 TABLE 22: RISK OF BIAS IN MS AND PARAPLEGIA STUDIES Study Details RISK OF BIAS Random sequence generation Allocation concealment Participant/ Personnel blinding Outcome assessor blinding Incomplete outcome data Selective outcome reporting Overall Berman(2007)1 ? ? ? /frownface /frownface Collin(2007) 2 ? ? ? ?

All suggested a beneficial effect of C BM, this reached statistical significance in three studies. 2, 87, 89 Two parallel group studies, both by the same auth or and assessing nabiximols, evaluated the number of patients who re ported a 50% reduction or 30% reduction in spasticity symptoms as assessed on a 0 -10 NRS. Summary estimates for these outcomes suggested a beneficial effect of nabiximol s but this did not reach statistical significance (Figure 13 and Figure 14). General disease specific symptoms One parallel group study also reported a significan t beneficial effect on muscle stiffness, 87 and a further parallel group study reported a sugge stion of a reduction in the incidence of MS relapses but this did not reach statistical sign ificance for either THC/CBD capsules or dronabinol. 89 Global impression Four parallel group studies, all evaluating nabixim ols, assessed patient global impression, one also assessed carer global impression. All sug gested a beneficial effect of nabiximols but this only reached statistical significance in o ne. The summary estimate ( Figure 15 ) suggested a significant beneficial effect of nabi ximols on patient global impression (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.12, 2.82). However, there was moderate heterogeneity across studies (I 2 =58%, p=0.43) and so this should be interpreted wi th some caution.

Outcome m easures reported only in single trials are summarised in Table 24 and are not considered i n more detail. Spasticity The most commonly reported measure of spasticity wa s the Ashworth scale or modified Ashworth scale, 210 we defined this as the primary outcome measure for spasticity. This assesses spasticity on a scale ranging from 0 (no i ncrease in muscle tone) to 5 (affected part(s) rigid in flexion and extension), a negative MD therefore indicates a beneficial effect of the CBD. All but one of the individual trials s uggested a beneficial effect of CBM on the Ashworth score but this only reached statistical si gnificance (p<0.05) in two trials. The summary WMB estimate based on five parallel group s tudies that reported data on the Ashworth scale was -0.14 (95% -0.27, -0.01; Figure 16). There was no evidence of heterogeneity (I 2=0%, p=0.52). We performed an additional sensitivi ty analysis where we included three cross-over trials that also reported results for spasticity assessed using the Ashworth scale. The summary WMD based on all eight (5 parallel group and 3 cross-over studies) that reported data for this outcome sugges ted a significant beneficial effect of CBM on spasticity assessed using the Ashworth scale (WM D -0.26 95% CI -0.47, -0.05; Figure 17). There was moderate evidence of heterogeneity (I 2 47%, p=0.07) and so this should be assessed with some caution. The Egger test for this outcome suggested no evidence of small study effects either based on the five parallel gro up studies alone (p=0.437) or on all eight studies (p=0.173).

We divided the results from the studies that used the VAS scale by 10 so that resul ts were on the same scale and could be combined with the studies that used NRS. All but o ne (a parallel group trial) 1 of the studies suggested a beneficial effect of CBM on spasticity but this only reached statistical significance in one parallel group trial.3 The summary effect estimate based on the four parallel group trials suggested a significant benef icial effect of CBM on spasticity assessed using an NRS or VAS but this did not reach statisti cal significance (WMD -0.52, 95% CI -1.11, 0.07; Figure 18). There was strong evidence of het erogeneity (I 2=73%, p=0.01). We performed an additional sensitivity analysis where we included the cross-over trial that also reported results for spasticity assessed using a VA S score. The summary effect estimate based on all five trials suggested a significant be neficial effect of CBM on spasticity assessed using an NRS or VAS (WMD -0.57, 95% CI -1.09, -0.05 ; Figure 19). There was strong evidence of heterogeneity (I 2=67%, p=0.02). Other measures of spasticity were n ot consistently reported; they were either only reported in a small number of studies or measures of variance were not reported (Table 24). Generally t he studies suggested a beneficial effect of CBM on spasticity for other outcomes but most did n ot reach statistical significance.

Mobility/Disability Three parallel group trials 3, 5, 89 evaluated activities of daily living using the Bar thel Index. 213 This is a 10 item scale that measures daily functio n and gives a score out of 20 with higher scores suggesting greater independence. All studie s suggested a negative effect of CBM but this did not reach statistical significance. The s ummary effect estimate suggested a negative effect but this did not reach statistical significa nce (WMD -0.46, 95% CI -0.96, 0.02; Figure 20).

Studies generally suggested a beneficial effect of CBM on measures of spasticity but this failed to reach statistical significance in most studies. The summ ary estimate for the Ashworth scale based on parallel group trials suggested a significant be neficial effect of CBM on spasticity (Table 25). For other measures of spasticity also suggest ed a beneficial effect but did not reach statistical significance. Dichotomous data suggest ed a significant beneficial effect of CBM on patient global impression of change, this was su pported by a further cross-over trial that provided continuous data for this outcome. There w ere no clear differences between the different types of CBM evaluated in these studies. Sensitivity analyses that included cross- over trials in the meta-analyses showed results con sistent with those based on parallel group trials alone. There was no evidence of small study effect based on the Ashworth scale, the only outcome for which sufficient data were ava ilable to allow investigation of this.

Additional searches were carried out f or this population with lower levels of evidence eligible for inclusion. These searches di d not locate any eligible studies. Five studies included for other sections of this re view reported on depression as an outcome measures. 3, 86, 139, 141, 144 Four of these studies evaluated patients with chr onic pain 86, 139, 141, 144 and one was conducted in patients with MS. 3 Three studies 3, 86, 144 were parallel group trials and two were cross-over trials. 139, 141 Full details of these trials, including the resul ts of the risk of bias assessment, are available in the a ppendices and the sections on chronic pain (section 5.2.3) and spasticity due to MS or paraple gia (section 5.2.4). 5.2.5.1 Continuous outcome results The studies used different depression rating scales (MADS, HADS and BDI), in all scales a higher score indicated more severe depression and t hus a negative MD favoured CBM while a positive MD favoured control. One of the cross-o ver trials reported data to calculate the MD change from baseline but did not provide any mea sure of variation or the statistical significance of the finding. Three studies (two pa rallel group trials and one cross-over trials) suggested no difference between CBM and placebo in depression outcomes (Table 27). One parallel group trial that compared different doses of nabiximols to placebo reported a negative effect of nabiximols for the highest dose (11-14 sprays per day) evaluated compared to placebo (MD from baseline 2.50, 95% CI 0.38, 4.62) but no difference compared to placebo for the two lower doses evaluat ed. 86 TABLE 27: RESULTS FOR CONTINUOUS OUTCOMES FROM STUDIES THAT EV ALUATED CBM FOR DEPRESSION Study Details Intervention Outcome MD at follow-up MD change from baseline $: p-value Analysis Details Depression outcomes reported in chronic pain/MS stu dies Portenoy (2012) 86 Parallel group Nabiximols (1- 4 sprays) Depression (MADRS) 1.80 (-0.32, 3.92) Nabiximols (6- 10 Nabilone HADS -0.2 (1.20, 0.9) Rog(2005) 144 Parallel group Nabiximols HADS depression score 0.15 (-1.0, 1.31) Wade(2004) 3 Parallel group Nabiximols Beck Depression Inventory 0.69 (-0.76, 2.14) Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 119 5.2.5.2 Summary There was no data available on the CBM for the trea tment of depression.

Participants were randomised to receive either cannabidiol or placebo before taking part in a simulated public speaking test. A further four trials (three cross- over and one parallel group) conducted in patients with chronic pain evaluated anxiety as an outcome. 140, 141, 144 Full details of these trials, including the results of the risk of bias a ssessment, are available in the appendices and the section on chronic pain (section 5.2.3). 5.2.6.1 Risk of bias This study was judged at high risk of bias (Table 3 0). The main limitation related to the method of randomisation and concealment of treatmen t allocation. The first participant were blindly allocated to one of the two treatment options available; the next participant (whose characteristics were matched to the first on e's based on gender, age, years of education, and socioeconomic status) were assigned to the remaining treatment option.

It should be noted that these studies did not restr ict inclusion based on symptoms of anxiety and so the included patients are not likely to have had an anxiety disorder. All four studies reported beneficial effects of CBM (nabilone, nabix imols or dronabinol) but this only reached statistical significance in one of the cros s-over trials. 140 One of the cross-over trials reported results for two different doses of dronabi nol compared to placebo. This study suggested a beneficial effect for the lower dose bu t a negative effect for the higher dose, however, neither result was statistically significa nt.

However, this study was very small and was judged at high risk of bias and should be interpreted with caution.

A further nineteen studies also reported outcomes r elated to sleep although did not restrict inclusion to participants with sleep disorders. Si x of these studies were conducted in patients with MS 3, 5, 87, 89, 190, 192 and fourteen in patients with chronic pain. 1, 4, 77-82, 86, 135, 141, 144, 145 Full details of these trials, including the result s of the risk of bias assessment, are available in the appendices and the sections on MS and paraplegia (section 5.2.4) and chronic pain (section 5.2.3). 5.2.7.1 Risk of bias One study was judged at low risk of bias 133 the other at high risk of bias (Table 34). The study judged at high risk of bias was the one avail able only as a conference abstract. 72 The main limitation with this study related to incomple te outcome data. Only very limited details were reported and this included stratifying results according to the dose to which patients titrated. It was only possible to extract usable data for 8 participants who titrated to the maximum dose of 10mg. This study did not pr ovide sufficient information to judge the risk of bias for most other domains.

One of the studies in patients with MS 87 evaluated sleep quality using a 0-10 NRS and provi ded information on the number of patients reporting an improvement in sleep (Table 35). A further study in MS patients by the same authors pr ovided categorical data on sleep where patients rated their sleep as improved, the same or deteriorated. 89 We dichotomised this data to show the number of patients with improved s leep (Table 35). Both studies reported a significant improvement in sleep associated with THC/CBD compared to placebo (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.2, 3.6 and OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.13, 2.73). T here was also a suggestion of a beneficial effect of dronabinol but this was of borderline sta tistical significance (OR 1.54, 95% CI 0.98, 2.42).

The cross-over trial 133 compared nabilone with amitriptyline. This study found a significantly greater improvement in the insomnia severity index (MD -3.25, 95% CI -5.26, -1.24) during the nabilone treatment phase compared to the amitriptyline treatment phase. Amitriptyline was associated with greater restfulness of sleep as assessed by the Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire (LSEQ) (MD 0.48 (0.01, 0.95)). 214 There as a suggestion that speed and ease of getting to sleep were improved with cannabis compared to amitriptyline but these differences did not reac h statistical significance. Sleep outcomes in studies conducted in other popula tions The most commonly reported measure was sleep qualit y assessed using a 0-10 NRS or 0-100 VAS scale (Table 36). We transformed the 0-100 VAS results to a 0-10 scale by dividing by 10 so that these were comparable to other studies e valuating this outcome. Ten studies, eight parallel group studies and two cross-over tri als, evaluated sleep quality. 3-5, 77, 81, 82, 87, 144, 145, 192, 215 Most suggested improvements in sleep associated w ith CBM but this only reached statistical significance in three parallel group trials. One of the cross-over trials also reported a significant difference between both nabi ximols and THC and placebo but it was unclear whether this favoured CBM or placebo. 145 The scale reported in the study Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 130 suggested that a positive MD (which the study repor ted) favoured placebo, however, the study reported that it had found improvements in sl eep associated with CBM. Seven of the parallel group studies reported data in a format su itable for pooling. One of these evaluated both Nabiximols and THC and so the data f or nabiximols were selected for pooling as this was the intervention most commonly evaluate d by these trials: all except one evaluated nabiximols, this evaluated oral THC/CBD. 82 The summary estimate suggested a significant improvement in sleep quality associated with CBM (WMD -0.58, 95% CI -0.87, - 0.29; Figure 23). There was little evidence of het erogeneity (I 2=33%, p=0.17). There was evidence of small study effects (p= 0.012). FIGURE 23: FOREST PLOT SHOWING WMD (95% CI) FOR SLEEP QUALITY FOR PARTICIPANTS TAKING CBM COMPARED TO PLACEBO IN THE PARALLEL GROUP STUDIES O NLY Five studies, four parallel group and one cross-ove r trial, evaluated changes in sleep disturbance. 1, 79, 80, 86 All but one reported reduced sleep disturbance as sociated with CBM, this reached statistical significance in two. Thre e parallel group studies reported sufficient data to pool studies. The summary estimate showed a significant beneficial effect in favour of CBM (WMD -0.26, 95% CI -0.52, 0.00, FIGURE 24 ). There was substantial evidence of heterogeneity (I 2=64%, p=0.06). Three studies, two parallel group s tudies and one cross- over trial, evaluated fatigue. 4, 5, 190 All found no differences between CBM and placebo. One study used the LSEQ and found significantly greater tiredness in the CBM group compared to placebo for the lowest dose of smoked THC evalua ted (2.5%) but no difference between groups at higher doses, with a suggestion of a grea ter tiredness in placebo groups at the highest dose (9%). Two studies, one cross-over and one parallel group, evaluated quantity of sleep.

One was a very small parallel group study judged to be at high risk of b ias. This study reported a significant beneficial effect of nabilone on the sleep apnoea/h ypopnea index but this should be interpreted with some caution due to the methodolog ical limitations associated with this study. 72 The other study in patients with sleep disorders was a cross-over trial in patients Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 134 with fibromyalgia and compared nabilone with amitri ptyline. 133 This suggested some beneficial effects of nabilone on insomnia but grea ter sleep restfulness with amitriptyline. Nineteen studies included for other populations (ch ronic pain and MS) also evaluated sleep as an outcome. Overall there was some evidence tha t CBM may improve sleep in these patient groups (Table 37). There were sufficient d ata to pool results for sleep quality and sleep disturbance, both suggested significant benef icial effects in favour of cannabis. There was evidence of small study effect based on sleep q uality (p=0.012), the only outcome for which sufficient data were available to allow inves tigation of this.

However, it did report p-values for the Mann-Whitne y/Wilcoxon test comparing change from baseline between group.

One study was rated as at serious risk of bias overall, because exposure status was determined by urine toxicology screen on entry to the study; whilst this is an objective measure it can only provide data for a ve ry limited time window and may misclassify people with a history of cannabis use. 232 The second study was rated as at critical risk of bias overall, because exposure status deter mined in relation to historical use and was therefore likely to have been susceptible to recall bias. 238 There was no statistical evidence of between study heterogeneity, with both individua l studies and the summary estimate indicating no statistically significant association between regular cannabis use and ischemic stroke/TIA; both studies showed a tend towards more strokes in regular cannabis users (Figure 29).

The remaining study was rated as moderate risk of bias overall, b ecause it was unclear to what time period exposure assessment referred and some potentially i mportant confounders were not adjusted for in determining the effect size. 251 Between study heterogeneity was high and the summary estimate showed no statistically signif icant association between cannabis use (ever vs. never) and lung cancer, after adjusting f or critical confounders (Figure 31).

Eight studies were rated as at criti cal risk of bias overall. 229, 236, 237, 239, 245, 247, 255, 257 For six studies, this rating was applied because e xposure status determined in relation to historical use and was therefore likely to have been susceptible to recall bias; 229, 237, 245, 247, 255, 257 one of these studies also had a substantial amount of missing data on exposure status, 245 another showed a strong association between other illicit drug use during the study and duration of cannabis use (exposure measur e), 247 and a third failed to consider possible confounders in the analysis. 257 Two studies were rated as at critical risk of bias because specified critical confounders were not adj usted for in the analyses, 236, 239 in one of these studies exposure was defined as \"registered c annabis user\" which may have resulted in other users being misclassified. 239 The remaining two studies were rated as serious 249 and moderate 254 risk of bias overall, due to concerns about the me asurement of interventions, 249, 254 and adjustment for confounders. 249 All studies suggested that cannabis use was associa ted with an increased risk of psychosis. The summary estimate based on six studies that comp ared ever use to never use of cannabis showed a strong association between ever u se of cannabis and psychosis (Figure 33).

The remaining study used a case-control design to asses s the relationship between cannabis use and serious suicide attempts. 233 This study was rated as at moderate risk of bias o verall, due to concerns about possible recall bias in the asses sment of exposure and some missing data on exposure. 233 A summary estimate was calculated for the two pros pective cohort studies, which indicated that regular cannabis use has no st atistically significant effect on suicide outcomes (Figure X). However, statistical between s tudy heterogeneity was high and the outcome definitions varied between studies; the stu dy which assessed suicide attempts and suicidal ideation reported data suggesting a signif icant association of these outcomes with regular cannabis use (more than 10 times), OR 2.40 (95% CI: 1.32 to 4.36), after adjusting for critical confounders. 248 the case-control study reported a statistically si gnificant association between cannabis abuse/dependency and serious suici de attempts, after adjusting for Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 164 sociodemographic and childhood factors (OR 3.2 (95% CI: 1.7 to 6.0)); when psychiatric co- morbidities were also adjusted for, the association was no longer statistically significant (OR 2.0, 95% CI: 0.97 to 5.3; Figure 34). 261 FIGURE 34: FOREST PLOT SHOWING RISK OF SUICIDE AMONG REGULAR US ERS OF CBM COMPARED TO NEVER USERS 5.3.2.2 Summary Thirty one observational studies provided data on t he relationship between cannabis use and long-term adverse events (cardiovascular diseas e, respiratory disease, cancer, psychotic disorders, and suicide or suicidal ideation). All studies had methodological limitations; none were judged at low risk of bias overall. Four stud ies were judged at moderate risk of bias, four at serious risk of bias and 23 at critical ris k of bias.

DISCUSSION This systematic review aimed to assess the evidence for the effects and adverse events of medical cannabis. An extensive review of the available literature usi ng 28 databases was conducted in order to identify studies that were relevant to the question of this report. A total of 193 references to 76 RCTs and 31 observational studies were includ ed and presented in this report. 6.1 S UMMARY OF MAIN FINDINGS Two research questions were of interest for this sy stematic review: 1. What are the clinical effects of medical canna bis in people with: nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy; HIV/AIDS (as appetize r); chronic pain; spasticity due (as antidepressant); anxiety disorder; sleep disorder; psychosis; glaucoma (reducing the pressure); or movement disorders due to Tourette's syndrome? 2. What are the adverse events associated with me dical cannabis? For the first objective (clinical effects), primary searches identified 15,786 hits of which 423 were considered potentially relevant and obtained a s full text studies. Depression was the only indication of interest for which no relevant R CTs were identified. Additional focused searches were conducted to identify eligible non-ra ndomised studies for this indication. These searches did not find any potentially relevan t studies even when going to the lowest level of evidence specified as eligible for the rev iew (uncontrolled studies with at least 25 patients). A total of 76 studies available as 1 47 reports were included in the review of effectiveness. The majority of the 76 included studies (6380 parti cipants) evaluated nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy (28 studies), chronic pain (27 studies) and spasticity due to MS and paraplegia (12 studies). All other patient categor ies were evaluated in less than five studies. Thirty-two studies were parallel group studies (4,3 97 participants) and 44 were cross-over trials (1,983). The parallel group trials generall y enrolled greater number of participants than the cross-over trials (median 70, range 13 to 657 in the parallel group trials; median 48, range 6 to 214 in the cross-over trials). Many of the included studies were very old. Date of publication ranged from 1975 to 2014 (median 2004) with one third of trials published before 1990. Studies were conducted in wide range of countries. Twenty-seven studies were funded by the drug manufacturer, 15 were mixed funded between industry and public bodies, 19 were funded by public bodies and 15 did not provided information on source of funding. Only four (5%) trials were judged at low r isk of bias overall, 52 (68%) were judged at high risk of bias, and 20 (26%) at unclear risk of bias. Cannabis was evaluated in a variety of different fo rms. These included oral formulations of cannabidiol oromucosal spray of THC or nabiximols (a combinatio n of THC/CBD). Of the 76 included studies, 53 included a placebo control. A variety of active comparators were included in the trials, with some including both active comparator and placebo. These the second objective (adverse events), searches identified 5085 of which 70 were considered potentially relevant and obtained as ful l text studies. Thirty-one studies available as 46 reports were included. These studie s on long-term adverse events amend the data on short-term AEs reported in the studies included for objective 1 (clinical effects). 6.1.1 Nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy Twenty-eight studies (37 publications; 1,772 partic ipants) evaluated CBM for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in adults and children under going chemotherapy. The studies included patients with a variety of cancers. Some were restricted to single cancer types such as testicular cancer 125 or lung cancer, 101 others included patients with a specific type of cancer such as gastrointestinal 111 or advanced gynaecological cancers, 104 but most included mixed cancers. Seven studies used a parallel group design (467 participants) and 21 (1,305) were cross-over trials. None of the studies were r ated as low risk of bias overall, 23 were judged at high risk of bias and five at unclear ris k of bias. Therefore the results should be interpreted with some caution. Overall there was some evidence that CBM reduces na usea and vomiting and improves appetite and functional status in patients receivin g chemotherapy treatment for various types of cancer. All studies reported beneficial e ffects on all outcomes assessed but these did not reach statistical significance in all studi es and some did report on the statistical significance of their findings. There were only su fficient data to pool results for one outcome, the number of patients showing a complete nausea and vomiting response. This showed a significant beneficial effect of CBM compa red to placebo (OR 3.44, 95% CI 1.45, 8.15). 6.1.2 HIV/AIDS Four studies (255 participants) evaluated CBM as a treatment for appetite stimulation in patients with HIV/AIDS. Three RCTs 84, 88, 129 used a parallel group design (243 participants) and one 130 (12 participants) was a cross-over trial. All stu dies were judged at high risk of bias. There was some evidence that dronabinol is associat ed with an increase in weight compared to placebo. More limited evidence suggested that i t may also be associated with increased appetite, greater % body fat, reduced nausea, and i mproved functional status. However, these outcomes were mostly assessed in single studi es and failed to reach statistical significance. One trial evaluated marijuana and dr onabinol, this study found significantly greater weight gain with both forms of cannabis com pared to placebo. 129 An active comparison study found that megestrol acetate was a ssociated with greater weight gain Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 167 than dronabinol and that combining dronabinol with megestrol acetate did not lead to additional weight gain. 88 6.1.3 Chronic pain Twenty-seven studies (61 publications, 2,439 partic ipants) evaluated CBM as a treatment for chronic pain. The conditions causing the chron ic pain varied between studies and included neuropathic pain (central, peripheral or n ot specified; 11 studies), cancer pain (three studies), diabetic peripheral neuropathy (3 studies), fibromyalgia (2 studies), HIV associated sensory neuropathy (2 studies), refracto ry pain due to MS or other neurological conditions (1 study), rheumatoid arthritis (1 study ), non-cancer pain (1 study), central pain (not specified further; 1 study), musculoskeletal p roblems (1 study) and chemotherapy induced pain (1 study). Fourteen studies were para llel group studies (1980 participants) and fourteen used a cross-over design (459 particip ants). The risk of bias in the included studies was variable. Only two were rated as low r isk of bias for all domains 133, 134 while a further nine were rated as unclear risk of bias. Overall there was some evidence that CBM may improv e pain, there was less evidence for an effect on other outcomes such as quality of life and global impression of change. Studies generally suggested a beneficial effect of CBM on m easures of pain but this did not reach statistical significance in most individual studies . Summary estimates for outcomes where there were sufficient data to permit pooling sugges ted a significant beneficial effect of cannabis on all measures both dichotomous and conti nuous, e.g. 30% reduction in pain (OR 1.35, 95%-CI 0.95 to 1.93; see Table 19 for det ails). Dichotomous data suggested a significant beneficial effect of CBM on patient glo bal impression of change. There was some evidence to support this based on continuous data b ut this was not consistent across trials. Sensitivity analyses that included cross-over trial s in the meta-analyses showed results consistent with those based on parallel group trial s alone. 6.1.4 Spasticity due to multiple sclerosis (MS) or paraplegia Twelve studies (31 reports; 2,213 participants) eva luated CBM as a treatment for spasticity due to MS or paraplegia (Table 21). Ten studies (2 ,188 participants) included patients with MS and two included patients with paraplegia (25 pa rticipants) caused by spinal cord injury. Eight RCTs used a parallel group design (2,091 part icipants) and four (122 participants) were cross-over trials. The risk of bias in the include d studies was variable. Only two, by the same author, were rated as low risk of bias for all domains. 87, 89 A further five were rated as unclear risk of bias. Overall there was some evidence that CBM may improv e spasticity and patient global impression of change, there was less evidence for a n effect on other outcomes such as quality of life, mobility/disability and general di sease specific symptoms. Studies generally suggested a beneficial effect of CBM on measures of spasticity but this failed to reach statistical significance in most studies. The summ ary estimate for the Ashworth scale based on parallel group trials suggested a significant be neficial effect of CBM on spasticity (5 studies: WMD -0.14, 95%-CI -0.27 to -0.01). For ot her measures of spasticity also suggested Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 168 a beneficial effect but did not reach statistical s ignificance (Table 25). Dichotomous data suggested a significant beneficial effect of CBM on patient global impression of change, this was supported by a further cross-over trial that pr ovided continuous data for this outcome. There were no clear differences between the differe nt types of CBM evaluated in these studies. Sensitivity analyses that included cross- over trials in the meta-analyses showed results consistent with those based on parallel gro up trials alone. 6.1.5 Depression No studies evaluating cannabis for the treatment of depression fulfilled inclusion criteria for the review. Additional searches were carried out f or this population with lower levels of evidence eligible for inclusion. These searches di d not locate any eligible studies. Five studies included for other sections of this re view reported on depression as an outcome measures. 3, 86, 139, 141, 144 Four of these studies evaluated patients with chr onic pain 86, 139, 141, 144 and one was conducted in patients with MS. 3 Three studies 3, 86, 144 were parallel group trials and two were cross-over trials. 139, 141 Two studies 86, 144 were rated as unclear risk of bias while the remaining three were rated as high r isk of bias. There was no data available on the CBM for the trea tment of depression. Studies included for other sections of the review that reported on d epression as an outcome found little evidence of an effect of CBM on depression. 6.1.6 Anxiety One parallel group trial evaluated patients with an xiety disorder. 95 This study was conducted in 24 patients with generalised social an xiety disorder in Brazil. Participants were randomised to receive either cannabidiol or placebo before taking part in a simulated public speaking test. The study was judged at high risk o f bias. The study a significant beneficial effect of cannab idiol compared to placebo on change from before to during a simulated public speaking test o n the anxiety factor of a visual analogue mood scale (MD change from baseline -16.52, p-value 0.012). Additional data on anxiety outcomes provided by three studies (two cross-over and one parallel group) in patients with chronic pain also suggested a beneficial effect of CBM but these studies were not restricted to patients with anxiety disorders. 6.1.7 Sleep disorder Two studies evaluated patients with sleep disorders . 72, 133 One study enrolled patients with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome 72 and one included patients with fibromyalgia. 133 One study was judged at low risk of bias 133 the other at high risk of bias. 72 Only two studies evaluated CBM in patients with sle ep disorders. One study reported a significant beneficial effect of nabilone on the sl eep apnoea/hypopnea index (MD change from baseline -19.64, p-value 0.018) but this shoul d be interpreted with some caution due to the methodological limitations associated with t his study. 72 The other study in patients with sleep disorders was a cross-over trial in pati ents with fibromyalgia and compared nabilone with amitriptyline. 133 This suggested some beneficial effects of nabilon e on Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 169 insomnia (MD change from baseline -3.25, 95%-CI -5. 26 to -1.24) but greater sleep restfulness (MD change from baseline 0.48, 95%-CI 0 .01 to 0.95) with amitriptyline. Nineteen studies included for other populations (ch ronic pain and MS) also evaluated sleep as an outcome. Overall there was some evidence tha t CBM may improve sleep in these patient groups (Table 37). There were sufficient d ata to pool results for sleep quality (WMD -0.58, 95% CI -0.87 to 95% CI -0.52 to 0.00), both suggested significant beneficial effect s in favour of cannabis. 6.1.8 Psychosis Two studies (9 reports, 71 participants) evaluated CBM as a treatment for psychosis. 75, 216-223 Both studies were conducted in Germany by the same group. One was a parallel group study (42 participants) 216 and the other used a cross-over design (29 partici pants). 75 Information on the cross-over trial was available o nly as conference abstracts. The two studies enrolled patient with DSM-IV criteria of ac ute paranoid schizophrenia or schizophreniform psychosis and 36 in the BPRS tota l score. Both trials evaluated cannabidol (max dose 600-800mg/day), the parallel g roup study compared this to the active comparator Amisulpride 216 and the cross-over trial included a placebo contro l phase. 75 . The two studies were both rated as high risk of bias. There was very little data available on the treatme nt of psychosis with CBM. Two trials, a parallel group trial comparing cannabidiol to amisu lpride and a cross-over trial comparing cannabidiol to placebo found no difference in outco mes between treatment groups (Mental health rated by Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and mood using PANSS). 6.1.9 Glaucoma One cross-over trial (6 participants) evaluated CBM for the treatment of glaucoma. 224 It included patients with ocular hypertension or early open angle glaucoma, with a mild visual defect in at least one eye. The study compared THC (5mg), cannabidiol (20mg), cannabidiol (40mg) and placebo all in the form of an oromucosal spray and was judged at unclear risk of bias. Only one very small cross-over trial was evalauted CBM for the treatment of glaucoma. This study found no evidence of an effect of CBM on intr aocular pressure Movement disorders due to Tourette syndrome Two studies (four publications, 36 participants) ev aluated CBM for the treatment of movement disorders due to Tourette syndrome.225-228 Both studies were conducted in Germany by the same group. One was a parallel grou p trial (24 participants) 225 and the other used a cross-over design (12 participants). 227 Both trials compared THC capsules (maximum dose 10mg/day) to placebo. The parallel g roup study was judged at high risk of bias 225 and the cross-over trial at unclear risk of bias ( Table 48). 227 Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 170 Two small studies, one parallel group and one cross -over trial, suggested that THC capsules may be associated with a significant improvement in tic severity, e.g. MD change from baseline, TSSL-global score -9.08, 95%-CI -12.87 to -5.29. 225 6.1.11 Adverse events Sixty-two of the 76 studies included in the clinica l effectiveness review provided data on short term adverse events. We found no evidence fo r a difference in the effect of cannabis on adverse events based on study design, population , comparator, method of cannabis administration or duration of follow-up, and so ana lyses were conducted for all studies combined. CBM was associated with a significantly greater risk of any AE, serious AE, withdrawals due to AE, ear and labyrinth disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, general disorders and administration site conditions, metab olism and nutrition disorders, psychiatric disorders, renal and urinary disorders, asthenia, b alance problems, confusion, diarrhoea, disorientation, drowsiness, dry mouth, euphoria, fa tigue, hallucination, nausea, somnolence, and vomiting. Other AEs did not show s ignificant differences between groups. We included an additional 31 observational studies (46 reports) to investigate the effects of cannabis on long term adverse events (cardiovascula r disease, respiratory disease, cancer, psychotic disorders, and suicide or suicidal ideati on). All studies examined the relationship between recreational use of cannabis and the outcom es of interest; we did not find any studies that specifically assessed medical cannabis use and long term AEs. All studies had methodological weaknesses with none rated as low ri sk of bias and only four as moderate risk of bias. 6.2 C OMPARISON WITH OTHER REVIEWS A number of systematic reviews assessed the use of medical cannabis in populations relevant to and discussed in this report. Appendix 10 presents a brief overview of these reviews. In contrast to this report most of the ot her systematic reviews are based solely on observational studies and only a small number (n=4) addressed more than one relevant population. It appears as if this report offers th e most comprehensive review of the literature on the use of medical cannabis in the pr e-specified populations relevant to this report. 6.3 S TRENGTHS , LIMITATIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES This review sought wherever possible to reduce the risk of bias during the review processes and analyses. One of the main strengths of the revi ew is the adherence to the most rigorous methods for systematic reviews. In order to try and identify all of the potentially relevant evidence relating to the review question and reduce the risk of publication bias, a n extensive range of resources were searched including electronic databases, guidelines and systematic reviews. Both published and unpublished trials were eligible for inclusion. There were no date or language restrictions. An extensive review of the available literature using 28 databases was conducted in order to identify studies that are rel evant to the question of this report. Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 171 Search methods followed best practice standards in systematic reviews.56, 57 Titles and abstracts identified through electronic database an d web searching were independently screened by two reviewers. In order to minimise bi as and errors, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were performed independently by two reviewers. A further strength of the review is that different approaches were combined: Results of direct comparisons of relevant treatment s were presented and supplemented by narrative discussions of the study characteristics. Results of quantitative analysis and meta-analysis were also presented following the guidance by the GRADE Working Group. 67-69 However, despite all efforts to ensure the risk of bias and error was minimised, the findings of the review may still be subject to limitations a nd uncertainties. Many of these were beyond our control and many related to the quality and quantity of the available evidence base. One primary limitation is the quality of the primar y studies included in the review. We carried out a detailed risk of bias assessment of b oth the included trials and observational studies. We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess the included RCTs and the new ACROBAT-NRS tool for the observational studies incl uded for long-term adverse events. Both are domain-based tools which provided an asses sment of the risk of bias (internal validity) of the included studies. Using the Cochra ne risk of bias tool, only four (5%) trials included for the assessment of clinical effects wer e judged at low risk of bias overall, 52 (68%) were judged at high risk of bias, and 20 (26% ) at unclear risk of bias. The major potential source of bias in the trials was incomple te outcome data. Over 50% of trials reported relatively large numbers of withdrawals an d did not adequately account for this in the analysis by using an appropriate intention to t reat (ITT) analysis based on all randomised participants. Based on the new ACROBAT-NRS tool, n one of the included observational studies were judged as low risk of bias and only fo ur were judged at moderate risk of bias; most were judged at critical risk of bias. The mai n limitation in these studies related to how cannabis exposure was measured. There were a number of issues which made the data a nalysis complex. The included studies used a large variety of measures to evaluate outcom es, and even very similar outcomes were often assessed using a variety of different me asures. For instance when assessing chronic pain a number of different instruments have been used (see Table 18). Furthermore, a wide range of timepoints were report ed in the included trials, limiting the applicability of the findings of these studies. Th e majority of the studies were two arm trials with a placebo control arm, however, some studies i ncluded active comparisons and multiple arms comparing more than one form of CBM, different doses of CBM, or active and placebo comparator arms. This necessitated selecti ng a single result from each trial to contribute to meta-analyses to avoid double countin g of studies. Where possible, we selected the result most similar for the treatment or dose most similar to the other studies Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 172 contributing to that meta-analysis and for placebo controlled comparisons rather than active comparisons. For the short term AE analysis we selected the highest reported CBM dose as we hypothesised that this would be most lik ely to be associated with AEs and so this analysis would present a \"worst case\" scenario. St udies evaluated various different forms of cannabis administered via various different routes (oral capsules, smoked, vapourised, oromucosal spray, intramuscular injection) and acti ve comparators differed across trials. This combined with the variety of outcome measures and the broad population groupings considered by this review resulted in a very hetero geneous set of included studies which meant that meta-analysis was not always possible or appropriate. Even where meta- analysis may have been appropriate, studies often f ailed to report the required information (i.e. measure of effect and estimate of variation s uch as mean and standard deviation for each treatment group) to permit pooling. Such stud ies often only reported p-values for differences between groups, sometimes without even reporting on the method of analysis performed, this made it very difficult to interpret and synthesise results from these trials. A further difficulty with the continuous data were th at, even for the same outcomes, some studies reported results as difference between grou ps at follow-up and others reported results for differences in change from baseline. A s advised by Cochrane, we combined both types of data when estimating summary mean differen ces. 56 A potential problem with RCTs using cross-over desi gns is the possible unblinding due to strong treatment or side effects. Therefore, we pr esented the results of parallel group as the prime outcome alongside the findings of cross-o ver RCTs in the same populations as sensitivity analysis. 6.4 R ECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH Further large, robust, randomised controlled trials are needed. These trials need to adhere to CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Tri als) 262 , reporting standards and report outcome data in a form that can be incorporated int o meta-analyses. Although it can be challenging to conduct randomised trials well, e.g. due to slow recruitment of participants, paucity of funding or ethical considerations, this report identified 76 completed and 46 ongoing RCTs (see Appendix 2) as well as 31 observa tional studies relevant for long-term adverse events. This indicates that it is possible to plan and perform those trials. Systematic reviews including meta-analyses of results from ran domised controlled trials are widely accepted as the highest level of evidence and hence the 'gold standard' for making treatment and reimbursement decisions. Future studies need to assess relevant outcomes (in cluding disease-specific endpoints, quality of life, and adverse events) using standard ised outcome measures at similar time points to ensure inclusion in future meta-analyses. All ongoing or future trials should be registered, e.g. on clinicaltrials.gov, to make them known to the scientific community, to allow plannin g of research efforts, and to avoid duplication of work. Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 173 Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 174 7. CONCLUSIONS Based on an extensive and rigorous systematic revie w of the literature of clinical effects and side effects of medical cannabis in ten populations which identified a total of 193 references to 76 RCTs and 31 observational studies, use of med ical cannabis might be warranted for some medical conditions. Medical cannabis showed statistically significant b eneficial effects for the treatment of nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy, chronic pa in, on spasticity due multiple sclerosis (MS) or paraplegia, anxiety, sleep disorders, and m ovement disorders due to Tourette syndrome. However, these results should be taken w ith some caution due to a very heterogeneous set of included studies which also su ffered from some potential risk of bias. However, short-term side effects are relatively com mon and include serious adverse events. Furthermore, long-term cannabis use is linked to ps ychosis. However, no other association with long-term adverse events was found. Again, the se findings might be restricted by methodological limitations of the identified studie s on short- and long-term adverse events. Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 175 8.

The questionnaire includes questions on the following symptoms 1. Apparent sadness 2. Reported sadness 3. Inner tension 4. Reduced sleep 5. Reduced appetite 6. Concentration difficulties 7. Lassitude 8. Inability to feel 9. Pessimistic thoughts 10. Suicidal thoughts A self-rating version of this scale (MADRS-S) is often used in clinical practice and correlates reasonably well with expert ratings. The MADRS-S instrument has nine questions, with an overall score ranging from 0 to 54 points. Cut-off points: 0-6: Normal, symptom absent, 7-19 Mild Depression, 20-34 Moderate Depression, >34 Severe depression.

General disease specific symptoms Tourettes syndrome clinical global impression scale (TS-CGI) See Cath 2011. 327 Tourettes Syndrome - Clinical Global Impressions Scale (TS-CGI-S) The CGI-S assesses change in global daily functioning. The CGI-S has shown good face validity and is extremely easy to use, although inter-rater reliability is somewhat low. A 7-point scale (0-6) is used.; (between 0 = much deteriorated and, via 3 = no change, to 6 = very much improved). Lower scores indicate worse outcomes. Favours CBM (Higher scores indicate better outcomes) General disease specific symptoms 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28) See van der Heijde 1990. 328 The DAS28 is a measure of disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). DAS stands for 'disease activity score' and the number 28 refers to the 28 joints that are examined in this assessment. The DAS28 is a composite score derived from 4 of the following measures: Joint swelling and tenderness, global scores of pain and overall status, blood markers of inflammation (e.g. ESR and CRP), questionnaires assessing function and X-rays/ultrasound/MRI. A composite score derived from the following: Number of swollen joints (out of 28), Number of tender joints (out of 28), blood measurements of ESR or CRP, and a \"global assessment of health\" by the patient on a 10cm line. A \"complex mathematical formula\" produces the overall DAS score. A DAS28 of >5.1 implies active disease, <3.2 = low disease activity and <2.6 = remission. Higher scores indicate worse outcomes.

This is done by creating Z-scores for each component of the MSFC: the MSFC score represents he MSFC represents the average change in the three tests. MSFC Score={ (Average (1/9-HPT) - Baseline Mean (1/9-HPT) / Baseline Std Dev (1/9-HPT) + { - (Average 25-Foot Walk - Mean 25-Foot Walk) /Baseline Dev PASAT-3} / 3.0 A minus Z- score indicates a better outcome Favours CBM (higher scores on the BRB indicate better outcomes) Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 617 Category Outcome Description Scale Treat-ment arm favoured by positive mean difference (MD) scores of two 25-Foot Timed Walk trials; (3) the number correct from the PASAT-3 (Paced-Auditory Serial Addition Test). Global impression General Health Questionnaire 12 See Sanchez-Lopez 2008. 331 GHQ-12 - a measure of current mental health. The questionnaire was originally developed as a 60-item instrument but at present a range of shortened versions of the questionnaire including the GHQ-30, the GHQ-28, the GHQ-20, and the GHQ-12 is available. The scale asks whether the respondent has experienced a particular symptom or behaviour recently. Each item is rated on a four-point scale (less than usual, no more than usual, rather more than usual, or much more than usual); and for example when using the GHQ-12 it gives a total score of 36 or 12 based on the selected scoring methods. The 12-Item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) (Goldberg & Williams, 1988) consists of 12 items, each one assessing the severity of a mental problem over the past few weeks using a 4-point Likert-type scale (from 0 to 3). The score was used to generate a total score ranging from 0 to 36. The positive items were corrected from 0 (always) to 3 (never) and the negative ones from 3 (always) to 0 (never). High scores indicate worse health. Favours control (lower scores indicate better health/outcomes) Global impression Karnofsky performance status See Karnofsky 1949. 131 Performance status is an attempt to quantify cancer patients' general well-being and activities of daily life. This measure is used to determine whether they can receive chemotherapy, whether dose adjustment is necessary, and as a measure for the required intensity of palliative care. The Karnofsky score runs from 100 to 0, where 100 is \"perfect\" health\" and 0 is death. Lower scores indicate worse outcomes.

This is the UK neurological disability SCALE also formerly known as \"Guys Neurological Disability Scale (UKNDS/GNDS)\" The Guy's Neurological Disability Scale (GNDS) was devised as a simple and user-friendly clinical disability scale capable of embracing the whole range of disabilities which could be encountered in the course of multiple sclerosis. It has 12 separate categories which include cognition, mood, vision, speech, swallowing, upper limb function, lower limb function, bladder function, bowel function, sexual function, fatigue, and `others'. A multiple sclerosis (MS) specific measure. Patient-based questionnaire composed of twelve subsections including mobility, scored 0-5 based on use of aids. Walking is considered 'not affected' or affected but independent (no assistance) for scores of 0 and 1, respectively, while scores 2-5 represent increasing degrees of support (aids, person, wheelchair). 5= restricted to wheelchair.

However, as other disabling neurological conditions affect a person's ability to walk, it was adapted to become a generic measure of walking and mobility and renamed the Walk-12. The Walk-12 contains twelve items describing the impact of MS on walking which were generated from 30 MS patient interviews, expert opinion, and literature review. Any reference to MS was removed to produce a generic tool. 12 questions on a 5-point scale (1-5). Questions test limitations on mobility 1= Never, 5= Extremely. Gives a total score out of 60.

To account for differences in baseline pain intensity among patients in the study, pain intensity category and VAS scores are converted into \"pain intensity difference (PID) scores by subtracting them from the pain score taken at baseline. Positive scores indicate reduction in pain, making the PID scores analogous to pain relief scores. (An alternative method is to use analysis of covariance). PID or relief scores are commonly summed over the observation period, weighted for the time between observations, and the summed scores respectively termed SPID (summed pain intensity difference) or TOTPAR (total pain relief).

Nine of these provide a total of ten 0-10 NRS responses and there is a multi-part free text question. The NPS score to be used for the analysis was the sum of the ten 0-10 NRS responses. If up to three individual items were missing, then an NPS score was imputed by multiplying the mean of the completed items by 10. If more than three individual items were missing, then the whole score was missing.

Sleep Sleep disturbance score (QoL) See Yu 2011. 370 This refers to the PROMIS (Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) Sleep Disturbance instrument There are two main types. The short form and the Computerised Adaptive Test (CAT) using algorithms to adapt the test to the patient's responses. Items are scaled on a 5 point scale 1-5 from \"not at all\" to \"very much\" and are scaled accordingly to positive or negative statements. E.g. \"My sleep was restless\" would carry 1 for \"not at all\" and 5 for \"very much\" whereas \"I got enough sleep\" would score 5 for \"Never\" and 1 for \"Always\". Higher scores indicate more negative outcomes. Favours control (lower scores indicate better outcomes) Sleep Sleep Quality BS-11 See Jensen 1989. 349 The sleep quality BS-11 score is also termed the \"11-point box scale\" and is linked to a wider pain questionnaire (already detailed earlier in the table).

Lines extend between extremes like \"more difficult than usual\" and \"easier than usual\". Responses are measured using a 100-mm scale and are then averaged to provide a score for each domain. Higher scores indicate improved sleep parameters. Sleep AHI (apnea hypopnea index) See Manser 2001. 373 The apnea- hypopnea index or apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) is an index of sleep apnea severity that combines apneas and hypopneas. The apneas (pauses in breathing) must last for at least 10 seconds and are associated with a decrease in blood oxygenation. Combining these gives an overall sleep apnea severity score that evaluates both number of sleep disruptions and degree of oxygen desaturation (low blood level). An average score that represents the combined numbers of apnoeas and hypopnoeas that occur per hour of sleep. In general, the AHI can be used to classify the severity of disease (mild 5-15, moderate 15-30, and severe greater than 30).

Wang (2008 )54 AE: Medical cannabinoids October 2007 RCTs (n=23); Observational studies (n=8) Short -term use of existing medical cannabinoids appeared to increase the risk of non-serious adverse events. The risks associat ed with long- term use were poorly characterized in published clini cal trials and observational studies. High-quality trials of long-term exposure are required to further characterize safety issues related to the use of medical cannabinoids.

Van den Elsen (2014 )394 N&V: Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting October 2013 RCTs (n=5) The studies showed no efficacy on dyski nesia, breathlessness and chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting. Two studies showed that THC might be useful in treatment of anorexia an d behavioral symptoms in dementia. Adverse events were more common during cannabinoid treatment compared to the control treat ment, and were most frequently sedation like symptoms. Although trial s studying medical cannabinoids included older subjects, there i s a lack of evidence of its use specifically in older patients. Ad equately powered trials are needed to assess the efficacy and safety of ca nnabinoids in older subjects, as the potential symptomatic benefit is especially attractive in this age group. Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research ((2004)32 Pain NR Observational studies(n=2) NR Burns (2006)395 Pain August 2005 Cannabinoids provide a potential approach to pain management with a novel therapeutic target and mech anism. Chronic pain often requires a polypharmaceutical ap proach to management, and cannabinoids are a potential additi on to the arsenal of treatment options.

Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 639 Author (year) Population Date of searches Number of studies Review conclusions Campbell, F.A.T., M. R. Carroll, D. Reynolds, D. J(2001)38 Pain October 1999 RCTs (n=9) Cannabinoids are no more effective than codeine in c ontrolling pain and have depressant effects on the central nervous syste m that limit their use. Their widespread introduction into clinica l practice for pain management is therefore undesirable. In acute postope rative pain they should not be used. Before cannabinoids can be c onsidered for treating spasticity and neuropathic pain, further va lid randomised controlled studies are needed. Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Heal(2010) 35 Pain June 2010 RCTs (n=3); Observational studies (n=1) In conclusion, the four identified studies suggest that the use of cannabinoids as co-analgesia in patients with non-neu ropathic pain is effective. The patient populations included in the s tudies varied and included patients with cancer pain, non-cancer pain, rheumatoid arthritis, and acute postherpetic neuralgia. The studi es also varied with type of cannabinoid used, the agents used for co -analgesia, and the outcome measurements. Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Heal(2010) 36 Pain June 2010 RCTs (n=7) Overall, the limited evidence suggests that cannabinoi ds may provide pain relief in patients with HIV or MS who have neur opathic pain when used as add on therapy. It is not clear if this be nefit would be maintained longer-term. No benefit was observed in di abetic neuropathy and pain relief with nabilone was inferi or to a narcotic analgesic. These points may be considered when making formulary decisions about the use of cannabinoids in neuropathic pain.

Lynch (2011 )40 Pain October 2010 RCTs (n=15) In conclusion this systematic review of 18 recent good quality randomized trials demonstrates that cannabinoids are a modestly effective and safe treatment option for chronic non- cancer (predominantly neuropathic) pain. Given the prevale nce of chronic pain, its impact on function and the paucity of effe ctive therapeutic interventions, additional treatment options are urgen tly needed. More large scale trials of longer duration reporting on pain and level of function are required. Mart\u00edn -S\u00e1nchez (2009 )402 Pain February 2008 RCTs (n=18) Currently available evidence suggests that cannabis tr eatment is moderately efficacious for treatment of chronic pain , but beneficial effects may be partially (or completely) offset by potentially serious harms. More evidence from larger, well-designed trial s is needed to clarify the true balance of benefits to harm.

Richards (2012 )405 Pain November 2010 RCTs (n= 4) There is currently weak evidence that oral nefopam, topical capsaicin and oromucosal cannabis are all superior to placebo in reducing pain in patients with RA. However, each agent is associate d with a significant side effect profile. The confidence in ou r estimates is not strong given the difficulties with blinding, the smal l numbers of participants evaluated and the lack of adverse event data. In some patients, however, even a small degree of pain relie f may be considered worthwhile. Until further research is avail able, given the relatively mild nature of the adverse events, capsaici n could be considered as an add-on therapy for patients with persi stent local pain and inadequate response or intolerance to other treatments. Oral nefopam and oromucosal cannabis have more signifi cant side effect profiles however and the potential harms seem to outweigh any modest benefit achieved. Snedecor (2014 )406 Pain June 2011 RCTs (n=58) Selecting an appropriate pDPN therapy is key given t he large number of available treatments. Comparative results revealed relative equivalence among many of the studied interventions having the largest overall sample sizes and highlight the importa nce of standardization of methods to effectively assess pain. Rathbone (2008 )55 Psychosis: Schizophrenia April 2007 RCTs (n=1) At present, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of cannabis/cannabinoid compounds for people sufferin g with schizophrenia.

Schoeler (2013 )407 Psychosis: Psychotic disorder NR RCTs (n=66) The present results suggest that memory as global constr uct appears to be impaired in healthy users without the diagnosis o f a psychotic disorder but not in those suffering from the illness. Latter users seem to perform better in certain domains such as long-te rm memory and working memory, indicating that individual characte ristics related to psychopathology are likely to explain the distinct ou tcome between the two cannabis using groups. Zammit (2008 )408 Psychosis: Psychotic disorder November 2006 Observational studies (n=13) Confidence that most associations reported were specifi cally due to cannabis is low. Despite clinical opinion, it remains i mportant to establish whether cannabis is harmful, what outcomes are particularly susceptible, and how such effects are medi ated. Studies to examine this further are eminently feasible.
