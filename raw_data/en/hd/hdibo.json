A well written resume can be a window of opportunity for an interview, as it is typically the first glance an employer has of your qualifications. Resumes should be in reverse chronological order, jobs and experiences organized with the most recent first. What should be included?Quick Tips A resume should be 1-2 pages. If you commit to a second page, the second page should be nearly full. Choose an easy to read, professional font between 10.5-12 size. Use plain and consistent formatting without color. Use Microsoft Word. Do not use Google Docs, Canva, InDesign or any other graphics. Do not include references or \"references available upon request\" in your resume . These will be formally requested later. Include your undergraduate and/or graduate GPA if above 3.5. Utilize strong action verbs to begin your bullet points. Try not to repeat verbs. Be consistent. Maintain the same styles and formatting throughout your document. Email as a PDF whenever you can. No edits or formatting discrepancies will be seen this way. Writing Better Bullet Points In order to effectively describe your experiences through bullet point descriptions, use strong action verbs, be succinct, provide specific examples, quantify accomplishments, and include industry specific buzzwords whenever possible. Need some support? Utilize the PAR method: P: Describe the project or task. A: What activity did you do? R: What were the tangible and quantifiable results?Helped file city files on residents Reviewed documents with supervisors Independently organized 500+ files on 10 years of resident claim reports Reviewed information document requests with local internal auditors Compiled report, including infographics, presented to department leadershipCity of New Orleans Intern Versus City of New Orleans, Office of Emergency Preparedness Data Intern, May 2020 - August 2020ExampleAction Verbs Development Adapted Developed Effected Formulated Gathered Planned Reorganized Translated Ingenuity Conceived Constructed Created Defined Designed Determined Devised Established Formed Founded Generated Initiated Invented Originated Predicted Produced Proposed Writing Skills Drafted Integrated Summarized Wrote Research Skills Analyzed Asses Calculated Clarified Collected Compared Compiled Conducted Detected Determined Diagnosed Evaluated Examined Experimented Explored Extracted Formulated Gathered Identified Inspected Interpreted Interviewed Investigated Located Measured Organized Researched Searched Solved Summarized Surveyed Systematized Tested Verified Administrative Administered Controlled Contributed Coordinated Facilitated Instructed Managed Moderated Prepared Present Provided Recruited Scheduled Supervised Trained Utilized Follow-through Allocated Completed Disseminated Enforced Executed Expedited Implemented Installed Instituted Maintained Performed Reported Improvement Achieved Demonstrated Enlarged Expanded Increased Strengthened Editing Converted Edited Improved Recommended Revised Organization Arranged Catalogued Conduct Delegated Orchestrate Organized Sorted Interpersonal Skills Advised Advocated Arbitrated Communicated Consulted Contracted Counseled Interviewed Negotiated Observed Conflict Resolution Approved Resolved Settled Solved Leadership Appointed Authorized Chaired Contracted Controlled Coordinated Decided Delegated Developed Directed Emphasized Enforced Enhanced Established Generated Guided Handled Hired Improved Incorporated Initiated Led Managed Mobilized Motivated Oversaw Planned Presided Prioritized Recommended StrengthenedName (Should be at the top of the document and your largest font) Tulane or Personal email address and cell phone number Address (Include address if you are applying in the same city) University and Location Degree, Date Concentration Title of Dissertation, Thesis Research Interests Use different categories including Teaching Experience, Research Experience, Contract Experience, Public Health Experience Name of organization, location, job title, dates Use strong action verbs for each bullet point Describe the context of the situation and talk about the skills you developed along with tasks completed Full list of publications and presentations in APA formatting List all memberships and/or leadership roles in professional organizations Cite any additional service outside of work duties including committee membership or board member work Computer, technical, language skills. Do not list soft skills.Contact Information Education Experience Publications and Presentations Memberships Service SkillsCurriculum Vitae (CV) A curriculum vitae (CV) is different than a resume in that it highlights education and experiences but is typically more focused on academic work including teaching and research. The purpose of a CV is to display your full history of academic work and is usually more appropriate for doctoral students or students applying to teaching and research roles. What's the purpose? CV Resume Who do you send to? LengthContent ReferencesFellow Academics, Faculty Multiple pages, Not RestrictedAcademic/ Scholarly Achievements Experience, and Education Can be IncludedEmployers 1-2 Full PagesExperience, Education, Skills Not IncludedWhat should be included? How is a CV different from a Resume?Cover Letters References What's the purpose? What should be included?A cover letter is an introduction to both you and your resume that highlights only your most relevant work. Write a new cover letter specific to each position, and try not to repeat the same content in your resume. A cover letter is also an example of your writing, so it should be proofread. Outline the position and company you are applying to. Mention who, if anyone, referred you to the position. Talk about your most relevant experiences, skills, and qualifications. Highlight two or three direct examples of your experience that connect to the position you are applying to. Can be a continuation of paragraph 2 if more space is needed. Thank the employer for their time, and state that you look forward to speaking with them. Sign off (Sincerely,) and include your full name.Paragraph 1: Introduce Interest Paragraph 2 and 3: Why are you a good fit? Paragraph 3: Reiterate Interest, Thank You, Next StepsDo your research on the company you are applying to before writing your cover letter. Write your cover letter in the active voice. Use the same font and overall formatting of your resume. Address to a specific person. Try to find a hiring manager or HR contact on the employer website. Follow job position instructions on how to send your letter. Always send as a PDF. Cover letters should be one page or less. Focus on relevant technical skills to the position rather than your soft skills.Quick Tips References typically should not be included in a resume or cover letter. These will be asked for either in your electronic application or after you have interviewed in person. Employers may ask your references for a more formal recommendation letter or they may follow up with questions over phone/ email. Quick Tips Try to identify 3-4 people to serve as your references before your job search. Examples can include past supervisors, faculty, or staff. Ask references for their permission before giving their information to an employer. Keep in touch with your references as your search continues and evolves. Choose only the people with whom you have had good interactions with. You do not necessarily have to include your current or most recent supervisor. Avoid personal references (family, friend, neighbor, etc.) Employers may request a formal recommendation letter or they may call or email your references, so be sure to provide accurate and up to date contact information. Do not include references in your resume or cover letter documents unless instructed to do so.BSPH Resume Sample JANE G.

I learned about this opportunity through my research of Louisiana initiatives on health marketing and communications . My strong critical thinking and leadership skills would allow me to support the LDHH's goal of protecting and promoting the health of the communities in Louisiana. My coursework at Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, community service experience, and involvement in student activities concerning public health have helped me to develop a fundamental understanding of key issues and the administrative skills necessary to contribute to this position. The accomplishment of which I am most proud of is my involvement in Global Public Healt h Brigades. Within this Tulane chapter of this organization, I participated in a nine-day trip to Honduras. This experience into healthcare delivery with a strong famili al-based community allowed me to develop my communication skills through various channels. My specific focus in epidemiology and the social and behavioral aspects of public health allowed me to develop an understanding of the distribution of diseases and the social processes that influence health statuses and interventions. Consequently, while in Honduras, I was able to effectively work with individual families, local schools, and community leaders in order to develop sustainable health solutions and establish a standard of health quality by emphasizing prevention and education. Additionally, my participation in the Global Public Health Brigades demonstrates my organizational and leadership skills, as well as my ability to work collaboratively with various parties. I look forward to speaking with you to discuss my qualifications and the possibility of an intervi ew. Thank you very much. Sincerely, Trudy Tulane Cover Letter Sample 2 JANE G.

Box 1 Sefwi Bekwai, Western Region Humjibre, Ghana Dear Mr. Jones : I am writing to express my interest in your Malaria Prevention Volunteer position which was promoted by Dr. Gleckler at Tulane Univers ity. I am currently obtaining my Bachelor of Science in Public Health at Tulane University School of Publ ic Health and Tropical Medicine and will graduate in May 20 22. My varied coursework has expanded my knowledge of the social concepts , determinants, and processes that influence health statuses and public h ealth interventions. The most significant of these was the Social and Behavioral Aspects of Public Health course. Through this course, I have: Gained an understanding of how race, ethnicity, gender, and poverty form a basis for literacy in the social and behavioral aspects of public health. Develop ed the capability to provide insight with the populations I come across and develop an effective narrative for communicating psychosocial issues in public health. Convert ed theory into practice through community -based projects and research. Additionally, my experiences and involvement in extracurricular activities have allowed me to develop skills in leadership, project management, and communication. For example, as the Chairperson for the Community Action Council of Tulane University Students, I am tasked with ensuring that the student body is presented with community service and volunteer opportunities in the Greater New Orleans area. In addition, as the Social Committee Chairperson of Sigma Delta Tau Sorority, I have planned and organized four events each attended by over 200 people.

I believe my experience, qualities and skills, and passion demonstrate my ability to be a strong asset to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation as a Maternal, Neonatal, and Child Health Program Officer. During a transitional year towards efforts focused around the global COVID- 19 pandemic, I appreciate the opportunity to be flexible in providing the necessary skills to care for all, while impacting those in the maternal, neonatal, and children's programs as well. My commitment to maternal and child health began with my experience as an undergraduate, when I was selected as a White House Health Policy Intern under the Obama Administration and became well - versed in the issues confronting the healthcare delivery system as well as the ways that politics and policy intersect. In my more recent internship at John Snow, Inc., I was an integral part of a team tasked with researching and developing a cost- effective proposal for the distribution of contraceptives to low- income females in rural communities in Southeast Asia. The proposal is currently being used in advocacy efforts and has made a strong impact on stakeholders and elected officials in Southeast Asia. I am convinced that my leadership and analytical skills and my familiarity with critical health issues make me an excellent candidate for this position, and I am confident that the culture of the organization is a good match for my personality, talents, and career goals.
