This study aimedto systematically review herbs and herb-derived compoundsor herbal formulations that have been investigated for theiranti-cholangiocarcinoma potential. Systematic literaturesearches were conducted in three electronic databases: PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus. One hundred and twenty-three research articles fulfilled the eligibility criteraand were included in the analysis (68 herbs, isolated com-pounds and/or synthetic analogs, 9 herbal formulations, and119 compounds that are commonly found in several plantspecies). The most investigated herbs were Atractylodes lancea DC.

Cucurbitacin B and triptolide are herbal isolated compounds that exhibit the most promisingactivities (IC 50< 1 \u00b5M). A series of experimental studies ( in vi- tro, in vivo , and humans) confirmed the anti-cholangiocarci- noma potential and safety profile of A. lancea (Thunb.) DC. (Compositae) and its active compounds atractylodin and - eudesmol, including the capsule pharmaceutical of the stan-dardized A. lancea (Thunb.) DC. (Composit ae) extract. Future research should be focused on the full development of thecandidate herbs to deliver products that are safe and effectivefor cholangiocarcinoma control.The Role of Herbal Medicine in Cholangiocarcinoma Control: A Systematic ReviewReviews 3Na-Bangchang K et al.

The world s highest incidence is re- ported from the northeastern part of Thailand, with an age-stan-dardized incidence rate of 33.4 per 100 000 in males and 12.3 per100 000 in females. It is the second most common hepatic malig-nancy in the world after hepatocellular CCA. Increasing incidenceand mortality from CCA have been reported globally [1]. Severalrisk factors are associated with viverrini and Clonorchis sinensis ). Infection with O. viverrini is a risk factor for al- most all cases of CCA in Thailand [2]. Treatment and control ofCCA remain unsatisfactory due to the lack of sensitive and specificdiagnostic tools for early detection, as well as effective drugs. Theoverall 5-year survival rate of CCA patients is less than 5%. Surgicalresection is the curative treatment option eligible for patients with an early-stage tumor. Gemcitabine and/or cisplatin-based chemotherapy is the first-line treatment option for patients withadvanced or metastatic disease. However, the effectiveness ofthese drugs is limited, with the median overall survival of less than1 year [3]. The growing incidence of CCA and limited treatmentoptions hasten a pressing demand for research and developmentof new chemotherapeutics against CCA. In recent years, natural products and the research and devel- opment of herbs for cancer chemotherapy have been an intensive area of research. This is due to the diverse chemical structures andbioactivities of herbs that could be exploited as promising drugcandidates for various types of cancer. Numerous studies havebeen carried out to discover effective cancer chemotherapeuticagents from plant sources with low toxicity. Examples of success-ful drugs for study was to systemati- cally review herbs and herb-derived compounds that have beeninvestigated for their anti-CCA potential both in vitro, in vivo ,a n d humans.

Other plants with more than three research articles published on antiproliferative activities in-cluded G. Nees. The previously reported studies of various potential herbs (extracts or isolated compounds/synthelicanalogs) for CCA focused on their antiproliferative activities against CCA cell lines or antitumor activities in animal models, ac- tivities on cell invasion and migration, and underlying mecha-nisms or targets of their actions [5 -155]. None herbs/iso- lated compounds/synthetic analogs, except A. lancea (Thunb.) DC., has undergone the full process of nonclinical, clinical, andpharmaceutical development to deliver final products for clinicaluse. The IC 50(concentration that inhibits cell growth by 50%) val- ues indicating the potency of activities were not reported for most herbs/isolated compounds/synthetic analogs/herbal formu- lations investigated. The potency of activity of the antiprolifera-tive activity against human CCA cells was classified according tothe IC 50as (i) weak activity (IC 50> 100 \u00b5g/mL for the herbal ex- tract and > 100 \u00b5M for the isolated compounds/synthetic ana-logs), (ii) moderate activity (IC 5010-100 \u00b5g/mL for the herbal ex- tract and 10 -100 \u00b5M for the isolated compounds/synthetic ana- logs), and (iii) relatively potent (IC 50< 10 \u00b5g/mL for the herbal ex- tract and < 10 \u00b5M for the isolated compounds/synthetic analogs). Based on available published data, the antiproliferative activitiesof the extracts of A. lancea (Thunb.) DC., G. hanburyi Hook.f., and Piper nigrum L. (Piperaceae) are classified as potent [5 -7], while and Pra-Sa-Prao-Yhai formulation are classified as moderate [5,8 -11], and that of sho-saiko-to is classified as weak activity[12]. For the isolated compounds/synthetic analogs, those with the most potent activity are cucurbitacin B and triptolide moderated to potent activ- ities (Table 1 ). Possible molecular mechanisms of these herbs and/or isolated compounds/synthetic analogs on CCA cells in-volve induction of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest (atG G 2/M phases) through suppression TRAF1, XIAP, p21, ) [7,11,16,19,25,26,30,31,37,38,42, 45,49,54,66,70,78,79, 89-120].

The most advanced development of a potential herb as a che- motherapeutic agent for CCA is A. lancea (Thunb.) DC. A series of studies on the research and development of A. lancea (Thunb.) DC. was systematically conducted by our research group [121].A. lancea (Thunb.) DC. is a medicinal plant growing in tropical and subtropical zones of East Asia such as China and Japan. Itsdried rhizome is commonly used in Chinese ( \"Cang Zhu nese campo ( \"So-jutsu \"), and Thai ( \"Khod-Kha-Mao \") traditional medicines for fever, colds, flu, sore throat, rheumatic diseases, di- gestive disorders, night blindness, influenza, rheumatic diseases,digestive disorders, night blin dness, and cancers. Modern phar- macological studies also support the broad pharmacological ef-fects of A. lancea (Thunb.) DC. in various dis eases [122]. Phyto- chemical investigations reveal a series of (14%), BE (6%), atractylon (2%), and HS (1%). The potential ofA. lancea (Thunb.) DC. and the two major compounds AT and BE for treatment and control of CCA has extensively been evaluatedboth in vitro (human CCA cell lines) and in vivo (xenograft mouse model and OV/DMN-induced CCA hamster model) [121,124,125]. Results confirm anti-CCA potential and safety profiles ofboth the crude A. lancea (Thunb.) DC. extract, as well as AT and BE and the finished product [capsule pharmaceutical formulation of the standardized A. lancea (Thunb.) DC. extract] [126,127]. A. lancea (Thunb.) DC. and both compounds exhibit potent and selective antiproliferative activities against CCA cells. The IC 50val- ues range from 20 to 30 \u00b5g/mL, with a selectivity index of 3 -5 [128,129]. The potencies of activity of A. lancea (Thunb.) DC. and both compounds on CCA cell growth is about 3- to 4-fold ofthe standard drug 5-FU. Furthermore, A. lancea (Thunb.) DC. ex- tract, AT, and BE inhibit CCA cell invasion and migration and for- mation of new blood vessels [86,128,130 -132], suggesting a po- tential role as an antiangiogenesis agent anticancer and antiangiogenesis properties ofA. lancea (Thunb.) DC. extract and its major constituents have been demonstrated in various types of cancer, e.g., murine blasto-ma cells HeLa (human cervical cells), SGC- 7901 (human gastric cancer cells), BEL-7402 (human liver cancer cells), H33, S180, HL-60, leukemic cells, and gastric cancer [131 -135]. The underlying mechanisms of the antiproliferative effects of A. lancea (Thunb.) DC., AT, and BE against CCA cells mainly involve the induction ofcell cycle arrest (at G 1phase) and apoptosis through activation or suppression of molecular targets/signaling pathways involved inCCA pathogenesis. These include the activation of caspase-3/7and suppression of HO1 production, activation of STAT1/2 andJAK/STAT signaling cascades, suppression of NF B, and suppres- sion of cytoprotective enzymes and key growth regulatory transcription factors [38,41,42,62,98 -100]. The first-in-human starting dose was estimated from the MRSD (maximum recom-mended starting dose) from toxicology testing in animals [136],which was 2400 mg for a person weighing 60 kg. Despite the con-cern of bleeding (antiplatelet aggregation) and adverse effect onthe nervous system previously reported in vitro and in animals [123], results of phase I clinical trials using 1 g A. lancea (Thunb.) DC. (about 50% of the estimated maximum dose in humans) con- firmed the safety profile in healthy Thai subjects [124]. The phar-macokinetics of AT was investigated in healthy Thai subjects fol- lowing a single (1 g) or daily (1 g for 21 days) administration ofthe capsule formulation of the standardized A. lancea (Thunb.) DC. extract [124]. AT was rapidly absorbed but with low systemicbioavailability and a short residence time (within 8 h). The immu-nostimulatory activity of the standardized A. lancea (Thunb.) DC. extract was linked with suppression of the production of TNF- and IL6 cytokines, which are involved in the pathogenesis and se- verity of CCA [137]. A phase II dose-finding study is underway to confirm efficacy, tolerability, and immunomodulatory activity ofA. lancea (Thunb.) DC. in patients with advanced-stage CCA. It is noted for the toxic effect of AT and BE on zebrafish embryo devel-opment [86]. Although the results may imply similar toxicity inhumans, considering the much more sensitivity of the zebrafishmodel compared with mammalian cells and rodent models, highintensity of the effect would not be expected in humans. Further studies are needed to confirm this finding. Apart from A. lancea (Thunb.) DC., C. longa L.,G .h a n b r y i A. annua L.,Z. officinale Roscoe, and A. paniculata (Burm. f.) Nees are among the herbs that have been of research interestfor anti-CCA development. Curcumin is a major component ofC. longa or turmeric. It is a dietary constituent with tumor-sup- pressing potential by inhibiting multiple molecular targets/signal-ing pathways involved in carcinogenesis, including CCA. Curcumin and synthetic analogs exhibit potent antiprolifertive activities against human CCA cells with IC 50values of 3 -17 \u00b5M [24,27]. However, clinical uses of curcumin in CCA and other types of can-cer may be limited due to its low systemic bioavailability [138]. Itinhibits cell migration and induces cell cycle arrest at the G 2/M phase [66]. The action of curcumin in CCA involves 15), and Notch1 signaling [25,26,66,83,106,107,109,110]. The of G. hanburyi Hook.f. extract and isolated compounds/synthetic analogs have been well demon-strated in various types of cancer [139]. G. hanburyi forbesione, iso-morellin, and isomorellinol, etc.) from the resin and fruits have been used widely in Thai traditional medicine [51]. Gambogic acid was shown to have a favorable safety profile in a phase II a trial inpatients with advanced malignant tumors, i.e., lung, gastrointes-tinal, liver, breast, and renal adenocarcinoma [ 140]. Neverthess, no clinical study was conducted in patients with advanced-stageCCA. The antiproliferative activity of both the extract (IC 50=2- 3 \u00b5g/mL) and isolated compounds/synthetic analogs(IC 50=0 . 0 3 -3 is [6,51]. The extract and caged xanthones induce apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway [51] and induction of G 0/G1-phase cell cycle arrest through p53 and NF B signaling pathways [52]. Combinations of isomorellin or forbesione with doxorubicin exhibited a significant synergisticeffect on CCA cells through suppression of MRP1, activation ofNFB, enhancement of Bcl2-like protein 4 (Bax)/Bcl2, activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and suppression of the expression ofsurvivin, procaspase-9, and procaspase-3 [112]. The combination of forbesione with 5-FU strongly suppressed the expression of 11Na-Bangchang K et al. The Role of ...Planta Med 2023; 89: 3 -18 | \u00a9 2022. Thieme. All rights reserved.

Bcl2 and procaspase-3 while enhancing the expression of p53, Bax, Apaf-1, caspase-9 and caspase-3 compared with single-drugtreatment [111]. The safety profile of gambogic acid in humanstogether with its potent antiproliferative activity against CCAmake this compound a strong candidate for further developmentas a CCA chemotherapeutic agent. In addition, gambonic acid isavailable in the parenteral which is suitable annua L. constitute a unique class of antimalarial drugs with significant potential for drug repurposing for a wide rangeof diseases, including cancer [141]. The antiproliferative activitiesof artemisinins against CCA cells are relatively weak (IC 50=7 5 - 377 \u00b5M) [37]. The mechanisms of their action against CCA havebeen reported to involve multiple critical biological targets/signal- ing pathways through induction of both apoptosis and autophagy-dependent caspase-independent cell death and cell cycle arrest S, G 0/G1,a n dG 2/M. Z. officinale Roscoe, or ginger, is a popular spice used globally, especially in most Asian countries. It has been used as a pain relieffor arthritis, muscle soreness, chest pain, low back pain, stomach pain, and menstrual pain. The rhizomes contain over 400 different compounds. The phenolic compounds gingerol and shogaol arefound in higher quantities than others. Evidence from in vitro , ani- mal, and epidemiological studies suggest that ginger and its ac-tive constituents suppress the growth and induce apoptosis of avariety of cancer types, including skin, ovarian, colon, breast, cer-vical, oral, renal, prostate, gastric, pancreatic, liver, and brain can-cer. The active ingredients of ginger, mainly, 6-gingerol and 6shogaol, target several cellular molecules that contribute to tu- morigenesis, cell survival, cell proliferation, invasion, and angio-genesis (NF B, Rb, vitro stud- ies showed that ginger has promising antiprolifertive and antioxi-dant activities against human CCA cells by inducing programmedcell death [11, 84]. The ethanolic extract of ginger exhibits signifi- cant tumor growth inhibition, prolongs survival time, and in- creases survival rate in CCA-xenografted mice and OV/DMN-in-duced CCA in hamsters. In the xenograft model, the crude extractof ginger produced significant anti-CCA activity compared withcisplatin and the untreated control. The extract at medium (1 g/kg body weight) and high (2 g/kg body weight) dose levels (oraldaily dose for 30 days) significantly inhibited tumor growth toabout 55.6 and 51.1% of the untreated control, respectively, while cisplatin inhibited tumor growth to 60% of the control [84]. Inter- estingly, significant reduction of lung metastasis was observed inthe xenografted mice treated with the crude extract of ginger andcisplatin compared with the untreated control. In OV/DMN-in-duced CCA hamsters, promising anti-CCA activity of the crude ex-tract of ginger was observed at all dose levels, particularly at thehighest oral dose level of 5 g/kg body weight for 30 days [143].The median survival rate and survival time were significantly pro- longed (about two times) in hamsters treated with the extract atall dose levels compared with 5-FU-treated and untreated control groups during the 4 -6 months observation period. At week 36, all hamsters except those treated with the highest ginger dose died(1 hamster died, 80% survival rate). The untreated control animalsstarted to die as early as 14 weeks. A. paniculata (Burm.f.) Nees is an important herbal medicine widely used in several Asian countries, including China, India, andThailand, for the treatment of respiratory infection, inflammation, immunostimulation, hepatoprotective, cardioprotective, cold, fever, bacterial dysentery, diarrhea, and hypoglycemic and anti-cancer activities [144 -149]. Recently, the Ministry of Public Health of Thailand has approved A. paniculata (Burm.f.) Nees for the treatment of COVID-19 [150]. A. paniculata (Burm.f.) Nees and its active compound andrographolide have been shown to in-hibit cancer cell migration and invasion, including CCA. Due totheir low potencies of activity and requirement of a large dose [151], number nanoencapsu-lated formulation, have recently been developed with improvedactivities against CCA (IC 50= 3 \u00b5M) [17, 18]. These analogs and nanoformulation exhibit potent activity against CCA cells. The in-hibitory effect on CCA cell proliferation is through induction ofapoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the G o/G1and G 2/M phases through downregulation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase occurs [60]. Andrographolide was alsoshown to inhibit CCA cell invasion and migration via suppressionof claudin 1 through the activation of p38 MAPK signaling [19].The long history of use and relatively safe profile [152] togetherwith evidence of the potency of antiproliferative activity againsthuman cells make A. paniculata (Burm.f.) Nees extract or andrographolide a candidate as a repurposed drug for CCA. Resveratrol and capsaicin are among other reported com- pounds derived from several plant species that have been investi-gated for anti-CCA activities [73,75 -77]. Resveratrol is a polyphe- nol found naturally in red wine, grapes, mulberries, cranberries,and peanuts. The compound exhibits cancer chemopreventive ac-tivity through inhibition of tumor initiation, promotion, and pro-gression. In CCA cell lines, resveratrol was shown to interfere withcell cycle progression, resulting in arresting different phases of the cell cycle (G o/G1,S ,a n dG 2phases) to induce apoptosis pathway IL6 CAFs secretory product [76]. It also produces the effect of 5-FU on CCA growth inhibition on different gastrointes- tinal cancer cells [154]. The anti-CCA activity of capsaicin was shown to be associated with the induction of apoptosis and at-tenuation of the GLI1 and Hedgehog (role in carcinogenesis) [101 -102]. The use of capsaicin as a food supplement to inhibit Hedgehog signaling might there-fore be of additional therapeutic benefit in patients with CCA. Inthe xenograft mouse model, a combination of capsaicin with5FU was synergistic and significantly suppressed tumor growth compared with 5-FU alone. Further investigation revealed that 12Na-Bangchang K et al. The Role of ...Planta Med 2023; 89: 3 -18 | \u00a9 2022. Thieme.

The mechanism of action was shown to be through the inhibition of5-FU-induced autophagy by activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR sig-naling pathway [103]. Herbs constitute a promising source of medicine for CCA con- trol. The anti-CCA potential of several herbs and isolated com-pound/synthetic analogs have been demonstrated in different ex-perimental models in conjunction with their underlying mecha- nisms of action at the molecular and cellular levels. As herbal medicines usually contain several pharmacologically active com-pounds, their multi-ingredient characteristics may make the eval-uation of clinically useful products more complex than syntheticdrugs. With regard to the therapeutic aspect, however, using thewhole herbal extract would be expected to provide more thera-peutic benefit compared to synthetic drugs concerning efficacy(synergistic action) and tolerability (buffering effect). The limita- tion of the current study includes only articles published in English were included in the analysis and the number of the reportedarticles may therefore be underestimated. Comparison of the po-tencies of antiproliferative activities of the investigated plants/iso-lated or synthetic compounds/herbal formulations was madebased on only available data on the IC 50values, which were not reported in some studies. Some reported the antiproliferativeactivity potencies as the percentage of inhibitory effects on cell growth at specified concentrations. In addition, different CCA cell lines and assay methods for assessment of antiproliferative activ-ities were used in different studies. In conclusion, a number of plants, isolated compounds, syn- thetic analogs, and herbal formulations have been demonstratedfor their potential to control CCA. However, only A. lancea (Thunb.) DC. was fully developed based on the reverse pharma-cology approach. Future research should be geared toward the full development of the candidate herbs until delivery of final products that are safe and effective for CCA control. Other targetsof their action should be further investigated. Research targetinginflammatory, proliferative, and angiogenesis processes, develop-ment, and progression has been an extensive area. Blocking thegeneration of an inflammatory infiltrate by interfering with criticalmolecules of the adhesion process is an attractive strategy to con-trol CCA. Materials and Methods This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Pre-ferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses(PRISMA) guidelines [156]. D a t a b a s ea n ds e a r c hs t r a t e g y The literature search was conducted from three databases, i.e.,PubMed, ScienceDirect, and \"AND/OR \"Traditional medicine \"AND/ OR\"Plants \".
