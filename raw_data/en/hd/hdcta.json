With the prevalence of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) increasing in western societies, questions of the ethical justication of these alternative health care approaches and practices have to be addressed. In order to evaluate philosophical reasoning on this subject, it is of paramount importance to identify and analyse possible arguments for the ethical justication of CAM consideringcontemporary biomedical ethics as well as more fundamental philosophical aspects. Moreover, it is vital toprovide adequate analytical instruments for this task, such as separating 'CAM as belief system' and'CAM as practice'.Findings show that benecence and non-malecence are central issues for an ethicaljustication of CAM as practice, while freedom of thought and religion are central to CAM as beliefsystem. Many justication strategies have limitations and qualications that have to be taken into account.Singularly descriptive premises in an argument often prove to be more problematic than universal ethical principles. Thus, non-ethical issues related to a general philosophical underpinning - e.g. epistemology, semantics, and ontology - are highly relevant for determining a justication strategy, especially whenstrong metaphysical assumptions are involved. Even if some values are shared with traditionalbiomedicine, axiological dierences have to be considered as well. Further research should be doneabout specic CAM positions. These could be combined with applied qualitative social research methods. Key words: alternative health care, applied ethics, CAM, complementary and alternative medicine, ethical justication of complementary and alternative medicine, medical ethics Introduction In the recent decades, the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has become an everyday issue in health care. Several studies inmodern western societies claim that up to 50percent of the population commonly use CAM-related therapies (for example Barnes et al., 2004for the U.S.A.; Ernst, 2000 for the U.K.; Thorneet al., 2002). A literature review conducted byAstin et al. (1998) stated that in industrialized nations large numbers of physicians refer to CAM therapies and believe in their usefulness andeciency. In Switzerland, the representative studyof Leuenberger and Longchamps (2001) abouthopes and expectations of medicine, on behalf ofthe Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences (SAMS),showed that roughly 60% of the populationwish, modern medicine would give CAM more consideration. Although many of these studieshave to be treated with care due to dierent methodologies, cultural background and years studied, this development is clearly distinguishable. As the interest in CAM increases it is argued whether CAM can be justied on an individual andsocial level. Common discussions often focus onpolitical, 'ideological' or scientic 2(methodologi- cal) levels, whereas there is only little academicwork dedicated to questions of ethical justication of use, oer and promotion of CAM. Even scholarly works from respected medical ethicists,e.g. Daniel Callahan (2002), on the topic seldomaddress those questions systematically and su-ciently. Furthermore, some articles (for exampleThorne et al., 2002; Ernst and Stone, 2004) havethe tendency to focus on issues of research methodsMedicine, Health Care and Philosophy (2007) 10:329-345 /C211Springer 2007 DOI 10.1007/s11019-007-9050-x brought to you by CORE View metadata, citation and similar papers at core.ac.uk provided by RERO DOC Digital Libraryrather than ethics per se . More fundamental questions are seldom examined: How can CAM be ethically justied in general? Which principles may collide with the use of CAM (epistemological reflections on the philosophy ofscience taken into account)? Where might be thelimits of justication? What philosophical under-pinnings have to be reflected upon? This paper will try to give an exploratory report focussed on fundamental justication issues. Aim and method The paper uses a philosophical analysis of possible and plausible ethical justications for the generaluse of CAM. The epistemic aim of the paper willnot be to give nal answers to all posed questions.Rather, the paper tries to provide a systematic analysis of principles, concepts and values that can be considered relevant to this debate. In addition itwill help to reveal and to systematize assumptionsand principles involved. Philosophical disclaimer The paper is written from a western perspective and according to the tradition of 'analytic' philos- ophy. Preliminaries Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) To provide a nal denition for 'CAM' is difcult, and perhaps impossible. Some authors deny theexistence of a universal denition because CAM ismainly historically and culturally constituted (a'social construct') like 'traditional medicine'. It hasto be stressed that the term is sensitive to thesituation in different contexts. Therefore, onlygenetic denitions that pay attention to the context of origin can be given (e.g. Drane, 1995; Dalen, 1998). One context-sensitive denition is theEisenberg-denition based on the criteria of med- ical interventions that are not taught widely atmedical schools (Eisenberg et al., 1993). Other approaches eliminate the use of the term 'CAM'altogether, and propose using an 'evidence basedmedicine' approach: if a treatment is adequately tested, it becomes mainstream (accepted) medicine (Angell and Kassirer, 1998; Fontanarosa andLundberg, 1998). Furthermore it seems that thereexist mostly negative denitions (e.g. Ernst andStone, 2004). On the base of biomedicine (appli- cation of the principles of natural science to clinicalmedicine) CAM is dened ex negative . Therefore an extensional denition is given rather than an intensional one. Even the National Centre forComplementary and Alternative Medicine(NCCAM) in the United States provides a negativedenition: ''[CAM] is a group of diverse medicaland health care systems, practices, and productsthat are not presently considered to be part ofconventional medicine'' (NCCAM, 2006). Addi- tionally, such an approach is problematic since it depends extensively on the meaning of 'conven-tional medicine', a term that has no clear denitioneither. Denitions based on 'social construction' may be pragmatically useful (as they for example giveaccount to different laws in different countries),but are philosophically unsatisfactory: rstly because of the well-known problem of what should be understood under 'social construct'(Hacking, 1999); secondly because characteristicsof a denition construct'could eventually be toodependant on social/ political contexts (e.g. just descriptions of thebeliefs of dierent social groups). In this wayrelevant aspects (social and non-social, e.g. cog- nitive ones) of the phenomenon 'CAM' might be ignored. Fuller establishes three reasons why a therapy is labeled as unorthodox or 'alternative' (Fuller,1995): (1) alternative worldview (relative to 'wes-tern mainstream' or 'mainstream western medi-cine'), mainly derived from a spiritual belief system(e.g. New Age medical systems); (2) not validated by orthodox medical standards (e.g. many cancer treatments); and (3) a therapy is a service outside ofmedical mainstream that is ignored or deemed ofsecondary importance (e.g. midwifery). The sug-gested denition for this paper will focus on CAMin the sense of Fuller (1). This unfortunately willlead to some 'simplicism'. It must be granted thatsome issues which will be analysed, proposed and assumed in this paper do not have the same bearing for all therapies, remedies and belief systems whichare or might be referred to as CAM. This especiallyapplies to those referred to in Fuller's meanings (2)and (3). In addition to common understandings ofthe concept 'CAM' as seen in this section, it mightprove fruitful to dierentiate analytically between'CAM as practice ' and 'CAM as belief system '. Since the paper focuses especially on CAM relying on an 'alternative world view', the followingcharacteristics are deemed important for thisMARCEL MERTZ 330purpose, and have to be understood as being part of a stipulative, explicative denition : A thing x is called CAM (1) if (necessary, but not sufcient requirement): It is claimed that x is able to heal illness (or at leastcertain kinds of illnesses) and/or to explain illness,and x is not considered 'mainstream/orthodoxmedicine', and x has at least one of the followingcharacteristics (x's that full more or less thesecharacteristics are stronger or weaker versions ofCAM (1)): -content-oriented metaphysics : x has a content -orien- tated metaphysical fundament concerning disease/health e.g. asserts principles, state of aairs, causalrelations which are considered 'metaphysical', 3 and/or is strongly dependent on the truth of themetaphysical beliefs. Believers and practitioners ofx have explicit 'metaphysical commitments'. 4 -metaphysical explanations : x gives metaphysical (instead of physical, biological or psychological)explanations of the causes of physical illness (Ful- ler, 1995). -'holism' : if x is entitled to have benets that can be classied to be mental, psychological, social and spiritual, then x claims to be 'holistic' in itshealing eect (Ernst and Stone, 2004). -'spiritual world view' : if x gives metaphysical explanations for disease/health and if x isconsiderably a 'spiritual world view' (Ruhl,2002), then the metaphysical beliefs of CAMare related to supernaturalism and/or some kind of mind-body-dualism (if idealism is not embraced); -vitalism : if x is a 'spiritual world view' and x pro- poses that there is a distinct 'life force' that is rel-evant to disease/health, then vitalism ofthe metaphysical belief system of x; -'magical thinking' : If x is vitalistic and x is enti- tled to heal through this 'life force', or to use it, then x relies on 'magical thinking', proposing magic healing powers or an ''unlimited therapeu-tic power of the mind'' (Kaptchuk and Miller,2005). I would further suggest that with regard to 'metaphysical commitment' and the great varietyof CAM one should think rather in a continuumthan in a simple dichotomy. In this continuum,the instances of CAM that have less 'metaphysicalcommitment' and may seek scientic acceptanceare located on the left side. On the right side are instances of CAM which have a strong 'metaphysical commitment'. Here CAM will notonly be a medicine , but also a spiritual world-view e.g. religious faith healing. Values An important thing concerning values is that therecould also be axiological differences in the analysedpositions: biomedicine and CAM could rely onother axiologies that imply a different hierarchy ofvalues. Perhaps biomedicine, as a scientic enter-prise, values truth and knowledge higher as the subjective (psychologically) well-being of a person, while certain CAM positions might value thismuch higher than truth and knowledge. Axiolog-ical differences are hard to come by, as it is difcultto justify a hierarchy of value. It is especiallydifcult to prove the value of truth above all othervalues, as it is often traditionally upheld inphilosophy of science and perhaps in science itself (Kitcher, 2001). Finally, positions may differ in the 'value of a value': is a given value an intrinsic or extrinsicvalue? For example, it might be that CAMpositions regard truth more as an extrinsic valuethan an intrinsic one, whereas biomedical sciencestend to regard truth as an intrinsic value. Analytical levels of ethics in CAM/focus of the paper It is important to make a distinction between threespecic analytical levels where one can pose ques-tions in relation to ethics in CAM 5: Level 1: (Practical) Ethics in the actual case of using CAM; medical ethos, question: '' How should we act when using/oering/promotingCAM? What is morally obligated, permitted orforbidden?'' (perspective of patient-physician rela-tionship while consenting to a treatment, ethicalresponsibility of a health care provider and research ethics inclusive) Level 2: Ethics about questions of oer and pro-motion of CAM as a health care provider in treatment decision and information; question:''Should I actually use/oer/promote CAM? Is it morally obligated, permitted, forbidden to sug-gest or to oer CAM?'' (perspective of patient-physician relationship, ethical responsibility of a health care provider) Level 3: Ethics about questions of use, oer andpromotion of CAM in a society in general ; ques- tion: '' Should we use/oer/promote CAM? Is CAM itself morally obligated, permitted, forbid- den?'' (societal and 'fundamental' perspective)COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 331Level 1 is not the subject matter of the following analysis. While level 1 is quite important in apractical context and should not be disregarded, it nonetheless lacks a more fundamental reflection insofar as the justied general use of CAM isalready (implicitly) accepted or is just presupposed.Hence, analytically speaking, level 1 must truly begranted, and it must be clear how it may be granted(through considerations of level 2 and 3) beforebeginning to answer the questions of level 1. Whilst there is some academic work primarily for level 1, and to a certain degree also level 2 (see for example Wardell Engebretson, 2004), level 2 and especially level 3 are lessrepresented and seldom directly addressed. General abbreviations used in argument analysis On the left side of the tables (logical structure): 'Px'stands for 'Premise Nr. x'; Nr. x'. 'A' stands for 'Axiom'. 'C'stands for 'Conclusion'. On the right side of the tables (sentence types), only where relevant: 'D' stands for 'descriptive', 'universal' and 's' means 'singularly' related to the extension of application(especially principles) or to the use of universal/existential quantier. Standard ethical principles of bioethics (Level 2) On level 2, we can use established concepts and principles of bioethics, as referred to in Beau-champ and Childress (2001) and Hiller (1986), as'theories of the middle range'. While these princi-ples are used for determining and reflecting theoutcome of practical decisions in a concretemedical context on level 1, they provide a framingof the more fundamental question on level 2: should a certain treatment option be oered, promoted, or used? Level 1 'as a whole' could be used for justifying issues if the premise is stated that a practice whichgenerates high 'moral distress', because of lackingethical standards, is overall ethically problematic.If CAM would imply severe ethical problems ifapplied, then CAM would be ethically problem- atic. Wardell and Engebretson, (2001, p. 332) stress the point that many practitioners in CAM practiceare ''complementary to or integrated withinbiomedicine'' and have a dierent legal status and ethical responsibility. ''Typically'', so Wardellet al., ''they [practitioners] provide care to a self-selected clientele with homogenous beliefs and expectations''; CAM is ''private medicine''(Ernst and Stone, 2004). Some CAM therapies dorelate directly to the belief system of a patient. Thiscan go as far as other treatments ('alternative' andtraditional ones) are not chosen instead of theCAM therapy corresponding to the patient's beliefsystem (Ruhl, 2002; Adams et al., 2002). Respect for patient autonomy Principle: A patient has the right to choose the treatment she/he prefers, including to choosebetween biomedicine and CAM. The concept ofpatient autonomy entails that the person also hasthe authority to determine what makes a good life for her/him (eudaimonistic dimension). This even counts in situations where others might consider adierent decision to be better. Values: Liberty, agency, and happiness. Justication: Limits and problems: Patient autonomy (IC) as an established concept of bioethics and located on anindividual ethics level can justify CAM or at least many aspects of it. As long as the choice of treatment is at liberty of the patient (at least notcoerced) (P3) there is no ethical reason against theuse of CAM as practice (CAM as belief system is not justiable with this principle, as it is relatedto decision making, not to holding a belief).The principle has its limits, though. Firstly, itdepends solely on the individual level without taking institutional and social levels into account. Secondly, not all preferences are legally and/orP0 A person has the ceteris paribus right to freely make decisions on her/his own. (autonomy )D/N u IC [P0]: A patient x is allowed to choose the treatment option she/he prefers.Nu P1 The decision of patient x has to be respected.Pu P2 CAM practice y is a possible treatment option for the given illness.Ds P3 Patient x freely chooses the treatment option CAM y.Ds C CAM practice y is allowed (used/ oered) and the choice has to be respected.PsMARCEL MERTZ 332morally acceptable. It should be clear that there have to be constraints in general on what one canfreely choose. Thirdly, not all that we prefer and choose is necessarily 'wise'. This refers to the epistemic dimension as well. Since some CAM-positions have very strong spiritual beliefs, apatient might choose a CAM therapy even if thereis plenty of evidence that the therapy is notbenecial (Adams et al., 2002). This occursbecause a patient chooses the therapy accordingto her/his (spiritual) belief system (''Do persons have a right to what seems to be an utterly ineective therapy simply because it conforms totheir personal belief system?''; Fuller, 1995, p.133). Such situations pose questions on how farthe patient's autonomy might reach, in particularwhen the ethical responsibility of the health careprovider is considered. Interestingly, autonomy seems also to be granted at the 'spiritual level' in CAM. A practitioner ''could obtain spiritual permissionat the unconscious level, which was considered asimportant as or more important than consciouspermission'' (Wardell and Engebretson, 2001, p.327). In regard of contemporary issues of auton-omy in bioethical context and for informedconsent (see Informed Consent ), this goes beyond any intersubjective state of aairs that can be shown to express and document the autonomy ofa patient. Misuses and misinterpretations thatseem to be likely with such an approach toautonomy harbour ethical problems on theirown. However, they can also be used as ageneral ethical (and epistemological) objectionto CAM practices relating to such ''spiritual permission at the unconscious level''. Paternalism as justication for CAM Paternalism is a concept which values the episte- mic authority of health care providers, regardingmedical-concerned issues, higher than the rightof the patient to participate in the decision-making process. The paternalistic perspective was reduced, but not fully given up, for more autonomy-based perspectives in the last half ofthe century (Troehler and Reiter-Theil, 1998).Wardell and orientated towards paternalismthan biomedicine; this especially concerns thosepositions located at the very right side of thesuggested CAM-continuum. It might be that the patient (or 'client') respects the practitioner as a 'wise person' with the capability of ''[brokering]with the god(s) and spirits to accomplish healing'' (Wardell and Engebretson, 2001, p. 321). Theimportance of the virtue (of the practitioner) is thoroughly stressed by complementary healing and nursing (Wardell and Engebretson, 2001).Wardell and Engebreton assume that this empha-sis on the character of the practitioner is relatedto the central part that spirituality plays inhealing. The following argument could be a paternalistic justication for CAM: What gives strength to a paternalistic justica- tion of CAM is not just the higher competence inknowing how to possibly heal someone (P2) (which could also be said of biomedicine), but a higher spiritual competence which entails more than just adequate ways of healing (such as eudaimonisticperspectives). Some CAM-practitioners might as-sert that biomedicine lacks the competence ofhealing (or 'really' healing). They may argue thattheir approaches understand human well-beingbetter and are ''cognizant of mental, moral, and spiritual factors that go well beyond the physio- logical considerations on which scientic medicinerelies.'' (Fuller, 1995, p. 133). Since the practitio-ners are the only group capable of ('really') healingit is justied not to only use and oer CAM butalso to promote it. Benecence Principle: The principle is mainly orientated to- wards an individual ethics level, but can also beused for extended ethical considerations, forgroups and institutions. It depends on how farone looks at benecial eects. For the sake ofsimplicity, the extension of the principle will bekept open in the following. Values: Values of health and the value of relief.P1 The person with the highest competence (knowledge, skill, virtue) must decide.Pu P2 A practitioner x knows how to heal and deal with the illness y through 'spiritual insight' z(or a similar skill).Ds P3 A patient s (or a physician t) does not have this knowledge or skill z.Ds C Practitioner x (and not physician t) must de- cide on behalf of patient s.PsC OMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 333Justication: Limits and problems: The principle of benecence can be used for CAM-justication. If it is ethicallyobligated to do everything to increase the patient's health and CAM is such a way (or even a 'better' way), CAM as practice is justied. However, the principle can solely be used as justication if a CAM-therapy does actually pro-vide benet in health care (P2), and/or this can bepredicted with sufcient certainty to prevent ''casesof excessive claims, exaggerated promises, anddeception and fraud'' (Ernst and Stone, 2004, p. 158). Otherwise it would violate both the benecence and non-malecence principles asreports on adverse alternative beliefsystem'' and ''anecdotal evidence of therapy eec-tiveness'' cannot be considered sucient for satis- fying ethical obligations (Drane, 1995, p. 141). This refers to a common topic in CAM-related discussions, especially on behalf of CAM-critics: Isa ''it works '' (as it is put by some critics) sucient to declare a CAM therapy as a meaningful healthbenet? And is this benet really in relation to theillness (P3)? What if this 'working' is a consequenceof a logical or cognitive fallacy 6or of biases (Beyerstein, 1999) or relies solely on psychological eects (placebo-eect)? As one will remark, thequestion of benecence depends also on descriptive states of aairs and on conceptual issues. This is rather important in respect of different concepts of 'healing' which are questionably usedin biomedicine and CAM, as such concepts arealso constituted by historical and cultural factors (Drane, 1995). Some studies and comments (War- Fuller, 1995)indicate that practitioners in CAM have a broader use of the concept of healing, of incorporatingaspects of love and relationships, as well as of the patient's spiritual existence that goes beyond a more traditional disease/cure focus (Wardell andEngebretson, 2001, p. 331). As Thorne et al.(2002) note, health care consumers are their experience'' thanto the ''disease which traditional medicineis entitled. Also, unlike biomedical research,placebo-eects might not be seen as a negative result concerning therapy evaluation (although the therapy itself does not heal). However, it might beviewed as part of a 'holistic' approach thatencompasses comfort measures in its healingconcept (Thorne et al., 2002). Thus the use ofplacebo would not be seen as a medical fraud. Theproblem of fraud in medical treatment is oftenperceived as a focal point of the ethical contro- versy in CAM-debates (Fuller, 1995). Therefore, it poses the important question that if the patientsare eventually 'better o', (deliberate) fraud,placebo-eects or lying to the patients and theoer of such treatments in a society are ethicallyjustiable. Non-malecence Principle: The principle exemplies an essential part of the physician's ethos: rst, do not harm ! Values: Health and relief. Justication: Limits and problems: The principle of non-malef- icence might be a problem for the ethical justica-tion of CAM as practice because when a CAM- treatment does harm, it obviously collides with the principle. While this sounds trivial it is a majorcritical issue. This is especially important if notonly CAM-therapies that in themselves might behazardous are considered, but also harm indirectly due to not engaging in eective treatment when theCAM-treatment is more or less useless in terms ofhealing a disease (Adams et al., 2002; Carroll, 2003; Drane, 1995), for example leukaemia.

D/E s C CAM practice y is not forbidden (use/oer/ promotion).NsMARCEL MERTZ 334advocate CAM in such situations, e.g. because of patient autonomy, can collide with the physician'sethos. As with the principle of benecence, at this point empirical, descriptive and conceptual con-siderations become not only fruitful, but alsonecessary for the normative questions. Informed consent Principle: An informed consent should make a patient capable of deciding correctly about her/his treatment. An informed consent is dependent on thepatient's competence to understand treatments andtheir consequences and to make reasonable deci-sions. It is also dependent on the ability of the healthcare provider to inform the patent accordingly. Values: The concept of informed consent is now- adays a standard legal and ethical procedure to maintain and promote a patient's autonomy. Justication: Limits and problems: Only 'CAM as practice' is concerned. In the context of CAM, Ernst (2001)highlights three points that constitute ''necessary information'': (a) the probability of beneting from the procedure; (b) the probability of risks associ-ated with the procedure; and (c) the alternativeoptions feasible and available as well as their risksand benets. While this is standard information for biomed- icine, there might be problems in CAM, e.g. alsogive alternative options for CAM (biomedicine) and their risks and benets (P1). Ruhl, (2002)draws attention to a specialty of informed consent in CAM: the so - called ''spiritual informedconsent''. As most CAM have rich spiritual roots, a patient should also be informed by the health care provider about potential conflicts with thespiritual/religious beliefs of the patient when pro-posing a certain CAM treatment. Many peoplewould object to accepting a treatment that entailsbeliefs that would conflict with their own spiritual/religious belief system (Ruhl 2002). As Ernst (2004) commented, the problems of informed consent for CAM are: (a) what informa- tion should be considered as ''necessary andrelevant'' for the informed consent and can this''sucient information'' be provided by the prac-titioner; (b) a rigorously applied informed consentmight lead to serious conflicts of interest in CAM:the practitioner might be obligated to state that thebenet of the treatment is not certain, that possible side eects are not negligible, and that other treatment choices do not have the possibility ofharm; this can deter patients from choosing theCAM treatment. This could have nancial conse-quences for the CAM practitioner who is oftenprivately paid by his patients. Finally, the question arises again of how placebo-effects and lying are to be dealt with. Some CAM-practices might be ethically problem- atic since deliberately not saying truth aboutknown or presumed 'working mechanisms' of apractice collides with the concept of informedconsent. Level 3-considerations Regarding level 3, not only accepted or established bioethical principles and the compliance to theseprinciples are at stake, also epistemological, meta-physical, ontological, semantic and meta-ethicalassumptions must to be taken into account. Thisapplies especially conceding that recent biomedicalethics is founded on the same assumptions as Western biomedicine itself (Thorne et al., 2002). The reflection of these assumptions is philosoph-ically paramount for gaining an adequate accounton the issue. It seems obvious that a position with other philosophical presumptions would make moreassumptions than just utter other empirical claimslike biomedicine. Even the empirical state of affairs would be interpreted in a distinct way - accord- ingly to the philosophical assumptions made by theposition about what counts as 'knowledge' orabout what 'healing' or even 'truth' means (as P0 A decision of a person in health care has to be informed and consent has to be given accord- ingly for a treatment action. ( informed consent )Pu IC [P0]: A patient x has to give informed consent for a treatment y.Pu P1 For an informed consent, all relevant infor- mation about the treatment and treatmentoptions have to be given by the health careprovider z.Pu P2 It is possible to give all relevant information about CAM treatment s.Ds P3 All relevant information about CAM treat- ments is given by the health care provider z, providing veracity.Ds P4 Patient x chooses the CAM treatments and gives informed consent to health care provider z.Ds C CAM treatment s is allowed (used/oered/ promoted).NsC OMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 335Thorne et al., 2002 also note). Thus, it could be that a quite dierent concept of truth is used in aCAM position with a high 'metaphysical commit- ment'. Furthermore, right and wrong could meta- ethically be determined teleological and thusobjectively through the order of nature or (a)god(s) (or something similar). Philosophically it is not sufcient to just rely on scientic experience to refute such a position; inthis respect the position does not accept centralassumptions of contemporary philosophy of sci- ence and scientic methods. Therefore, those assumptions made on behalf of epistemologicaland metaphysical reasons have to be considered. Metaphysically justied values (metaphysical knowledge) Concept: A certain CAM-belief system and the associated CAM-practice is justied because of a metaphysically 'grasped' value or knowledge (dueto a specic epistemic potential that is not availableto all persons, at least not without special trainingand accepting the metaphysical position at hand).These values or knowledge-tokens often claimcertainty and are thus 'absolutely true' and ethi-cally good/right, since it can be assumed that most CAM-related metaphysical positions do not accept the crucial distinction between 'is' and 'ought' asmost modern philosophy does. Values: Specic values related to belief perhaps epistemicvalues ('absolute truth'). Justication:Limits and problems: This type of justication can be confronted especially with a problem concern-ing P0 and P1: 'critic-immunization' and the 'congruency-principle'. The normative power of P3 might be criticized. Surely, also P4 can bedisputed. But I would like to focus on P0/P1 andP3, as they are the most important prerequisites inthis justication strategy. However, it has to be differentiated between two diverse levels where such problems can beidentied: the belief system as such ('theory' of a CAM therapy), and the effects, 'the outcome' ('functionality' of a CAM therapy; see also Out- come of a treatment ). Therefore it can occur that the 'theory' of a CAM therapy is 'critic-immu-nized', but the eects are testable (by scienticstandards). The following sections are more con-cerned with the belief system as such. The problem of 'critic-immunization' The concept of critic- or error-immunization mightprove useful in evaluating CAM-related metaphys-ical positions (strong 'metaphysical commitment').'Critic-immunization' should not be seen as thestrict concept developed by Hans Albert and KarlPopper, but rather as a general (epistemological)attitude or property of a theory which renders it impossible to critically discuss intersubjective state- ments ('dogmatism'). It can also be seen as aminimal requirement of rational enquiry that noclaim stands per se outside of critical examination and criticism. In metaphysical context and regarding CAM this refers to asserting absolute values lyingbeyond the reach of persons or groups who disagree with the position (P0) and to maintaining that no counter-evidence will ever be able toprove the position wrong. 7The problem with such a dedication to a metaphysically 'gained' knowl-edge or value is that it neither lies in reach forevaluation by persons who are not part of theposition, nor in reach for general rational exam-ination. 8 Supposing that there is not only a methodolog- ical but also an ethical obligation to justify one's belief that leads to an action (in particular if thehealth of someone is concerned or crucial rightswould be in danger e.g. a danger to the value ofhuman dignity), a CAM position asserting meta-physical certainty 9for its own sake might nd itself in an ethically problematic state. In such a situa- tion 'critic-immunization' might not only be meth- odologically unsound, but also ethicallyquestionable.A CAM practice relies on CAM belief system.

Are the assertions about metaphysical entities true? Assume that there is enough rational evidenceto refute them or at least enough to lay strong doubt about the truth of them. Obviously the same is true for the normative conclusion if the statements areconsidered false or epistemic highly problematic/disputed. As Quine put it, sooner or later you haveto pay your 'ontological debts': ontologicallypostulating entities can backre epistemologically.Simply asserting them cannot be enough. At least, the principle shows that there can be ethical objections to normative-ethical sentences formulated by CAM positions itself; It can beethically problematic to follow a principle that isderided from questionable premises that are con-cerned with factual statements. On behalf of aposition with high 'metaphysical commitment'though, it must be conceded that if their state-ments would be in fact true, they would also be justied. Outcome of a treatment Concept: A therapy, treatment or remedy does have an 'outcome': how eective was the treat-ment, was the disease healed or does the patient atleast feel better? How burdening was the treatment itself? Values: Health and relief. Justication: There exists an argument of CAM- proponents sometimes used to highlight the advan-tage of CAM contrary to biomedicine that wouldalso entail an ethical superiority:Limits and problems: There are two problems with this argument (though it is valid). Firstly, it uses ahardly stated premise: This descriptive premise is not undisputed as everyone who participates in the ongoing debateabout CAM knows. Primary, the question arises again what could be meant with statements that a remedy or a treatment 'works' and what we meanwith 'heal' (see also Benecence ). Since there is no proof available by modern methodologies, theepistemological dysfunction of anecdotal evidencewhich is used for 'proving' the eectiveness ofCAM-related therapies and remedies is often atstake (Thorne et al., 2002; Carroll, 2003; Glazer, 2005). In relation to the problems of 'critic- immuzation' mentioned earlier, the question arisesif the outcome of a therapy is testable (withscientic methods) and can be judged accordinglyor if even the outcome is somewhat 'critic-immu-nized' (which poses similar problems as discussedinThe problem of 'critic-immunization' ). The second problem refers to another presuppo- sition in premise 2, namely the assumption that CAM treatments can never or at least seldom beharmful. Here, one has to consider the uselessness ofa treatment which might harm indirectly (by deflect-ing from a useful treatment being applied). Justice Concept: On level 3, justice for ensuring equal rights to citizens in a society and for providing thesocial 'framework' within an autonomous subjectmay be used for ethical justication of CAM. Infact, justice as a virtue of social institutions (Rawls,1971, p. 3) can be seen as being a prerequisite for(patient) autonomy on the individual ethics level. Values: Justice can itself be seen as a value. Justice is intertwined with values of personal and social goods, for example with human dignity andethically functioning social systems. Justication: If there is a right to freely choose a treatment (on level 1 and level 2 as part of 'respectof autonomy'), this right must be secured byjustice. Patients preferring biomedical treatmentsmust have the right to do so, but of course the same must be the case for patients preferring CAM treatments. Besides, given the obligation by justice P1 CAM 'works'. Ds P2 CAM does not include surgery, invasive diagnosis or dangerous side-eects as biomedicine does.Ds P3 Treatment without such side-eects is healthier, 'better'. (Thus ethically preferable)Eu C CAM often is the better choice than biomedicine. DsP0 The benecial eects of CAM on health are at least comparable (perhaps sometimes even better) than biomedicine.DsCOMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 337of a government in a social democracy (e.g. Switzerland) to provide health care in the same'amount' and quality to all citizens, CAM might be justied by means of justice if CAM is a sound alternative to biomedicine (see Ethos of science ). Therefore, it could be unfair not to offer CAM, given the justice of considering and offering allrelevant treatment options: Limits and problems: This justication presupposes that CAM is a relevant treatment option (P1).Additionally, the justication can only be used for 'CAM as practice' and when oering CAM. A concern related to distributive justice could, on the other hand, be used against ethical justi-cation of CAM, even only by societies withobligatory health care insurances subsidized by governmental tax (as in Switzerland): it could beconsidered unfair if a large part of the society hasto pay for treatment types (CAM) which they may not approve of and which are directed only towards a small part of the society. Only treat-ments which have shown to be eective andbenecial and are congruent with the interests ofthe population should be part of obligatory healthcare insurances that are subsidized by governmen-tal tax (Thorne et al., 2002). While the qualicationstrengthens the argument, it shifts the burden of proof once again to the question of 'rational' benecence and eectiveness of CAM. Freedom of speech, freedom of thought and freedom of religion A possibility to maintain ethical justication of CAM on the level of social ethics is directed to three intertwined, although separately addressable rights in a democratic society: freedom of speech,thought and religion. A prerequisite of all threerights, in particular for free speech and freethoughts, is a common liberal attitude towardsdemocracy. Freedom of speech Concept: Grants that a citizen may speak (express) freely without censorship. While justications forfreedom of speech (also called 'freedom of expres-sion') can be disputed like all justications (forexample from CAM positions with high 'meta- physical commitment' which are nearly 'closedsocieties' that do not necessarily accept democracy as the best governmental system), it expresses a minimal factual agreement which is also guaran-teed under some laws. Values: Autonomy, equality, tolerance. Justication: Limits and problems: Free speech can be used for justifying CAM belief systems (not CAM prac-tice) or at least the discussion of CAM in a political context. Similar to the freedom of thought (see below), the right to say (express)something does not include the truth of what issaid (expressed). Freedom of thought Concept: Freedom of thought (or 'freedom of belief') is a concept more directed to the right of holding a viewpoint or a belief system irrespective of what the view of others might be; it is the rightto 'believe whatever one wants to believe', justiedmainly by reasons of autonomy. Values: Autonomy, equality, tolerance. Justication: Limits and problems: It is important to realize that freedom of thought means that one has the right tobelieve irrespective of what others think, but this does not mean that what one believes is necessarily right (true) . This 'category mistake' can be rele- vant in regard of the ethical justication of CAM.As mentioned before, the right to believe some-thing is not the same as 'having right' in believingsomething. If I take belief p, p could also be false,P1 All relevant treatment options have to be oered. Pu P2 CAM practice x is a relevant treatment option.

When truth, plausibility, the validity or justi- cation of a belief or a set of beliefs becomes paramount, then this difference also becomesparamount. It is getting philosophically ludicrousto maintain that the right to believe what a CAMposition entails in such situations is tantamount tothe truth of those propositions. In a democraticsociety it would be a dangerous conception, asdangers to individuals, groups and society as a whole could not be assessed and controlled any- more. Therefore, ethically speaking, CAM aspractice can only be justied by means of freedomof belief if there is evidence that it does not harm.Considerations and examination of the truth of thestatements made by CAM positions would againbe important as soon as health and possible risksare concerned. Moreover, it cannot be evaded by relying on free thought. Freedom of religion Concept: Freedom of religion is closely related to the freedom of thought, but often more articulatedin terms of tolerance than in terms of autonomy.The concept incorporates free belief and practice ofa religion and also the freedom not to believe in any religion at all (atheism). Values: Tolerance, autonomy. Justication: Limits and problems: Freedom of religion includes practice s of a religion, but constraints exist regard- ing how religion is practiced. Thus it is problematic to justify a CAM practice that might prove harmful or dangerous or that violates rightsgranted to third parties. Furthermore, relying onfreedom of religion is only an option for CAMpositions with strong 'metaphysical commitment':CAM positions that are quasi-religious or actuallyreligions. Positions of CAM that do not expel high'metaphysical commitment' and are nearer to scientic positions cannot use freedom of religion as a possible justication.Ethos of science Concept: If we accept (stated in a simplied manner) that science is a subsystem of society withspecial epistemic authority (like sociologicallyassumed in the term 'knowledge-society', e.g. VanDuelmen and Rauschenbach, 2004) then the ethosof science also has to be considered, especially if this epistemic authority is extended to or specied for health care issues. A CAM-related therapy orgeneral approach to health care has to withstandobjections concerned with keeping the ethos ofscience as a guarantee for epistemic quality. Thisobjection is of course meaningless if an epistemol-ogy is accepted which favours other forms ofknowledge as epistemic authority (like perhaps some CAM positions with strong 'metaphysical commitment'). Obviously, the epistemologies heldby these positions have to be examined anddebated in that case. If a CAM-related positionclaims to be science or to be justied by scienticmeans the objection is signicant. The concept of the ethos of science which Merton (1942) gave will be used, for reasons of simplicity, even if there was considerable disagree- ment with the concept throughout the years. 10 Values: Truth and knowledge. Justication: Limits and problems: A treatment where the truth (concerning eciency or theory) is questionablemight reasonably be objected to if a health care practitioner is committed to the ethos of science (as it is reasonable to assume that doctors inbiomedicine should be). This would ethically leadto risk/benet-considerations (Adams et al., 2002)as well as critique on theoretical assumptionswhich the treatment is based on. Doubts aboutP1 One has the right to have a religion and to practice it.D/N u P2 CAM belief x is religious-like or a religion.

NsCOMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 339the eectiveness and benecial eects will lead to considerations if the treatment is soundly justiedby reliable knowledge about the world. The norm of organised scepticism (critically examining new and old knowledge claims andtrying to provide and support institutionally,displaying a 'professional sceptical attitude' tobeliefs and assertions) might be one of the mostobjectionable aspects of CAM. Most CAM posi-tions do not regard knowledge as fallible andprovisional as science does (Kaptchuk and Miller, 2005). They sometimes ignore research ndings and often have unrigorous standards for subjectingtherapeutical claims to critical review (Drane,1995). But as champions of science often pointout, it is exactly this kind of attitude and methodthat ''makes science to science'' (e.g. Albert, 1985;Carroll, 2003). A CAM position where such ideals are not realized or are insufciently followed or where social/institutional structures for realizing suchnorms are non-existing can be a target of ethicalrejection (based on arguments that the knowledgeis not reliable, might be harmful or not open tocritical examination). The argument gathers strength regarding CAM positions which assume that their assertions and beliefs are proven to be true by scientic enterprise (even if 'special methodologies' rstly have to beused or invented, for example to cope with the'holistic nature' of most CAM; Ernst and Stone,2004; Adams et al., 2002; Thorne et al. 2002). In other words, positions in CAM with minimal 'metaphysical commitment' which accept or actu-ally propose science and scientic examination in health care issues are thoroughly obligated to the ethos of science and its norms might be criticized ifthey do not feel obliged to maintain the ethos. Legitimation and justication confusions Conceptual confusion is possible in debates about the legitimation and justication of CAM. The term 'Legitimation' relates to a social process or function based on factual agreement(facticity) of values and norms. Legitimation canbe reached by political legitimation (e.g. due to adecision made according to democratic processes)or by legal legitimation (correspondence withfactual law). While this addresses legitimation on a social level there are also 'lesser order' legitima- tions in sub-systems or groups. 'Justication' is the classic term for a rational function in the 'realm of reasons', the 'context ofjustication'. Only validity issues are relevant and not factual agreements or facticity. Justicationcan be related to cognitive justication (Why is x true?), epistemic justication (Why is it reason- able for us to accept proposition x as truth?) andquite obviously also to normative justication(Why is y right? Why is z good?) (Schnaedelbach,2000). Justications are open to rational dis-course, which is an exchange of reasons andcounter-reasons. Additionally, there can be pru-dential justications for actions (Why did you do this? - Because of x), but they lack the categor- ical, non-personal element which is akin tojustications as they are used in rational enter-prises, especially in philosophy. The confusions that can complicate debates about legitimation/justication of CAM are thefollowing ones: rstly, the difference betweenlegitimation and justication might not be re- garded, as it for example takes place when freedom of thought (which is politically legitimized ) is taken as ajustication for a given set of belief. Secondly, some proponents and also opponents may mistakepolitical or legal legitimation with ethical or evenepistemic justication. This confusion is ratherproblematic, because a sole (!) reliance to alegitimation does not justify anything ethically and especially not anything epistemically. The leap from the premise ''x is politically/legally legiti-mized'' to the conclusion ''therefore, x is true/right/good'' would be as obscure as it can get. This takesplace because the 'argument' is prone to a sort ofdemocratic fallacy . An outcome of a sound dem- ocratic process is of course legitimated, but notnecessarily true/right (proven true/right through a process of justication, where reasons for the truth/rightness are given). Furthermore it is notguaranteed that an according conclusion will besupported if a majority thinks that CAM is true orthat CAM should be practiced. Summary CAM can be justied by means of level 2 consid- erations, but often only with qualication, oronly dependent on several descriptive states ofaffairs. Best chances are offered by reliance onpatient autonomy and benecence (as supposed bythe hypotheses). On level 3, there are also possi-bilities of justifying CAM ethically. The best chances can be found in freedom of thought and freedom of religion, while problems are arisingbecause of epistemological reasons in an 'internalview' of CAM positions (as theory evaluation).MARCEL MERTZ 340Table 1 summarizes the possibilities and qual- ications. Conclusions and discussion Central ethical principles in CAM are respect for autonomy, principle of benecence and freedom ofspeech, thought and religion. Collisions with thenon-malecence principle and informed consenthave been shown as likely, while justice might also account positively for CAM. Shared and distinc- tive values between biomedicine and CAM havebeen identied. Epistemological for determining effectiveness andtruth/plausibility of therapies andpositions. Collisions with the ethos of science arelikely, in particular by CAM with strong 'meta-physical commitment'. Principles and universal normative sentences Argumentation, analysis and evaluation haveshown that common objections to a justicationstrategy are rarely oriented towards ethical princi-ples (such as benecence or non-malecence) oruniversal normative sentences, but rather towards singular sentences, especially descriptive ones. Exceptions might be specic normative sentencesdue to 'metaphysical commitment' (e.g. spiritualbeliefs). Benecence and non-malecence As the summary shows, most strategies of justify- ing (or de-justifying) CAM nally refer (as descrip- tive circumstances or as constraints) to issues ofbenecence and non-malecence. It is plausible toassume that these are the most important aspectsconcerning ethical justication of CAM. This is notsurprising for any health care area, althoughproblems arise because benecence and non-malef-icence rely extensively on the concept of 'healing' and 'health'. The question of how to ethically deal with placebo-effects is open. Relevance of non-ethical disciplines and aspects Given the great importance of benecence and non-malecence issues, certain non-ethical disciplinesbecome paramount in determining the range of the ethical justication of CAM. Epistemological ques- tions are inevitable and as shown on level 3 evensemantical, metaphysical/ontological and meta-eth-ical aspects have to be considered. It is not sufcientto solely rely on empirical data for it is produced, interpreted and evaluated according to establishedand accepted philosophical underpinnings (e.g. a 'disease/cure'-focus vs. an 'illness experience'-fo- cus). Such assumptions also have to be rigorouslyquestioned and examined for the purpose of deter-mining the ethical justication of CAM. An 'only ethics'-approach (such as some utili- tarian approaches, but also applied ethicsapproaches such as the standard principles ofbioethics) presuppose the epistemic justication or just ignore it. Generally utilitarianism, especially preference utilitarianism, seems to do the best workin justifying CAM since it can evade substantialquestions (e.g. the truth of a CAM position).Decisionism would evade substantial issues such as the whole discussion about epistemology andmethodology as well as the rightness of CAM isreduced to what citizens chose in a democratic system. However, the problem with both ap- proaches is exactly this evasion since they do notquestion if a CAM therapy at hand is epistemicallyjustied. Values Both biomedicine and CAM share a number of ethical and ethics-related values relevant to healing and caring: human dignity, autonomy, the value ofhealth and happiness/well-being on the individualand social level. They might also share some non-ethical values such as epistemic values (e.g. thevalues of truth and knowledge), but may maintaina different axiology. The goals, however, are verysimilar, e.g. promoting health, relieving suffering and avoiding harm (Kaptchuk and Miller, 2005; Ernst and Stone, 2004). However, there are some differences, especially in CAM positions with 'metaphysical commitment'that have a strong spiritual underpinning. In thesepositions, values that are not shared with biomed-icine can be a problematic issue (such as the valueof nature as a healing power (Kaptchuk and Miller, 2005) not being shared). Additionally, it must be stressed that sharing a value is nottantamount to promoting or realizing this valuein the same way ; values can be promoted or realized in multiple ways, and CAM positions might do thisin ways quite dierent from biomedicine.

Qualitative research of socialsciences and hermeneutical ethics might befruitful and could be organized interdisciplinarily.For gaining more insight in the legitimation dis- course, studies of sociology of knowledge could be valuable.

Notes 1. This is a content-shortened version of the original pa- per. A longer and more elaborated version can be ob- tained from the author. 2. According to the German tradition, 'science' as a general term (German: wissenschaft) refers to natural sciences, social sciences and humanities. 3. The problem with the predicate 'metaphysical' lies in at least two separate uses of the word. As a philoso- pher, 'metaphysics' is regularly conceived of as a ra- tional reflection on the formal conditions andprerequisites about our conceptions of reality, nowa- days often through analysis of language (Runggaldier and Kanzian, 1998). For a non-philosopher (andprobably for some philosophers as well), 'metaphysics'is more akin to a quasi-religious belief system, like 'New Age' esoteric, or might be a general term for all that is concerned neither with empirical nor semanti-cal issues. The dierence between a philosophical and an 'esoteric' view of metaphysics lies between meta- physics which is very detailed in regard of content anda more formal approach on metaphysics for examin- ing and grounding ontological formal-orientated assumptions orpresuppositions , as in contemporary 'analytic' philosophy. Compare, intuitively, an ap- proach to metaphysics/ontology of a philosopher likeWillard van Orman Quine and its interest in ''what there basically (categorical) is'' with a metaphysical system of, say, Deepak Chopra to see the point I amaiming at. 4. With 'metaphysical commitment' I mean a cognitive (belief, assertion) and/or emotional characteristic that a position entails for its proponents. These (spiritual)beliefs mean something to the person; they are part of the personal 'weltanschauung' - The importance of metaphysical and other philosophical underpinningsin CAM is obvious when considering the problem of 'rationality' or 'irrationality' of a practice since CAM is often called 'irrational' by its critics. CAM-practi-tioners may ''(...) respond that every therapy is ra-tional insofar as its methods of treatment are logically entailed by its fundamental premises or its assump- tions about the nature of disease.'' (Fuller, 1995, p.133; emphasis added). 5. Although it should be obvious, I would like to state clearly that all considerations about ethical justica- tion made in this paper must - in principle - alsomanage to be addressed at biomedicine and all health care related topics; if not, an unwarranted 'double standard' would be the case. While there might be some considerations which hardly can be addressed atcontemporary biomedicine, this is because it lacks the descriptive properties relevant for such consider- ations. 6. This has been labelled 'pragmatic fallacy': ''The prag- matic fallacy is committed when one argues that something is true because it works . (...).'' (Carroll, 2003). 7. See for example proponents of Ayurvedic Medicine, criticized by Meera Nanda (2006): ''(...) On the otherhand, we hear repeated claims from traditional healers and modern gurus alike that no amount of research can alter or refute the 'Eternal and AbsoluteTruths' of Ayurveda which was supposedly revealed to the Vedic seers at the very 'beginning of time.' Even AYUSH, the government agency responsiblefor scientic research, describes Ayurveda as having'originated with the origin of the universe itself.''' 8. One should not na \u00a8vely assume that positions with strong 'metaphysical commitment' would accept the dedication to 'rational enquiry' altogether. Theymight claim 'other' forms of enquiry and sources of knowledge that are privileged to rational accounts. When metaphysical positions vary in this degree, itseems to mark the end of all intersubjectivity. 9. The problem is not that we know that a given strong metaphysical position is wrong. The problem is that we can also not know that it is true and the possibility to show the truth of the position without alreadyhaving to presuppose the whole truth of the position might be levelled beyond any rational recognition. 10. Merton assumed that the ethos of science consists of four distinct concepts that bind scientic working on normative grounds: universalism ,communalism ,disin- terestedness scepticism legitimised through institutionalised values in theC OMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 343scientic system and derived from institutionalised goals and methods of science: the extension of certi-ed knowledge.
