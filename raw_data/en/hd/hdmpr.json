Naturopathy treats each person as an individual and supports the whole person to live a healthy lifestyle. The foundations of naturopathy are based on the importance of a healthy diet, clean fresh water, sunlight, exercise and stress management. Naturopathy aims to educate the person to look after their own health and the health of their family, minimizing symptoms of any illness, supporting the body's capacity to heal, and balancing the body so that illness is less likely to occur in the future. A range of therapies are used to support the person. Therapies may include nutritional medicine, diet advice, herbal medicine, homoeopathy, lifestyle advice, and tactile therapies, such as massage and acupressure. A naturopath employs a range of non-invasive techniques and these include (but are not limited to): - Herbal medicine - Herbs can support the body as a supplement. - Hydrotherapy (water therapy). For instance, the use of hot and cold compresses might be used for certain conditions to influence the flow of blood and body heat - Physical Therapies - such as massage, Bowen, acupressure, bio-puncture or mechanotherapy - Counselling Techniques - emotional problems and stress can interfere with the healing process. Counselling techniques can include stress management strategies and life coaching. "}
