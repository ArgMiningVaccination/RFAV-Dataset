Sceptical? Read their stories and judge for yourself When Ruth Owen was given the devastating news that her beloved miniature bull terrier had a deadly cancerous growth in her stomach, she prepared herself for a sad goodbye. The vet gave her dog just months to live but suggested that while chemotherapy and steroids couldn't cure the small cell lymphoma, they could buy Ruth a little more time with her pet Dorothy, then 11, which she had taken in as a rescue puppy a decade earlier. However, Ruth decided that she could not put her adored dog through the agonising side-effects of the drugs. Instead, the 54-year-old, from Newton Abbot, Devon, opted to try homeopathy in the hope of making Dorothy more comfortable during her final days. Scroll down for video Ruth Owen, pictured with miniature bull terrier Dorothy, 11, is convinced homeopathy cured her beloved pet's cancer, who lived three years longer than vets believed she would Astonishingly given the lack of scientific weight behind homeopathy's claims, Ruth found a Cambridge University-trained veterinary surgeon, Geoff Johnson, who offers only alternative therapies at his Somerset practice. While other veterinary practices have banned homeopathy on the grounds that it is ineffective \u2014 and this week a study concluded claims that animals benefit from homeopathy are based on unreliable evidence \u2014 Geoff has worked on hundreds of animals homeopathically since gaining a second degree in the subject from Oxford University 12 years ago. 'The only thing I knew about it was that it purports to do no harm, so I took Dorothy along for a consultation,' says Ruth. 'As well as having a very distended stomach, she also had terrible sickness and diarrhoea, and no energy, and I hoped homeopathy might ease her symptoms.' Following an hour-long assessment, Dorothy was prescribed a thrice-daily drop of Gadolinium arsenate, derived from metal and salt and one of around 4,000 homeopathic remedies, diluted in 100ml of water. The consultation and prescription cost \u00a3100 in total. After a week, Ruth insists, Dorothy's stomach was no longer swollen and within three weeks her symptoms had cleared and she appeared to be back to full health. She had been suffering for three months before treatment and, as it was the only change that Ruth introduced, she is convinced homeopathy cured her precious pet. Ruth continued the treatment for a further eight months, and then Dorothy continued receiving just one 2ml dose a week. Despite having been given just months to live, she remained fit and well for another three years before dying aged 14 \u2014 not of cancer, but a stroke. Ruth says: 'I believe that, thanks to homeopathy, I got three more wonderful years with Dorothy. 'They were years in which she didn't have to suffer the dreadful side-effects of steroids and chemotherapy. 'She was 14 when she passed away, due to a stroke, no doubt the result of her advanced years, but she was fit and healthy right up until the end. 'The expected lifespan for a miniature bull terrier is just 11 or 12 years, so I feel extremely fortunate that homeopathy helped Dorothy beat cancer and gave her a new lease of life.' Understandably, though, many were dubious about Dorothy's apparently miraculous recovery. 'Some people I've told have said, \"She couldn't have had cancer, it will have been a wrong diagnosis\", but it showed up on X-rays, in blood tests and biopsies,' says Ruth. She admits she didn't have Dorothy X-rayed after the homeopathy to see if the tumour in her stomach had changed size, but says: 'My message to doubters is, if homeopathy didn't cure it, where did the mass go?' However, even Ruth has been forced to admit that homeopathy carries no guarantees. She returned to Geoff Johnson when her crossbreed dog Kevin developed a skin rash last year and says: 'He tried three different treatments on him, none of which worked, so in the end I went to my regular vet who prescribed a steroid cream, which cleared the rash. 'So, obviously, homeopathy doesn't work for everything.' Vet Geoff, 53, first became interested in animal homeopathy 21 years ago after being successfully treated for hay fever by a professional homeopath, and is in no doubt that the remedy he prescribed shrank Dorothy's tumour. He explains that homeopathy is not used to cure specific conditions, but triggers an individual's body into being able to heal itself. So, the key is finding out as much about the person, or animal, as possible \u2014 taking into account temperament, medical history, sleeping and eating \u2014 before selecting a remedy for them. 'Conventional medicine has a very important role and, if my child had meningitis, I would ensure they were on a penicillin drip in a hospital in no time,' says Geoff. 'But in the case of Dorothy, and many others, there was no medical cure so we used homeopathy to help her body heal itself. 'I understand why some people question its efficacy because the mechanism is totally different to conventional medicine, but I would tell them, \"Come and look at the animals I've treated successfully.\" ' However, homeopathy is deeply controversial among Geoff's colleagues in the veterinary world. In a report published this week, scientists from the University of Kassel, in Germany, assessed studies published between 1981 and 2014 and found none of the clinical trials that claim to show effectiveness have been repeated under comparable conditions, meaning results are unproven. Devon vet Danny Chambers has drawn up a petition asking the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons to introduce rules preventing the use of homeopathy by vets. It has attracted 2,500 signatures, including those of 1,100 vets, veterinary nurses and scientists. He says: 'I have seen cases of animals who have had to be put to sleep because homeopathy has been used instead of a conventional treatment, which could have worked.' He adds: 'I've seen this with a dog who had Cushing's disease, a hormonal condition which could have been treated effectively with drugs, but the owners chose instead to use homeopathy. 'Another was a cat with hyperthyroidism, which could have easily been treated with medicine. 'Even if a vet is giving homeopathic remedies alongside conventional treatment, although it won't harm the animal, it legitimises a treatment that doesn't warrant it and owners are being charged for things that just do not work.' However, the British Association of Homeopathic Veterinary Surgeons disputes the claims that there is no proof the treatment works, and the RCVS says it would be difficult to ban vets from offering it. Most studies have concluded that there is no evidence of the medicinal effect of homeopathy, whether practised on humans or animals. Gemma Cook's (left) horse, Derby, has reiki performed by Sarah Adams (right), which keeps her calm and apparently eased stiffness in her leg A 2010 House of Commons Science and Technology Committee report stated that homeopathic remedies work no better than placebos and that the principles on which it is based are 'scientifically implausible', a view shared by England's Chief Medical Officer, Prof Dame Sally Davies. Nevertheless, more and more owners are giving their pets alternative therapies and homeopathy has many advocates, including Prince Charles, who last month revealed that he uses homeopathic remedies on his cows and sheep. Homeopathy is currently practised by some 50 qualified vets. And it's far from the only complementary therapy that owners rely on when their animals become sick. Gemma Cook's strawberry roan horse Derby has had a stiff hind left leg for years and, as physiotherapy has been unable to cure it, she turned to reiki. With its roots in Japanese culture, reiki healing is based on the theory that humans, and animals, have seven major chakras \u2014 centres of energy \u2014 in their bodies and when one or more of these becomes unbalanced, the body and mind suffer. Another owner at the stables where Gemma keeps Derby, near her home in Kent, employed a reiki healer to treat her horse for cellulitis, a bacterial infection of the soft connective tissues, in one of its hind legs, and recommended the therapy. 'Derby was very highly strung and so, as well as her physical symptoms, I thought the reiki might help calm her,' says Gemma, 34, who works in advertising sales. 'We've had quite a few falls over the 17 years I've had her, usually because she's refused to jump, which may be partly due to her stiff leg. 'But it's made us both a bit nervous and wary. Derby could be naughty, biting and pushing me out of the way too.' A month ago, reiki practitioner Sarah Adams began visiting Derby at her stables and, standing a little distance from the horse, 'allowed the energy to flow' between them. After three hour-long sessions to help rebalance her chakras, monthly follow-up appointments have been recommended, at a cost of \u00a335 each. 'I don't have to place my hands on the animal,' says Sarah. 'It's a natural healing therapy and the energy needed to rebalance the chakras flows from me to them. 'After the first session she was more flexible and mobile and less stressed, and much better still after the third.' Gemma also believes that Derby is happier and more relaxed as a result of the treatment. She says: 'When I ride her I can feel that the stiffness in her leg has eased, so we both feel a lot more relaxed. 'In fact, she felt so different beneath me that I had to ask one of the stable girls to check if she looked OK. 'She's also more laid back and doesn't get uptight when I leave her. 'Friends who are sceptical about alternative therapies look at me as if I'm crazy and say, \"Why on earth would you pay for reiki for a horse?\" 'But I want Derby to be happy, and I'm pretty open-minded, so willing to give things a try.' Emma Saville was close to the end of her tether, after consulting her vet about methods to stop her cat urinating and defecating all over the family home in Chelmsford, Essex, by the time she tried aromatherapy. Annie, a fluffy, long-haired black and white moggy, was three when Emma rescued her three years ago. She and her daughters Ava, now nine, and Neve, seven, were advised to keep Annie indoors for the first eight weeks, until she became acclimatised. Emma Saville, right, tried aromatherapy treatment from therapist Caroline Thomas, left, to stop cat Annie, pictured, urinating and defecating around her home in Essex During that time Annie used a litter tray. However, once it was time for her to venture outside, where she was expected to go to the toilet, she refused and, avoiding her tray, used carpets indoors instead. 'I took her to the vet, who said she was clearly stressed and anxious and consequently marking her territory,' recalls Emma. 'It was a huge headache for me because, with young children to protect, I was forever having to check the corners of rooms and clean up the mess Annie left.' Emma discovered that, when Annie was rescued by the RSPCA in Colchester, she had been a stray and recently given birth to a litter of kittens, who were found lying dead around her. Convinced this was at the root of Annie's distress, Emma did some online searches and came across animal aromatherapist Caroline Thomas, who charges \u00a345 for an initial consultation. Caroline explained that cats have an advanced olfactory system and are therefore very sensitive to smells. But, while aromatherapy can help, the essential oils must be heavily diluted and carefully administered to cats, as they lack an enzyme important in breaking down the oils. 'Having heard Annie's story, I decided to try her with three different oils \u2014 yarrow, which is useful in helping with emotional trauma; carrot seed, which we use for abandonment; and angelica essential, which is for traumas suffered in early life,' says Caroline. 'We believe that aromatherapy helps with stress by balancing the body and connecting to the brain's limbic system, which deals with emotions.' Caroline left the bottles \u2014 each costing \u00a315 and containing one drop of essential oil in 25ml of carrier oils \u2014 with Emma and told her to take off the lids each day and let Annie choose which ones she wanted to sniff. 'Somehow it seemed to quell her anxiety and, after a week, she stopped using our home as a toilet and happily went outside instead,' says Emma. With figures showing one of the main reasons four in ten pet insurance claims are rejected is the growing number looking to be reimbursed for treatments such as acupuncture and hydrotherapy, it seems Ruth, Gemma and Emma are far from alone in seeking alternative solutions. Vet Danny Chambers, however, continues to urge caution. 'People who use alternative medicines on their pets, instead of seeking proper veterinary advice, can unwittingly allow their animals to be sicker for longer,' he warns.
