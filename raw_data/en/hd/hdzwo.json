If you are reading this article, you are likely vaccinating your children or yourself, or you are considering it. This is an article to support parents to keep their children healthy. While this article is geared towards children, it is just as relevant and applicable for adults. Regardless of your belief system about vaccines, every adult and parent should know how to prepare for, and detoxify from, vaccines. I believe that we all want what's best for our children and for ourselves! This is simply a guide for healing and balance. A guide to prepare the body for vaccines and to detoxify the body after receiving vaccines. If you are vaccinating for any reason, consider adding a healing protocol to your plan and choices. I have used this protocol successfully with my own children, children in my practice, and have guided many friends through this process. Thus far, I have only observed success with preventing vaccine reactions and minimizing related symptoms. I will tell you this, it can't hurt, and it will very likely help a lot. I have heard from several parents that this protocol not only prevented vaccine reactions, but improved their child's overall health! This protocol was originally born out of fear. If you are reading this, you may be in that place... and that's ok. I want to reassure you that you have options and choices here, and you DO NOT have to choose a side. We are all entitled to do the absolute best that we can to care for our families and ourselves. I was scared to death for my daughter, Helena, when she was receiving her first vaccine. She was 9 years old and had never received any medication or shot of any kind. Not a tylenol, not an antibiotic... nothing. We chose to move forward with vaccines because she wanted to attend summer camp, but I had no idea how her body would react. As I have been known to do, I researched like crazy and came up with the early basis for this protocol. Since then, I have learned so much and have moved from a place of fear, to one of choice, balance and prevention. I continually support people to make their own informed choices. The core principle here is this; A healthy body can handle more than we can imagine. The reverse is true as well. An unbalanced, or un-well, body often cannot handle challenges without resulting in illness. If you or your child are healthy, thriving, have low toxicity, a healthy immune system, and a healthy gut, then there is an excellent chance that vaccines will not result in reaction, injury, or illness. If not, the opposite is also true. This is the basis for prevention. It is well accepted that vaccines are contraindicated (this means you should not do it!) for individuals with severely compromised immune systems, for children with cold or flu, and for children with certain neurological diagnosis. Our children's collective wellness in this country is steadily on the decline. Children (and adults) are increasingly exposed to processed foods, toxins, increased vaccine schedules, less fresh air, less activity, and more screens. Notice I toss vaccines in with a list of factors that affect overall wellness. Like food or activity, there are remedies to regain health and balance. We also know that the some ingredients listed in vaccines are carcinogenic and neurotoxic. You can check out vaccine ingredients from the CDC website Vaccine Prevention and Detox Protocol The protocol is based on these basic healing principles: 1. Nourish deeply with food, herbs, and supplements 2. Detoxify the tissues of the body 3. Decrease systemic inflammation I'll let you in on a secret. This is a great start for healing no matter what you are dealing with! Use your discretion and do your research for age appropriateness. For nursing infants, some of these recommendations should be followed by the mother. Prevention: 2 weeks before (4 weeks if needed for an unwell individual) Prevention: 1 week before After Vaccination: For current or past vaccines There's the Vaccine Preparation and Detox Protocol in a nutshell! Every BODY is different. Use your discretion in applying theses recommendations for your children or yourself. Happy Healing! Important Notes and Additions: If you are interested in learning about homeopathic prophylaxis against world disease, I highly recommend You may notice your child (or yourself) being extra tired or grumpy while you are detoxing. This is a good thing, it means it is working! I have heard from family members and friends that If you need guidance for this process, there are many caring practitioners, including myself, that are qualified to support you.

The human body has the innate power to heal itself. Without this power to self-heal, even the most advanced medications and procedures would ultimately fail. The role of the herbalist in this healing process is to consider the client as a whole person and to consult with the client concerning changes in lifestyle, diet, and supplementation of herbs and/or vitamins to foster an increased state of balance and health. Thus maximizing the body's self-healing capabilities.

Thank you for all the very detailed information. I am trying to prep my 4 year old for vaccination. My son was vaccine injured years ago and we are looking into detoxing him. The one thing I am concerned and nervous about is my 4 year old isn't supposed to have any ibuprofen or fish oil or any other medication or herbs that can thin the blood because she has a bleeding disorder called Von willebrands. She hasn't received a single vaccine and I am so worried. Do you know what part of this protocol we should steer clear of pertaining to her bleeding disorder?
