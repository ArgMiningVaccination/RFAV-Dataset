DOI 10.1016/j.cell.2012.03.001 Cardiovascular disease encompasses a range of conditions extending from myocardial infarction to congenital heart disease, most of which are heritable. Enormous effort has been investedin understanding the genes and specic DNA sequence variants that are responsible for this heritability. Here, we review the lessons learned for monogenic and common, complex forms of cardiovascular disease. We also discuss key challenges that remain for gene discovery and for moving from genomic localization to mechanistic insights, with an emphasis on the impact of next-generation sequencing and the use of pluripotent human cells to understand the mechanism by which genetic variation contributes to disease. Introduction Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading health problem,affecting more than 80,000,000 individuals in the United States alone. CVD encompasses a broad range of disorders, including diseases of the vasculature, diseases of the myocardium,diseases of the heart's electrical circuit, and congenital heart disease ( Roger et al., 2012 ). For nearly all of these disor- ders, inherited DNA sequence variants play a role in conferring risk for disease. For example, in the general population, a historyof premature atherosclerotic CVD in a parent confers /C243.0-fold increase in CVD risk to offspring ( Lloyd-Jones et al., 2004 ). The precise magnitude of the role of inheritance, however, variesby disease and by other factors such as age of disease onset and subtype of disease. Over the past century, a key goal of biomedical research has been to correlate genotype with phenotype, i.e., to identifythe specic genes and DNA sequence variants responsible for trait variation in humans. What is the principal reason topursue this goal? Naturally occurring genetic variation has the unique potential to reveal causal biologic mechanisms in humans . This is particularly important, as some diseases like myocardial infarction (MI) are poorly modeled in nonhumanspecies. In this Review, we consider the approaches used to discover genes for human CVD and the lessons learned from the studyof Mendelian and of common, complex forms of CVD, and we take a look forward at research driven by next generation techniques, including sequencing and modeling human geneticdisease in cells. Approaches to Discover Genes for CVD To discover genes for CVD and its risk factors in humans, two major approaches\u2014linkage analysis and genetic association\u2014have been utilized. The choice of approach has depended on the pattern of segregation, whether consistent with the ratiosdescribed by Mendel or more complex. Some forms of CVD exhibit a simple pattern of inheritance suggestive of a singlecausal gene that confers a large effect on phenotype. For many of these Mendelian forms of CVD, direct DNA sequencing and/or linkage analysis have successfully yielded the causalgene and mutation. In 1985, Lehrman and colleagues directly sequenced the low-density lipoprotein receptor homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and uncovered a 5 kilobase deletion that eliminated several exons,representing the rst demonstration of a mutation for Mendelian CVD ( Lehrman et al., 1985 ). In 1989, linkage analysis was used to localize the chromosomal position of a causal gene for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and in the subsequent year, mutations in the beta cardiac myosin heavy chain were discov- ered as causal for the phenotype ( Geisterfer-Lowrance et al., 1990; Jarcho et al., 1989 ). Other prominent examples in the CVD eld include long QT syndrome, severe hypercholesterol-emia, a Mendelian family with early coronary artery disease,Mendelian forms of hypertension, Marfan's syndrome, and several forms of congenital heart disease, including septal defects and valve defects ( Abifadel et al., et 1989; Tartaglia et al., 2001 ). However, most CVD traits, such as MI or concentrations of plasma LDL cholesterol, show complex inheritance, suggestiveof an interplay between multiple genes and nongenetic factors.Mapping gene loci associated with complex traits requires substantial levels of information and analysis, but since 2007, approaches to accomplish this goal have matured, andgenetic mapping for complex traits in humans has becomea reality. The intellectual foundations that enabled a systematic genome-wide screen of common variants (termed genome- wide association study [GWAS]) and results from this approach 1242 Cell148, March 16, 2012 \u00aa2012 Elsevier Inc.were recently reviewed Altshuler et al., 2008; O'Donnell and Nabel, 2011 ). The tools and methods included catalogs of polymorphisms, techniques to genotype these DNA sequence variants, and the analytical framework to distinguish trueassociation signal from false positives. The initial focus has been on utilizing common DNA sequence variants (variants with allele frequency > 1:20) as a discovery tool, largelybecause it was practical to do so; recent advances in DNAsequencing and genotyping technology will allow interrogation of less frequent variants and will be considered below. The National Human Genome Research Institute hosts a catalogof published GWAS results, and as of January 14, 2012, the catalog includes 1,143 publications and 5,585 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with association evidence at p < 10 /C05 (Hindorff et al., 2009 ). What have we learned from these gene discovery efforts? Below, we discuss lessons that have emerged from geno-type-to-phenotype correlation studies for Mendelian diseases,followed by lessons from studies of common, complex diseases. Lessons Learned from the Study of Mendelian Forms of CVDRare Variants Lead to Broadly Relevant Insights Because Mendelian diseases are rare in the population, there was initial skepticism about whether the genes and mechanismsthat cause these diseases would inform our understandingof common forms of CVD. Linkage studies involve identifying and recruiting families with unique, often severe phenotypes, isolating a chromosomal segment that tracks with diseasestatus in the family, and then pinpointing the causal gene and mutation in the linked segment. For a range of conditions, the genes identied by these linkage studies have transformedour understanding of CVD. Selected examples of Mendelian diseases, the responsible genes, and the gleaned biological and clinical insights are detailed in Table 1 . Of particular signicance is monogenic severe hypercholesterolemia, for which the six responsible genes have led to fundamental new biological concepts and have supported the development ofnew therapies.Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Can Be Complex Even in Monogenic Disorders Although there are cases in which single gene mutations lead tostraightforward genotype-phenotype associations, other more complex relationships exist as well. This complexity can arise from three distinct genetic phenomena: pleiotropy, penetrance,and expressivity. Sometimes, mutations in a single gene can influence multiple phenotypic traits (i.e., pleiotropy). In 1995, Wang, Keating, and colleagues identied the asubunit of the type V voltage-gated sodium channel ( SCN5A ) as the cause of inherited long QT syndrome type 3 ( Wang et al., 1995 ). Since then, mutations in the same gene have been demonstrated tocause Brugada syndrome (right precordial ST-segment eleva-tion and increased disease, and dilated cardiomyopathy et al., 1998; McNair et al., 2004; Schott et al., 1999 ). This range of disease phenotypes may reflect the underlying functionalityof the channel.Among carriers of a Mendelian mutation in a given family, some may exhibit the condition and others may not. Penetrancerefers to the proportion of individuals with a given genotype who exhibit the phenotype associated with the genotype. Inmany Mendelian cardiovascular conditions inherited in an autosomal-dominant manner, there is evidence for incomplete penetrance. For example, Hobbs and colleagues reported that,in a pedigree familial hypercholesterolemia due to a pointmutation in LDLR , only 12 out of 18 heterozygotes had high LDL cholesterol (>95th percentile), whereas some of the remain-ing 6 had LDL cholesterol as low as 28th percentile for thepopulation ( Hobbs et al., 1989 ). The lack of a high-cholesterol phenotype given the same genotype may be due to modiergenes or environmental influences. Individuals with the same Mendelian genotype can also show different degrees of the same phenotype. Expressivity is thedegree to which trait expression differs among individuals.Marfan's syndrome is a multisystem Mendelian disorder thatcan include a range of signs and symptoms involving the skeletal system (pectus excavatum, increased arm span to height ratio, craniofacial alterations), ocular system (eye lens dislocation, flatcornea), and cardiovascular system (aortic aneurysm, dissection of the ascending aorta, mitral valve prolapse), among others (Canadas et al., 2010 ). Dietz and colleagues identied mutations in the FBN1 gene encoding the extracellular matrix protein brillin 1 as responsible for Marfan's syndrome ( Dietz et al., 1991 ). When mutation the brillin 1 ( FBN1 ) gene causes Marfan's syndrome in a family, carriers of the same mutation can display variable clinical manifestations ( Faivre et al., 2007 ). Pleiotropy, penetrance, expressivity, and nongenetic factors conspire to ensure that, even in a single gene disorder, genotype does not ''equal'' a specic phenotype. This complexity has several consequences. First, gene discovery is more difcult, as genotype may not segregate perfectly with phenotype,thereby reducing the power of linkage. Second, there is intense interest in identifying modiers\u2014genetic or environmental\u2014that may modulate the relationship between genotype and pheno-type. Finally, because of this complexity, in many Mendelian diseases, it has been difcult to develop genotype-specic prognostic or treatment recommendations.The Long Road from Genotype to Mechanismto Treatment For Marfan's syndrome, the path from the discovery of FBN1 as the causal gene to a breakthrough in the molecular under- standing of the disease has spanned more than two decades. Historically, Marfan's syndrome had been viewed as a structural disease due to a defect in elastic bers ( Lindsay and Dietz, 2011 ). The identication of mutations in an extracellular matrix protein seemed to conrm this view. However, more recent studies suggest that microbrils normally bind the large latent complexof the cytokine transforming growth factor b(TGF- b) and that failure of this event to occur results in increased TGF- bactivation and signaling. Now, investigators are exploring the hypothesisthat blocking TGF- bsignaling will ameliorate the growth of aortic aneurysms in Marfan's syndrome. For further examples of therapeutic approaches derived from the study of Mendelian disorders, we refer the reader to a recent review on this topic(Dietz, 2010 ).

In other words, genetic heterogeneity from variants across the frequency spectrummay be the rule. Consider the example of plasma triglycerides, a phenotype that marks triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, including very low-density lipoprotein particles, chylomicrons, andremnant products of their metabolism. Roughly 50% of the inter- individual variability in plasma triglycerides is estimated to beon the basis of DNA sequence variants. Johansen, Hegele, and colleagues studied individuals from the extremes of the plasmatriglyceride distribution (438 individuals with high triglycerides [mean triglycerides = 14.2 mmol/l] and 327 individuals with low triglycerides [mean triglycerides = 1.2 mmol/l]) ( Johansen et al., 2010 ) using both GWAS and resequencing of selected genes. In the GWAS, common variants at seven loci were associated with plasma triglycerides, and in the resequencing study, there was an excess of rare, nonsynonymous variants across fourgenes in individuals with high triglycerides when compared with those with low triglycerides. A comprehensive logistic regression model including clinical variables and both commonand rare genetic variants explained 42% of total variation in hypertriglyceridemia diagnosis: clinical variables explainedTable 1.

The geneticarchitecture for triglycerides in the population appears to be that of a mosaic comprised of large-effect variants rare in frequency, small-effect variants common in frequency, andenvironmental influences. More generally, the concept of a mosaic model is supported by the fact that, for many cardiovascular traits and diseases,there is strong overlap between the genes mapped usingGWAS and those identied earlier through Mendelian families. Nineteen genes have been identied as monogenic causes of extremely low or high levels of LDL cholesterol, high-density lipo-protein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides; loci harboring 16 of these genes were also mapped using GWAS ( Figure 1 )(Teslovich et al., 2010 ). Rare in FBN1 cause the thoracic in the introns of FBN1 are the top association result in a GWAS for spontaneous, nonsyndromic thoracic aortic aneurysm and common SNPs in these vegenes are associated with QT interval measured on electrocar-diograms in the population ( Newton-Cheh et al., 2009 ). New Biological Insights from GWAS GenesPlasma lipids, platelets, and sickle cell disease represent threeelds in which there has been progress toward new biology based on GWAS. GWAS for plasma LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides have evaluated > 100,000 partic-ipants and have mapped 95 distinct loci associated with at least one of these traits at a stringent statistical threshold (p < 5 310 /C08)(Kathiresan et al., 2008, 2009b; Pollin et al., 2008; Teslovich et al., 2010; Willer et al., 2008 ). Approximately one-third of the loci harbored genes previously appreciated to play a role in lipoprotein metabolism, including ve development by several pharmaceutical companies) ( Figure 1 ). Of note, the proportion of overall phenotypic variance ex- plained by a genetic variant may have little correlation with theultimate therapeutic or biological value of the gene mappedby the variant. Phenotypic variance explained by a variant isa function of two key parameters: allele frequency and effect size. For Mendelian diseases, the causal variants typically confer large effects but explain a small proportion of trait vari-ance due to their rare frequencies. Variants from GWAS are common but explain a small proportion of trait variance due to modest effects. Nevertheless, variants that explain a smallproportion of phenotypic variance may provide substantial bio-logical or therapeutic insights. This has been highlighted for Mendelian genes in Table 1 . Two examples for common SNPs include variants in the of et al., 2010 ). These SNPs confer a small effect on plasma LDL cholesterol at 3 mg/dl and 2 mg/dl, respectively; however, targeting of these genes with statins or ezetimibe, respectively,has a much more dramatic effect on LDL cholesterol. And to date, there have been no rare, large-effect Mendelian mutations described in HMGCR , presumably because such mutations are highly deleterious and not tolerated. Thus, some diseasegenes may only be discoverable through common, small-effect variants. Approximately two-thirds of the 95 loci discovered for plasma lipid traits harbored genes not previously appreciated to playa role in the biology of lipoproteins. Several genes at the ''novel'' loci have now been manipulated in the mouse, and this manipu-lation led to plasma lipid changes analogous to that suggested by the human genetics. An example is the 8q24 locus containing the tribbles homolog et ). DNA sequence variants downstream of the TRIB1 gene were initially associated with plasma lipids, with the minor allele havingassociation with lower plasma triglycerides, lower plasma LDLcholesterol, and higher plasma HDL cholesterol. Given thispattern of plasma lipid changes, minor allele carriers would be expected to have lower risk for coronary heart disease, and several groups have conrmed this expectation ( Varbo et al., 2011 ). Targeted deletion of Trib1 in mice led to elevated levels of plasma triglycerides and cholesterol, whereas liver-specicoverexpression of Trib1 reduced levels of plasma triglycerides and cholesterol. SORT1 ,GALNT2 ,PPP1R3B , and TTC39B are four other genes implicated in lipoprotein regulation by GWAS Figure 1. Overlap of Genetic a plau- sible biologic candidate in the locus or to the lead single-nucleotide poly- morphism (SNP). Note that, for most GWAS loci, the causal gene is not yet proven. Of 19 genespreviously implicated in Mendelian lipid disorders, 16 of the genes underlying these Mendelian disorders lie within 100 kilobases of one of the leadSNPs mapped by GWAS, including nine that lie within 10 kilobases of the nearest lead SNP (Te- slovich et al., 2010 ). Cell148, March 16, 2012 \u00aa2012 Elsevier Inc. 1245and are conrmed in a similar manner using mouse models (Musunuru et al., 2010b; Teslovich et al., 2010 ). plasma lipids, well-powered GWAS and experi- mental follow-up in cells and model organisms have identiednew regulators of thrombopoiesis and/or erythropoiesis. A GWAS study for blood platelet count and volume mapped 58 loci ( Gieger et al., 2011 ). For genes at 11 mapped loci, gene silencing in either the zebrash or Drosophila led to alterations in thrombopoiesis and/or erythropoiesis. The precise mecha- nisms by which these genes alter blood cell formation remain to be dened through additional studies; however, we nowhave a plethora of new genes for experimental follow-up, all with a foundation of relevance to human phenotypes. The identication of BCL11A as a transcriptional regulator of fetal hemoglobin synthesis and as a potential therapeutic targetfor sickle cell disease represents more biology learned from GWAS. Sickle cell disease results from the substitution of a valinefor glutamic acid in the b-globin chain of adult hemoglobin. The mutated hemoglobin (HbS) undergoes conformational change and polymerization upon deoxygenation, leading to hemolysis, red blood cell deformation, and pathology due to microvascularocclusion. Hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) decreases the severity of sickle cell disease, and the level of HbF in adults is inherited as a quantitative trait. As a result, induc-tion of HbF in adults has been a long-standing goal of therapies for sickle cell disease. In 2007, GWAS for the HbF phenotype revealed a single strong locus, with sequence variants in theintron of a transcription factor, B cell CLL/lymphoma 11A (BCL11A )(Menzel et al., 2007 ). A series of elegant studies led by Orkin and colleagues has now established that BCL11A represses the transcription of HbF expression in erythroid cells(Sankaran et al., 2008, 2009; Xu et al., 2010 ) and demonstrated that inactivation of BCL11A in a mouse model of sickle celldisease leads to pancellular induction of HbF and correctedthe hematologic and pathologic defects of the disease ( Xu et al., 2011 ). Despite these successes, for the vast majority of mapped loci, it has been a challenge to move from genomic localization to biologic mechanism. Why? First, as discussed earlier in the context of discovery of Mendelian disease genes, inferringnew biology from human genetics takes time, and only about5 years have elapsed since the initial GWAS publications. Second, gene mapping and experimental follow-up require unique skill sets and expertise. In the examples highlightedabove, collaborations between experimentalists and re- searchers focused on human genetics have been crucial to making progress, yet skepticism regarding the validity and valueof discoveries made from GWAS may have dampened the enthusiasm for such collaborations ( McClellan and King, 2010 ). Third, genetic mapping by association gives us gene regions and not necessarily specic causal variants or causal genes.For each SNP and locus mapped by GWAS, we can generally conclude that, within /C24100,000 bases of the locus, there exists a causal gene. Ideally, at each discovered locus, weneed to understand: (1) the causal variant, (2) the causal gene, (3) the mechanism by which the variant affects the gene, and (4) the mechanism by which the gene affects the phenotype.At the 1p13 locus for LDL cholesterol and MI, ne-mapping,resequencing, and manipulation of positional candidate genesin cell culture and model organisms have addressed these key questions ( Musunuru et al., 2010b ). However, at most loci, the answers remain a mystery. Several features of genetic mapping using common variants have contributed to the difculties. Local correlation (linkage disequilibrium) and weak effect size of common variants havemade it difcult to identify causal variants. Mapped SNP variantshave weak or modest effect (odds ratios of 1.05 to 1.40 for a dichotomous trait and < 1% of variance explained for contin- uous traits), and these weak effects mean that, in order to statis-tically distinguish between two correlated variants, the sample sizes need to be inordinately large. Nearly all of the mapped SNP variants are noncoding, and our ability to interpret the non-coding portion of the genome remains limited. Mechanisms by which a noncoding variant may affect a nearby gene include, among others, affecting a transcription factor or microRNA-binding site and regulating the local chromatin state. In only a few instances has there been direct demonstration that a specic noncoding GWAS SNP affects the relevant genethrough mechanisms ( Musunuru et al., 2010b ). The example of chromosome 9p21 and risk for MI exemplies the challenge. In 2007, several independent GWASs identied SNPs on chromosome 9p21 as associated with MI or coronaryartery disease, with /C2450% of the population carrying a risk allele and each copy of the risk allele conferring /C2429% increase in risk for MI/coronary artery disease Helgadottir et al., 2007; McPherson et al., 2007; Samani et al., 2007 ). The most strongly associated SNPs were noncoding and > 100 kilobases down-stream Resequencing and ne- mapping studies in the gene region have identied a set ofSNPs with indistinguishable statistical evidence, but not one causal variant ( Shea et al., 2011 ). By what mechanism does the risk allele alter the relevant gene at the locus, and what is the gene that is responsible for atherosclerosis susceptibility? Answers to these two questions have been particularly elusive. Several mechanisms by which the noncoding variant mightimpact phenotype have been explored, including alteration ofa noncoding RNA in the region (e.g., antisense noncoding RNA in the INK4 locus [ ANRIL ]) and disruption of the binding of a transcription factor, as observed with STAT1 ( Harismendy et al., 2011; Holdt and Teupser, No denitive answers have emerged. Finally, a noncoding gene region homologous to the human-associated interval on 9p21 was deleted in mice,and this targeted deletion led to near absence of CDKN2A and CDKN2B expression in several tissues, increased rate of tumors, and increased proliferation of aortic smooth muscle cells ( Visel et al., 2010 ). However, these mice did not develop increased atherosclerosis on a diet rich in fat and cholesterol. For the9p21 locus, the path from genomic localization to functionalinsights has not been straightforward, likely due to our limitedability at present to interpret the noncoding portions of the human genome. However, as recently reviewed ( Raychaudhuri, 2011 ), integration GWAS ndings that March 16, 2012 \u00aa2012 Elsevier Inc.the transcript level of a gene) and genome-wide maps of chromatin state dynamics may improve our ability to interpret GWAS ndings and understand how noncoding variation regu- lates genes Ernst et al., 2011; Schadt et al., 2008 ). Gene Variants May Distinguish Causal from Noncausal Biomarkers Hypotheses concerning etiologic agents for complex diseaseshave often initially come from observational epidemiology. In1961, in a paper entitled ''Factors of Risk in the Development of Coronary Heart Disease,'' Dr. William Kannel and colleagues at the Framingham Heart Study established an association ofplasma total cholesterol with future risk for coronary heart disease ( Kannel et al., 1961 ). Since then, hundreds of soluble biomarkers have similarly been associated with risk for coronary artery disease. How many of these biomarkers directly cause coronary artery disease, and how many simply reflect other causal processes? And why is this question important? Bothcausal and noncausal biomarkers may be helpful in terms ofpredicting risk for future disease. However, only a causal biomarker may be appropriate as a target of therapy. The ulti- mate proof of causality in humans is a randomized controlled trialtesting whether a treatment that alters the biomarker will affect disease risk. However, as clinical trials are expensive and time- consuming, it would be helpful to have evidence in humans priorto engaging in a clinical trial. In a technique termed Mendelian randomization, DNA variants are used to address the question of whether an epidemiologicalassociation between a risk factor and disease reflects a causal influence of the former on the latter ( Davey Smith and Ebrahim, 2003; Gray and Wheatley, 1991; Katan, 1986 ). In principle, if a DNA variant is known to directly affect an intermediate pheno- type (e.g., a variant in the promoter of a gene encoding a biomarker, affecting its expression) and the intermediate pheno- type truly contributes to the disease, then the DNA variantshould be associated with the disease to the extent predicted by: (1) the size of the effect of the variant on the phenotype and (2) the size of the effect of the phenotype on the disease(Musunuru and Kathiresan, 2010 ). If in an adequately powered sample, the predicted association between the variant anddisease was not observed, it would argue against a purely causalrole for the intermediate phenotype in the pathogenesis of thedisease. The study design is akin to a prospective randomized clinical trial in that the randomization for each individual occurs at the moment of conception\u2014genotypes of DNA variants arerandomly ''assigned'' to gametes during meiosis, a process that should be impervious to the typical confounders observed in observational epidemiological studies. For example, a parent'sdisease status or socioeconomic status should not affect which of the parent's two alleles at a given SNP is passed to a child, with each allele having an equal (50%) chance of being trans-mitted via the gamete to the zygote. Thus, Mendelian randomiza- by reverse causation. Mendelian randomization has potential shortcomings, including:(1) the technique is only as reliable as the robustness of theestimates of the effect sizes of the variant on the phenotype and of the phenotype on disease and (2) it assumes that the DNA variant does not influence the disease by means otherthan the intermediate phenotype being studied (pleiotropy),which may not be true. Nevertheless, Mendelian randomizationhas the potential to be as informative as a traditional randomized clinical trial. Several Mendelian randomization studies have conrmed a causal relationship between LDL cholesterol and coronaryartery disease. Nonsense variants in the PCSK9 gene that signif- icantly reduce plasma LDL cholesterol concentrations were observed to be associated with reduced incidence of coronaryartery disease in an African American cohort ( Cohen et al., 2006 ). Similarly, in European Americans, a common missense variant in PCSK9 associated with lower LDL cholesterol levels was also found to be associated with lower risk of MI. These observations suggested that lower LDL cholesterol is sufcient to provide protection against coronary artery disease. Similarto LDL cholesterol, several recent genetic studies have con- rmed prior observations that plasma lipoprotein(a) causally relates to coronary artery disease ( Clarke et al., 2009; Kamstrup et al., 2009 ). Unlike the results with plasma LDL cholesterol concentrations and plasma lipoprotein(a), three recent, large Mendelianrandomization studies of C-reactive protein gene ( CRP ) variants that affect plasma CRP concentrations, performed in thousands of individuals, did not show an association between these vari- ants and ischemic vascular disease or coronary artery disease(Elliott et al., 2009; Wensley et al., 2011; Zacho et al., 2008 ). It is unlikely that these studies were confounded or affected bypleiotropy, as the tested variants were within the CRP gene itself rather than being in other loci that might secondarily affect CRP levels. Although these studies cannot denitively rule out a causal role of CRP in cardiovascular disease, they stronglysuggest that high CRP levels are indirectly rather than directlyrelated to coronary artery disease. A parallel line of genetic evidence also casts doubt on the notion that inflammatory biomarkers such as CRP are criticalmediators of MI and coronary artery disease. Of 33 loci most highly associated with MI and coronary artery disease ( Table 2 ), nine are related to plasma LDL cholesterol or lipoprotein(a), arguing for a strong causal relationship between LDL (or a modi- ed LDL particle such as lipoprotein(a)) and disease ( Schunkert et al., 2011 ). None of the other 24 loci are clearly related to inflammation. Overall, with the recent explosion in our ability to measure both soluble biomarkers (including metabolites and proteins) and genetic variation, Mendelian randomization will likely be an increasingly utilized approach to distinguish causalbiomarkers from noncausal ones. Next Generation of Approaches Massively Parallel Sequencing as a Discovery Tool As described above, considerable progress has been made in correlating genotype to phenotype for both Mendelian and common, complex diseases over the past several decades. Over the next decade, we are in a unique position to ''nish the job.'' For Mendelian diseases, the goal is nothing short ofattempting to solve all Mendelian diseases not yet mapped. For common, complex diseases, the goal is to extend the range of genetic variation evaluated from common (>1:20 frequency)to low-frequency (1:1,000-1:20 frequency) and very rare (<1:1,000 frequency).

Next-generation sequencing platforms have markedly decreased the cost of DNA sequencing whencompared with Sanger sequencing. Hybridization approacheshave enabled selection of the portion of the genome that is protein coding (roughly 1% of the 3.2 billion bases), the so-called ''exome.'' Sequencing just the exome (rather than the entiregenome) is well justied in the search for genetic causes of rare inherited disorders ( Ng et al., 2010 ). This is because the majority of alleles that are responsible for Mendelian disorders disrupt protein-coding sequence, and a large fraction of rare missense mutations in the human genome are predicted to be deleterious ( Kryukov et al., past three years, whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing have been successfully utilized to identify new genes for several Mendelian forms of CVD. Most studies havesequenced the exomes of one or a few individuals affected with the disorder. Variants seen in these individuals are typically compared with those from reference individuals (unaffectedindividuals who are family members or unrelated). Variants that are shared by affected individuals and are not present in the unaffected population are considered causal candidates. Withthis strategy, investigators identied ANGPTL3 mutations as a cause of familial combined hypolipidemia, arterial KLHL3 orCUL3 et 2012; Choi et al., 2011; et al., 2010a; Norton et al., 2011; St Hilaireet al., 2011 ). The discovery of KLHL3 as a cause of pseudohypoaldosteron- ism type II, a Mendelian form of hypertension, is an elegantexample of the value of exome sequencing ( Boyden et al., 2012 ). The gene was identied by directly sequencing theexomes of 11 unrelated index cases with pseudohypoaldoster- onism type II and contrasting with exome sequences from 699 population-based, unrelated controls without hypertension.Of 22 case chromosomes, 5 harbored a rare, protein-alteringmutation in KLHL3 , whereas only 2 of 1,398 control chromo- somes did so, leading to a low probability that this observationwas due to chance (p = 1 310 /C08). Such successes have raised expectations for the exome sequencing approach. However, the true yield of exome sequencing in solving Mendelian disorders is difcult to know at present, as negativeresults have not been routinely reported ( Bamshad et al., 2011 ). It can be difcult to arrive at a single causal mutation after exome sequencing due to the following reasons. First, the causalvariant may not be protein coding. Second, the causal variantmay be protein coding, but the relevant gene may not be successfully captured and sequenced. Approximately 5%- 10% of all exons may be poorly sequenced due to genomicfeatures such as high GC content. Third, if the causal mutation is not fully penetrant, it will be present in individuals who are both phenotypically affected and unaffected and thus may be''ltered'' out. Fourth, the segregation of a phenotype in a family may be due to nongenetic factors rather than a single gene of large effect. This problem is particularly true for CVD conditionsthat are common in the population like MI and atrial brillation. If one observes a multigeneration family in which multiple indi- viduals are affected with MI, is this pattern due to a new Mende-lian gene or poor lifestyle habits shared by the family? Fifth, incontrast to single-nucleotide substitutions, methods for calling small insertion-deletions and copy number changes from short-read sequence data are in need of improvement. If thecausal mutation is a one or two base-pair insertion or deletion, it might be overlooked. Finally, exome sequencing and ltering are more efcient at reducing the number of candidate causalmutations for recessive rather than dominant disorders. After exome sequencing and ltering ADAMTS7 rs216172 1.65 (1.44-1.90) c6orf105 (Wang et 2011) March 16, 2012 \u00aa2012 Elsevier Inc. 1249condition, the number of mutations compatible with causing disease can be large. Next-Generation Sequencing and Common, Complex DiseaseWhat about exome or whole-genome sequencing to identify rare variants that confer a large effect on common, complex traits and diseases? The optimal study design for complex traits willdepend on the frequency of the genetic variant(s) that are thesource of the association signal. Though the term ''rare'' is used in the literature to refer to variants less than 1:20 frequency, we nd it useful to distinguish between two types of ''rare'' vari-ants, those that range in frequency from 1:1,000 to 1:20 and are denoted as ''low-frequency'' and those that are < 1:1,000 frequency and are denoted as ''very rare'' ( Figure 2 ). This cate- gorical distinction is important because the approach to discover and replicate the two signals can differ. For low-frequency variants, it is now possible to catalog nearly all coding variants segregating in a population at afrequency of 1:1,000 or greater, directly genotype these vari- ants, and test for association with disease ( Figure 2 A). For example, data from 12,000 human exome sequences havebeen mined, and all coding sites where the alternate allele is seen at least three times (twice for nonsense and splice) and in two separate studies have been cataloged. Investigatorshave designed a custom low cost. This genotyping array will allow for comprehensive testing of low-frequency coding variants for association with cardiovascular traits and diseases.In contrast, a signal emerging from a burden of very rare vari- ants can best be discovered by sequencing and can often onlybe replicated by sequencing ( Figure 2 B). The promise and challenges of this approach are evident in the candidate gene sequencing studies completed over the past few years. In seminal work, Cohen, Hobbs, and colleagues tested the hypoth- esis that rare, coding variation in candidate genes contributes toplasma HDL cholesterol variation in the population ( Cohen et al., 2004 ). Three genes that cause Mendelian forms of low HDL ( ABCA1 ,APOA1 LCAT ) were ascertained from the lowest 5th percentile(mean, 31 mg/dl) and in 128 individuals from the highest 95th percentile of the HDL cholesterol distribution (mean, 91 mg/dl) in a population-based cohort study. The investigators aggre-gated rare variants that met three criteria: (1) present within a gene, (2) changed amino acid, and (3) exclusively present in either the low or high group. Twenty such rare alleles were foundin the low group, and two such rare alleles were found in thehigh group (Fisher's exact, p = 0.00006). This observation was replicated in an independent study, and additionally, cells from mutation carriers had reduced cholesterol efflux rates, a keyfunction of ABCA1. This study established that rare nonsynony- mous mutations in ABCA1 with large phenotypic effects contribute to low HDL cholesterol in the population. The challenge now is to utilize sequencing to enable de novo discovery of new genes that contribute to complex traits. It has become practical to extend the experiment describedabove from the sequencing of three genes to /C2420,000 genes. Exomes can be rapidly sequenced, and single-nucleotidesubstitutions can be accurately called; however, will suchsequencing for complex traits readily yield new discoveries?The key barriers at present are statistical. DNA sequence vari- ants that are very rare (e.g., a mutation seen in a single person or a singleton) cannot be tested individually for associationwith phenotype. Instead, they need to be aggregated with similar rare variants to be tested collectively for association with phenotype ( Figure 2 B). This requirement immediately brings forward several ques- tions. Do we only aggregate variants within a single gene, orshould it be extended to collections of genes in a pathway? Dowe only group variants of a certain annotation\u2014nonsynony-mous, nonsense, synonymous, splice site, etc.? Should we impose a frequency threshold to dene ''rare'' (i.e., only aggre- gate variants that are less than 1% frequency), and if so, whatshould this frequency threshold be? The answers to many of these questions are in development. We refer the reader to several recent publications that address these issues ( Li and Leal, 2008; Madsen and Browning, al., 2011; Price et al., 2010 ). Another key question is statistical power. What sample size will be required to identify a new disease gene based on a burdenof rare coding mutations? An early computer simulation study conducted by Kryukov, Sunyaev, and colleagues suggestedthat 10,000 individuals (5,000 drawn from the lowest 5th percen-tile and 5,000 above the 95th percentile) will be needed to discover another gene with a mutation burden similar to ABCA1 (Kryukov et al., 2009 ). The principal reason for this large sample size is the stringent statistical threshold that needs to be Figure 2. Association Signals Arising from Rare Variants (A and B) Each line represents DNA sequence from a different individual, and each circle represents a DNA sequence variant. Each color denotes a DNA sequence variant allele at a different nucleotide site.(A)''Low-frequency'' variants can be dened as variants in frequency between 1:1000 and 1:20. Each variant can be assayed typically by genotyping andtested for association individually using single marker tests of association. (B) ''Very Rare'' variants can be dened as variants with frequency less than 1:1,000, and often the variant may be seen only in a single person (i.e.,a singleton). Variants in this frequency range need to be grouped together and tested in aggregate. Association signals from a burden of such very rare variants are typically best validated using resequencing of the same genomicinterval in additional individuals. Figure adapted from Manolio et al. (2009) . 1250 Cell148, March 16, 2012 \u00aa2012 Elsevier Inc.imposed when testing 20,000 genes. A rst approximation of the appropriate statistical threshold would be Bonferroni correctionfor all of the genes sequenced (p = 2.5 310 /C06). Our extrapolation of effect sizes and frequencies from published studies shows (Figure 3 ) that thousands of individuals are required to reach acceptable statistical power. Statistical power would improve dramatically if we were able to distinguish rare mutations that affected protein function from those that did not. The bulk of discovered rare mutationsare missense. Of all missense, it is estimated that /C241/5 are as deleterious as nonsense mutations, /C241/2 are mildly deleterious, and/C241/4 do not affect protein function ( Kryukov et al., 2007 ). If one restricted mutation counts to only functional mutations, noise would be removed ( MacArthur et al., 2012 ). At present, functional consequence of variants can be predicted based on comparative sequence analysis and protein structure analysis.Several software tools are available, and the accuracy of these methods remains a subject of debate ( Sunyaev et al., 2001 ). An alternative method is experimental evaluation of whether a given mutation is functional. Such experimental evaluation ispossible for genes with known function and where that function can be readily evaluated with moderate- or high-throughputapproaches. However, such evaluation of mutations assumes that the parameter evaluated is an appropriate surrogate for themechanism by which the gene impacts the human phenotype. For complex phenotypes such as MI that arise after decades ofpathology, it is often difcult to know whether this is the case.Nevertheless, distinguishing functional versus neutral missense mutations will be a key to improving statistical power. Modeling Human Genetic Disease in Reprogrammed Cells As an increasing number of genetic variants become associatedwith human disease, it will be essential to develop effective and accurate model systems to understand the mechanism of disease. This step is a prerequisite to translate genetic ndingsinto new targets for therapy. Animal models have traditionally been used to mimic human mutations through gene knockin approaches or study of null mutations ( Bruneau et al., 2001; Lindsay et al., 2001 ). Though this approach has been of value and has led to many discoveries, it is more common that mouse models fail to effectively recapitulate the human phenotype. This situation is even true for Mendelian traits, wherein heterozygousdeletion of human disease genes is often well tolerated in mice, whereas homozygous deletions can have catastrophic consequences, failing to model the human condition. For manyhuman disease genes, this has been a bottleneck, limiting the value of gene-hunting approaches described above. Figure 3. Estimate of Sample Sizes Required for Gene Discovery in Exome Sequencing Studies of Complex Traits Extrapolations were performed using gene resequencing counts from published candidate gene studies. Fisher's exact test was performed for gene burden testing on mutation carrier status within each study. The red horizontal line indicates the genome-wide p value threshold (p = 2.5 310/C06) for gene burden of rare variants with minor allele frequencies < 1%. The extrapolations show that thousands of samples are needed to exceed statistical signicance at a genome-wide level. Rare variant counts for ANGPTL3 ,ANGPTL4 , and ANGPTL5 for plasma triglycerides were obtained from Romeo and colleagues ( Romeo et al., 2009 ); APOA5 ,APOB ,GCKR LPL for et al., 2010 );SLC12A3 /SLC12A1 /KCNJ1 from Ji and colleagues (Ji et al., 2008 ). Cell148, March 16, 2012 \u00aa2012 Elsevier Inc. 1251The recent revolution in cellular reprogramming technology provides a potential solution to the need for disease modeling (Figure 4 ). The striking observation by Yamanaka and colleagues that human adult somatic cells could be reprogrammed into a pluripotent state by expressing four transcription factors not only revolutionized the eld of stem cell biology, but also hasmajor consequences for the study of human genetics ( Takahashi et al., 2007 ). Investigators can now reprogram skin or blood cellsfrom patients with dened genetic variants/mutations intoinduced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells and can then differentiate the iPS cells into the specic cell type affected by disease. This approach provides an unprecedented opportunity to inves-tigate the consequences of human genetic variation on cellular phenotypes that may contribute to disease. There have been several reports of partial modeling of CVD using human iPS cellsin the last 2 years, although success to date has been limited todiseases with discrete cell-autonomous cellular defects. We will consider a few examples below and highlight the advantages and limitations of this approach. Autosomal-dominant long QT syndrome (LQTS) that predis- poses to cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death involvessingle-gene mutations of sodium or potassium channels thatprovide a discrete and quantitative phenotype in iPS-derived cardiomyocytes. In LQTS, repolarization of cardiomyocytes is delayed, resulting in a prolonged action potential duration.Several groups have reported successful generation of iPS-derived cardiomyocytes from patients with LQTS, and an elon- gation of the action potential duration has been reported for a subset of genetically induced LQTS ( Itzhaki et al., et al., 2011 ). LQTS can also be drug induced in selected individuals, and pluripotent stem cell-derived cardio-myocytes appear to be an effective model system to detectprolongation of action potentials due to cardiotoxic drugs (Braam et al., 2010 ). It is exciting to consider that identication of common genetic variants that predispose to drug-induced LQTS might be modeled in iPS-derived cardiomyocytes, thereby allowing a system in which to screen for this toxic side effect prior to in vivo use of new drugs. Despite these successes, certain types of LQTS have been more difcult to model due to the incomplete maturation of iPS-derived cardiomyocytes and appropriate expression of ion channels in a consistent manner. It is possible that recent directreprogramming strategies involving transdifferentiation, which do not involve a progenitor intermediate, will allow modeling of diseases in which a mature cell type is required ( Ieda et al., 2010 ). The inability to expand mature, transdifferentiated cells is currently a rate-limiting factor for this approach, but futureimprovements in efciency of reprogramming may overcomethis hurdle. Another example of iPS-based modeling recently came from the study of Noonan and LEOPARD syndromes, autosomal-dominant conditions that involve pulmonary valve stenosis andhypertrophic subset of patients ( Gelb and Tartaglia, 2011 ). The genetic cause of Noonan and LEOPARD syndromes involves activating mutations in members of theRas pathway. Correspondingly, iPS-derived cardiomyocytes from patients with cardiomyopathy associated with LEOPARD syndrome exhibit higher levels of Ras signaling that appear tocontribute to excessive growth of cardiac cells ( Carvajal-Vergara et al., 2010 ). Though such ndings successfully model the pathway known to be affected, the ultimate goal will be toidentify new therapeutics that can disrupt abnormal pathwaysand restore normal physiology. This has remained elusive thus far, in part because most iPS-based disease models lead to broad variability in phenotype, whereas high-throughputscreening assays typically require a consistent phenotype with Figure 4. Modeling Human Genetic Disease in Reprogrammed Cells Reprogrammed cells derived from skin broblasts or blood cells of individuals with genetic variants associated with disease can be used for disease modeling and drug discovery and to determine the impact of sequence vari- ants on cellular biology. Reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells and subsequent directed differentiation to relevant cell types can yieldlarge numbers of human disease-related cell types for investigation. Specic genetic variants can also be engineered into human pluripotent stem cells using zinc-nger nucleases or TALENs to generate iPS or embryonic stem (ES)cells harboring disease-associated variants. Future approaches involving transdifferentiation may allow for a more direct approach to generate relevant cell types for study of CVD. In some cases, diseases will be cell autonomous, but other cases may require coculture of two or more cell types to recapitulate the disease process. 1252 Cell148, March 16, 2012 \u00aa2012 Elsevier Inc.a narrow range of variability. As protocols for generating iPS cells improve and directed differentiation methods become more consistent, ''disease in a dish'' models promise to alter the landscape of drug discovery ( Figure 4 ). Besides modeling the Mendelian syndromes described above, another potential use of iPS technology will be to anno-tate the function of SNPs identied by GWAS or rare mutationsdiscovered by sequencing. iPS cells are currently being gener-ated from large populations with dened genetic variants and CVD in the hope that certain aspects of the phenotype could be modeled in iPS-derived cells. It may prove difcult to identifyconsistent phenotypic differences associated with genetic variants of small effect; however, it is possible that the genetic background present in affected individuals will be sufcient toreveal a cellular defect. The contribution of individual sequence variants in the context of complex genetic background issues can be interro-gated through the use of recently developed DNA correctionapproaches in human pluripotent stem cells. The use specically introduce or re-move a sequence variant in stem cells will reveal the contribu- tion of individual variants to cellular phenotypes ( Yusa et al., 2011 ). Addition of environmental stresses to the cellular system may be necessary to provoke phenotypes and will be an impor-tant tool in disease modeling in iPS cells. Such studies are currently underway, and we look forward to the challengesand opportunities offered by this new approach to modeling human genetic variants. Conclusions The tools to decode human genetic variants on a large popula- tion scale have nally arrived and should begin to reveal thegenetic contribution to disease at an exponential pace. Rigorous analysis of the functional consequences of sequence variants associated with disease will be critical, and new approachesleveraging stem cell technologies may facilitate study of humanvariants in relevant human cell types. Ultimately, the conver- gence of human genetics with functional biology will reveal new therapeutic targets for cardiovascular disease and willstimulate a new generation of drug discovery efforts.
