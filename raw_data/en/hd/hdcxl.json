This includes the muscle, connective tissue, tendons, ligaments, and skin. Varying degrees of pressure and movement are used depending on your reason for seeking this type of treatment. Many people think of massage as a single treatment with no variations. However, this isn't the case at all. There are numerous different types of massage therapy techniques, each of which also has slightly different benefits for your mind and body. So, how do you choose the right type of massage therapy? When you choose an experienced and skilled massage therapist, they will be able to advise you which technique will be most effective at treating the concerns that you have. For example, deep tissue massage is principally recommended for physical healing while aromatherapy massage therapy tends to be focused on relaxation and improving emotional wellbeing. To help you discover which is the right type of massage for you, here's a little information about the most popular techniques. A Swedish massage is a gentle full-body massage that is primarily used to reduce tension and promote relaxation. It is also the most common type of massage and if you have ever had a general massage such as in a spa before, you will be familiar with the technique which involves: Long, flowing strokes in the direction of the heart Kneading Deep, circular motions Vibration and tapping Most Swedish massages are performed in under 90 minutes. Aromatherapy massages use the physical technique of Swedish massage but combine it with the use of essential oils which are both absorbed through the skin and inhaled in order to produce a therapeutic effect. Aromatherapy massages can either be full-body or back and shoulders only. Some of the ways in which aromatherapy massage can help include: Reducing muscle tension Reducing stress and anxiety Relieving mild to moderate pain Improving your mood Helping to reduce the symptoms associated with depression Again, most aromatherapy massages will last between 60-90 minutes depending on whether you are having a full body massage, or it is simply focusing on the back and shoulders. This type of massage is also sometimes called a deep tissue massage since it isn't strictly reserved for patients who have sporting injuries. However, it is particularly effective at treating repetitive use injuries to muscles and other similar types of damage. Sports massage is also used by many professional athletes as a way to increase flexibility, reduce muscle tension and boost their overall performance. It can even help to relieve pain. Trigger points are areas within the muscles that become particularly tight when the patient has suffered an injury to the muscle, is experiencing chronic pain or has another specific issue or condition. When these become tight, it can cause pain and other problems in other parts of your body. Unsurprisingly, trigger point massages focus on reducing the tightness within the trigger point. It does this using broad, flowing strokes combined with moments of stronger, deeper and firmer pressure. In relieving the tightness in these trigger points, it causes the body to produce endorphins which are natural pain relievers. Trigger point massage has been proven to be effective at reducing various types of pain including neck, shoulder, back, knee, muscle, and joint pain. Some studies have also shown that trigger point massage therapy can be used to alleviate the pain of sciatica and headaches. Thai massage is a little different from conventional massage since it involves movements that are similar to yoga. In addition to applying firm pressure to your body using their hands and fingers, your therapist will also twist and stretch your body in various positions. Patients typically remain fully clothed in loose, comfortable clothing. Thai massage has been shown to be beneficial in increasing patient flexibility, improving energy levels, boosting circulation, reducing pain and stress and improving mood. Being pregnant doesn't exclude you from the benefits of massage therapy, although as you may expect, the technique will have to be adapted to accommodate your condition. This principally means lying on your side, sitting upright in a chair or using a table that is designed specifically with a cut out for your abdomen so that there is no pressure on your baby. Prenatal massages are designed to help with muscle tension, body aches, stress, and tension.
