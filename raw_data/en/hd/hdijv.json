Here's what you need to know. Timestamps: 0:00 Vaccine-induced autoimmunity 0:53 What is adjuvants 9:29 Need keto consulting? In this video, we're going to talk about ASIA. ASIA is an autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants. What does this mean? We'll ASIA is essentially when a vaccine triggers an autoimmune situation. This information comes straight from a textbook called Vaccines and Autoimmunity. This book is written using decades of experience in vaccinology, immunology, and autoimmunity. Aluminum hydroxide is one of the adjuvants found in vaccines\u2014in fact, it's the only approved adjuvant in the United States. This word \"adjuvant\" means to help\u2014or to make the immune response strong. Macrophages actually eat the aluminum, carry it through the lymphatic system across the blood-brain barrier, where the aluminum gets stuck. In Vaccines and Autoimmunity, the author talks about how vaccines can cause autoimmunity in susceptible individuals. For instance, the vaccine for Lyme disease is capable of triggering arthritis in animal studies. Many of these effects can be delayed up to 10 months or even longer. In susceptible people, vaccines can even trigger possibly fatal autoimmune conditions. Without being screened, children receive around 19 vaccines during infancy. This could be a huge problem when it comes to autoimmunity. The toxicity from these types of metals accumulate over time, and the reactions are often delayed between weeks up to years. "}
