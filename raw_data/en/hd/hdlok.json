McCann, MD Objectives Discuss the scope of the problem of mold and mycotoxins Health impacts of mold from allergies to digestive issues Review definition and diagnostic criteria for Environmentally Acquired Illness (formerly known as CIRS -Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome) Highlight interventions and treatment strategies both from the Shoemaker and Brewer protocols Introduce concepts of the mycobiome and fungal biofilms and the emerging literature on health impacts Brief exploration of Mast Cell Activation Disease; diagnosis, testing and treatment Review literature on phosphatidyl choline and membrane stabilizing therapies Discuss specific patient teaching points Mold and Fungi Over 200,000 species of fungi, including mold, yeast, and mushrooms. More than 100,000 mold species have been identified. Molds are ubiquitous outside and live on many plants and food. They spread and reproduce by producing spores. Fungus and mold comprise 25% of the world's biomass. Exposure to molds can also occur by ingestion, inhalation of contaminated air and dermal contact Indoor molds proliferate in environments that contain excessive moisture, such as from leaks in plumbing, roofs, walls, and potted plants. The most common molds found indoors are Cladosporium, Penicillium, Aspergillus, and Alternaria, Stachybotrys and Trichoderma species. Daschner A. An Evolutionary -Based Framework for Analyzing Mold and Dampness -Associated Symptoms in DMHS. Front. Immunol. 2017; 7:672. Beneficial uses of molds Koji mold, an aspergillus species is used in the making of soy sauce Koji molds also break down the starch in rice, barley, sweet potatoes in the production of sake and other distilled spirits . Some sausages incorporate starter cultures of molds to improve flavor and reduce bacterial spoilage during curing. Geotrichum candidum and Penicillium species are used in the production of various cheeses including Brie and Blue cheese. Derived from Penicillin notatum, Alexander Fleming's discovery of Penicillin in 1928 transformed medicine. Used for centuries in China as both food and medicine, red yeast rice is made by fermenting a type of yeast called Monascus purpureus over red rice> it is used today for lowering cholesterol as it contains a chemical called monacolin K, has the same makeup as the drug lovastatin. Discovered in 1971, Cyclosporine immunosuppresses T cells without excessive toxicity. Cyclosporine was isolated from the fungus Tolypocladium inflatum by J. F. Borel. Decomposition of living matter.

Environmental Enteropathy Condition characterized by increased intestinal permeability, villous atrophy, impaired gut immune function, malabsorption, growth faltering, and oral vaccine failure without overt diarrhea. Pathology changes similar to celiac disease, but not tropical sprue. Unclear etiology. Possibly related to fecal -oral contamination or mycotoxin contamination. Maize and groundnuts common in developing world diet. Often contaminated with Aspergillus and Fusarium. Mycotoxins aflatoxin (AF), fumonisin (FUM) and Aspergillus strains can produce AF and ochratoxin and Fusarium mold strains can produce FUM, and zearalenone. Korpe and Petri.

Women in their first trimester who consumed fumonisin laden tortillas had a significant increase in their fetuses having spina bifida/craniofacial anomalies due to fumonisin which inhibits the biosynthesis of phospholipids, which interferes with the uptake of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and decreases total folate binding. Missmer SA et al, 2005 NeuroLipid Research, Dr. Patricia KaneWater Damage and Dampness Dampness in buildings ranges from 20% in studies in Europe and Canada to 50 -60% in USA and parts of Asia. Case control studies of asthma in West bank and Gaza reveal 56-78% damp problems, leaks or indoor mold. Lower income and lower education associated with higher likelihood of dampness and mold. Lawrence Berkeley report from 2009. 47% of US homes with dampness or water damage. 85% percent of other buildings had past water damage and 45% had current water leaks.

Also role in tumor suppression and promoting tolerance to allergens and self -antigens. C4a level (complement cascade) Split product of complement activation. Increased vascular permeability, capillary hypoperfusion. Represent an excessive innate immune response to biotoxins. High C4a levels may also be seen in Lupus and Lyme disease. Environmentally Acquired Illness Labs MMP -9 (Matrix metalloproteinase -9) level Zinc -dependent enzyme involved in remodeling extracellular matrix Correlates with high toxin load. Marker for disease progression. Associated with increased permeability in the blood brain barrier Implicated in pathogenesis COPD by destruction of lung elastin, in level A marker of capillary hypo -perfusion. A low level of skeletal muscle VEGF is associated with decreased muscle endurance. Other symptoms include persistent fatigue, cognitive difficulties, difficulty recovering from even mild activity Early in biotoxin illness, VEGF can run high, a sign that it is trying to help compensate for low oxygen delivery to issues. VIP (vasointestinal active peptide) level Neuroregulatory hormone, regulates cytokines and inflammatory responses. Marker of blood flow regulation and distribution. Low levels are associated with capillary hypo perfusion and abnormal pulmonary artery pressure at rest or in response to exercise. MSH (melanocyte stimulating hormone) level Marker of neuropeptide control of multiple functions. Alpha MSH binding to receptors in the brain and on white blood cells reduces inflammatory responses, including decreased production of pro -inflammatory cytokines. Symptoms often include fatigue and unusual pain syndromes. Visual Contrast Sensitivity (VCS) test The nerve fibers in the upper/outer portions of the optic nerve carry \"edge detection\" information, ability to discern visual contrast. Test is designed to distinguish differences in shading, thickness and separation of grey on grey lines.

Testing is simple, only requiring small amounts of dust or material from AC or heater filters. $299. can be order directly by patient. Case 1: House Mold Testing 698,000!!! 1420 Testing and remediation The test is only as good as the sample collection. If the musty smell is in the bathroom, sampling in the living room may not reflect the full extent of the problem. Utilize an qualified inspector who will use the appropriate testing methods available, including ERMI or HERSTMI2, air samples and wall samples when indicated. Certified Indoor Environmental Professional Read the Consensus Statement for indoor environmental professional (IEP) on inspection and remediation. https://www.survivingmold.com/docs/IEP_CONSENSUS_04_12_16.pdf An inspector should never be the remediator. Often the remediator is not the contractor to repair the work. Some situations require plumbers and general contractors. Patients and health care practitioners need to advocate for themselves. Very few IEPs, remediators or contractors understand the level of remediation required for HLA susceptible persons. Treatment of Mold Exposure GET AWAY FROM THE MOLDY ENVIRONMENT!! Avoid other moldy environments. Avoid other environmental toxins; such as pesticides, formaldehyde, fragrances, plastics, chemicals, heavy Metals, EMR Leave any belongings that can't be cleaned. All cloth and porous surfaced materials will be difficult to clean. Any items kept, should be cleaned and placed in storage for several months to ensure no mold growth. Use High Quality HEPA Air filters and be sure to change out the filters after the mold/remediation Get in your car and drive away!

HOW THE AIR REACTOR WORKS \"We use UV lighting (not to kill with) but to separate the light rays into different colors. What we have found with our research is that once the light rays are separated into different colors, different molecules attach to different color of light rays. We then developed a reactor pad, for these Molecules to travel through. While they are attached to different colors of light rays and travel through our specially designed reactor pad, it actually changes the molecular structure of that Molecule so that it is not what it was. Basically it implodes the molecule so that it does not exist as the molecule that it once was.\" -from the website...

Mold exposed patients had different cytokine and chemokine profiles when their peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were exposed to mold vs non -exposed controls. ROS are cleared from the cell by the action of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), or glutathione peroxidase (GPx). The main damage to cells results from the ROS -induced alteration of macromolecules such as polyunsaturated fatty acids in membrane lipids, DNA. Hossam M. May; 10(5). Mycotoxins Induce Oxidative Stress and Inflammation Mold toxins may suppress the immune system through a balance of cytotoxicity and altered Th1/Th2 balance, with increase Th1. The alteration of immune responses due to chronic mold exposures may also adversely affect the ability of the immune system to fight infections and other environmental challenges. This may explain patient complaints of concurrent susceptibility to infectious organisms and enhanced responses to chemical irritants. Hossam El -Din M. the Mycobiome Mycotoxins (ingested or inhaled) in the GI tract Affect regeneration and repair of intestinal epithelial cells Increase intestinal mucosal permeability Alter immune system response Changes the composition of intestinal bacterial communities (and possibly the fungal mycobiome) Are carcinogens in hepatocellular may turn pathogenic Fungal pathogens elicit complex innate and adaptive immune responses Some genetic polymorphisms/predispositions increasing susceptibility to systemic fungal infections and induce chronic inflammation resulting in IBD colitis.

Mycobiome affected similarly to microbiome. (age, BMI, birth circumstance, diet, geography, toxicants, tobacco, antibiotic usage, etc.) Some mycobiome from food sources Fungal -bacterial interactions very complex. Synergistic and antagonist Fungus as pathogen. Fungus as commensal perhaps not as clear cut as once assumed. Wang, ZK et al. Review article: Pharmacol Ther - 66. Relationship between humans and fungi denotes a paradox. Invasive fungal infections are rare...(but) the absence of a host -parasite relationship is associated with higher pathogenicity. Humans have a higher investment in prevention and elimination of these potential invaders, thus the pro -inflammatory response of the host is magnified. Daschner 2017 Fungal proteins and polysaccharides are present in the blood and fungal proteins and DNA was detected in the brain tissue of 100% of AD patients. Direct visualization of intracellular fungal infection in the neurons from the frontal cortex was demonstrated with fungal -specific antibodies, all of which were absent in controls. Fungal cells and hyphae were detected inside capillaries and blood vessels. Pisa 2015 Fungal antigens and DNA from several fungi were detected in the CFS of ALS patients. Fungal DNA was also detected in brain tissue using PCR analysis and proteomic analyses of brain tissue demonstrated with occurrence of several fungal peptides. In familial ALS, the most common gene mutation is of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) which is an antioxidant defense gene involved in innate immune response to a number of pathogens, including fungi.

Stremmel 2012 Despite major public health efforts, coronary heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in the United States. Oxidized lipids contribute to heart disease both by increasing deposition of Ca++ on the arterial wall, a major hallmark of atherosclerosis, and by interrupting blood flow, a major contributor to heart attack and sudden death. Oxidized cholesterol (oxysterols) enhances the production of sphingomyelin (SM), a phospholipid found in the cellular membranes of the coronary artery. This increases the SM content in the cell membrane, which in turn enhances the interaction between the membrane and ionic calcium (Ca++), thereby increasing the risk of arterial calcification. Thanks to Edward Kane for this info Both rat and human studies showed administration of Phosphatidyl choline led to improvements in memory and performance. Pre -test MMSE scores averaged at 15. Five months later, MMSE scores rose to over 20 after daily intake of combination PC of 90 -100mg/kg/day. Nagata 2011.

Mast cells are type of white blood cells, specifically, granulocytes derived from myeloid stem cell that is part of the immune and neuroimmune system. Each mast cell contains secretory granules (storage sacs), each containing powerful biologically active molecules called mediators, like histamine and heparin. These can be secreted when mast cells are triggered, leading to allergic and inflammatory diseases. Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) Testing for Mast cell Activation Syndrome Must stop all NSAIDS, aspirin or other salisylates and all PPIs 5 days prior to testing. It is ok to continue H2 blockers like zantac or pepcid or other histamine blockers such as bendaryl, zyrtec or Claritin if necessary. If at all possible, stop these. 1. Chilled serum trypase 2. Chromogranin A 3. Plasma prostaglandin D2 4. Histamine 5. Heparin 6. Random urine N -methylhistamine 7.

Anti -IgE-receptor antibody testing (define autoimmune urticaria) All blood tests must be collected on ice, spun down in the cold centrifuge, and sent frozen. For random urine collections, they must be kept cold (either on ice or in the refrigerator) until they are processed in the Reference lab, and then sent frozen. For 24 hour urine collections, they must be kept refrigerated during collection (as usual), and sent frozen.Molderings et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology 2011, 4:10 http://www.jhoonline.org/content/4/1/10 MCAS typically presents as chronic, persistent or recurrent, waxing and waning or slowly progressive multisystem polymorbidity generally, but not necessarily, of an inflammatory theme. It is usually acquired early in life via unknown mechanisms; interaction of environmental factors with inheritable risk factors is one possibility. Variable and numerous mutations in MC regulation lead to heterogeneity of presentations.
