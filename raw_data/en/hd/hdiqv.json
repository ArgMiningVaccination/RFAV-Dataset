It evolved out of Anthroposophy \u2014 a system of knowledge of the whole human being \u2014 formulated by Rudolf Steiner in the first quarter of the twentieth century. It is founded on the understanding of the human being as a living Body, Soul and Spirit, and on the exact description of these three aspects in health and illness. Health is seen in the healthy interaction of these members; ill-health in the disturbance of their equilibrium; and healing is brought about through the therapeutic substances or activities that will restore the balance. Anthroposophically Integrated Medicine describes the correspondences and specific relationships that exist between the human being, the starry universe and the surrrounding world of nature. Understanding the nature of the specific substances and forces within the mineral, plant and animal kingdoms enables these to be harnessed pharmaceutically and used rationally and individually in therapy. Understanding the nature of Soul and Spirit and their connection to the Body provides for the exploration of the psychospiritual dimensions in illness and healing. Illness can thereby be treated at a deep level. Transformation and self-empowerment is actively supported as part of the healing process. Anthroposophically Integrated Medicine forms a broad medical framework into which other therapeutic systems such as homeopathy, naturopathy and acupuncture can be integrated. Other therapies used in this integrated medical system to assist the healing process include therapies evolved out of other therapies derived from health disciplines such as: [homeopathy], naturopathy, is a cancer therapy developed out of anthropsophically integrated medicine.
