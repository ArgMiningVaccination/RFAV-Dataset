List of natural organic plug in air fresheners Standard air fresheners contain hazardous chemicals that can be inhaled ( [or even cause skin problems](https://www.poison.org/articles/air-freshener-171) ). Fortunately, several manufacturers offer a natural toxin-free alternative to the dangers of the standard air-freshener. [1.

Reviews Most reviewers loved the woodsy smell while others claimed it smelled fake (it really seems to be a matter of personal taste). Commenters also pointed out that the adjustable strength of the warmer is very useful and that in most rooms the lowest strength gets the job done. [3.

You can choose 4 different scents out of a list of 17 scents (All 100% natural). Another great thing about the [scent fill all-natural air plugin](https://bit.ly/3DYYJTm) is that it's delivered in a cardboard box with %50 less plastic. This is pretty great compared to other brands on our list that their products are delivered in that unnecessary plastic packaging.
