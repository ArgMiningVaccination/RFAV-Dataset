HEALTH STATUS AND GENERAL ASSESSMENT 1. Health status Over the past 5 years, Vietnamese people's health status has been improved remarkably, reflected in the following core health indicators: the life expectancy at birth has seen a year - on - year increase, from 72.9 years i n 2010 to 73.3 years in 2015 (70.7 years for men and 76.1 years for women); the infant mortality rate decreased from 15,5 in 2011 to 14,7 in 2015; the under - five mortality rate decreased from 23,3 in 2011 to 22,1 in 2015; the under - five malnutrition ra te (underweight) decreased from 16.8% in 2011 to 14.1% in 2015. However, there have been wide disparities in core health indicators between rural - urban residents, across regions, and among population groups, which have not been narrowed down in recent year s. The disease patterns in Vietnam are currently in a transitional period, with multiple burdens from infectious diseases and non - communicable diseases (NCD) , accidents, trauma, and poisoning; and a number of new epidemic and rare diseases have emerged with un predictable trends. The proportion of hospital admissions due to infectious diseases dropped from 55.5% in 1976 to 19.8% in 2010, but increased to 25.3% in 2013. The proportion of hospital admissions due to NCD increased from 42.6% in 1976 to 71.5% in 2010 and decreased to 63.5% in 2013. The rate of mortality due to NCD rose quickly from 45.5% in 2010 to 69.63% in 2013, taking up the largest proportion, followed by rates of mortality due to accidents, poisoning, trauma (18.15%) and infectious diseases (12.23%). 2. General assessment of implementation results Thanks to attention and direction from the Party, the National Assembly , and the Government, and collaboration among ministries, agencies, and P rovincial Peop le's Committees (PPC), the 4 health sector has strived to basically fulfill 7 key duties of the health sector over 2011 - 2016 1 ; achieved and exceeded most core health indicators in the 5 - year plan and annual plans. Overall results obtained in operational area s of the health sector have been commended and highly appreciated by Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung and contributed significantly to people's health protection and care, thus generally contributing to the country's achievements over the last years 2 . Some outstanding results include : (1) Timely prevention against epidemic attacks and outbreaks;(2) Effective implementation of the Scheme on Overcrowding Reduction thanks to efforts to mobilize sources of investment capital, complete new facilities, accelerate implementation of the Scheme on satellite hospitals, transfer techniques, and sending health staff from higher levels to lower levels on a rotating basis to improve quality and qualifications of lower levels and reduce the rate of referral to higher levels ; (3) 76.52% of the population has participated in health insurance (HI) , which exceeds the target assigned by the Party and the National Assembly; (4) Improvement of service attitudes following a patient - centered approach towards patients' satisfaction ha s been agreed upon and implemented in the whole sector, and initial results have been obtained and supported by the public; (5) Recognition by the World Heath Organization ( WHO ) to reach standards for the national regulatory authority (NRA) of vaccines; ( 6) Development of a number of high technologies and new technologies, especially organ transplantation; (7) Comprehensive and consistent renovation of the health organizational system at commune level, district level, and provincial level for integration a nd development; (8) International recognition for implementing Millennium Development Goals in health . However, there are still many difficulties and challenges in p eople's health protection, care and promotion , such as: (1) Increasing demand of the public for health protection, care and improvement despite limited funding and resources for the health sector; (2) Overlapping focal points and lack of consistency in the organizational structure of the health system; (3) A large gap in the quality of health s ervices and people's health indicators among regions; (4) Overcrowding in a number of hospitals at Central level and in big cities not completely resolved; (5) Limited combination between prevention and treatment and rehabilitation, and between traditiona l medicine and modern medicine; (6) Low HI participation rates and limited budget leading to high rates of out - of - pocket expenditures and limited balancing and risk - sharing capability of the HI fund; limited mobilization of resources for health from the p rivate sector; (7) Inappropriate allocation of human resources in health and lack of appropriate incentives for health staff; (8) Undeveloped pharmacy industry and ineffective exploitation of plentiful domestic sources of medicinal materials; (9) The h ealt h information system (HIS) unable to meet requirements for management purposes. II. PERFORMANCE IN EACH BUILDING BLOCK OF THE HEALTH S YSTEM 1. Health service delivery 1 (1) Reducing hospital overcro wding ; (2) Renovating financial mechanisms of public non - business health units ; (3) Implementing road map for universal health coverage ; (4) Strengthening health care at grassroots level and primary health care; (5) Developing health workforce ; (6) Pilotin g delivery of demand - based health services ; (7) Improving effectiveness of health communication and education 2 At the conference on 15/01/2016 on evaluation of 2015 health activities, implementation of 2016 plan, and main duties over 2016 - 2020 5 1.1. Preventive medicine Achievements: Capacity for forecast, supervision and prevention of ep idemics has been strengthened; in the past five years, many dangerous epidemic diseases have been successfully prevented and controlled, no major epidemics occurred, and newly emerging epidemic diseases (Ebola, MERS - CoV, H7N9, etc.) blocked and prevented. Several new vaccines are included in the Extended Program on Immunization, the rates of full immunization for infants, pregnant women, and women of reproductive age have been maintained at above 90%. Polio eradication, neonatal tetanus elimination, and lep rosy eradication at provincial level have been retained. Morbidity and mortality of some prevail diseases have decreased over the years. Morbidity and mortality rates of dengue fever have reduced respectively from 147 and 0.12/100,000 people in 2010 to 84 and 0.06/100,000 people in 2015. The prevalence of dengue fever in 2015 dropped by 16.6% in the whole country, and its mortality fell by 36.8% compared to the average rate of 2006 - 2010. For hand - foot - mouth disease, the morbidity and mortality rates also de clined from 126 and 0.19 in 2011 to 58 and 0.006 per 100,000 people in 2015; the morbidity rate fell by 31.9% in 2015, and mortality rate by 90% compared to the average rate during 2011 - 2013. During 2003 - 2010, the whole country recorded 119 cases of infl uenza A (H5N1) with 59 deaths. However, since 2011, Vietnam has only recorded 8 cases with 5 deaths Prevention and control of NCD have, step by step, been effectively implemented. In the period from 2011 to 2014, through projects unde r National Targeted Programs, detection, screening and treatment services were delivered to about 600,000 people with hypertension, 236,000 people with pre - diabetes and diabetes, and 10,000 people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma; more than 10% of the communes performed hypertension management activities. In 2012, the Ministry of Health (MoH) and the Ministry of Education and Training signed a collaborative Program and Plan on children and students' health protection, education, and car e in educational institutions within the public educational system over 2012 - 2020. Regarding health environment management, treatment of medical waste has seen improvements with about 54.4% of hospitals having waste water treatment systems in place, increa sing by 12% in comparison with 2010. Regarding management of solid medical waste, over 95% of hospitals have daily practice of classification and collection of hazardous solid waste, 29.4% of which use double - compartment incinerators or using microwave/wet heat to disinfect medical hazardous waste while the rest still handle it with one - compartment incinerators, manual burning, land - filling or through outsourcing services. Inspection teams have been established to check and monitor quality of running water. Management of labor health environment, and evaluation of environmental impacts and management of anti - bacterial and anti - insect chemicals and products for household and medical use have been strengthened. Vietnam has reached the Millennium Development Go al in terms of access to clean water and hygienic latrines; in 2014, 92.0% of households were provided with clean water and 79.2% had hygienic latrines. By December 2015, there were 227.154 people living with HIV, 83.538 people with AIDS, and 86.249 dying of HIV. The rate of HIV/AIDS in the community was maintained at below 0.3% of the population, which met all the three criteria: reduction in the rate of new HIV infections, the rate of infections having progressed to AIDS, and the rate of AIDS - related deat hs. The number of new HIV infections reduced from 17.800 in 2010 to 10.000 in 2015, the number of 6 deaths from 3.300 in 2010 to 2.000 in 2015, and the number of AIDS patients from 8.900 in 2010 to 6.500 in 2015. The rate of HIV infections treated with ARV i ncreased from 57.7% in 2011 to 67.6% in 2015. The number of drug addicts treated with Methadone increased from 12.253 in 2011 to 35.200 in 2015. All over the country, there have been over 2.6 million inspection visits to food facilities around 20% of which have been found violating food safety regulations; the total penalty collected from the violating facilities was worth approximately 99.6 billion dong, and their names have also been publicly announced. The food safety management system has been establish ed from the Central to the local level, and the food safety inspection system includes 01 National Food Safety and Hygiene Inspection Institute, 3 regional inspection centers, 14 State inspection authorities for imported food, and inspection offices under 63 provincial preventive medicine centers, thus basically meeting demand for food safety inspection. Communication and education on food safety on mass media have been promot ed. For the first time, there was a Decree on penalties for administrative violati ons in food safety at considerably increasing rates. Shortcomings and limitations: Although the morbidity rates of some prevail infectious diseases such as dengue fever and foot and mouth disease are declining over the years, they still remain very high; s ome vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, diphtheria, pertussis, and hepatitis B are still at high risk of relapsing. Strengthened international exchange and integration also increase the transmission risk, especially for newly emerging epidemic di seases. The rate of HIV infections is still high in Northern Uplands provinces and big provinces/cities; implementation of interventions in remote areas has faced a number of difficulties. TB patients' compliance with DOTS treatment, particularly in remote areas, is still limited; the parasite resistance to antimalarial drugs is at risk of spreading. Rabies is still among the top fatal infectious diseases. The responsiveness of the epidemic surveillance and response system still remains at a low level, an d announcement of cases from hospitals and private health facilities has not been performed actively enough. The rate of NCD detected, treated, and managed in the community is still modest; the health service delivery system has not b een able to meet demand; and projects are vertically implemented with overlapping focal points and a lack of integration, comprehensive approaches and long - term, continuous care services. There remain wide disparities in coverage of latrines across regions ; 18 provinces have the coverage of hygienic latrines of below 50%, and over 10% of rural households do not have latrines. Capacity for waste management, environmental monitoring, and pollution management in health facilities is still limited; and the heal th environment monitoring system has not been strengthened. Food poisoning remains complicated and shows no declining trend, especially cases of fewer than 30 people which mostly occurred to family households. A number of food production and processing fac ilities have not complied with food safety and hygiene regulations; and the production, sale, and illegal import of dirty food are still prevalent. The stewardship and 7 collaboration across ministries and agencies in management and control of food safety an d hygiene are still limited. Health education and communication in some localities remain inappropriate and inflexible, and unable to spur wide - scale emulation movements for keeping hygiene and health promotion. Coordination with media agencies is still li mited, inadequate and passive. 1.2. Medical examination, treatment and rehabilitation Achievements: Performance indicators such as patient visits, numbers of inpatients and outpatients, the length of inpatient and outpatient treatment , and numbers of surg eries and procedures are increasing on a year - on - year basis . So far, the average number of patient visits has reached 2.34 visits per person per year and the average ratio of beds reached 24 beds per 10,000 people, thus gradually narrowing down disparities among regions regarding the indicators on access to and benefit from health services . The rate of cases examined and treated with traditional medicine in the total number of cases at each level has been improved although it still takes up a small portion out of the total number of patient visits at all levels, i.e. 8 .8 % at province, 9.1 % at district and 24.6 % at commune level. The system of traditional medicine has been formed and developed at all levels , with 61 traditional medicine hospitals; 90% of mode rn medicine hospitals have traditional medicine departments or sections, 74.3% of commune health stations (CHS) have traditional medicine sections. More attention has been paid to maritime medicine: A national steering committee on maritime medicine has be en established, conducting research on current situations and developing a model of health service delivery for island districts 3 . All over the country, there are around 17 1 private hospitals , accounting for 11% of total hospitals in Vietnam , including 06 foreign invested hospitals and over 30 , 000 private clinics and health facilities . The rate of beds in private hospitals accounts for 4 .8 % of total hospital beds , making about 1 .1 beds per 10,000 people. Solutions to easing hospital overcrowding have been deployed in an active and comprehensive manner: focusing on accelerating the progress of key projects, and the ratio of hospital beds per 10,000 people increasing from 21.5 in 2011 to 24.0 in 2015 (or from 24.7 to 31.4 if actually occupied beds are counted ). Most public hospitals have been renovated or upgraded out of the State Budget a majority of which comes from Government bonds; 610/766 provincial and district hospitals have been completed, and 05 Central and highest level modern hospitals under constr uction in order to keep up with developed countries in the region. A network of 60 satellite hospitals of 15 key hospitals in 41 provinces/ cities has been developed. Circular 40/2015/TT - BYT dated 16/11/2015 was issued on registration for insured health se rvices and referral for insured health services. Training and technical transfer have been conducted for lower levels, and health staff sent to lower levels on a rotating basis. Overcrowding in most Central and provincial hospitals has been gradually addre ssed, and the bed occupancy rates have increased in district hospitals. 3 Prime Mi nister approved a Scheme on Development of Maritime Medicine according to Decision 317/QD - TTg 8 In 2013, the hospital quality management system was established 4 and the hospital quality assessment criteria were issued. After two years, 55.4% of hospitals throughout the country ha ve established hospital quality management sections or departments. The test quality control system has been established with 3 test centers and a lmost 1,400 laboratories. Medical examination procedures have been actively improved 5 , and cut down from 12 - 14 steps to 4 - 7 steps (depending on each condition), and the average examination time has been reduced to 48.5 minutes per examination (about 50%) compared to the pre - intervention period. Standard competencies for medical practice have been formulated and i nitially applied to nurses, midwives, and general practitioners. Clinical guidelines have been developed in large quantity, i.e. nearly 4,000 technical guidelines. The patient feedback system on service quality has been strengthened, and hotlines re - establ ished in all health facilities. The MoH issued Circular 07/2014/TT - BYT dated 25/2/2014 on the code of conduct for doctors, and relevant training has been provided to health staff. On 4/6/2015, the MoH issued Decision 2151/Q - BYT on the Action Plan for \"Ref orming service attitude and behavior of health staff towards patient satisfaction\", and after 5 months of implementation, more than 80 hospitals across the country, including 25/38 hospitals at Central level, signed the commitment. Civil servants and State officials' compliance with the code of conduct has been monitored, good examples are given compliments and violations are strictly punished; in necessary cases of serious or repeated violations, the violators may be relocated or expelled from the sector. The health sector has succeeded in applying a number of new, advanced technologies in diagnosis and treatment, for example, organ transplantation, cardiovascular diagnosis and intervention, endoscopy and endoscopic microsurgery in cranial neurosurgery, and post - natal screening; corneal transplantation; PET/CT - based Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy in cancer treatment; microsurgery in treatment of deep burns, etc. Shortc omings and limitations: The combination between prevention, treatment and rehabilitation, and between traditional medicine and modern medicine has been limited, thus unable to promote the advantages of traditional medicine; the network of rehabilitation se rvices remains technically limited. The health care model for the elderly has not been evenly and widely implemented. There are still discrepancies in the health service quality and health indicators across regions; overcrowding in some Central hospitals a nd hospitals in big cities has been addressed to a certain extent but still needs further settlement in the coming time. The quality management system is also limited: no independent rating agency has been established and about 44% of hospitals have not h ad their quality management departments/ sections. The clinical audit mechanism has not been operated while refusal to accept test results across health facilities still remains common. 1.3. Population - Family Planning and Mother - and - Child Health Care 4 According to Circular 19/2013/TT - BYT of the Minister of Health dated 12/7/2013 5 According to Decision 1313/QD - BYT of the Minister of Health dated 22 / 4 / 2013 9 Ach ievements: Quality of population - family planning services has been gradually improved, and communication on population - family planning has been promoted in various forms to access different target groups. Population and family planning services have be en delivered to people in 5,700 communes with high birth rates in disadvantaged areas. Provision of free - of - charge contraceptive devices is guaranteed at the same time with acceleration of social marketing activities. The population growth rate has been ma intained at approximately 1.05%/year, the population in 2015 was 91.7 million people, achieving the set target (<93 million people), and the model of families with fewer children is becoming more widely accepted. Vietnam reached the replacement fertility r ate in 2006, and this has been maintained since then. The population quality has been improved, and the average life expectancy is also increasing. The scheme on ante - natal and post - natal screening has been expanded from 11 to 63/63 provinces/cities; the r ate of ante - natal and post - natal screening has increased over the years: that of ante - natal screening increased from 1.5% in 2011 to 15% in 2015, and that of post - natal screening from 6% in 2011 to 30% in 2015. By 2015, the model of pre - marriage health cou nseling and check - up had been extensively and intensively implemented in 63 provinces/cities. Communication activities for behavioral change have been actively conducted in order to control the sex imbalance at birth, and the sex ratio at birth (SRB) only increased 0.18%/year over 2011 - 2015 (from 111,9 to 112,8 boys to 100 girls), in comparison with the increase of 0.7%/year over 2009 - 2011. Since 2011 when Vietnam officially entered the stage of \"population ageing\", the health sector has been preparing for developing relevant policies and action programs, and implementing the Scheme on community - based health care for the elderly in 29 provinces/cities having high rates of elderly people. Many documents on management and technical guidelines on reproductive h ealth have been updated, supplemented, revised, and developed. The Government issued Decree 10/2015/ND - CP dated 28/01/2015 on In Vitro Fertilization and conditions for surrogacy for humane purposes. Systematic measures have been taken, and inspection, supe rvision (even in private clinics), and specialized support for lower levels have been strengthened to minimize obstetric complications. Communication for policy advocacy and behavioral change in mother and child health care have also been paid attention to . The coverage of most essential reproductive health services has been expanded at both district and commune levels. The MoH issued Circular 07/2013/TT - BYT dated 08/03/2013 on standards, functions, and tasks of village health workers (VHW) among whom villa ge birth attendants are also considered a type of VHW ; 1,737 village birth attendants throughout the country have been trained, thus significantly contributing to the improvement of health status for mothers and children in ethnic minorities and disadvanta ged areas. The child malnutrition rate (underweight) dropped from 17.5% in 2010 to 14.5% in 2015; the stunting rate also sharply fell from 29.3% in 2010 to 24.9% in 2015. Vietnam has reached the MDGs in reduction of the maternal mortality ratio to 58.3% pe r 100.000 live births, and reduction of the infant mortality rate to 14.7%. The rate of pregnant women receiving ante - natal care at least 3 times is over 90%, the rate of deliveries assisted by trained birth attendants is 98%, and the rate of mothers and n ewborns receiving postnatal care in the first week after delivery is 81%. Shortcomings and limitations: 10 Unmet needs for reproductive care services, birth control methods, and family planning services still remain high in some vulnerable groups, including a dolescents, unmarried juveniles, migrants, people living with HIV, disabled people, people who are affected by natural disasters, sex workers, and gays and lesbians . Sex imbalance at birth remains high and the fertility rate is at risk of increasing in som e regions. Vietnam still maintains the replacement fertility rate, however, the fertility rate shows some signs of increase, from 1.99 children per woman in 2011 to 2.09 in 2014. There are still wide and increasing disparities in reproductive health indica tors among population groups and across regions. The maternal mortality ratio and infant mortality rate in some mountainous areas are even 3 - 4 times as much as those in lowland and urban areas, and almost twice as much as the national average rate. The chi ld malnutrition rates are still high in the Northwest and Central Highlands regions. Access to and use of quality ante - natal and intranatal care services in ethnic minorities and disadvantaged areas remain limited 6 . The need for prevention and early detec tion of preventable congenital defects is still prevalent due to unavailability of highly cost - effective screening services and interventions before and during pregnancy, and during the neonatal period . 2. Health workforce , science and technology Achievements : The number of types of health staff has been increasing over the years, reflected in the number of doctors per 10,000 people which increased from 7.2 in 2010 to approximately 8.0 doctors in 2015, and the number of graduate pharmacists per 10,000 people w hic h increased from 1. 76 in 2010 to approximately 2.2 pharmacists in 2015. In order to deal with the lack of health staff in some fields and in remote and disadvantaged areas, a number of policies and projects have been implemented, for example, a project on encouraging training and development of health human resources in the specialties of tuberculosis, leprosy, mental health, forensic medicine, and pathologic al anatomy during 2013 - 2020; a pilot project on voluntary young doctors; and a c ircular on stand ards, functions and tasks of VHW. The Law on Medical Examination and Treatment effective from 2011 required the medical practitioners to have a license for medical practice and continuously update their medical knowledge. By 2015, 95% of the health facilit ies and 92% of the health staff in MoH hospitals; 25% of the health facilities and 67% of the health staff in hospitals under other ministries and agencies; 65% of the health facilities and 89% of health staff in hospitals under provincial Departments of H ealth (DoH) had been licensed. Competency standards for certain types of health staff, including nurses (2012), midwives (2014), general practitioners (2015) have been issued. Educational accreditation for different types of health staff training and train ing institutions have been developed and implemented . The system of medical and pharmaceutical training institutions has been strengthened, re - 6 Am ong 225 geographically disadvantaged districts 33 districts were unable to conduct C esarean sections , 48 districts did not performed blood transfusion , 73 districts did not ha ve neonatal units, 81 district were unable to provide newborn jaundice treatment with light therapy, 137 districts were unable to treat neonatal respiratory failure with CPAP machine s ; among the 62 poorest districts, 23 districts remain ed unable to conduct C esarean sections and blood transfusion . 11 arranged, and gradually upgraded in terms of infrastructure and equipment. Need - based and address - based health st aff training for disadvantaged provinces has been provided. In leading hospitals, training - vertical direction centers have been established to provide intensive and advanced training to lower levels. Schools and training centers for hospital management h ave been established with thousands of hospital managers trained. Having mastered the technology of vaccine production, Vietnam has produced 10/11 types of vaccines for the Expanded Program on Immunization and been among 39 countries that possess advantage s in vaccine production in the world. The NRA of vaccines has been recognized by WHO to meet standards. Many hospitals have mastered technologies of multi - organ transplantation, vascular diagnosis and intervention, endoscopy, and reproductive support. Rese arch has been conducted for preservation and sustainable exploitation of genetic resources for precious and rare medicinal materials with nearly 4,000 kinds, advantages in terms of medicinal materials have been utilized, drugs have been produced out of med icinal materials with high treatment effectiveness for replacement of imported drugs, and over 300 types of medicinal materials have been exported for a high value. Shortcomings and limitations : The health workforce is unevenly distributed across regions a nd levels of care while quality of workforce remains an issue of concern to be given priority, especially at the grassroots level and in remote areas. The current health workforce is insufficient in quantity and poor in quality, and the number of provincia l health staff in preventive medicine only meets about 60% of needs. 7 Quality control for types of health staff training and training institutions has not been effectively performed. Management capacity of health staff at all levels remains limited; only 3 0% of health managers in health facilities are trained in management, and over 95% of them suppose that they lack management skills. 8 As a consequence of hospital overcrowding , irrelevant remuneration policies and negative impacts of the market economy on a number of health staff, there have been cases where health staff show improper behavior or attitudes to patients upon service provision, thus affecting the image of the health sector. 3. Health information system Achievements: The system of legal foundatio n on health information and statistical indicators have been systematically promulgated, including the H IS Development Strategic Plan for the period 2014 - 2020 with a vision to 2030; the set of health core indicators consisting 88 indicators of various sub - sectors; the list of core indicators for provincial, district, and commune levels; the catalogue of health statistical indicators; the system of health statistical forms applicable to public health facilities; reporting forms, reporting obligations and re sponsibilities of private health facilities; 7 Nguy en Thanh Long, V u Sinh Nam.

April 2014. 12 and regulations on issuance and utilization of birth reports to improve the quality of birth information. Many annual publications as important outputs of the health statistics system have continually been issue d, for example, the Annual Health Statistical Yearbook, Joint Annual Health Review (JAHR), Statistical Yearbook of infectious diseases, etc. The quality of statistics has been improved as a result of training of statistical staff, strengthened monitoring a nd evaluation, and strengthened use of information at all levels. In 2013, the M oH conducted a national survey on human resources and training needs for health statistics, compiled materials, and organized training - of - trainers courses for 63 provinces/citi es and Central units. Application of information technology (IT) in management and administration, and use of document management software and web - based administration have been deployed in all MoH units and DoH of all 63 provinces/cities. In terms of spec ialized applications, database and population changes of the population of over 90 million people have been developed and updated routinely ; other applications include software programs for hospital statistical reporting and management of medical practice in private sector; software programs for HIV/AIDS patient management and management of immunization; and hospital information software. A project on electronic HIV/AIDS database; software for surveillance of infectious diseases and medical records and mana gement of the medical examination and treatment system and a pilot project on application of electronic HI cards in management of insured patients have also been implemented ; IT application in training, technical transfer, and telemedicine under a scheme o n satellite hospitals have been deployed. Shortcomings and limitations: There are many data sources but the data dissemination mechanism is un cle a r ; there are no focal points for disseminating data of the health sector as well as related data of other sect ors . The system of information on death and causes of death is not yet compatible with WHO's recommendations. Information in medical records is not relevant to ensure the continuity in health monitoring, appropriate treatment, prevention of complications, adverse reactions and to ensure the effectiveness of health care. The quality of information has not been improved markedly. Information provided b y health facilities and localities is neither timely nor complete; there lacks information from private healt h facilities and health units of other ministries. IT application in data processing, analysis and reporting is limited. Most statistical indicators are collected through routine reports with inaccurate and unavailable data ; statistical survey and mining o f civil registration information have been implemented but remains at a limited level . 4. Pharmaceuticals, medical equipment and infrastructure 4.1. Pharmaceuticals, vaccines and biologicals Achievements: The MoH has advised competent agencies to issue, or d irectly issued 37 documents, including two important documents orienting the development of the pharmaceutical industry , which are: 13 (i) Medicinal Material Development Master Plan until 2020 with vision to 2030 9 ; (ii) Vietnam National Strategy for Pharmace utical Development until 2020 with vision to 2030 10 . The MoH has promulgated the 6 th l ist of e ssential d rugs of Vietnam , the list of modern medicines, herbal medicines or drugs made of medicinal herbs and traditional medicine s paid by HI scheme. The (revise d) Pharmaceutical Law has also been drafted and submitted to the National Assemb ly for consideration and promulgation . Drugs are supplied timely and adequately for medical examination, treatment and prevention of epidemics and natural disasters . The drug s upply system covers the whole country, with a ratio of 1 retail pharmacy to 2,123 people . Average expenditure on drugs increased from USD 22.25 per head in 2010 to USD 34.48 per head in 2014. Domestically produced drugs account for nearly 50%, meeting two - thirds of the active ingredients included in the 5 th list of essential drugs of Vietnam . In res ponse to the p roject \" Vietnamese people prioritize domestically produced drugs \", many hospitals use up to 80% of domestically produced drugs, which helps reducin g costs for patients . The drug market is in a stable status with no sudden and irrational increase of prices, which may affect the prevention, examination and treatment of diseases of people. The implementation of legal documents on management of drug pr ices and drug procurement has started to take effect, reduced expenditures on medicines in hospitals. Vietnam Social Security (VSS) is increasingly enhancing its role in controlling d rug prices and costs paid by social HI . Quality of drugs has been managed strictly and comprehensively in all stages from production, storage, circulation, distribution to whole sale, retail . All factories producing chemical pharmaceuticals have achieved G ood Manufacturing Practice ( GMP) compliance, 100% of big - size enterprises importing and trading drugs achieve Good Supply Practice (GSP) compliance. I nspection and monitoring the quality of drugs sold in the market are conducted regularly and systematically from central to local levels ; the proportion of sub - standard drugs has been decreased from 3.12% in 2010 to 2.38% in 2014 . Shortcomings and limitations: The development of the pharmaceutical industry into a key economic - technical industry in accordance with the Pharmaceutical Law 2005 is difficult . According to the United Nat ions Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO), the p harmaceutical industry in Vietnam is somewhere between levels 3 and 4 among the 5 levels . Value of locally - produced of drugs accounts for 0.72% of total GDP of Vietnam in 2014 and only 2.18% of the tot al national industrial production revenue in 2014, with small and medium - sized enterprises in terms of both human resource s and financing. Domestically produced drugs in Vietnam are not competitive in the world market because most of the m are used to tre at common diseases , generic drugs have been produced but their bioequivalence has not been well proved so it is difficult to export them . Generally, most people and even health workers like to prescri be and use imported drugs in health care and treatment . Control of drug prices is still challenging since there are no specific mandated authorities and 9 Decision no.1976/QD - TTg dated 30/10/2013 of the Prime Minister 10 Decision no. 68/QD - TTg dated 10/01/2014 of the Prime Minister 14 responsibilities between related ministries and sectors. Irrational use of drug s remains popular and over - the - counter sale of drug is prevalent while safe use of drug remains a concern of health facilities. Proportion of antibiotics use is high with rising r isk of antimicrobial resistance . Inspection, check and control of origin and quality of pharmaceutical materials used for production of eastern medicine s , dr ugs made of herbal materials and the use of these drugs in traditional medicine facilities are not done properly . Q uality of blood tests is limited whereas the network of facilities providing blood transfusion is scattered and fragmented . 4.2. Medical equ ipment and infrastructure Achievements: Investment in infrastructure to reduce hospital overcrowding and to improve health service quality is continued, with 610 out of 766 provincial and district hospitals constructed with the g overnment's bond s . Five mod ern and tertiary referral hospitals are under construction to be on a par with other advanced regional countries 11 , the system of satellite hospitals has been established in almost all provinces 12 . In the 2012 - 2015 period, 119 new hospital have been construc ted and put into operation ( at central level : 03 hospitals ; at local levels : 116 hospitals); 1, 839 departments /wards have been constructed, expanded, renovated ( at central level : 172, at local level : 1 , 667). The MoH is co ll a bora ting with the Ministr y of Co nstruction, People's Committees of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City to plan and decide the location and size of land to accommodate some hospitals after they are relocated from inner cities. Inspection of investment activities and use of equipment in health faci lities is strengthened . The MoH c ontinues to collaborate with the Ministry of Science and Technology , Medical Equipment Association of Vietnam and experts to promote research, to propose research priority topics and manufacturing/production of medical equi pment . The system of production, business and importation of medical equipment has been expanded. Currently the country has 48 research and manufacturing facilities of medical equipment with 621 products domestically produced and licensed to be sold in the market. The MoH is working with Ministry of Finance (MoF) to review and propose support ive tax policies for domestic manufacturers of medical equipment. IT is g radually appl ied in licensing importation of medical equipment in order to reform administrativ e procedures . The health sector is trying to strengthen storage and maintenance of medical equipment in which more attention has been paid to training of medical technologists. T he M oH has collaborat ed with Hanoi Polytechnic University to train a continge nt of bio - medical electronic engineers; made investment in and upgrad e of the Medical E quipment and Technique College with a new branch in Hanoi and Hai Duong Medical Techn ique College. So far, 62% of provincial general hospitals, 26.1% of provincial speci alized hospitals and 31.9% of district general hospitals have a medical equipment maintenance team . The M oH has work ed with related sectors to develop and issue a total 135 sectoral standards and 35 national standards for medical equipment. Capacity of t he network of medical equipment calibration and quality control has been strengthened . 11 Decision no.125/QD - TTg dated 16/01/2014 by the Prime Minister 12 D ecision no.774/QD - BYT dated 11/3/2013 of Minister of Health approving the project on satellite hospitals for 2013 - 2020 15 Shortcomings and limitations: Enfo rcement of policies on investment in and development of medical infrastructure and equipment at grass - roots level remains limited; De cis ion No. 1402/QD - TTg in 2007 on investment in district preventive health centers and D ecision No. 950/2007/QD - TTg on investment in CHS in disadvantaged areas have not been implemented due to lack of funding. Several lists of essential equipment and techn ical construction standards for different types of health facilities issued prior to 2010 have not been updated yet. H ealth technology assessment, calculation of cost - effectiv eness of the investment in and use of high - tech, expensive medical equipment rema in very limited. Mechanism for quality control (calibration, external control) has not been implemented in all health facilities. Accreditation and calibration centers have not been established in 3 regions. Although the proportion of locally - produced med ical equipment is increasing but it is still below the set targets . In addition, the production of medical equipment uses only simple technologies . The m aster plan for investment in medical infrastructure and equipment is not updated based on the people's health care needs and usability, and exclud es investment from the private sector . 5. Health financing Achievements: Total health spending from the state budget and government bonds in the period 2011 - 2015 was approximately 357,971 billion dongs, eq uivalent to 7.52% of the total s tate budget expenditure. If health spending is excluded from government bonds it is a round 6.8% of total state budget expenditure. The growth rate of health spending was higher than the average growth rate of the state budget expendi tures. In the context where aid to Vietnam tend s to be reduced, the health sec tor has constantly mobilized g rants, thus the proportion of aid has been maintained at 2% of the total health expenditure. According to Decree No. 85/2012/ND - CP, by 2018 the pri ce of health care services will include fully 7 components of cost 13 . In 2012, the MoH in collaboration with the MoF has adjusted the price bracket of some health services to include 3/7 direct components of cost . 14 In 2016, the MoH will continue to add wage s and allowances of health workers to the cos ts of insured health services . The implementation of the roadmap for calculating service costs correctly and fully will help health facilities have additional revenue s to cover the cost s spent on patients , contr ibuting to gradually i mproving the quality of service , at the same time the interests of patients with HI cards are increased . In recent years, the health sector has mobilized many resources outside the state budget by enhancing socialization through the f orm of loans for investment in infrastructure, delivery of health services upon request; joint - venture in medical equipment installation; public - private partnership (PPP). I n implementation of Resolution 93 /NQ - CP dated 15/12/2014 of the Government on a n umber of mechanisms and policies for health development for the purpose of 13 ( 1) Drugs, consumables, medical supplies ; (2) electricity, water, waste management, cleaning ; (3) wages and allowances of health workers ; (4) maintenance and repair costs ; (5) depreciation of properties ; (6) costs for running supporting units in health facilities ; (7) costs for training and application of new techniques . 14 ( 1) Drugs, consumables, medical supplies ; (2) electricity, water, w aste management, cleaning ; (3) maintenance and repair costs 16 mobiliz ing resources of the society for development of the health sector , some banks have preferentia l credit packages for hospitals and investors who want to borrow loans to inves t in construction and procurement of equipment in order to increase capacity and quality of healthcare. Health facilities c ontinue to be sorted and changed from partially autonomous facilities to full y autono m ous ones in terms of revenues and expenditures so that the state budget can save cost s to help people buy HI cards, striving for universal HI coverage . The sector c ontinue s to pilot capitation as a HI provider payment method at district level and d iagnosis - related g roup (DRG) ; as well as develops a bas ic health benefit package . The Fund for Tobacco Control was established in 2013 as a new source of financial contributions to the state budget for health care, with approximately 400 - 500 billion d o ng s per year . The H ealth Care Fund for the P oor continues t o be maintained in provinc es and cit ies , with funding from local budget and other legal sources. 15 The M oH h as worked closely with VSS and related ministries/sectors to develop and finalize HI polic ies and legislations , especially the Revised Health Insuran ce Law 2014 which has been passed by the National Assembly and effective since 1/1/2015. H I coverage has been increase d from 60.9% in 2010 to 76 .52 % in 201 5 . Apart from the increased HI coverage, benefits and entitl e ments of HI card holders are also expand ed. Co - payment rate is adjusted down to some groups. On average, a card holder ha d 2.1 visits per year in 2014 - an increase by 8.5% compared to that in 2010. Some PPC have spent local budget to pay parts of HI premium for people from near - poor households , contributing to increasing the HI coverage . This practice has been done by 3 9 out of 63 provinces nationwide , in which 27 provinc es pay the remaining 30 % of HI premiums and 12 provinces pay 5 - 20 % of the premium. Shortcomings and limitations: Investment o f the State in health has not m et the needs for people's health protection , care and promotion ; the out - of - pocket expenditures on heath of households remain high (about 45 %); the expansion of HI coverage to the remaining 24 % uncovered population is diffic ult , the possibility to balance the HI fund and risk sharing is low . There lack a relevant investment budget allocation mechanism an d an incentive financial mechanism to promote the quality and effectiveness of preventive medicine and public health . The ac cessibility of private health facilities to preferential policies is quite difficult ; joint - venture in installation of medical equipment in public health facilities brings positive results , however there is abuse of technical services , test s , imaging servi ces which leads to increase d health care costs . Service price has not been calculated correctly and fully; the operation and management of health facilities , especially public hospitals, are not renovated . There are no models or methods for administrating public hospitals in line with the socialist - oriented market economy . 6. Health governance 15 Decision No. 14/2012/Q D - TTg of the Prime Minister dated 01/3/2012 amending and supplem en ting a number of Decision No. 139/2002/Q D - TTg dated 15/10/2002 on medical examination and treatment for the poor. 17 Achievements: Health policy - making has shown progress : m any laws and health policies have been developed and issued , e.g. the Law on Tobacco Control (2012), the Law am ending and supplementing a number of article of the Health Insurance Law (2014); Resolution No. 68/2013/QH13; legal documents guiding the implementation of laws ; Health Sector Strategy for 2011 - 2020 with a vision to 2030 ,... At the moment , a number of other laws are drafted or revised, e.g. the Pharmaceutical Law, the Law on Alcohol Control , the Law on Blood and Stem Cell , the Population Law, Decree on Management of Medical Equipment , Decree on Vaccination , Government's Resolution on a number of mechanisms an d policies for health development ; the scheme on building and developing heath care at grassroots level in the new context , etc . , creating a legal frame work for the health sector to operate and develop . The o rganizational structure of the health sector h a s been adjust ed to meet its management needs . At central level , the Information Technology Administration and the Department of Communications and Emulation were established ; the organizational model o f a number of departments (e.g. Traditional Medicine D epartment , Administration and Science, Technology and T raining , ... ) was revised; a list of 71 MoH's non - business units was submi t t ed to and issued by the Prime Minister in Decision No. 246/QD - TTg dated 12 February 2014 ; the V ietnam National Coordinating C e nter for Human Organ Transplantation, 2 training institutions for health managers located in Hanoi School of Public Health and Ho Chi Minh City Public Health Institute and 5 regional centers for forensic psychiatry have been established , bringing the total number of non - business units under the MoH to 81 units . At local level, Decree No. 117/2014/ND - CP on health care at commune/ward/town level has formally affirmed that CHS is a health facility under the management of district health centers (DHC) and CHS s taff are public servant. The MoH has collaborated with the Ministry of Home Affairs to issue a circular guiding the functions, tasks, powers and organizational structure of DoH which are managed by the People's Committees of provinces and centrally - run cit ies and Health Offices which are managed by District People's Committees; to issue a circular guiding the functions and tasks of CHS as the basis for unified vertical management and direction. Currently, 100% of provinces and cities have a food safety agen cy and a population and family planning agency under the DoH; 100% of districts have a Health Office; 60/63 provinces consider DHC as units under DoH 16 ; ; 60/63 provinces consider CHS as technical units under DHC 17 ; 62/63 provinces (except for Ho Chi Minh c ity) ha ve established Population and Family Planning Centers at district level, in which 46 provinces consider them as units under the provincial population and family planning agency and 16 provinces consider them as units under District People's Committe es ; 03 /63 provinces have established F ood S afety C enter s at district level. The network of public health facilities has been widely developed, 100% of communes/wards/towns have active health staff, only 1% of communes do not have their own CHS and have to borrow facilities to operate their health care activities . The model of family 16 Ho Chi Minh city, Thai Binh province and Binh Phuoc province consider DHC as units under D istrict People's Committees 17 Lao Cai, H o a Binh and Quang Binh provinces consider CHS as units under Health Offices 18 doctor clinic was launched in 2013 18 and has obtain ed initial achievements after two years with 240 clinic s being established. Health inspection has undergone changes regarding legal regulations and network organization in line with the Decree no. 122/2014/ND - CP and Decision No 2176/QD - TTg. The M oH and localities have conducted series of thematic inspection to find out shortcomings as a foundation for consolidation of the manageme nt and execution of health activities. The M oH has promulgated criteria and tools to improve quality of inspection and supervision of health facilities 19 , promote d the operation of hotline s to receive comments and feedback of the people . Shortcomings and li mitations: Health policies are not issued timely , are overlapped and inconsistent. Collaboration between stakeholders are limited, there lack information and reliable evidence for health policy development. The effects and effectiveness of health policies fall below expectations, especially mas ter plans and work plans with unidentified resources for implement ation ; there lack detailed plans and information to translate policies into practice . There lacks the link between planning and budgeting by priority area ; budget planning is mainly based on input indicators (e.g. human resources, population). The health system is unstable with many focal points and inconsistency, especially at grassroots level, causing insufficient human resources, increased administr ative expenditures and low effectiveness. Health facilities are managed by administra tive boundary, which discourages the development and upgrade of hospitals . There is no i ncentive mechanism to encourage and strengthen the linkage and collabora tion betwee n health facilities at the same level and across levels to assure the continuity of service provision. The h ealth inspection network is weak in quality and quantity . The supervisory roles and capacity of political, social and professional organizations a re limited. Administrative reform in the health sector is imlemented but not very eff ective due to failing to meet requirements of Public Administration Reform Index (PAR INDEX) . 18 The project \" Building and development o f the model of family doctor clinics in Vietnam for 2013 - 2020\" was launched in accordance with Decision No. 935/ QD - BYT dated 11/3/2013 of the Health Minister 19 E.g. the set of criteria for hospital quality assessment, national criteria for commune health i n the period 2011 - 2020 19 PART 2 PLAN FOR PEOPLE'S HEALTH PROTECTION , CARE AND IMPROVEMENT IN THE PE RIOD 2016 - 2020 1. Opportunities and challenges The 5 - y ear Health Plan 2016 - 2020 will be implemented in the context when our country continues to promote the comprehensive and systematic reform process as well as develop a firm foundation for quickly turn ing the country into a modern industrial ized nation, with many interwoven opportunities and challenges. 1.1. Opportunities - Policies of the Party, the National Assembly and the Government keep affirming the important role of people's health care in the process of achieving social advancement and equity, improving people's life and meeting requirements of industrialization a nd modernization of the country; and consider that investment in health is a direct investment for sustainable development . - The leg islation system relating to health care is gradually elaborated; many Laws, Decrees of the Government, Decisions of the Prime Minister, guiding Circulars of m inistries were issued, creating a clear and transparent legal framework for the building and dev el opment of the health system . - The n ati o n a l econ o m y continues to d e v elo p in stable political - economic conditions ; there have been positive changes in rural areas in Vietnam creating favorable conditions for guaranteeing social security and investment in health. - Globalization and in ternational integration create opportunities for Vietnamese goods and workers in general and in the health sector in particular to penetrate the world mar ket, people have more options for quality health services in the countr y. Traffic infrastructure is upgraded, modern means of communication are developed, facilitating people to get access to health facilities and to health knowledge. - Awareness and participation of the people, the party committees and authorities at all lev els in health care are improved widely and deeply; inter - sectoral collaboration in health care is increasingly widespread and effective . 1.2. Challenges - Regarding socio - economic factors , the difference in per capita income between regions and population groups is big ; the poverty rate remains high , especially in ethnic minority areas, along with many backward practices lead ing to un equal health , the burden of disease and limited access to health care services . The cost s of health care are growing while ou r country is still a poor one , investment in health care is low and foreign aid to Vietnam has been decreasing . Beside opportunities, globalization and international integration also create challenges for the social economy in general and the health sector in particular , e.g. management of the practice of foreign - invested health facilities and foreign health workers in Vietnam; competition between domestic and foreign production of goods and delivery of health services; the risk of brain drain 20 from the heal th sector of Vietnam to other countries in the region; increased risk of epidemics , especially the emerging ones . Remuneration for health workers is unreasonable, wages and allowances for them are low and not commensurate with their study and performance w hereas their working conditions are hard, especially in mountainous and rural areas. - Regarding demographics, our population is big and continues to grow . Vietnam is one of the ten coun tries with the most rapid aging rate in the world; SRB imbalance remai ns high; migration has not been well controlled, creat ing big pressure for the health system. - As for natural environmental factors, Vietnam is one of the six countries bear ing the greatest impact of climate change and is one of the five countries with th e highest disaster risk s in the world. Environmental pollution becomes increasingly seri ous, especially due to the fast urbanization . F ood contamination due to the use of banned chemicals in aquaculture and food processing remains a persistent problem that has not been effectively controlled. - In terms of behavioral factors and lifestyle, the impact of negative factors such as smoking, abuse of alcohol , d rug use , prostitution , improper diet , lack of physical activities, etc . on health is increasing. 2. Objectives 2 .1. Overall objective To reduce morbidity and mortality rates caused by diseases and epidemics, contribute to improving people's life expectancy and core health indicators ; t o enhance capacity and performance of the health system, to creat e a solid foundation for the development of an equi table, effective , quality and sustainab le health system , meeting people's health care needs in the course of industrialization and modernization. 2.2.

Health core indicators The list of health core indicators proposed to be included the national 5 - year and annual socio - economic development plan s consists of 16 indicators (see detail s in Annex 2 ), of which the following two indicators are assigned by the National Assembly and the Prime Minister : ( 1) The number of hospital beds per 10,000 p opulation ; ( 2) HI coverage . The remaining indicators are assigned by the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) as authorized by the Prime Ministe r . Besides , this plan for people's health protection, care and promotion in 2016 - 2020 also introduces indicators and targets to assess the overall performance of the health sector , the implementation of health - related MDGs and targeted program s (see detai ls in Annex 3) . 4.
