Our longest-running partnership is with North Dallas Shared Ministries, an interfaith community of volunteers, partners and collaborators providing charitable assistance to people in need. Since 2006, our student-run clinic has provided free medical care to low- income residents in 24 Dallas zip codes. Community Health will soon be partnering with The Nexus Recovery Center, a nonprofit organization that helps women overcome substance and alcohol abuse. We will be providing services to these patients, many of whom are pregnant or have children, and haven't had access to a family doctor. C O M M U N I T Y H E A L T H Address the health care needs of inner-city, at-risk, and underserved patients Obtain real-world clinical experience treating patients under the direction of a mentor Gain applied research knowledge through a combination of classroom training and a community health agency-based research projectThis year marked 18 years of the Community Health Fellowship Program (CHFP). This popular program ran from June 7 to August 6 this year and introduced first-year medical students to community-based participatory research and emphasized the importance of collaboration in addressing community health problems in underserved communities. The goal of CHFP is to help community- based organizations identify the needs of those they serve, investigate how well those needs are being met, and provide information that can be used to obtain and coordinate additional resources. Projects benefit the participating organization while teaching medical students the value of collaboration to achieve optimal health outcomes among underserved communities. The program gives students an opportunity to:Community Health Fellowship ProgramCommunity Health Partnerships Parker Brady studied the impact of health literacy in youth aging out of foster care. William Burton worked with a community clinic to provide free blood pressure monitors to low-income patients. Samantha Mendoza matched human trafficking victims to crisis health care at a community clinic. Hannah Miller studied the impact on student food selections at a Montessori school.Maria Rodriguez screened patients and their relatives for familial hypercholesterolemia at a community clinic. Narda Salinas worked to identify the needs, barriers, and resources in Dallas to better care for children in immigrant families who are uninsured or underinsured. CHFP students also visited local organizations to learn about opportunities to work with the underserved community, including North Dallas Shared Ministries (see above), The Bridge, Cafe' Momentum, and the Downtown Dallas Inc. outreach team.CHFP Projects Department of Family and Community Medicine 5 Page 6 50.9% self-reported a pre-pandemic mental health illness diagnosis. Over one-fourth required additional treatment for their mental health during the pandemic and 8.5% felt they needed more treatment but could not access or afford treatment. About half expressed more than a minimal severity of symptoms of anxiety (48.4%) and depression (51.3%) at the time of the survey. Those participants with a pre- COVID-19 pandemic depression screening score of 2 or more had significantly higher symptoms of anxiety and depression compared to those with a negative depression screening. During the pandemic, overall anxiety symptoms changed but remained mild in severity, but depressive symptoms increased from mild to moderate in severity. COVID-19 related stressors were positively and moderately associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms. There was no significant difference between nonessential and essential workers in terms of anxiety and depression. Based on this study, it appears that COVID-19-related stressors impact symptoms of anxiety and depression among our primary care patients. Gathering information from patients about the stressors in their lives and offering support services, such as behavioral health care, is important for primary care physicians. Likewise, we should remain vigilant in our assessment of patients with pre-existing depressive symptoms, as they may be at more risk for worsening mood symptoms during the pandemic. In the future, we hope to continue to understand how this pandemic has impacted patients' lives over time to better inform the care we provide. R E S E A R C H & P U B L I C A T I O N S - C O V I D - 1 9 Dr. Emily Levy Kamugisha recently led an unfunded study about the impact of Covid-19 on the mental health of patients in the clinic. Here is her description of the study and its findings: Title: The Effects of COVID-Related Stressors on Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms During the COVID-19 Pandemic The COVID-19 pandemic brought on rapid changes to society that resulted in new stressors on the health and well- being of individuals and communities. After noting increased rates of anxiety and depressive symptoms among our primary care patients, I began wondering how family physicians and behavioral health clinicians could better identify those at risk for anxiety and depression during the pandemic. In collaboration with multiple faculty members and residents in our department, we sought to better understand the impacts of COVID-19 on the mental health of our patients. Our goal was to assess whether a pre- COVID-19 pandemic depression screening score (PHQ-2) was a predictor for mental health distress during the pandemic. Secondary outcomes included evaluating whether COVID-related stressors, such as loss of a job, being an essential worker, or caring for dependents, were associated with an increase in severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms. We recruited 118 adult participants from our three UTSW Family Medicine clinics to complete a one-time survey. We used the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) to measure anxiety and depressive symptoms. Of those surveyed, 13.8% had personally been diagnosed with COVID-19, 62.1% had a family member or friend with COVID-19, and 21.6% had a family member or friend die from COVID-19. Although a majority of participants (83.9%) had a baseline PHQ-2 score of < 2 (considered a negative screen), Covid-19 Mental Health Study Caring for a Loved One With Cancer During the Pandemic In the article \"Incidental Connection: Cancer and Caregiving During COVID- 19\", Dr. Sarah Woods explores the connection between a life-changing cancer diagnosis and the societywide upheaval caused by COVID-19. She describes her experience with her husband Jesse during his diagnosis and treatment for mesothelioma during the height of the pandemic. Each stage of the illness aligned with a new stage of the pandemic. Dr. Woods found herself in the position of having to advocate for her husband from a distance during his treatments and final surgery. Dealing with a cancer diagnosis and treatment comes with its unique share of stress, but this was compounded by COVID-19. Woods, S.B. (2021).

The following is an excerpt from an online article by Anna Fader posted on the \"Mommy Poppins\" blog, with contributions from Gwen Glazer. M O N T H L Y C O L U M N S \"My interest in osteopathic manipulative therapy (OMT) began when I first learned what osteopathy is. It was right before applying to medical school; a college buddy of mine recommended applying to a D.O program because the curriculum had more of a holistic approach, plus we had the opportunity to heal people with our hands. I found that to be a win-win situation, so I applied to a D.O. school in Texas. I didn't really know exactly what OMT is, and it's hard to explain it until you're either doing it or you've had it done to you. OMT is a hands-on approach to alleviating any ailments in the body. Specifically, OMT targets the fascia of our body, which is a type of connective tissue that spans from head to toe. Our fascia is interconnected, so it's common that an injury or trauma to one area of the body can affect other parts of the body as well. I've been practicing OMT for about six years now and have easily treated thousands of patients thus far. I've used OMT in just about every rotation in residency - from adults to pediatrics to OB patients and their newborns. The list of issues I've used OMT for includes headaches, muscle aches/pain, sinus issues, numbness/tingling in arms/legs, TMJ (jaw tightness), lymphatic drainage, post-surgery complications including pain, etc. Unfortunately, what I've come to realize during residency is the lack of awareness and utilization of such a beneficial resource. Most patients and colleagues agree that such a noninvasive and hands- on approach is appropriate in treating many different problems. My goal is to continue to spread awareness amongst my colleagues and my patients, so that many more people can benefit from OMT.\"Welcome to a new column in which we will focus on different topics related to integrative medicine.
