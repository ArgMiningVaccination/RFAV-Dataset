Attracted in his youth to the works of [Goethe](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Johann-Wolfgang-von-Goethe), Steiner edited that poet's scientific works and from 1889 to 1896 worked on the standard edition of his complete works at Weimar. During this period he wrote his Die Philosophie der Freiheit (1894; \"The Philosophy of Freedom\"), then moved to Berlin to edit the literary journal Magazin f\u00fcr Literatur and to lecture. Coming gradually to believe in spiritual [perception](https://www.britannica.com/topic/perception) independent of the senses, he called the result of his research \"anthroposophy,\" centring on \"knowledge produced by the higher self in man.\" In 1912 he founded the [Anthroposophical Society](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Anthroposophical-Society). Steiner believed that humans once participated more fully in spiritual processes of the world through a dreamlike [consciousness](https://www.britannica.com/topic/consciousness) but had since become restricted by their attachment to material things. The renewed perception of spiritual things required training the human [consciousness](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/consciousness) to rise above attention to matter. The ability to achieve this goal by an exercise of the intellect is theoretically innate in everyone. In 1913 at Dornach, near [Basel](https://www.britannica.com/place/Basel-Switzerland), [Switzerland](https://www.britannica.com/place/Switzerland), Steiner built his first Goetheanum, which he characterized as a \"school of spiritual science.\" After a fire in 1922, it was replaced by another building. The [Waldorf School](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Waldorf-school) movement, derived from his experiments with the Goetheanum, by the early 21st century had more than 1,000 schools around the world. Other projects that grew out of Steiner's work include [communities](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/communities) for persons with disabilities; a therapeutic clinical centre at Arlesheim, Switzerland; scientific and mathematical research centres; and schools of drama, speech, painting, and sculpture. Among Steiner's varied writings are The Philosophy of Spiritual Activity (1894), Occult Science: An Outline (1913), and Story "}
