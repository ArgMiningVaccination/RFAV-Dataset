Ultimately, she states that, if we elevate our understanding of cleaning, we might even begin to enjoy it!\"Initially I thought this book would just present a slightly different approach to cleaning than that of all of the organizing books out there, and to a certain extent I was correct. But it is also so much more. Linda Thomas presents a rich collection of information on the historical, cultural and spiritual aspects of cleaning, and weaves them together into something quite humbling and thought provoking. She completely deconstructs the stereotypes that view the work of cleaning as demeaning, and shows how powerful and important such work actually is. Thomas has received a fair amount of criticism for chapters of her book that explore such topics as elemental beings and how they aid or hamper cleaning efforts. She also refers regularly to the work and beliefs of Austrian philosopher Rudolph Steiner, who founded the esoteric spiritual movement, anthroposophy. Some of these portions of the book were a bit rough for me, but I did find value in them and would not dismiss the book because of them. As to criticism that the book is not actually about cleaning, I would have to disagree. In addition to the more esoteric information in the book, there is plenty of practical advice, examples, and strategies.In all, I found Thomas's book to be a valuable and thought-provoking read. I particularly enjoyed her cultural review of cleaning traditions, and absolutely loved how she reframes the traditional definition of meaningful work and demeaning work. I originally read this as an ebook but have decided it is valuable enough to me to purchase a hard copy for my small \"real\" library. Book preview Why Cleaning Has Meaning - Linda Thomas 1. How I Came into Cleaning and Caring South Africa to Switzerland Until one is committed, there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back, always ineffectiveness. Concerning all acts of initiative (and creation), there is one elementary truth that ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans: that the moment one definitely commits oneself, then Providence moves too. All sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise have occurred. A whole stream of events issues from the decision, raising in one's favor all manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance, which no man could have dreamt would have come his way. I learned a deep respect for one of Goethe's couplets: 'Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it.' William Hutchison Murray (1913-96)\u00b9 Years before I even thought of writing a book, I found this quote on a desk in a house I was cleaning. It moved me because it confirmed so much of what had happened in my life. The very person whose house I was busy cleaning was a woman who has had a profound influence in my life. Because of her, I was offered the possibility of cleaning the Goetheanum. She was the one who organised the first interview that was ever published on my work. Through her, providence has moved many times in my life. But let me start at the beginning. Why did I start cleaning? This most menial of tasks still fills me with awe, just thinking of the incredible potential it has to change things. Most of what I have learned in life, I learned through my children. Most of the things I have really understood in life came to me through over twenty years of experience as a professional cleaner. As a young girl, I had one ideal only and that was to become a housewife and mother: full-time. But as so often in life, destiny took a turn in another direction. I was born in 1953 in a very small village in South Africa, as the middle child of seven siblings. We lived in many different places, but what remains most strongly in my memory is a smallholding in a very poor farming community, where we lived on and off from my fourth until my fourteenth year. I often heard children talking about only primitive people having such large families. When confronting my father with this, he simply replied, 'Primitive people do not look after themselves and their surroundings, they live in dirt, and no longer have any dignity or sense of human values.' This reply made a deep impression on me. As we were very poor, my father taught us that the only capital we possessed, and could rely on, was our intelligence, ability and willingness to work. It became very clear that there would never be any money for studies and that those of us who wished to go to university would have to obtain a scholarship through our own diligence. We lived off the land and we all learned to help at a very tender age. We learned to plant and care for vegetables, we could harvest and process fruit, cook, bake, sew and mend our own clothes - yet we never learned how to clean. We neither had to make our own beds, nor clean our own shoes. For during the apartheid era even the poorest of white people had servants, as the black people were often even poorer than we were. At fourteen years of age, I experienced a cultural shock. We moved from our small provincial town to Johannesburg, a big hostile city without nature. In our small community we had all been treated as individuals but now, from one day to the next, we were somehow anonymous, just one among many. Although all my brothers and sisters worked hard to go to university, I knew that I wanted to be a wife and mother of a large family, preferably on a small farm. I did not require a diploma to do this and therefore had no interest in further study. The sad fact that I was unable to find a suitable husband directly after leaving school meant that I was obliged to look for work. I found a job in a bank. There I met a Swiss man who was to become my future husband. Two days after our wedding in February 1977, we left for Switzerland. Our intention was to stay for one year in order to prepare for my husband's emigration so that we could settle in South Africa. On my very first day in Switzerland, I came across the books of Omraam Mikha\u00ebl A\u00efvanhov (1900-1986), the Bulgarian philosopher and mystic. He was to have a profound influence on my life. Discovering a spiritual teaching was such a liberating experience after the strict, Puritan Dutch Reformed Church I had known in South Africa. I felt the strong conviction that to be able to learn from this great teacher was much more important than going back to South Africa. Now, thirty-five years later, I am still living in Switzerland. Very soon after arriving in Basle, I met a doctor who was about ten years older than my mother. We became close friends and in many ways she took on a maternal role in my life. I was particularly impressed with her talented son and daughter, then aged fourteen and sixteen. Every time I admired a piece of art, be it a painting, a wooden or clay sculpture, or even the copper baking forms in the kitchen, it was made by either her son or her daughter. They also both played musical instruments, and during conversations I was most impressed by their wide general knowledge. I complimented my friend on being such a wonderful mother, having educated her children to be so multi-talented. To this she simply replied, 'Of course I try my best, but I am also much indebted to the school they go to.' They were such wonderful young people that I knew that whatever school it was, there had to be something very special about it. And this is how I learned about the existence of Waldorf or Rudolf Steiner Schools. After visiting a school bazaar a few weeks later, I was convinced that this would be the only kind of school good enough for my future children who, as it turned out, were in no hurry to come. My daughter was born in 1982 and my son five years later. Ten years after my first encounter with the school, my daughter was ready to go to kindergarten. I told my husband that I would like her to go to the Waldorf kindergarten. He considered this a luxury and was quite happy to send her to a 'good state school,' and said, 'If you want to send her to a private school you'll have to finance it yourself.' He quite underestimated the strength of my conviction. Cleaning company and crisis My son was only a few months old at the time, and I had no idea what I could do. Before my daughter was born I had worked as an executive secretary for an American company in Basle, but I had no desire to return to such a highly stressful job which would take too much of my time away from my children. A friend of mine, whose three children also went to the Waldorf School, advised me to try to start my own business. She suggested, 'Why don't you start a cleaning company, honestly committed to using only environmentally friendly products. There is no such service available and I'm sure there would be a demand.' This was very much a win-win situation, as my friend had a small factory making ecological cleaning products and detergents. I became enthused by the idea. Without a moment of hesitation, I knew that I had found my calling and immediately got to work searching for information as to how to go about it. Wanting to be a professional cleaning woman was not the easiest thing to do. I had hardly any cleaning experience at all. On our farm in South Africa we had servants. The men worked on the land and their wives did the cleaning and washing for a bag of flour and sugar and a few old pieces of old clothing. The men built a bungalow for their families and were able to use a piece of land to cultivate their own vegetables. If the farmer could afford it, they would receive a few chickens and perhaps a goat to milk. Starting a cleaning company made me feel like an explorer on a quest. In the very beginning, I was not only the 'boss', I was bookkeeper, secretary, the only employee, as well as apprentice. I had so much to learn, not only about starting a business, but also about the right equipment and cleaning agents to be used. To clean a gym hall you would need quite a different kind of broom than what you would use in your kitchen. Then there was the question of employees, benefits and insurance; I had no idea how to tender for a job, not even what prices I could charge. After six months of extensive research and preparation I was offered my first regular contract in March 1988 - it was a Waldorf School. It was not quite as easy as I had imagined it all to be. At the time, cleaning was not my vocation, and nor did I have a natural talent for it. Contrary to what many people imagine, I discovered it was a highly specialised profession, and I also had a lot to learn about people. In addition, it was very important to learn how to conserve my strength, how to protect myself from physical injury as well as from the effects of the atmosphere in the rooms I cleaned. Most of all, I had to learn how to respect the space of other people, how to work in that space and to enter it in a non-judgmental way. When you clean professionally, you enter a whole new world. What I found hardest to cope with was the indifference I met, the lack of commitment and sometimes even respect. People addressed me in a very familiar way and sometimes men tried to take liberties they would not dream of in another setting. Cleaning can also be a very lonely activity. We cleaning people are often by ourselves when we do our job. Many mothers experience the same kind of loneliness when they are busy with their daily household chores. During the first years of business, I worked mainly with mothers in a similar situation to mine, whose children were more or less the same ages. One of these mothers had to finance her driver's licence, another wanted to buy a piano for the family. Whenever we had a large project, four or five mothers would go out to work, while one stayed at home with all our children. She received the same pay as the mothers who went out cleaning. This was a very special time for all of us. We all had the same attitude to our work and were fired by our ideals. Yet, at some point the piano was bought, the driver's licence obtained, the children started going to school and the need for babysitters became less of a problem. The mothers dropped away, and after about five years, the structure of the company underwent a complete change. I started working mainly with students who had time during the summer holidays and who needed money to finance their studies. Indifference About six months after I started my cleaning company, I had a profound identity crisis. Being confronted with the lack of respect was more difficult to handle than I imagined. The constant indifference I encountered was hurtful. Although the clients knew that I was coming to clean, nothing was picked up. I sometimes had the feeling it was done on purpose. As soon as one cleans for a living, people tend to think that one either cannot do anything else, or that one is in desperate need of money. At this time I often had the impression that people did not quite know how to act with me. Outside in the parking lot they would greet me, and even stay for a chat, yet once I was inside the school building wearing my cleaner's coat and pushing my cleaning cart, they reacted quite differently. The same people seemed to be ill at ease. I was not embarrassed, yet some people did not even bother to greet me. All the other people in the hallway would be greeted, yet the people cleaning were not worthy of a greeting. Sometimes I had the feeling that we were invisible. I even wondered if we were avoided because we reminded people that we were doing something that had very much to do with each and every one of them. Please do not get me wrong. I have nothing against being employed to clean or other people employing a cleaner. On the contrary, I find it quite important that people who do not like to clean, or are too busy to do it, should employ others to do so. Without the opportunity to clean for others, I would never have gained the experience I have today. Yet I do find it interesting that the very people who employ us to clean for them often seem to have more reservations about it than we who do the job. A lack of commitment A lady once asked me if I would clean her house on a weekly basis. Her husband travelled a lot, and besides their three children, they also had a lot of animals living in the house. She hoped that, as a professional person, I would be able to handle this job, as the many other people she had employed before me never seemed to last longer than a month. I took a good look at the house and we agreed that I would clean every Wednesday from 2 till 6 pm. I was very surprised to find the house in total chaos when I arrived for the first time. The lady was out, dirty dishes from at least three days were standing around and the floor was covered with everything imaginable. I could not believe my eyes. In almost all the rooms there were dirty dishes, sometimes even with leftovers. I started by picking up everything that was lying on the floor and by the time I finished all the dishes, two hours had passed. The lady arrived about five minutes before I was to leave and was most vexed that I had not been able to clean the whole house as agreed. I did point out that the agreement clearly stated cleaning, not picking up or washing dishes. She tried to argue, but I was quite adamant. When I turned up the next week to find the house in exactly the same state as before, I left the key in the mailbox and simply went home. The lack of commitment with regard to the environment is something I find quite alarming and disturbing. Surely most adults today are aware of the impact of pollution, yet many do very little or nothing at all to improve matters. It is quite amazing to see the kind of very aggressive cleaning and personal hygiene products there are in many homes and institutions I visit. One of the most common excuses is that eco friendly products are either too expensive or not efficient enough. This is either ignorance or quite simply not wanting to try something new. After cleaning professionally for over twenty years, I very rarely resort to a non-ecological product. There was a time when I cleaned in the early hours of the morning while my family was at home sleeping. This is something that countless people do every day of their lives. To me it was new, and I only did it because at that time I could not afford any childcare. As soon as I put the children to bed, I would also go to sleep. Then at about midnight I would get up and go to clean the school until about five in the morning, allowing me to get back before my children and husband woke up. This school was slightly isolated and at first I would go through the whole school to make sure all windows were closed and that there was no one hiding anywhere. I found that during this time my sense of hearing became much more acute. Everything was so quiet, and sometimes I had the experience, cleaning this big school all by myself in the middle of the night, that I could almost hear the rooms speaking to me. I learned to distinguish the quality of a sound. Was it threatening or reassuring? In winter, for instance, when the heating system would come on with a shuddering sound at about four in the morning, I would know that it was just about time to go home. Three questions While walking up and down long corridors during these nightly hours of service, I discovered that I had a lot of time to think. I tried to understand the deeper meaning of the work I was doing, as my thoughts searched for something beyond my immediate deeds and actions. I also remembered things I had heard and learned before, but which now took on a completely new meaning. I found myself asking, is this really what I want to do for years to come? Am I willing to carry on picking up after strangers, cleaning away other people's dirt, and putting up with their indifference as I try to render a service? Three questions arose while I cleaned: How am I going to handle this indifference, the lack of respect and commitment of others? What effect does the state of a room have on people? What changes am I able to bring about in a room, through my own activity of caring for the space? Regarding the second question, I experienced rooms as very different and often wondered what effect a specific classroom would have on the children who had to learn there. Does the condition of a bedroom influence the child who sleeps there? What about an office or a therapy room? Every word spoken in a room, every thought, every feeling, every moment of passion, or every smoked cigarette leaves traces in a room. Some of what lives in a room we might wish to conserve; but would other influences be better discarded or transformed? Pondering the third question, could my work positively influence the room and the activity which would take place in it? These questions were crucial to me. Through living with these questions, a space was created that, little by little, made it possible for the answers to come. The most important question, of course, was the first one. The answer to it came in the form of a sentence which I had either heard or read somewhere: if you are not able to do what you love, you should try to learn to love what you do. A good thought, but much easier said than done. I could hand a student her trolley, show her twenty toilets with the request, 'Please clean all these toilets, and make sure you love what you do.' This is impossible! Changing our attitude towards what we do has to rise from the innermost part of our being. Nobody can tell us how to do it. A legend I had heard a long time ago helped me discover how I could learn to love cleaning. In a monastery, there lived a monk who was given all the menial tasks, such as washing the dishes, sweeping and scrubbing the floors, and so on. He did not mind this, and did all his chores lovingly, always reciting little prayers while doing his work. 'Dear God, as I wash this dish, please send one of your angels to wash my heart and make it pure.' Or 'Dear God, as I clean this floor, please send one of your angels to accompany me, that every person who walks on this floor may be touched by your presence.' For every chore, he had a prayer, and he continued working in this way for a great many years. Then, one morning, he woke up enlightened. From then on people came from far and wide to listen to his wisdom. This story reminded me of an experience I had as a child. On our little farm we had paraffin lamps, and if the glass was not cleaned every day, the light of the flame would hardly shine through. This, I thought, is what must have happened to the monk in the legend. With so many angels cleaning and scrubbing at him over so many years, it was inevitable that his wisdom would shine through his whole being. This was when I understood that everything we do also reflects on our inner being. Another memory that came back to me was that my grandmother came to stay with us on the farm after my grandfather had died in an accident. My mother called my three elder sisters and me and explained that our grandmother was very sad and that she cried a lot. We could comfort her by taking turns to make her bed for her every morning. As we had never made our own beds, my mother took us to grandmother's room and showed us exactly how to make the bed. In those days there were no duvets and we had to take great care to fold the linen sheets and the blankets in just the right way, so that the corners would look perfect and the top sheet was folded back to show the embroidery. Most important of all, she explained, was the pillow. Mother took it to the window and showed us how to shake it vigorously and tap it thoroughly so that all grandmother's pain, her tears and her sadness would fly away with the wind. We then had to place the pillow back and smooth it, gently saying a little prayer for grandmother, that she may be comforted when she laid her head down to rest. I was almost five years old then and I had forgotten this experience for thirty odd years, only to remember it now, while I lived with the challenge of how to learn to love cleaning. Not only the memory of making the bed came back to me, but also the feeling of absolute devotion with which I did it. As a small child, I considered this a sacred chore and I poured my whole energy into this act of comfort I was to do for my grandmother. And now, as a reminiscing cleaner, I knew with total conviction that if only once I could experience this sense of loving devotion while doing my work, would I really learn to love cleaning. I started doing things in this way. In the beginning, it was merely an exercise which I did faithfully, trying to be very aware of everything I did. I tried to shake something out of certain objects, wipe away or sweep something out. Working with total awareness and devotion was like an act of survival and it gave me something to hold on to. Through repetition it turned into a necessity, and I started to discover the deeper meaning of what I was doing. I realised that I actually began to draw strength from my work. This newly found strength filled me with profound gratitude, and with this feeling of gratitude I discovered for the first time in months that I was able to experience joy. The longer I did my work with this attitude, the more strongly I was able to feel part of what I was doing. But the most important thing of all was that it enriched my being, my spirit, and this could never be taken away. Many months later, as I was cleaning my daughter's kindergarten as a "}
