All they see is a person who is not in control. But now you can hear me. The iPad helps me to see not only my words, but to hold onto my thoughts.\" The commercial was surprising because this system of \"facilitated communication\" (FC) was thoroughly discredited in the 1990s. Facilitators had used plastic alphabet keyboards or portable typing devices, and in various videos\u2014for example, the 1993 Frontline episode \" [Prisoners of Silence](https://youtu.be/CzCGux7qD1c)\"\u2014 you see children who are not even looking at the keyboard as facilitators direct their typing or facilitators moving the keyboard under a child's hand to produce the proper keystrokes. The technique was an academic curiosity until FC-generated messages included graphic descriptions of sexual abuse by families or caretakers of numerous children. Charges and lawsuits were filed, and courts needed scientists to determine who authored the accusations\u2014the children or the facilitators? Howard Shane, now director of the Autism Language Program at Boston Children's Hospital, and Doug Wheeler, then at the O. D. Heck Developmental Center in Schenectady, N.Y., conducted independent controlled experiments in which autistic children and their facilitators were shown pictures of either the same or different objects while blinded to what each other saw. What was typed was always and only what the facilitator saw. Since then, as Emory University psychologist (and Scientific American Mind adviser) Scott O. Lilienfeld, an expert on pseudoscience in psychology and psychiatry, told Emory's eScienceCommons blog, dozens of controlled studies have unequivocally concluded that FC \"doesn't work.\" Worse, \"the false hope buoyed by discredited therapies can be cruel, and it may prevent people from trying an intervention that actually could deliver benefits.\" In a 2014 paper Lilienfeld co-wrote with Shane and others on \"The Persistence of Fad Interventions in the Face of Negative Scientific Evidence\" in Evidence-Based Communication Assessment and Intervention, a list of failed autism treatments included gluten-free diets, antifungal interventions, chelation therapy, nicotine patches, testosterone, marijuana, camel milk, weighted vests, magnetic shoe inserts and even bleach enemas.

Modern medicine deals in probabilities and informed guesses based on scientific evidence. Complimentary and alternative medicine (CAM) deals in certainties based on fantasy and intuition. Harriet Hall, M.D. reminds us that, although modern medicine is riddled with uncertainty, it's still far better than any other option. This article appeared in [Skeptic magazine 18.4](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/18.4/) (2013). [Read Harriet Hall's bio](https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/uncertainty-in-medicine/#bio) at the end of this article. Uncertainty in Medicine by Harriet Hall, M.D. One of the reasons I went into medicine was the na\u00efve idea that doctors always know what to do. I was wrong. Marya Zilberberg got it right when she said, \"The only certain thing about medicine is uncertainty.\" Patient histories are uncertain, physical exams are uncertain, tests are uncertain, diagnoses are uncertain, treatments are uncertain, even human anatomy is uncertain. Doctors are not scientists; they are practical users of science who apply scientific evidence to patient care. Medicine deals in probabilities and informed guesses, not certainties. Symptoms can mean many things. They can be a sign of serious illness requiring treatment, an illness we don't yet know how to identify and treat, a benign condition that will resolve without treatment, a hyper-awareness of normal bodily functions, depression, somatization disorder, malingering, or a cry for help. The patient's account of his symptoms and medical history is uncertain. Memory is unreliable. We forget, we distort, and we remember things that never happened. Patients want to present themselves in a good light; they tend to underestimate their alcohol and tobacco use and hesitate to mention sexual indiscretions and foolish use of nonsensical remedies. Their answers to \"how much pain on a scale of 1 to 10\" depend on variables such as their current mood and their degree of stoicism. Doctors do a \"review of systems\" (often by a printed questionnaire) asking about symptoms in different body systems (respiratory, gastrointestinal, etc.). Answers will depend on how significant the patient thinks the symptoms are. One patient may answer \"no\" to heartburn because he thinks his heartburn is not worth mentioning; another may say \"yes\" because he remembers he had a mild burning sensation for about 2 minutes once last month. Physical exams are uncertain. It's easy to miss an abnormality like an enlarged spleen unless you suspect it and try hard to find it. Even anatomy is uncertain. Some people have reversed organs (situs inversus), where the heart is on the right and the appendix on the left. Some are missing a kidney. The location of blood vessels and nerves is variable. Look at the veins on the back of your hands; they're not in exactly the same place on each hand. Even something as apparently straightforward as the obstetrician's announcement \"It's a boy!\" can be wrong. In my recent article on gender differences (\"Gender Differences: What Science Says and Why It's Mostly Wrong\" in [Skeptic 18.2](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/18.2/)) I listed five determinants of biological sex in a newborn (sex chromosomes, gonads, hormones, internal genitalia, and external genitalia) and the many ways in which each of these can go wrong. Other factors later in life contribute to classification of sex and gender: development of secondary sexual characteristics at puberty, the sex the person was reared as, gender self-identification, object of desire, behavior, dress, role in society, and legal gender.

Myths about Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity and Multiple Chemical Sensitivity by Harriet Hall, M.D. As if we didn't have enough things to worry about already, now we are being told to fear our toasters. A typical headline trumpets \" [The Effects of Invisible Waves](http://www.womenscollegehospital.ca/news-and-events/connect/the-effects-of-invisible-waves).\" We are increasingly exposed to electromagnetic radiation from cell phones, cell phone towers, wireless Internet routers, cordless phones, and power lines. Other sources [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_hypersensitivity), [2](http://www.nontoxic.com/electromagnetic/electromagnetic.htm) are our household appliances: TVs, hairdryers, light bulbs, and yes, your trusty toaster. These invisible villains are said to lead to a variety of symptoms, including poor sleep, fatigue, heart palpitations, headache, nausea, dizziness, memory impairment, prickling and burning sensations, along with skin rashes. They've even been blamed for depression, anxiety, colds, digestive disorders, and chronic pain. It's called electromagnetic hypersensitivity or EHS. Is EHS physical or psychological? Research is problematic because there is no universally accepted definition of the condition. The array of symptoms is reminiscent of the symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome, Gulf War syndrome, fibromyalgia, somatization disorder, anxiety, and simple stress.

It has proved difficult to show under blind conditions that exposure to EMF can trigger these symptoms. This suggests that \"electromagnetic hypersensitivity\" is unrelated to the presence of EMF. Such claims don't hold up under scrutiny. A [2005 review](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15784787) in the Psychosomatic Medicine journal identified 31 blinded provocation experiments done on \"electromagnetically hypersensitive\" subjects. Twenty-four studies found no evidence of sensitivity. Seven studies did report some supporting evidence, but in two of them the same research group tried to replicate their own findings and failed; in three others, the positive findings could be attributed to statistical artifacts; and in the remaining two the results were mutually incompatible (one showed improved mood; the other showed worse mood). Studies that were not blinded all found that the patients reported symptoms only when they were aware that the EMF (electromagnetic field) source was switched on. The implication is obvious. The researchers noted: The symptoms described by \"electromagnetic hypersensitivity\" sufferers can be severe and are sometimes disabling. However, it has proved difficult to show under blind conditions that exposure to EMF can trigger these symptoms.

Fans mourned his coming demise, but to everyone's astonishment, Magic's life continued in relative normalcy. A quarter of a century later he is an active entrepreneur, business leader, philanthropist and advocate for HIV/AIDS prevention. Magic's story is emblematic of one of the great medical achievements of our time. Although there is still no cure or vaccine for HIV, teams of medical researchers have developed a highly active antiretroviral therapy (the HAART \"cocktail\") that significantly slows the progression of the disease by reducing the viral load to an undetectable level. If treatment is started promptly after early detection in young adults, for example, life expectancy returns close to normal. Perhaps this is why there was far less media frenzy and social mourning after the November 2015 announcement by actor Charlie Sheen that he was HIVpositive. Most assumed HAART would save Sheen's life, not his \"tiger blood\" and \"Adonis DNA\" that he boasted about during his highly publicized 2011 meltdown following his dismissal from the hit TV series [Two and a Half Men](https://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/two-and-a-half-men-season-12/id917712685&at=10l6ex).

Not ones to surrender to popular pressure, philosophers Keith Augustine and the late Michael Martin took it upon themselves to assemble a team of 29 valiant contributors to attack the afterlife \"myth.\" The result is an impressive volume composed of 30 essays, spanning 675 pages and organized in 4 parts. Part 1 addresses \"empirical arguments for annihilation,\" i.e. \"the position that persons permanently cease to exist at biological death\" (2). As it turns out, these arguments really amount to the daily bread and butter of cognitive neuroscientists, and thus this portion of the book read like a crash-course in brain science. The \"argument from brain damage,\" for instance, uses neuropsychological evidence to show that \"the destruction of the mind by the destruction of the brain is highly probable given the hypothesis that the mind depends entirely upon the functioning of the brain, but is highly improbable given the hypothesis that the mind can exist and operate independently of the brain.\" If all brain functions have been turned off, \"what's left for a soul to do?\" (121).

Accepting the Reality of Biological Evolution by James Randi The well-established fact of biological [evolution](https://ncse.com/node/16774) is being increasingly and frantically denied in the USA by creationists, and as I write this, a public opinion poll has announced that some 46% of the U.S. public identify themselves as creationists. According to a recent study carried out at Michigan State University, acceptance of evolution by Americans declined from 45% in 1985\u2014already a shameful statistic\u2014 to 40% in 2005. It also found that only Turkey and the Vatican trail the U.S. in this denial of fact. Not accepting the reality of biological evolution is equivalent to not accepting the stark fact of gravity. You can deny gravity, or claim that Earth is flat, but such simple denials do not in any way prove a point. Evolution is the single, unifying scientific explanation for the diversity of life on Earth, and the foundation upon which the biological sciences are built. The scientific theory of evolution is accepted by an overwhelming majority of scientists around the world as the cornerstone of biology. To deny the reality of evolution is to deny the foundation upon which modern medicine and related biological sciences are built. Of course, creationists do not believe that they are denying the reality of anything. Their reality is that evolution is false and that creationism is true. They also do not claim that this is all based in faith; no, they think that they've got science behind them, and it is here where they are wrong, and where scientists can show why. I'll present here the example of cephalopods\u2014which include octopuses, squid, and cuttlefish\u2014which have one central systemic heart and two branchial hearts. The dominant central heart supplies blood to the body, to the ten tentacles of squid, and to the eight tentacles of the octopus. If such redundancy is okay for sea creatures, how come we humans can't get in on the plan? Not accepting the reality of biological evolution is equivalent to not accepting the stark fact of gravity. You can deny it, but such denial does not in any way prove a point. I've used such examples of poor design many times, along with two of my own favorites\u2014those delightful kidney stones, and cataracts\u2014but I also have some derived from my personal and professional point of view. I celebrate the fact that scallywags like me\u2014 magicians\u2014can produce some of our illusions because of the phenomenon known as persistence of vision, as well as the fact that the imaging part of the brain automatically switches off when the eye moves rapidly from one point to another, and that the mind\u2014to better bridge gaps of information\u2014can and does invent images that just aren't there. While such illusions can serve a survival function as satisfying substitutes for the facts, and can assuage certain fears, the awkward facts often insist on emerging, and the resulting induced alarms are often useful indicators of very real dangers and threats.

This excerpt also appeared in [Skeptic magazine 20.1](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/20.1/)\u2014a special issue on Terrorism\u2014in 2015. Myths of Terrorism by Michael Shermer In [The Moral Arc](https://www.skeptic.com/productlink/b162HB) I document a number of areas of moral progress, including the abolition of slavery and torture, the invention of rights, the expansion of civil liberties, the granting of the vote to blacks and women, gay rights and same-sex marriage, animal rights, the spread of liberal democracies and market economies, the decline of homicides, genocides, and even the percentage of populations who die in wars and revolutions. Whenever I recount this litany of good news for people, however, they inevitably ask \"what about terrorism?\" After all, a news cycle doesn't go by without a report of a suicide bombing or terrorist attack of some sort. Isn't terrorism an example of moral regress? Actually, the long-term trends even for terrorism are in the right direction. Compared to other forms of violence such as homicides and genocides, which themselves are on the decline, deaths and injuries from terrorism are statistical noise. More important, in terms of making political change, violent terrorism is a failed strategy that is on its way out. Why, then, do so many of us fear it? Terrorism is a form of asymmetrical warfare by non-state actors against innocent noncombatant civilians. As its name suggests, it attempts to gain power by evoking terror. This tactic raises our alarmist emotions, which in turn confounds our reasoning, making clear thinking about terrorism well nigh impossible. I suggest that there are at least seven myths that have arisen that need to be debunked to properly understand the causes of terrorism and to continue to reduce its frequency and effectiveness. Myth # 1: Terrorists are pure evil. This first myth took root in September, 2001 when President George W. Bush announced \"We will rid the world of the evildoers\" because they hate us for \"our freedom of religion, our freedom of speech, our freedom to vote and assemble and disagree with each other.\" [1](#note01) This sentiment embodies what the social psychologist Roy Baumeister calls \"the myth of pure evil,\" which holds that perpetrators of violence act only to commit senseless injury and pointless death for no rational reason. The \"terrorists-as-evil-doers\" myth is busted through the scientific study of violence, of which at least four types motivate terrorists: instrumental, dominance/honor, I document a number of areas of moral progress, including the abolition of slavery and torture, the invention of rights, the expansion of civil liberties, the granting of the vote to blacks and women, gay rights and same-sex marriage, animal rights, the spread of liberal democracies and market economies, the decline of homicides, genocides, and even the percentage of populations who die in wars and revolutions.

Aspartame: Safe Sweetener or Perilous Poison? by Harriet Hall, M.D. Aspartame is a low calorie sugar substitute marketed under brand names such as Equal and NutraSweet. It is a combination of two amino acids: L-aspartic acid and L-phenylalanine. It is available as individual packets for adding to foods and it is a component of many diet soft drinks and other reduced- calorie foods. Depending on who you listen to, it is either a safe aid to weight loss and diabetes control or it is evil incarnate, a deadly poison that is devastating the health of consumers. A reader sent me an ad from his local newspaper that recommended using Stevia instead of aspartame, and made these startling claims about aspartame: - It is derived from the excrement of genetically modified E. coli bacteria. - Upon ingestion, it breaks down into aspartic acid, phenylalanine, methanol, formaldehyde, and formic acid. - It accounts for over 75% of the adverse reactions to food additives reported to the FDA each year including seizures, migraines, dizzinesss, nausea, muscle spasms, weight gain, depression, fatigue, irritability, heart palpitations, breathing difficulties, anxiety, tinnitus, schizophrenia and death. Let's look at those claims one Perilous Poison? [Harriet Hall, M.D.](https://www.skeptic.com/author/skeptic/)| [Comments (98)](https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/aspartame-safe-sweetener-or-perilous-poison/#comments) Aspartame is a low calorie sugar substitute marketed under brand names such as Equal and NutraSweet. It is a combination of two amino acids: L-aspartic acid and L-phenylalanine. It is available as individual packets for adding to foods and it is a component of many diet soft drinks and other reduced- calorie foods.

Let's look at those claims one by one. - In some markets, aspartame manufacture takes advantage of modern genetic laboratory processes. A plasmid introduces genes into E. coli bacteria; the genes are incorporated into the bacterial DnA and they increase production of enzymes that enhance the production of phenylalanine. The bacteria produce more phenylalanine, serving as little living factories. The phenylalanine these workhorses produce for us is exactly the same as phenylalanine from any other source. It is disingenuous and inflammatory to characterize it as \"derived from excrement.\" Genetic processes like this are widely used today. One stunning example is Humulin. Diabetics used to develop allergic reactions to the beef and pork antigens in insulin derived from cows and pigs because it was slightly different from human insulin and contained impurities. Scientists found a way to put human insulin genes into E. coli bacteria and put them to work producing true, pure human insulin. This was such a great advantage to diabetics that animal insulins are no longer even available. - Some of the things we ingest are directly absorbed and utilized unchanged, like water. But most of what we ingest is metabolized. Aspartame is metabolized. It does indeed break down into aspartic acid, phenylalanine, and methanol. Aspartic acid and phenylalanine are amino acids that we need to survive. Methanol is produced in small amounts by the metabolism of many foods; it is harmless in small amounts. A cup of tomato juice produces six times as much methanol as a cup of diet soda. Methanol is completely metabolized by formaldehyde into formic acid; no formaldehyde remains. Lastly, the formic acid is broken down into water and carbon dioxide. Human studies show that formic acid is eliminated faster than it is formed after ingestion of aspartic acid. So yes, those compounds appear, but so READING THIS week's eSkeptic: SKEPTIC MAGAZINE Uploading Your Brain Is virtual immortality possible?

JUNIOR SKEPTIC Man-Eating Plants (issue 59) Physically bound inside each and every issue of Skeptic magazine is Junior Skeptic: an engagingly illustrated science and critical thinking publication for younger readers (and the young at heart). In this issue we journey into jungles, push past tangled vines, and search for something sinister: trees that are said to eat human beings! According to travellers' tales and newspaper stories, some mysterious plants capture and consume large animals. Growing in remote regions, these bloodthirsty vegetables wait for the unwary, surrounded by the bones of their victims. Their branches stir when there is no breeze. Inviting foliage conceals thorny vines ready to seize struggling prey. Is there any truth to these tales? Could such plants truly exist? Let's find out! SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN \"SKEPTIC\" COLUMN FOR JUNE 2016 Death Wish: What Would be Your Final Words? Between December 7, 1982, and February 16, 2016, the state of Texas executed 534 inmates, 417 of whom issued a last statement. This January in the journal Frontiers in Psychology, psychologists Sarah Hirschmuller and Boris Egloff, both at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz in Germany, published the results of their evaluation of most of the statements, which they put through a computerized text-analysis program called the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count. The biggest finding was a statistically significant difference between the average percentage of positive emotion words (9.64) and negative ones (2.65). Is that a lot? To find out, the psychologists compared this dataset with a broad spectrum of written sources, including scientific articles, novels, blogs and diaries, consisting of more than 168 million words composed by 23,173 people. The mean of 2.74 percent positive emotion words for each entry was statistically significantly lower than that of the prisoners. In fact, these death-row inmates were more positive than students asked to contemplate their own death and write down their thoughts and even more positive than people who attempted or completed suicides and left notes. What does this mean? Hirschmuller and Egloff contend that their data support terror management theory (TMT), which asserts that the realization of our mortality leads to unconscious terror, and \"an increased use of positive emotion words serves as a way to protect and defend against mortality salience of one's own contemplated death.\" But if that were so, then why the difference between the inmates' statements and those of suicide attempters and completers? Surely those about to kill themselves would be equally terrorized by the prospect of their imminent self-demise [...] FOLLOW MICHAEL SHERMER ON [Insight](https://www.skeptic.com/author/michael-shermer/) [The Moral Arc Blog](https://moralarc.org/blog/) There is no known biological mechanism for non-ionizing electromagnetic fields (EMF) to cause DNA damage, and thus cancer. Yet, the media continue to drop panic bombs, instilling fear where none is warranted. In this week's eSkeptic, Dr. Julie Frantsve-Hawley reminds us of the importance of sound science communication so that the general public can experience the same comfort in and reliance on science as scientists themselves. Dr. Hawley received her Ph.D. in Biomedical Sciences from Harvard University. [Read the author's bio](https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/electromagnetic-fields-and-parental-panics/#bio) at the end of the article. Electromagnetic Fields and Parental Panics: A case study in how science can bring comfort by Julie Frantsve-Hawley I am a scientist in the field of evidence-based medicine and public health. Basically, I am a science translator and communicator. I help healthcare workers use current science when treating patients, and developing policies and programs. Much of what I do involves working with world experts on a wide variety of topics to determine answers to health-related science issues. We ask questions about effectiveness of medical treatments. Which treatment is better? What treatments might cause harms? What are the risk factors for disease? We analyze results of clinical studies to figure out exactly what the results mean, and what we should do with this information. In addition to my career, I live the typical life of a working mother. I have two kids (a girl and a boy), a three-bedroom house in the suburbs, a two-car garage, a cat, a dog, two fish, and an amazing husband. Rarely does my profession and personal life interact, but a few years ago on my daughter's first day of school in first grade my worlds collided. One day while the children were having fun on the playground after school, one of the other mothers threw me what I call a panic science bomb. It seems that her daughter has eye twitches, and she has concluded that they are caused by electromagnetic fields (EMF) emanating from a transformer outside of her daughter's classroom. The transformer also happens to be in front of my daughter's new classroom, so that got my attention. Oh, and EMF causes cancer in children, she continued, suggesting that our daughters' lives are at stake! I call this a panic bomb because, although I am a scientist, I knew little about the health effects of EMFs, so for a moment I began to panic! What exactly are EMFs? And what might they be doing to my daughter and the other children at the school? My heart started racing. This is, of course, a natural reaction, for as Dr. Daniel Kahneman describes in his book [Thinking Fast and Slow](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0374533555/?tag=skepticcom20-20), [1](https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/electromagnetic-fields-and-parental-panics/#note01) people tend to react first with rapid intuition and emotion. But after a few moments my more thoughtful and critical thinking kicked in. I asked the mother what her daughter's pediatrician or eye doctor had said about the eye twitches. Her response was completely unexpected. She had not taken her daughter to either a pediatrician or eye doctor. Presumably her medical information came from the Interweb. She said she has a very high standard of health for her family and was demanding that the school move the transformer.

We analyze results of clinical studies to figure out exactly what the results mean, and what we should do with this information. In addition to my career, I live the typical life of a working mother. I have two kids (a girl and a boy), a three-bedroom house in the suburbs, a two-car garage, a cat, a dog, two fish, and an amazing husband. Rarely does my profession and personal life interact, but a few years ago on my daughter's first day of school in first grade my worlds collided. One day while the children were having fun on the playground after school, one of the other mothers threw me what I call a panic science bomb. It seems that her daughter has eye twitches, and she has concluded that they are caused by electromagnetic fields (EMF) emanating from a transformer outside of her daughter's classroom. The transformer also happens to be in front of my daughter's new classroom, so that got my attention. Oh, and EMF causes cancer in children, she continued, suggesting that our daughters' lives are at stake! I call this a panic bomb because, although I am a scientist, I knew little about the health effects of EMFs, so for a moment I began to panic! What exactly are EMFs? And what might they be doing to my daughter and the other children at the school? My heart started racing. This is, of course, a natural reaction, for as Dr. Daniel Kahneman describes in his book [Thinking Fast and Slow](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0374533555/?tag=skepticcom20-20), [1](#note01) people tend to react first with rapid intuition and emotion. But after a few moments my more thoughtful and critical thinking kicked in. I asked the mother what her daughter's pediatrician or eye doctor had said about the eye twitches. Her response was completely unexpected. She had not taken her daughter to either a pediatrician or eye doctor. Presumably her medical information came from the Interweb. She said she has a very high standard of health for her family and was demanding that the school move the transformer. That night, after my kids went to sleep, I spent hours online: of these organizations unequivocally stated that EMF is not associated with any health issue in adults, and there was certainly no evidence that it is associated with eye twitches. A 2002 report from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, a branch of the National Institutes of Health, titled [\"EMF: Electric and Magnetic Fields Associated with the Use of Electric Power\"](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/materials/electric_and_magnetic_fields_associated_with_the_use_of_electric_power_questions_and_answers_english_508.pdf), suggests that there may be a weak association between READING THIS POST...](https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/electromagnetic-fields-and-parental-panics/#more-32884) this week's eSkeptic: Why are so bad at spotting deception? In this week's eSkeptic, we present an excerpt from [The Confidence Game: Why We Fall For It...Every Time](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0525427414/?tag=skepticcom20-20) by Maria Konnikova, published by Viking, an imprint of Penguin Publishing Group, a division of Penguin Random House LLC.

Cons by Maria Konnikova Whenever people ask me if I've ever been conned, I tell them the truth: I have no idea. I've never given money to a Ponzi scheme or gotten tripped up on an unwinnable game of three-card monte\u2014that much I know. And there have been some smaller deceptions I've certainly fallen for\u2014though whether they qualify as full-fledged cons is a matter of dispute. But here's the thing about cons: the best of them are never discovered. We don't ever realize we've fallen; we simply write our loss off as a matter of bad luck. Magicians often resist showing the same trick twice. Once the element of surprise is gone, the audience becomes free to pay attention to everything else\u2014and is thus much more likely to spot the ruse. But the best tricks can be repeated ad infinitum. They are so well-honed that there is practically no deception to spot. Harry Houdini, the magician and famed exposer of frauds, boasted that he could figure out any trick once he'd thrice seen it. One evening at Chicago's Great Northern Hotel, the story goes, a fellow conjurer, Dai Vernon, approached him with a card trick. Vernon removed a card from the top of the deck and asked Houdini to initial it\u2014an \"H.H.\" in the corner. The card was then placed in the middle of the deck. Vernon snapped his fingers. It was a miracle. The top card in the deck was now Houdini's. It was, as the name of the routine suggests, an \"ambitious card.\" No matter where you put it, it rose to the top. Seven times Vernon demonstrated, and seven times Houdini was stumped. The truly clever trick needs no hiding. (In this case, it was a sleight-of-hand effect that is often performed by skilled magicians today but was, back then, a novelty.) When it comes to cons, the exact same principle holds. The best confidence games remain below the radar. They are never prosecuted because they are never detected. It's not uncommon, in fact, for the same person to fall for the exact same con multiple times. James Franklin Norfleet, a Texas rancher, lost first $20,000, and then, in short order, $25,000, to the exact same racket and the exact same gang. He'd never realized the first go-around was a scam. David Maurer describes one victim who, several years after falling for a well-known wire con\u2014the grifter pretends to have a way of getting race results seconds before they are announced, allowing the mark to place a sure-win bet\u2014spotted his deceivers on the street. He ran toward them. Their hearts sank. Surely, he was going to turn them in. Not at all. He was wondering if he could once more play that game he'd lost at way back when. He was certain that, this time, his luck had turned. The men were only too happy to comply. Even someone like [Bernie Madoff](https://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/08-12-23/#feature) went undetected for at least twenty years. He was seventy when his scheme crumbled. What if he'd died before it blew up? One can imagine a future where his victims would be none the wiser\u2014as long as new investments kept coming in. In June 2007, Slate writer Justin Peters decided to be creative about his airfare to Italy. Short on money, he was nevertheless eager to spend a few months out of the country. And he had what he considered a pretty damn brilliant plan for solving the dilemma. He'd buy airline miles from someone willing to part with them, and then use them to purchase a reduced fare. He promptly started scouring the Internet for anyone with a mile surplus. He was lucky. Soon after he began his search, he found Captain Chris Hansen, a pilot with countless unused miles he'd put up for purchase on Craigslist. Peters quickly replied to his posting\u2014god forbid the miles went to someone else. They talked on the phone. Captain Chris seemed knowledgeable and friendly. \"Our conversation convinced me that he was on the level,\" Peters writes. A deal was promptly arranged: $650. A hundred thousand miles. PayPal. Simple. Except PayPal rejected the transaction. How odd, Peters thought. He followed up with the captain about the error. The pilot was strangely silent.

WATCH THE DEBATE RECORDING The God vs. Science Smackdown: Keith Ward vs. Michael Shermer On March 7, 2016, noted British author, theologian and philosopher Keith Ward of Oxford University and scientist and skeptic Michael Shermer debated on the nature of reality, science and religion, and God's existence. The debate addressed questions such as: Can science really explain the origin of the universe, life, consciousness and morality without recourse to God? Or does science in fact provide enough evidence to make belief in God rational? If you missed this live debate, you can watch it here now for "}
