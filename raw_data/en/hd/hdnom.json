Though a single intramuscular (IM) megadose of vitamin D is economical, and ensures good compliance, it poses the risk of hypervitaminosis D. This observational study was conducted to assess the duration of effect and safety of single IM megadose of cholecalciferol in the treatment of vitamin D deficiency rickets. Children younger than 14 years with rickets were enrolled. Baseline investigations included radiograph of wrists and estimation of serum calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 25(OH) vitamin D and parathormone (PTH) levels. All children received a single IM megadose of vitamin D3. Biochemical parameters were re-evaluated at 1.5, 3 and 6 months after the megadose and the values were compared to the baseline. We enrolled 21 children, out of which nine remained under active follow-up till 6 months. Radiological evidence of rickets was present in all 21 children, 14 had hypocalcemia at the time of presentation. After IM cholecalciferol megadose, median 25 hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D] level remained significantly more than the baseline till 6 months after the megadose. At 1.5 months after the vitamin D megadose, three (30%) of the children were found to develop toxic levels of vitamin D (>150 ng/mL), although none had hypercalcemia or any clinical manifestation of vitamin D toxicity. At 3 months and 6 months after the megadose, 25(OH)D levels remained in the sufficient range (20-100 ng/mL) in seven out of the eight children who came for follow-up. A single IM megadose of vitamin D may be effective in significantly increasing the 25(OH)D levels for at least 6 months in children with rickets, but elevation of 25(OH)D to toxic range raises concern regarding its safety. [Relationship between megadose vitamin supplementation and immunological function in a healthy elderly population.](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=1536802) Goodwin, J S; Garry, P J 1983-01-01 We studied the immunological effects of 'megadose' vitamin or mineral supplementation by comparing the immunological functions of healthy elderly subjects taking large amounts of specific nutrients to similar subjects not on supplements. There was a non-significant trend for those subjects taking megadoses of vitamin C to have increased cell-mediated immune responses as measured in vivo by skin test reactivity but not by in vitro mitogen responses. In addition, subjects taking megadoses of vitamin E or any of several B vitamins (B1, B2, B6, folate and niacin) had lower absolute circulating lymphocyte counts than did the rest of the population. The relative lack of effect of megadose vitamins on immunological function in this population compared to reports of short term trials of mega nutrients raises the possibility that some of the previously reported immuno-enhancing properties of megadose vitamins may be due to a non-specific adjuvant effect that disappears with time. PMID:6851251 [Mega-dose vitamin C attenuated lung inflammation in mouse asthma model.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21267403) Jeong, Young-Joo; Kim, Kang, Jae Seung; Hwang, Young-Il 2010-12-01 Asthma is a Th2-dependent disease mediated by IgE and Th2 cytokines, and asthmatic patients suffer from oxidative stresses from abnormal airway inflammation. Vitamin C is a micro-nutrient functioning as an antioxidant. When administered at a mega-dose, vitamin C has been reported to shift immune responses toward Th1. Thus, we tried to determine whether vitamin C exerted beneficial effects in asthma animal model. Asthma was induced in mice by sensitizing and challenging with ovalbumin. At the time of challenge, 3~5 mg of vitamin C was administered and the effects were evaluated. Vitamin C did not modulate Th1/Th2 balance in asthma model. However, it decreased airway hyperreactivity to methacholine, decreased inflammatory cell numbers in brochoalveolar lavage fluid, and moderate reduction of perivascular and peribronchiolar inflammatory cell infiltration. These results suggest that vitamin C administered at the time of antigen challenge exerted anti-inflammatory effects. Further studies based on chronic asthma model are needed to evaluate a long-term effect of vitamin C in asthma. In conclusion, even though vitamin C did not show any Th1/Th2 shifting effects in this experiment, it still exerted moderate anti-inflammatory effects. Considering other beneficial effects and inexpensiveness of vitamin C, mega-dose usage of vitamin C could be a potential supplementary modality for the management of asthma. [Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin with or without interferon -2b and megadose versus recommended daily allowance vitamins during induction and maintenance intravesical treatment of nonmuscle L 2010-11-01 In a multicenter, prospectively randomized study we evaluated bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin alone vs bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin plus interferon -2b and megadose vitamins vs recommended daily allowance vitamins during induction and maintenance intravesical therapy in the treatment of nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer. Patients who were bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin na\u00efve with carcinoma in situ, Ta or T1 urothelial cancer were randomized to receive intravesical bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin or bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin plus interferon -2b. Patients were further randomized to receive a recommended daily allowance or megadose vitamin preparation. Induction bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin treatment was given weekly for 6 weeks, and patients who were recurrence-free received maintenance treatment at 4, 7, 13, 19, 25 and 37 months. Patients were followed with quarterly cystoscopy for 2 years, then semiannually through year 4 and then annually. The primary end point was biopsy confirmed tumor recurrence or positive cytology. A total of 670 patients were accrued and randomized. At 24-month median followup recurrence-free survival was similar in all groups with 63% in the bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin with recommended daily allowance vitamins group, 59% in bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin with megadose vitamins, 55% in bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin/interferon -2b with recommended daily allowance vitamins and 61% in bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin/interferon -2b with megadose vitamins (p >0.05). The addition of interferon -2b was associated with a more frequent incidence of fever (11% vs 5%) and constitutional symptoms (18% vs 11%) vs bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin alone (p <0.05). Interferon -2b added to bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin induction and maintenance intravesical therapy did not decrease tumor recurrence in bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin na\u00efve cases, but was associated with increased fever and constitutional symptoms. No difference in time to recurrence was present in patients receiving recommended daily [Impact of nutrition education and mega-dose vitamin A supplementation on the health of children in Pant, impact on vitamin A deficiency (VAD), wasting malnutrition, and excessive childhood mortality of two alternative approaches-nutrition education and mega-dose capsule distribution (6-12-month-olds: 100,000 IU; 1-5-year-olds: 200,000 IU)-in communities in Nepal are compared. Approximately 40,000 children from 75 locations in seven districts in two ecological settings (lowland and hills) took part in the study and were randomly allocated to intervention cohorts or a control group. At 24 months after the implementation of the project the reduction of risk for xerophthalmia was greater among children whose mothers were able to identify vitamin-A-rich foods (relative risk (RR) = 0.25; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.10-0.62) than among the children who received mega-dose capsules (RR = 0.59; 95% CI = 0.41-0.84). The risk of mortality at 2 years was reduced for both the nutrition education (RR = 0.64; 95% Cl = 0.48-0.86) and capsule distribution (RR = 0.57; 95% CI = 0.42-0.77) cohorts. The nutrition education programme was, however, more expensive to deliver than the capsule distribution programme. High rates of participation for children in the supplementation programme were achieved quickly. The nutrition education messages also spread rapidly throughout the study population (regardless of intervention cohort assignment). Practices, however, were slower to change. In communities where maternal literacy was low and channels of communication were limited the capsule distribution programme appeared to be more economical. However, there are economies of scale for nationwide education programmes that do not exist for capsule distribution programmes. Although nutrition education provides economies of scale and the promise of long-term sustainability, a comprehensive national programme requires both dietary supplementation and nutrition education components.

Adult patients with SRSE who were treated with MDPB in our institution from March 2005 to September 2014 were reviewed. We collected data on basic demographics, clinical features, functional status, anticonvulsant treatment, and possible adverse events. SRSE outcome was divided into six categories: successful therapy, initial failure, breakthrough seizures, withdrawal seizures, intolerable side effects, and death during treatment. Ten adult patients with SRSE received MDPB. Median age at seizure onset was 38 years (range: 18-59), and half were male. All patients had no history of seizures and had symptoms suggestive of viral encephalitis. Median duration of status epilepticus was 17.5 days (range: 6-60) and anaesthetics were used for a median of 14.0 days (range: 2-54) before MDPB. Successful control of SRSE was achieved in half of the patients, however, only one of ten patients was able to fully recover at discharge. Median duration of the MDPB was 45.5 days and the maximum serum phenobarbital level reached a median of 151.5 g/ml. Patients with successful MDPB therapy had normal brain imaging (80% vs. 0%; p=0.048) and better functional outcome at discharge and after three months of follow-up. Infection was the most critical complication, along with cardiorespiratory depression. MDPB is a therapeutic option for control of SRSE when other choices are exhausted. [A case of aminoglycosides induced retinal toxicity treated with megadoses of steroids 2016-06-01 The case is described of a patient who had a sudden loss of vision in her right eye after glaucoma surgery. A diagnosis of retinal toxicity due to tobramycin (an aminoglycoside) was reached, which was characterised by retinal whitening with a red cherry stain, macular oedema, and vasculitis that progressed to papillary and macular atrophy with arteriolar sclerosis. Given the severity of symptoms an early attempt was made with megadoses of steroids and an intravitreal dexamethasone implant (Ozurdex\u00ae, Allergan S.A.), without response. Aminoglycoside toxicity is a rare, idiosyncratic, very serious complication for which there is no effective treatment. Copyright \u00a9 2016 Sociedad Espa\u00f1ola de Oftalmolog\u00eda. Published by Kirkland, J B 1995-07-01 Previous work in our laboratory has shown that dietary megadoses of nicotinamide, used in the prevention of diabetes, cause increases in hepatic poly(ADP-ribose). Poly(ADP-ribose) is synthesized from NAD+ by a nuclear enzyme, poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase, which is activated by DNA strand breaks. The nicotinamide-induced increase in poly(ADP-ribose) could result from an increase in substrate, NAD+, or the induction of strand breaks in DNA. Strand breaks may result from the depletion of single carbon groups, through the excretion of methylated derivatives of nicotinamide. To differentiate between these mechanisms, a 3 x 3 factorial experiment was conducted in which rats were fed diets containing various supplements of choline bitartrate (0, 2, 20 g/kg diet) and nicotinamide (0, 1, 2 g/kg diet). At the conclusion of treatments, blood NAD+ and liver lipid, NAD+ and poly(ADP-ribose) levels were determined. Choline deficiency caused the characteristic accumulation of fat in the liver at all levels of nicotinamide. In choline deficient rats, nicotinamide supplements further increased liver lipid concentration. Blood and liver NAD+ concentrations were increased by nicotinamide supplementation, irrespective of choline status. In contrast, liver poly(ADP-ribose) levels were increased by nicotinamide supplementation only in choline deficient rats. These results show that nicotinamide-induced increases in poly(ADP-ribose) levels appear to be dependent on decreased methyl donor status and suggest that adequate choline status is important for preventing some deleterious effects of nicotinamide treatment. [Misdiagnosis of Graves' Disease with Apparent Severe Hyperthyroidism in a Patient Taking Biotin Megadoses.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27043844) Barbesino, Giuseppe 2016-06-01 Accurate immunoassays measuring minute quantities of hormones are the cornerstone of the practice of endocrinology. Despite tremendous advances in this field, novel pitfalls in these tests emerge from time to time. Oral biotin can interfere with immunoassays of several hormones. The purpose of this report is to relate an extreme case of such interference. A patient with progressive multiple sclerosis was found to have extremely elevated free thyroxine, triiodothyronine, and suppressed thyrotropin (TSH) levels. His TSH receptor binding inhibiting antibody level was also elevated. This constellation of laboratory findings suggested a diagnosis of severe Graves' disease. All of the assays yielding abnormal results employed the biotin-streptavidin affinity in their design. The patient had no symptoms of hyperthyroidism, and detailed review of his medications revealed intake of megadoses of biotin. Temporary discontinuation of biotin treatment resulted in complete resolution of the biochemical abnormalities. Non-physiologic biotin supplementation may interfere with several immunoassays, including thyroid hormones, TSH, thyroglobulin, and TSH receptor binding inhibiting antibody, leading to erroneous diagnoses. Questioning for biotin intake should be part of the evaluation for patients undergoing endocrine tests. Interruption of biotin supplementation for at least two days prior to biotin-sensitive tests should be sufficient to avoid major misdiagnoses. [Effect of vitamin D3 supplementation and influence of BsmI polymorphism of the VDR gene of the inflammatory profile and oxidative stress in elderly women with vitamin D insufficiency: Vitamin D3 megadose reduces Maria 2015-06-01 This to evaluate the effect of vitamin D3 megadose supplementation and influence of BsmI polymorphism in the VDR gene on the inflammatory profile and oxidative stress in elderly women with vitamin D deficiency. A double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted with 40 elderly women (aged 68\u00b16 years) diagnosed with vitamin D insufficiency (24.7\u00b13.1 ng/mL). Participants were distributed into a supplementation group that received 200,000 IU of vitamin D3 (SG; n=20) and a placebo group (PG; n=20). Blood samples were collected at baseline and after intervention to analyse the 25(OH)D, parathyroid hormone, antioxidant capacity (TAC), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, as well as the renal and hepatic function, and genotyping was performed for BsmI polymorphism. Four weeks after supplementation, elderly women in the SG group showed a significant increase in the serum concentration of 25(OH)D (25.29\u00b12.8 to 31.48\u00b16.0; p=0.0001), which was followed by increased (65.25\u00b115.66 to p=0.005). Changes in BP, ANAC and MDA were not observed. The 25(OH)D and PTH, us-CRP and AGP-A levels of participants with the BB/Bb genotype were more responsive to supplementation, but their other markers did not change. Supplementation with a vitamin D3 megadose reduced inflammatory markers and increased the total antioxidant capacity in elderly women with vitamin D insufficiency. The 25(OH)D, PTH, us-CRP and AGP-A levels of elderly patients with the BB/Bb genotype were more responsive to supplementation compared with those with the bb genotype.

[The effects of prednisolone and serum malondialdehyde levels in The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of different doses of prednisolone in puppies experimentally induced with meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). Meconium was collected from human babies in the first day of life and was released into the trachea of 11 newborn puppies to induce MAS. Puppies were treated with 2 mg/kg prednisolone (standard dose), 30 mg/kg prednisolone (megadose) or 0.9% saline, all administered intravenously. The study ended 20 h after meconium aspiration and the lungs were then scored for histopathology. Animals not treated with prednisolone deteriorated after 8 h while respiration rate, oxygenation, pH and partial pressure of carbon dioxide values were better in the prednisolone-treated groups. Histopathology scores were better in the treatment groups compared with the control group, with megadose giving the best result. At the end of the study, serum malondialdehyde levels were significantly higher in the megadose prednisolone group compared with the other two groups. In conclusion, we determined that prednisolone reduced physiological and histological changes in puppies with MAS and that a 30 mg/kg dose was more effective than 2 mg/kg. [Fatal pulmonary co-infection with pneumocystis and 33-year-old homosexual Japanese man who admitted to having sex with men presented with a two-week history of dyspnea and fever. Chest imaging showed diffuse pulmonary frosted-glass-like shadows. A blood test revealed positive HIV antibodies with a CD4 cell count of 66/L. Bronchoalveolar lavage identified pneumocystis. Although the patient exhibited a transient response to anti-pneumocystis treatment and mega-dose steroid pulse therapy, he eventually died from respiratory failure. An autopsy suggested massive cytomegalovirus and pneumocystis pneumonitis. The pulmonary co-infection with cytomegalovirus may have been worsened by the use of mega-dose steroids, and such therapy should be avoided in patients with a high HIV viral load and low CD4 count.

[Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti) Provides Residual Control of Aedes in Small Ritchie, Scott A.; Rapley, Luke Benjamin, Seleena examined the use of megadoses of VectoBac WG for residual control of Aedes aegypti 2-L plastic buckets. Doses of 10\u00d7, 20\u00d7, and 50\u00d7 the recommended rate of 8 mg/L provided 90% control for 8, 8, and 23 weeks, respectively. There was no significant difference in mortality between dry (neat) or aqueous mixture of VectoBac WG. Pretreatment of dry containers up to 8 weeks before flooding did not significantly decrease efficacy through 11 success weeks. Thus, megadoses of dry formulations of Bti can be used for residual control of Ae. aegypti in small containers. Furthermore, these doses use small amounts of product (0.08-0.4 g/L) that is more practical to measure than the minute amounts (0.008 g/L) required by the recommended rate, and cost US$2.18 to treat 50 Cairns yards containing an average total of 80 containers. This method could also be used to control Aedes albopictus.

[[Mega-dosages vitamin D: progressive medicine?].](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2234152) Kerstens, P J; van Ditzhuijsen, T J; van Tongeren, J H 1990-10-06 Although the risk of vitamin intoxication is well recognised, massive doses of these preparations continue to be prescribed, especially in the so-called 'alternative' medical sector. We describe a patient with hypervitaminosis D due to administration of megadoses of vitamin D in the absence of an obvious indication. Mode of action and symptoms of vitamin D intoxication are discussed. It is emphasized that vitamin preparations should only be used when strictly indicated and that close clinical and biochemical supervision is necessary. [Nutritional aspects of ascorbic acid: uses and abuses.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7008359) Vilter, R W 1980-12-01 Ascorbic acid in physiological doses is essential for the normal functioning of the human body. Larger doses are required to treat a severe deficiency of vitamin C intake, as in the case of scurvy. Occasionally, massive doses may be required to treat a metabolic defect involving ascorbic acid. There has been some mention of megadose therapy with ascorbic acid for the prevention of colds, the improved healing of wounds and even the treatment of cancer, but no acceptable scientific data have been presented. In fact, in a few instances, such therapy has proved injurious. [Megavitamin treatment of mental retardation in children: a review of effects on behavior and cognition.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19630613) Kozlowski, B W 1992-01-01 ABSTRACT Many forms of vitamin supplementation have been proposed for the treatment of behavioral and cognitive disorders in children with mental retardation. Except for nutrient deficiencies and selected inborn errors of metabolism, the efficacy of these treatments has not been established. Therapeutic supplementation with vitamin B(6) in Down syndrome and folie acid in fragile X syndrome was attempted following the identification of apparent biochemical aberrations involving the nutrients. Double-blind controlled trials have revealed no evidence that B(6) treatment was effective in Down syndrome. Very limited evidence, only among prepubertal subjects, suggested that behaviors improved with folie acid treatment in fragile X syndrome. There is less clarity of the scientific rationales for various combinations of vitamins (or vitamins and minerals) that have been promoted according to the concept of orthomolecular medicine. Well-designed controlled studies, with data presented in conformity with generally accepted scientific standards, have not supported the efficacy of megadose supplementation with 1) multivitamins in cognitive disabilities or attention deficit disorders, or 2) multivitamins and minerals in Down syndrome or other forms of mental retardation. Insufficient data are available to support claims made for vitamin B(6) and magnesium supplementation in autism. Research in the larger field of nutrient-behavior research has reinforced the need for studies to be more rigorously designed and to draw on the expertise of multiple disciplines. Evidence of toxic effects of nutrients continues to accrue, reinforcing the fact that megadoses should not be used indiscriminately or without physician monitoring. For children with mental retardation generally, assuring that established nutritional needs are met warrants primary consideration. [Relative hyperoxaluria, crystalluria and haematuria D; Rodgers, A L 1998-09-01 Long-term or high-dosage consumption of vitamin C may play a role in calcium oxalate kidney stone formation. The present study was undertaken to determine the biochemical and physicochemical risk factors in a male subject who developed haematuria and calcium oxalate crystalluria after ingestion of large doses of ascorbic acid for 8 consecutive days. Twenty-four-hour urine samples were collected before and during the ascorbic acid ingestion period as well as after the detection of haematuria. A special procedure was implemented for urine collections to allow for oxalate, ascorbate and other urinalysis. Oxalate was determined in the presence of EDTA to prevent in vitro conversion to ascorbic acid, whereas ascorbate itself was determined by manual titration in a redox method using the dye dichlorophenolindophenol. Urinalysis data were used to compute calcium oxalate relative supersaturations and Tiselius risk indices, whereas scanning electron microscopy was used to examine urinary deposits. Oxalate excretion increased by about 350% during ascorbate ingestion before haematuria. Ascorbate concentrations also increased dramatically but appeared to reach a plateau maximum. Increasing calcium excretion was accompanied by decreasing potassium and phosphate values. The calcium oxalate relative supersaturation and Tiselius risk index increased during vitamin C ingestion and large aggregates of calcium oxalate dihydrate crystals were observed by scanning electron microscopy immediately after the detection of haematuria. High percentage metabolic conversion of ascorbate to oxalate in this subject caused relative hyperoxaluria and crystalluria, the latter manifesting itself as haematuria. Clinicians need to be alerted to the potential dangers of large dose ingestion of vitamin C in some individuals. Hoffer, Abram 1975-01-01 Nutrition as a treatment component for schizophrenia is a novel concept. A brief introduction outlines the need for physicians to become nutritionally minded, since the processing of food has deteriorated its quality. The elements of good nutrition are described. There are several etiologies for the schizophrenia syndrome. It is suggested that these include Vitamin B-3 and B-6 dependency, mineral deficiency, particularly zinc, and cerebral reactions (termed allergy). The treatment based upon these ideas includes good nutrition (junk-free diet), megadoses of some vitamins, minerals, attention to certain foods which produce psychosis in a few; all in a judicious combination with standard psychiatric therapy. Such a program will improve the recovery rate over standard therapy alone. PMID:20469184 [Dietary 2006-06-01 Physical induces oxidative stress and tissue damage. Although a basal level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is required to drive redox signaling and numerous physiologic processes, excess ROS during exercise may have adverse implications on health and performance. Antioxidant nutrients may be helpful in that regard. Caution should be exercised against excess antioxidant supplements, however. This article presents a digest for sports practitioners. The following three recommendations are made: 1) it is important to determine the individual antioxidant need of each athlete performing a specific sport; 2) multinutrient preparations, as opposed to megadoses of any single form of nutrient, seem to be a more prudent path to choose; and 3) for outcomes of antioxidant supplementation, performance should not be the only criteria. Overall well being of the athlete, faster recovery, and minimization of injury time could all be affected by antioxidant therapy. [The effect of neonatal vitamin A supplementation on morbidity and mortality at 12 (NVAS) is an intervention hypothesized to reduce infant morbidity and mortality. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of neonatal vitamin A supplementation in reducing infant morbidity and mortality and assess potential sources of heterogeneity of the effect of NVAS. Methods: We completed an individually randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in Tanzania. Infants were randomized within 3 days of birth to a single dose of vitamin A (50 000 IU) or placebo. We assessed infants at 1 and 3 days after supplementation, as well as 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after supplementation. We included all live births in the analysis and used relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to assess the risks of mortality and hospitalization by 12 months. We used general estimating equations to assess the incidence of morbidities during infancy. Results: A total of 31 999 infants were enrolled in the study between August 2010 and March 2013. At 12 months, vitamin A did not reduce all-cause infant mortality (RR 1.04; 95% CI 0.92-1.16), nor affect hospitalization (RR morbidity 0.96-1.05). Postpartum maternal vitamin A supplementation modified the effect of neonatal vitamin A supplementation on mortality at 12 months (P-value, test for interaction = 0.04). Among infants born to women who received a mega-dose of vitamin A after delivery, NVAS appeared to increase the risk of death (RR 1.12; 95% CI 0.98-1.29), whereas the risk of death among infants born to women who did not receive a mega-dose was reduced (RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.70-1.06). We noted no modification of the effect of NVAS by infant gender, birthweight or maternal HIV status. Conclusion: NVAS did not affect the risk of death or incidence of common childhood morbidities. However, this study sheds light on potential sources of heterogeneity of the effect of neonatal vitamin A [Gym and tonic: a profile of 100 male steroid users.](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=1332477) Evans, N A 1997-01-01 OBJECTIVE: To identify unsupervised anabolic steroid regimens used by athletes. METHODS: 100 athletes attending four gymnasia were surveyed using an anonymous self administered questionnaire. RESULTS: Anabolic steroid doses ranged from 250 to 3200 mg per week and users combined different drugs to achieve these doses. Injectable and oral preparations were used in cycles lasting four to 12 weeks. Eighty six per cent of users admitted to the regular use of drugs other than steroids for various reasons, including additional anabolic effects, the minimisation of steroid related side effects, and withdrawal symptoms. Acne, striae, and gynaecomastia were the most commonly reported subjective side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple steroids are combined in megadoses and self administered in a cyclical fashion. Polypharmacy is practised by over 80% of steroid users. Skeletal muscle hypertrophy along with acne, striae, and gynaecomastia are frequent physical signs associated with steroid use. Images Figure 2 PMID:9132214 [Optimizing autologous cell grafts Yannaki, Evangelia 2016-07-01 Over the past decade, stem cell gene therapy has achieved unprecedented curative outcomes for several genetic disorders. Despite the unequivocal success, clinical gene therapy still faces challenges. Genetically engineered hematopoietic stem cells are particularly vulnerable to attenuation of their repopulating capacity once exposed to culture conditions, ultimately leading to low engraftment levels posttransplant. This becomes of particular importance when transduction rates are low or/and competitive transplant conditions are generated by reduced-intensity conditioning in the absence of a selective advantage of the transduced over the unmodified cells. These limitations could partially be overcome by introducing megadoses of genetically modified CD34(+) cells into conditioned patients or by transplanting hematopoietic stem cells hematopoietic stem cells with high engrafting and repopulating potential. On the basis of the lessons gained from cord blood transplantation, we summarize the most promising approaches to date of increasing either the numbers of hematopoietic stem cells for transplantation or/and their engraftability, as a platform toward the optimization of engineered stem cell grafts.

[Vitamins for Cardiovascular Diseases: Is the knowledge that a well-balanced diet provides most of the nutritional requirements, the use of supplemental vitamins is widespread among adults in the United States. Evidence from large randomized controlled trials over the last 2 decades does not support vitamin supplementation for the reduction of cardiovascular risk factors or clinical outcomes. Many of the vitamins used in common practice likely are safe when consumed in small doses, but long-term consumption of megadoses is not only expensive but has the potential to cause adverse effects. Therefore, a need exists to revisit this issue, reminding the public and healthcare providers about the data supporting the use of vitamins for cardiovascular disease, and the potential for harm and the expense associated with their unnecessary use. In this review, we highlight the scientific evidence from randomized controlled studies regarding the efficacy and safety of vitamin supplementation for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases and outcomes. We also draw attention to issues related to widespread and indiscriminate use of vitamin supplements and the need to educate the public to curtail unnecessary consumption and expense by limiting their use based on strong scientific evidence. [Vitamin D: link between osteoporosis, obesity, and Bressan, Josefina 2014-04-17 Vitamin D (1,25(OH)2D3) a steroid hormone that has a range of physiological functions in skeletal and nonskeletal tissues, and can contribute to prevent and/or treat osteoporosis, obesity, and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In bone metabolism, vitamin D increases the plasma levels of calcium and phosphorus, regulates osteoblast and osteoclast the activity, and combats PTH hypersecretion, promoting bone formation and preventing/treating osteoporosis. This evidence is supported by most clinical studies, especially those that have included calcium and assessed the effects of vitamin D doses (800 IU/day) on bone mineral density. However, annual megadoses should be avoided as they impair bone health. Recent findings suggest that low serum vitamin D is the consequence (not the cause) of obesity and the results from randomized double-blind clinical trials are still scarce and inconclusive to establish the relationship between vitamin D, obesity, and T2DM. Nevertheless, there is evidence that vitamin D inhibits fat accumulation, increases insulin synthesis and preserves pancreatic islet cells, decreases insulin resistance and reduces hunger, favoring obesity and T2DM control. To date, there is not enough scientific evidence to support the use of vitamin D as a pathway to prevent and/or treat obesity and T2DM. [Key issues in nutrition. Disease prevention through adulthood and old age.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3037508) Fahey, P J; Boltri, J M; Monk, J S 1987-07-01 Certain dietary practices are valid methods of lowering the risk of disease. Others, while popular, have unproven benefits or may even be associated with risks of their own. Careful evaluation of hypercholesterolemia is necessary. Persons with a high level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and a low level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol need diet therapy, because they are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Weight reduction and fat restriction can lower blood pressure, help control hyperglycemia, and improve the LDL cholesterol-HDL cholesterol ratio. Some evidence indicates a protective role of beta carotene against cancer in animals. However, hypervitaminosis A is dangerous and relatively easy to accomplish, so supplementation beyond a multivitamin tablet is discouraged. Data about inhibition of cancer in humans through use of high doses of vitamin E or C or selenium are inconclusive, and studies of effects of long-term ingestion are not available. In general, megadoses of even healthy substances are thought to be dangerous. Decreased consumption of fat, increased consumption of foods high in fiber, and elimination of alcohol and tobacco are sensible recommendations. Consumption of cruciferous vegetables has not been proven to reduce the incidence of cancer, but a moderate amount of them in the diet would seem reasonable. [Alert to users of calcium supplements as antihypertensive agents due to trace metal contaminants.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3415787) Boulos, F M; von Smolinski, A 1988-07-01 Although there are controversies in the role of calcium as an antihypertensive agent, the use of \"health food\" supplements, such as dolomite and bone meal, is on the rise especially among the older population. One brand of commercial dolomite tablets were investigated for metallic contents such as aluminum (Al), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), manganese (Mn), sclemium (Se), and zinc (Zn). Ten randomly selected tablets were weighted, dried, pulverized and low-temperature plasma ashed. An ash aliquot of each tablet was dissolved in 35% Ultrex nitric acid, and after dilution analyzed using a Perkin-Elmer Model 5000 atomic absorption spectrophotometer equipped with an HGA-500 graphite furnace, As-1 autosampler, and PRS-10 printer sequencer. The results (presented as mean wt/g of powder +/- 95% confidence limits) are: Al 900 +/- 300 micrograms/g; 1.3 +/- 0.3 micrograms/g; Cd and Zn 147 +/- 88 micrograms/g. These trace metals could pose health hazards to the public such as lead poisoning, dementia, and hypertension due to cadmium. Also, zinc can potentiate cadmium-hypertensive effects. The need exists to initiate some regulations to limit maximal content of trace metals in \"health food\" supplements to protect high-risk groups and that sector of the population who use megadoses of such products. [Provider and patient expectations for dietary supplement discussions.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24875792) D; Paterniti, Debora A 2014-09-01 Dietary supplement use in the United States is common. Patients can procure supplements without a prescription, and often do not disclose supplement use to their healthcare providers. Providers and patients may be uncertain about what would be appropriate or helpful in discussions of supplements during routine office visits. To explore provider and patient expectations for discussions of dietary supplements. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposeful sample of healthcare providers from three specialties and their patients who reported taking supplements. Thirty-five outpatient providers (14 primary care, six integrative medicine, and 15 complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) providers) and 107 of their patients. Qualitative analysis of transcripts using grounded theory and iterative review. Both providers and patients raised twelve common topics about dietary supplements that they felt were important to discuss during office visits, such as: supplements taken; supplement risks (interactions, safety/harm, side benefits; efficacy; alternative treatments; and patient expectations/preferences for treatment. Some topics were mentioned more frequently by providers than patients, such as how to take, reason for taking, and evidence for use. Providers raised several topics that were mentioned infrequently by patients. Supplement costs and regulations were not brought up by any patients, even though consideration of these topics could influence patient decisions to take supplements. Complementary healthcare providers brought up topics not mentioned by primary care providers, such as the importance of supplement brands and supplement mega-dosing. Patients and providers have concordant views about the need to discuss patient supplement use and ensure patient safety. Patients may undervalue, be unaware of, or discount information about cost or regulations that could affect their decision-making about supplement use [Alternative treatments for adults with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11462750) Arnold, L E 2001-06-01 A previous review of alternative treatments (Tx) of ADHD--those other than psychoactive medication and behavioral/psychosocial Tx--was supplemented with an additional literature search focused on adults with ADHD. Twenty-four alternative Tx were identified, ranging in scientific documentation from discrediting controlled studies through mere hypotheses to positive controlled double-blind clinical trials. Many of them are applicable only to a specific subgroup. Although oligoantigenic (few-foods) diets have convincing double-blind evidence of efficacy for a properly selected subgroup of children, they do not appear promising for adults. Enzyme-potentiated desensitization, relaxation/EMG biofeedback, and deleading also have supplementation, magnesium supplementation, Chinese herbals, EEG biofeedback, massage, meditation, mirror feedback, channel-specific perceptual training, and vestibular stimulation all have promising prospective pilot data, many of these tests reasonably controlled. Single-vitamin megadosage has some intriguing pilot trial data. Zinc supplementation is hypothetically supported by systematic case-control data, but no systematic clinical trial. Laser acupuncture has promising unpublished pilot data and may be more applicable to adults than children. Essential fatty acid supplementation has promising systematic case-control data, but clinical trials are equivocal. RDA vitamin supplementation, non-Chinese herbals, homeopathic remedies, and antifungal therapy have no systematic data in ADHD. Megadose multivitamin combinations are probably ineffective for most patients and are possibly dangerous. Simple sugar restriction seems ineffective. Amino acid supplementation is mildly effective in the short term, but not beyond 2-3 months. Thyroid treatment is effective in the presence of documented thyroid abnormality. Some alternative Tx of ADHD are effective or probably effective, but mainly for certain patients. In some [Dietary deficiency of vitamin A among rural children: A Ranjan 2017-01-01 Overt vitamin A deficiency has been controlled in most parts of India, but prevalence of subclinical deficiency may still be high, which may enhance susceptibility to infections, reduce growth potential and also lead to higher mortality. We aimed to: (i) assess the consumption pattern of vitamin A-rich foods in children 1-5 years of age in rural Jammu; and (ii) estimate the dietary deficiency of vitamin A leading to risk of subclinical vitamin A deficiency in cluster- villages of the study area. In 2011, we conducted a survey of 750 children by selecting 50 from each of the 1 5 clusters. The Helen Keller International's Food-Frequency Questionnaire (HKI-FFQ) modified to the local context was used to assess past week's intake for 28 food-items, including vitamin A-rich foods. The study revealed that plant sources such as amaranth, carrots, etc. and animal sources such as eggs and butter were the major sources of vitamin A in the study population. Consumption of amaranth (2.7 days/week) and carrots (1.7 days/week) was moderate but that of animal foods rich in vitamin A was low to negligible (1.1 day/week for eggs and 0.2 day/week for liver and fish combined). The majority (80%) of the cluster-villages manifested inadequate intake of vitamin A-rich foods, thereby making subclinical vitamin A deficiency a public health problem for the whole area. Faulty diets, improper breastfeeding practices, low coverage of vitamin A supplementation and high prevalence of undernutrition could be related to the observed subclinical deficiency. Dietary diversification by including both plant and animal sources of vitamin A in adequate amounts along with improved breastfeeding, better implementation of mega-dose vitamin A supplementation and minimizing undernutrition may help in lowering subclinical vitamin A deficiency. The HKI-FFQ may be used as a proxy indicator of vitamin A intake/status for identifying pockets at risk of subclinical vitamin A deficiency in resource [The effect of oral and parenteral vitamin D supplementation group two, the VAS (P = 0.001) decreased, the role physical (P = 0.009), and role emotional (P = 0.034) increased significantly; In group three, the TUG (P = 0.0001) and the VAS (P = 0.002) decreased, whereas the physical function (P = 0.0001) and role physical (0.001) increased significantly; In group four, the VAS (P = 0.007) decreased significantly. The megadose vitamin D administration increases quality of life, decreases pain, and improves functional mobility via po or im route in the elderly. "}
