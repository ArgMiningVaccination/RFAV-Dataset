Published 2012 Jul 4. doi:10.3389/fimmu.2012.00185 Complement -Innate Immune System Complement The complement system is very handily named as it does exactly as it says - it works alongside the immune system to help give it a boost. It consists of about 20 serum protein, the most important of which are: 1.C3aandC5afor recruiting phagocytes (chemo attractants) 2.C3bandC4bwhich are opsonins(makes antigen tasty) 3.C5-C9is responsible for helping to kill pathogens - these form the \"membrane attack complex\", which come together to form a pore (hole) in the cellular membrane of bacteria. This pore allows water to move into the bacteria causing it to swell and die. https://simplemed.co.uk/sub jects/infection/innate- immunity-intro3/2/2022 5 Innate Immune System IgM -forms pentamer which is better able to activate complement Keyt BA, Baliga R, Sinclair AM, Carroll SF, Peterson MS.
