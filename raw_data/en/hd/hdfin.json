YES. COVID- 19 vaccines are safe and effective. Millions of people in the United States have received COVID- 19 vaccines, and these vaccines have undergone the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history. Before being authorized for use, all COVID- 19 vaccines were tested in clinical trials involving tens of thousands of people to make sure they met safety standards and protected adults of different ages, races, and ethnicities. There were no serious safety concerns in the trials. CDC and the FDA continue to monitor the vaccines to make sure they are safe. Is it better to get immunity to COVID-19 from a vaccine rather than natural immunity? YES. While you may have some short- term protection after recovering from COVID- 19, we don't know how long this protection lasts. Vaccination is the best protection. People who get COVID- 19 can have serious illnesses, and some have debilitating symptoms that persist for months.Can the vaccine give me COVID-19? NO. None of the COVID- 19 vaccines currently used or in development in the United States contain the live virus that causes COVID- 19. This means that a COVID- 19 vaccine cannot make you sick with COVID- 19. If I already had COVID-19 and recovered, do I still need to get vaccinated? YES. Y ou should get vaccinated even if you have already had COVID- 19. While you may have some short-term protection after recovering from COVID- 19, we don't know how long this protection will last. Will the flu vaccine protect me against COVID-19? NO. These are two different vaccines. Getting a flu vaccine will not protect you against COVID- 19. But the flu vaccine can prevent you from getting influenza at the same time as COVID- 19. This can keep you from having a more severe illness.sf.gov/ CovidVaccine Updated Feb. 9, 2021Do I need to wear a mask and avoid close contact with others if I have received the full vaccine? YES. The first vaccines approved in the US are about 95% effective in preventing sickness from COVID- 19. However, we do not know how well they prevent infections that do not cause symptoms. This means that we do not know how common it is for a person who got the vaccine to carry the virus and transmit it to others, including those who have increased risk for severe illness or death. Therefore, it is still very important for those who are vaccinated, and for the rest of the population who waits for their vaccines, to continue using all the tools available to help stop this pandemic: Wear a mask that covers your mouth and nose when outside your home Avoid gatherings Avoid being indoors with people you don't live with Stay at least 6 feet away from others Wash your hands often after touching shared objects or touching your face These tools, together with COVID- 19 vaccination, will offer the best protection from getting ill and spreading COVID- 19. Will the vaccine affect my DNA? NO. The vaccines do not affect or interact with our DNA in any way. mRNA never enters the nucleus of the cell, which is where our DNA (genetic material) is kept.I heard this rumor about a microchip\u2014is there anything to that? NO. We know many people have questions about the vaccine, and there have been examples where misinformation has been spread about the vaccine, such as this false rumor about \"microchip\" tracking. There is no vaccine \"microchip\" and this false rumor is not based in fact. Can people still get the vaccine if they want to have children in the future? YES. People who want to get pregnant in the future can receive the COVID- 19 vaccine when it becomes available to them. Based on current knowledge, medical experts believe the COVID- 19 vaccines are unlikely to pose a short or long-term risk to those wanting to become pregnant. What are the side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine? The most common side effects from this vaccine have included fatigue, muscle pains, joint pains, fever, headaches, pain and redness at the vaccination site, occur within the first 3 days of vaccination, and resolve within 1-3 days of onset. These symptoms are more common after the second dose of the vaccine and the majority of side effects are mild. Side effects are signs that the vaccine is working to build immunity. "}
