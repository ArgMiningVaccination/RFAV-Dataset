The College fosters the growth of the osteopathic profession by training physicians throughprograms of study guided by osteopathic medical tradition, concept and practice. PCOM is committed to the advancement of knowledge and intellectual growth through teaching and research, and to the well-being of the community through leadership and service. EDUCATIONAL GOALS The College's educational goals focus on presenting high-quality, comprehensive programs of study that embrace the following expectations of student learning: - Students will demonstrate a central core of biomedical or behavioral science knowledge in their field of study, including theory, foundations, clinical skills and applied clinical/practical application as appropriate to the specificacademic program. - Students will demonstrate communication skills through clinical assessments, group discussion and/or written or oral presentation in their respective fields. - Students will demonstrate an understanding of scientific inquiry by designing, conducting, presenting or interpreting research in their field of study and appropriate to their academic program. - Students will identify, retrieve, understand, analyze, synthesize and apply information collected from various sources and in varied formats, including those sources requiring skills in the use of information technology. - Students will develop a recognition of their legal and ethical obligations as professionals and will be able to apply an understanding of public policy and the social, cultural and economic factors that impact their field of study. GEORGIA BRANCH CAMPUS FOCUS The primary focus of Georgia Campus - PCOM is to recruit and educate students from Georgia and the surrounding states. The Georgia Campus seeks to retain graduate osteopathic physicians, pharmacists, biomedical scientists and other health care professionals in the southeast, to serve the health needs of the region and advance the professions of osteopathic medicine and pharmacy. 4INSTITUTIONAL DIVERSITY STATEMENT As active citizens in a multicultural world, the PCOM community cultivates an environment of inquiry, inquisitiveness and respect, promotes discovery and celebration of our differences and fosters appreciation of the rich social fabric that binds us together. THE COLLEGE When osteopathic schools were forming throughout the country in the 1890s, two students at the Northern Institute of Osteopathy in Minneapolis, Mason W.Pressly and Oscar John Snyder, targeted Philadelphia as a future home for an osteopathic medical college. Although the City of Brotherly Love had a rich history of medicine, it had but one \"osteopathist\" by the time Pressly and Snyder graduated in 1898 and 1899, respectively. PCOM's founders were outspoken, pioneering physicians who explored and taught the use of manipulative therapy in the prevention of disease long before the use of penicillin and modern drugs.The two young osteopathic physicians followed through with their vision, incorporating the Philadelphia College and Infirmary of Osteopathy on January 24, 1899. The first PCIO degree was awarded to a transfer student; the first PCIO class, composed of two students, graduated in February 1900 from the fledglingCollege then located at 21 South 12th Street. The College prospered and moved through a number of sites in its first century, including 1715 North Broad Street, 832 Pine Street, 19th and Spring Garden, 48th and Spruce, and finally, City Avenue. During this growth period, the medical curriculum intensified, osteopathic research was initiated, and clinic and hospital services grew rapidly as the medical school's student body and faculty expanded dramatically. After nearly a century of training physicians, PCOM opened its first graduate degree program, the Master of Science in Biomedical Sciences, in 1993. The first five graduates in June 1995 marked the beginning of yet another period of growth for the College - the development of a graduate school. Today, more than 800 graduate students are enrolled in PCOM's master's and doctoral degree programs. PCOM's graduate students pursue studies at the master's level in biomedical sciences, mental health counseling, school psychology, organizational development, forensic medicine and physician assistant studies. Doctoral-level study is offered in clinical psychology and school psychology with certificate programs for professionals seeking respecialization in clinical psychology or certification as school psychologists. In August 2005, the first entering osteopathic medical class began its studies at Georgia Campus - Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine (GA-PCOM), the College's branch campus located in Suwanee, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta. GA-PCOM's mission is to help fill the need for more physicians and other health professionals in Georgia and the surrounding states, areas that have been affected 56by population increases and subsequent shortages. The Master of Science in Biomedical Sciences program was established at the Georgia Campus in the 2006-2007 academic year, and the PCOM School of Pharmacy opened at the Georgia Campus in Fall 2010. The osteopathic medical programs train students who will become skilled, caring and successful physicians guided by the strengths of osteopathic principles refined during a century of medical practice, teaching and research. More than 60,000 osteopathic physicians practicing today are an integral part of America's health care delivery system. Today, all treatment modalities are available to osteopathic physicians, who may prescribe drugs, perform surgery and specializein any area of medicine. DOs, whose primary care training prepares them to be highly skilled diagnosticians, are represented throughout the United States and in all branches of military service. Nearly 70 percent of main campus students are Pennsylvanians, and 75 percent of Georgia Campus students are from the southeastern states. More than 200 colleges and 21 states are represented in the student body. Supported by the best modern technology, PCOM emphasizes a practitioner-scholar approach and community orientation in all of its degree programs to prepare students for the new challenges facing the behavioral and the medical sciences in the 21stcentury.7DEGREES AND CERTIFICATES AWARDED Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) - Philadelphia and Georgia Campuses Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) - Georgia Campus Doctor of Psychology (PsyD) - Clinical Psychology - Philadelphia CampusDoctor of Psychology (PsyD) - School Psychology - Philadelphia Campus Master of Science in Mental Health Counseling (MS) - Philadelphia Campus Master of Science in Counseling and Clinical Health Psychology (MS) - Philadelphia CampusMaster of Science in Counseling and Psychology Studies (MS) - Philadelphia CampusMaster of Science in School Psychology (MS) - Philadelphia Campus Educational Specialist in School Psychology (EdS) - Philadelphia Campus Master of Science in Organizational Development and Leadership (MS) - Philadelphia Campus Certificate of Graduate Studies: Applied Behavior Analysis Organizational Development and Leadership - Philadelphia and Georgia Campuses Certificate of Advanced Graduate Studies: Cognitive Behavior Therapy, Applied Behavior Analysis, Professional Counseling and Organizational Development and Analysis - Philadelphia Campus Post-Doctoral Certificates in Clinical Health Psychology and Clinical Neuropsychology - Philadelphia Campus Master of Science in Biomedical Sciences (MS) - Philadelphia and Georgia CampusesMaster of Science in Health Sciences - Physician Assistant Studies (MS) - Philadelphia Campus Master of Science in Forensic Medicine (MS) - Philadelphia Campus Clinical Master of Science (MSc) - Philadelphia Campus Respecialization in School Psychology - Philadelphia Campus Respecialization in Clinical Psychology - Philadelphia Campus Matriculation and Degree Conferral Matriculation and attendance at the College are privileges granted to the student in consideration of performance of specified assignments and the maintenance of established standards of personal and professional conduct.

Acceptance by the Faculty Committee on Admissions is based on the applicant's fulfillment of undergraduate course requirements, grade point average (GPA), Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) scores, pre-health advisor letter of recommendation and a personal interview with the committee. PCOM seeks well-rounded, achievement-oriented persons whose character, maturity and sense of dedication point to a productive life as an osteopathic physician. PCOM is an institution that has historically sought diversity in its student population and actively recruits under-represented minority students and non-traditional students, including veterans, who often offer exceptional potential for becoming outstanding physicians. Requirements for Admission Prior to matriculation at either campus site, each applicant must meet the following PCOM admission requirements. 1. Satisfactory completion of a bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited college or university is necessary. Applications from students with three years of exceptional undergraduate work completed may be considered. 2. The satisfactory completion of these specific undergraduate semester hours must be demonstrated by the applicant. - Eight semester hours each, including two semester hours of laboratory: biology and physics. - Sixteen semester hours of chemistry course work (including labs), four credits of which must be organic chemistry. - Six semester hours of English composition and literature. 3. Each applicant must sit for the Medical College Admission Test, which is given multiple times each year. Prospective students are urged to take the test as early as possible and certainly not later than December of the year prior to desired matriculation. The MCAT must be taken within three years of desired matriculation. Application Steps and Schedule All inquiries about admission to the DO program should be directed to PCOM's Office of Admissions. PCOM participates in the centralized online application service for the colleges of osteopathic medicine, AACOMAS. 151. Beginning in May, prospective osteopathic medical students may submit their application through a secure Web server, AACOMAS-Online, at www.aacom.org. The AACOMAS application should be complete and indicate the campuses to which the prospective osteopathic medical student isapplying. The application must be accompanied by the required fee. Theapplication will be processed once all official transcripts and MCAT scores arereceived and verified by AACOMAS. 2. When the processed application is received in the PCOM Admissions Office from AACOMAS, applicants will receive a PCOM supplemental application via electronic notification to their e-mail address as provided on the AACOMASapplication. This electronic form must be completed, signed and returned foreach campus application. PCOM requires an application fee of $75 for eachcampus applied to. 3. A letter of recommendation/packet from the pre-health or academic advisor/committee (undergraduate, post-baccalaureate or graduate programs). This is preferred by the DO Faculty Committee on Admissions OR Three faculty letters of recommendation: twoof those three letters must be from basic science professors (undergraduate, post-baccalaureate or graduate programs). 4. A letter of recommendation from an osteopathic physician is strongly suggested but not required. 5. All applications and transcripts to AACOMAS must be submitted no later than February 1 of the year of desired matriculation. PCOM supplemental applications and all supporting credentials must be received in the Admissions Office by March 1. Early application and fulfillment of all credential requirements is strongly recommended, since a rolling admissions process is followed with review of applications beginning in July. Interviews Each campus has a PCOM Faculty Committee on Admissions that will review all completed applications, select those applicants to be interviewed and inform them in writing, via e-mail, of the interview date, time and place. Although all applicants who are eventually accepted must be interviewed, the granting of an interview should not be construed as evidence of final acceptance. Interviews generally begin in September for the Philadelphia Campus and October for the Georgia Campus and continue through the end of March. Interview sessions are conducted in the morning or the afternoon. During the course of the morning or afternoon, applicants may have an opportunity to meet with a student ambassador, sit in on classes and tour the campus. PCOM conducts a panel interview that generally includes the applicant and other members of the committee, and lasts about one half hour. 16Admissions Decisions Interviewed candidates are usually notified within five weeks from the date of interview. Accepted applicants are asked to send a $250 non-refundable tuition prepayment according to the following schedule: - Those accepted prior to November 15 will have until December 14. - Those accepted between November 15 and January 14 will have 30 days.- Those accepted between January 14 and May 14 will have 14 days.- Those accepted on or after May 15 may be asked for an immediate deposit. An additional deposit of $1,500 is required by April 15 from all confirmed students. This fee is non-refundable and, along with the initial $250 deposit, willbe credited to the student's tuition account. PCOM does not have an Early Decision Program.To ensure that students accepted to PCOM will be permitted to perform clerkships during their third and fourth clinical years, and thus ensure them the opportunity to successfully complete their DO degree requirements, PCOM now requires all first year students to complete a criminal background check prior tomatriculation. All students must have their criminal background checksprocessed through PreCheck. The Admissions Office must have this informationon file prior to orientation; students will not be allowed to start classes without this information. Transfer Students and Advanced Standing PCOM does not routinely accept transfer students; however, a transfer application may be considered under extenuating circumstances and depending on places available in the class. Consideration will be given only to a student who is in good standing at an AOA-accredited college of osteopathic medicine and has completed two years of study, or who is eligible for re-admission to the previously attended college of osteopathic medicine. COMLEX 1 must have a passing grade prior to matriculation at PCOM if the student is accepted by the Faculty Committee on Admissions. The initial request for transfer must originate from the dean of the college or university from which the student wishes to transfer and must be directed to the dean of the PCOM campus to which he or she is applying. Application materials must be submitted, and a formal interview with the Faculty Committee on Admissions will be required. If accepted, a transfer student will be given credit for courses successfully passed at the previous college that meet PCOM's curriculum requirements. A minimum of two years must be completed at PCOM for a student to be eligible to receive the DO degree. 17For all other students entering the DO program, PCOM does not grant advanced standing or credit for prior learning or for courses completed at other institutions.. Technical Standards for Matriculation All PCOM applicants and enrolled students must meet the technical standards set forth below. Accepted candidates are asked to review and acknowledge PCOM'stechnical standards for admission and matriculation. The holder of a DO degree must have the knowledge and skills to function in a broad variety of clinical situations and to render a wide spectrum of patient care. In order to carry out the activities described below, candidates for the DO degree must be able to consistently, quickly and accurately integrate all information received, and they must have the ability to learn, integrate, analyze, and synthesize data in the classroom and clinical settings. All students mustdemonstrate the competencies required by faculty and must have the capabilities to complete their course of study in a reasonably independent manner. The standards are: Observation and Sensory Skills: Candidates and students must have sufficient vision to be able to observe demonstrations, experiments and laboratory exercises in the basic sciences. They must be able to observe a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand for proper evaluation and treatment integration. Communication Skills: Candidates and students should be able to speak, hear and observe patients in order to elicit information, examine patients, describe changes in mood, activity and posture, and perceive non-verbal communications. They must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively with patients. Communication includes not only speech but also reading and writing. They must also be able to communicate effectively and efficiently in oral and written form with all members of the health care team. Motor Skills: Candidates and students should have sufficient motor function and strength and mobility to execute movements required to provide general care and emergency treatment to patients. Examples of emergency treatment required of physicians are cardiopulmonary resuscitation, administration of intravenous medication, the application of pressure to stop bleeding, the opening of obstructed airways, the suturing of simple wounds, and the performance of simple obstetrical maneuvers. Such actions require coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium and functional use of the senses of touch and vision. Additionally, to perform osteopathic manipulation, upright posture with sufficient lower extremity and body strength is required. Conceptual, Integrative and Quantitative Skills : These skills include measurement, calculation, reasoning, analysis and synthesis. Problem solving, the critical skill demanded of physicians, requires all of these intellectual abilities. In addition, candidates and students should be able to comprehend three-dimensional relationships and to understand the spatial relationships of structures. 18Behavioral and Social Skills: Candidates and students must possess the emotional health required for full utilization of their intellectual abilities, the exercise of good judgment, the prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the diagnosis and care of patients, and the development of mature, sensitive and effective relationships with patients. Candidates and students must be able totolerate physically taxing workloads and to adapt to changing environments, to display flexibility and to learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in the clinical problems of many patients. Compassion, integrity, concern for others,interpersonal skills, interest and motivation are all personal qualities that will beassessed during the admissions and the educational processes. Technical Standards for Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine and Physical Diagnosis A core component of osteopathic medical education is using touch for diagnosisand therapeutic purposes. To acquire competencies in physical diagnosis andosteopathic manipulative medical diagnosis and treatment, all students are required to touch others and to be touched. The College realizes that emergencies may occur after matriculation, and will address these concerns as the need arises.Professional Expectations Students are expected to adhere to a standard of behavior and conduct consistentwith the high standards of the healing and scientific profession. All students areexpected to: 1. Respect the right of their fellow students to pursue their studies in a professional environment conducive to study. 2. Maintain professional interpersonal relationships by demonstrating civility and respect for each other. 3. Uphold the highest standard of academic honesty and integrity. 4. Show respect for the diversity that exists among students, faculty and patients in regard to disability, social background, age, gender, religious beliefs, race, sexual orientation and particular disease process. 5. Fulfill their responsibilities to their peers and patients in group work, including clinical clerkships and outside training assignments. 6. Adhere to all of the policies of the College, including those prohibiting discrimination or harassment. PCOM maintains a curriculum that stresses the importance of the body as a unit, and the applicability of touch as an integral part of diagnosis and therapy for all patients of both genders. As part of this training, students will participate in 1920physical examination and osteopathic manipulative treatment by fellow students. This physical examination is critical to learning the skills required of practicing osteopathic physicians; therefore, it is mandatory that all matriculating students understand and accept these responsibilities. These responsibilities include: 1. Adhere to appropriate dress as determined by the faculty, e.g., gym shorts, tee shirt, sports bra, as necessary to participate in the physical examination experience. 2. Allow other students to see and touch them so that all become proficient in physical diagnosis and manipulative treatment. 3. Assume the role of the patient to develop an understanding of the patient experience. 4. Demonstrate professional demeanor at all times. Students also understand that they are required to meet all of the standards and expectations for classroom testing and assessment. English Proficiency Requirement Every applicant whose native language is not English, or whose undergraduate instruction was not in English, must provide an English proficiency test score. Any applicant whose native language is not English must demonstrate objective competency in English by satisfactory performance on the Test of English as aForeign Language (TOEFL). A score is considered too old, and will not beaccepted, if it is more than two years old from the start of the applicant's admissions term. Country of citizenship does not exempt applicants from this requirement. Language of instruction at the college or university level, and howrecent it has been, are the determining factors in meeting this requirement. The minimum required score for the IBT (Internet Based Testing) is 79 and a minimum score of 26 is required for the speaking component. General writing assistance is available for theses and dissertations; however, as an institution offering only graduate and professional programs, PCOM does not offer remedial ESL coursework. Applicants are exempt if: 1. English is the exclusive language of instruction at the undergraduate level; or 2. The student has earned a degree from a regionally accredited U.S. college or university not more than five years prior to the anticipated semester of enrollment; or 3. The student has completed at least two full-time semesters of graded coursework, exclusive of ESL courses, in a U.S. college or university, or at an institution outside the U.S. where English is the exclusive language of instruction, not more than five years prior to the anticipated semester of enrollment.21International Applicants/Non-U.S. Citizens International Applicants An international applicant is an applicant who is not a United States citizen or permanent resident (green card holder) of the United States.

Early application and fulfillment of all requirements are strongly recommended, because a rolling admissions process is followed with review of completed applications beginning in early Fall. Interviews All applications are processed in Philadelphia, PA; however, interviews are conducted at the PCOM School of Pharmacy in Suwanee, Georgia and are scheduled by e-mail using the e-mail address indicated on the student's admissions application. PCOM School of Pharmacy may also conduct face-to- face interviews at designated off-campus locations as needed.

Students are required to present a valid government-issued ID upon arrival. During the course of the interview sessions, applicants will have an opportunity to meet with a representative from the Financial Aid Office and tour the campus.

Accepted applicants are asked to send a non-refundable $500 tuitionprepayment that will be credited to the student's tuition account. The School of Pharmacy may participate in an Early Decision Program through PharmCAS. Details on Early Decision Programs can be found on the PCOM School ofPharmacy PharmCAS web page. PCOM requires all first year students to successfully complete both a criminal background check and drug screen prior to matriculation. The Office of the Dean must have this information on file prior to orientation; students will not be allowed to start classes without this information. Confirmed students will be notified as to how and when to begin the process. PCOM School of Pharmacy does not routinely accept transfer students; however, a transfer application may be considered under extenuating circumstances and depending on availability. Consideration will be given only to a student who is in good standing at an ACPE-accredited college or school of pharmacy or who is eligible for readmission to the previously attended college or school. Studentswho have been on probation, suspended or involved in any adverse action as a result of conduct violations or academic dishonesty are not eligible for transfer. To initiate a transfer, students should send a letter detailing the reason for the transfer request to the PCOM School of Pharmacy, Associate Dean for Academics and Assessment along with an official transcript of all coursework in the college/school of pharmacy and a letter from the Dean of the college/school of pharmacy that the student is currently enrolled in stating that the student is currently in good standing and has never been on probation, suspended or had any adverse action taken as a result of conduct violations or academic dishonesty. A formal interview with the Admissions Committee will be required and the committee will decide whether to accept the transfer student and grant, if appropriate, credit for courses successfully completed at the previous college/school that meet PCOM's curriculum requirements. A minimum of two years must be completed at PCOM School of Pharmacy for a student to be eligible to receive the PharmD degree. A Technical Standards form must be completed by all admitted applicants to notify the College if they are not capable of satisfying the technical standards based on an ADA-recognized disability (which may be physical, cognitive, sensory, or psychological in nature). PCOM will respond to any such notice with a statement of the reasonable disability accommodations, if any, that it can offer to assist the prospective student in completing the educational program. Official matriculation into the degree program cannot be confirmed unless and until PCOM responds to the notice with the reasonable accommodations it can offer and the student accepts those conditions of enrollment. If other factors such as personal preferences, cultural traditions or religious25requirements would preclude the applicant from meeting the technical standards, the applicant may not request disability accommodations on this form, as these factors do not relate to an ADA-recognized disability. However, if such factors apply, the applicant is strongly advised to contact the Office of Diversity to discuss the issues and request accommodation prior to confirminghis/her acceptance. While such requests will be reviewed and considered, there is no assurance that an accommodation will be offered.

All courses are defined on the basis of credit hours forwhich one credit hour is equal to 14 hours of classroom or classroom equivalent instruction, exclusive of final examinations. Grading Policy Course coordinators determine the means by which the final grade will becomputed, which may include exam scores, written assignments, laboratoryexercises, practical examinations, class participation and other means ofevaluation. Courses are graded in accordance with the following system: Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine program grading structure is on a numeric scale from 0-100 for the first two years with 70 being a passing grade. There are a few courses in the first and second year that are Pass/Fail courses. In the clinicalyears the grading structure is Honors Pass, High Pass and Pass. Doctor of Pharmacy Program Doctor of Pharmacy program grade point average is based on a 4.0 scale. Doctor of Pharmacy grading structure is as follows: Grade Quality Points Percentage A 4.0 90 - 100 B 3.0 80 - less than 90 C 2.0 70 - less than 80 D 1.0 65 - less than 70 F 0.0 less than 65 P Pass (does not affect the GPA) The Pass-Fail grading policy is only applicable to those courses that are graded on the pass or fail basis. It does not apply to those courses that are graded on the letter grading scale. For letter grade determination, the final percentage earned in the class will be rounded to the nearest whole number. Cumulative GPA will be based upon the grades earned during the first, second and third professional years only. Graduate and PsyD Programs Graduate and PsyD programs grade point average is based on a 4.0 scale. Graduate and doctoral programs grading structure is as follows: 5758Quality Grade Points Percentage A 4.00 95 - 100 Superior level of competency A- 3.67 90 - 94 B+ 3.33 85 - 89 B 3.00 80 - 84; Satisfactory level of competency B- 2.67 77 - 79 C+ 2.33 74 - 76; Marginal level of competency C 2.00 70 - 73; Marginal level of competency F 0.00 0 - 69; Failure to demonstrate a marginal level of competency; F does not count towards the total number of credits required for the program. IP Incomplete pending is a grade granted only in Psychology Research courses when the instructor and program director deem additional time needed to complete the course. IP must be completed within the next term in the time period designated by the instructor and program director. HP Superior level of competency in practicum seminar P Satisfactory or marginal level of competency in practicum seminar S Satisfactory level of progress in dissertation seminar or biomedical research U Unsatisfactory level of progress in dissertationseminar or biomedical research Grades Common to All Programs:I Incomplete: An incomplete grade must be requested by the student in writing, in advance of the end of the course. If the instructor approves the request, a written agreement is made regarding the work required and the due date. The new grade must be sent to the Registrar within six weeks of the last class. Failure to complete the assignment within six weeks will result in the Incomplete being changed to a grade of F The only exception is in Psychology where it is required that Independent Study courses and Assessment I or II must be completed by the end of late registration in order to be eligible for enrollmentin the next term's course sequence. W Withdrawal before midpoint of the term of a course; once the midpoint of a term has been reached, a student is noteligible to withdraw unless there are extenuating circumstances and the student is granted permission WP Withdrawal after the midpoint of a course while passing WF Withdrawal after the midpoint of a course while failing or unauthorized withdrawal AU Audited (no course credit) Grade Point AverageThe grade point average is calculated by dividing the total credits attempted (excluding grades of HP, S, P, WP, WF, I, AU, W) into the sum of the products of points and credits for all courses taken. Only courses taken at PCOM are included in this calculation. Grade Reports Grades are available to all students at the end of each term via the Banner Web services in Nucleus. PCOM does not distribute paper mailers. Dropping of Courses The deadline to drop a course is the last day of the first week of the term.Students who drop a course by this deadline will receive a 100% tuition refund. Students enrolled in the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine, the Doctor of Pharmacy and the Physician Assistant programs are not permitted to drop one course, but are required to drop all coursework in that term. Because of the sequential nature of these programs, students requesting to be dropped from one term may be required to take a leave of absence until the following year. In these programs, consultation and approval from the program dean or program director is required. Withdrawal From Courses After Drop-Add Period Withdrawals occur after the first week of the term. While students in other graduate programs may be permitted to withdraw from a course, it should be done with the consultation of their program director or dean. Withdrawals may change the sequence of courses to be taken. Students approved to take a withdrawal from a course up to the midpoint of a course will earn a grade notation of Withdraw. After the midpoint of the course, students will not be eligible to withdraw from a course unless there are extenuating circumstances and they are given permission from their program director or dean. The latter option will be reserved for extreme circumstances only. Course withdrawals approved after the midpoint of the course will carry a grade notation of WP if withdrawing when passing, or a grade notation of WF if withdrawing when failing. 59Students may not continue in the program with more than one WF grade notation. Withdrawal grades or credits are not calculated in the grade pointaverage. Auditing Courses A course audit does not provide the student with any course credit nor can it be used toward degree requirements. A course audit is noted on the transcript with a grade of AU and does not calculate into the GPA. When auditing a course the student is required to actively participate in labs, group assignments and to take examinations. For a student to audit a course, permission must be received from the dean or the program director at the beginning of the term and submitted to the Registrar's Office. Audited coursework will not be eligible for federal financial aid. Veteran Information Contact with the Veterans Administration and negotiation of problems related to veterans benefits are handled in the Registrar's Office. Application for benefits atPCOM is generally initiated by filing a \"Change of Place of Training\" form uponleaving the prior institution, or upon separation from the Armed Forces. International Students InformationInternational students' paperwork is processed through the Registrar's Office. PCOM has been approved to process F-1 visas. Prior to the start of their first term, international students must submit tuition for the duration of the program. These funds will be placed in a PCOM escrow account. International students must be enrolled full time each term and continue to make academic progress. Transfer Credit Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine The Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine program does not routinely accept transfer students; however, transfer application may be considered under extenuating circumstances and depending on placement available in the class. Consideration will be given only to a student who is in good standing at an AOA-accredited college of osteopathic medicine. If accepted, a transfer student will be given credit for courses successfully passed at the previous college that meet PCOM's curriculum requirements. A minimum of two years must be completed at PCOM for a student to be eligible to receive the DO degree. Doctor of Pharmacy PCOM School of Pharmacy does not routinely accept transfer students; however, a transfer application may be considered under extenuating circumstances and depending on places available in the class. Consideration will be given only to a student who is in good standing at an ACPE-accredited college or school of pharmacy who is eligible for re-admission to the previously attended college or school. The initial request for transfer must originate from the dean of the college 60or school of pharmacy from which the student wishes to transfer and must be directed to the dean of the PCOM School of Pharmacy - Georgia Campus. Application materials must be submitted and a formal interview with the Admissions Committee will be required. If accepted, a transfer student will be given credit for courses successfully passed at the previous college that meet PCOM's curriculum requirements. A minimum of two years must be completed at PCOM for a student to be eligible to receive the PharmD degree. Graduate ProgramsGraduate programs may permit transfer credits provided the student meetsPCOM's curriculum requirements and upon approval of the academic department. A graduate student will be given permission to transfer to PCOM nomore than six graduate-level credits for coursework successfully completed at a previous college. Doctoral Programs Doctoral-level students are not permitted to transfer any prior coursework toPCOM. Attendance Policy Students are strongly recommended to attend all classes to maximize their educational experience by participating in and following their discussions first-hand. Individual course directors may set attendance standards for their course, including the designation of mandatory lectures, and may implement in-class quizzes or record attendance. Thus, attendance may be a factor in determiningthe final grade in a course, at the discretion of the course director. One-hundred percent attendance is required in clinical clerkships, remedial assignments, laboratory sessions, small-group sessions, clinical correlations and standardized patient exercises, and all introductory and advanced pharmacy practical experiences. Serious excuses for missed attendance must be documented and reported to the Chief Student Affairs officer in Philadelphia or the Director of the Center for Student Affairs in Georgia for first and second year DO students or to clinical education for third and fourth year DO students, who in turn will advise the course or clerkship director for his or her consideration. Students in other degree programs should report and document their absence to the head of their program. Final determination to accept an excuse remains with the course or clerkship director. Extended absences for illness, family emergencies, etc., must always be documented by the Chief Student Affairs officer in Philadelphia and the Director of the Center for Student Affairs in Georgia, clinical education, or the office of the specific academic program. Academic Progress Evaluation Student scholastic achievement is reviewed on an ongoing basis by each 61program's Student Progress Evaluation Committee (SPEC). The SPEC Committees make recommendations on student academic standing to the Student Academic Progress and Policy Committee (SAPPC). Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine In the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine program the extent of a student's academic deficiency considers the accumulation of academic standing units.Assignment of academic standing units to courses or clerkships not successfullycompleted is based on course credits or number of clerkship weeks using thefollowing formula: Courses worth less than 1 credit hour to 3 credit hours = .25 Academic Units Courses worth more than 3 credit hours to 8 credit hours = .50 Academic Units Courses worth more than 8 credit hours = 1.00 Academic Units Clerkships 2 weeks in length = .50 Academic Units Clerkships 4 weeks in length = 1.00 Academic Units Students' performance is reviewed at the end of each term. Students with unsatisfactory academic achievement will be counseled regarding their performance. A student with a failure in one academic standing unit will be recommended by the Student Academic Progress and Policy Committee to the Dean for promotion from one class to the next when the student has removed the deficiency. Students who have accumulated one or more academic standing units of coursefailures may not be eligible for validation examination and may not be eligible foradvancement to the next year of study. Students with one or more academic standing units of course failures may be dismissed from the academic program of the College or required to repeat a year of study, at the discretion of the Student Academic Progress and Policy Committee. If a student is afforded the opportunity to repeat the year of study, they do so on probation and will not be allowed to appeal should another failure occur. A review of a student's complete academic performance may be considered in determination of dismissal. Students who fail a clerkship and have had prior academic failures in their didactic years may be liable for dismissal. Students who have not had prior failures in their didactic years and receive more than one failure in a clerkship may be liable for dismissal. When considering a student for dismissal from the DO program all performances can be reviewed. Doctor of Pharmacy In the Doctor of Pharmacy program, a student must receive a minimum 62cumulative grade point average of 2.0 to graduate. The minimum grade required to pass pharmacy coursework is a D. The School of Pharmacy Academic Performance and Standards Committee reviews all student academic progression. When a student violates the progression guidelines, the Academic Performance and Standards Committee evaluates the case and submits a recommendation letter to the Student Policy and Progress Committee. This Committee reviews the case and reports its decision to the School of PharmacyDean, who generates the appropriate decision letter. The committee determines the extent of academic deficiency by considering specific academic guidelines. Numerous parameters exist that help to maintain proper alignment of academic expectations while describing consequences of failure to achieve these requirements. The progression guidelines also define academic probation, dismissal criteria and steps that must be undertaken to graduate from the pharmacy program. A student in the Doctor of Pharmacy program who has failed a course must remediate the class during the following summer. The grade earned through remediation will be averaged with the original F for calculation of the final GPA. Only one course may be remediated. Students may not progress to the next academic year until remediated coursework is successfully completed. For purposes of this policy, an F in a pass-fail course is treated as an F with regard to overall academic progression and thus must be repeated. Dismissal The Academic Performance and Standards Committee may recommend dismissal from the PCOM School of Pharmacy following review of any student that comes before the committee and will automatically recommend student dismissal from the School of Pharmacy under any one of the following conditions: - Failure to maintain a current, valid State of Georgia Pharmacy Intern License - Receiving three grades less than C for all courses taken at PCOM School of Pharmacy - A grade of D, F, NP or WF is considered to be a grade less than C - Failure to successfully remediate a course on the first attempt - Failure to attain a cumulative GPA greater than or equal to 2.0 at the end of a repeated professional year A student dismissed from the PCOM School of Pharmacy may appeal this decision according to the policies set forth in the PCOM General Student Handbook under the section Appealing an Academic Dismissal Decision. Academic Probation Probation is an action taken in the interest of the student. A student who is placed on probation should carefully evaluate his/her chance of success in earning a degree in Pharmacy from PCOM School of Pharmacy if his/her current 63strategy continues. At a minimum, a student should arrange to substantially increase the amount of time and effort devoted to academic preparedness. Students are immediately placed on academic probation under any one of the following conditions: - Term or cumulative GPA less than 2.0 at the end of any term - Receive a course grade of F, NP or WF- Upon recommendation by the Academic Progression and Standards Committee The probationary period is the academic term immediately following, unless theAcademic Performance and Standards Committee specifies a longer probationaryperiod. Removal from probation only occurs if the student has, at the end of the probationary period, attained a term and cumulative GPA greater than2.0, received a grade of P in all P/NP courses during the probation period, and successfully remediated all courses with a grade of F or NP and met any other conditions imposed by the Academic Performance and Standards Committee. All students on probation are required to make an appointment with theAssociate Dean for Academics and Assessment during the first week of each probationary term to develop a plan to help improve their academicperformance. Students on probation are not permitted to serve as an officer of any student organization affiliated with PCOM or PCOM School of Pharmacy or attend any non-mandatory PCOM School of Pharmacy-sponsored activity. Academic Probation When the Semester or Cumulative GPA Is Less than 2.0If a student is placed on academic probation as a result of his or her semester or cumulative GPA dropping below 2.0, then the probationary period is the following semester. At the end of the probationary period, the student must have a semester and cumulative GPA of 2.0 or better. Failure to do so will result in the student being reviewed by the School of Pharmacy Academic Performance and Standards Committee for consideration of the following options, including but not limited to (1) recommendation for dismissal from the program or (2) repeat of the current professional year. The minimum GPA required to graduate from PCOM is 2.0; therefore, if the cumulative GPA is less than 2.0 at the end of the third professional year the student will not be allowed to progress into the fourth professional year. The student will be reviewed by the School of Pharmacy Academic Performance and Standards Committee for consideration of the following options, including but not limited to (1) recommendation for dismissal from the program or (2) repeat of the third professional year. If the Committee allows a repeat of the third academic year and the cumulative GPA remains below 2.0, the student will be dismissed from the program. 64Academic Probation with a Course Grade of F or WF A student who receives a single course grade of F or WF with a cumulative GPA less than 2.0 is placed on probation until the course is successfully remediated. Failure to successfully remediate the course results in dismissal from the program. Failed Experiential Rotations must be repeated at a date and time as determined at the discretion of the Director of Experiential Education. If a student receives two course grades of F or WF within any professional year, then the student is referred to the School of Pharmacy Academic Performance and Standards Committee for consideration of the following options, including but not limited to (1) recommendation for dismissal from the program, (2) repeat of the professional year or (3) remediation. If a student is allowed by the School of Pharmacy Academic Performance and Standards Committee to repeat the professional year (as determined by the curriculum) then the probationary period is his or her repeat year. The student is removed from probation after successful completion of the probationary year. Any student on probation for two or more of the previously stated reasons will automatically be referred to the School of Pharmacy Academic Performance and Standards Committee for review for consideration of the following options, including but not limited to (1) recommendation for dismissal or (2) repeat of the professional year. Successful removal from academic probation is achieved when the semester and cumulative GPA is greater than 2.0 at the end of the probationary semester. The student also is removed from academic probation during a repeated year when his/her semester and cumulative GPA is greater than 2.0. Review by the Academic Performance and Standards Committee A student is reviewed by the Academic Performance and Standards Committee under any of the following circumstances: - Failure to maintain a current, valid State of Georgia Pharmacy Intern License - Placed on academic probation - Remain on academic probation for two or more consecutive terms - Receive a course grade of D while on probation - Receive a course grade of F, NP or WF - Receive two course grades of D - Cumulative GPA less than 2.0 at the end of the third professional year The Academic Performance and Standards Committee will afford the student an opportunity to speak to the committee during its deliberations. The committee forwards its recommendation, along with a rationale for its decision, to the PCOM Academic Policy and Promotion Committee for review. The PCOM Academic Policy and Promotion Committee then forwards the recommendation to the Dean of the PCOM School of Pharmacy, who may impose sanctions 6566including academic probation, repeat of a single course, courses or an entire professional year or dismissal from the PCOM School of Pharmacy. Graduate Programs In the graduate programs, a grade of F (failure), U (unsatisfactory) or WF (withdrawal while failing) in any graduate course will make the student liable fordismissal from the program. A minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.0 is required for continuation to unconditional degree candidacy status, and conferral of the master of science degree. Doctoral Programs In the doctoral programs, a grade of F (failure) or WF (withdrawal while failing),or 3 grades of C or U (unsatisfactory) will make the student liable for dismissalfrom the program. Doctoral students must achieve a B average (3.0) or higher to take comprehensive exams and to graduate from the program. PsyD students may earn no more than two grades below a B- or more than one F in any course,required or elective. In addition, students must record a B- or better in all required courses. There are several courses that require the student to achieve a grade of B. The student may be required to retake the course. This information regarding which course(s) require(s) a grade of B is annotated under the course description in the Programand Course Description section of the catalog. Each degree program also has specific requirements regarding comprehensive examinations, licensure exam passage, practicum, internship and thesis and dissertation completion. These policies are explained in detail in the studenthandbook for the respective program. Categories of Academic Standing The categories of academic standing are as follows: Good Standing: Status of a student who has met course requirements in a satisfactory manner and has demonstrated professional behavior. Warning: A departmental written warning may be issued to any student who has incurred a course, clerkship or preceptorship failure(s) subject to a validation or remediation. Issuance of a letter of academic warning does not necessarily result in loss of good academic standing but is intended to alert the student that academic deficiencies have been recorded and must be remediated to meet promotion requirements. Probation: Status of a student who has demonstrated a marginal level of performance to the degree that any additional course deficiencies will make the student liable for dismissal according to College policy. Dismissal: Action, after review of the academic deficiency or deficiencies of a67student by the Student Academic Progress and Policy Committee, whereby a student may be dismissed from the academic program of the College. Academic Appeal A student who is dismissed for academic deficiency may appeal the decision. Such a request or appeal must be made to the Office of Academic Affairs withinfifteen business days after the student has been notified of the decision todismiss. Students may not bring before the Academic Appeal Committee requests other than an appeal of a permanent dismissal action. Any studentappealing a dismissal will be entitled to a hearing before the Academic Appeal Committee. The scope of the review shall not include a review of the components of a specific grade or grades. At the hearing, the student may present evidence on his or her behalf, and/or choose to be represented by an advisor or an attorney. The student must also provide a list of any witnesses he or she plans to call on his or her behalf and/orthe use of an attorney or other advisor at least ten days prior to the hearing. The student shall be given written notification of the final decision. A student will be permitted only one appeal.Change of Enrollment Status Leave of Absence A leave of absence is defined as a pre-approved leave from the institution that suspends a student's course of academic and/or clinical study or off-site trainingfor a definite period of time, not to exceed 12 months. When considering a leave of absence a student should consult with the Chief Student Affairs Officer at the Philadelphia Campus or the Director of the Center for Student Affairs at the Georgia Campus, and where applicable the student's Program Director to consider how a leave would affect his or her overall progress in the academic program of the College. Additional consultation with the Financial Aid Office is suggested for those students with financial aid to determine any financial ramifications. A leave of absence may be granted for one of the following reasons: (1) a medical or family emergency; (2) a financial emergency; (3) pursuit of an academic endeavor other than the regular classroom work or training assignment, either on campus or at another recognized teaching facility; (4) active military service. To receive consideration for a leave of absence, a student must submit to the appropriate Dean or Vice President of Graduate Programs a written request explaining the time requested and the basis for the leave of absence. Upon final consultation with the appropriate Dean or Vice President of Graduate Programs regarding the circumstances, a decision will be rendered. All applications for leave of absence are considered on their individual merits and approved only for extraordinary reasons.68Final approval of leaves of absences is given by the Dean in the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine and Pharmacy programs and the Vice President of Graduate Programs for all graduate programs. When an approved leave or formal withdrawal is granted before the midpoint of a course, the course(s) in progress at that time will be recorded on the transcriptwith the grade W; if an approved leave is granted after the midpoint of a course,the grade recorded on the transcript will reflect the grade status at that part of the term (WP if passing; WF if failing). Students who permanently withdraw from the academic program of the College without following the withdrawalprocedure will receive the grade F for courses in progress. In the case of courses repeated in their entirety, the new grade earned will be recorded in the term the repeated course is completed. This new grade will be calculated in the grade point average replacing the failure; however, this will not remove the previous W, WP or F for that course from the transcript. There are circumstances wherein the leave of absence is initiated by PCOM. These are financial leave of absence and academic leave of absence. A financial leave of absence is initiated by the Bursar's Office when a student does not meet his/her financial obligations to PCOM in a term. The Bursar's Office willadvise the Registrar's Office to remove the student from subsequent term enrollments. The student is notified by the Registrar's Office when this action has occurred. The student will not be permitted to return until his/her financialobligations are met. If a financial leave is implemented, the student still must adhere to completion of his/her program in the timeframe designated. An academic leave of absence is initiated by the Registrar's Office in one of twoways: 1. Student has been advised of dismissal and is granted the privilege of returning the following year. 2. In certain graduate programs there may be situations wherein a student is unable to register due to the fact that there are no courses offered in that term for which to register, but the student is still actively pursuing the degree. In this rare situation, the Registrar can approve a one term only leave. Implications of a Leave of Absence A student on leave of absence is not considered enrolled during the term of the leave and does not qualify for loan deferment, special monetary loans, grants or other special considerations that presuppose the status of a regular student. Therefore, students are advised to consult with the Financial Aid Office regarding their loan payback and other financial matters throughout their decision process. Health insurance may be continued if premiums are paid on time. Special arrangements must be made with Financial Operations for regular payment of premiums, which is generally monthly during a leave.69Return from Leave Before the conclusion of the leave of absence, the student must notify the Provostand the Registrar in writing of his or her intent to register and resume his or her degree program. If a leave of absence is due to personal illness, the student's attending physician or other health care provider as specified by the Provost mustsupply a letter attesting to the student's ability to continue in the academic or clinical program, or other training activity. The student's course of study will then beresumed at the point in the curriculum deemed most appropriate by the Provost. Prior to the return, all financial obligations must be satisfied with the Bursar as stipulated in the Tuition and Fees section of this catalog before petitioning for re-admission. Notwithstanding time off for leave(s), all requirements for graduation from PCOM must be completed within seven years from the first date of matriculation in the medical and doctoral programs, or within three years for the master's programs.A student on a leave of absence who fails to return within the time period specified in the approved leave of absence will be dropped as a student from theCollege. Any student who is dropped must reapply for admission. Transferring from PCOM If a student in the DO program or in any other degree program desires to transfer to any other institution, the initial contact should be made with the program director or the Dean in order to obtain a letter of good standing, if required. Transcripts may be requested from the Registrar and will be released only if the financial account is in good order. College Disciplinary Policy and Procedure It is not possible to enumerate all forms of behavior both within and outside the College premises and property that would raise serious questions concerning an individual student's continuing in study at the College and/or in such student's ability to practice as a professional after graduation, and which would constitute a violation of professional behavior. The following, however, are some examples of behavior that would be unacceptable: violation of any law of the land; dishonesty, such as cheating, or knowingly furnishing false information to the College; breaches of confidentiality in the course of patient care; drug or alcohol abuse; forgery, alteration or misuse of College or training site documents, records or identification; abuse, malicious misuse, damage or destruction of College or training site property; assault or battery, threat of force or violence or any other action or omission that would jeopardize the health or welfare of any member of the College or personnel at a training site, including, without limitation, members of the faculty, administrative or professional staff, students, employees, patients or visitors; abusive or disrespectful conduct toward members of the faculty, administration or professional staff, employees, students, patients or visitors to PCOM; theft of or damage to any property temporarily or permanently located on the College or training premises; obstruction or disruption ofteaching, research, patient care or any other College or training activities; unauthorized entry into, occupation of or obstruction of any building or part thereof on the College premises; violation of any other duly established rules andregulations of the College, affiliated hospitals or any affiliated institution. As used in the above examples, the College premises and College property shall includethe premises and property of any affiliated institutions or training sites where PCOM students pursue activities for academic credit. Also included is conductrelated to participation in any activities under the auspices of the College or its student organizations. Forms of Discipline Breaches of appropriate professional behavior and violations of College policy will be subject to discipline. Discipline includes, but is not limited to, warning, probation, suspension and dismissal. Warning: A warning is written admonition to a student for inappropriate behavior that is found to have constituted a relatively minor offense. It may beissued by an administrator or by any member of the faculty of the College.Warnings are reported to the Provost, Dean and the Assistant Dean for Student Affairs for informational purposes. Probation: A student may be placed on disciplinary probation for not longer than one academic year. The provisions of this probation will be decided by the Committee on Professional Conduct. Such provisions may include a requirement that the student obtain medical and/or psychiatric consultation and treatment or other terms designed to remedy the behavior being reviewed and to prevent its recurrence.Suspension: Suspension represents temporary separation from the College. The duration of a suspension shall be determined by the Faculty Committee on Discipline, but shall not exceed one academic year. The Committee may also place conditions on the student's return to the College. Such conditions may include the student's need to obtain medical and/or psychiatric consultation and treatment, or other appropriate conditions. Dismissal : Dismissal represents permanent separation from the College. Dismissal may be invoked by the Student Professional Conduct Committee and may be imposed with or without the right to reapply for admission to the College at a later date. Where medical or psychiatric consultation and treatment are recommended or required, the confidentiality of the physician/patient relationship shall be preserved and no report shall be made by the consulting physician to the Student Professional Conduct Committee without the consent of the affected student. However, the Committee on Professional Conduct may condition a student's ability to continue as a PCOM student upon a satisfactory evaluation by a physician, psychiatrist or psychologist appointed by the committee. The process and proceedings are described in the General Student Handbook. 70TUITION AND FEES The Board of Trustees established the following tuition for the 2015-2016 academic year.

Any other exceptions to this policy must be discussed with the Director of Financial Operations. 7374FINANCIAL AID The Office of Financial Aid strives to assist students with financial aid options and promote financial literacy while maintaining compliance with all federal,state and institutional policies. Determining Financial Need With the exception of Federal Stafford unsubsidized loans and Federal Graduate PLUS loans, federal financial aid is awarded on the basis of financial need. Whenthe student's Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is processed, a formula is applied to the information that the student provided to calculate the student's Expected Family Contribution (EFC). EFC is the amount that the federal government has determined that the student can contribute towards the cost of his/her education. The formula is established by law and is used tomeasure the student's financial strength based on his/her income and assets. The student's EFC is used in the following equation to determine the student's financial need: Financial Need = Cost of Attendance - Expected Family ContributionCost of Attendance A student's Cost of Attendance, or financial aid budget, is the sum of the following: - Tuition - Comprehensive School Fee- Class dues (not applicable to all programs)- Books and supplies - Instruments and equipment (not applicable to all programs) - Medical exam costs (not applicable to all programs) - Health insurance - Room/rent - Utilities - Food/groceries - Transportation - Personal - Loan fees THE APPLICATION PROCESS FAFSA To apply for financial assistance at PCOM for each academic year, students must first complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) at www.fafsa.ed.gov. This online form is the backbone of the financial aid process and is needed to be awarded federal student loans, federal work study, and certain PCOM and external scholarships.Eligibility In order to be considered for the majority of PCOM's financial aid resources andfederal student loans, the student must complete the FAFSA. The basic eligibilitycriteria for completing the FAFSA are: 1. The student must be a U.S. citizen or eligible noncitizen. 2. The student must be enrolled or accepted for enrollment as a regular student in an eligible degree or certificate program. 3. The student must be enrolled as at least a half-time student (usually at least 3 credits) each term. 4. The student must maintain satisfactory academic progress.

National Health Service Corps This is a competitive federal program that awards service-obligated scholarships to students pursuing primary health care training. The scholarship provides payment of tuition, fees, other reasonable costs and a monthly stipend. In return, for each year or partial year of scholarship support, the student must serve one year in a health professional shortage area. The minimum service commitment is two years. Health Professions Scholarship Program The United States Army, Navy and Air Force offer prospective military physicians, physician assistants, clinical psychologists and pharmacists a paid medical education in exchange for service as a commissioned medical department officer.

In return for the scholarship, recipients are 80obligated to give one year of service for each year of support (minimum two years of service). Recipients will be required to spend 45 days on active duty each year while in school (usually on weekends). Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) for Financial Aid The United States Department of Education requires every postsecondary institution receiving Title IV federal funds to have an academic progress policy that is used to determine eligibility for and continued receipt of federal funds. Although this policy must apply to all students whether or not they are receiving financial aid, the receipt of financial aid is a privilege that creates both rights and obligations for the student. The Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) policy has three components: 1. The student must maintain a certain grade point average or a comparative qualitative measurement against a norm. 2. The student must complete a certain percentage of all coursework attempted. 3. The student has a maximum timeframe to complete the program. Title IV federal funds affected by this policy at PCOM include Federal Work Study program, Federal Perkins Loans, Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loans and Federal Direct Stafford Loans. Although not required, all institutional funds are also governed by the SAP policy. A review of SAP will be conducted at the end of every Spring term regardless of when a student enrolls. Failure to meet any component of SAP at the end of the Spring term will result in the loss of eligibility for federal and PCOM financial aid for the next academic year. The Financial Aid Office will notify the student if the student has failed to meet the SAP standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress for Financial Aid and has lost eligibility for financial aid. If financial aid has already been awarded for the subsequent academic year, the offer of aid will be rescinded. A student may appeal the loss of eligibility of financial aid and seek to be placed on Financial Aid Academic Progress Probation for one term. This appeal must be based upon on either the death of a relative, a serious personal illness/injury or other extenuating circumstance. The student must be able to demonstrate that the illness/injury or extenuating circumstance had a direct impact on the student's academic performance. To do this, the student must work with the appropriate Academic Program advisor and/or Student Progress Evaluation Committee to develop an appropriate Academic Action Plan. If the student is granted Financial Aid Academic Progress Probation, the student will regain eligibility for financial aid for one term. At the end of the term, the student's academic record will be reviewed. If the student is now meeting the terms of the Standards of Academic Progress, the student will regain eligibility for financial aid for subsequent terms. If the student has still not met the terms of the Standards of Academic Progress but has fulfilled the terms of the Financial 81Aid Academic Progress Probation, then the student's Financial Aid Academic Progress Probation will be renewed for an additional term and the student will be awarded aid for that term. If the student has not fulfilled the terms of theFinancial Aid Academic Progress Probation, then the student will lose eligibility for financial aid. Students who are dismissed or withdrawn from the school are not deemed to be making SAP and are not eligible to receive financial aid. The policy on SAP will be disseminated to all newly matriculated students. All students will be notifiedyearly of the SAP policy, which will be published yearly in the Financial AidHandbook. Doctoral students must achieve a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0. Graduate students must achieve a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0.Graduate Certificate students must achieve a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0.Pharmacy students must achieve a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0. Doctor of Osteopathic students must: - Achieve a passing grade on all coursework, validations, exams and clinical clerkships. - Pass COMLEX I by the end of year 3. - Pass COMLEX II (both parts) by the end of year 4. Students must complete the appropriate percentage of all courses attempted to maintain a good academic standing. The completion percentage is calculated by dividing total hours earned by total hours attempted. If a student changes degree programs, then the SAP status will be based on the academic record of the new program. It is also important to understand how specific grades and/or course types count toward the completion ratio. The following grades count as attempted but not completed courses: - Incomplete - No Grade Reported - Withdraw - Failure - Unsatisfactory All students at PCOM are required to maintain a 67% completion of coursework. Transfer credits will count towards a student's attempted and completed credit hours. Students in the Doctor of Osteopathic and Psychology programs have seven years to complete the program from initial matriculation. Pharmacy students have six 8283years from initial matriculation, and graduate students have five years from initial matriculation to complete the program. Any term in which a student is enrolled counts towards the maximum timeframe regardless of whether or not the studentreceives federal financial aid. Refund Policy When a student's loan or scholarship funding is received by the PCOM Bursar's Office, any balance due to PCOM will be deducted from the amount of the funds. Any financial aid funding left over after paying the student's balance will then go to the student as a \"refund check\" via postal mail. All refunds are issued by the PCOM Bursar's Office. Direct Deposit Direct deposits of student refund checks are available by the student's completing an authorization form at the PCOM Bursar's Office. After refund money isprocessed by the PCOM Bursar's Office, it usually takes 1-5 business days for a student's bank to process the refund money and place it in the student's bank account. Pending Loan Advance (PLA) Requests A student is eligible for a PLA up to 15 days prior to the disbursement of the student's financial aid for the upcoming term or the start date of his or her first course in a term provided he or she has a term enrollment status of at least half time. The student needs to have completed all requirements to accept the financial aid. All counselors can complete the PLA form with a student, but finalapproval is required by an Associate Director or Director of Financial Aid. The amount of eligibility will be based on the student submitting the Pending Loan Advance Form. The counselor will speak with the student in person or over the phone to inform the student about any possible future deficit of funds for the upcoming quarter and, if necessary, recommend that the student make spending adjustments to eliminate the deficit. The student will be asked why he or she needs a PLA on the Pending Loan Advance Form. If the stated reason is an expense that could not otherwise be included in the student's cost of attendance or approvable as a budget appeal, the counselor will deny the request. The maximum amount available for a loan advance to a particular student will be limited to the lesser of the following: - $2,000 for both graduate and professional students. - Amount requested. - Amount approved by counselor after a review of budget and aid for upcoming term. The student is limited to one PLA per academic year. If a student has anemergency situation that is unavoidable, the student can meet with the Director to discuss a possible second PLA for the academic year. If approved, the Director will make it very clear that no additional PLA will be approved for the remaining academic school year. Tuition Refund Policy If a student withdraws from classes within seven weeks from the start of the term, a pro-rata refund or tuition credit may be authorized. In the case of fullwithdrawals, the effective date of withdrawal is the date on which the studentfiled with the dean a written notification of withdrawal or a request for a leave of absence. For courses not conducted on a weekly schedule, summer sessions, and for clinical clerkships/preceptorships in the medical and physician assistant programs, the refund is prorated according to the percent of the clerkship,preceptorship or course completed as indicated in parentheses below: Withdrawal Date Term Charge % of Credit During first week of class (up to 5% of instructional time) 0% term charge 100% credit During second week of class (more than 5% but no more than 10% of instructional time) 10% term charge 90% credit During third and fourth weeks of class (more than 10% but no more than 25% of instructional time) 25% term charge 75% credit During fifth through seventh weeks of class (more than 25% but no more than 50% of instructional time) 50% term charge 50% credit Withdrawal after seventh week of class (more than 50% of instructional time) 100% term charge 0% credit No fee or portion of a fee is refundable. The refund policy is subject to change at the discretion of the Board of Trustees, but in no instance will such a change become retroactive. All federal financial aid funds are credited or returned in compliance with the Federal Return Policy Schedule. A student's total Cost of Attendance is based on certain enrollment. When a student drops courses, the PCOM Financial Aid Office will likely reduce the student's total Cost of Attendance. Often this results in no additional allocation of refund money to the student. For additional information contact the PCOM Bursar's Office. 84Return of Title IV Funds When Withdrawing From All Courses The PCOM Financial Aid Office is responsible for recalculating federal financialaid eligibility for students who discontinue enrollment during the term. Upon notification from the PCOM Registrar's Office that a student has withdrawn from or dropped all classes, was dismissed, or is approved for a leave of absence, the PCOM Financial Aid Office is required to calculate the percentage of the term completed if the student received or was eligible for Title IV federal student aid (Stafford, PLUS, and Perkins loans). If the withdrawal date indicates that the student left the institution prior to completing at least 60% of the enrollment period, the PCOM Financial Aid Office must recalculate the eligibility for Title IV funds based on the following formularequired by the federal government: 1. The percentage of payment period is the number of days completed to the withdrawal date. 2. The percentage of earned aid is the percentage of the payment period completed, divided by the total number of days in the payment period or term. Breaks of five or more days are not counted as days that are part of the term. Funds paid by federal student aid programs are returned to the appropriateprogram based on the percentage of unearned aid as required by the federal government: The aid to be returned is the result of the total amount of aid that could be disbursed minus the percentage of aid earned, multiplied by the total amount of aid that could have been disbursed for the payment period or term. If a student earned less aid than the amount disbursed, the institution is required to return the unearned portion of funds to the federal program(s). As a result, the student may owe a debit balance to the institution. The institution must return the amount of Title IV funds for which it is responsible within thirty days of the date of the determination of the student's withdrawal date. Funds are repaid in the following order in accordance with federal regulation: 1. Federal Direct Stafford Unsubsidized Loans 2. Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loans 3. Federal Perkins Loans If a student earned more aid than was disbursed to the student account, the institution would request a post-withdrawal disbursement, which must be paid within 120 days of the student's withdrawal. 85EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES AND RESOURCES PCOM maintains its main campus in Philadelphia and a branch campus in the Atlanta, Georgia area.

It recognizes that the neuromusculoskeletal system is ofmajor importance to human life. The interrelationship between this and otherbody-systems is a basic part of osteopathic philosophy. An emphasis on primary care, health maintenance, prevention of disease and attention to the neuromusculoskeletal system is key to osteopathic medical education and practice. Universally accepted today, these attributes were considered unorthodox when Dr. Andrew Taylor Still (1828-1917) objected to the crude medications of his time and sought to enhance the body's inherent healing through manipulation. The osteopathic physician incorporates evaluation and treatment of the musculoskeletal system as a basis for an approach to health and disease, combining it with the diagnostic and therapeutic modalities used by general scientific approaches to the healing arts. Like their MD counterparts, DOs must be licensed in the states where they practice, and additional board certificationin specialties further underscores their professional credentials. All 50 states and the District of Columbia provide for the unlimited practice of medicine and surgery by osteopathic physicians. Licensing boards are usually composed of senior members of the osteopathic profession. In some states, MDs and DOs participate in combined licensing boards. Osteopathic Philosophy The basic premises accepted by this profession provide the osteopathic physician with a unique way of looking at health and disease. These premises include the following: 1. The human body is a unit in which structure and function are reciprocally interdependent. 2. The body, through a complex system, tends to be self-regulating and self- healing. 3. The adequate function of body-systems depends on the unimpeded flow of blood and nerve impulses. 4. The musculoskeletal system is a major body-system and its importance exceeds that of mere framework and support. 5. There are musculoskeletal components to disease that are not only manifestations of the disease, but also important contributing and maintaining factors. The adoption of these basic premises led to the development of the osteopathic total-body concept. The patient is considered ecologically rather than as an isolated unit. Instead of emphasizing the momentary disease state, the 99osteopathic approach studies and treats the person's well-being, lifestyle and behavior as a whole. Through the American Osteopathic Association (AOA), the profession maintains its independence and its own medical schools while cooperating with other branches of medical science. Primary care is emphasized in the educational programs, and a majority of graduates enter primary care fields. However, DOsparticipate in all specialty and subspecialty areas of current medical practice. Educational GoalsA fundamental educational goal of the College is to prepare students forexcellence in the practice of osteopathic medicine. The course of medical studyis a practitioner's program with a strong emphasis on primary care, prevention and osteopathic concepts. Each osteopathic medical student progresses through a uniform and comprehensive curriculum designed to achieve this goal. Elective clinical clerkships expose students to specialty or subspecialty fields during training, and later they may specialize. At PCOM, students are trained first as family practitioners and thus build solid foundations for their careers. Throughout the curriculum, osteopathic concepts and methods are stressed. Efficiency is also an educational goal, maximizing each student's learning by utilizing the most effective educational methodologies available. Innovations such as computerized tutorials, classroom videos and simulated patientencounters will sharpen skills as a physician. The curriculum bridgesdepartmental divisions and joins related disciplines, such as basic sciences to surgery and internal medicine, so that students relate different perspectives to a variety of conditions taught in a common time frame. Instruction is attuned to the changing demands in American health care. A majority of PCOM's graduates enter primary care practice, where the large majority of health problems are treated today. The general objectives of the educational program are expressed as \"core competencies,\" the domains of knowledge and skills in which all students must demonstrate competency to earn the degree, Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine: 1. Osteopathic principles and practice, which are established and incorporated in the development of skills. 2. Patient care that is compassionate, appropriate and effective for the treatment of health problems and the promotion of health. 3. Medical knowledge about established and evolving biomedical, clinical and cognate (e.g., epidemiological and social-behavioral) sciences and the application of this knowledge to patient care. 1004. Practice-based learning and improvement that involves investigation and self- evaluation of patient care, appraisal and assimilation of scientific evidence, and improvements in patient care. 5. Interpersonal and communications skills that result in effective information exchange and teaming with patients, their families and other healthprofessionals. 6. Professionalism, as manifested through a commitment to carrying out professional responsibilities, adherence to ethical principles, and sensitivity to a diverse patient population. 7. Systems-based practice, as manifested by actions that demonstrate an awareness of the larger context and system of health care and the ability to effectively call on system resources to provide optimal care. 8. Information literacy, as manifested by the capability to access, understand and apply biomedical information, and actions that demonstrate the skills necessary to utilize information technology tools to effectively accessinformation from various resources and formats. The Basic Sciences and Preclinical YearsPCOM students begin preparation for the world of clinical medicine from their first day as medical students. The curriculum combines basic science and clinical course content with integrated courses such as Cellular and Molecular Basis of Medicine, as well as integrated approaches to the pharmacology, pathology, medicine and surgery related to respiratory, genitourinary, cardiovascular,reproductive, endocrine, nervous and gastrointestinal systems. The first two years lay the foundation with intense concentration on the basic sciences, anatomy, biochemistry, molecular biology, neuroscience, physiology, microbiology, pathology and pharmacology, taught in integrated course units that emphasize clinical applications. PCOM also recognizes that medical practice is more than science. Coursework in ethics and patient communication helps the student relate well to patients, while content in evidence-based medicine and public health prepares the student for the complex world of private practice. The basic sciences are complemented by instruction in clinical subjects such as internal medicine, surgery, neurology, psychiatry, pediatrics, epidemiology, OB/GYN, family medicine, rehabilitation medicine, geriatrics, radiology, oncology and physical diagnosis. The principles and practice of osteopathic medicine are taught throughout the medical curriculum. All students attend small-group sessions during the first and second year to develop communication and diagnostic skills. These special instructional activities include patient observation, case conferences and basic clinical skills workshops. In addition, an active standardized patient and robotic simulation program introduces students to patient care through examinations of patient actors in a simulated practice setting, augmented by clinical exercises on high-tech human patient simulator manikins. 101102The last two years emphasize clinical training experiences. Philadelphia Campus students are assigned to clinical clerkships throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and neighboring states. This unique training network comprisesaffiliated hospitals, five Healthcare Centers, numerous outpatient units and scores of physicians' offices. These clinical settings become teaching arms of the College; in effect, the Commonwealth is our campus. Students at the Georgia Campus are assigned to clinical clerkships throughout Georgia and the Southeast. The program is designed to afford progressive student responsibility for all phases of patient care under the direction of experienced physicians. Thisincludes history taking, physical examinations, daily patient rounds, lectures, conferences and case presentations. Students rotate through services in medicine, family practice, manipulative medicine, surgery, cardiology, OB/GYN, pediatrics, psychiatry, otorhinolaryngology and office-based preceptorships. On electiveclerkships, students may choose to pursue special interests at other medical institutions anywhere across the nation. All students receive additional trainingin osteopathic manipulative medicine during the third year. One objective of the College is to encourage graduates to practice incommunities where health care services are most needed. Therefore, each student entering PCOM must be willing to accept clinical education assignments throughout the region. Each senior student serves at least eight weeks in an underserved community clerkship. An alternative rural elective is offered to a limited number of students, whereby the student may select an area of alternative health care delivery or a rural area of high medical need. Requirements for GraduationEach candidate for the degree of Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) must be age 2l or older, be of good moral character and have passed Parts I and II of the COMLEX (National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners), including the Level II Physical Examination component. Each candidate must have completed satisfactorily the program of study PCOM requires for the degree within seven years from the date of initial matriculation. Attendance at the Commencement ceremonies conferring the degree is required of each candidate. Requirements for PracticeEach recipient of the DO degree must fulfill the requirements of the state licensing board of the state in which the physician chooses to practice. These requirements are regulated by the laws of each state. Pre-Doctoral Research Opportunities exist for extracurricular research experience for all of PCOM's students. Research laboratories and equipment, as well as electron microscopic, computer and animal facilities, are available for this purpose. Students have the103opportunity to work with faculty members on a variety of biomedical topics. Most research is performed between the first and second academic years. Students may be partially funded for their research efforts, based on eligibility, through CollegeWork-Study or external granting agencies. A compilation of faculty research projects/interests may be obtained from the Chief Science Officer. Dual Degree Programs DO/PhD in Cellular and Molecular Biology (Philadelphia Campus) The Joint DO/PhD Program is a collaborative initiative between the PhiladelphiaCollege of Osteopathic Medicine and the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia (USci). The purpose of the program is to provide a joint degree offering for students who wish to pursue physician-scientist careers, and the program is designed for students with specialized career plans. The research-intensive program provides three full years of research fellowship training in addition to the four year osteopathic medical program. The three year research component culminates ina research project and dissertation defense. A stipend and support for supplies/equipment are awarded in the research years. The DO/PhD Program is designed to train physician-scientists who will contribute to the fund of knowledge by conducting original, high-quality scientific research with the perspective of a clinical practitioner. The program represents a critical link between bench and bedside by combining medical training with research training and will produce clinical scholar-practitioners who can make ongoing contributions to the osteopathic clinical, scientific and academic community. Students are accepted into the program as part of their original application to osteopathic medical school through a special admissions process; hence acceptance to the DO and PhD components occurs simultaneously, with USci approving the acceptance into the PhD program. Non-acceptance to the joint DO/PhD Program does not preclude a student from being accepted to the DO program only, through the normal PCOM admissions process. PCOM awards the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree after successful completion of the DO Program. USci awards the Doctor of Philosophy degree upon successful completion of all requirements for the PhD in Cell and Molecular Biology, including dissertation defense and submission of a final manuscript for publication. For information regarding admission: http://www.pcom.edu/Admissions/admissions.html DO/MBA Program (Philadelphia Campus) In conjunction with Saint Joseph's University, a master of business administration degree in health and medical services may be earned by DO program students104who concurrently complete a five year course of study for the DO and MBA degrees. Created in 1989 as the nation's first DO/MBA degree, the curriculumrequires approximately 39-45 hours of MBA coursework during two summersessions and four semesters of evening classes in the joint program. This program responds to the increasing need for business acumen in medical practice. It also prepares physicians for a wide range of emerging careers in medical administration. Students who are interested in business administration but do not wish to enroll in the full MBA program may complete a 5-course Graduate Business Certificate during the second year of medical school. The Saint Joseph's University MBA isaccredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). DO/MPH Program (Philadelphia Campus) Students who have successfully completed their first year of study at PCOM may enter a special joint degree program in affiliation with Temple University, leadingto a master of public health degree.

The master of public health degree also prepares students foreventual specialty training and certification in occupational or environmental medicine. The Temple MPH program is accredited by the Council for Educationin Public Health (CEPH). Students may also choose to enroll in a DO/MPH program in affiliation with Jefferson School of Population Health, which provides a 36-credit program that includes core public health disciplines in behavioral and social sciences, biostatistics, epidemiology, environmental health services and health policy. The Jefferson DO/MPH program is completed during a one-year leave from medical study, following the third medical year. Upon return to the clinical clerkships (fourth year medical curriculum) DO/MPH students combine senior clinical training with the completion of the MPH program through an elective public health clerkship in a PCOM clinical service, followed by completion of the Jefferson MPH capstone project. DO/MS/PhD in Health Policy Program (Philadelphia Campus) Conducted in association with the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia, the DO/MS/PhD program in health policy studies allows PCOM students to augment their medical education with health policy studies leading to the master of science, with an option to progress to a research-based doctoral program. The program prepares students for positions of local or national leadership in health policy making and analysis through the study of research methods, epidemiology, economics, technology, statistics, law and public health policy. Graduates are trained to research and analyze issues affecting health care delivery and health status in a range of professional settings. The DO/MS/PhD program isa dual-degree track open to qualified first year DO students. Students interested in a non-research health policy program may opt for the MPH in health policy. On-Campus Dual-Degree Programs and Undergraduate Medical Fellowships Undergraduate Fellowship in Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine (Philadelphia and Georgia Campuses) The undergraduate OMM Fellowship seeks to assist in the development of the student into a highly skilled clinician in all aspects of osteopathic medicine. Students may enter the undergraduate fellowship after their second year of study. The fellowship extends the clinical clerkship curriculum to three years. At least 12 months of clinical training is provided in the Department of Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine in this special program. Fellows have special academic, clinical and research responsibilities beyond those of other students. Fellowsreceive remission of tuition, a monthly stipend and travel allowance.

The mission of the GA-PCOM PharmD program is to educate caring, proactive generalist pharmacists according to a practice model in which the practitioner assumes responsibility for a patient's medication- related needs and is held accountable for this commitment. The program also responds to the need for pharmacists in the nation, the state of Georgia and the southeastern region. The program educates pharmacists who prepare and provide drug products and assume responsibility for the rational use of drugs by contributing to the design, implementation, monitoring and modification of therapeutic plans that will achieve defined goals and improve therapeutic outcomes. Educational Goals The GA-PCOM School of Pharmacy prepares generalist, entry-level pharmacists who are able to deliver high-quality pharmaceutical care. To achieve this mission, students must develop the knowledge, skills and attitudes that enable them to competently: (a) provide population-based and patient-specific pharmaceutical care, (b) manage and use resources of the health care system and (c) promote health improvement, wellness, and disease prevention. While preparing pharmacy practitioners is the primary mission of the Doctor of Pharmacy program, the program also provides an avenue by which students may explore a broad range of career opportunities. The program therefore aspires to foster interest in the creation of new knowledge to enhance patient health outcomes and quality of life and also to prepare students for further education. CurriculumThe program is configured in a curricular format in which students complete: 1. the pre-professional phase (three or four years) of general education, biomedical and sciences instruction at undergraduate colleges 2. the last four professional years of pharmaceutical sciences and pharmacy practice instruction at the GA-PCOM facility, as well as clinical experiences at clinical sites throughout Georgia and the southeast. Each term is a 13 week period, corresponding to the calendar used by PCOM academic programs in both Philadelphia and Georgia. The extension of coursework over the three terms of each academic year provides the opportunity for the across-the-curriculum development of skills. The curriculum is composed of courses in biomedical, pharmaceutical, social/behavioral/administrative, and clinical sciences. A number of electivecourses are available to allow students to enhance their knowledge of pharmacy- related topics in specific areas. There are five Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experiences (IPPE) in which students are given exposure to pharmacy practice in a variety of different specialty areas and begin their hands-on experiences. Thefinal year of the program consists of the Advanced Pharmacy PracticeExperiences (APPE) in which students are required to complete eight different rotations. These rotations consist of five weeks in a particular pharmacy practice site. Required rotations are: - General Medicine- Ambulatory Care- Hospital Practice- Community Practice- Community Management Elective rotations will include rotations such as (but not limited to): - Cardiology- Infectious Diseases- Pediatrics- Compounding Pharmacy- Pharmaceutical Industry Management A comprehensive examination will be given at the end of the second and third professional years. These examinations assess knowledge and skills acquired during the curriculum. Students that do not pass the comprehensive exam willbe allowed to take a remediation exam. Failure to pass the remediation examination will prevent a student from progressing to the next professional year and may result in dismissal from the program. This curriculum, including active learning skills development time, is designed to develop the knowledge, professional skills, professional attitudes and values that are required for an entry-level pharmacist. Requirements for GraduationEach candidate for the degree of Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) must be of good moral character and have completed satisfactorily all academic requirements in the program of study. All requirements for the degree must be completed within six years from the date of initial matriculation. PharmD graduates must demonstrate that they have acquired competency in six basic areas of knowledge, skills, abilities, behaviors and attitudes: pharmacy knowledge and practice skills, patient care skills, communication/interpersonal skills, professionalism, understanding and skills in the use of information and empirical evidence, and skills in systems-based practice. LicensureIn general, in order for candidates to take the pharmacist licensure examination, 114state boards of pharmacy will require successful completion of the requirements for the Doctor of Pharmacy degree from an accredited institution and completion of a certain number of hours as a pharmacy intern. In Georgia, applicants forpharmacist licensure must be at least 18 years of age, have graduated from an ACPE-accredited school/college of pharmacy and completed 1,500 hours ofinternship under the supervision of a registered pharmacist. Schools of pharmacy in Georgia allow students to claim credit for 1,000 internship hours obtainedduring experiential rotations, and the student is required to obtain 500 additional hours on his or her own as a licensed pharmacy intern. An applicant may register with the Georgia Board of Pharmacy as a pharmacy intern if he orshe is registered in an accredited school/college of pharmacy. All students at the PCOM School of Pharmacy - Georgia Campus are required toobtain their Georgia intern license during the first semester, and the School willassist with the application process.

The purpose of the Alumni Association is to act as a liaison between the College and its more than 13,000 living DO alumni and over 2,500 graduate program alumni who practice throughout the United States, in five foreign countries and in every branch of the military service. In addition, the Association promotes PCOM to prospective students and provides financial support forexcellence in osteopathic and health care education. Contributions to the Alumni Association support the increasingly critical programs and services underwritten by the Association. In addition, the Association makes special gifts to support College priorities, including a gift of$100,000 in 2012, a gift of $100,000 in 2013 to support the renovation of the Clinical Learning and Assessment Centers on both the Philadelphia and GeorgiaCampuses, and a $50,000 scholarship gift to honor PCOM President and Chief Executive Officer Matthew Schure, PhD, upon his retirement. Throughout the year, the Alumni Association sponsors programs that benefit its members and current students. An active interest is taken in student life. Upon request, information is provided on PCOM alumni to students pursuing electives, mentors and preceptorships across the country. The Alumni Association supports the annual PCOM Golf Classic and underwrites a large portion of the expenses associated with the annual ReunionWeekend and other events throughout the year. The Alumni Association is governed by a Board of Directors, composed of elected representatives from regional districts around the United States and representing all academic programs of the College. Meetings are held twice a year, in January and June. All alumni of Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine are members of the Alumni Association. Alumni Association programs and services are supported by alumni and the College. The Office of Alumni Relations and Development administers the Alumni Association and keeps alumni notified of key developments. The office maintains the alumni database and supports special events for alumni on campus and at national and regional conferences.
