A new approach to healing Healing Touch is a biofield (the magnetic field around the body) therapy in which practitioners consciously use their hands in a heart-centered and intentional way to support and facilitate physical, emotional, mental and spiritual health. Lovelace's Healing Touch certified practitioners are able to influence the human energy system, specifically the energy field that surrounds the body, and the energy centers that control the flow from the energy field to the physical body. Through the power of touch, non-invasive techniques are performed to restore balance and harmonies in the energy system, placing the person in a position to self-heal. \"Healing Touch promotes relaxation and a sense of wellbeing with the intention of facilitating balance and physical, emotional, mental and spiritual health,\" explained Deanna Flores, Medical Oncology Nurse Navigator, with the Lovelace Cancer Center. Benefits of Healing Touch Healing Touch is non-invasive and non-toxic, restoring balance and harmony to our natural biofield without the use of pharmaceuticals. Other benefits include: - Reduces pain - Reduces anxiety - Relieves stress and depression - Quicker recovery from surgery - Provides support during chemotherapy and radiation - Strengthens immune system - Reduces effects of trauma and chronic pain - Deepens spiritual connection Healing Touch is an integrative treatment for cancer, as well as for cardio-vascular disease, chronic pain and other medical conditions. \"Cancer affects all aspects of a person's life, not just physical health,\" said Flores. \"The holistic approach does more than just treat the disease; it supports and empowers the whole person through the challenging circumstance life has given them.\" Breast cancer survivor and Lovelace employee, Melinda Maxwell, has received Healing Touch for 2 \u00bd years and finds the form of therapy immensely beneficial. \"I have received Healing Touch Therapy during every stage of my cancer treatments,\" explained Maxwell. \"I can see how much it has really helped me focus on feeling whole, happy, and healthy- three feelings that are very difficult for cancer patients to come to terms with.\" The gentle therapeutic techniques foster a powerful nurse-patient connection, according to Maxwell. \"Having the Healing Touch practitioner create a restorative environment and clear my energy enhances everything my mind is working to do. Together we achieve a sense of peace with my situation. I believe this therapy is very powerful when combined with the other modalities in my treatment plan.\" \"I find this therapy very effective in helping me calm myself,\" shared Maxwell. \"I leave a session feeling peaceful and grounded. I find I am getting closer and closer to finding my whole, happy, healthy self these days.\" Healing Touch is available by appointment at the Breast Care Center at Lovelace Women's Hospital and Lovelace Cancer Center.
