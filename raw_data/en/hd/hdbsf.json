It is a branch of Medical Science being an established medical specialty in many European and other Universities worldwide. Its principles originate from Hippocrates the Greek, \"the father of Medicine\". But the foundation of Homeopathy as a therapeutic system began 250 years ago in Germany by Dr. Samuel Hahnemann professor of Medicine. Hahnemann was one of the first scientists employing systematically about 200 years ago the scientific method of Double Blind Trial in his research. He used it in order to prove the pharmacological actions of several vegetal and mineral substances on healthy subjects. The result of this scientific experimentation was the creation of an extensive Homeopathic Pharmacology (Materia Medica). What does Homeopathy cure? Any patient independently of illness or age can visit the homeopathic doctor. Homeopathic treatment, although highly effective is definitely not a \"panacea\". And this is also true for any therapeutic system. It does not claim to cure everything. It has its limitations depending on the progress of the disease and on the reversibility of the pathology. But even in long term or chronic and severe diseases, there is always the possibility of substantial relief, depending of course on the case. Homeopathy can also act preventively in healthy persons reducing their predispositions for illnesses, that is, their weak points. It strengthens the organism, raises the vitality, lessens the levels of anxiety and increases productivity of body and mind. Although results come quickly especially in acute or functional illnesses the aim of the homeopathic doctor is not just to relieve the patient temporarily from his symptoms. His main purpose is to cure permanently and in depth by dealing with the original causes of his disease. Homeopathy has very good therapeutic results in illnesses like: allergies, migraines, hormonal diseases, menstrual disorders, gastritis, colitis, anxious or phobic neurosis, depression, skin problems, eczema, psoriasis, recurrent vaginitis, recurrent infections of the urinary tract, recurrent colds, hypertension, bronchitis, asthma, hair falling, obesity, acne, tonsillitis, cholesteremia, thyroid diseases, back pain, dorsal syndrome, arthritis, etc. Therapeutic Advantages 1. Homeopathic medicines have no side effects or contraindications of any kind and the patient cannot be addicted to them. It can be given without any second thought even to babies, pregnant women, allergic patients or patients with renal or liver failure. 2. Homeopathic treatment, when successfully carried out has permanent results. It is not a mere relief of symptoms but it is a removal of the causes of disease, i.e. Chronic Predispositions. Homeopathic Medicines Homeopathic medicines are natural. The raw materials used for their preparation are simple minerals and pharmaceutical plants. But they are not just mere herbs or food supplements or vitamins. They are transformed into highly effective drugs after a series of scientific but natural preparations of the original raw material. This scientific process first adopted by Hahnemann was called Potentization. First, the vegetal or mineral raw material is diluted into distilled water or ethyl alcohol and then it is succussed at a certain way. Then follows a series of successive rounds of dilution and succussion. We, now know from certain contemporary experimentation, that succussion carried out at certain frequency and intensity can result to increased kinetic energy of the free hydrogen radicals that exist in the dilution of distilled water or ethyl alcohol. This kinetic energy is spent in the formation of polymeric hydrogen chains that act as a \"mould\" of the initially diluted substance. After the 23rd successive dilution and succussion (23rd potentization), at which point Avogadro's number (1,6 X 10 to the 23rd power) is surpassed, in the final dilution, from the chemical point of view, only pure water or pure ethyl alcohol is expected to be found. And this is true, chemically. Yet, the polymeric hydrogen chains alter the properties of the dilution from the point of physics, i.e. Viscosity and Dielectric Constant. In addition, the Spectrography of the final dilution is similar to that of the original diluted substance yet with smaller wave length, i.e. with greater energy. Despite the immense dilution of the original liquid the properties of the diluted substance are carried out to the final dilution-homeopathic drug. The process of Potentization (successive dilution and succussion) has transformed the original material drug into an energy drug. The latter acts on the same energy level that Acupuncture acts, i.e. on what Homeopathy calls \"Vital Force\". This energy homeopathic drug acts individually since it's similar to the energy disorder of a certain organism. In addition, by bringing the human energy level into an equilibrium it acts both on the physical and the psychological level. For all the above reasons, it lacks any kind of material side effects. Contemporary research on nano-molecules, the science of Cybernetics and the Theory of Water \"Memory\" have contributed the most in defining the action mechanism of the energy homeopathic drug. Homeopathic drugs are prescribed by medical doctors and can be bought from homeopathic pharmacies, that is, common pharmacies that have a homeopathic stock. They are produced by European Pharmaceutical Companies according to the European Pharmacopoeia. Diagnosis and Treatment The homeopathic doctor, just like his allopathic colleague, asks questions to take the case, performs clinical examinations, orders blood and other examinations where needed, so as to diagnose the diseases of his patient. From that point on the homeopathic doctor takes the case in a unique way so as to diagnose the constitution of his patient, that is, his special type of physical organism and his special type of psychology. Homeopathic case taking includes several questions asking details about his physical and psychological characteristics, his habits, his way of life, his views on every day matters, etc. This is absolutely necessary so as to prescribe the \"Simillimum\", that is, the remedy most similar to the patient's constitution at that certain phase of his life. This, similar to the patient, remedy, will activate the patient's therapeutic mechanisms, both physical and psychological and this will result to cure. When a patient is already treated with any kind of common medicines or treatments it is not necessary to stop it so as to start receiving homeopathic medicines. He can take both at the same time without any complications of any sort. In fact it would be wrong, from a medical point of view, to stop suddenly and abruptly any allopathic medicine long given and necessary for the patient. When the homeopathic treatment has progressed successfully, the patient feels better and does not need the allopathic symptomatic treatment and if examinations become normal, then and only then, the homeopathic doctor reduces the dosage or stops the allopathic drugs. This could be done in collaboration with the allopathic doctor that treats the patient in severe or special diseases or by the homeopathic doctor in most cases, since he is a medical doctor himself. Medical doctors, no matter what therapeutic system they practice, should collaborate with each other for the benefit of the patient. The benefit of the patient is, after all, or should be after all, the sole aim of doctors and Medicine. What Kind of Homeopathy? Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics and every Science worthy of being called Science, are strictly based on Laws and Scientific Methodology. Homeopathic Academy promotes Classical Miasmatic Constitutional Homeopathy which is based on Homeopathic Laws and the Scientific Methodology of Double Blind Trial (Provings). 1. Law of the Whole When it comes to homeopathic diagnosis, the homeopathic doctor examines all physical symptoms of the patient from all organic systems. In addition he asks about all psychological symptoms of the patient. Furthermore he notes down all the general characteristics of the patient at the state of Clinical Health (aversions and desires, habits, tendencies, personality traits, etc.) When it comes to treatment the homeopathic doctor aims simultaneously at the following: a. to cure the diseases of the patient b. to improve his general state c. to improve his psychological state d. to decrease his Chronic Predispositions e. to decrease the Constitutional Characteristics of the individual Therefore, prescribing homeopathic medicines by aiming at symptoms (Symptom-oriented \"Homeopathy\") or at diseases (Disease-oriented \"Homeopathy\") is definitely a wrong application of Homeopathy. There isn't one homeopathic drug specific for headache in general, the same for all patients with headache. On the contrary, there's only one similar homeopathic remedy for a specific patient with a certain kind of headache at a certain moment of his life. 2. Law of Individualization The homeopathic doctor prescribes each time that remedy which is similar to the psychosomatic picture of the patient taken as a whole. The remedy is similar to the each time prevalent constitution that affects the patient at a certain moment of his life. Therefore it's wrong to say: \"This is the homeopathic remedy for colitis, the same for all patients\". Every person, at any time of his life, is under the influence of many different constitutions, yet only one dominates and is mainly responsible for his disorder. Therefore it's wrong to say: \"This is your remedy and every time you get ill, no matter the kind of disease, this is what you will take\". 3. Law of Similarity The doctor must always prescribe that homeopathic remedy which is the most similar (simillimum) psychosomatically to the Acute or Chronic Illness of the specific patient. Therefore, there's only one simillimum for the patient at a certain moment of his life and it is a wrong practice to prescribe mixtures of homeopathic remedies (Complex \"Homeopathy\"). Such complex drugs aren't similar to the patient. They are but arbitrary mixtures disease-oriented with unknown and unpredictable counter-actions among their components. 4. Law of Hierarchy There's a certain hierarchy in the structure and function of the human being. Psychological level comes first and Physical Level comes second. Furthermore, when it comes to Physical Level the hierarchy is: Nervous System, Hormonal System, Heart and Lungs, Viscera, Muscles and Bones and finally Skin. Therefore, psychological symptoms and characteristics are more important for homeopathic diagnosis and prognosis than the physical ones. In proportion more important are those symptoms and characteristics that have to do with the individual and not with his diseases and his pathology. "}
