These can include fevers, infections, sugar imbalances, neurological issues and skin rashes. Regeneration and detoxification, on the other hand, mean the complete elimination of the cause of the symptoms. If you correct the cause of the problem, the symptoms will automatically go away. Regeneration means rebuilding tissue that is failing, and detoxification is the method used to remove the inflammation and toxins that have caused these tissues to fail in the first place. Always ask yourself what the cause of your symptoms may be, and focus on that. Regeneration has three main components to it; alkalise, detoxify and energise. All three work together and are inseparable. Alkalisation is vital to tissue regeneration because it is anti-inflammatory. It builds electrolytes for proper ionisation, oxidation and neutralisation. It allows for proper cellular respiration and for the distribution of nutrients throughout the body. Detoxifying cleans all the obstructions, irritants and stimulants, like mucus, heavy metals, chemicals and pesticides out of your body. This allows for proper digestion, absorption, utilisation and elimination. Energising your cells with energy from living foods is also vital to robust health. Without the power of live foods, which are full of nutrition and electricity, you cannot accomplish alkalisation and detoxification. Often after you begin a cleansing program, you may start to feel worse before you feel better. As your body prepares itself for regeneration, it liberates toxins and breaks down damaged cells which causes a release of poisonous compounds into your bloodstream. The good news is that your body will expel these toxins. The bad news is your energy may decrease and you can start to feel a bit under the weather. It is not uncommon to experience many side effects when you start cleansing your body. These can include cold and flu like symptoms, changes in bowel motions, fatigue, fevers, heartburn, joint pain, swelling, rashes, itching, lung congestion, headaches, emotional releases and more. "}
