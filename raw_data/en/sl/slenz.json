Vaccinations and malaria risk Review both the Vaccination and Malaria sections on this page to find out if you may need vaccines and/or a malaria risk assessment before you travel to this country. If you think you require vaccines and/or malaria risk assessment, you should make an appointment with a travel health professional: A travel health risk assessment is also advisable for some people, even when vaccines or malaria tablets are not required. Risk prevention advice Many of the health risks experienced by travellers cannot be prevented by vaccines and other measures need to be taken. Always make sure you understand the wider risks at your destination and take precautions, including: Our advice section gives detailed information on minimising specific health risks abroad: Other health considerations Make sure you have [travel insurance](/advice/general-travel-health-advice/travel-insurance) before travel to cover healthcare abroad. Find out if there are any restrictions you need to consider if you are [travelling with medicines](/advice/general-travel-health-advice/travelling-with-medicines). Know how to access healthcare at your destination: see the [GOV.UK English speaking doctors and medical facilities: worldwide list](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/doctors-and-medical-facilities-worldwide-list) If you feel unwell on your return home from travelling abroad, always seek advice from a healthcare professional and let them know your travel history. Vaccinations - Confirm primary courses and boosters are up to date as recommended for life in Britain - including for example, [seasonal flu vaccine](https://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk/advice/disease-prevention-advice/flu-influenza)(if indicated), [MMR](http://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk/advice/disease-prevention-advice/measles), vaccines required for occupational risk of exposure, lifestyle risks and underlying medical conditions. - Courses or boosters usually advised: Diphtheria; Hepatitis A; Tetanus; Typhoid. - Other vaccines to consider: Hepatitis B; Rabies. - Selectively advised vaccines - only for those individuals at highest risk: Cholera; Japanese Encephalitis. - Yellow fever vaccination certificate requirements for India are specific and quite lengthy, to read the full details via the [W.H.O Website](http://www.who.int/ith/en/) Please Note: If you travel to India from the UK, transiting through Europe or the Middle East (and you have not been in a South American or African country in the previous week) a yellow fever vaccination certificate is not required. Notes on the diseases mentioned above - [Cholera](/advice/disease-prevention-advice/cholera): spread through consumption of contaminated water and food. It would be unusual for travellers to contract cholera if they take basic precautions with food and water and maintain a good standard of hygiene. Risk is higher during floods and after natural disasters, in areas with very poor sanitation and lack of clean drinking water. Risk is highest for humanitarian aid workers; those working in refugee camps or slums; those caring for people with cholera. - [Diphtheria](/advice/disease-prevention-advice/diphtheria): spread person to person through respiratory droplets. Risk is higher if mixing with locals in poor, overcrowded living conditions. - [Hepatitis A](/advice/disease-prevention-advice/hepatitis-a): spread through consuming contaminated food and water or person to person through the faecal-oral route. Risk is higher where personal hygiene and sanitation is poor. Risk is highest for those with underlying medical conditions where there is increased risk of severe disease e.g. chronic liver/kidney disease; haemophiliacs; men who have sex with men; people who inject drugs. - [Hepatitis B](/advice/disease-prevention-advice/hepatitis-b): spread through infected blood and blood products, contaminated needles and medical instruments and sexual intercourse. Risk is higher for long stays, frequent travel and for children (exposed through cuts and scratches), those who may require medical treatment during travel. Risk is highest for those with underlying medical conditions where there is increased risk of severe disease e.g. chronic liver/kidney disease; haemophiliacs; men who have sex with men; people who change partners frequently; people who inject drugs. - [Japanese Encephalitis](/advice/disease-prevention-advice/japanese-encephalitis): spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. This mosquito breeds in rice paddies and mainly bites between dusk and dawn. Risk is highest for long stay travellers to rural areas, particularly if unable to avoid mosquito bites. - [Rabies](/advice/disease-prevention-advice/rabies): spread through the saliva of infected animals (especially dogs, cats, bats and monkeys), usually through a bite, scratch or lick to broken skin. Risk is higher for those working or living in remote or rural areas (with no easy access to medical facilities), longer stay travellers, those planning on undertaking activities such as trekking, cycling or running in a ['high risk'](/advice/disease-prevention-advice/rabies/rabies-risk-areas)country, those working with, or regularly handling animals or bats, as part of their job, and children. Even after receiving pre-travel rabies vaccine, urgent medical advice should be sought after any animal or bat bite. - [Tetanus](/advice/disease-prevention-advice/tetanus): spread through contamination of cuts, burns and wounds with tetanus spores. Spores are found in soil worldwide. A total of 5 doses of tetanus vaccine are recommended for life in the UK. Boosters are usually recommended in a country or situation where the correct treatment of an injury may not be readily available. - [Typhoid](/advice/disease-prevention-advice/typhoid): spread mainly through consumption of contaminated food and drink. Risk is higher where access to adequate sanitation and safe water is limited. Malaria Malaria is a serious and sometimes fatal disease transmitted by mosquitoes.You cannot be vaccinated against malaria. Malaria precautions [Malaria Map](/destinations/asia-east/india/india-malaria-map) - Malaria risk is present throughout the year. Risk is highest in north-eastern states of Meghalaya, Mizoram, district of Amini in Arunachal Pradesh, north and south Chhattisgarh, Odisha (Orissa) and the city of Mangalore. In central Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Tripura and Arunachal Pradesh risk is not high enough to warrant antimalarial tablets for most travellers, however, it may be considered for certain groups who may be at higher risk (see below under Low risk with additional advice). - There is low to no risk in all other areas. - Check with your doctor or nurse about suitable antimalarial tablets. - See [malaria map](/destinations/asia-east/india/india-malaria-map)- additional information can be found by clicking on the Regional Information icon below the map. - High risk areas: [atovaquone/proguanil](/advice/malaria/atovaquoneproguanil)OR [doxycycline](/advice/malaria/doxycycline)OR [mefloquine](/advice/malaria/mefloquine)are usually advised. - Low risk with additional advice: antimalarial tablets are not usually recommended, however, they can be considered for certain travellers who may be at higher risk e.g. longer stay in rural areas, visiting friends or relatives, those with medical conditions, immunosuppression or those without a spleen. [Atovaquone/proguanil](/advice/malaria/atovaquoneproguanil)OR [doxycycline](/advice/malaria/doxycycline)OR [mefloquine](/advice/malaria/mefloquine)is advised for those at risk. - Low to no risk: antimalarial tablets are not usually advised - If you have been travelling in a malarious area and develop a fever seek medical attention promptly. Remember malaria can develop even up to one year after exposure. - If travelling to an area remote from medical facilities, carrying [standby emergency treatment](/advice/malaria/sbet-standby-emergency-treatment-for-malaria)for malaria may be considered.
