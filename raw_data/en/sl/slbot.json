You can purchase these ingredients at most dispensaries, but if you want to cook up your own infusions/extracts from scratch, you've come to the right place.\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab1\\\" >How to calculate infusion doses</h2>\\r\\nCreating infusions that contain a specific amount of THC, CBD, or other cannabinoids is challenging and may be nearly impossible to do if you've grown your own cannabis, because potency varies based on the plant strain, how it's grown, dried, and cured, and other variables.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, if you start with flower from a reputable dispensary, it should be labeled with the weight of the product (in grams) and the concentration of each cannabinoid (as a percentage).\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing those two numbers, you can make your own cannabis-infused butter (such as Buddha Budda) and have a pretty clear idea of how much of each cannabinoid is in the entire batch. You just have to do the math:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Multiply the number of grams of flower by 1,000 to determine the number of milligrams.\\r\\n</strong>1 gram of flower is 1,000 milligrams; 2 grams of flower is 2,000 milligrams, and so on.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Multiply the number of milligrams of flower by the percentage of a specific cannabinoid in the flower.\\r\\n</strong>For example, if you have 2,000 milligrams of flower with 15 percent THC, you have 2,000 mg \u00d715 = 300 mg THC.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nAfter doing the math, you know that if you use 2 grams of that flower and one stick of butter to make your Buddha Budda, you're going to have about 300 mg THC in the resulting stick of butter.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore basic math is required to determine the total amount of a cannabinoid in an entire batch of a recipe:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Divide the quantity of infused product called for in the recipe by the total quantity of infused product you made to find the percentage of infused product you used.</strong>\\r\\nFor example, if a recipe calls for 4 tablespoons (Tbsp) of infused butter, and you made one stick of infused butter, 4 Tbsp / 8 Tbsp (the number of tablespoons in an entire stick) = 1/2 or 50 percent.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Multiply the result from Step 1 by the total amount of cannabinoid in the entire stick to find out the total amount of cannabinoid in the recipe.</strong>\\r\\nFor example, if the stick of cannabis-infused butter contains 300 mg THC, then half the stick contains 150 mg.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nNow you're ready to determine the amount of cannabinoid per serving. Simply divide the amount of cannabinoid in the entire batch by the number of servings the recipe produces. So, if a batch of cookies contains 150 mg THC and makes 12 cookies, 150 mg THC / 12 cookies = 12.5 mg THC per cookie.\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips tip\\\">If you don't have specifics regarding the amount of THC in the flower you have, look up the strain online and see if you can find any information about it.

You can spread it on toast or muffins, melt it on waffles or pancakes, or use it to substitute for butter in any of your your own extracts or concentrates, the potency of the finished product varies depending on the amount of flower you use and its potency. Some plant strains have higher concentrations of CBD, THC, and other cannabinoids than other plants do.

After 15-20 minutes, check the temperature of the cannabis with your digital temperature gun; once it has reached 250\u00b0F, let it bake for 30 minutes, checking the temperature frequently. (In addition to decarboxylating, you're removing any moisture left in the plant material.) If it goes over the correct temperature for too long, it will burn, the THC may convert into CBN, and you will lose potency. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.

(If by chance it does go over 200\u00b0F for a few minutes, don't worry, it isn't ruined. The THC is still in there. But excessive heating causes degradation of THC and may convert it to CBN, one of the cannabinoids responsible for the sedative effects of cannabis, or result in vaporization of the compounds. Inadequate heating isn't good either, as it causes the majority of the cannabinoids to remain in their acid form and thus unactivated. The density of the product, and the time and temperature of the oven, can also prevent some conversion, which results in unactivated cannabinoids. Adding the decarbed cannabis to the butter or coconut oil and heating it again ensures a better conversation.) Mostly, you want to keep everything at a simmer, not a boil.

Using a large spoon or potato masher, press as much as you can through the cloth. Then, using your hands (rubber gloves help here!), squeeze the bag. Press out as much of the precious liquid as you can. Measure the amount of liquid (infused butter) remaining. Expect a 25 percent loss; this is not a loss of THC, only of butter. Make up the difference with regular melted butter.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nBuddha Budda can be stored in an airtight container for up to 8 weeks in the refrigerator.

(In addition to decarboxylating, you're removing any moisture left in the plant material.)\\r\\nIf it goes over the correct temperature for too long, it will burn, the THC may convert into CBN, and you will lose potency. If not using immediately, store the cannabis in an airtight container in a dark place for up to two months.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li>Remove the baking dish from the oven and reduce the oven temperature to 200\u00b0F.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li>Transfer the cannabis to a mason jar. Pour in just enough alcohol to cover it, and seal the jar. Shake the jar every 3-5 minutes for 20 minutes, then open the lid.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li>Line a strainer with a coffee filter and place it over a bowl. Pour the alcohol solution through the coffee filter to strain off the plant matter. Gently press with the back of a spoon or your fingertips, being careful not to break the filter.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li>Place the sugar in a heat-proof glass pie dish. Add the strained alcohol solution to the sugar and bake for 30 to 60 minutes, stirring well every 10 minutes, until all the liquid has evaporated and the sugar is evenly colored. (The color can range from light to dark amber.)</li>\\r\\n \\t<li>Store in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. There is no need to refrigerate. Hey Sugar!

The truth is that we can't provide specific guidelines because the variables are so numerous. Products differ. Consumers differ. Situations differ. What's too much for one consumer is not enough for another.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome people achieve the experience they want with <em>microdosing \u2014</em> taking a small dose (1-5 mg daily) of a non- or slightly intoxicating cannabis product to enhance overall health and productivity without getting high. Others achieve optimal results with megadoses of up to 2,000 mg daily without experiencing adverse side effects.\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips remember\\\">More isn't necessarily better, although it can be. Increasing the dose up to a certain point initially produces stronger effects, but beyond that point, the desired effects may become weaker with an increase in <a href=\\\"https://www.dummies.com/health/cannabis-health-and-safety-risks/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">adverse side effects</a>. However, increasing the dose beyond the point at which it produces the desired effects may, in some cases, produce additional desirable effects.</p>\\r\\nThe best approach is to follow the age-old wisdom of starting low and going slow and experimenting with products that have different concentrations and ratios of cannabinoids and different terpenes until you find <em>your</em> sweet spot.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing is some additional guidance by helping you define the experience you desire and evaluate some of the key factors that typically impact the experience. Our hope is that by following our guidance, you can find your sweet spot faster and reduce the amount of trial and error \u2014 although trial and error can make the experience more enjoyable as well.\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab1\\\" >Define your desired cannabis experience</h2>\\r\\nPeople consume cannabis for different reasons. Some take it for pain relief or seizure prevention. Others take it at parties to relax and remove some of their inhibitions. Some take it to boost their productivity or enhance their athletic performance. And many certainly take it to feel the buzz.\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips remember\\\">To determine the optimal dose of cannabis for you, first define your desired experience. The experience you want can certainly change over time, and it may change based on the situation. For example, after a long, hectic day at work, you may want to use cannabis to relax, whereas pain relief may be your goal if you've suffered a physical injury.</p>\\r\\nAfter identifying your desired experience, you'll find it easier to match the product, amount, and delivery method to best hit that target. If the desired effect is an uplifting experience in a social setting with friends, smoking flower may be the best choice. If relaxation at the end of a busy day is the outcome, similar to a glass of wine with dinner, perhaps a soothing cannabis tea or bath would be best to deliver the desired result.\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab2\\\" >Consider the chemical composition of products</h2>\\r\\nWhether you're smoking flower/bud, vaping oil, consuming edibles or tinctures, or using a cannabis lotion, consider the chemical composition of the products. Different blends of cannabinoids, terpenes, herbs, and other ingredients produce very different effects that can vary among individuals.\\r\\n<h3>Know your strains</h3>\\r\\nNumerous strains (breeds) of cannabis plants exist, but they all originate from two primary strains: indica (sometimes referred to as \"in da couch\" for its sedative properties) and sativa (a more stimulating strain). The table compares the general effects from these two major strains.\\r\\n<h3>Indica and sativa are only two of many strains. These two primary strains have been cross bred to create numerous hybrids with colorful names, such as Blue Dream, Pineapple Express, AK-47, Chernobyl, and Tangerine Dream. To add to the variety, these strains come in numerous <em>phenotypes \u2014</em> variations resulting from the interaction of the plant's genotype (nature) and environment (nurture).\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips tip\\\">To find out more about the various strains and phenotypes and their effects, check out the <a href=\\\"https://www.leafly.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">Cannabis Strain Explorer at Leafly</a>. For a specific recommendation, describe the effect you desire to your budtender, who can suggest various strains that are likely to do the trick.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips remember\\\">Evaluating products by strain is only one way, and not necessarily the best way, to determine whether a product will deliver the desired effects. You may find that cannabinoid concentrations and ratios and terpene profiles provide a better indication of the effect a product is likely to have. However, strains provide a quick and easy way to reference and talk about different products, especially if you've discovered certain strains you really like.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Check out cannabinoid ratios and amounts</h3>\\r\\nCannabinoids are the primary active ingredients in all cannabis products, so the ratios and quantities of the different cannabinoids provide a fairly accurate indication of what you can expect from any given product.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough cannabis contains about 100 cannabinoids (by some estimates), only two (THC and CBD) are responsible for delivering a majority of the benefits (and any adverse effects) and only two others are notable at this time:\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC):</strong> THC takes most of the credit for producing the euphoric high associated with cannabis. It's strongly psychoactive, meaning it changes brain function, which can result in alterations in mood, memory, perception, thinking, and behavior.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Cannabidiol (CBD):</strong> CBD can help alleviate symptoms of certain medical conditions, such as pain, inflammation, and anxiety, without the intoxicating effects associated with THC. In fact, CBD tends to modulate the psychoactive effects of THC.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Cannabinol (CBN):</strong> When THC oxidizes, it converts to CBN, which decreases the concentration of THC. CBN is a fairly strong sedative that provides other potential benefits. It can be helpful as a sleep aid, pain reliever, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-convulsive, and appetite stimulant and has been shown to promote bone growth.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Cannabigerol (CBG):</strong> CBG is a precursor (building block) of THC and CBD. Like CBD, it's not intoxicating, and it may help with a host of medical conditions, including glaucoma, inflammatory bowel disease, Huntington's disease, cancer, bacterial infections, cachexia (muscle wasting), and bladder dysfunction.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\nWhen shopping for cannabis products, examine the amount of each cannabinoid in the product and their ratios. The CBD-to-THC ratio is particularly important and should be included on the packaging of any cannabis product. Ratios can be broken down into the following three categories:\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>THC dominant:</strong> High THC and low to no CBD produces the intoxicating, euphoric high associated with cannabis. However, higher ratios of THC have a greater potential to produce the adverse side effects.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Balanced:</strong> Balanced blends of CBD and THC are psychoactive, but less so than THC-dominant products. The CBD tends to lessen the intoxicating effect of the THC, and the two cannabinoids may work synergistically to enhance the overall experience.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>CBD dominant:</strong> High CBD and low to no THC products are primarily for those who seek the medicinal benefits of CBD without the intoxicating effects of THC. However, even if you're consuming cannabis purely for medicinal purposes, a little THC added to the CBD can improve its effectiveness.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips remember\\\">Ratios tell you nothing about the <em>amount</em> of each cannabinoid in a product. Also check the amount per serving if you're purchasing adult recreational products and the total amount of each cannabinoid (typically in milligrams) in the entire package. When dosing, pay particular attention to the amount of THC, because consuming too much may increase the risk of adverse effects. High doses of CBD are unlikely to produce any serious adverse effects.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Take a spin on the terpene wheel</h3>\\r\\n<em>Terpenes</em> are the volatile aromatic compounds that give different strains and even individual plants their unique aromas. (Terpenes are part of products and natural substances not exclusive to cannabis.)\\r\\n\\r\\nCombining different terpenes with different cannabinoids produces what's referred to as an <em>entourage effect</em> \u2014 the synergy of all ingredients in a cannabis product that produce the unique experience associated with that product. Think of the combination in terms of wine: CBD and THC content is like a wine's alcohol content, but each wine has its own aroma, flavor, acidity, and texture, which are comparable to the characteristics of terpenes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis table lists and describes the eight most prevalent terpenes in cannabis:\\r\\n<table>\\r\\n<tbody>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td><strong>Terpene</strong></td>\\r\\n<td><strong>Aroma</strong></td>\\r\\n<td><strong>Found in</strong></td>\\r\\n<td><strong>Benefits</strong></td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Caryophyllene (CYE)</td>\\r\\n<td>Pepper, spicy, woody, tip\\\">Terpene characteristics and benefits are often presented in the form of a terpene wheel. You can find numerous terpene wheels online by searching for \"terpene wheel.\"</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Sample other ingredients</h3>\\r\\nCannabis is commonly combined with other ingredients to intensify the effects of the cannabis or of the other ingredients and enhance the consumer experience. Other ingredients commonly added to cannabis products include tobacco, coffee, tea, chocolate, alcohol, herbs, and spices.\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab3\\\" >Compare methods of cannabis consumption</h2>\\r\\nHow you consume cannabis can have a tremendous impact on the way it affects you, including the speed and intensity of your response and the overall sensation. The following table lists your options and presents pros and cons of each to provide you with a quick reference guide for choosing a method that's most conducive to the desired effect in any given acting</td>\\r\\n<td>May be more smoking)\\r\\n\\r\\nLess intense onset</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td width=\\\"132\\\">Edibles</td>\\r\\n<td width=\\\"203\\\">Discreet\\r\\n\\r\\nLong-lasting\\r\\n\\r\\nEasy to on both mind and body</td>\\r\\n<td>Slow acting\\r\\n\\r\\nHighest calorie option\\r\\n\\r\\nDifficulty or vaping</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n</tbody>\\r\\n</table>\\r\\n \\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips remember\\\">Some people have a favorite consumption method they rely on exclusively. Others like to switch it up or use different methods for different purposes or in different situations; for example, smoking socially and vaping when alone.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab4\\\" >Account for other medications or substances used</h2>\\r\\nWhile some medication may have little to no known interaction with marijuana, others are well known to intensify its effects, and many can have unintended consequences based on the type of cannabis and an individual's health. For example, some strains or blends can increase a person's blood pressure raising the risk of heart attack or stroke in vulnerable individuals.\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips warning\\\">Don't mix marijuana with alcohol or other psychoactive substances. If you have a history or family history of any medical conditions or you take any medications (prescription or over-the-counter) or supplements, consult your physician before using cannabis.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab5\\\" >Examine your body's biochemistry</h2>\\r\\nTwo people who consume the same cannabis at the same dose in the same way at the same place and time can have a vastly different experience. These differences can be attributed primarily to variations in their biology and chemical makeup (and perhaps in their emotional state or mind-set, as well). Factors that may impact your biochemistry and thereby influence the experience you have include the following:\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Age:</strong> Many users report that their experience with cannabis has changed over time; for example, cannabis that once helped them relax now makes them feel anxious, or cannabis that once made them paranoid now makes them feel more creative.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Gender:</strong> Cannabis appears to affect men and women differently, although the research in this area is limited. For example, in small doses, cannabis seems to increase sexual desire in women, whereas in men, smoking or vaping cannabis reduces sexual desire and sperm production.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Recent meals:</strong> Whether you've eaten anything before consuming cannabis and what you've eaten can impact its effects, especially with edibles. Consuming cannabis on an empty stomach increases the rate at which it is absorbed, thus increasing the potential risk of anxiety and paranoia. Certain foods may intensify the effects, whereas others modulate the effects; for example, mangoes are thought to intensify the high, whereas lemon is thought to lessen it.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Body composition:</strong> Your height and weight, or more accurately your ratio of muscle mass to fat-soluble tissue may impact the onset time and the intensity and duration of the effects. THC binds to fat, which is why meals can impact the effects of cannabis. Your body's makeup may also have an impact. It may also be involved in determining how long THC may be identified in your body through testing.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Altitude:</strong> The effects of high altitude together with the effects of the cannabis itself can make you <em>feel</em> higher, so if you're consuming at a high-altitude location, particularly a location you're unaccustomed to, start lower and go slower to find your sweet spot. This is a recognizable effect with alcohol, as well.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Genetic disposition:</strong> Genes (heredity) play a major role in how any given individual responds to cannabis. Just as amphetamines (stimulants) tend to calm people who have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a cannabis strain that makes one person anxious may have a calming effect on another.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Consumption frequency (tolerance):</strong> Regular heavy cannabis users build up a tolerance for it. Over time, you may find that you need higher doses to experience the same effects.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Susceptibility to certain mental health conditions:</strong> Certain people are more susceptible to certain mental health conditions (such as anxiety, depression, and psychosis) than others, so they may be more prone to experiencing adverse effects, especially at high doses.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab6\\\" >Consider your environment and mood</h2>\\r\\nJust as a restaurant's ambience, the people you're dining with, and the person who's serving you all impact your enjoyment of your meal at a restaurant, the environment, the people you're with, and your own mood or mindset influence your overall cannabis experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, if the cannabis doesn't suit your tastes, you're not going to have the greatest experience, but assuming it's the right product, and you're in an enjoyable setting with great people and are in a good place yourself, you can expect to have a delightful experience. On the other hand, if you're in an uncomfortable situation with unfamiliar people and are feeling uptight, you may have a terrible experience, even if you're consuming the right product.\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips remember\\\">Start lower and go slower in unfamiliar situations with unfamiliar people or when trying any cannabis products you haven't used in the past. Also, if you know you're going to be consuming in an unfamiliar setting or with strangers, avoid trying any new products. If possible, bring your own product \u2014 one you've used in familiar and comfortable surroundings \u2014 so you're better able to anticipate your response to it.</p>\",\"description\":\"If you're a cannabis novice, you're probably wondering, \"How much should I take?\" The answer to that question is simple: Take as little as possible to produce the desired effect and avoid potential adverse that answer provides little to no practical guidance for new cannabis users. The truth is that we can't provide specific guidelines because the variables are so numerous. Products differ. Consumers differ. Situations differ. What's too much for one consumer is not enough for another.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome people achieve the experience they want with <em>microdosing \u2014</em> taking a small dose (1-5 mg daily) of a non- or slightly intoxicating cannabis product to enhance overall health and productivity without getting high. Others achieve optimal results with megadoses of up to 2,000 mg daily without experiencing adverse side effects.\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips remember\\\">More isn't necessarily better, although it can be. Increasing the dose up to a certain point initially produces stronger effects, but beyond that point, the desired effects may become weaker with an increase in <a href=\\\"https://www.dummies.com/health/cannabis-health-and-safety-risks/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">adverse side effects</a>. However, increasing the dose beyond the point at which it produces the desired effects may, in some cases, produce additional desirable effects.</p>\\r\\nThe best approach is to follow the age-old wisdom of starting low and going slow and experimenting with products that have different concentrations and ratios of cannabinoids and different terpenes until you find <em>your</em> sweet spot.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing is some additional guidance by helping you define the experience you desire and evaluate some of the key factors that typically impact the experience. Our hope is that by following our guidance, you can find your sweet spot faster and reduce the amount of trial and error \u2014 although trial and error can make the experience more enjoyable as well.\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab1\\\" >Define your desired cannabis experience</h2>\\r\\nPeople consume cannabis for different reasons. Some take it for pain relief or seizure prevention. Others take it at parties to relax and remove some of their inhibitions. Some take it to boost their productivity or enhance their athletic performance. And many certainly take it to feel the buzz.\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips remember\\\">To determine the optimal dose of cannabis for you, first define your desired experience. The experience you want can certainly change over time, and it may change based on the situation. For example, after a long, hectic day at work, you may want to use cannabis to relax, whereas pain relief may be your goal if you've suffered a physical injury.</p>\\r\\nAfter identifying your desired experience, you'll find it easier to match the product, amount, and delivery method to best hit that target. If the desired effect is an uplifting experience in a social setting with friends, smoking flower may be the best choice. If relaxation at the end of a busy day is the outcome, similar to a glass of wine with dinner, perhaps a soothing cannabis tea or bath would be best to deliver the desired result.\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab2\\\" >Consider the chemical composition of products</h2>\\r\\nWhether you're smoking flower/bud, vaping oil, consuming edibles or tinctures, or using a cannabis lotion, consider the chemical composition of the products. Different blends of cannabinoids, terpenes, herbs, and other ingredients produce very different effects that can vary among individuals.\\r\\n<h3>Know your strains</h3>\\r\\nNumerous strains (breeds) of cannabis plants exist, but they all originate from two primary strains: indica (sometimes referred to as \"in da couch\" for its sedative properties) and sativa (a more stimulating strain). The table compares the general effects from these two major strains.\\r\\n<h3>Indica and sativa are only two of many strains. These two primary strains have been cross bred to create numerous hybrids with colorful names, such as Blue Dream, Pineapple Express, AK-47, Chernobyl, and Tangerine Dream. To add to the variety, these strains come in numerous <em>phenotypes \u2014</em> variations resulting from the interaction of the plant's genotype (nature) and environment (nurture).\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips tip\\\">To find out more about the various strains and phenotypes and their effects, check out the <a href=\\\"https://www.leafly.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">Cannabis Strain Explorer at Leafly</a>. For a specific recommendation, describe the effect you desire to your budtender, who can suggest various strains that are likely to do the trick.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips remember\\\">Evaluating products by strain is only one way, and not necessarily the best way, to determine whether a product will deliver the desired effects. You may find that cannabinoid concentrations and ratios and terpene profiles provide a better indication of the effect a product is likely to have. However, strains provide a quick and easy way to reference and talk about different products, especially if you've discovered certain strains you really like.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Check out cannabinoid ratios and amounts</h3>\\r\\nCannabinoids are the primary active ingredients in all cannabis products, so the ratios and quantities of the different cannabinoids provide a fairly accurate indication of what you can expect from any given product.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough cannabis contains about 100 cannabinoids (by some estimates), only two (THC and CBD) are responsible for delivering a majority of the benefits (and any adverse effects) and only two others are notable at this time:\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC):</strong> THC takes most of the credit for producing the euphoric high associated with cannabis. It's strongly psychoactive, meaning it changes brain function, which can result in alterations in mood, memory, perception, thinking, and behavior.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Cannabidiol (CBD):</strong> CBD can help alleviate symptoms of certain medical conditions, such as pain, inflammation, and anxiety, without the intoxicating effects associated with THC. In fact, CBD tends to modulate the psychoactive effects of THC.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Cannabinol (CBN):</strong> When THC oxidizes, it converts to CBN, which decreases the concentration of THC. CBN is a fairly strong sedative that provides other potential benefits.

No. CBD doesn't get you high because it has nothing resembling psychoactive, psychedelic, or hallucinatory properties.</p>\\n<p>The cannabis plant, hemp's cousin, became famous as a psychedelic drug. Cannabis contains hundreds of chemical compounds. CBD is one of them, as is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the substance responsible for creating the psychedelic experience. But the fact that CBD and THC appear in the same plant doesn't mean they're the same thing in form or function.</p>\\n<p>Legally, full-spectrum or broad-spectrum CBD products can have up to 0.3 percent THC, but that amount won't get you high. Make sure you're buying quality products with reputable origins and proper testing and labeling, and you don't need to worry about the high issue.</p>\\n<p>Anybody in the cannabis space as a whole will tell you that no one has ever fatally overdosed from using cannabis. The studies and anecdotal evidence around CBD all indicate that the side effects are few and far between. And these side effects are only mildly relevant in the scheme of things, especially compared to what you're trying to treat.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips warning\\\">The more serious side effects include possible contraindications with pharmaceutical or over-the-counter drugs. Some of these medications are processed through the liver, as is CBD. Check with your doctor regarding all the drugs you're taking and the spectrum of potential drug interactions between those and CBD.</p>\\n\"},{\"title\":\"Addressing conditions and medical concerns with CBD\",\"thumb\":null,\"image\":null,\"content\":\"<p>The most common CBD offering is full-spectrum tinctures, but you can also find capsules, powders, balms, and salves. Some companies create very targeted ingredients with CBD; some make products with CBD and other ingredients designed to address specific conditions.</p>\\n<p>Research and anecdotal evidence for the many uses of CBD continue to expand. Broad applications showed success in inflammatory relief, and evidence indicates CBD can address topical conditions like eczema, scarring, and acne. Now researchers are testing extra functions such as antimicrobial and antifungal qualities.</p>\\n<p>CBD may also help the more than 50 percent of Americans who suffer from chronic pain, sleep, and anxiety conditions. Help with chronic and acute pain, stress reduction, and relief from depression and sleeplessness are some of the reported internal benefits of CBD.</p>\\n<p>Other applications include gut health, mental fog, arthritis, exercise fatigue, and more. The formal medical uses are limited because of CBD's novelty, but they show a lot of promise.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips tip\\\">Finding the right dose is important when you start using CBD for your particular needs. <em>Titration</em> is the process of determining how much you need to take to get the effect you want.

The extraction method of choice is based on the desired end product, as presented in the following table.\\r\\n\\r\\n[caption terpene juice</td>\\r\\n<td width=\\\"131\\\">Butane or propane</td>\\r\\n<td>Flower for shatter and wax\\r\\n\\r\\nFrozen flower for live resin, THC crystalline, and terpene for cannabis</h2>\\r\\nThe most common non-solvent extraction methods use water or a combination of heat and pressure. These methods are much easier than solvent methods to perform safely and typically are less strictly regulated.\\r\\n<h3>Dry sift</h3>\\r\\n<em>Dry sift</em> consists of physically knocking the trichomes off the flower and collecting them to produce kief. Many herb grinders have three chambers; as you grind your flower, it falls into the second chamber that has a screen on the bottom through which the kief passes, collecting in the third chamber. To produce larger volumes of kief, you can use silk screening equipment to separate the kief from the plant matter.\\r\\n<h3>Hand rolling</h3>\\r\\nOne of the oldest methods for making hash is hand rolling. You start with fresh cannabis (not dried or cured) and gently roll it between the palms of your hands. The sticky trichomes come off the plant and stick to your hands. You can then scrape the substance off or continue to rub your hands together to create a sticky ball or stick of hash \u2014 commonly referred to as \"charas.\"\\r\\n<h3>Ice water or dry ice</h3>\\r\\nIf you're interested in creating your own concentrates, the ice water and dry ice methods are safest and easiest. The process consists of placing flower in ice water to freeze the trichomes and then agitating the mixture to knock the trichomes off the flower. You then filter the mixture through progressively smaller screens to remove the plant matter. You place the wet hash in a cool, dark place to dry it, and then you press it into cakes to create hashish \u2014 technically referred to as <em>bubble hash</em>.\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips remember\\\">You can smoke bubble hash or use it as an ingredient in edible products.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Pressure and heat</h3>\\r\\nTo create rosin, you apply pressure and heat to flower, kief, or bubble hash. You can purchase a rosin press that's built specifically for the job or use a hair straightener or T-shirt press. You place your starting flower, kief, or bubble hash between two pieces of parchment paper or in a small-micron bag and squeeze it between two heated metal plates.\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips tip\\\">You can whip rosin by stirring it to create a consistency that's more like peanut butter, which may make it easier to handle and to mix with other edible ingredients, but whipping may reduce its potency.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Heat and butter</h3>\\r\\nBy baking cannabis and then simmering it in butter and water, you can create your own cannabis-infused butter. When it cools, the butter separates out from the water, and you can discard the water. You can then use the butter to create your own edibles.\\r\\n<h3>Alcohol</h3>\\r\\nBy baking cannabis and then simmering it in alcohol, you can create your own tinctures, which you can take sublingually or add to beverages.\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab2\\\" >Solvent extraction methods for cannabis</h2>\\r\\nIn solvent extraction processes, a solvent is added to the plant material. Pressure and temperature are then altered to enable the solvent to dissolve the desired components of the plant. Any remaining solvent is removed, leaving behind the oils, cannabinoids, and terpenes extracted from the plant.\\r\\n\\r\\nThink of solvent extraction methods like brewing a pot of coffee. You pour hot water over coffee grounds contained in a filter. The hot water acts as a solvent, extracting the caffeine and the substances that give coffee its aroma and flavor. The filter removes all the plant matter \u2014 the ground coffee beans. Although hot water isn't the greatest solvent for cannabis, the concept is the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nBelow, we describe several different solvent extraction methods, so you have a general idea of what's involved in each process.\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips warning\\\">Don't try any solvent extraction method at home. Combinations of solvents, heat, pressure, and even static electricity can result in deadly explosions.</p>\\r\\nIf you work in an extraction facility, safety is your top priority. Many regulatory bodies require closed loop systems, which allow only minute amounts of solvents into the surrounding air; the result is that volatile fumes can easily build up in the contained spaces of a facility.\\r\\n\\r\\nFacilities employing this type of extraction should include filters, fire resistant building materials, sensors, alarms, and safety protocols. Personnel should be required to wear fireproof coverings and anti-static footwear (to prevent sparks). Any plastic materials, including plastic bags, which are susceptible to creating static electricity, should be banned. Even the smallest spark can ignite the volatile gasses and cause an explosion. Personnel must be trained properly on all processes and procedures and should perform their duties with the utmost care and diligence.\\r\\n<h3>Butane, propane, or both</h3>\\r\\nButane and propane are commonly used as solvents to create extracts referred to as <em>butane hash oil (BHO)</em> or <em>propane hash oil (PHO).</em> Depending on the raw materials and the process, the extracts produced vary in consistency and include shatter, wax, budder, live resin, THC crystalline, and terpene juice, most of which you can purchase at a dispensary.\\r\\n\\r\\nRegardless of whether the solvent used is butane, propane, or a combination of the two, the process is generally the same. Plant matter is placed in a column with a screen at one end, and butane passes through the column, extracting the cannabinoids and terpenes from the plant matter. The solution is then placed in a vacuum oven to <em>purge</em> (evaporate) the solvent, leaving behind the BHO or PHO, which should contain very little to no solvent.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn commercial facilities, butane and propane extractions also involve manipulating pressure and temperature. Pressurizing and chilling the gas converts it to a liquid, which can then be mixed with the plant matter to create a \"soup.\" A vacuum oven uses heat and depressurization to convert the solvent back into its gas form, and the gas is reclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe process is most safely performed using a <em>closed loop system</em> \u2014 an automated or semi-automated system that regulates the parameters of the process. Due to the hazards associated with these solvents, many regulatory bodies require special licensing and permits to perform butane and propane extractions. A closed loop system uses heat to reclaim the gas from the \"soup\" prior to placing it in the oven.\\r\\n<h3>CO<sub>2</sub></h3>\\r\\nCO<sub>2</sub> extraction is similar to that of butane and propane extraction in that it manipulates the temperature and the pressure of a gas to extract substances from cannabis plants. However, CO<sub>2</sub> extraction has some notable benefits:\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n \\t<li>The CO<sub>2</sub> extraction process kills any mold or bacteria in the processed plant matter, as it does in the butane and propane extractions.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li>Pressure and temperature can be manipulated to extract selected compounds from the plant instead of just a combination of all compounds blended together.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li>The process doesn't involve the use of volatile gasses. However, due to high pressures, the process isn't completely safe. CO<sub>2</sub> tanks and other equipment have been known to explode.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\nThe one potential drawback of CO<sub>2</sub> extraction is that the extracts may lack the flavor profile (due to a loss of terpene content) present in BHO and PHO.\\r\\n\\r\\nOil produced by CO<sub>2</sub> extraction is used in almost every vaporizer (vape) device on the market. It's also used for dabbing and to manufacture a wide variety of MIPs, including edibles and lotions. Terpenes are sometimes added back into the CO<sub>2</sub> oil to add desired flavors and aroma.\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips warning\\\">You may have heard about Rick Simpson Oil (RSO), named after its creator, who claims it cured his cancer. While we respect Mr. Simpson's work and especially his dedication to helping others, we caution you not to try it yourself. His method involves the use of toxic, volatile solvents along with boiling off the solvents. The fumes can be very harmful and, when combined with the heat needed for the boiling-off process, susceptible to explosion.

Some of the more common short-term (transitory) and long-term adverse effects of cannabis are mentioned in this article to call your attention to the potential downside of using or abusing products contain different concentrations of different cannabinoids \u2014 the primary active components in cannabis. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the psychoactive component that high. Cannabidiol (CBD) doesn't produce an intoxicating effect but can make you drowsy and lower your blood pressure, so it's not risk-free.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2 >Undesirable transitory effects can produce a number of undesirable effects that arise particularly when the concentration of THC is high and the consumer consumes too much. These effects are transitory; that is, they go away over time, assuming the person stops consuming for several hours. Undesirable transitory side effects include the following:\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Impaired motor control:</strong> Slowed reflexes and impaired physical coordination negatively impact your ability to drive or operate machinery.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Impaired memory and cognition:</strong> Your ability to learn or remember, to think or communicate clearly, or to make decisions may be diminished. These adverse side effects could negatively impact a consumer's performance at school or at work and compromise their problem-solving and communication skills.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Altered perception of time:</strong> Cannabis can make you feel as though time has slowed down. You may like or dislike this feeling, but it can pose a safety risk if you're crossing the street, driving, operating machinery, or even cooking. Of course, it may also make you feel as though you've accomplished more in less time.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Anxiety or paranoia:</strong> Although cannabis is generally associated with a calm sense of bliss, it can increase anxiety to the point of paranoia or even delusional thinking (distorted thoughts or emotions) or psychosis (a break with reality). Whether cannabis calms or creates anxiety can be related to the person, the product, the dose, the person's state of mind, or a combination of factors.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Light headedness or fainting:</strong> Cannabis may cause a temporary drop in blood pressure (if you're susceptible) that can make you feel lightheaded or dizzy or may cause you to faint.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Increased heart rate:</strong> Cannabis can raise a person's heart rate for up to three hours after the effect kicks in, which may increase the chance of heart attack in those with pre-existing vulnerabilities. If you're older or have a history or family history of cardiovascular issues, you should be aware of this fact.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\nAnother transitory issue to consider is the fact that THC remains in the body (in fat-soluble tissue) long after it has been consumed, which increases the potential of failing a drug test. While testing is improving, current tests are unable to differentiate residual from recent-use THC. Typically, THC is detectible in bodily fluids for up to 30 days, but for daily heavy users, that period may extend to more than 90 days!\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab2\\\" >Potential long-term complications of cannabis</h2>\\r\\nLong-term health problems related to cannabis are typically associated with continuous heavy usage over months or years.

Driving under the influence of marijuana is both dangerous and illegal.</p>\",\"description\":\"Cannabis does pose certain risks to the health and safety of some consumers and others, especially if the consumer fails to use responsibly. Some of the more common short-term (transitory) and long-term adverse effects of cannabis are mentioned in this article to call your attention to the potential downside of using or abusing products contain different concentrations of different cannabinoids \u2014 the primary active components in cannabis. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the psychoactive component that high. Cannabidiol (CBD) doesn't produce an intoxicating effect but can make you drowsy and lower your blood pressure, so it's not risk-free.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2 >Undesirable transitory effects can produce a number of undesirable effects that arise particularly when the concentration of THC is high and the consumer consumes too much. These effects are transitory; that is, they go away over time, assuming the person stops consuming for several hours. Undesirable transitory side effects include the following:\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Impaired motor control:</strong> Slowed reflexes and impaired physical coordination negatively impact your ability to drive or operate machinery.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Impaired memory and cognition:</strong> Your ability to learn or remember, to think or communicate clearly, or to make decisions may be diminished. These adverse side effects could negatively impact a consumer's performance at school or at work and compromise their problem-solving and communication skills.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Altered perception of time:</strong> Cannabis can make you feel as though time has slowed down. You may like or dislike this feeling, but it can pose a safety risk if you're crossing the street, driving, operating machinery, or even cooking. Of course, it may also make you feel as though you've accomplished more in less time.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Anxiety or paranoia:</strong> Although cannabis is generally associated with a calm sense of bliss, it can increase anxiety to the point of paranoia or even delusional thinking (distorted thoughts or emotions) or psychosis (a break with reality). Whether cannabis calms or creates anxiety can be related to the person, the product, the dose, the person's state of mind, or a combination of factors.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Light headedness or fainting:</strong> Cannabis may cause a temporary drop in blood pressure (if you're susceptible) that can make you feel lightheaded or dizzy or may cause you to faint.</li>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Increased heart rate:</strong> Cannabis can raise a person's heart rate for up to three hours after the effect kicks in, which may increase the chance of heart attack in those with pre-existing vulnerabilities. If you're older or have a history or family history of cardiovascular issues, you should be aware of this fact.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\nAnother transitory issue to consider is the fact that THC remains in the body (in fat-soluble tissue) long after it has been consumed, which increases the potential of failing a drug test. While testing is improving, current tests are unable to differentiate residual from recent-use THC. Typically, THC is detectible in bodily fluids for up to 30 days, but for daily heavy users, that period may extend to more than 90 days!\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab2\\\" >Potential long-term complications of cannabis</h2>\\r\\nLong-term health problems related to cannabis are typically associated with continuous heavy usage over months or years. Possible adverse long-term side effects include the following:\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n \\t<li><strong>Breathing difficulties:</strong> If you choose smoking as your method of consuming cannabis, you're at an increased risk of having respiratory issues, including bronchitis, lung infections, wheezing, and coughing. As with tobacco, the combustion of cannabis plant material produces tar and other toxins, carcinogens, and irritants that are unhealthy for the lungs.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"article-tips remember\\\">You can avoid this particular long-term side effect by not smoking cannabis.
