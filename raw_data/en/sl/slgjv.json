The doctors are focused on you, they listen and try to understand the whole story, not just the symptoms that are bothering you today. They investigate causes for your discomfort, and explore connections between them all. With a broader understanding of the whole picture they can develop a non-invasive holistic treatment plan that enhances your body's ability to heal itself. As integrative medicine doctors, we can combine conventional with holistic and naturopathic medicine. The difference is we are interested in treating causes not symptoms. And, we prefer naturopathic treatments to pharmaceuticals. Nutrition is an important component of many treatments because vitamins, minerals, and nutrients are not foreign to the body. They can be just as effective, or even more effective than conventional treatments. Clinical nutrition programs can improve conditions such as diabetes, fatigue, obesity, and fibromyalgia.
