A breaking down of the old so that the new can arise. It is a common term in the spiritual healing world, and generally understood as the process by which a spiritual awakening unfolds. Many of us identify with this term as part of our life's purpose; The healing of deep wounds, and, as a result, the deepening of our consciousness. We move through our pain, discovering patterns and limitations, and in the process, uncover a truer version of ourselves. Transformation often brings great freedom, joy, and a connection with one's own inner consciousness. This connection is the key to a life of satisfaction and fulfillment, a life in which we are able to realize our dreams and be a force of incredible good in the world around us. What do you mean by \"connection to consciousness?\" Like...God, or what? Source, God, Higher Power \u2014 It's really all the same thing. A greater energy that we are both a part of and connected to. Our source and our home, it is the energy we are immersed in before birth, and where we return when we die. As a human being, we embody only a small portion of the greater consciousness that we actually are. In addition to the \"me\" that is living a life on Earth, a greater aspect of who we are is continually guiding us, supporting us, and cheering us on energetically. You may know this presence as your conscience, your gut, or your heart. It can also show up as a feeling of longing, the feeling that \"there must be something more,\" which is actually the gentle presence of the greater you, reminding you that you are not alone. When we can align ourselves with the greater \"us\" that is always available to guide us, we tap in to a power much greater than that which we posses alone. We have all seen spiritual leaders \u2014 impactful, amazingly dynamic people who spark passion and ignite the hearts of the masses. These folks are lined up with the greater part of themselves, which makes them a powerful presence of good, because they have access to the greater \"them.\" So, then, what's the deal? Why aren't we all lined up with the greater \"us\" all of the time? Habit. Most of us are simply not in the routine of listening to the inner voice. We may discount it, or don't feel like we can actually trust ourselves. Many of us were taught in childhood that we could not trust ourselves, and so we stopped listening to our inner voices, and instead, began looking to the outer world for approval. Trauma. Many of us have lived through challenging, uncomfortable, and even horrifying circumstances and experiences. We feel damaged, injured, and have had a hard time recovering. With a PTSD-like response to life, we feel unable to function \"normally\" because the littlest things seem to set us off. We can feel unsafe and out of control, even when logically, we know everything is fine. Stress. Living in the world today can be very harrowing, not allowing for much time to reflect and rejuvenate. In fact, the whole idea of self work and transformation is seen as a luxury and somewhat self-indulgent, and it is often viewed as a badge of honor to be busy and stressed, almost to the breaking point. But what if taking care of ourselves is the most responsible thing to do? I don't know anyone who is a better parent, friend, teacher, or spouse when they are feeling imbalanced and dissatisfied with life. In fact, EVERY SINGLE PERSON I KNOW is a better person when they are happy. Connecting with our true self, lining up with the greater part of us brings an ease and a satisfaction with life, and that is a win for all involved. It is worth the time, work, and discomfort to go through the transformation process, because life on the other side will blow your mind. Taking the time to reflect, to FEEL, and to make friends with the skeletons in our closets is the most worthwhile self-care there is. If you are knee-deep (maybe neck-deep!) in the transformational, spiritual awakening process, chances are you've felt stuck at one point or another. Maybe you've identified a trauma in childhood, a situation that impacted you greatly. Or maybe you just feel tired \u2014 you know you want more out of life, but the next step is unclear. Homeopathy can help. All stuckness, all disease, and all illness is the result of a root energetic imbalance, a misattunement in our vital energy that prevents us from fully aligning with our inner consciousness in a meaningful and lasting way. This is why we often feel blocked, stuck, or just a bit off, experiencing limiting and sometimes debilitating stress responses that don't serve us. Whether we experience panic attacks related to a past trauma, or we simply feel depleted to the point of debility, the imbalance comes from the same place \u2014 our core vibrational energy. All matter holds vibrational resonance, and human beings are no exception. When our energy is resonating optimally, we are able to glide with the movement of life rather than experiencing daily life as a panic-inducing assault, or an exhausting burden, experiences which severely restrict our enjoyment of life. Often the result of a coping mechanism gone awry, these out-of -proportion stress responses to everyday life can keep us feeling anxious, depressed, and overwhelmed. We can clearly see that the stress we experience is limiting us and does not serve our highest good, but we seem to be powerless to do anything about it. Enter Homeopathy. Developed over 200 years ago by a German Physician, Homeopathy has stood the test of time as one of the world's most effective healing modalities. Homeopathy's most common applications are with diseases, both acute and chronic, and it is widely used in Europe and India as an everyday medical modality. In addition to being helpful for physical symptoms, Homeopathy's effects on the emotional and spiritual levels of an individual are profound. Using minute doses of plant, animal and mineral substances, Homeopathic remedies stimulate a healing response in an individual's system to allow vibrational alignment, bringing ease, freedom, and clarity. By matching the vibrational resonance of the misattunement of the individual, a Homeopathic remedy is able to stimulate energetic healing at the root level, allowing long held vibrational patterns of imbalance to dissolve over a period of time. A homeopath views an individual as a totality, and understands that seemingly unrelated symptoms from multiple body systems are in fact, related. Symptoms and stressors are viewed as expressions of the underlying imbalance, and it is the Homeopath's job to understand the nature of this imbalance and match it with a remedy that will bring relief on the vibrational level. But it's not a quick fix or an overnight cure. Rather, Homeopathy helps us open the door to healing at a foundational level, offering opportunities for integrating parts of ourselves that we have been holding at bay, while employing emotional survival mechanisms that carry a high price tag. As we are able to come face to face with ourselves, our scars, and our wounds, the process of healing can begin. When we are able to sit with these previously denied aspects of ourselves that arise during Homeopathic care, our inner consciousness will softly start to speak. And as we move toward balance, we spend less of our energy needing to cope and survive. We are able to show up in life with more vitality, presence, and authenticity. This is the true meaning of transformation \u2014 To walk THROUGH the fire, to face ourselves like never before, and to emerge reborn, renewed, with hope and focus for the future. My most rewarding work as a Homeopath has been walking through the process of awakening and transformation with clients who are on a journey of deep, deep healing. It is truly awe-inspiring to witness the shifts that occur during this process as clients step into their power and reclaim their lives. This is soul work at its finest. If you are feeling stuck in your transformation journey, I hope you will give Homeopathy a try. The life you have always dreamed of can be a reality, and I would be honored to walk this path with you. "}
