However, relatively little is known about the effects of vaccine communica- tion on vaccine attitudes and immunization behavior. Previous research suggests that common communication approaches may be ineffective or even counterproductive, especially among vaccine-hesitant parents. However, these studies typically rely on observational data or self- reported measures of vaccination intention. Using novel research designs, we tested the attitu- dinal and behavioral effects of messages encouraging vaccination in both a survey experiment conducted among a large sample of parents in Vermont who expressed hesitancy about child- hood immunizations and a eld experiment among parents whose children were overdue for vaccines. We nd that neither a message promoting immunization as a social norm nor a mes- sage correcting common misperceptions about vaccines was measurably more effective than a standard public health message at improving parents' attitudes toward vaccines, intention to vaccinate their children, or compliance with the recommended vaccine schedule. Our results highlight the need for more research on approaches to successfully reducing vaccine hesitancy among parents. Keywords: vaccine hesitancy, childhood vaccines, public health, misperceptions, myths, facts, normsIntroduction The recent resurgence in measles and subsequent COVID-19 pandemic underscore the need for more effective vaccine communication strategies. Although vaccine compliance is high in the United States, many states do not meet Healthy People 2020 goals for kindergarten vaccination rates. The proportion of kindergarteners with at least one exemption from state immunization requirements was 2.5% in 2018-2019, up from 2.1% in 2016-2017, and as high as 7.7% at the state level (Seither et al. 2019). Coverage remains below Healthy People 2020 targets for a number of vaccines, including DTaP, Hepatitis A, and Hepatitis B (Ofce of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion 2020). Despite widespread agreement on the goal of increasing vaccine compliance, relatively little is known about how to most effectively promote vaccines to hesitant parents (Sadaf et al. 2013), who are often confused by unscientic information they encounter from anti-vaccine activists (Kata 2012; Ruiz and Bell 2014). Some approaches that are used to promote vaccination to parents may be ineffective or even counterproductive, though results vary. For instance, Nyhan et al. (2014) nd that corrective information debunking the vaccine-autism myth reduced parents' self- reported intention to vaccinate relative to a control condition, but Zhang et al. (2020) nd that exposure to fact-checking labels improves attitudes toward vaccines relative to people who see only misinformation. The vaccine communication challenge is especially acute in Vermont, a state where vaccine hesitancy was identied as a contributing factor to non-medical exemptions years before it became a national concern. Although Vermont was the rst state to eliminate the philosophical exemption for school entry in 2015 in response to high exemption rates (6.1% among kindergartners in the 2014-2015 school year compared to a median of 1.7% among states nationally; Seither et al. 2015), maintaining high rates of immunization remains an ongoing challenge, especially given the prevalence of misinformation both locally and nationally (e.g., Ghorayshi 2017; Noyes 2017). After Vermont eliminated the philosophical exemption, for instance, it saw a seven-fold increase in the percentage of kindergartners with religious exemptions, a group that grew from 0.5% in 12011-2012 to 3.5% in 2019-2020 (Vermont Department of Health 2020; Williams et al. 2019). Assuring Vermont parents that vaccines are safe and effective thus remains a major public health objective in the state. This project responds to the call for more systematic research on how to best promote vaccina- tion (e.g., Bloom, Marcuse, and Mnookin 2014). We conducted two preregistered studies testing the efcacy of two communication strategies that are frequently used to promote vaccination. First, we tested a message emphasizing the social norm around vaccination that reminded parents of the consensus in favor of vaccination to prevent disease in Vermont. A second message took the ap- proach of refuting common myths about vaccines using facts and science. Our study compared the effects of each of these messages with standard messaging currently used by the Vermont Depart- ment of Health (VDH). The rst study, which we refer to as the general parent study, was conducted among a sample of Vermont residents who are parents or guardians of one or more children age ten or younger who completed survey measures of their vaccine beliefs and attitudes and self-reported intent to vacci- nate their children. We specically focused on parents who expressed hesitancy about childhood immunizations as measured by the PACV outcome scale (Opel et al. 2011, 2013). The second study, which is referred to as the non-compliance study, was conducted on a sample of Vermont residents who are parents or guardians of 8-month old and/or 20-month-old children who were overdue for recommended vaccines. In both studies, data from the Vermont immunization registry were collected several months later to assess the effect of public health messaging on parents' vaccination decisions. Our results showed no effect of either message on parents' attitudes and beliefs about vaccines, their intention to vaccinate their children, or their subsequent compliance with the immunization schedule (relative to a control condition with no information). Contrary to expectations, we also nd no measurable difference in vaccine attitudes, intention to vaccinate, or a behavioral measure of vaccine compliance for either treatment compared to standard messaging used by the Vermont Department of Health. These ndings suggest that vaccine attitudes are not easily changed by pub- 2lic health messaging and suggest the need for additional research on strategies to improve attitudes and compliance among hesitant parents. They also highlight the need to study the effects of these interventions on larger samples, as such an approach may be more likely to provide evidence of small but measurable differences in the population (e.g., Chen et al. 2020). Hypotheses We preregistered a series of hypotheses at the Center for Open Science prior to launching our study (URL: https://bit.ly/307MhgS ). First, we expect the social norm treatment to improve vaccination attitudes and behavior. Studies of the effects of social norms in other domains demon- strate that emphasizing social norms can motivate environmental conservation, reduce prejudice and harassment, and even increase people's likelihood of voting (e.g., Goldstein, Cialdini, and Griskevicius 2008; Gerber, Green, and Larimer 2008; Paluck and Green 2009). The social norms treatment in our study is designed to work via two mechanisms (Cialdini, Kallgren, and Reno 1991). First, it increases the salience of the descriptive norm that most Vermont parents vaccinate. Second, it highlights the injunctive norm that they should vaccinate to protect their children and others from communicable disease. Bicchieri and Dimant (2019) dene this combination as a so- cial norm and argue that it is generally most successful at affecting behavior. We therefore expect the following: H1: Reminders of the social norm in favor of vaccination will increase vaccine- hesitant parents' favorability toward vaccines (H1a), their self-reported intention to vaccinate (H1b), and their children's vaccination compliance (H1c) compared to a control condition. We also expect that correcting myths about vaccine safety will increase the accuracy of people's beliefs about vaccines. Several survey experiments have demonstrated that corrections can lower the perceived accuracy of false statements about immunizations (e.g., Cameron et al. 2013; Reavis et al. 2017). For example, Nyhan nd that corrective information signicantly 3reduced parents' (false) belief that the flu vaccine can give you the flu. We therefore hypothesize the following: H2: Correcting myths about vaccine safety will increase the accuracy of beliefs about the effects of vaccines among vaccine-hesitant parents compared to a control condi- tion. However, ndings are mixed for whether or how corrections affect intent to vaccinate or im- munization behavior. Nyhan et al. (2014) and Nyhan and Reifler (2015) nd that corrective in- formation actually decreased intent to vaccinate among parents with the least favorable vaccine attitudes. By contrast, Pluviano, Watt, and Della Sala (2017) and Reavis et al. (2017) nd no effects on intention to vaccinate and Horne et al. (2015) nd positive effects on vaccine attitudes. Research examining effects on actual immunization behavior is more sparse, but Glanz et al. (2017) nd that a web-based social media intervention administered during pregnancy can improve the likelihood that women vaccinate their infants. Similarly, Chen et al. (2020) nd a small increase in overall vaccination rates among seniors who received postcards from the Louisiana Department of Health reminding them to get the influenza, tetanus, shingles, and pneumonia vaccines. Because our theoretical expectations are not clear, however, we offer a research question about the influence of correcting myths on vaccination outcomes.1 RQ1: Does correcting myths about vaccine safety affect vaccine-hesitant parents' fa- vorability toward vaccines (RQ1a), their self-reported vaccinate (RQ1b), or their children's vaccination compliance (RQ1c) compared to a control condition? Methods Our studies received approval from the Vermont Agency of Human Services Institutional Review Board and two university IRBs, the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at Dartmouth 1We detail three additional preregistered research questions in the Online Appendix. 4College, and the University of Michigan Health Sciences and Behavioral Sciences Institutional Review Board (IRB-HSBS). The Commissioner of the Vermont Department of Health (VDH) approved use of VDH data for the project under a Data Use Agreement. We followed slightly different protocols for the general parent and the non-compliance studies and describe each below. General parent study: Recruitment In the general parent study, we used Vermont immunization registry data to identify parents or legal guardians of at least one child 10 years old or younger who was a Vermont resident. We then sent one recruitment mailing per household via a mail rm inviting those parents or guardians to participate in an initial pre-treatment survey (Wave 1). The list of eligible participants for Wave 1 was constructed as follows. After excluding children who were deceased, VDH identied records of 75,638 children whose parents met these criteria. VDH completed an initial address de-duplication to limit recruitment to a single child per house- hold, retaining only the youngest child when there were multiple children with the same address. Records of 65 children in state custody were removed as well as one child who was deceased since the original record pull. A professional mailing rm working under secure conditions performed an additional address de-duplication and removed those with a documented out-of-state change of address. A trial mailing was sent to 550 randomly selected addresses a few days in advance of the main mailing. These households accordingly had additional time to complete the survey. A total of 52,565 recruitment letters were sent to households with at least one parent or guardian of a child who met the aforementioned criteria in the main mailing, with 44,797 of these delivered. The Wave 1 survey remained open for 14 days from the nal day on which the letters arrived. The letters invited parents to participate in a \"Vermont Parental Study\" online by navigating to a URL provided in the letter and entering a unique access code (see Figure A1 in the Online Appendix for a sample mailing). Parents were also offered incentives in the form of a $5 .00 gift card to encourage survey participation. Upon navigating to the online survey, parents who chose to participate completed a series of questions on their children's names and birth dates (which we 5used to match them to VDH immunization registry data), their own demographics (see Table 1), and their attitudes toward vaccines. To measure vaccine attitudes, we used the Parent Attitudes about Childhood Vaccines (PACV) scale (Opel et al. 2011, 2013). More details on the composition of this scale and how we constructed our outcome measures are included in the Online Appendix. The survey also asked parents to provide their email address if they were interested in being re- contacted to participate in the Wave 2 study. A total of 2,332 parents completed Wave 1 of the survey for a response rate of 5.2%, which is comparable to other studies that recruit participants by mail (e.g., Carey et al. 2020). After closing the Wave 1 survey, we calculated PACV scores as a measure of vaccine hesitancy among parents. Those whose PACV score was in the top two-thirds of the distribution (a score of 6.7 or higher on the 100-point PACV scale2and corresponding to higher vaccine hesitancy)3were then re-contacted via email and invited to participate in the second survey (Wave 2), which contained our vaccine messages and survey outcome measures. Parents were again offered a gift card as an incentive to participate. In order to hold the lag between Waves 1 and 2 constant across participants, we sent individual invitations approximately 14 days after each participant completed Wave 1. After seven days, we sent one additional email reminder. The Wave 2 survey remained open for 14 days. A total of 940 parents completed Wave 2 of the survey, which represented 59.9% of the Wave 1 participants we invited to the second wave.4We then merged these data with the available data from the immunization registry and were left with a nal sample size of 678 parents corresponding to 1,070 children. We were unable to match 262 parents to child immunization registry data, explaining 2Responses to the PACV scale in Wave 1 were skewed heavily to the right, indicating that the majority of partic- ipants were not very vaccine-hesitant. The exact tercile splits for the 100-point PACV scale were scores imately 0-6.7 for the lowest tercile ( N=761, which were not invited to Wave 2), for the middle tercile (N=799), and 16.7-100 ( N=770) for the top tercile. studies nd slightly higher average PACV scores (e.g., Opel et al. 2011; Henrikson et al. 2015; Glanz et al. 2017). A possible explanation is that a mailed survey invitation from the Vermont Department of Health might have been more appealing to parents with pro-vaccine attitudes than to vaccine-hesitant parents who may distrust public health institutions. 3An alternative approach would be to focus on parents who stated that they had ever delayed giving their child a required immunization (PACV1) or declined to do so (PACV2). However, this behavior is relatively rare (see Table 1 for summary statistics), so we opted to conduct our study among the broader group of parents who scored in the top two-thirds of hesitancy on the PACV composite scale. 4After downloading the raw data, we removed participants with missing outcome data. For a small number of participants who took the survey twice using the same code (perhaps on different devices), we kept only the rst response. 6the drop in sample size for the behavioral outcomes.5Due to data privacy concerns, we cannot denitively identify the source(s) of the failed matches, but a likely explanation is discrepancies between the names and/or birthdays of the children reported in the survey and the corresponding records in the immunization registry. Table 1 summarizes how the demographics of participants in the general parent study compare to the Vermont population as a whole. As Table 1 shows, our sample closely matches Vermont's racial composition (94% white). Further analysis shows that it also closely approximates the ge- ographic distribution of people across Vermont, including the percentage of the population living in an urban area (58.6% versus 59.8% in Census data) and in our coverage of zip codes (responses were recorded from 90.4% of zip codes in Vermont). Overall, the distribution of participants by zip code in our sample is correlated with the Vermont population by zip code ( r=0.86). See the Online Appendix (Table A1 and Figure A5) for more details on the geographic representation of our sample. The sample differed from the Vermont population in three respects. First, as parents of young children, our participants were unsurprisingly more likely to be ages 25-44 than Vermonters as a whole. The individuals who responded to the survey were also overwhelmingly female (though our invitations did not specify which parent or guardian). Participants reported higher levels of educational attainment than Vermonters as a whole, though a substantial fraction reported us- ing Medicaid and/or SCHIP, suggesting that the sample remains economically diverse. Finally, vaccine-hesitant behaviors were relatively rare among the sample despite our use of PACV scores to determine eligibility for Wave 2; less than a quarter of respondents reported ever having delayed or declined to give their child a required shot. 5Since this data cleaning process removed a sizable portion of our sample, we conducted an exploratory analysis of the effect of messaging on the survey outcomes alone without any control variables derived from immunization registry data among the larger sample of 940 parents. These results, which we report in Table A4 and Figure A6 in the Online Appendix, are substantively identical to those reported in the main text. 7Table 1: General parent study participant demographics Wave 1 Wave 2 VT pop.

There were no Native Hawaiian/Other Pacic Islander individuals in our sample, so we grouped in- dividuals in those categories into the \"Other\" category for the Vermont population data (where they comprise 0.1% of the population). The full wording for the PACV1 and PACV2 items is included in the Online Appendix. 8General parent study: Vaccine messages Wave 2 of the survey included our vaccine messages. Participants were randomly assigned into one of four treatment conditions that varied whether or not they read a letter from VDH and the content of the letter. In the rst condition, which served as a pure control, participants did not read any information from VDH. In the second (standard pro-vaccine message) condition, participants read a standard message from VDH about the importance of getting vaccinated that includes infor- mation on how to nd a provider. In the third (social norm treatment) condition, participants read a message that included the text from the standard message but also reminded parents of the social consensus in Vermont to vaccinate to protect everyone from disease. In the nal (myths and facts treatment) condition, participants read a message that included text from the standard message but also refuted common myths about vaccines with information from experts. The full text of each vaccine message is provided in the Online Appendix (see Figures A2-A4). After the treatment messages, participants were again asked a series of outcome questions that are described in the next section. General parent study: Outcomes Our analysis includes three survey outcome measures and two behavioral outcome measures. The survey outcome measures tap three different dimensions of parents' attitudes toward vaccines in Wave 2: their PACV outcome score (recoded such that higher values indicate lower vaccine hesi- tancy), which is comprised of a subset of questions from the PACV scale; their factual beliefs about vaccines, which is measured using two post-treatment survey questions about whether vaccines are safe and whether they have serious side effects; and their vaccine behavioral intentions, a measure based on two post-treatment survey questions about whether parents would follow the vaccination schedule if they were to have another child. We conrmed that each scale is unidimensional using principal components factor analysis and created composite measures for each after conrming that they did. More details on these questions and the indices we created are included in the Online Appendix. 9With parental consent, we created the behavioral outcome measures based on VDH immu- nization registry data. These data were measured at the child level for each qualifying child in the household. For each child, we calculated a binary up-to-date measure which recorded if each child was up to date on the recommended seven-vaccine series of childhood vaccines (DTap, IPV, MMR, Hib, HepB, Var, and PCV) for their age group, and a continuous measure of the proportion of required doses they have received of the recommended vaccines, which adjusts for variation in the number of series and doses that are recommended for children of different ages.6The latter quantity was calculated as the total number of vaccine doses received in the recommended series over the maximum number that would be required for completion of all of the recommended series for the child's age group (a standard measure in the Vermont immunization program). The total number of vaccine doses required ranged from one to 24 depending on each child's age group (see the Online Appendix for more details on the vaccines required for each age group). We measured both of these behavioral outcomes six months following the close of the second survey wave.7 Non-compliance study The non-compliance study was conducted on a separate sample of parents after closing Wave 2 of the general parent study.8This study tested the effect of similar social norms and myths and facts treatments on immunization status changes among children who were out of compliance with the recommended vaccine schedule. We randomized the content of letters sent from VDH to parents of non-up-to-date (UTD) 8-month-old and 20-month-old children on (approximately) the rst of each month. These ages were selected following established practice for the routine 6An alternative continuous outcome measure is the number of days a child is under-vaccinated (e.g., Glanz et al. 2017); we chose to measure the proportion of vaccines received because we viewed it as the most direct public health outcome and the easiest to interpret, but future research might consider both indicators. 7Data privacy limitations preclude us from identifying what factors (declined vaccines, delayed vaccines, etc.) or which vaccines were most consistently associated with non-compliance. 8Due to an administrative error, we neglected to remove participants in the general parent study from the mailing lists for the non-compliance study as indicated in our preregistration. We therefore ended up with nine parents who participated in the general parent study and also received mailings for the non-compliance study. Because of potential spillover effects of the general parent study onto the non-compliance study, we excluded these individuals from both sets of analyses. 10recall/reminder letters that VDH sends on a monthly basis. The planned follow-up period was six months, but the study was terminated early due to changes in access and lower primary care utilization rates associated with COVID-19. The follow- up period for households who received the mailing ranged from one to four months depending on the mailing month. VDH conducted the randomization at the household level and mailed letters mid-month. Specically, parents were randomly assigned to receive one of three versions of the letter: (1) the standard pro-vaccine message currently in use, which serves as the baseline; (2) a version that includes an additional social norms treatment; or (3) a version that includes an addi- tional myths and facts treatment. These mirrored the treatments in the general parent study (see Figures A2-A4 in the Online Appendix). Behavioral outcome measures mirroring those described above were measured at recruitment and follow-up. Immunization histories were provided by the Vermont immunization registry. VDH calculated up-to-date status at baseline (the start of each month in which the letter was sent) and at follow-up in mid-March. A total of 808 households, including 815 children, were randomized. Follow-up data was available for 618 of the children, corresponding to 613 households.9VDH provided a de-identied dataset for analysis. Results Our analyses employ Ordinary Least Squares regression (OLS) with robust standard errors clus- tered by household for all child-level immunization registry outcomes. In the Online Appendix, we also present regression results for our binary dependent variable in both the general parent study and the non-compliance study (proportion up to date on all vaccines) using probit models (see Table A3). In each model, outcome variables are constructed such that higher values indicate more positive vaccine attitudes, more accurate vaccine beliefs, greater intent to vaccinate, or higher levels of vaccine compliance. 9We excluded 30 children whose parents received letters in March, since they likely would not have had time to get vaccinations before we terminated the study and collected outcome data. 11To examine the precision of these results, we also conduct a series of equivalence tests. The goal of equivalence tests is to explicitly test whether meaningful effects are plausible by dening the bounds of the condence interval that contains the estimate (e.g., Lakens, Scheel, and Isager 2018). Specically, we examine if we can rule out large effects by measuring whether we can reject effects larger than a given effect size. To run this analysis, we use the TOSTER package in R(Lakens 2017), setting the signicance level to p<0.05 (equivalent to two one-sided tests with 90% condence intervals) and selecting tests with unequal variances. General parent study: Outcomes We begin with the survey outcomes for the general parent study. These results are presented in the rst three columns (Models 1-3) of Table 2 and graphically in Figure 1. The statistical models we report in Table 2 control for Wave 1 (pre-treatment) PACV outcome score (recoded such that higher values indicate lower vaccine hesitancy) and mean proportion up to date on all vaccines at the household level before treatment. As the results show, we do not nd support for Hypothesis 1 or 2. Neither the social norms message nor the myths and facts message had a signicant effect on parents' attitudes toward vaccines, the accuracy of their beliefs about vaccines, or their intent to vaccinate a future child. Effects for the standard message were similarly null. Figure 1: General parent study survey outcomes Mean PACV outcome score (recoded; left), accuracy of vaccine beliefs (middle), and vaccine behavioral intent (right) by treatment group for the general parent study. 12Table 2: General parent study message effects on survey and behavioral outcomes Vaccine Vaccine Vaccine Vaccines up to Share of attitudes beliefs intent date (binary) vaccinations (1) (2) (3) (4) No Yes Yes Number of parents 678 678 678 - - Number of children - - - 1,070 1,070 p<0.05. OLS regression models with standard errors shown in parentheses. Estimates are relative to the control group, which was exposed to no information. Control variables include Wave 1 PACV score and baseline proportion up to date on all vaccines at the household level for the vaccine attitudes, beliefs, and intent outcomes and baseline proportion up to date on all vaccines at the child level for the vaccines up-to-date and share of vaccines outcome measures. For each outcome, higher values indicate more positive vaccine attitudes (lower hesitancy), more accurate beliefs about vaccines, higher intent to vaccinate, and higher vaccine compliance. See Methods section and Online Appendix for details on variable construction. The fourth row of Table 2 shows the estimated difference in effects between the myths and facts treatment and the social norms treatment. As the rst column of that row shows, the myths and facts treatment was signicantly more effective at improving attitudes toward vaccines than the social norms treatment. Average Wave 2 attitudes toward vaccines were about three percentage points higher (on the 100-point PACV scale) among participants who read the myths and facts message than among those who read the social norms message. However, this difference is the only signicant effect we observed; there were no other signicant differences between any of the treatments we tested in effectiveness at changing attitudes toward vaccines, accuracy of vaccine beliefs, or intent to vaccinate. Equivalence tests allow us to examine the precision of these null results. Because we hypothe- 13sized that the treatments would have positive effects, we focus on estimating the size of the positive effects that we can condently reject. For example, we can reject positive effects greater than 1.8 percentage points for the effects of the standard message on the PACV score measure of vaccine attitudes (out of 100). We can also reject PACV effects greater than 5.4 percentage points and 1.4 percentage, respectively, for the social norms and myths and facts messages relative to the control condition. In other words, we can be statistically condent that the treatments did not improve vaccine attitudes by more than 1.8, 5.4, or 1.4 percentage points for the respective treatments on the 100-point PACV scale. For the vaccine beliefs outcome, we can reject effects larger than 0.05 on a 1-4.5 scale for the standard message, 0.13 for the social norms message, and 0.06 for the myths and facts message. Finally, for the intent to vaccinate outcome, we can reject effects larger than 0.03 on a 1-4 scale for the standard message, 0.08 for the social norms message, and 0.01 for the myths and facts message. Substantively, these results illustrate that we can condently rule out large positive effects of the treatments on all of our survey outcomes. While small effects remain possible, they would very likely be smaller than the values reported above and as such would not represent fundamental changes in attitudes, beliefs, or vaccination intentions. For instance, an increase of 0.13 on the vaccine beliefs outcome would not change a parent's rating of a true statement about vaccine safety from \"not at all accurate\" to \"not very accurate.\" We now turn to the behavioral outcomes for the general parent study, which are shown graph- ically in Figure 2 and in columns 4-5 of Table 2. These models control for mean proportion up to date on all vaccines at the child level before treatment. We consider two behavioral outcome measures: a binary indicator of whether or not a child is up to date on all of the recommended vaccines for their age group and a continuous measure that divides the total number of vaccines a child has by the total number he or she should have at a given age. Both are measured six months after parents took the Wave 2 survey with the vaccine messages. We nd no signicant effects of any treatment on either our binary indicator of being up to date 14Figure 2: General parent study behavioral outcomes Mean proportion of children who are up to date on all recommended vaccines (left) and mean number of vaccines a child has divided by the total number of vaccines recommended for his or her age group (right) by treatment group six months post-treatment in the general parent study. on vaccines or our continuous measure of vaccination status.10The effects of the standard message, the social norms message, and the myths and facts condition were not statistically different from the control condition with no information, nor were they measurably different from each other. We again conduct equivalence tests to evaluate the effect sizes we can condently rule out. Relative to a control condition with no information, we can condently reject anyincrease in the probability of a child being up to date on all of their vaccines for the standard message. Similarly, we can reject increases in the probability of being up to date larger than 0.05 for the social norms message and 0.04 for the myths and facts message. Finally, we can reject any increase in vaccine share for the standard message for the number of vaccines a child has over the number he or she needs as well as increases in vaccine share larger than 0.02 and 0.01 for the social norms and myths and facts messages, respectively. In substantive terms, these ndings indicate that none of 10In the Online Appendix, we also evaluate the accuracy of parents' past reports of vaccine compliance by regressing our binary and continuous measures of vaccination status on past vaccine behavior (see Table A2). Consistent with Opel et al. (2013), the results suggest that self-reported non-compliance is a strong indicator of actual non-compliance, alleviating concerns about social desirability bias in vaccine behavior reporting. 15the treatments would lead to more than one additional shot for a child of any eligible age in the general parent study compared to receiving no information. Non-compliance study: Outcomes We next turn to the non-compliance study conducted among parents of children who were out of compliance with the CDC's recommended vaccine schedule.11We use the same two behavioral outcomes as in the general parent study. Both are measured between one and four months after the child's parents were sent a letter depending on when the letter was received. Consistent with our preregistration, there are no control variables in these models. Unlike the general parent study, there is not a pure control condition in the non-compliance study in which some parents see no information. All parents whose children were out of com- pliance with the recommended vaccine schedule received a mailing. As a result, the baseline condition in our analyses is the standard message used by VDH. Each coefcient thus represents the difference in effects attributable to the social norms or myths and facts treatment relative to the standard message. Our results, which are presented in Table 3 and graphically in Figure 3, indicate that social norms treatment had no statistically signicant effect on vaccination behavior for either the binary up-to-date measure or the continuous measure of vaccination status relative to the standard message used by VDH. There was also no signicant effect of the myths and facts treatment on either outcome relative to the standard message, and the difference between the social norms treatment and the myths and facts treatment was not signicant. These results provide no evidence that the treatment messages changed vaccine behavior among parents of non-compliant children. Our equivalence test results again rule out the possibility of large effects. Relative to the stan- dard message, we can condently reject increases in the probability of a non-compliant child being 11The non-compliance study data provided by VDH included a small number of children ( n= 71) whose registry information indicates that they were up to date on all of their vaccines before the study. In the interest of transparency, we include these children in the analyses reported in the main text, but we also report analyses that exclude them in Table A5 and Figure A7 in the Online Appendix. The conclusions we draw from those results are substantively identical to those reported in the main text. 16Table 3: Non-compliance study effects on vaccine behavior Vaccines up to Share of date (binary) vaccinations (1) (2) household Yes Yes Number of children 618 618 p<0.05.

For each outcome, higher values indicate higher vaccine compliance. up to date on all of their vaccines larger than 0.08 for the social norms message and larger than 0.12 for the myths and facts message. Moreover, we can reject increases larger than 0.06 for the social norms message and can rule out any signicant positive effects for the myths and facts message on the total number of vaccines a child at a given age has divided by the number the child is supposed to have. In substantive terms, we again have no evidence that either treatment would lead to more than one additional shot for a child in the non-compliance study compared to the standard message used by VDH. Discussion The results of our study suggest that pro-vaccine messaging strategies may fail to improve vaccine attitudes, intentions, and behavior among parents of children in Vermont. Across two studies and ve different outcomes, we nd no signicant effects of messages emphasizing social norms around vaccination or refuting myths about vaccines with scientic evidence relative to either a pure control condition with no information or standard pro-vaccine messaging used by public health ofcials. In contrast to ndings suggesting that standard pro-vaccine reminder messages can increase compliance (e.g., Jacob et al. 2016), we also found that the message currently in 17Figure 3: Non-compliance study outcomes Mean proportion of children who are up to date on all recommended vaccines (left) and mean number of vaccines a child has divided by the total number of vaccines recommended for his or her age group (right) by treatment group in the non-compliance study. use was ineffective relative to a no-information condition \u2014 a result worth revisiting in future research. These ndings corroborate previous research nding limited evidence that messaging strategies change how people think about emotionally charged health issues like vaccinations (e.g., McCaul, Johnson, and Rothman 2002; Gerend and Shepherd 2007; Erceg-Hurn and Steed 2011). Our results do have some important limitations. First, we were only able to test two novel messages in addition to the messaging currently used by the Vermont Department of Health. Other approaches, such as those that effectively invoke potential risks, losses, or fear, could have different effects (e.g., Rothman and Salovey 1997; Witte and Allen 2000; Bartels, Kelly, and Rothman 2010), although these types of framing have also been shown to have counterproductive effects in certain circumstances (Nyhan et al. 2014). The effectiveness of message that incorporate insights from marketing and advertising could also be explored (Eisend and Tarrahi 2016; Rosengren et al. 2020). Especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, research should continue to test other messages that could improve vaccine attitudes and compliance (Facher 2021). Additionally, our partnership with VDH meant that we could not test the effects of messages originating from other 18sources. Given concerns about low trust in the government and public health organizations (e.g., Cooper, Larson, and Katz 2008), perhaps other message sources would be more effective. Third, participants in the control condition in the general parent study were exposed to no in- formation. Future studies should verify that providing information about an unrelated topic in a placebo condition does not produce a different pattern of results. Fourth, we were only able to test the influence of pro-vaccine messages in Vermont, a state that is not very representative of the United States, particularly with respect to racial diversity and urbanization. Future research should examine the effectiveness of vaccine messaging strategies on more diverse and representative sam- ples. Fifth, in focusing on the core survey and behavioral outcomes, we are unable to identify the mechanisms by which messages could change vaccine attitudes and behavior \u2014 another important area for future research. Finally, vaccine attitudes at baseline in the general parent study were more favorable than expected, which meant that our sample included many people who were not very hesitant toward vaccines even after we excluded the third of our sample that was least hesitant. Potential ceiling effects resulting from the presence of these individuals in the sample could help explain why we failed to change vaccine attitudes, beliefs, and intentions with our vaccine messages. Future studies should seek to recruit larger participant samples of individuals with high vaccine hesitancy (as measured by composite PACV score) and/or a history of having delayed or declined vaccines for their children in the past. Despite these limitations, our study makes important theoretical and research design contri- butions. To our knowledge, this is the rst study examining the effects of vaccine messaging strategies on vaccine attitudes, beliefs, intent (as measured in a survey), and real immunization behavior among both parents and children. By combining a survey with public health data, we identify a fruitful approach for future research on vaccine attitudes and behavior, which should more frequently evaluate the effects of interventions using experimental designs and behavioral outcome data. More broadly, these ndings suggest that approaches to changing vaccine behavior should be tested carefully before being implemented by any public health organization. 19Conclusion Our results have important implications for both public health strategies and the design of future studies on vaccine attitudes and behavior. First, we demonstrate that two important strategies that are frequently used to try to improve vaccine attitudes and compliance \u2014 a social norms message and a myths and facts message \u2014 do not improve vaccination outcomes among a large sample of parents and their children. These results illustrate the need for further testing of these and other types of messages (e.g., Nowak, Shen, and Schwartz 2017). It is possible that the effects of messages promoting immunization are similarly effective (e.g., Hallsworth, Mirpuri, and Toth 2021) and that both scholars and practitioners focus too much on differences between messages rather than, e.g., reaching the individuals who may be most likely to change their behavior in response to credible messages. Absent large-scale evaluations on state populations (e.g., Chen et al. 2020), our results also indicate that messaging interventions may be unlikely to generate measurable effects on behav- ior. Immunization programs seeking to test the effects of such messages will need thousands of participants to detect small but potentially meaningful effects on behavioral outcomes. We there- fore recommend that future research on vaccine messaging be deployed among larger participant samples and/or delivered in higher dosages that are more likely to affect vaccine attitudes, inten- tions, and behavior. Indeed, our ndings indicate that reducing vaccine hesitancy is a signicant challenge that may require new and innovative approaches among advocates and policymakers. 20References Bartels, Roger D., Kristina M.

Our design tests the effects of a standard pro-vaccine message used by the Vermont Department of Health. We do not have strong theoretical priors about how this message will affect vaccine attitudes and behavior but are interested in measuring its effects and how they compare to both the social norms treatment and the myths and facts treatment. We therefore offer the following research questions: RQ2: Does a standard pro-vaccine message affect vaccine-hesitant parents' toward vaccines self-reported vaccinate (RQ2b), or their children's vaccination compliance (RQ2c) compared to a control condition? RQ3: Does providing reminders of the social norm in support of vaccination affect vaccine-hesitant parents' favorability toward vaccines (RQ3a), their self-reported in- vaccinate (RQ3b), or their children's vaccination (RQ3c) com- pared to a standard pro-vaccine message? RQ4: Does correcting myths about vaccine safety affect vaccine-hesitant parents' fa- vorability toward vaccines (RQ4a), their vaccinate (RQ4b), their children's vaccination compliance (RQ4c), or the accuracy of their beliefs about the effects of vaccines (RQ4d) compared to a standard pro-vaccine message? We also offer a research question about the effects of our social norm treatment on reported misperceptions about vaccine side effects. Unlike the myths and facts treatment, the social norms A-1treatment is not explicitly designed to reduce perceived accuracy of false information, but we are interested in whether social pressure represents an alternative route by which people might report more accurate vaccine beliefs. RQ5: Do reminders of the social norm in support of vaccination affect reported mis- perceptions about vaccine side effects among vaccine-hesitant parents compared to a control condition (RQ5a) or a general pro-vaccine message (RQ5b)? A-2Sample survey materials Figure A1: Sample general parent study mailing Figure A1 shows a sample mailing that parents invited to participate in Wave 1 of the general parent study received. Identifying information has been redacted. Brendan Nyhan, one of the researchers, was afliated with the University of Michigan at the time the survey was launched. A-3Figure A2: General parent study standard message treatment Figure A2 shows the standard pro-vaccine message experimental condition in Wave 2 of the general parent study. This is a standard message from VDH about the importance of getting vac- cinated that includes information on how to nd a provider. 186 participants who completed the survey were randomly assigned to this treatment group (163 were randomly assigned to the con- trol condition, in which no letter was shown). A similar message was shown for the standard pro-vaccine message experimental condition in the non-compliance study (with 218 participants randomly assigned to the standard pro-vaccine message experimental condition). A-4Figure A3: General parent study social norms treatment Figure A3 shows the social norms experimental condition in Wave 2 of the general parent study. This message includes the text from the standard message but also reminds parents that the social consensus in Vermont in favor of vaccination is strong and that vaccinations protect people in the state from disease. 146 participants were randomly assigned to this treatment group. A similar message was shown for the social norms experimental condition in the non-compliance study (with 193 participants randomly assigned to the social norms experimental condition). A-5Figure A4: General parent study myths and facts treatment Figure A4 shows the myths and facts experimental condition in Wave 2 of the general parent study. This message includes text from the standard message but also refutes common myths about vaccines with information from experts. 183 participants were randomly assigned to this treatment group. A similar message was shown for the myths and facts experimental condition in the non- compliance study (with 207 participants randomly assigned to the myths and facts experimental condition). A-6Outcome variable construction: Vaccine attitudes To measure vaccine attitudes, we used the Parent Attitudes about Childhood Vaccines (PACV) scale (Opel et al. 2011). The full scale is displayed below, with overall PACV scores calculated by summing points across all questions (point values for each response are shown in brackets); note, however, that our PACV outcome variable uses a subset of these items as described below. 1. PACV1: Have you ever delayed having your child get a shot (not including seasonal flu or swine flu (H1N1) shots) for reasons other than illness or allergy? Yes [2] No [0] 2. PACV2: Have you ever decided not to have your child get a shot (not including seasonal flu or swine flu (H1N1) shots) for reasons other than illness or allergy? Yes [2] No [0] 3. PACV3: How sure are you that following the recommended shot schedule is a good idea for your child? Please answer on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is \"not at all sure\" and 10 is \"completely sure.\" 0 (Not at all sure) [2] 1 [2] [2] 3 [2] 9 [0] 10 (Completely sure) [0] 4. PACV4: Children get more shots than are good for them. Strongly agree [2] Agree [2] Not sure [1] Disagree [0] Strongly disagree [0] 5. PACV5: I believe that many of the illnesses that shots prevent are severe. Strongly agree [2] Agree [2] Not sure [1] Disagree [0] Strongly disagree [0] A-76. PACV6: It is better for my child to develop immunity by getting sick than to get a shot. Strongly agree [2] Agree [2] Not sure [1] Disagree [0] Strongly disagree [0] 7. PACV7: It is better for children to get fewer vaccines at the same time. Strongly agree [2] Agree [2] Not sure [1] Disagree [0] Strongly disagree [0] 8. PACV8: How concerned are you that your child might have a serious side effect from a shot? Not at all concerned [0] Not too concerned [0] Not sure [1] Somewhat concerned [2] Very concerned [2] 9. PACV9: How concerned are you that any one of the childhood shots might not be safe? Not at all concerned [0] Not too concerned [0] Not sure [1] Somewhat concerned [2] Very concerned [2] 10. PACV10: How concerned are you that a shot might not prevent the disease? Not at all concerned [0] Not too concerned [0] Not sure [1] Somewhat concerned [2] Very concerned [2] 11. PACV11: If you had another child today, would you want him/her to get all the recom- mended shots? Yes [0] No [2] Don't know [1] 12. PACV12: Overall, how hesitant about childhood shots would you consider yourself to be? Not at all hesitant [0] Not too hesitant [0] Not sure [1] Somewhat hesitant [2] A-8 Very hesitant [2] 13. PACV13: I trust the information I receive about shots. Strongly agree [0] Agree [0] Not sure [1] Disagree [2] Strongly disagree [2] 14. PACV14: I am able to openly discuss my concerns about shots with my child's doctor. Strongly agree [0] Agree [0] Not sure [1] Disagree [2] Strongly disagree [2] 15. PACV15: All things considered, how much do you trust your child's doctor? Please answer on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is \"do not trust at all\" and 10 is \"completely trust.\" 0 (Do not trust at all) [2] 1 [2] 2 [2] 3 [2] 8 [0] 9 [0] 10 (Completely trust) [0] As indicated in our pre-registration, we used a subset of the PACV scale to measure partic- ipants' post-treatment attitudes towards vaccines. Specically, we excluded questions PACV1-2 and PACV14-15, which ask about past vaccination behavior and trust in pediatricians, respectively, because they are unrelated to our experimental treatments. We also excluded PACV11 because it is part of our behavioral intent measure (described below). After excluding these elements of PACV scale, we conducted principal components factor analysis on the remaining Wave 2 PACV vaccine attitudes subscale and conrmed that the items loaded on a single dimension. The rst principal component explains 48.9% of the variance, and the Cronbach's Alpha for the nal scale is 0.489. We then summed the items and rescaled them on a 0-100 scale to create a PACV outcome score. For our analyses, we reverse-coded this scale by subtracting the calculated scores from 100 such that positive coefcients in our regression model would correspond to more positive attitudes to- wards vaccines\u2014a deviation from Opel et al. (2011). We used this outcome to test our hypotheses about the effects of the treatments on vaccine attitudes in the general parent study. We measured factual beliefs about vaccines with the following two questions. A-91. Just based on what you know, how accurate is the following claim? Vaccines are safe for children's immune systems. Very accurate [4] Somewhat accurate [3] Not very accurate [2] Not at all accurate [1] 2. Just based on what you know, how likely is it that children who get a vaccine will suffer serious side effects? Extremely likely [1] Very likely [2] Moderately likely [3] Not too likely [4] Not at all likely [5] We again conducted principal components factor analysis to check whether these two items load on a single dimension. The rst principal component explained 76.0% of the variance, and Cronbach's awas 0.683. We therefore created a composite measure for vaccine belief accuracy by taking an average of the two items. Higher scores indicate more accurate beliefs about vaccines. Finally, we measured vaccine behavioral intentions with the following two questions\u2014one that was adapted from Nyhan et al. (2014) to apply to all vaccines (rather than just MMR) and one that was adapted from the PACV scale (PACV11 but with the word \"child\" substituted for infant because some of the parents in our study no longer have an infant). 1. If you had another child, how likely is it that you would give him/her all of the recommended vaccines? Very likely [6] Somewhat likely [5] Slightly likely [4] Slightly unlikely [3] Somewhat unlikely [2] Very likely [1] 2. If you had another child today, would you want him/her to get all the recommended shots? Yes [3] No [1] Don't know [2] Again, we conducted principal components factor analysis to check whether these two items load on a single dimension. The rst principal component explained 92.9% of the variance, and Cronbach's Alpha was 0.830. We created a composite measure for vaccine behavioral intent by taking an average of the two items. Higher scores indicate higher intent to vaccinate. A-10Outcome variable construction: Vaccine behavior Our behavioral outcome measures come from the Vermont Immunization Registry. These data were measured at the child level for each qualifying child in the household; the statistical analyses reported in the results section of the manuscript cluster on households to account for dependency within families in behavior. Specically, we measured (1) whether each child was fully up to date with the recommended vaccine series (see below) and (2) the proportion of required doses received of the recommended vaccines, which adjusts for the differing number of series and doses at different ages. Children in each age range were expected to have the vaccines listed below for that range regardless of where they fell in that range. We measured both of these behavioral outcomes six months following the close of the second survey wave for the general parent study, and between one and four months after the mailing month in the non-compliance study. The planned follow-up period for the non-compliance study was six months, but was ended early due to changes in access and avoidance of primary care associated with COVID-19. We used the following standard to determine whether a child is up to date (standards vary depending on child's age). Children are expected to have the vaccines listed regardless of where they fall in the relevant age range. For each child, we calculated a binary up-to-date measure and a proportion of doses required to measure whether each child was compliant. We calculated the latter quantity as the total number of vaccine doses received in the recommended series over the maximum number that would be required for completion of all of the recommended series for the child's age group (a standard measure in the Vermont state immunization program). The binary up-to-date measure recorded whether or not each child was up to date on all recommended series for the relevant age group. The required vaccines for each age range are shown below: 1. Birth-2 months (1 series): DTap: MMR: 1 Hib: 4 HepB: 3 Var: 1 (or history of disease) PCV: 4 6. 19 months-6 years (7 series): DTap: 3 MMR: 1 Hib: 4 HepB: 3 Var: 1 (or history of disease) PCV: 4 7. 7 years-10 years (7 series): DTap: 4 MMR: 2 Hib: 4 HepB: Var: 2 (or history of disease) PCV: 4 A-12Sample geographic representation Table A1: General parent study sample vs. Vermont population representation by zip code Zip code Population Population percentage Sample Sample percentage 05401 28913 4.65 20 1.76 05452 05464 3306 0.53 7 0.61 6 0.53 0.16 2 0.18 0.15 1 0.09 05474 956 0.15 5 0.44 05770 943 0.15 1 0.09 05448 941 0.14 2 0.18 05832 879 0.14 4 0.35 05155 871 0.14 1 0.09 A-1405356 864 0.14 2 0.18 05761 844 0.14 3 0.26 05732 792 0.13 5 0.44 05839 767 0.12 2 0.18 0.10 05058 266 0.04 1 0.09 05678 263 0.04 3 0.26 05862 237 0.04 2 0.18 05067 191 0.03 1 0.09 05362 55 0.01 1 0.09 Other 59750 9.60 0 0.00 Table A1 shows the representation of our sample and the Vermont population by zip code.

Sample population data by zip code are provided by the Vermont Department of Health. In the nal row, \"Other\" corresponds to all zip codes represented in the population that are not represented in our sample, whose residents correspond to 9.6% of the Vermont population. Due to data access and anonymity concerns, we were not able to exclude par- ticipants who we excluded from the main analysis in the general parent study for reasons outlined in the main text (missing survey outcome data, missing immunization registry data, administrative error leading to participation in both the general parent study and the non-compliance study for a small number of participants, etc) from our analyses of the geographic representativeness of our sample. Accordingly, the total number of participants in our sample reported in this table and the next gure is slightly different from that which comprises our main analyses.

Zip codes that are not represented in our sample (9.6% of all Vermont zip codes) are omitted.

As the gure shows, representation is similar for all zip codes except 05401, which is Burlington (where there are more individuals in the population that in our sample), and 05452, which is Essex Junction (where there are more individuals in our sample than in the population).

OLS regression models with standard errors shown in parentheses. Table A2 estimates the accuracy of self-reported past vaccine behavior using the PACV1 and PACV2 questions. These questions ask parents whether they have ever delayed giving their child a shot or not given their child a shot for reasons other than illness or injury. After merging the general parent study survey data with the behavioral data from the Vermont Immunization Registry, we estimated a similar model to Opel et al. (2013) using the PACV1 and PACV2 measures as a composite independent variable, which is the sum of the scored values for the PACV1 and PACV2 items on the Wave 1 survey. The dependent variables are the binary and continuous measures for child-level proportion up to date on all vaccines before treatment (in contrast to the dependent variables in our main analyses, which are the proportion up to date post-treatment). We use robust standard errors and cluster at the household level. The results suggest that self-reported non-compliance in the survey is associated with non- compliance in the behavioral data from the Vermont Immunization Registry. A one-unit increase in self-reported non-compliance (where the maximum score is four and the minimum score is zero) is associated with a 9.5-percentage point decrease in likelihood of being up to date on all vaccines and a decrease of 0.04 (on a 0-1 scale) in vaccine share (the number of vaccines a child has divided by the total number the child should have at a given age). A-17Robustness checks Table A3: Probit models for vaccine up to date status (binary) General parent Non-compliance study study (1) (2) Standard Number of children 1,070 618 p<0.05. Probit models with standard errors shown in parentheses. Estimates are relative to the control group, which was exposed to no information. Control variable is proportion up to date on all vaccines at the child level. For each outcome, higher values indicate higher vaccine compliance. Table A3 reports regression results for the binary up-to-date status outcome variable in the general parent study (left column) and the non-compliance study (right column) using probit. We nd no signicant effects, suggesting that our results reported in the main text are robust to model specication. A-18Table A4: General parent study message effects on survey outcomes (larger sample) Vaccine Vaccine Vaccine attitudes beliefs intent (1) (2) (3) Standard household No No No Number of parents 940 940 940 p<0.05. OLS regression models with standard errors shown in parentheses. Estimates are relative to the control group, which was exposed to no information. Control variable is Wave 1 PACV score. For each outcome, higher values indicate more positive vaccine attitudes (lower hesitancy), more accurate beliefs about vaccines, and higher intent to vaccinate. Table A4 and Figure A6 report regression results for the effect of messaging on vaccine at- titudes, beliefs, and intent using all parents with complete survey outcome data ( N=940). The sample used for this analysis is larger than that which we report in the main text. In the main text, we include only parents with complete survey outcome data and child immunization data. These null results suggest that the results we report in the main text are not attributable to sample exclu- sions due to missing registry data. Notably, the difference between the social norms experimental condition and the myths and facts condition on vaccine attitudes (sixth row) that we report in the main text is no longer signicant.

A-20Table A5: Non-compliance study effects on vaccine behavior with 71 observations dropped Vaccines up to Share of date (binary) vaccinations (1) (2) Number of children 547 547 p<0.05. OLS regression models with standard errors shown in parentheses. Estimates are relative to the standard message used by VDH. No control variables. For each outcome, higher values indicate higher vaccine compliance. Table A5 reports the non-compliance study results after dropping 71 observations correspond- ing to children who were up to date on all of their vaccines at Time 1 in the data le supplied by VDH. The results are presented graphically in Figure A7. We observe a signicant effect for the myths and facts condition, suggesting that the myths and facts condition is associated with, on average, a 6-percentage point increase in the share of vaccines a child has, relative to the standard message. We also nd a signicant difference between the myths and facts condition and the so- cial norms condition for the continuous measure, suggesting that the myths and facts condition was more effective at increasing a child's share of vaccines than the social norms condition. However, we do not observe any signicant effects for the binary measure. Taking this result in combination with the other results reported in the main text, we conclude that there are no consistent effects of our treatments on vaccine behavior among parents of non-compliant children.
