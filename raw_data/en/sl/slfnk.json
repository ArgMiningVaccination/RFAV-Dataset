Providing the poor access to medicines is a humane imperative and unless addressed just reinforces the intergenerational cycle of poverty. While affordability is a key aspect, there are other issues as well which need to be addressed to give the poor access to medicines. these include plugging the gaps in health systems and infrastructure that hamper the delivery, procurement practices, tax and tariff policies and the strength of national drug regulatory authorities. Nations also need to develop a system of pharmacovigilance to ensure that the medicines are of good quality and safe so that the poor are protected from substandard medical products. i am optimistic that the government will widen the ambit of its most ambitious health scheme - ayushman Bharat - to strengthen primary care and cover chronic diseases. When that happens our company looks forward to being partners in the health journey of patients who otherwise had limited access to quality medicines.access to medicines calls for the active engagement of various stakeholders including government and industry. as a global research-based pharmaceuticals leader, Novartis has always believed that along with providing returns to its shareholders, it has a social contract with society to provide access to medicines. towards this end, both globally and in india, we provide scalable access solutions, patient assistance programs, equitable commercial models, social business models and drug donations. a stable government at the centre and increased focus on growing the economy will reinforce estimates that india's base- of-the-pyramid population living on a few dollars a day will shrink significantly over the next ten years. Yet for some 850 million men, women and children in more than 640,000 villages across india, the idea of accessible, affordable and high-quality medicines remains as remote as their homes. arogya Parivar, our social business initiative, continues to provide health information, diagnosis, and access to medicines to these underserved populations. in this annual report, we present to our shareholders a glimpse of this remarkable success story. on behalf of the Board of directors, i am pleased to propose a dividend of `10 per equity share of ` 5 at the forthcoming annual General Meeting.i thank you for the confidence you continue to repose in our company and look forward to the same in the years ahead. sincerely, christopher snook chairman NoV artis iNdia LiMited annual report 2018 - 2019 04dear shareholder, it gives me great pleasure to address my first communication to you as Vice chairman and Managing director of Novartis india Limited. i begin my stint at a time that may well see the beginning of a transformation in india's healthcare systems. there certainly seems to be every indication that this could happen in the near to medium term. our country has begun increasing focus on both health and education, the two pillars of a developed economy. according to estimates, the pharmaceutical market in india will reach ` 2255.5 billion by 2023. this wave of opportunity will largely be driven by rising incomes, greater health awareness, increase in lifestyle diseases and growth of health insurance. the National Health Policy (NHP) of 2017 committed the central government to spend 2.5% of the nation's GdP on health by 2025. it also mandated the state governments to spend 8% of their budgets on health. While this is highly aspirational and the state governments are yet to meet this target, directionally as a nation we seem to be going the right way.Limited public funding of healthcare means that india largely follows the self-pay model for healthcare expenses. in such a scenario, the less privileged are hit the hardest. it is estimated that almost one-fifth of the poorest households in india tend to suffer from a catastrophic health shock leading to expenses greater than the annual per-capita consumption of a household. With ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan arogya Yojana (PM-JaY), the government hopes to tackle many of the issues faced by the needy who otherwise had no, or limited, access to healthcare. PM-JaY has certainly drawn global attention. it is arguably the largest public healthcare initiative in the world, covering a population of about 500 million indians. if the official numbers are any indication, this could well be a game-changer in the healthcare sector. While PM-JaY will definitely go a long way towards saving the indigent from catastrophic health shocks, there is much more to be done to achieve the goal of Universal Health coverage. this requires a series of interventions, in addition to PM-JaY, in areas such as investments in health, organization of NoV artis iNdia LiMited annual report 2018 - 2019 our country has begun increasing focus on both health and education, the two pillars of a developed economy. according to estimates, the pharmecuetical market in india will reach ` 2255.5 billion by 202305healthcare services, increased focus on prevention of diseases, promotion of good health through cross-sectoral actions, leveraging access to technologies as well as developing human resources in healthcare. i am confident that the new government will make this a priority. Novartis continues to affirm its commitment to serving patients and society at large. even as our parent company invests in discovering new ways to improve and extend people's lives, we are committed to contribute our efforts to improve access to medicines and healthcare for patients who have limited reach to such facilities. it was with this objective that we launched arogya Parivar, our social business venture, 11 years ago. from a pilot program in two districts, it now extends over 15 states and last year alone arogya Parivar touched 7.8 million lives, hosting more than 10,000 health camps and providing people with better health information through 175,000 health education meetings. this, i believe, is no mean achievement. turning to the performance of our company, we continued to face several challenges. We have, however, taken steps to increase efficiencies in the way we work through various measures including reorganization of people and repurposing our product portfolio. We launched Voveran maxxgel tM and a new version of Voveran\u00ae 1ml and hope that with these launches we will further strengthen our position by serving more patients. revenue from operations for the year ended March 31, 2019, was ` 4,906.8 million as compared to ` 5,638.9 million in the previous corresponding period. total comprehensive income for f.Y. 2018-19 at ` 533.9 million was lower than ` 795.6 million in the previous corresponding period. this was primarily because the previous corresponding period had a substantial tax refund for a prior period of ` 981.3 million. i am happy to share that the Board continues to support a steady dividend policy of 200% for fY 2018-19, subject to your approval. i thank you for the confidence you have placed in our company over the years and look forward to your continued goodwill as we work for the long-term interest of the patient. sincerely, sanjay Murdeshwar Vice chairman & Managing directorfrom a pilot program in two districts, arogya Parivar now extends over 15 states and last year alone it touched 7.8 million lives, hosting more than 10,000 health camps NoV artis iNdia LiMited annual report 2018 - 201906arogya Parivar changing the face of healthcare in rural india NoV artis iNdia LiMited annual report 2018 - 2019as the heat saps dusty lanes of dhaurahra in Uttar Pradesh, 104 kilometers away from its capital Lucknow, the resounding beats of Prem chand Maurya's duggi (drum) burst through the silence. Villagers of all ages run excitedly out of their homes to see what the noise is about and find Maurya, in an arogya Parivar-branded shirt, making his way to the village chaupal . Maurya is a health educator, and a member of Novartis india's social Business team - arogya Parivar - which has impacted lives in underserved and underprivileged rural areas in india for more than a decade. in the chaupal, or community space, he tells them a story, using visual storyboards to drive home his point. the stories that Maurya, and others like him, share at arogya Parivar's health awareness programs carry important messages; like other health educators, or arogya shikshaks as they are better known, he spends his time touring rural areas to speak to villagers in their local dialect about their health and well-being. in this village, which is in the heart of india's carpet-making region, respiratory disorders and parasitical infections are common, and timely treatment can make a big difference. Maurya's talk is the first step of the health awareness program; as he speaks, the villagers realise that in the nearby school building, a volunteer, dr. sonali Maurya, is offering free diagnosis to complement the arogya shikshak's talk. at the request of the arogya Parivar team, she and her husband dr. ajit have visited more than ten villages pro-bono in the Bhadohi-Mirzapur area where dhaurahra lies. for her it is a personal mission; she became a doctor because in her childhood, she had watched her parents struggle to receive healthcare. traveling to these villages through the Novartis program - though with no obligations to prescribe its medicines - she has seen women suffer from complications while giving birth at a young age; she has helped farmers cope with dehydration when hard manual labour has taken its toll, and has treated weavers whose long hours at carpet factories have caused severe infections. Like dr. Maurya had once done, 11-year-old Vijay Kumar in Khulua dreams of being a doctor. When arogya Parivar organized a health camp in this village on the banks of the Ganges in Mirzapur district, Kumar was there. intrigued by the number of people who had assembled for the session, including his parents and friends, Kumar had joined them; he had lost a cousin to an unknown ailment in 2011, and is now aware that diseases can often be prevented, if diagnosed early and treated correctly. He also understands that treatment advised by a doctor is more effective than uneducated self-treatment, and is keen on sharing these insights with classmates in school. THE IMPERATIVE according to the National Health Profile 2018, published by the central Bureau of Health intelligence, india accounts for a relatively large 07NoV artis iNdia LiMited annual report 2018 - 2019 share of the world's disease burden, with non-communicable diseases (Ncds) dominating over communicable ones in the total disease burden of the country. the indian council of Medical research (icMr) report India: Health of the Nation's States: The India State- Level Disease Burden Initiative (2017), notes that while the disease burden due to communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases, as measured using disability-adjusted Life Years (daLYs), dropped from 61% to 33% between 1990 and 2016, non-communicable diseases (Ncds) in the same period increased from 30% to 5%. \"fifteen years ago, the mortality rate was 60% due to infectious diseases; now the trend has reversed and more than 60% of the mortality rate is because of Ncds,\" says Lokesh Manikonda, country Head i ndia, Novartis social Business (NsB). the incidence of communicable diseases is higher in the northern regions of the country, he adds; certainly higher population density and poverty make it worse. as per WHo, worldwide, tuberculosis (tB), a communicable disease which is primarily spread through the air, is one of the top 10 causes of death. there were an estimated 10 million new cases of tB worldwide in 2017. india's record in terms of healthcare access is not very impressive; a May 2018 Lancet report ranks it as 145 th among 195 countries in this regard. as per data released by the Health Ministry, under the National Health Profile in June 2018, there is one government allopathic doctor per 11,082 population, one government hospital bed per 1,844 population and one state-run hospital for every 55,591 population. as per KPMG, 60% hospitals, 75% dispensaries and 80% doctors are located in urban areas, servicing only 28% of the country's population. Public spending on healthcare in the country is currently low, and economies much smaller than i ndia spend a far higher percentage. for example, thailand spends 2.9% of their GdP on healthcare, Bhutan 2.5%, and sri Lanka 1.6%. the Government of india's National Health Policy 2017 speaks of increasing health expenditure as a percentage of GdP from the existing 1.15% to 2.5% by 2025. When arogya Parivar was launched in 2007, it was estimated that only 30% of rural india had access to potable water and just 19% had access to sanitation. While the country has progressed on both fronts, there is much that remains to be done. Malnutrition was, and continues to be, a serious problem; with 47% of children undernourished, india led the global statistics in terms of iron deficiency at the time. over 65% of india's population had limited access to healthcare, a fact made worse by this being largely a self-pay market with less than 4% of the population covered by insurance, making healthcare even more difficult to access. With a strong corporate philosophy of providing medical care to those in need but with limited access, Novartis india recognized that reaching out to rural markets was vital. o ne of the key insights guiding the arogya Parivar initiative was that with greater awareness and availability of affordable treatment, many diseases could be treated, and even prevented. it also acknowledged that people - including the millions in india earning less than three dollars a day - would be willing to spend on healthcare if properly counseled, and if fast-acting and equitably priced smaller packages were available. With clearly defined social and commercial arms that work with a common goal, arogya Parivar has proved to be a profitable business for Novartis, with social service at its heart. this clear separation between the two operations ensures effectiveness, and helps to serve community interests in the best possible way. the 'social unit' is responsible for the health education meetings to inform communities about disease prevention, and benefits of 08NoV artis iNdia LiMited annual report 2018 - 2019Malnutrition was, and continues to be, a serious problem; with 47% of children undernourished, india led the global statistics in terms of iron deficiency at the time. over 65% of india's population had limited access to healthcare09NoV artis iNdia LiMited annual report 2018 - 2019timely treatment; it also provides healthcare services such as screening, diagnosis, and treatment through the camps. the commercial arm, on the other hand, delivers product information to healthcare practitioners. it also ensures that retail pharmacies are stocked with affordable products. A 10-YEAR GROWTH STORY for villagers in more than 16,000 villages, the arogya Parivar, or 'Healthy families' program, has proved to be a boon; it has brought diagnosis and treatment options to those who are often unwilling to seek medical help because it will mean a loss of daily wages, or because it is simply too far away. some of these villagers would otherwise turn to unqualified local quacks; some would try home remedies, while most would simply neglect the problem until a small issue or a preventable illness became a potentially life-threatening one. for these people, who may never have seen a doctor in their lives before, arogya Parivar brings medical help practically to the doorstep. i t also addresses issues such as menstrual hygiene that would otherwise not be discussed because of various social taboos surrounding them. in over a decade of growth, arogya Parivar has expanded from two states to fifteen. the initiative began with 18 on-ground staff; there are now more than 600. With 293 sales supervisors and an equal number of area Health educators - a number that is expected to go up to 300 each by the end of the year - the company works with 300 cells across the country, up from 10 when it first began; cell staff liaise with > 40,000 doctors, > 28,000 chemists and around 500 distributors. there are also plans to bring diagnostics closer to communities by facilitating partnerships between rural physicians and diagnostic companies. in the past decade, arogya Parivar has positively impacted > 50 million indians across 13 states. in 2018 alone, 7.8 million villagers attended more than 10NoV artis iNdia LiMited annual report 2018 - 2019175,000 health education meetings. in addition, more than 468,000 people participated in nearly 10,000 health camps. By 2022, it is expected to have 15 million touchpoints in a year through health education meetings and camps. Based on management guru late c.K. Prahalad's approach of tapping the fortune at the bottom of the pyramid (see box above), this for-profit program is a prime example of responsible social business - offering access to basic amenities in the healthcare sector to underprivileged people, and addressing issues of awareness and supply chain reliability. the diseases that it targets are common in rural areas, but often preventable; they include respiratory infections, skin and gynaecological infections, diabetes, micronutrients during pregnancy and childhood, intestinal worms, acid reflux, cough and cold as well as allergies. to treat these problems, the company offers a range of generic drugs, and the number of therapeutic areas has grown from two to six. in the last two years, arogya Parivar developed and launched six products to create a pool of affordable medicines, with products relevant to the market, such as the painkiller Natarid \u00ae. this unique social business model of combining health educators with a sales force has proved successful in serving more patients. t hese educators are often drawn from the villages themselves and in every sense of the phrase, speak the language of the people they address. they also work closely with village leaders, anganwadi workers and asHas (accredited social Health activists); india has as many as 900,000 asHas. arogya Parivar empowers villagers, provides employment, and enhances rural healthcare, encouraging people like shankar Lal to participate in the program and claim a sense of ownership. shankar Lal, whose health improved after he was diagnosed with low bone density at an arogya Parivar camp, now feels it is his responsibility to spread the news to others. He willingly takes time out of tending to his oats farm, going around villages beating a duggi to announce health education camps, as it was on april 7, 1932, that Us President franklin d. roosevelt first used the term in his radio address, The Forgotten Man. He said: \"these unhappy times call for the building of plans that rest upon the forgotten, the unorganized but the indispensable units of economic power . . . that build from the bottom up and not from the top down, that put their faith once more in the forgotten man at the bottom of the economic pyramid.\" in 1998, late c.K. Prahalad proposed, along with stuart L. Hart, that businesses, governments and donor agencies should stop thinking of the poor as victims and instead be responsive to their needs, recognising them as creative, resilient and value- demanding consumers. Prahalad subsequently expanded on the concept in his book, The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid.Bottom of the pyramid11NoV artis iNdia LiMited annual report 2018 - 2019children follow enthusiastically, dancing to the beat. shankar Lal is delighted when the children follow him, because then they go back and spread the word to their parents. this model, which is possible to replicate, has proved so effective that Novartis has adapted it in other countries as well, such as Kenya and Vietnam. Vietnam adapted it in 2013 and became self-sustaining in 2015 while Kenya, which began in 2013, broke even at the end of 2017. arogya Parivar has also been consistently recognized in global rankings and awards, such as the GBc Health Business action on Health award and award for social Marketing from the cMo asia awards. it was named best long-term rural marketing initiative by the rural Marketing association of india, india's largest industry association. REACHING OUT When Novartis first decided to translate its vision for social business into arogya Parivar, the company set up cells in rural areas, within a radius of about 35 kilometers - a distance on dirt roads that could be covered with a light motorcycle in a day. each cell would include some 10 market towns and dozens of tiny villages, with a cell supervisor in charge. Novartis recruited health educators from these regions - people who had social equity and community acceptance among the villagers. the health educators received rigorous training, both on the field and in formal settings, before going out to speak to the largely illiterate population about malnutrition, iron deficiency, and women's health, among other things. With many health subjects often being stigmatized, particularly in the case of women, the health educators needed to be not just knowledgeable but also sensitive to local sensibilities. also, while generating awareness, at no point would they discuss Novartis products or market its medicines and treatments. Lighting the fire A former tobacco farmer takes to spreading messages of health awareness Kamlesh is a familiar and welcome visitor to impoverished villagers who live near Bhadkad, a village in sojitra taluka in the anand district. once a tobacco farmer, he realized that he should do something to help the community instead. Now recognized as one of arogya Parivar's most motivated and successful health educators, he spends his time spreading awareness of good health and recruiting other men and women to join him in the crusade. Kamlesh believes deeply in upliftment of the masses and good hygiene and arogya Parivar has given him a platform. it has also boosted his own confidence in public speaking. The proactive approach Kanchanben, who sought help through Arogya Parivar, now encourages other people to act in time for better health When Kanchanben, a resident of the village Kheda near ahmedabad in Gujarat, began experiencing dizzy spells and general weakness, she had no idea what was happening but knew she could not ignore it. she met health educator Kamlesh of arogya Parivar and told him about the problem. He asked her to attend the next health camp, where the onsite doctor realised she had a low blood cell count. He referred Kanchanben to a local clinic for tests, and as her health improved, she decided to pay it forward. Kanchanben became an asHa worker, dividing her time between looking after her home and spreading messages to create greater health awareness. she also visits people's homes to encourage them to go to the camps. Kanchanben, who averted a personal health crisis by being proactive, recognizes that other women need to do the same. 12NoV artis iNdia LiMited annual report 2018 - 2019cell supervisors, however, did connect with registered pharmacists and distributors to ensure that stocks of medicines were always available, and with doctors, to check on compliance. in reaching out to these people, Novartis often worked with non-governmental organizations (NGos) and with asHas. the cell supervisor was responsible for sales of Novartis products. The Six 'A's the four pillars - or '4as' - on which the program has been built are awareness, accessibility, affordability and adaptability. Now, in the next phase of its evolution, two new ' a's have been added; these are adherence and alliances. Awareness: Health education is the first step towards informing communities about prevention of diseases and the importance of personal care. these meetings, which tackle basic issues such as hygiene, nutrition, and common medical conditions, go a long way towards increasing awareness; in the process, though indirectly, they also create a larger customer base for the company, reaching out to people who can afford to buy medicines, but lack awareness. Novartis uses well-defined 'stories', including for children with comic- book formats as a medium, to drive messages such as safe drinking water and the importance of washing one's hands. all 'stories' are delivered in the local language and in many instances in the local dialect. Accessibility: in remote regions of india, where transport and connectivity are a problem, and traveling to see a doctor involves both huge expenses, and often, a day's wages lost, it is vital to ensure consistent availability of medicines and healthcare. arogya Parivar's wide network of qualified doctors and pharmacies in these regions ensure that villagers who may have never seen a doctor before now have access to screening, diagnosis, treatment, and preventive care - and are also able to buy the medicines they need. Affordability: the arogya Parivar portfolio of medicines meets the affordability needs of rural markets, through its range of products and packaging that is in a price range that villagers can afford. in addition, minimizing their travel costs by providing these medicines far closer to home ensures that expenses are further reduced; the travel cost can often be more than the actual treatment. Adaptability: in reaching out to last-mile target groups, it is vital for health educators to adapt the program to local needs, and communicate with people within the framework of the culture and dialect that they can relate to. this fundamental connection with the ethos of the specific area is a must-have qualification, which is why health educators are recruited from among the populations that they serve. training of these health educators and supervisors is also adapted to local conditions, and products are tailored to the local disease burden. into this mix of 4 'a's, two new ones - adherence and alliances - strengthen the initiative and drive the movement forward. Adherence: Low levels of health literacy and out-of-pocket cost of drugs often result in poor adherence rates for treatment in developing countries. While educators at the health camps stress the importance of following treatment through, patients often stop taking the medicines. it is important, Model achieved breakeven in 30 monthsPatients participating in health campsPresent in 15 states covering >15,000 villages Health educators create awareness on key health topicsattended health education meetingsLook at the numbers today13NoV artis iNdia LiMited annual report 2018 - 2019therefore, to ensure that they adhere to the treatment suggested to obtain the full benefits. Alliances: Given the scale and complexity of the challenges involved, which differ from region to region, no one organization can prove completely effective working alone. With a population of 1.37 billion, of whom 21.9% are below poverty line, alliances with NGos and other partners are essential; while these agencies can leverage the work they are doing, Novartis can help extend it across the vast geographies in which it operates. While Novartis has always recognized the importance of teamwork, it is ramping up efforts to communicate with a variety of partners, including local agencies, and those with specialized expertise, such as with digital technology. WHAT NEXT? Healthcare for the Urban Poor: With 10 years of successful operations behind it, arogya Parivar is now in expansionist mode. While the number of districts and states in which it operates is growing, and infrastructure is being created to keep pace, the team behind this rural-based program is also looking at new areas, including urban slums. often, because the rate of migration from villages is so high, these are the same people it would have targeted in remote regions. Generally, villagers who migrate do not always come directly into mega-cities; they would first go to towns closer to their homes. Nizamabad in telangana, for instance, 159 km away from Hyderabad by road, has > 900 villages in the vicinity; this town is a popular destination for rural migrants. arogya Parivar also has a program up and running in Jigani, 26 km from Bengaluru; they had conducted a pilot in partnership with apparel company Levi's and its supplier aquarelle, reaching out to more than 8,000 workers, mostly women. the arogya Parivar team found that more than 16% of the women were anaemic. arogya Parivar health workers trained factory novartis india limited annual report 2018 - 201914 novartis india limited annual report 2018 - 201915 workers and supervisors to serve as peer health educators so that they could deliver basic health-related information to their co-workers in biweekly sessions, supporting the nurse and physician who provided healthcare services on the factory premises. arogya Parivar's intervention on this, and other issues such as menstrual hygiene, has visibly reduced attrition levels and improved qualitative attendance. Digital Platforms: as technology increasingly helps in bringing healthcare to remote regions, Novartis has recognized that it can play a major role in meeting the objectives of arogya Parivar. Most community Health centres (cHcs) are at a distance of 25km, and around 13% Primary Health centers (PHcs) and 11% cHcs are more than 50km away from the district Hospital. 16% PHcs do not have an MBBs doctor. in such a situation, access to healthcare is a dim possibility for people living in remote regions. on the bright side, mobile phone usage and internet connectivity are on the rise; according to one 2017 report, mobile phone penetration was expected to rise from 65% - 75% to 85% - 90% by 2020. this offers tremendous scope for the growth of telemedicine in the country - a tool that the indian government began working on since the year 2000 in its efforts to improve healthcare access. telemedicine is also useful when the number of doctors dwindles during certain months of the year; in summer, doctors in the 33,000-strong arogya Parivar network are not always available. arogya Parivar has set up a telemedicine pilot in partnership with tech Mahindra in chandauli, Uttar Pradesh. Here, qualified nurses check the health parameters of patients, who then have access to an online medical consultation with a medical team at a hospital in Varanasi. this leads to saving on out-of-pocket expenses and better utilization of funds for treatment. if patients need further diagnosis, they are recommended a visit to the hospital, where for a nominal fee, they get diagnosed by a doctor and receive up to three medicines free. those who require tertiary care are referred to a government hospital in Varanasi. arogya Parivar is also in the process of piloting two new digital initiatives in order to improve health education and measure the impact of health education and screening camps. AT A VANTAGE POINT thanks to the excellent track record that arogya Parivar has built up in the 11 years of its existence, the program has visibility. \"Beyond being a Harvard Business school case study, we are at a vantage point to see what opportunities are available,\" says Lokesh Manikonda. \"We have more than 15 organisations, some of them large global ones, who are keen to collaborate with us. several state governments would also like to leverage our work.\" arogya Parivar is a rare example of an innovative solution that originated in india and is now being replicated in other countries. as the alliance for Health Policy and systems research flagship report 2014 explains, quoting Professor Muhammad Yunus, 2006 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, there are two extreme types of business models - financial profit-maximizing businesses seeking to create shareholder value and not- for-profit organizations seeking to maximize social profit. Neither of these is enough to address global concerns. social businesses, on the other hand, apply rules from both models. they seek to maximize social profit, but must make financial profit to cover their full costs and return investment to their owners. a social business, in Professor Yunus' definition, is \"a self-sustaining company that sells goods or services and repays its owners' investments, but whose primary purpose is to serve society and improve the lot of the poor.\" it is a principle that arogya Parivar has understood well, as millions of happy families in india would agree. arogya Parivar is also in the process of piloting two new digital initiatives in order to improve health education and measure the impact of health education and screening camps novartis india limited annual report 2018 - 201916Notice NOTICE is hereby given that the 71st Annual General Meeting of NOVARTIS INDIA LIMITED will be held at Mumbai Cricket Association [MCA] Banquet Hall, Ground Floor, G Block BKC, RG - 2, Bandra (E), Mumbai 400 051 on Friday, August 09, 2019 at 11:30 a.m. to transact the following business: Ordinary Business 1.

The Board continues to support a steady dividend policy and the recommended dividend is in accordance with the Dividend Distribution Policy of the Company. A copy of the said Policy is available on the website of the Company at www.novartis.in Management Discussion and Analysis For the year under review, the business operations of the Company comprises Pharmaceuticals. a. Economy, Industry and developments India's economic growth in terms of GDP , for Financial Year 2018-19 has averaged around 6.8 percent, primarily due a decline in the growth of private consumption, tepid increase in fixed investment, slowdown of growth in agriculture and muted exports. However, harmonization of structural reforms such as the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and bank recapitalization, controlled inflation rate, cuts in repo rate and easing of bank liquidity have attempted to provide a fillip to the economic growth. According to the World Bank, India will continue to be the fastest growing economy in the world. A new Government at the centre is expected to continue to prioritize welfare programs, such as those aimed at providing support to farmers, improving housing conditions and expanding access to healthcare. Inspite of being the fastest growing major economy, India's healthcare system currently remains inadequate to provide care to a population of 1.3 billion, especially in rural areas. While the Government has set ambitious targets under the National Health Policy (NHP) for improving healthcare standards, the progress is expected to be gradual and may take years for significant headway to be achieved. The NHP 2017 calls for an increase in the government's contribution to healthcare spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2025, which is encouraging to note. novartis india limited annual report 2018 - 201924 The Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY), the national health protection scheme under 'Ayushman Bharat', was launched in September 2018. Once fully implemented, PMJAY is expected to provide health insurance coverage for secondary and tertiary care to 500 million poor and vulnerable people thereby expanding healthcare reach of the country. The proposed e-pharmacy regulation, if implemented properly, could boost growth for the industry by streamlining the supply chain. The Indian Pharma Market (\"IPM\") is forecast to grow at a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 10.2%* (+/- 3.0%) over the next four years to reach ` 2255.5 billion by 2023. However it continues to be a highly fragmented and a competitive market with a large number of players spread across therapeutic segments. b. Performance Revenue from operations for the year ended March 31, 2019 was ` 4,906.8 million representing a decrease of 13.0% over the previous year. Profit before tax for the year stood at ` 857.7 million representing a decrease of 45.5% over the previous year. This is mainly on account of extraordinary interest income of ` 981.3 million received on income tax refund of Assessment Year (AY) 1995-96 during the financial year 2017-18. c. Segment-wise operational performance The Pharmaceuticals business registered Net Revenue from Operations of ` 4,906.8 million representing a decrease of 13.0% over the previous year. Some of the factors that impacted results for the year under review include, issuance of notices by the Drugs Licensing Authority, Daman, to a supplier of Company's product (viz., Voveran \u00ae 1ml) and consequently the Company suspending the sale of that product in the market. The supplier has contested the notices and presently the matter is sub judice before the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi. However, with the launch of Voveran maxxgel and a new variant of Voveran\u00ae 1ml, the Company expects to further strengthen its position by serving more patients. In addition to the above, supply constraints pertaining to a few products sourced from Contract manufacturing also impacted the Company's revenue during year under review. To mitigate the impact of decline in revenue, cost containment measures were undertaken by the Company during the year to protect its operating profits. The following brands hold key positions in major therapeutic areas such as: Therapeutic Area Product Central Nervous System Tegrital\u00ae Pain & Inflammation Voveran\u00ae Transplantation/Immunology Sandimmun\u00ae Neoral\u00ae d. Key Financial Indicators Particulars 2018-19 2017-18 Operating profit margin (%) 1.9 -1.6 Net profit margin (%) 10.6 13.9 Debtors turnover ratio 11.0 13.3 Current ratio 4.4 2.9 Return on Net Worth 6.8 10.7 Inventory turnover ratio 8.4 7.8 Interest coverage ratio NA NA Debt equity ratio NA NA * Source: IQVIA MARKET PROGNOSIS 2019-2023 Asia/Australia - India. Published March 201925 novartis india limited annual report 2018 - 2019 Reasons for change compared to the previous financial year in some of the key financial ratios is as follows: Operating profit margin Operating profit margin is a profitability or performance ratio used to calculate the percentage of profit a company produces from its operations. It is calculated by dividing the operating earnings before interest and tax by turnover. The Company's efforts to lower employee, material and other costs during the Financial Year (FY) 2018-19 has resulted in improvement of operating profit margin as compared to FY 2017-18. Net profit margin The net profit margin is equal to how much net income or profit is generated as a percentage of revenue. It is calculated by dividing profit for the year by turnover. Net profit margin in FY 2018-19 is lower compared to FY 2017-18, as one-off Interest income on Income Tax refund for AY 1995-96 of INR 981.3 million was received in FY 2017-18. Debtors turnover ratio It is calculated by dividing turnover by average trade receivables, to quantify a company's effectiveness in collecting its receivables. Since the Company had higher debtors as at March 31, 2019, it led to lower turnover ratio. Current ratio The Current Ratio is a liquidity ratio that measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations or those due within one year. It is calculated by dividing the current assets by current liabilities. Since the Company had lower 'other financial liabilities' as at March 31, 2019 it led to higher current ratio. Return on Net Worth Return on Net Worth is a measure of profitability of a company expressed in percentage. It is calculated by dividing profit for the year by total equity. Return on net worth in FY 2018-19 is lower compared to FY 2017-18, as one-off Interest income on Income Tax refund pertaining to AY 1995-96 of INR 981.3 was received in FY 2017-18. Inventory turnover ratio Inventory turnover is the number of times a company sells and replaces its inventory during a period. It is calculated by dividing turnover by average inventory. Lower inventory in FY 2018-19 led to higher turnover ratio. Interest coverage ratio The interest coverage ratio measures how many times a company can cover its current interest payment with its available earnings. It is calculated by dividing profit before interest and tax by finance cost. The Company does not have any debts as at March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018, and hence this ratio is not given in the table. Debt equity ratio The ratio is used to evaluate a company's financial leverage. It is a measure of the degree to which a Company is financing its operations through debt versus wholly owned funds. The Company does not have any debts as at March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018, and hence this ratio is not given in the table. e. Risks Healthcare insurance in India is yet to make a positive impact on affordability. (Control of prices of certain drugs under the DPCO continues to affect the profitability of the pharmaceutical industry). Revision of the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM) could result in expansion of price controls under the DPCO, which would put further downward pressure on drug prices.novartis india limited annual report 2018 - 201926 The Indian Pharma Market (IPM) is dominated by generic medicines and these drugs account for nearly 75% of the pharma industry. Prescription by generic names could also have an impact on pharma companies and it could necessitate a change in the Company's promotional strategies. Any proposal to cap trade margins on non-scheduled products at 10% for distribution and 20% for retail pharmacy would significantly impact the business model for trade generics. Novartis AG, which is the Company's holding company, owns directly or indirectly several companies in Novartis Group worldwide including various brands and patents. Therefore, any merger, acquisition, divestment or restructuring by Novartis AG or its subsidiaries, would have an influence on the Company's operations in India as well. f. Outlook A stable new Government at the centre is likely to continue to prioritise welfare programs, such as those aimed at providing support to farmers, improving housing conditions and expanding access to healthcare. However, the effectiveness of such programs may be undermined by problems in their implementation, as well as funding shortfalls. The NHP 2017 calls for an increase in the Government's contribution to healthcare spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2025; implementation of PMJAY should help achieve this objective, but the target is unlikely to be realized by 2025. Inflation is projected to rise somewhat above the midpoint of the Reserve Bank of India's target range of 2 to 6 per cent, mainly owing to energy and food prices. However, private consumption is projected to remain robust and investment growth is expected to continue as the benefits of new policy reforms begin to materialize. While the overall outlook for the economy looks promising, it is also dependent upon many macro-economic factors like increasing crude oil prices, commodity inflation, potential disruptions due to global events, problem of non-performing assets, a below normal monsoon which could have a dampening effect on GDP growth in future. g. Internal control systems and their adequacy The Company maintains appropriate systems of internal control, including monitoring procedures, to ensure that all assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposal. Company policies, guidelines and procedures provide for adequate checks and balances and are meant to ensure that all transactions are authorized, recorded and reported correctly. The Head of Internal Audit together with external audit consultants reviews the effectiveness and efficiency of these systems and procedures to ensure that all assets are protected against loss and that the financial and operational information is accurate and complete in all respects. The Audit Committee approves and reviews audit plans for the year based on internal risk assessment. Audits are conducted on an ongoing basis and significant deviations are brought to the notice of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors following which corrective action is recommended for implementation. All these measures facilitate timely detection of any irregularities and early remedial steps. During the year, the Company conducted a detailed review of its internal control systems, evaluated the internal financial control systems with the Audit Committee and discussed relevant issues with internal and statutory auditors. Based on the recommendations of the Audit Committee, the Board has stated in its responsibility statement that the Company followed proper internal financial controls and that such internal financial controls are adequate and were operating effectively.27 novartis india limited annual report 2018 - 2019h. Vigil Mechanism The Company has established a Vigil Mechanism and Whistleblower policy that enables the Directors and employees to report genuine concerns. The said Policy provides for (a) adequate safeguards against victimization of persons who use the Vigil Mechanism; and (b) direct access to the Chairperson of the Audit Committee of the Board of the Company in appropriate or exceptional cases.

These workshops act as a platform for sharing best practices and different things happening across the network of schools. They also work on curriculum development in these schools.

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (\"the Act\") in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended, (\"Ind AS\") and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at 31 st March, 2019, and its profit, total comprehensive income, its cash flows and the changes in equity for the year ended on that date. Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit of the financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act (SAs). Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI's Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the financial statements. Key Audit Matter Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matter described below to be the key audit matter to be communicated in our report. Key Audit Matter Auditor's Response Revenue recognition - Sale of products [Note 1(J) to the financial statements] The nature of operations of the Company being driven by trading activities, the focus of internal reporting as well as of external stakeholders is on revenue which could be a causal factor to record revenues for sales that either did not occur, or for which the revenue recognition criteria may not have been met. This risk is furthered considering that the Company sells its products across the country through wide spread distribution points. We have therefore specifically focused on the said risk and have considered this to be a key audit matter.Assessed the appropriateness of the Company's revenue recognition policies by mapping them with the applicable accounting standards. Performed a walkthrough of the revenue business cycle to gain an understanding of the relevant risks and controls around occurrence and timing of revenue recognition. We also tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of the relevant controls. Tested transactions on a sample basis by, agreeing sales with the invoices, purchase orders and delivery documents, comparing the invoice prices to the Company price lists, agreeing the revenue amount recorded by management to underlying accounting records. We also reviewed the contracts / purchase orders, as applicable, to assess the terms of sale and confirmed that the sales were recorded in the correct accounting period. novartis india limited annual report 2018 - 201974Key Audit Matter Auditor's Response We sought confirmations from customers on a test check basis and checked realisation / performed other alternate procedures, where applicable, to support the assertion that revenue has been recognised for sales that has occurred during the year. We made enquiries of the management and obtained written representations as to whether there exist any side agreements or unusual arrangements which may impact revenue recognition. We also reviewed variations in revenue over the corresponding period, checked subsequent sales returns and tested any unusual transactions to determine whether the information corroborates with the revenue recorded in the books of account. Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor's Report Thereon The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Business Responsibility Report, Directors' report including annexures to the Directors' Report and Report on Corporate Governance, but does not include the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance including other comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company in accordance with the Ind AS and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Those Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process. Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit of the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 75 novartis india limited annual report 2018 - 2019but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls system in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management. Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the financial statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the financial statements. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.novartis india limited annual report 2018 - 201976Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements 1.

For Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP Chartered Accountants (Firm's Registration No. 117366W/W-100018) Rakesh N. Sharma Partner (Membership No. 102042) Place : Mumbai Date : 23 rd May, 201977 novartis india limited annual report 2018 - 2019Annexure \"A\" to the Independent Auditor's Report (Referred to in paragraph 1(f) under 'Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements' section of our report of even date to the Members of Novartis India Limited on the financial statements for the year ended 31st March, 2019) Report on the Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (\"the Act\") We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of Novartis India Limited (\"the Company\") as of 31st March, 2019 in conjunction with our audit of the financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date. Management's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act. Auditor's Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls over financial reporting of the Company based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the \"Guidance Note\") issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the Standards on Auditing prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting were established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects. Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company's internal financial controls system over financial reporting. Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting A company's internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to novartis india limited annual report 2018 - 201978permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Opinion In our opinion, to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the Company has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system over financial reporting and such internal financial controls over financial reporting were operating effectively as at 31 st March, 2019, based on the criteria for internal financial control over financial reporting established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

In terms of our report of even date For and on behalf of the Board For Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP Christopher Snook Firm Registration No. 117366W/W-100018 Chairman Noble Time Director & Chief Financial OfficerDIN: 03086192 Mumbai, 23 rd May 2019 Mumbai, 23rd May 201985 novartis india limited annual report 2018 - 2019Corporate Information Novartis India Limited (\"the Company\") is a public limited company listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange, incorporated and domiciled in India and has its registered office at Inspire - BKC, Part of 601 and 701, Bandra Kurla Complex, Bandra East, Mumbai 400051, India. It is primarily engaged in the business of trading of Drugs and Pharmaceuticals. These financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 23 rd May, 2019. 1. Significant Accounting Policies The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. A. Basis of Preparation (i) Compliance with Ind AS These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (referred to as \"Ind AS\") notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 as amended. (ii) Historical Cost Convention The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments that are measured at fair values at the end of each reporting period as explained in the accounting policies below. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration in exchange of goods and services. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data is available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. For financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2, or 3 based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows: Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. (iii) Operating Cycle Based on the nature of products and the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and cash equivalents, the Company has ascertained its operating cycle as 12 months for the purpose of current / non-current classification of assets and liabilities. B. Foreign Currency Translation (i) Functional and Presentation Currency Items included in the financial statements of the Company are recognised using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates ('the functional currency'). The financial statements are presented in 'Indian Rupees' (`), which is Company's functional and presentation currency. (ii) Transactions and Balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.Notes forming part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March 2019novartis india limited annual report 2018 - 201986 C. Property, Plant and Equipment Items of Property, Plant and Equipment are stated in the balance sheet at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment loss, if any. The historical cost of Property, Plant and Equipment comprises of its purchase price and cost directly attributable to bringing the assets to their working condition for their intended use. Capital Work-in-Progress represents Property, Plant and Equipment that are not ready for their intended use as at the balance sheet date. Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Property, Plant and Equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Transition to Ind AS: On transition to Ind AS, the Company elected to continue with the carrying value of all of its Property, Plant and Equipment recognised as at 1 st April, 2015 (\"transition date\") measured as per the previous GAAP and use that carrying value as its deemed cost as of the transition date. Depreciation: The Company depreciates its Property, Plant and Equipment using Straight Line Method (SLM) over their estimated useful lives as prescribed under Part C of Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 (the \"Act\") except as stated below. The estimated useful lives of the assets are as follows: Description Estimated Useful Lives Buildings 60 years Plant and Equipments# 3 years to 12.5 years Furniture Fixtures 10 years Vehicles# 5 years Office Equipments 5 years # Based on technical evaluation, the management believes that the useful lives as given above best represent the period over which the management expects to use these assets. Hence the useful lives for these assets is different from the useful lives as prescribed under Part C of schedule II of the Act. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the period of the lease agreement or the useful life, whichever is shorter. Mobile Handsets and Mobile Devices are fully depreciated in the year of purchase. Estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods are reviewed periodically, including at each financial year end, taking into account commercial and technological obsolescence as well as normal wear and tear and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. Gains or losses arising from disposal of Property, Plant and Equipment are determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the profit or loss. D. Impairment of Non-Financial Assets Assets that are subject to depreciation or amortisation are tested at each balance sheet date for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset's or cash generating unit's (CGU) carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount and is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risk specific to the asset for which the estimates of the future cash flows have not been adjusted. When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or the CGU is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or CGU in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.Notes forming part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March 201987 novartis india limited annual report 2018 - 2019 E. Inventories Inventories are stated at lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on moving weighted average basis. Cost of inventory comprises cost of purchase and other cost incurred in bringing the goods to their present condition and location. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. F. Non-Current Assets Held for Sale Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use, the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition and a sale is considered highly probable. They are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Non-current assets are not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held for sale and are measured at lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell. Non-current assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately from the other assets and liabilities in the balance sheet. G. Trade Receivables Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for sale of goods or services performed in the ordinary course of business. Trade receivables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost less provision for impairment by applying the expected credit loss method. H. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cheques on hand, demand deposits with banks and other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. I. Financial Instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments. Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in profit or loss. Financial Assets The Company classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories: those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through other comprehensive income, or through profit or loss), and those measured at amortised cost. The classification depends on the entity's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows. Amortised Cost: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. A gain or loss on a financial asset that is subsequently measured at amortised cost is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised or impaired. Interest income from these financial assets is included in other income using the effective interest rate method. The Company does not have financial assets that are subsequently measured either at fair value through other comprehensive income or at fair value through profit or loss. Impairment of Financial Assets: The Company applies the expected credit loss model for recognising impairment loss on its financial assets. Notes forming part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March 2019novartis india limited annual report 2018 - 201988 The Company measures the loss allowance for a financial instruments at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk on that financial instruments has increased significantly since initial recognition. If credit risk on financial instruments has not increased significantly since initial recognition, the Company measures the loss allowance for that financial instrument that an amount equal to 12 months expected credit losses. For trade receivables, the Company always measures the loss allowance at an amount equal to life time expected credit losses. Further for the purpose of measuring life time expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables the Company has used practical expedient as permitted under Ind AS 109. The expected credit loss allowance is computed based on provision matrix which takes into the account historical credit loss experience and adjusted for forward looking information. Derecognition of Financial Assets: The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another party. If the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Company recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Company retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Company continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received. On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received / receivable is recognised in profit or loss. Financial Liabilities All financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using effective interest method. The interest expense is included in finance cost line item. The Company derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Company's obligations are discharged, cancelled or have expired. J. Revenue Recognition Revenue from contract with customers is recognised when the Company satisfies performance obligation by transferring promised goods and services to the customer. The revenue is measured based on transaction price, which is the fair value of consideration received or receivable, and is net of discounts, allowances, returns, goods and services tax/value added taxes/sales tax and amounts collected on behalf of third party. Provision is made for the non-sellable returns of goods from the customers estimated on the basis of historical data of sales return trends with respect to the shelf life of various products. Such provision for non-sellable sales returns is reduced from sale of products for the year. Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method. Commission income is recognised in respect of sales made on behalf of consignor when the control in the goods is transferred to the buyer and is net of goods and services tax. Rental income from operating leases is generally recognised over the term of the relevant lease using straight line method. However where the rentals are structured solely to increase in line with expected general inflation to compensate for the Company's expected inflationary cost increases, such increases are recognised in the year in which such benefits accrue. K. Offsetting Financial Instruments Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company or the counterparty. L. Income Tax Income tax expense comprises current tax expense and the net change in the deferred tax asset and liability during the year. Current and deferred taxes are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss, except to the extent that it relates to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.Notes forming part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March 201989 novartis india limited annual report 2018 - 2019 Current Tax The current tax charge for the year is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period as adjusted for taxes in respect of previous years. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns, including assessment orders received during the year, with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities. Deferred Tax Deferred tax is recognised, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. The carrying amount of deferred tax asset is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the assets to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. M. Employee Benefits (i) Short-Term Employee Benefits Liabilities for wages and salaries that are expected to be settled wholly within 12 months after the end of the annual reporting period in which the employees render the related service are recognised and measured at the undiscounted amount expected to be paid in exchange for the related service. (ii) Other Long-term Employee Benefit Obligations The employees of the Company are entitled to other long-term benefits in the form of Long Service Awards as per the policy of the Company and Leave encashment. Liability for such benefits is provided on the basis of valuation, as at the Balance Sheet date, carried out by an independent actuary. The actuarial valuation method used by the independent actuary for measuring the liabilities is the projected unit credit method. (iii) Post-Employment Obligations The Company has the following post-employment schemes: a) Defined benefit plans such as Provident Fund, Gratuity, Non-Contractual Pension Plan and Post Retirement Medical Benefits. b) Defined contribution plans such as Superannuation Fund and Employees' Pension Scheme. Defined Benefit Plans The Company has Defined Benefit Plans for post employment benefits in the form of Provident Fund, Gratuity, Non-Contractual Pension Plan and Post Retirement Medical Benefits. Provident Fund and Gratuity fund are recognised by the Income-tax authorities and administered through trustees and/or Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC). Liability for Defined Benefit Plans is provided on the basis of valuations, as at the Balance Sheet date, carried out by an independent actuary. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using discount rate (interest rates of government bond) that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related Provident Fund, Gratuity, Non-contractual Pension Plan and Post Retirement Medical Benefits liabilities.Notes forming part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March 2019novartis india limited annual report 2018 - 201990 Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments, changes in actuarial assumptions and the return on plan assets (excluding net interest) are recognised in the period in which they occur, directly in other comprehensive income. They are included in retained earnings in the statement of changes in equity and in the balance sheet. Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. Defined Contribution Plan The Company has Defined Contribution Plans for post-employment benefits in the form of Superannuation Fund and Employees' Pension Scheme which are recognised by the Income-tax authorities and administered through trustees and/or LIC. Superannuation Fund which constitutes an insured benefit and Employees' Pension Scheme are classified as Defined Contribution Plans as the Company has no further obligation beyond making the contributions. The Company's contributions to Defined Contribution Plans are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss as incurred. (iv) Termination Benefits Termination benefits are recognised as an expense as and when incurred. (v) Share-Based Payments The Company offers its employees, share based payments in the form of a \"Select\" plan. The Equity Plan \"Select\" is a global equity incentive plan for eligible employees. This plan allows its participants to choose the form of their equity compensation in \"Restricted Shares\" or \"Tradable Shares\" of the ultimate holding Company, Novartis AG, Basel. Unvested restricted shares are only conditional on the provision of services by the plan participant during the vesting period. They are valued using their fair value (market price of traded stocks of Novartis AG) on the grant date. The fair value of these grants are expensed on a straight-line basis over the respective vesting period. The total expense (adjusted for estimated forfeitures) is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At each reporting date, the Company revises its estimates of the number of shares that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions. It recognizes the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the Statement of Profit and Loss with a corresponding adjustment to equity. Group Company recharges to the Company for the share based payments made/to be made by them to the Company's employees and the payment is adjusted against the Share Options Outstanding Account by the Company. (vi) Bonus Plans The Company recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses. The Company recognises a provision where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation. N. Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets (i) Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount has been reliably estimated. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. (ii) Contingent Liabilities Contingent liabilities are disclosed, unless the possibility of outflow of resources is remote, when there is: - A possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company or - A present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made. (iii) Contingent Assets A contingent asset is disclosed, where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.Notes forming part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March 201991 novartis india limited annual report 2018 - 2019 O. Segment Reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments and makes strategic decisions (Refer Note 32). P. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing the profit or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. The weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year and for all years presented is adjusted for events, other than the conversion of potential equity shares that have changed the number of equity shares outstanding, without a corresponding change in resources. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the profit or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders of the Company and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year is adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares. Q. Leases As a lessee: Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Incremental payments structured to increase in line with expected general inflation to compensate for the lessor's expected inflationary cost increases are not considered for straight lining. R. Dividends Provision is made for the amount of any dividend declared, being appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion of the entity, on or before the end of the reporting period but not distributed at the end of the reporting period. S. Contributed equity Equity shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, from the proceeds. T. Rounding of amounts All amounts disclosed in the financial statements and notes have been rounded off to the nearest million with one decimal thereof as per the requirement of Schedule III, unless otherwise stated. U. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Standards issued but not yet effective Ind AS 116, Leases: The Ministry of Corporate Affairs ('MCA') has notified the Ind AS 116, Leases which will be effective from 1 st April, 2019. Ind AS 116 would replace the existing leases standard Ind AS 17. The standard sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosures in relation to lease contracts and requires a lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value. Currently, operating lease expenses are charged to the statement of profit and loss. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of the above in the financial statements. Amendment to Ind AS 12 'Income Taxes': On 30 th March, 2019, the MCA has notified limited amendments to Ind AS 12 'Income Taxes'. The amendments require an entity to recognise the income tax consequences of dividends as defined in Ind AS 109 when it recognises a liability to pay a dividend. The income tax consequences of dividends are linked more directly to past transactions or events that generated distributable profits than to distributions to owners. Therefore, an entity shall recognize the income tax consequences of dividends in profit or loss, other comprehensive income or equity according to where the entity originally recognised those past transactions or events. The amendment will come into force for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 st April, 2019. The Company is evaluating the effect of the above in the financial statements.Notes forming part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March 2019novartis india limited annual report 2018 - 201992 Appendix C to Ind AS 12, Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments: On 30th March, 2019, the MCA has notified the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2019 containing Appendix C to Ind AS 12, Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments which clarifies the application and measurement requirements in Ind AS 12 when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments. The current and deferred tax asset or liability shall be recognized and measured by applying the requirements in Ind AS 12 based on the taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates determined by applying this appendix. The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 st April, 2019. The Company is evaluating the effect of the above in the financial statements. Amendment to Ind AS 19 'Employee Benefits': On March 30, 2019, the MCA has notified limited amendments to Ind AS 19 'Employee Benefits' in connection with accounting for plan amendments, curtailments and settlements. The amendments require an entity to use updated assumptions to determine current service cost and net interest for the remainder of the period after a plan amendment, curtailment or settlement and to recognise in profit or loss as part of past service cost, or a gain or loss on settlement, any reduction in a surplus, even if that surplus was not previously recognised because of the impact of the asset ceiling. The amendment will come into force for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 st April, 2019. The Company is evaluating the effect of the above in the financial statements. V. Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements Preparing the financial statements under Ind AS requires management to take decisions and make estimates and assumptions that may impact the value of revenues, costs, assets and liabilities and the related disclosures concerning the items involved as well as contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revision to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. The following are the areas involving critical estimates and judgements as at the end of the reporting period that may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year: Estimation of Defined Benefit Obligation [Refer Note 14(a)] Estimation of Provision and Contingent Liabilities [Refer Note 27 (A) and 37] Estimation of useful life of Property, Plant and Equipment [Refer Note 1-C]Notes forming part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March 201993 novartis india limited annual report 2018 - 2019Notes forming part of the Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31st March 2019 2.

In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the defined benefit liability recognised in the balance sheet.

If bond yields fall, the defined benefit obligation will tend to increase. Salary inflation risk \u2014 Higher than expected increased in salary will increase the defined benefit obligation.Demographic risk \u2014 This is the risk of variability of results due to unsystematic nature of decrements that include mortality, withdrawal, disability and retirement. The effect of these decrements on the defined benefit obligations is not straight forward and depends upon the combination of salary increase, discount rate and vesting criteria. It is important not to overstate withdrawals because in financial analysis the retirement benefit of the short career employee typically costs less per year as compared to a long service employee. Medical inflation risk \u2014 Higher than expected increase in premium will lead to increase in defined benefit obligations. Although the risk is mitigated by capping the benefit paid by insurance Company (limiting the premium amount for the Company). Investment return risk \u2014 Lower the expected investment return, higher will be the defined benefit obligation. in ` million 31st March 2019 31st March 2018 Major category of plan assets for all the defined benefit obligations are as followsAmount in % Amount in % Government Bonds 700.7 34.56% 611.7 30.58% Mutual Fund 40.4 Funds india limited annual report 2018 - 2019104Notes forming part of the Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31st March 2019 15.Other Non-Current Liabilities 31st March 2019 31st March 2018 in ` million in ` million Income Received in Advance 13.4 26.8 Total Other Non-Current Liabilities 13.4 26.8 16.Provisions 31st March 2019 31st March 2018 in ` million in ` million Provision for Non-sellable Sales Returns [Refer Note 7 and Note 28] 79.3 90.6 Provision for Contingencies [Refer Note 28] For Sales Tax matters 19.2 19.2 For Legal Case 22.9 21.3 Total Provisions 121.4 131.1 17.Current Tax Liabilities (Net) 31st March 2019 31st March 2018 in ` million in ` million Provision for tax [net of advance tax ` 1,822.1 million (As at 31st March, 2018 ` 1,510.9 million)] 87.4 66.9 Total Current Tax Liabilities (Net) 87.4 66.9 18.Other Current Liabilities 31st March 2019 31st March 2018 in ` million in ` million Income Received in Advance 13.2 13.2 Advances from Customers 14.4 9.4 Others \u2014 Statutory Dues (Contributions to PF , PT , Withholding Taxes etc.) 51.1 60.0 \u2014 Payable to Income tax Authorities (Refer Note 29) \u2014 370.0 Total Other Current Liabilities 78.7 452.6 19.Liabilities directly associated with assets classified as held for sale 31st March 2019 31st March 2018 in ` million in ` million Advance received against sale of certain asset out of assets held for sale (Refer Note 11) \u2014 10.5 Total Liabilities directly associated with assets classified as held for sale \u2014 10.5 105 novartis india limited annual report 2018 - 201920.

(a) The Company has filed a Writ Petition on 8th May, 2014 before the Hon'ble Delhi High Court challenging the move of the National Pharmaceuticals Pricing Authority (\"NPPA\") to include Voveran 50 GE Tablets, marketed by the Company, under price control in terms of the Drug Price Control Order 2013 (\"DPCO 2013\"). During the pendency of the Writ Petition the NPPA issued a Show Cause Notice dated 24 th September, 2014 to the Company alleging over charge on sales of Voveran 50 GE Tablets by the Company. The Company responded to the show cause notice vide its letters dated 13th October, 2014 and 27th October, 2014. The NPPA issued a Demand Notice dated 31st October, 2014 directing the Company to pay ` 281.8 million (including interest) by 15th November, 2014. This demand has been challenged by the Company before the Hon'ble Delhi High Court by way of miscellaneous applications followed by an amended writ petition. The Hon'ble Delhi High Court passed order restraining the NPPA from taking coercive steps in respect of the aforesaid demand. The matter is posted for further hearing on 15 th July, 2019. In the opinion of the Company, Voveran 50 GE Tablet is not covered under the category of essential medicines under the National List of Essential Medicines and, hence, is a non-scheduled drug under DPCO, 2013. Therefore, Voveran 50 GE Tablet cannot be brought under the regime of price control under Paragraph 14 of the DPCO, 2013. Accordingly, no provision is considered necessary at this stage. (b) During the year, the NPPA has issued a demand notice dated 20 th/25th June, 2018 of ` 134.4 million (including interest) on the Company alleging over charge on sales of Tegrital CR 200 by the Company. This demand has been challenged by the Company before the Hon'ble Delhi High Court by filing a Writ Petition on 27 th July, 2018 challenging the move of the NPPA to include Tegrital CR 200, marketed by the Company, under price control in terms of the DPCO 2013. The Hon'ble Delhi High Court has on 6 th August, 2018 passed an order directing the NPPA not to give effect to the aforesaid impugned demand notice. The matter is posted for further hearing on 15th July, 2019. In the opinion of the Company, the Price Revision Notification dated 28th April, 2014 would not apply to Tegrital CR 200 as it was not covered by the ambit of price notification in as much Tegrital CR 200 drug was not a \"scheduled formulation\" under DPCO 2013. When Tegrital CR became a scheduled formulation w.e.f. 10 th March, 2016, NPPA issued a separate Ceiling Price Notification on 29th March, 2016 for the said formulation, which amounts to admission on the part of NPPA that this formulation could be covered only by the subsequent Notification of 2016 and not by the prior Notification of 2014, on the basis whereof the impugned Demand has been raised by NPPA. Accordingly, no provision is considered necessary at this stage. 38. Fair value measurements Fair valuation techniques and inputs used (i) Fair Value Hierarchy This section explains the judgements and estimates made in determining the fair values of the financial instruments that are (a) recognised and measured at fair value and (b) measured at amortised cost and for which fair values are disclosed in the financial statements. Financial assets and liabilities at amortised cost, classified under Level 2 hier archy Particulars 31 st March 201931st March 2018 in ` million in ` million Financial assets Loan to Employees 7.0 8.2 Tender Deposits 5.5 2.6 Receivable from Related Parties 190.0 59.1 Receivable as Consignment Agent 127.8 159.4 Expenses Recoverable 4.6 17.6 Trade Receivables 455.9 439.1 Cash and Cash Equivalents 877.6 376.3 Unpaid Dividend Accounts 15.2 15.7 Deposits with banks 5,233.3 7,361.4 6,916.9 8,439.4 novartis india limited annual report 2018 - 2019118 Particulars 31st March 201931st March 2018 in ` million in ` million Financial liabilities Unpaid Dividends 15.2 15.7 Payable to Related Parties 425.5 1,349.0 Payables towards Purchase of Property, Plant and Equipment 0.4 13.4 Trade Payables 914.0 1,061.2 1,355.1 2,439.3 (ii) Valuation technique used to determine fair value Security deposits is classified as Level 3 category item under the fair value hierarchy based on the valuation technique used to calculate the Fair value. For the purpose of Fair valuation of Security Deposits the Company has used discounted cashflow method and considered discount rate of 9% being general bank borrowing rate prevalent in the market. Increase in the discount rate would result in decrease in the fair value and vice-versa. Fair value of Financial assets/financial liabilities, classified under Level 3 hierarchy Particulars 31 st March 201931st March 2018 in ` million in ` million Financial assets Other Financial assets Security Deposits 28.3 76.7 28.3 76.7 Financial liabilitiesOther Financial Liabilities Security Deposits 18.7 22.2 18.7 22.2 The amount of Fair value of Security deposits given and accepted is considered to be insignificant in value and hence carrying value and fair value is considered as same. The Company considers that the carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities recognised in the financial statements approximate their fair value. 39. Financial Risk Management The Company's activities expose it to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk. The Company's financial risk management is an integral part of how to plan and execute its business strategies. Market risk is the loss of future earnings, fair values or future cash flows that may result from the change of a price of a financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the foreign currency exchange rates and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable to all market risk sensitive financial instruments including foreign currency receivables and payables. The Company manages market risk through a treasury department, which evaluates and exercises independent control over the entire process of market risk management. The activities of this department include management of cash resources & ensuring compliance with market risk limits and policies. (A) Credit Risk The Company is exposed to credit risk, which is the risk that counterparty will default on its contractual obligation resulting in a financial loss to the company. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, deposits with banks, as well as credit exposures to customers including outstanding receivables. (i) Credit Risk Management Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counter-party fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company's receivables from customers.Notes forming part of the Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31st March 2019119 novartis india limited annual report 2018 - 2019Notes forming part of the Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31st March 2019 (ii) Trade and other receivables Credit risk arises from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed. The Company manages credit risk through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business. At 31 st March, 2019, the Company had 3 customers (At 31st March, 2018 : 5 customers) that owed the Company more than ` 10 million each and accounted for approximately 13% (At 31 st March, 2018 : 17%) of all the trade receivables, excluding related parties. In furtherance to above, the Company has assessed the impact of the simplified approach permitted by Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised in respect of trade receivables. Historical trends of impairment of trade receivables do not reflect any significant credit losses. Given that the macro economic indicators affecting customers of the Company have not undergone any substantial change, the Company expects the historical trend of minimal credit losses to continue. (iii) Movement in expected credit loss allowance Particulars in ` million As at 1st April 2017 48.6 Movement in expected credit loss allowance on trade receivables calculated at lifetime expected credit losses (11.6) As at 31st March 2018 37.0 Movement in expected credit loss allowance on trade receivables calculated at lifetime expected credit losses7.4 As at 31 st March 2019 44.4 (iv) Cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks Credit risk on Cash and Cash Equivalents is limited as the Company generally invests in deposits with banks with high credit ratings assigned by international and domestic credit rating agencies. (B) Liquidity Risk (i) Liquidity risk management Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities and the availability of funding to meet obligations when due. Company's treasury maintains flexibility in funding by maintaining sufficient cash and bank balances available to meet the working capital requirements. Management monitors rolling forecasts of the company's liquidity position (comprising the unused cash and bank balances along with temporary investments in fixed deposits) on the basis of expected cash flows. This is generally carried out at Company level in accordance with practice and limits set by the Company. These limits vary to take into account the liquidity of the market in which the Company operates. (ii) Maturities of financial liabilities The tables below analyse the company's financial liabilities into relevant maturity based on their remaining contractual maturities for all non-derivative financial liabilities. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows. Balances equal their carrying balances as the impact of discounting is not significant. in ` million Contractual maturities of financial liabilitiesLess than 1 year1 to 3 yearsMore than 3 years TotalCarrying value 31st March 2019 Non-derivative financial liabilities Non-Interest bearing 1,355.1 \u2014 \u2014 1,355.1 1,355.1 Fixed interest rate instruments* \u2014 \u2014 18.7 18.7 18.7 Total 1,355.1 \u2014 18.7 1,373.8 1,373.8novartis india limited annual report 2018 - 2019120Notes forming part of the Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31st March 2019 in ` million Contractual maturities of financial liabilitiesLess than 1 year1 to 3 yearsMore than 3 years TotalCarrying value 31st March, 2018 Non-derivative financial liabilities Non-Interest bearing 2,443.3 \u2014 \u2014 2,443.3 2,443.3 Fixed interest rate instruments* \u2014 \u2014 18.2 18.2 18.2 Total 2,443.3 \u2014 18.2 2,461.5 2,461.5 *Effective interest rate is 6.5% Sensitivity interest rate increase by 1%; Profit will decrease by ` 0.2 million for the year ended 31st March 2019 ( ` 0.2 million for the year ended 31st March 2018).

(iii) Maturities of financial assets: The following table details the Company's expected maturity for its non-derivative financial assets. The table has been drawn up based on the undiscounted contractual maturities of the financial assets including interest that will be earned on those assets. The inclusion of information on non-derivative financial assets is necessary in order to understand the Company's liquidity risk management as the liquidity is managed on a net asset and liability basis.

Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions and recognised assets and liabilities denominated in a currency that is not the company's functional currency (`). The risk is measured through a forecast of highly probable foreign currency cash flows. The objective of the Company is to minimise the volatility of the ` cash flows of highly probable forecast transactions.
