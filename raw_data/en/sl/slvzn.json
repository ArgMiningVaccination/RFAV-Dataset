As in the article's examples, my patients offer nonsense like \"I've never had the flu before\" (like rolling double sixes, past event patterns do not predict future events); \"I'm generally pretty healthy\" (right, and the goal is to keep you that way); and my favorite, \"I don't believe in vaccines\" (it's not a religion). Examples in the article are similarly illogical. One woman did not want \"so many toxins\" (vaccines are not toxins). Some desire an \"all-natural\" life (what could be more natural than presenting a tiny amount of a germ's surface proteins to one's immune system so it naturally ramps up to stand ready for the real thing?). Though it may be harsh, I've concluded after 20 years of practice that it is difficult to penetrate ignorance. JAMES SCHWARTZ Barrington, R.I. To the Editor: It was with great dismay that I saw none other than the grande dame of the anti-vaccine movement, Barbara Loe Fisher, quoted in your otherwise excellent article. The writers no doubt wanted to present a balanced view of vaccination, but, frankly, this has to stop. Ms. Fisher and her ilk are by and large responsible for the critical drop in vaccination rates nationwide, and after yet another wholly avoidable outbreak of a preventable disease, it is time to move on and leave these people and their terrible ideas in the dustbin of history, along with flat earthers, AIDS deniers and climate-change skeptics. There is no controversy. Widespread vaccination has greatly contributed to lowered infant mortality and increased life expectancy worldwide. Multiple research papers have established beyond a shadow of a doubt that there is no connection between vaccines and autism. The risks of each vaccine in use today are well known and well documented. Ms. Fisher's organization, the National Vaccine Information Center, and organizations like it exploit the credulity of reasonable and well-intentioned people who just want the best for their children, and they endanger everyone, especially the most vulnerable. The time has come to show them the door. KLAUS STEDEN Los Angeles To the Editor: I am pro-vaccine. As of now, my 11-month-old daughter is completely immunized. Vaccines save countless lives and prevent serious diseases. However, after careful consideration, many discussions with physicians and lots of research, my husband and I have chosen to delay our daughter's M.M.R. vaccine (measles, mumps and rubella) until after she turns 3. I think that there are not enough adequate studies available to prove that the M.M.R. is safe. It is the most highly reactive vaccine on the schedule, and its list of side effects is long. I am disappointed that this article portrays parents who choose not to administer the M.M.R. to their children as hippies who use essential oils and must meditate on their decision. This may be the case for this particular subculture interviewed, but there are others who question it as well: professional, well-educated, pro-vaccine parents who are simply looking for clear safety evidence for this one particular shot. The M.M.R. vaccine clearly warrants further investigation, especially now, with a senior scientist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, William Thompson, claiming that findings of high rates of autism in African-American boys who received the vaccine were withheld. KIM KROONENBURG Brooklyn To the Editor: In 1979, when I was 6 months old, I contracted polio. I was born in Malaysia in a refugee camp for Vietnamese boat people. Unicef had not yet established medical clinics there so I never received my vaccinations. Having seen polio affect so many family members, my parents would have vaccinated me if vaccines had been available. Instead, one summer evening, they watched their 6-month-old infant writhing and crying, sweating and fighting a high fever. The next morning, my left leg went completely limp. The next day, my right arm went limp. There is no herd immunity in many parts of the third world because of limited access to medical care, lack of education and sometimes outright lies by religious and political leaders about immunizations. But we live in a first-world country, where babies who are too young to be vaccinated, adults who are immunosuppressed and others who could not be vaccinated for medical reasons should not be coming down with diseases like the measles and whooping cough. The selfish decision not to vaccinate puts other vulnerable populations at risk of death and disease. Now, whenever children ask me about the leg brace that I wear, I use it as an opportunity to talk about shots and vaccines. But it makes me feel helpless that that may be the only thing I can do in the face of so much misinformation and willful resistance to science. JANICE TA Austin, Tex. To the Editor: A request to parents who refuse to vaccinate their children, from the father of two young boys: You can choose to endanger your kids, but please don't endanger mine. Homeschool your children. That way, you can avoid other kids at schools and also at playgrounds, which you can visit during off hours. JOE WEINSTEIN Bethesda, "}
