The WHO benchmarks represent the minimum requirements for AM training, providing a reference for countries wishing to evaluate and recognise AM training. The WHO already published similar benchmarks for Ayurveda, Unani medicine, traditional Chinese medicine and other traditional and complementary systems. AM is a whole medical system, originating in Europe 100 years ago. A specificity of AM is that it always practiced in integration with conventional Western medicine and that it includes different health professions, all with their specific training. The WHO benchmarks therefore cover the training for the different disciplines, including physicians, nurses, midwifes, pharmacists and different therapists such as eurythmy therapy. As always for this type of benchmarks, the WHO developed the document in collaboration with relevant professional groups, in this case the International Federation of Anthroposophic Medical Associations (IVAA). International training curricula were collected and reviewed and a literature review was conducted. A first draft text was discussed and revised at a WHO Working Group Meeting in 2018. Two global reviews were conducted in 2019 and 2020 and peer reviews from 88 experts incorporated into the text. A WHO Expert Consultation in 2020 and further review within the WHO completed the process. The WHO benchmarks for training provide opportunities for the public, the professions and regulators to ensure that people have access to quality care. For AM, the publication marks a milestone and offers an opportunity for the recognition of AM training and integration into health systems in additional countries, with practices and medicines and integration into hospitals and practices. Training in AM has evolved over the last century, moving from informal settings in anthroposophical hospitals to certified courses with a shared core curriculum. An International Postgraduate Medical Training was established in 2002 and offered training courses across all continents, contributing to the international growth and internationalisation of AM. An International Coordination of Anthroposophic Medicine at the Goetheanum in Switzerland, the global centre for anthroposophy, was established that ensured coordination of training across the different disciplines. The WHO benchmarks therefore come as a culmination in the development of AM training and fully reflect what the AM community itself considers to be minimum training standards.
