Here's a quick video walkthrough to see the all new dashboard features! Your dashboard is customized to you - group classes, 1-on-1 teachers, and workshops are all shown based on [your account profile](https://www.myyogateacher.com/profile) (experience level, yoga goals, medical history, etc) and past class activity. For example, if you've marked yourself as a beginner and take a lot of Vinyasa classes, then you can expect to see: And the recommendations are not just based on the type of yoga, but also your goals with yoga (again, set in [your account profile](https://www.myyogateacher.com/profile)). So if you want to \"ease stress\" then you'll see more relaxing classes. From the new dashboard, you'll also be able to book more than one upcoming instance of the class. So if you're booking 'Yoga for Stress & Anxiety' with Rohan, you can book the class for Monday, Thursday, and/or Saturday at the same time! (Multi-Class Booking is coming to the full group class list soon!) You can always join your next class straight from the dashboard. Now, if you want to see all your upcoming classes - you'll want to go to \"My Classes\" in the navigation menu. Here you'll find all your past class recordings and all your future class bookings. Easy! The new dashboard should make booking and joining classes easier for you. And as always, if you have any questions, you can reach out to [care@myyogateacher.com](mailto:care@myyogateacher.com) - we're happy to help any way we can!
