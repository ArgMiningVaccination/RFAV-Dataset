While there's nothing wrong with having multiple disciplines for different needs, I'm sure most athletes would like a more streamlined approach to solving some of their most present issues, right? Thankfully, there is a method that can help your aches, pain, stress and more \u2014 acupressure. - BEST OVERALL ACUPRESSURE MATBed of Nails Original Acupressure [Read ACUPRESSURE - Set [Read More](#product-71b65cbf-5d0a-4f0b-8672-b8bcf03e2648-anchor) - ACUPRESSURE MAT KITPranamat Eco Basic Massage [Read More](#product-d190d691-9646-4b81-86ea-bcace5b13291-anchor) - ACUPRESSURE MAT FOR RELAXATIONWthn Acupressure Mat Set [Read More](#product-e63859ad-9fa8-4540-a129-5e03f1aede70-anchor) Similar to the ancient Chinese practice of acupuncture, this [therapeutic method](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5388088/) is designed to help increase circulation in key areas while allowing your chi, or energy, to flow freely throughout the body. The results can include reduced soreness across your muscles and joints, improved stress management, better energy stores throughout the day and more. A simple way to partake in this enlightening and helpful practice is by using an acupressure mat or pillow on a daily basis, but with their rising popularity and (let's face it) somewhat intimidating appearance, it can be difficult to decipher which one is right for your needs. How We Tested I've been using acupressure as a worthwhile method for [post-workout recovery](https://www.gearpatrol.com/fitness/a40858396/rest-days-between-workouts/) and [meditation](https://www.gearpatrol.com/fitness/health-wellness/a609491/how-to-meditate-properly/) for a while now, and have had the pleasure of utilizing a number of the below picks in my practice. I've taken note of how large and fitting each mat was to my taller frame, as well as the level of quality experienced across the spike patterns. Comfort across the material was also considered, because after all, you're looking to lay prone on these devices for 10-20 minutes per day. Additionally, I looked at the available accessories and features of each package, whether they included an additional pillow or neck attachment, carrying bag or other extras. Interested in this holistic method bringing a slew of potential to your daily performance? Let's roll out our list of the best acupressure mats available right now. Editor's Note: While there are plenty of benefits to reap from acupressure mats, they shouldn't be used in replacement for medical treatment. If you're in serious pain, mental distress or suffer from conditions including diabetes, bleeding disorders or poor circulation, be sure to consult with your personal healthcare professional prior to use. The Best Acupressure Mats: Bed of Nails Original Acupressure Mat For new and veteran acupressure enthusiasts, it's tough to beat this impressive mat from Bed of Nails. I appreciate the layout of this profile which includes over 8,800 spikes for treatment. This keeps the sensation more approachable yet still provides excellent relief. Plus, the circular HIPS nail plates are non-toxic and feature a glue-free composition, so there's less potential skin irritation. The nail plates of this Bed of Nails silhouette are spaced properly to provide excellent pressure and relief without too much intensity. The Bed of Nails Original Acupressure Mat is also 29 inches long, providing a great surface for more coverage and weight distribution. Plus, the organic cotton cover is removable for easier hand washing. I do wish, though, that the hook-and-loop seam at the top of the profile extended the entire length of the mat itself. You can see the interior foam on occasion, and while this is a cosmetic critique entirely, a cleaner look would make this acupressure silhouette near perfect. Shakti Premium Acupressure Mat If you're looking to personalize your treatment with more or less nails across your frame, consider the Shakti Premium Acupressure Mat. I appreciate this profile as there's various levels available offering between 4,000-8,000 nails per mat. This can be great for those that have a little more experience in the practice, or those that want a final step before moving on to full-blown acupuncture. Additionally, the 29-inch mat length is plenty long enough to cover the back and shoulders. You can choose your own adventure with this Shakti mat, which has nail counts ranging from 4,000-8,000 per bed. There's also some personality at play with this Shakti mat, as the brand offers various colors associated with their level of intensity. While this can make for easier identification pre-treatment, I do wish the color options were a little more balanced. For example, Level 2 mats are available in Pink, Black, Orange and Green, whereas Level 1 and Level 3 mats are solely offered in Yellow and Purple, respectively. ProsourceFit Acupressure Mat and Pillow Set Admittedly, acupressure can be an intimidating discipline to adopt, so it's understood if you're hesitant to drop a wad of cash on a mat you may not even enjoy. Thankfully, there are some worthwhile profiles out there that won't break the bank like this mat and pillow set from Prosource Fit. I appreciate the inclusion of a pillow silhouette in this package, as it can create a more comfortable, ergonomic setup for targeting the neck and base of the skull. Additionally, there's a slew of color options to give your acupressure therapy sessions some added flair. It is worthy to note, though, that this ProsourceFit mat showcases 6,210 points across its surface, and the ABS plastic spikes can be a little more aggressive than others in this roundup. For this reason, those looking for a relieving treatment without as much intensity may want to consider other profiles. Pranamat Eco Full-Body Pro Massage Set I enjoy this kit from Pranamat because the acupressure pillow silhouette mimics more of a throw pillow design. To me, this makes targeting my skull and neck less of a chore, and also extends the overall coverage when both profiles are used simultaneously. Also, this mat and pillow set are constructed from eco-friendly materials, including a coconut fiber filler that provides excellent comfort during practice. All this support and natural composition comes with a hefty price tag, however, so this kit may not be the best for everyone. I view this ensemble as a great advancement pick in your at-home acupressure therapy kit, meaning, once you've established your interest and ability to perform the discipline, this is the set that solidifies your dedication to the craft. Wthn Acupressure Mat Set If you're looking to use acupressure for its relaxing benefits, this is the set for you. I really enjoy coconut fiber filler across this Wthn mat, and the pillow uses memory foam that has the perfect blend of softness and structure. Plus, the 42 spikes per nail bed evenly distribute your weight without too much poking and prodding. The carrying tote compliments this relaxing Wthn profile, making it a breeze to unlock some relief wherever you roam. The Wthn Acupressure Mat Set also comes with a convenient carrying tote, so bringing your mat and pillow with you on the go is a breeze. Need a quick relief in-between meetings at the office? Stretch this mat and pillow across [your chair](https://www.gearpatrol.com/home/a42288452/best-office-chairs/) and log out for a bit. While the mat is shorter than others at just 16 inches, this is still a worthwhile profile for athletes looking to clear their mind and replenish their energy stores. Shakti Premium Acupressure Pillow Athletes looking to use acupressure for neck pain, headaches and other issues can opt for just a pillow silhouette rather than trying to roll a mat up for a supportive profile. This Shakti Premium Acupressure Pillow packs all the impressive features of the brand's aforementioned mat into a sleek, cozy structure that sits comfortably at the base of your skull. I enjoy this pillow silhouette because the fill doesn't lose its contoured shape, even after weeks of daily use. Plus, the nail beds are hand-clipped and placed along the frame without glue, so there's less of a chance of breaks, bends and disconnection over time. I also use this Shakti Premium Acupressure Pillow at the small of my back on occasion, showcasing its versatility in the discipline. Yes, more traditional mats give you more room for coverage, but targeted treatment can also be worthwhile, especially with the right tool for the job. Daiwa Felicity Foot Massager Acupressure can also be very effective for your feet, and to alleviate those post-run aches and sores, consider this Daiwa Felicity silhouette. The circular structure boasts 250 hard plastic nodes, each with four protruding pressure points to help you target those barking dogs. Plus, the Foot Massager is compact and portable at just 1 pound, making it a must-have companion when [traveling for your next marathon](https://www.gearpatrol.com/fitness/a43836586/five-things-i-wish-i-knew-before-my-first-marathon/). As simple and effective as this profile is, though, there are some limitations across the build. For one, the Daiwa Felicity Foot Massager has a maximum weight limit of 250 pounds, so larger athletes may want to look for a sturdier solution to avoid any issues. Additionally, the 13-inch diameter can force you to stand in a narrow stance to receive treatment across both feet. If you're using this device post-training, you may not want to stand in such a position for 3-5 minutes. Spoonk Organic Hemp Acupressure Mat with EcoFoam While other acupressure mats come equipped with a carrying case, it's Spoonk's sling-style tote that makes this my favorite for travel-hungry enthusiasts. Keeping this mat on your person is as simple as strapping on [your favorite backpack](https://www.gearpatrol.com/style/a43659056/best-everyday-backpacks/), and the over 6,000 spikes are great for relieving any present tension on the road. The Organic Hemp Acupressure Mat also features the brand's EcoFoam filler, which feels great when laid atop or rolled up for a pillow. I caution athletes to take their time when getting this mat into and out of the carrying tote, though. Yes, the bag in itself is convenient, but if you're trying to quickly get going, the nail beds could give you more of a poke and prod than desired. Additionally, when rolling the mat up, you don't want to be too aggressive in fear of bending or breaking one of the spikes in the process. Lyapko Flat Acupuncture Applicator If you feel you've graduated to a more intense form of acupressure, then you'll need a nail bed that's literally a de facto bed of nails. This acupressure mat from Lyapko substitutes the approachable plastic pressure points for metal spikes made of iron, silver and nickel. The stubby, prodding sensation can be excellent for those accustomed to the sensation and the heavier nature relies less on bodyweight for a relieving experience. Be warned, however, that this mat is much smaller than other acupressure devices showcased in this roundup. With just under 84 sure inches of coverage, you won't be able to hit your shoulders, back and spine in one fell swoop. Oh well, with a mat as aggressive as this one, it may be best to piecemeal your treatment together through a longer period of time. CXCTCT Extra-Long Yoga Acupressure Mat Set Need an extra long mat for that extra long frame of yours? With nearly 4 feet of length, this premium pick from CXCTCT is ripe with potential for those taller enthusiasts. I also enjoy this mat because some of the nail beds are magnetized, which can help promote better circulation in key areas. Additionally, this Acupressure Mat Set comes with a slew of other pressure-minded tools for full-body relief, including a pillow, ball and roller for all your aches and pains. Admittedly, though, this spiky layout may be too spiky for effective treatment in target areas. The mat, for example, boasts 50 nail beds with 50 pressure points each. While coverage is ample, your weight could be too well distributed across these nodes for worthwhile pressure. Still, though, with all the tools in tote for less than $70, this kit is definitely worth consideration, especially if you desire full-body sessions. The Benefits of Using an Acupressure Mat Tension Relief and Relaxation When you lay atop an acupressure may, you're applying small pricks and prods to key areas along the body. This can generate a response to increase circulation in these spots, [according to studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21208128/), which can help alleviate any tension or soreness. Additionally, this increased blood flow can create a relaxing environment as your body adjusts to the perceived stress of the spikes. Your heart rate can begin to slow after the immediate sensation, resulting in a calmer state. Pain Management Increased circulation and blood flow along the targeted trigger points can be great for loosening muscles and keeping pain at bay, too. Research is still being conducted on the long-term effects of acupressure as it relates to pain management, but [short-term examples](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3446809/) indicate a positive effect. Improved Mental Health and Energy Lying on an acupressure mat can be a great way to deal with stress, anxiety and other energy-depleting worries. The spikes send signals to your brain that blood flow is needed in the targeted areas and the increased circulation can slowly begin to calm your body. After a few minutes, your breath can begin to slow, resulting in a clearer mindset and more positive state. Then, once you've completed your allotted minutes, you're left with a frame that's well lubricated and active, which can be translated as a more energy. How to Choose an Acupressure Mat Size One of the major factors to consider when choosing an acupressure mat is its size. Laying on a mat that's too small to apply pressure across your entire back limits the benefits you can experience. If you're wanting a full-body treatment, you'll naturally need a mat that covers your entire height. Be sure to pay close attention to your mat's dimensions and choose one that gives you enough coverage for worthwhile treatment. Materials When lying on a bed of spiky plastic nodes, you want as much comfort as possible (as much of an oxymoron as that may be). To create this cozy aesthetic, look for mats that use a comfortable padding and durable materials. This can help keep your gear in top shape for daily use without the need for multiple replacements down the road. Regarding the spikes, most mats use a plastic or metal setup. Make sure these prods are sturdy enough to withstand daily pressure without bending or breaking. Finally, you should be working toward acupressure treatment against bare skin, but that's no reason to keep your setup unhygienic. Try to search for mats using eco-friendly textiles that don't pose a threat to your skin health. Spikes When it comes to the spikes across your acupressure mat, the more, the better. Having more spikes across the setup places extra pressure points across your skin, which in turn disperses your weight more and can lead to a less uncomfortable starting sensation. Of course, as you advance and want to target more specific areas, you can opt for a mat with less prods, but generally speaking, you want a mat with as many spikes as possible to start. Most well-to-do mats will feature anywhere from 6,000-8,000 spikes across the treatment area. Additional Features Some mats can also come with a complimentary pillow that can be great for treatment across the neck and base of the skull. Additionally, some may feature a convenient carrying case or strap, ideal for reaping the therapeutic benefits on the road. Both of these add-ons aren't absolutely vital to your experience, but they can be decent perks if the packages stay within your price range. Take your personal needs, wants and budget into consideration when searching for acupressure mats donning these helpful extras. How to Use an Acupressure Mat Now, diving headfirst into using an acupressure mat is something not advised \u2014 you're laying atop a mat of spikes, after all. For your first few sessions, look to wear light clothing, like [a t-shirt](https://www.gearpatrol.com/fitness/a34758452/best-workout-shirts/), to serve as a barrier between the prods and your skin. As you grow accustomed to the sensation, you can advance to treatment across bare skin. Start your treatment by easing into position. Try to disperse your weight evenly as you get into your stance. You can either lay your mat on the ground or [atop your bed](https://www.gearpatrol.com/home/g38846563/best-mattress/), or place your acupressure mat along a chair for added comfort. Once you're in position, take slow, deep breaths to try and relax. You may feel a tingly sensation as your weight sinks over the spikes, but any potential pain should begin to subside after 30 seconds. Try to aim for 5-10 minutes of prone lying at first, and slowly work your way up to 20 or 30 minutes daily. Be sure to remain still during treatment to help prevent any errant "}
