The biological mechanisms by which immersion in mineral-medicinal water and the application of mud alleviate symptoms of several pathologies are still not completely understood, but it is known that neuroendocrine and immunological responses\u2014including both humoral and cell-mediated immunity\u2014to balneotherapy are involved in these mechanisms of effectiveness; leading to anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antioxidant, chondroprotective, and anabolic effects together with neuroendocrine-immune regulation in different conditions. Hormesis can play a critical role in all these biological effects and mechanisms of effectiveness. The hormetic effects of balneotherapy can be related to non-specific factors such as heat\u2014which induces the heat shock response, and therefore the synthesis and release of heat shock proteins\u2014and also to specific biochemical components such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in sulfurous water and radon in radioactive water. Results from several investigations suggest that the beneficial effects of balneotherapy and hydrotherapy are consistent with the concept of hormesis, and thus support a role for hormesis in hydrothermal treatments.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2018-06-06", "cleaned_text": "Introduction [1](#B1-ijms-19-01687), [2](#B2-ijms-19-01687)]. This response to low doses of stress is considered an adaptive compensatory process or adaptive stress response following an initial disruption in homeostasis, enhancing the ability of the organism to withstand more severe stress [ [1](#B1-ijms-19-01687), [2](#B2-ijms-19-01687)]. Therefore, a hormetin has been defined as any condition that may be potentially hormetic in physiological terms by activating or upregulating one or more cellular and molecular pathways of stress response that protect against a similar but more severe stress [ [3](#B3-ijms-19-01687)]. Apart from chemicals and toxins, there are several conditions and factors that can be considered hormetins: biological hormetins such as infections, hypoxia/ischemia, endogenous metabolic products, dietary caloric restriction, intermittent fasting, and micronutrients; psychological hormetins such as mental challenge and meditation; and physical hormetins such as exercise, heat, and radiation [ [3](#B3-ijms-19-01687), [4](#B4-ijms-19-01687)]. Indeed, repeated mild heat stress-induced hormesis affects various parameters of cellular aging and other functional characteristics, such as differentiation, wound healing and angiogenesis. These hormetic effects lead to a significant biological response that results in an overall improvement of the living system [ [5](#B5-ijms-19-01687)]. In this context, thermotherapeutic strategies such as balneotherapy and hydrotherapy can be considered potential hormetic interventions. [6](#B6-ijms-19-01687)]. Temperature has a central role in the effects of balneotherapy. Mineral-medicinal water and mud are generally applied hot since they are excellent vehicles for the transference of heat\u2014being able to hold heat and release it slowly\u2014so these treatments can be considered thermotherapeutic interventions. The peculiarity of balneotherapy is that its beneficial effects on the organism are brought about not only by the physical properties of mineral-medicinal water and mud, but also by their chemical and biological composition. Conversely, in other spa treatments such as hydrotherapy\u2014in which plain tap water is used\u2014only the physical properties of water (temperature, hydrostatic pressure, hydrodynamics, buoyancy, viscosity, electric conductivity, etc.) take part in the beneficial effects of the intervention [ [6](#B6-ijms-19-01687)]. 2. Balneotherapy as a Strategy for Health [7](#B7-ijms-19-01687)]. Thermal baths are considered an integral part of traditional medicine in many cultures and countries (France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Turkey, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Russia, Israel, Japan and others), and nowadays they are a relevant part of the public health systems of many countries within and outside Europe [ [8](#B8-ijms-19-01687)]. [9](#B9-ijms-19-01687), [10](#B10-ijms-19-01687)]. In the recent decades, more and more studies (including high-quality meta-analysis and systematic reviews) have reported the beneficial effects of balneotherapy, including mud therapy, on different clinical outcomes in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) [ [11](#B11-ijms-19-01687), conditions [ [24](#B24-ijms-19-01687)]. Of all these pathologies, OA is the most commonly treated with balneological interventions. The main clinical parameters improved by balneotherapy and mud therapy in OA are analgesic drug consumption, function, stiffness, pain, and quality of life [ [13](#B13-ijms-19-01687), [14](#B14-ijms-19-01687)]. Since these therapies have little to no adverse effects, they are especially important for OA patients, who usually are elderly patients with multimorbidity- and polypharmacy-related risk of adverse events. In fact, the most recent guidelines from the Osteoartritis Research Society International (OARSI) state that balneotherapy is appropriate in OA patients with comorbidities, for whom treatment options are limited [ [25](#B25-ijms-19-01687)]. [9](#B9-ijms-19-01687)]. While the former are well known [ [26](#B26-ijms-19-01687)], the latter are difficult to identify and assess [ [27](#B27-ijms-19-01687)]. Indeed, as a result of the elevated application temperature\u2014generally ranging from 38 to 42 \u00b0C\u2014thermotherapeutic effects are the basis of these treatments [ [27](#B27-ijms-19-01687), [28](#B28-ijms-19-01687)]. Notwithstanding, absorption of biologically active inorganic and organic substances through the skin also play a role in the effectiveness of balneotherapy. In vitro and in vivo studies have established that some water-soluble minerals are able to permeate human skin [ [29](#B29-ijms-19-01687), [30](#B30-ijms-19-01687), [31](#B31-ijms-19-01687)] and seem to be the key mechanism responsible for the improvement in some clinical outcomes, in both balneotherapy and mud that those beneficial effects are not exclusively linked to the action of heat. Despite this increasing evidence, it is difficult to analyze the specific effects of each mechanism and each chemical component separately. Each mineral-medicinal water and mud around the world has different distinctive physical properties and chemical composition. According to their predominant ions and gases, mineral-medicinal waters may be classified as chlorated, sulfated, bicarbonated, ferruginous, carbogaseous, sulfurous and radioactive [ [40](#B40-ijms-19-01687)]. It is known that, generally, different diseases require agents with different chemical compositions in order to attain therapeutic results [ [41](#B41-ijms-19-01687)]. However, the exact components that are most suitable for each pathology and the ideal concentration of each element that is necessary for obtaining optimal biological and clinical outcomes have not yet been completely elucidated. [27](#B27-ijms-19-01687), [39](#B39-ijms-19-01687)]. Whichever of these mechanisms are implicated to a lesser or larger extent, the physiological responses arising from balneotherapy consist mainly of neuroendocrine and immunological effects that have been most widely studied in rheumatic pathologies. 3. Balneotherapy [46](#B46-ijms-19-01687), [48](#B48-ijms-19-01687)], as well as an increase in anti-inflammatory growth factor IGF-1 [ [38](#B38-ijms-19-01687), [42](#B42-ijms-19-01687)]. It is noteworthy that, in a recent study, our group carried out a comprehensive evaluation of the effect of mud therapy on the cytokine profile of OA patients. Our data showed a drastic decline in the unhealthily elevated systemic levels of IL-1, TNF-, IL-8 (remarkably for the first time), IL-6 and TGF-, thus confirming a global anti-inflammatory effect of this strategy [ [49](#B49-ijms-19-01687)]. Mud therapy can also decrease circulating levels of the adipokines adiponectin and resistin in OA [ cytokines and adipokines are important mediators of inflammation and cartilage metabolism [ [52](#B52-ijms-19-01687)], and thus their modulation after balneotherapy leads to anti-inflammatory-mediated chondroprotective effects that may play a beneficial role in rheumatic conditions such as OA. [53](#B53-ijms-19-01687)]. MMP-3 serum levels decrease after mud therapy in OA patients [ [54](#B54-ijms-19-01687)]\u2014either as a direct effect of the intervention or as a consequence of the reduction in pro-inflammatory mediators such as cytokines that promote MMP secretion\u2014suggesting that mud therapy contributes to extracellular matrix integrity. In fact, serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) concentration\u2014an indicator inflammatory mediators [ [57](#B57-ijms-19-01687)]. There is evidence that balneotherapy and mud therapy reduce circulating levels of these biomarkers in patients with rheumatic pathologies [ [47](#B47-ijms-19-01687), [58](#B58-ijms-19-01687)]. It is well known that the inflammatory response plays a key role in the development and persistence of many pathological pain states. Since they are part of the inflammatory response, certain pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF- are strongly involved in the process of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. They can directly modulate neuronal activity in the peripheral and central nervous system and promote the production of other mediators related to inflammation and pain\u2014such as substance P and PGE2\u2014contributing to hyperalgesia and allodyinia [ [59](#B59-ijms-19-01687)]. In this way, reduction in these mediators' levels after balneotherapy can also be associated with the analgesic effects of the treatment, as demonstrated by concomitant declines in perceived pain [ [47](#B47-ijms-19-01687), [49](#B49-ijms-19-01687)]. [60](#B60-ijms-19-01687)]\u2014that improved significantly after mud therapy. Circulating monocytes' phenotype and functional capacity seem to be also involved in the innate/inflammatory response induced by this treatment. In addition, changes in the percentage of circulating regulatory T cells are also implicated in the cytokine-mediated anti-inflammatory effect of balneotherapy (unpublished data, submitted for publication). 4. Balneotherapy and Stress [61](#B61-ijms-19-01687)]), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and cortisol release [ [62](#B62-ijms-19-01687)], the latter being especially important because of its anti-inflammatory effects and ability to inhibit the production of most cytokines [ [63](#B63-ijms-19-01687)]. At the same time, activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) by stressors stimulates the release of catecholamines [ [62](#B62-ijms-19-01687)]. [64](#B64-ijms-19-01687), [65](#B65-ijms-19-01687)]. This activation was manifested by increased circulating of ACTH [ [66](#B66-ijms-19-01687), [67](#B67-ijms-19-01687)], cortisol [70](#B70-ijms-19-01687), [73](#B73-ijms-19-01687)]. However, there is scarce evidence on the specific effects of balneotherapy on the neuroendocrine/stress response. Besides, it is important to study these effects in different pathologies and conditions, since the presence of HPA axis and neuroendocrine-immune dysregulations in rheumatic disorders and chronic very common [ [60](#B60-ijms-19-01687), [63](#B63-ijms-19-01687), [74](#B74-ijms-19-01687)]. [75](#B75-ijms-19-01687)]. In FM patients, for example, mud therapy induces an increase in ACTH, cortisol, and -endorphin systemic concentrations [ [76](#B76-ijms-19-01687)]. Recently, our group reported a neuroendocrine-immune regulation in OA patients undergoing mud therapy: an increase in circulating cortisol concentrations that contributes to decrease the elevated systemic levels of inflammatory cytokines in this pathology [ [49](#B49-ijms-19-01687)]. These results seem to be in line with the above-mentioned studies in hydrotherapy, thus suggesting that the effects of balneotherapy on the neuroendocrine system are mainly due to heat stress caused by the elevated temperature of application. [77](#B77-ijms-19-01687)]. In this way, HS response and Hsp could play a role in the beneficial effects of balneotherapy [ [78](#B78-ijms-19-01687)]. [Figure 1](#ijms-19-01687-f001)shows a proposed model of a mechanism of action of balneotherapy in OA patients integrating its effects on the immune and stress responses. 5. Balneotherapy as a Hormetic Strategy 5.1. Heat Stress Hormetic Effects in Balneotherapy [26](#B26-ijms-19-01687), [64](#B64-ijms-19-01687)], and it is linked to the ability of organisms to respond to stress and produce cellular responses of adaptation [ [3](#B3-ijms-19-01687)]. Whereas severe heat stress leads to cellular damage and cell death, mild heat stress induces the HS response, which protects cells and organisms from severe damage, allows resumption of normal cellular and physiological activities, and leads to a higher level of thermotolerance [ [79](#B79-ijms-19-01687)]. An important aspect of stress responses is that they have the potential to induce higher levels of stress tolerance and greater resistance to subsequent stress damage from more than one type of stress. In this way, mild heat stress can protect from oxidative stress or toxin damage [ [2](#B2-ijms-19-01687), [80](#B80-ijms-19-01687)]. In the HS response, cells activate a signaling pathway leading to the expression of Hsp. The Hsp70 (70 kDa heat shock protein) family consists of a class of Hsp that includes the stress-inducible Hsp70 (Hsp72, 72 kDa). Under normal physiological conditions, Hsp72 is expressed at low levels. However, following stress stimuli such as heat and inflammation, synthesis of intracellular Hsp72 (iHsp72) and release of extracellular Hsp72 (eHsp72) increase iHsp72 plays a crucial role in cytoprotection and cytotoxicity tolerance as an intracellular molecular chaperone involved in cell aging, survival, and protection against potentially harmful stress stimuli [ [81](#B81-ijms-19-01687), [82](#B82-ijms-19-01687), [83](#B83-ijms-19-01687)]. [84](#B84-ijms-19-01687)]\u2014a hormetin with bioregulatory effects frequently used as a therapy for different pathologies [ [4](#B4-ijms-19-01687)]\u2014since both strategies have the potential to improve impaired insulin sensitivity and boost endothelial expression of the constitutive isoform of nitric oxide synthase, promoting vascular health [ [84](#B84-ijms-19-01687)]. In fact, hydrotherapy at 38-41 \u00b0C (18 sessions of 30 min) reduced body weight, fasting plasma glucose levels and mean glycated hemoglobin levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [ [85](#B85-ijms-19-01687)]. In rats, bathing for 15 min in hot plain water (40-42 \u00b0C) increased Hsp72 heart tissue concentration contributing to cardioprotection against ischemia injury [ [86](#B86-ijms-19-01687)], and increased Hsp72 artery expression, mediating the suppression of neointimal thickening in injured arteries [ [87](#B87-ijms-19-01687)]. Furthermore, Bathaie and co-workers [ [88](#B88-ijms-19-01687)] found that diabetic rats undergoing hydrotherapy at 42 \u00b0C (60 sessions of 30 min each) presented improvements in lipid profile, antioxidant capacity, insulin secretion and advanced glycation end (AGE) products, together with an increase in serum eHsp72 levels that may be directly related to the beneficial effects of the therapy. In young and aged insulin-resistant monkeys, hydrotherapy at 40 \u00b0C (10 sessions of 30 min) improved blood pressure, glucose values, pancreatic responses to glucose challenge and tended to normalize glucose excursions, together with significantly higher concentrations of muscle Hsp70. There were no adverse effects on organ or cardiovascular health [ [89](#B89-ijms-19-01687)]. Krause and co-workers [ [90](#B90-ijms-19-01687)] proposed that all these cardiovascular and metabolic benefits of hydrotherapy seem to be related to the induction of Hsp70 expression in response to heat stress, which enhances the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and endothelial nitric oxide synthase. Together, they could improve insulin signaling, body composition, endothelial dysfunction, and the low-grade inflammation found in people with diabetes [ [90](#B90-ijms-19-01687)]. These investigations support the safety and efficacy of hydrotherapy as a preventive and therapeutic strategy in patients with metabolic syndrome that are too physically impaired to perform exercise at optimal intensities. [55](#B55-ijms-19-01687)], probably because the temperature was not high enough to elicit a response. Balneotherapy and mud therapy interventions (seven sessions, temperature and duration unknown) have been shown to increase Hsp70 gene expression in healthy subjects [ [78](#B78-ijms-19-01687)]. Surprisingly, our research group recently found a reduction in systemic eHsp72 concentrations in elderly OA patients after 10 sessions of balneotherapy with mud application at 38-42 \u00b0C for 60 min, in parallel with a marked decrease in the serum concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines. OA patients presented increased serum and pro-inflammatory cytokines concentrations at baseline compared to age-matched healthy controls, and they reached similar values to those of controls after the therapy [ [49](#B49-ijms-19-01687)]. Similarly, Uzunolu and co-workers [ [91](#B91-ijms-19-01687)] assessed the effect of balneotherapy (39-40 \u00b0C for 15 min during three weeks) on Hsp in OA patients. Serum eHsp72 concentrations initially increased after the first session, but at the end of the protocol eHsp72 systemic concentration was lower than baseline, implying that an adaptation might occur at the end of the intervention. [81](#B81-ijms-19-01687), [92](#B92-ijms-19-01687)]. Conversely to iHsp72 (anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective), eHsp72 can act as a pro-inflammatory mediator, producing an immune/inflammatory response involving the activation of immune effector cells and cytokine release [ [93](#B93-ijms-19-01687)], particularly inflammatory cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines with the participation of nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-) [ [94](#B94-ijms-19-01687), [95](#B95-ijms-19-01687)]. Moreover, due to its capacity to affect the production of cytokines that in turn induce neuroendocrine responses, eHsp72 is an intrinsic component of the immune-neuro-endocrine network [ [96](#B96-ijms-19-01687)]. In this way, modulation of eHsp72 circulating concentrations after heat stress could trigger an Hsp-cytokine-HPA-cortisol anti-inflammatory feedback mechanism, leading to anti-inflammatory effects and neuroendocrine-immune regulation [ [49](#B49-ijms-19-01687)]. Therefore, it could be speculated that the paradoxical decrease of eHsp72 in our study reflects a lower release of eHsp72 after a potential heat-induced iHsp72 increase in OA tissues such as chondrocytes [ [49](#B49-ijms-19-01687)]. Thus, the ratio iHsp72/eHsp72 is crucial to evaluate the effectiveness of thermotherapy [ [97](#B97-ijms-19-01687)]. 5.2. Hydrogen Sulfide has important physiological functions as an endogenous cell signaling molecule on the regulation of inflammation (through NF-) and oxidative stress\u2014acting as a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger and increasing levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and and that sulfated thermal waters inhibit nitric oxide (NO) production and apoptosis induced by IL-1 in OA chondrocytes. Moreover, another investigation showed that sulfurous water had higher antioxidant capacity against pro-oxidant stimuli than classical reference antioxidants compounds, leading to a protective effect on DNA stability and cell viability of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of both Alzheimer's disease patients and healthy controls [ [106](#B106-ijms-19-01687)]. Furthermore, there is evidence that H2S treatment reduces both spontaneous and IL-1-induced secretion of IL-6, IL-8 and RANTES, as well as expression of MMP-2 and MMP-14 in cultured fibroblast-like synoviocytes from OA patients [ [107](#B107-ijms-19-01687)]. TNF-, IL-6 and IL-10) and counterbalances the of ROS and RNS by human monocytes [ [108](#B108-ijms-19-01687)], and reduces NO, PGE2, IL-6 and MMP13 released by OA chondrocytes by downregulating genes involved in the synthesis routes of these molecules as well as NF- nuclear translocation [ [109](#B109-ijms-19-01687)]. [45](#B45-ijms-19-01687), [110](#B110-ijms-19-01687), [111](#B111-ijms-19-01687)], have been found after balneotherapy with sulfurous water in rheumatic diseases, thus reflecting a reduction in oxidative stress that may contribute to reduce the inflammatory and catabolic status. Indeed, sulfurous waters are clinically effective in the treatment of OA and RA patients [ [112](#B112-ijms-19-01687), [113](#B113-ijms-19-01687)]. [114](#B114-ijms-19-01687)]. The combination of bathing in and drinking sulfurous water is a common practice, and it can increase plasma thiol levels and decrease circulating levels of MDA, carbonlys, MMP-2, COMP and TNF- in OA patients [ [45](#B45-ijms-19-01687)]. These improvements in the redox status could potentially confer protection against age- and disease-related oxidative damage. In a series of very interesting studies, beneficial effects of drinking sulfurous water on diabetes and long term diabetes-associated complications have been reported. Diabetic rats drank sulfurous mineral-medicinal water for 6-7 weeks. Anti-diabetic effects of sulfurous water were evidenced by increased serum concentrations of insulin, C-peptide and IGF-1, and by a reduction in glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels, indicating a return towards normal conditions [ [115](#B115-ijms-19-01687), [116](#B116-ijms-19-01687), [117](#B117-ijms-19-01687)]. Cardiac GSH and protein thiols increased while glutathione disulfide levels decreased, thus boosting the antioxidant status. This improvement in cardiac GSH levels caused a reduction in NF- as well as MMP-2, procollagen-1 and Fas-L gene expression in the left ventricle. By counteracting these pro-apoptotic and pro-fibrogenic factors, sulfurous mineral water prevented the development of fibrosis in the heart [ [115](#B115-ijms-19-01687)]. Regarding diabetic nephropathy, sulfurous water counteracted the elevation of renal thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and replenished GSH levels in diabetic rats with impaired kidney function. Improvements in renal redox balance were also reflected on improved kidney function [ [117](#B117-ijms-19-01687)]. Diabetes also impairs testicular function, and drinking sulfurous water improved the seminiferous tubule structure as well as the number of spermatogenic cells and testosterone levels in diabetic rats, probably due to an increase in testicular GSH by blocking the overexpression of apoptosis-related regulatory proteins such as Bax/Bcl-2, cytochrome c, caspase-9 and -3, and p53 [ Radon Hormetic Effects in Balneotherapy [118](#B118-ijms-19-01687)]. Although ionizing radiation has been shown to be carcinogenic at high doses, at low doses it produces biologically beneficial effects by initially causing low-level molecular damage, which then leads to the activation of one or more stress response pathways and therefore induces adaptive mechanisms [ [3](#B3-ijms-19-01687)] that may prevent cancer as well as other adverse health effects [ [1](#B1-ijms-19-01687), [119](#B119-ijms-19-01687)]. Mechanisms of radiation-induced hormetic response include activation of DNA repair, scavenging of free radicals, elimination of damaged cells by apoptosis, synthesis of stress proteins such as Hsp, and stimulation of the immune response [ [119](#B119-ijms-19-01687), [120](#B120-ijms-19-01687)]. [121](#B121-ijms-19-01687)] proved that radon spa therapy was more effective than thermotherapy alone in enhancing antioxidant functions (SOD and catalase activities) and in increasing ACTH, -endorphin, and insulin levels, among other biomarkers. These results indicate that radon in spa therapy adds further beneficial hormetic outcomes to those of thermal interventions alone, suggesting a synergistic effect of heat and radon. The same group obtained similar results in another study in OA patients undergoing radon spa therapy. There was an improvement in antioxidant and immune function together with changes in pain-associated biomarkers [ [122](#B122-ijms-19-01687)]. Conversely, another study carried out in patients with degenerative musculoskeletal disorders found no significant effects on the human endocrine system after balneotherapy with a very low radon content, suggesting that a minimum radon concentration is required in order to exert biological effects [ [123](#B123-ijms-19-01687)]. Therefore, radon spa therapy at optimal radon concentrations could be a useful complementary therapy in metabolic syndrome and rheumatic diseases such and co-workers [ [129](#B129-ijms-19-01687)] showed significantly better pain reduction in the long term after radon spa therapy in rheumatic pathologies. [Table 1](#ijms-19-01687-t001)presents a summary of the most relevant studies\u2014according to quality (original research, appropriate experimental design and methodology, English language, indexed in PubMed) and originality\u2014regarding potential biological biomarkers mediating clinical benefits of different modalities of spa therapy, and proposed hormetic mechanisms participating, at least partially, in these effects. 6.
