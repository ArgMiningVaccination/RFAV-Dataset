The COVID-19 pandemic altered the trajec - tory of everyone's personal and professional lives. Preventive guidance to mitigate this novel virus, including universal masking and social distanc - ing, has led to a more virtual, isolated existence that is challenging us all. In a very short time, how we work, shop, hold family/social gatherings, care for vulnerable loved ones, learn, and interact has changed. Looking back on this year, what have we, as infection preventionists (IPs), learned, and what can we envision as we look forward? I am proud of IPs for their dedication and sacrifice to patient and health - care worker safety. IPs embraced the challenge and chaos in the earliest days of the pandemic and tirelessly continue the ongoing tumultuous journey to get this pandemic under control. Many of us experienced surges of COVID-19 cases that stretched healthcare organizations, communities, and ourselves to the breaking point, and we made it through with more to come. We were overwhelmed with a deluge of feelings and experiences: courage, fear, sorrow, compassion, anger, exhaustion, confusion, teamwork, loneliness, and a sense of accomplishment when things came together. While IPs ride this COVID-19 roller coaster, many will use their exper - tise to help their communities and other healthcare environments. This Prevention Strategist issue includes stories of IPs who share their expertise with nonhealthcare entities (pages 42-44), and post-acute care settings (pages 46-48). This publication also includes insightful quotes from fel - low IPs about what they have learned this year and what they hope 2021 brings (pages 56-57)! Michelle King said: \"Sometimes no matter how true or helpful your message is, some people are not ready to listen. Don't give up trying to be heard. Don't give up what is right and true.\" IPs don't give up easily! As we wait for a vaccine, COVID-19 cases are surging again and everyone continues to wear masks (page 16). Looking forward, we must remain vigilant, learn from opportunities, and continue our work for the safety of our patients, frontline providers, and community. As 2021 approaches, Devin Jopp, EdD, MS, begins as the APIC CEO effective December 7, 2020 (read his first column on page 8). Devin brings an impressive lineup of skills to the CEO role. We are fortunate to have found someone with Devin's vision, commitment, and in-depth knowledge across the healthcare spectrum to lead APIC as we charter a course into the future. How we work and live is ever changed due to COVID-19. Looking forward, APIC will adjust course to meet the needs of our membership in this changing healthcare continuum and post-COVID era. In closing, I want to express my gratitude for the privilege of serving as your 2020 president. It has been an honor to work with a dynamic board and outstanding staff. As I think back on 2020, I will remember the pas - sion, dedication, resilience, and tireless work of the APIC community to meet the challenge of COVID-19. To my esteemed colleague and incoming president, Ann Marie Pettis, I extend my best wishes. Sincerely yours, Connie Steed, MSN, RN, CIC, FAPIC 2020 APIC PresidentLooking back, looking forward 6 | WINTER 2020 | Prevention 1. References list: https://www.nozin.com/clinical-outcomes.

I'm so grateful for the work that you all do every day to keep our families and communities safe from dangerous infections. I want to thank you for the countless hours spent and the personal sacrifices made working to prevent the spread of COVID-19. I want to thank you for allowing me the honor and opportunity to serve this amazing organization as your new CEO. In Twelfth Night, William Shakespeare wrote, \"some are born great, some achieve greatness, and others have greatness thrust upon them.\" As I've gotten to know APIC, I see all aspects of greatness in this organiza - tion, from its founding in 1972, to the amazing accomplishments that this organization has achieved to advance our collective mission of creating a safer world through infection prevention and control. And now, in this pivotal moment in world history, we are faced with one of the greatest public health challenges in modern times with the arrival of COVID-19. This is our moment; and indeed, greatness has been thrust upon us as we work to protect and respond to our world, our nation, and our families under siege. We find ourselves in a new environment that has taken an already fast-paced world and hyper-accelerated it to new levels. Peter Vaill's book, Learning as a Way of Being , talks about true learning happening in turbu - lent times, or what he calls whitewater. As we're faced with these stressful, uneasy, difficult, and ever-changing times, we must also recognize that in this whitewater, our greatest opportunity for learning and adaptation emerges. While it's difficult to predict the future with certainty, one thing is very clear: our collective efforts through APIC bind us together, make us stronger, and allow us to tap our combined knowledge and ingenuity to adapt and lead through these turbulent times. Words cannot begin to describe my gratitude for being selected to serve as your next CEO. It's such an honor and pleasure to join this organization at such a critical inflection point and to serve shoulder-to-shoulder with you, not only during this pandemic, but as we lead the way forward in elevating the importance of infection prevention and control across all aspects of our society. As I onboard, I look forward to getting to know the APIC members. One of my earliest priorities will be setting up opportunities to listen and learn about our history, our future, our opportunities, and our challenges. I also plan to hold a series of townhalls in December, where I hope you'll be able to join me virtually. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to contact me at djopp@apic.org if you have any thoughts, questions, or insights that you'd like to share.

Making Theraworx Protect advanced hygiene solution part of your COVID-19 assessment and control plan is one way to ensure you're doing everything you can to help safeguard patients as well as front-line healthcare workers. Avadim Health, Inc. 877-677-2723 81 Thompson Street Asheville, NC 28803 AHI20-213Advanced Hygiene Where It Matters Most Theraworx Protect is a clinically proven, no-rinse hygiene solution that helps protect not only the hands but also the face. Our non-toxic formulation is safe to use even on the T -zone\u2014the eyes, nose and mouth\u2014an area that leaves us most vulnerable to infection. In fact, because Theraworx Protect is safe to use on the ocular mucous membranes, it can be used as an additional ocular contact safety measure. What's More Theraworx Protect supports the skin's natural antimicrobial barrier and defensive functions, helping to prevent skin breakdown and maintain the integrity of the skin underneath PPE. And unlike alcohol-based products, Theraworx Protect supports the skin for up to 4-6 hours, meaning fewer re-applications. 1023573_Avadim.indd 1 10/29/20 7:31 PMCELEBRATING EXCELLENCE RINGING IN THE New Year often evokes a yearning to leave the previous year's troubles behind and embark on a fresh start. This was the predominant thought on the minds of everyone this time last year, however, as evidenced by the saying \"you never know,\" 2020 did not turn out to be the new start we all envisioned. 2020 did however put the spotlight on the field of infection preven - tion and highlighted the foundational work that has enabled infection preventionists everywhere to persevere. To those who have been in the field for years, just starting out, or somewhere in the middle, I want to say thank you. We know the challenges from 2020 will carry over into 2021, and to that end CBIC will be here to support those already certified and those who are working toward that goal. CBIC has made great strides despite the rather tumultuous turn of events. The recertification by Infection Prevention Units (IPUs) and the entry-level Associate-Infection Prevention and Control (a-IPC) examination both launched this year. These initiatives involved a great deal of strategic planning and seeing them come to fruition has been extremely rewarding. With the completion of the first year of recertification using continuing education, we look forward to exploring the possibilities that this new recertification pathway presents. The CBIC Board and staff are thrilled to witness the expansion of certification and bring in a new audience with the entry-level a-IPC certification. There are already numerous a-IPCs practic - ing in their chosen field, and we look forward to seeing their careers flourish. For those looking for a pathway into the field, we encourage you to apply. As with any new initiative, we understand the importance of hearing from those who completed this exam and using such feedback to make any necessary improvements. Be on the lookout for your chance to participate! This year CBIC conducted a Practice Analysis to review the content of the certification exam. A Practice Analysis is the foundation on which the CIC exam is built and ensures that the exam content stays relevant to those practicing in the field of infection prevention and control. Thank you to all the individuals who participated in our 2020 Practice Analysis survey; your responses were vital to the exam development process. We look forward to sharing the results with the infection prevention community. On behalf of the CBIC Board of Directors and staff, I want to thank you all for your contin - ued support and encouragement throughout the year. I also want to express appreciation for the leadership that the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC) and Infection Prevention and Control Canada (IPAC) continue to provide to members of the infection prevention community. I want to conclude by recognizing the IPC community for all the hard work you have done to keep the public safe during this pandemic. It is both a pleasure and an honor to represent such outstanding leaders in this industry. I know my colleague Janet Glowicz will provide exceptional leadership as the 2021 CBIC President and Roy Boukidjian will continue his support for certifica - tion as his term ends. Additionally, I want to thank the CBIC staff for continuing to answer my call for help, particularly Anne Krolikowski, CBIC's former executive director, whose leadership enabled us to continue to serve our members and fulfill the mission and vision of CBIC.

Flu vaccine is essential to help prevent illness during the pandemic Both COVID-19 and the seasonal flu will be spreading simultaneously this fall and winter, so everyone should do their part to prevent illness. Make sure you and your family get the flu vaccine and follow basic infection prevention practices to prevent COVID-19. Taking these actions will protect you and your loved ones and also conserve hospital beds and medical supplies for seriously ill patients. Do your part to safeguard your community! Visit vaccinefinder.org to find a flu shot location near you. Fight Flu with a Flu Shot Everyone, every year. Each person 6 months of age and older needs a flu vaccine each year. This includes pregnant women and people with chronic health conditions. Vaccines are updated from one season to the next. Flu viruses are constantly changing so you need to get vaccinated each year. Protect your herd. Vaccination protects us as a community so that individuals who can not be vaccinated\u2014such as newborns and the immunocompromised\u2014are afforded some protection. It's not too late to get a flu shot. The flu season usually starts in October and lasts through May. You should get your shot before the end of October but waiting until January or February may still offer protection. Safe and effective. Flu vaccines have a good safety record. Minor side effects may include soreness or swelling at the injection site and low-grade fever and aches. While some people who get vaccinated still get sick, their illness is usually less severe.Follow the Basics of COVID-19 Prevention Wear a facemask outside the home. Masks should completely cover your nose and mouth. Maintain social distancing. Stay at least 6 feet from others when outside the home. Keep your hands clean. Wash your hands often with soap and water or use hand sanitizer. Cover your coughs and sneezes with your elbow or a tissue. Don't touch your face. Keep hands away from your eyes, nose, and mouth. Stay home if you feel sick. Call your provider immediately if you experience any symptoms of COVID-19 or have had close exposure to someone who has recently tested positive for COVID-19.

For more information, review the CDC's recommendations HEREMake sure your facemask completely covers your nose and mouth and is secured snugly under your chin. Don't touch the outside of your mask while you are wearing it.THE RIGHT WAY THE WRONG WAY Wash your hands before you put on, and after you take off, your mask.Don't reuse disposable masks. Throw away after single use. Touch only the ties or ear loops when putting on or taking off your facemask.Don't wear a mask that's too loose or slides down your face. If your mask has a metal wire running along the top edge, mold it over the bridge of your nose to help contain droplets. Don't lower your mask so you can talk. Launder your cloth facemask between uses, especially when visibly soiled.Don't rest your mask around your neck or under your chin. Store masks in a clean environment. Don't hang your mask off your ear. Thank you Corporate Champion Sponsors in supporting APIC as INTERNATIONALneto conversation with an LAKSHMY MENON IS a public health-er with over 10 years of experience in infectious disease surveillance and epidemiol - ogy and measurement, evaluation, and learning (MEL). Prior to becoming an IP, Lakshmy worked towards tuberculosis elimination at the federal level. She also studied the durability of HIV treatments in real-world patient populations in Atlanta and identified and evaluated operational barriers to accessing reproductive health services at an urban HIV clinic in Kigali, Rwanda. Lakshmy graduated with a Master of Public Health degree in global health and infectious disease epidemiology from Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University. She loves her dog, knitting, yoga, and naps. What inspired you to become an infection preventionist? I did not know about the role until 2017. My master of public health (MPH) program was geared towards produc - ing graduates who worked in local, state, and federal govern - ment agencies, international development agencies, or at large NGOs. Even in the epidemiology department, there was not a focus on healthcare-associated infections (other than a case study about a hepatitis B outbreak in a dental practice in an ID Epidemiology elective that I took and loved). I was quite intrigued when in 2017, as I was re-entering the job market in the SF Bay Area, I kept seeing \"Infection Preventionist\" posts everywhere but found I did not meet the minimum require - ments of holding a nursing license or a CIC. Fast forward a few months: I was working as a community health programs specialist at a small hospital in the SF Bay Area, where my work experience in TB elimination led me to assisting the Medical Staff Office in performing annual TB screening of physi - cians and APPs. I was fortunate enough to have a wonderful Medical Director of IP\u2014Carol Kemper, MD, FIDSA\u2014whom I became friends with and who helped me understand that my background and training were an asset. Though I never got an interview in 2018 applying for more than 30 IP jobs in the Bay Area, I realized that other parts of the state had more multidisciplinary teams comprised of nurses, microbiologists, and public health-ers. I started aggressively networking to make connections in Southern California. What has helped you most as you have progressed in your role as an IP? What has helped me the most is having a network to reach out to\u2014I'm lucky to have an active local APIC chapter (Greater Los Angeles) with so many experienced IPs who care about developing those new to the field. I was also fortunate to be hired as an acute care IP by the then-President of the chapter. As a brand new IP, I was able to connect with other IPs very easily and start building a network I could reach out to for peer checks and guidance. I'm very aware of my good fortune as I know many of my colleagues are the sole IPs at their facility and may not have access to the same resources. This is why APIC is such a great resource; access to forums like IP Talk is very useful in getting guidance when you may not have any locally available. How has your background helped you in the IPC profession? I believe my background and experience has really been leading me to infection prevention my entire career. After graduate school, where I earned an MPH in global health and infectious disease epidemiology, I worked in monitoring and evaluating tuberculosis control programs at the federal level. This allowed me to understand how the public health system works in the United States as I consulted with state, county, and other local jurisdictions on measuring progress towards TB elimination. It also gave me a lot of experience with data analysis, certain laboratory topics (I started in TB as Cepheid's GeneXpert was being rolled out and the Qiagen's Quantiferon Gold was starting to replace tuberculin skin testing), surveil - lance systems, implementation science, and consultative rela - tionships. When I started as an IP in January 2019, I already had deep experience in the public health and epidemiology domains and did not need much supervision when working in these areas. My past work experience also gave me confidence that I was good at my job; prior to getting my current role (my first IP job) and even through my first year, I was convinced I was lacking as an IP because I was not a nurse. Having a public health background also allows me to see the local health depart - ment as a powerful ally in infection prevention. In addition, I'm able to bring the public health perspective into conversations that otherwise might lack it. While this year has been challeng - ing in many ways, my training and experience in public health allowed me to anticipate constantly changing federal guidelines and know what was coming, locally, in order to prepare our hospital for the pandemic. Why is obtaining (or maintaining) the CIC\u00ae credential important to you? I've started studying for my CIC, which I hope to obtain by spring 2021. When I was applying to IP jobs in 2018, I saw the CIC as my ticket to a job interview (when I felt dejected, I considered it a barrier to entry). Now, I consider it infection preventionist 18 | WINTER 2020 | Prevention important to earn, which is why I am devoting time and effort to obtain it. However, I have evolved in how I think about it. A CIC represents the expertise I bring to the field coupled with the experience I have gained so far as an IP. It provides reassur - ance to employers that I am competent. However, I think of it as a starting point for continuing to learn and develop as an IP. What is the best advice you ever received? The best advice I received was in graduate school: at every career fair, we were told it's all about networking. I networked to my IP job. Don't be afraid to \"cold\" message some - one on LinkedIn or email someone who is doing work that you want to do after you see their email address on a presentation. What advice do you have for others who are new to the field or considering the field of infection prevention and control? For those who are new to the field: it's all about relation - ships. Start cultivating relationships with everyone from day one. If your colleagues\u2014whether allied health, environmental services, nursing, security, or facilities\u2014see you as friendly and approachable, it's more likely that they will come to you with questions, concerns, and information that will make it easier for you to do your job. Know your content, yes; be comfortable saying \"I don't know.\" But the key to being an effective IP is having allies and internal support, which comes from building trusted relationships. How should we as a profession continue to build the IP pipeline? I think local APIC chapters are essential to bridging the gap that currently exists in recruiting, developing, and retaining IPs. Microbiologists and public health professionals are especially suited for the role of an IP. As a #publichealther, I realized that IPs got to do everything I loved about public health: health education, health communication, epidemiology, project management... the list goes on. I also found that I could make an impact on the public's health in ways that mattered in the hospital setting. We need to meet future IPs where they are at\u2014career fairs in undergraduate and graduate biology departments and public health departments. Those of us who fought to get to this job are excellent ambassadors for recruiting new IPs. I'd like to extend my gratitude to the IPs who have helped me get to where I am today: Cindy Park, Angela Vassallo, Catherine Nalesnik, Debesh Das, Jessica Rosende, and the #InfectionPreventionPosse on Twitter (special shout out to Alexander Sundermann!). 30 month shelf life; 180 days once opened Antimicrobial Catheter Exit Site, Skin and Wound Cleanser\u00ae100 year s of infect ion c ontr ol.

Beverly Burt: We all arrived April 1 and reported to Washington State Department of Health. My primary role differed slightly from Gwen and Nancy in that I was mostly working within the local jurisdiction of Public Health\u2014Seattle & King County. I recruited long-term care facilities (e.g., nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and adult family homes) to perform an infection prevention and control assessment and provide support. The assessments were performed onsite or CONSULTANT CORNER Addressing COVID-19 in Long-term Care Facilities A CONVERSATION WITH APIC CONSULTANTS GWEN BORLAUG, BEVERLY BURT, AND NANCY PARRIS via a televisit. Many of the facilities I was initially working with had COVID-19 outbreaks, which was challenging. We did not have the luxury of in-depth train - ing on guidelines since this was a novel virus and guidance was everchanging. I provided the facilities with the needed support while trying to stay up-to-date on current guidance in order to make relevant recommendations. Gwen Borlaug: When Nancy and I arrived, we were given a list of facili - ties that needed tele-Infection Control Assessment and Response (ICARs) assess - ments, and these long-term care facilities (LTCFs) were selected by the department of health ahead of time based on their own priority evaluation. We then wrote up reports for the LTCFs, which included resources and evidence-based recommen - dations. One of the best outcomes from this process was showing the LTCFs, if they did not already know, that their state department of health is an excellent public health partner and resource that is avail - able to them in times of need. Nancy Parris: Initially, I was tasked with traveling around the state to do in-person assessments with nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and even independent living facilities as the need arose. Gwen and I made it a priority to collaborate with the local health depart - ments to ensure guidance was consistent Gwen Borlaug, MPH, CIC, FAPIC, is retired from the Wisconsin Division of Public Health, where she served as the Director of the Healthcare-Associated Infection Prevention Program. During her tenure she conducted onsite visits/ evaluations to hospitals and long-term care facilities and provided outbreak management support. Gwen is cur - rently an independent infection preven - tion consultant and has recently worked with the Washington State Department of Health and the Texas Department of State Health Services, on behalf of APIC Consulting Services, to evaluate COVID-19 readiness and response in long-term care facilities, skilled nursing facilities, and assisted living facilities. Beverly Bailey Burt, RN, BSN, CIC, has served in the role of infection preventionist for the past 33 years, primarily at acute care facili - ties. She also assisted with the development of test questions for the CBIC exam during her time on the CBIC Test Committee. In 2014, Beverly began her own infection pre - vention consulting company. She has worked as an infection prevention consultant for Mississippi State Department of Health; The Mississippi Public Health Institute; Mississippi Hospital Association Health, Research, and Educational Foundation, Inc.; and APIC Consulting Services. Currently, through APIC Consulting, Beverly is working for the Washington State Department of Health to provide COVID-19 infection prevention con - sultative services to long-term care facilities. Nancy Parris, RN, BSN, PHN, RHIA, MPH, CIC, CPHQ, FAPIC, has worked in the field for over 40 years in acute, long-term, and ambulatory care and has been an active member and leader in APIC. She has been an invited guest speaker at national and international professional con - ferences and has participated in research studies, published articles, and authored book chapters. She has lobbied Congress, California Health and Labor Committee, and the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) for regulatory changes affecting healthcare practices. Nancy is committed to providing quality education and training for infection preventionists and helping to bridge the gap in the continuum of care between healthcare settings. 20 | WINTER 2020 | Prevention across the board. Eventually, we were a presence in adult family homes as well. A takeaway for me was that everyone across the country was building the plane while they were flying it, so to speak, but only in looking back have I realized just how seamlessly Washington Department of Health coordinated their efforts. They were a well-oiled machine! Beverly mentioned the challenge of frequently changing CDC guidance. How did that affect your work with the state health department and individual facilities? Nancy: It was tough, and it remains tough! Gwen: Yes, that was probably one of our main support roles. Infection preventionists (IPs) really didn't have the time necessary to stay completely up to date on the guide - lines and recommendations coming out of national and state sources. A critical role for us was to track these updates, communi - cate them to facilities, and then help them interpret the changes in a timely manner. Beverly: The Washington State Department of Health organized a brief huddle every morning, Monday through Friday, for the IP, which was incredibly helpful. It gave us the opportunity to dis - cuss changes in guidelines on a regular basis so we could offer uniform interpreta - tions across the board. The IP team was amazing to work with! Nancy: Another observation I wanted to throw in was how collaborative the state department of health was with other agencies. On Mother's Day\u2014a Sunday\u2014I got a call from an adult family home that had several buildings experiencing an outbreak. They needed to transfer residents to a different location in order to safely manage the outbreak, but the effort required a collaboration between the Washington State Department of Health, Washington State Department of Social and Health Services, and the local public health jurisdiction. Ultimately, we were able to get the residents transferred in a timely manner, and it became a real example of efficient intragovernmental cooperation during a crisis.and help them; they became one of the best-prepared facilities. Nancy: Something I have observed during the pandemic is that the staff at skilled nursing facilities have truly been vilified, which has been unconscionable. Where hospitals have heroes, nursing homes have villains. These are some of the hardest working people, and they love their residents; they, too, are our heroes. When residents pass away, staff feel the loss deeply. I don't think this is well understood by the media or the public. We absolutely need to support the IPs in LTCFs. For the most part, they haven't received the same training. They are building their knowledge base, and they need our support. What do you think LTCFs need right now from IPC as we move into this next phase of COVID-19? Nancy: Support and education. One of the challenges for LTC IPs is the bar - rier to resources. We hear that these IPs are unable to network and that there is a lack of recognition within LTCFs. We need to ensure LTCFs understand APIC's role as an organization in helping their IPs and understand that the IPC field requires continued learning, not a one-off training. Gwen: They need time. I would ask the IPs in LTCFs, \"How many hours are you\u2014as an IP\u2014able to work on IPC?\" Typically, the answer is just a few hours a week, but they need to focus on it full-time. IPs need time to train staff, do surveillance, analyze facility data, and develop procedures. Time, time, time is what they need. Beverly: I found that a major gap at LTCFs was education/training in the role of the IP. Some IPs were new to the role which was challenging when dealing with a novel virus. These IPs need continual support and resources, especially when dealing with a novel virus. For more information about working with APIC Consulting Services, please contact Leslie Kretzu at 202-454-2611 or lkretzu@apic.org .Was there anything that surprised you when you arrived at these LTCFs? Beverly: The lack of PPE in the long-term care facilities was concerning. Some of the facilities had outbreaks early on, which meant that by April it was dif - ficult to obtain the supplies they needed. Alcohol-based hand sanitizer was also dif - ficult to acquire. The situation is much better now, but at the time we were making recommendations for supplies that were sometimes difficult to procure. Nancy: And the situation was different depending on where in the state you were. One area might have plenty of respirators but no gowns, while another part of the state would be experiencing the opposite. Without proper supplies, we saw health - care personnel having to get creative, and then us having to gauge the safety of their workarounds. Gwen: It was surprising to see how local and state officials had to struggle to manage the shortage of PPE supplies, even after years of planning and preparing for a pandemic event. The situation was just so overwhelming. What was your experience with staff members at these facilities? Beverly: The staff were great to work with and were hungry for the knowledge and expertise. Any tools and resources we could provide, they would happily receive! Gwen: Because these LTCFs were really the first hit in the U.S., they became an easy target in the media when the outbreaks got worse and the numbers climbed. I spent a lot of time with an 'infamous' facility that was in the news. I did a full IPC evaluation and went back and did a tracer\u2014in other words, how did they set up their COVID-19 unit, beginning to end. Speaking with the staff in that facility was the heart - breaking part. So many were experiencing post-traumatic stress syndrome from the whole ordeal. They were sending their residents out to the hospital, never expect - ing it would be the last time they would see residents.

From healthcare to education to politics to the way we spend our time and spend time with each other, the world has, in a matter of months, become a very different place. This is especially true for infec - tion preventionists (IPs), who continue to battle a pandemic that shows no sign of ending before the calendar flips. In a particularly challenging year, the APIC Text had some clear victories. We provided thousands of IPs with free access to some of our most crucial chapters related to COVID-19 for several months, regardless of their APIC membership sta - tus. Though our clinical editors were busier than ever with their full-time jobs, we published several fully revised chapters and updated additional chapters with critical COVID-19 information. In November, we delivered a brand-new chapter dedicated to COVID-19, writ - ten by Ericka Kalp and her colleagues from the Pennsylvania Department of Health. It is an incredible resource, and if you haven't read it, I encourage you to visit text.apic.org to check it out (a subscription is required, but if you're not a subscriber, you can read the abstract for free). Due in no small part to the hard work of our editors and authors, our readership numbers are higher than ever, with the APIC Text chapters taking in more than 35,000 page views each month this year. Looking to 2021, the APIC Text will be working doubly hard to bring IPs the con - tent they need to prosper in this evolving landscape. We've amped up our editorial team to include several new associate sec - tion editors, who will help us deliver more frequent and high-quality chapter updates throughout the year (see sidebar). The additional team members are certified, practicing IPs from around the country, with varying levels of experience in vary - ing environments, who've demonstrated a Challenges and victories in a remarkable year BY RAQUEL WOJNAR true dedication to the field, a sharp edito - rial eye, and a commitment to delivering content that is practical, relevant, and meaningful to our readership. They'll be working alongside our veteran group of clinical editors and our fantastic pool of authors to meet our goal of updating all 125 chapters of content over the next couple of years.A new year won't erase all the chal - lenges of the old, and meeting our goals will not be easy, but we are fortunate to serve a community that continually inspires us with their incredible work ethic and unflagging optimism. Here's to a brighter future, together.

At the time of this writing, millions have been infected and hundreds of thousands have died due to COVID-19. Unfortunately, the virus's rapid spread caught many facilities off guard and highlighted deficiencies in our healthcare sys - tem. From supply chain issues to lapses in infection control policies in under-resourced settings, the U.S. healthcare system's vulnerabil - ity has been exposed. APIC plans to be a leading voice for long-term care facilities as lawmakers look for ways to reinforce the U.S. health - care system while it continues to battle COVID-19 and prepare for the next pandemic.CAPITOL COMMENTS Long-term care during COVID-19 and beyond BY LISA TOMLINSON, NANCY HAILPERN, RICHARD CAPPARELL, AND ABIGAIL RICHARDS Environment of nursing homes and skilled-nursing facilities While most acute care facilities have estab - lished infection control programs, the same cannot be said about most nursing homes and skilled-nursing facilities (SNFs). Federal regulations require these facilities to have an infection control plan; however, it was only recently required that they employ an infec - tion preventionist (IP) who would be onsite, at least part time. Unfortunately, the role of an IP was often given to an individual who held many different roles within the facility. This challenge was highlighted in an AJIC article1 that explored how the time of IPs in nursing homes was spent. The article states, \"Nursing homes have, on average, 0.32 infec - tion preventionist full-time equivalents on staff.\" This makes it nearly impossible for these individuals to give infection prevention and control the time and focus it requires to keep patients and staff safe. Additionally, the qualifications needed to be an IP working in a nursing home or SNF largely depend on the state. There is limited federal regulatory language on the qualifications needed to fill this role. Although infection prevention and con - trol training is required, certification is not (see sidebar). However, in practice, qualifications for being an IP in a nursing home or SNF can be interpreted by facili - ties to their lowest common denominator. Finally, to further complicate establishing infection prevention protocols, there is often high staff turnover at these facilities. A 2009 study from the American Public Health Association cites nursing home retention problems back to the 1970s. T urnover rates of 55 percent to 100 percent were 24 | WINTER 2020 | Prevention documented for registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, and certified nursing assis - tants. This lack of institutional memory makes maintaining infection prevention practices difficult as staff are constantly roll - ing in and out of a facility. This is magnified for facilities that do not have an IP onsite to constantly reinforce proper practices. COVID-19 impact Unfortunately, this inadequate infection prevention situation created the circum - stances we are seeing in nursing homes and SNFs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of already existing comorbidities, residents of long-term care facilities are more susceptible to serious complications of COVID-19 infection. And because the facilities are the primary residence for many in their care, it is difficult to isolate and contain the virus once it is present in the facility. Without strong infection prevention processes, LTC residents are at the highest risk for the worst outcomes. According to a New York Times article,2 \"While 6 percent of the country's cases have occurred in long-term care facili - ties, deaths related to COVID-19 in these facilities account for about 38 percent of the country's pandemic fatalities.\" Further, the impact of COVID-19 was felt even more in areas with large minority populations. A CNN article 3 highlighted this issue, as nursing homes with higher populations of racial/ethnic minorities have two to four times as many COVID-19 cases as their counterparts with lower minority populations. Additionally, a Washington Post analysis4 of data found that the death rate was more than 20 percent higher in majority Black facilities compared with majority white facilities. In addition to residents becoming ill, staff are also becoming infected with COVID-19. According to the National Nurses Union, more than 1,700 health - care workers have died because of the virus. Combine that with workers who are taking time off for mental health reasons or to recover from the illness, and you can see the recipe for a strained workforce. A Health Affairs study 5 showed more than one-fifth of nursing homes were reporting staff shortages. These shortages make it more difficult to adhere to proper infec - tion prevention and control practices, as staff are forced to cut corners. APIC policy recommendations As the premier organization of infec - tion preventionists, APIC is working on legislative and regulatory proposals that will improve the safety and quality of patient care during COVID-19 and future pandemics. Historically, infection control measures have been described by some as regulatory burdens or have been discounted as a discretionary, rather than necessary, part of patient treatment. This pandemic has highlighted the need for dynamic and pro-active infection preven - tion and control programs. While APIC supported the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid's regulations requiring that nursing homes and SNFs have at a minimum a part-time IP on premises and for an annual risk assess - ment, the time has come to consider the next step for infection control in these facilities. APIC is now encouraging poli - cymakers to require that nursing homes have a minimum of one full-time certified employee dedicated to the role of infection preventionist. The need for qualified and accessible infection prevention staff can no longer be put off because of cost or inconvenience. Residents and staff are suffering from inad - equate infection control programs and it is time for policymakers to take action.

By studying and learning from outbreaks in the LTC/behavioral health setting, infection preventionists (IPs) can glean additional knowledge and apply this information to hopefully prevent future infections and infection clusters in their facilities. This quarterly column helps the IP heighten awareness of appropriate interventions to prevent outbreaks. One isolate was obtained from one patient's abscess. The second isolate was identified in a second patient's blood, and the organism was identified in a third patient's blood and urine. The patients were all male, and greater than 60 years, and either bedrid - den or immunocompromised. The authors1 were concerned this bacterium may have persisted in the nursing home and caused infection due to inadequate infection preven - tion interventions in a vulnerable nursing home population. Based upon your clinical acumen, you suspect the pathogen to Cryptococcus neoformans Two of the patients were cultured on admission to the nursing home. All cultures grew Providencia stuartii, a gram-negative bacillus (rod-shaped) bacterium in the Enterobacteriaceae family. Various antimi - crobial-resistant genes were identified among the isolates. Pulse-field gel electrophoresis analysis revealed the isolates were genetically different. All three patients were success - fully treated with last-line antibiotics and discharged. The genus Providencia was first described by Stuart and coauthors in 1943.2 It contains five species, with P. stuartii and P. rettgeri being the most likely to cause nosocomial infections.3 P. stuartii is normally found in the gas - trointestinal tract, water, and soil.4,5 It can Mao et al1 reviewed three LTC facility residents who became hospitalized during a 15-month period with infection from an opportunistic micro-organism. This pathogen survives well in the natural environment and may also be found in the healthcare setting in handwashing sinks or other areas. It is naturally resistant to multiple antibiotics.1Identify the pathogen!CDC Figure 1. Providencia stuartii. 26 | WINTER 2020 | Prevention also contaminate environmental surfaces in healthcare settings.5 Hospitalized patients and healthcare personnel can become colo - nized on the skin and on respiratory mucosa and transmit the bacteria to others.5 Seriously debilitated individuals are at greatest risk for P. stuartii infection,4 and healthcare outbreaks have been previ - ously reported in the intensive care units.6 Susceptibility is not known to vary by sex or race.7 Infection can occur in the urinary tract, respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract (after traveling to developing countries), blood, and several other normally sterile sites.4,5 Molecules from certain P. stuartii strains can bind to urinary catheters, putting LTC residents with indwelling urinary devices at risk for infection.7,8 P. stuartii septicemia primarily stems from the urinary tract and can result in sepsis, renal failure, pneumonia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome. The Providencia bacte - remia mortality can range from 6 percent to 33 percent.7 Infection signs and symptoms are typical for the body site. For example, a patient with a urinary tract infection may present with dysuria, hematuria, fever, and chills, and a patient with a pneumonia may present with cough, fever, and chills. P. stuartii has been associated with the onset of \"purple urine bag syndrome,\" a harmless condition in which urine collected after urinary cath - eterization is purple in the bag.9 To diagnose infection, a gram stain and culture are obtained from the suspected site of infection. A urinalysis and urine culture are obtained when a urinary tract infec - tion is suspected. A complete blood count is used to monitor for leukocytosis, and a chemistry panel is obtained to monitor renal and liver function. P. stuartii is often resis - tant to multiple antibiot - ics, and therapy is guided by susceptibility test - ing. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) P. stuartii is an increasing problem in hospitalized patients.7 Carbapenem resistance is of great con - cern because these bacteria are intrinsically resistant to polymyxins and - cline, which RN, MPH, MSN, CIC, FSHEA, FAPIC, is an infection prevention con - sultant with a specialized inter - est in acute care/long-term care/ behavioral health/ambulatory care infection prevention chal - 1.

CASE REPORT: PURPLE URINE BAG SYNDROME IN WOMAN NEUROGENIC BLADDER 27 PREVENTION IN ACTIONProfessional Development and Professional Stewardship during a pandemic The APIC Professional Development Committee members have focused this article on selected lessons learned so far during the COVID-19 pandemic that relate to the APIC Competency Model future-oriented competency domain Professional Stewardship. In addition to look - ing at the six subdomains of Professional Stewardship\u2014accountability, ethics, financial acumen, population health, continuum of care, and advocacy\u2014the article includes quotes from infection preventionist (IP) committee members and chapter leaders who were surveyed on professional stewardship and professional development issues related to the pandemic. hile pandemic plan - ning and response to emerging pathogens has been within the scope of the contemporary IP for more than a decade, nothing could fully prepare IPs for the coronavi - rus. Throughout the pan - demic, IPs have been and continue to be highly sought after to assist in deci - sion making, to develop policies and procedures where none exist, and to lead the infec - tion preven - tion and control (IPC) response regardless of the experience level and healthcare setting in which they work. IPs are constantly challenged to meet immediate demands as well as prepare for the future. The IPC profession is changing rapidly, and the professional com - petencies required for success are expanding beyond what has been experienced in prior years. The COVID-19 pandemic has been no exception. The APIC Competency Model's future-oriented com - petency domain, Professional Stewardship, and its subdomains, illustrate the impact of the pan - demic on IPs and the IPC profession. An August 2020 survey gathered information from APIC committee members and chapter leaders on the impact of the COVID- 19 pandemic on practicing IPs. Quotes from that survey are provided under each subdomain to represent actual experiences that have impacted professional development during this global emergency.W 28 | WINTER 2020 | Prevention Accountability CHRISTINE ZIRGES, MSN(R), APRN-BC, CIC, FAPIC The professional stewardship subdomain of accountability underscores the need and ability to adjust to the ever-changing health - care landscape. Accountability calls for the IP to demonstrate a consistent and high-level approach to dependability in a dynamic work environment. This includes the abil - ity to navigate their respective work setting to optimize evidence-based practice (EBP), including the implementation and sustain - ment of new guidelines. Accountability tran - scends across the healthcare setting with the aim to protect healthcare personnel (HCPs), visitors, residents, and patients by mitigating the risk of infection. One example where little or no prior evidence exists to assist the IP in decision making is regarding extended and re-use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Accountability is necessary when collaborating with HCPs in other disciplines in order to create new prac - tice and policy under unique circumstances, such as a pandemic. Accountability to self, the organization, and to the profession requires the ability to determine when a situation involves deviation from established IPC practices. Accountability takes another form when leading the COVID-19 pandemic response in one's respective practice set - tings. Facilitation skills are necessary for both building relationships among HCPs and for implementing changes to existing IPC strategies. It is okay not to know all the answers; the accountability subdomain of professional stewardship illustrates the need to exhibit inquiry, collaboration, and adjust routines and procedures not only in a day-to-day practice but in a crisis state. VOICES FROM THE FIELD \"As I have always prided myself on leaning heavily on the evidence and being careful to not make strong recommendations when evidence is lacking, this pandemic has put me out of my comfort zone. Oftentimes there has not been the evidence to sup - port recommendations and decisions that need to be made. We are often left with selecting the best course of action given limited evidence and the need to take into account resource limitations. This has been difficult for many of us from an accountability and ethical perspective but necessary, given we often have more knowledge and background to make the 'best' decisions given the circumstances.\" VOICES FROM THE FIELD \"Half of my IPs quit on my team. The work was overwhelming and the stress neverending. We were hard-hit by COVID-19. At that time, PPE was very scarce, and we were not sure if it was airborne or droplet. Hospital staff members were scared. Lots of information was coming out by non-credible sources that just complicated our work and made things worse not better. Everyone felt like they had read the 'real' true information, but it wasn't what we were putting out as best practice from WHO and CDC. I had not been at the facility very long, so my credibility wasn't proven yet. It was chaos and painful.\" Ethics LAURA BUFORD, RN, MSN, CIC The Ethics subdomain of the APIC Competency Model has been challenged during the COVID-19 pandemic. Safety of HCPs, visitors, residents, and patients is the main goal of IPs. However, our ability to attain that goal has been tested. Our ethical standards have been strained with inconsistent access to IPC support in many facilities including long-term acute care (LTACs) and long-term care (LTC). Distribution of testing, unclear informa - tion and guidance, and the significant dangers to HCPs, visitors, residents, and patients during a pandemic place addi - tional strain on the ethical approaches to IPs' practice. As with any novel infectious disease, the longer it remains in circulation, the more we learn. This was especially the case in the realm of PPE. The initial issues were determining which PPE was appropriate. Masking recommendations changed many times and have made HCPs question if they were being kept safe. To compound the confusion of what PPE to wear, IPs had to consider and implement extended use of PPE. Standard practice is to change PPE between every patient. However, supply shortages were already occurring months before the global pandemic reached the United States. Therefore, adoption of CDC strategy to optimize the supply of PPE became critical to prevent running out of PPE altogether. Determining how to safely reuse PPE was a huge ethical dilemma for IPs. PPE procedures and plans are based on EBP, but IPs were forced to rethink these rules and develop safe ways to accommodate the reality of the situation. Times have called for a reset - ting of ethical standards in IPC in the hopes of surviving a pandemic, practicing safely, and returning to some sense of normalcy. VOICES FROM THE FIELD \"Early in the pandemic, there was a push to con - vert procedural areas to negative pressure and entire units, not just rooms, to negative pres - sure. Hospital leaders were asking facilities if it was possible to switch procedure areas and units to negative pressure, and facilities did say it was possible. I was able to explain the negative aspects of this type of activity and get leadership to understand that IPC professionals need to be involved in these types of decisions and why. This required professional conduct to advocate for qual - ity and safety for all residents/patients and staff as well as collaboration with various leaders in the impacted areas.\" Financial Acumen HEATHER BERNARD, DNP, RN, CIC, FAPIC ANGEL MUELLER, MPH, CIC, FAPIC Fiscal responsibility has been extremely challenging during the COVID-19 pan - demic as routine products have increased in price or may not even be available. During a pandemic, it is particularly important for IPs to have knowledge, skills, and ability defined within the financial acumen sub - domain. As healthcare facilities pause or cease revenue generating services, IPs have the added conundrum of implementing new programs, practices, and products to ensure safe care delivery in a financially restricted environment. It has been particularly important to ensure ongoing and continuous communi - cation with decision makers regarding IPC program efforts. Doing so requires a delicate www.apic.org | 29 PREVENTION IN ACTIONbalance of established needs, cost, and impact of activities to ensure safe delivery of care to infectious residents and patients. Price gouging of PPE and limited availability of products has made this incredibly chal - lenging during the COVID-19 pandemic. Making the business case to decision makers when implementing initiatives and support - ing the role of the IPC department while balancing cost can result in enhanced HCP, visitor, resident, and patient safety as well as reduce overall risk to the facility. IPs must account for and track activities related to COVID-19 preparation, plan - ning, mitigation, and response to establish the foundation for any opportunity to receive federal funds or grant funding that could assist with recovery efforts. In being good stewards of resources, it is more important than ever for IPs to be able to balance the needs with the resources, while implementing initiatives that improve safe delivery of care. VOICES FROM THE FIELD \"For the continuum of care, we struggled with limited testing being available, yet all LTC facilities are requiring two negative tests for every admit. We also had to develop protocols for reusing face masks to retain some PPE supply. This was so foreign to all of us and was a very difficult strategy to implement and get staff buy in.\" Population Health CHAZ RHONE, MPH, CIC, FAPIC Now more than ever, COVID-19 has reinforced the importance of the IP role in population health, specifically, familiarity with the local community served by a facil - ity, awareness of other healthcare facilities in the area, and the public health data sur - rounding COVID-19 cases. Typically, local population health concerns are assessed as a part of the annual risk assessment pro - cess. However, in the midst of this public health crisis, these considerations have to be made on a more frequent basis as the situation evolves. IPs, along with other deci - sion makers, have relied on this data to help develop operational guidance for their facili - ties, including surge planning, temporary suspension of elective services, rationing of resources, and visitation policies. These considerations allow facilities to be better prepared to serve their communities. Additionally, with the movement of resi - dents or patients throughout the continuum of care, IPs are finding themselves with multiple responsibilities, including reporting to local health departments, identifying clusters, and involvement in delayed discharges of residents or patients when transferred to other facilities. None of these population health-related tasks are new to the IP, but the frequency and vol - ume of cases due to COVID-19 certainly are. Although IPC resources are being stretched beyond capacity, established relationships with other healthcare entities are imperative during this time and will enable us to get through this crisis together. VOICES FROM THE FIELD \"The COVID-19 pandemic has granted all IPs an opportunity to expand our influence and advocate for IPC best practices, our profession, and our IP colleagues. The pandemic has shown that this doesn't just apply to healthcare settings, but that our knowledge, expertise, and influence is appli - cable to every aspect of daily life.\" Continuum of Care ANIECA ASHLEY, RN, BSN, CIC The Continuum of Care subdomain of the APIC Competency Model has been a center focus since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Alternatives to tra - ditional infection prevention standards have been developed across the continuum of care throughout the pandemic. COVID-19 is a novel disease. Health experts knew nothing about it. It certainly did not come with an instruction manual to describe all of the twists and turns of this disease nor how to control the disease. COVID-19 has instilled fear into millions; the fear of not knowing the truth and an exaggeration of the disease process by the media and armchair experts. Fear certainly has had an impact on the continuum of care and the disruption of care through multiple types of health services. Many healthcare sys - tems have various processes in place that are not standardized, including, but not limited to testing and discharge protocols. Hospital beds are occupied with patients in this latter category who need no medical care but can - not go home, yet there are those who are critically ill with no beds or staff to care for them. Many hospitals have been at capacity, and the ability to transfer a patient for care has been challenging. Never has there been a more critical time than now for IP collaboration from all areas of healthcare. The need for education based on truth and scientific facts must be shared by IPs among all settings. The experienced IP must take these valuable opportunities to pay it forward to less experienced IPs. Rather than organizations with limited IP resources simply stating that they are unable to accept COVID-19 positive or exposed residents/patients due to the risk of an out - break, networking can promote discussion on how to mitigate that risk. This includes developing alternative ways to establish the continuum of care networks, share IPC best practices, provide safe and appropriate care for residents/patients, educate families to ease their worries, and ask that the IPs stand together and lead the way for a safer provi - sion of care. Continuum of Care LINDA BEHAN, CIC The COVID-19 pandemic has certainly challenged LTC facilities due to early and continued inadequacy in resources, particu - larly PPE and testing availability, accept - able test results, and turnaround times. LTC facilities can still expect that screening test results\u2014from tests administered to identify asymptomatic infected staff and residents or patients so that they can properly cohort\u2014 will take variable amounts of time. Because PPE supply chains are still unreli - able, most LTC facilities continue, by neces - sity, to operate with crisis or contingency PPE strategies as defined by the CDC. Staffing shortages during outbreaks have been difficult, and lack of or conflicting guidance have hampered a unified, evi - dence-based approach to pandemic manage - ment. However, throughout the pandemic the IPs in LTC facilities guide the interpro - fessional team through risk assessment and reduction, proper use of PPE, safely creating cohorts among residents, and attention to environmental disinfection. 30 | WINTER 2020 | Prevention IPs are learning, as a team, how to better apply outbreak management principles to minimize the number of residents or patients affected. The pandemic has reinforced the concept of \"it takes a village\" both inside and outside of a facility to care for our frail and vulnerable populations. In response to our acute care partners' surge capacity pressures and to avoid the introduction of COVID-19 into a na\u00efve LTC facility, implementation of COVID-19-positive designated facilities has taken place. This allowed admission of hos - pitalized residents or patients who required transmission-based precautions and helped to relieve the strain on the healthcare system. LTC is and will continue to be an important part of the healthcare continuum. The pan - demic has spotlighted the need for robust, cross-learning opportunities from acute care to post-acute care (PAC) and from PAC to acute care. VOICES FROM THE FIELD \"An experience that has been particularly powerful or insightful for me during this pandemic related to the continuum of care is more collaboration with LTC and acute care, and better hand-off and communication between agencies.\"Advocacy MACKENZIE WEISE, MPH, CIC APIC's Professional Stewardship future-ori - ented competency domain helps to prepare dedicated IP stewards that will allow the profes - sion to develop, adjust, and uphold a respect - able and reliable reputation. As part of this, we are called to become advocates who can: a) Remain updated and informed about polit - ical and regulatory landscapes and priorities b) Communicate the critically important role that IPs play across the continuum of care c) Inform and educate policymakers and regulatory agencies on evidence-based IPC practices that protect HCPs, visitors, residents, and patients from infection d) Maintain vigilance for emerging issues where policymakers and the public are getting the facts wrong e) Practice persuasive reasoning while iden - tifying what resonates with the audience Many of us are no strangers to what IP advocacy looks like within healthcare facilities; however, most IPs are not regu - larly exposed to the diverse array of local, regional, state, or national media outlets. The COVID-19 pandemic has rocket-launched many IPs out of their comfort zones and into the front of microphones and cameras. VOICES FROM THE FIELD \"The COVID-19 pandemic opened up an opportu - nity for infection prevention to be recognized and relied upon as an area of expertise at the corporate level of our health system. I was chosen to serve as the infection preventionist on our system-wide Incident Command. This was an immensely posi - tive experience that allowed me to develop my leadership capabilities on a much larger level, rely upon my IPC knowledge, and to grow my profes - sional stewardship competencies by serving as an IPC expert and advocate at the highest level of my organization.\" The following PDC members contributed to this Chaz Zirges, MSN(R), APRN-BC, CIC, FAPIC SIX LESSONS-LEARNED FROM EXPERIENCE SERVING AS AN IP ADVOCATE IN THE MEDIA: 1. Consult with your leadership and connect with internal marketing and/or public relations colleagues for support. These professionals can help you prepare as well as help you remain protected. 2. Research the media outlet as well as the requestor to pri - oritize exactly how messaging should be tailored. Do they have specific political agendas or affiliations? Are there any special interests that you should be prepared for? Who is their target market, AKA what type of people con - sume their work? Does the interviewer or point of contact have any previous work that you can review? 3. Identify the exact media request, identify the exact output that is planned, and prepare your professional responses and thoughts in advance. Some media outlets may provide their questions ahead of time. This is a best-case scenario from a preparatory perspective. If it's not possible to get questions ahead of time, try to identify exactly where their interests lie as well as the general scope of questions that they're anticipating.4. Identify the \"goal\" message that you need to convey as an IP advocate related to the topic at hand and tailor that message to the target audience. Always remember that the goal of health communication is to inform and influence decisions and actions that improve health outcomes. 5. During your actual interaction with the media: a. Acknowledge each question and clearly communicate your (pre-planned) responses. b. Use bridging techniques if the conversation begins to veer off topic. Examples can include: i. \"However...\" ii. \"The real issue is\" iii. \"Let's put that in perspective\" iv. \"If you look closer\" v. \"That's one way to look at it, but\" c. Be sure to convey your goal message (from #4) before the interaction concludes. 6. Lastly, it's OK to decline. After completing steps 1-3, you may decide that the media request is inappropriate, a poor use of resources, unneces - sary, or just plain shady. If this occurs, you should never feel forced to put yourself or your company in an uncomfortable or unwanted position. www.apic.org | 31 PREVENTION IN ACTIONAccountability, values, and patient safety: To err is human, but it's also a learning opportunity. In a Just Culture environment, an individual is held accountable for their actions, but management will share in that accountability. Blame is replaced with examining the cause for the error, leading to reprioritized values and improvements in teamwork. It can also lead to coaching and training opportunities to prevent future at-risk behaviors. And it can expose inefficient processes and unorganized workflows that interfere with patient safety and quality of care. But what does a Just Culture in a health - care setting look like, and how does it get implemented? Kelly Romano, BS, MPH, CIC, of Einstein Medical Center Montgomery shares her Just Culture experiences with Prevention Strategist below. HOW DID YOU FIRST LEARN ABOUT JUST CULTURE? WHAT HAS IT MEANT TO YOU, AT YOUR INSTITUTION? I first learned about Just Culture through a risk management colleague of mine who suggested that I look into the strategy as a Patient Safety Initiative. We worked through a meeting with the leading company, who keyed the term Just Culture, and discussed what Just Culture truly meant. After several meetings and gathering thoughts about how this could impact patient safety and care at our institu - tion, we introduced the theory to our senior leaders. The leadership was skeptical at first, but we were a young hospital, had opened in September 2012, and decided that we were in a good place with the staff to be able to start our journey. We were only three years into patient care at our location and the staff were becoming comfortable with discussing errors and safety events with the leadership team.It's 'Just Culture': HOW WAS INFECTION PREVENTION INVOLVED? WHAT ROLE DID YOU PLAY? Well, I somewhat fell into the project. I am also the Patient Safety Officer in the institution. However, in a Just Culture institution you will come to find that staff become comfortable with discussing events that occur and developing solutions to cre - ate a safe environment for the patients. Healthcare staff want to help people, this is why they are in healthcare. When they know that they can safely discuss their errors or workflows that they see may have the potential to cause harm, without being judged or blamed, they will do that. We like to have those one-on-one discussions, sometimes at the bedside, so that those small changes can prevent harm in the future. These theories are things we do daily that we don't even recognize we do. It is just helpful to have a structure, lan - guage, and education to go along with it. This is what helps the staff to understand the \"why\" behind our constant questions surrounding events. The questioning is not meant for blame, but rather help prevent the next error or harmful event. The staff can also feel a sense of relief when they know they have been able to make the HOW WAS JUST CULTURE IMPLEMENTED AT YOUR INSTITUTION? WHO LED THE INITIATIVE? The initiative was led by myself and a core team which included: Chief Operating Officer, Chief Nursing Officer, Vice President of Healthcare Services, Chief Medical Officer, Vice President of Human Resources, Nursing Education, Risk Management, Director of Quality Improvement, Office of Professional Development, and Director of Quality Improvement for our offsite practices. This team completed a full four-day training to become certified in Just Culture. Once the training was completed, we gathered several smaller teams, consisting of the members above, to address our needs to move forward with the initiative. The smaller subcommittees included: policies, materials, education, and implementa - tion timeline. Our larger group met twice per month to review progress until we were ready to train staff members. The training process took a lot of thought and started from the top down. We still present scenarios to our department direc - tors monthly so that they can continu - ally review the process.An interview with Kelly Romano Just Culturerisk managementblamesupportimprovementsworkflows initiativehuman error accountabilitysupportquestioning teamwork valuesstaff engagement leadership buy-inBY THE PREVENTION STRATEGIST EDITORIAL PANEL 32 | WINTER 2020 | Prevention changes happen. Therefore, it is also very helpful that your senior leaders are well versed in Just Culture and support your efforts. When they go to the front lines and make rounds, the staff are willing to discuss events or needed changes with them as well. All staff feel comfortable with the senior leaders. CAN YOU GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THE IPC DEPARTMENT USED JUST CULTURE TO MAKE A CHANGE, AND/OR HOW JUST CULTURE IMPACTED IPC PROGRAMS? When we started our Catheter-associated Urinary Tract Infection (CAUTI) team we had some difficulty securing staff interest. We really had to encourage staff that this team would not take a lot of their time and that their input was important to us. We identified key individuals from multiple departments: nursing, leadership, wound ostomy continence, therapies, transport, and environmental services. When we dis - cussed the concerns and bundles with the staff and explained the \"why,\" they became more interested. Staff started to open up about common practices that either they saw or had done themselves. This led to an honest, open-ended discussion to identify things that we, as Infection Prevention, didn't even know was happening. We used Just Culture language, like Human Error or At-Risk Behavior, to describe and categorize how to ultimately change those types of behaviors. Human errors can happen to any - one. People are not infallible, and you can't remove people from healthcare. How do we create systems that are designed to help healthcare workers rather than designed for failure? We need to begin to see that adding steps and layers to processes are not always helpful and may make the task of prevent - ing infections much harder, and easier to make mistakes. WHAT WERE THE DIFFICULTIES, IF ANY, IN GETTING UPPER MANAGEMENT BUY-IN? DID YOU HAVE DIFFICULTY GETTING THE HR DEPARTMENT INVOLVED? DID HR POLICIES CHANGE? Buy-in from leadership can be a challenge, especially when there is a cost involved. I find, again, that when you can explain the \"why\" behind the process it can be extremely helpful in selling your proposal. We used staff engagement, reduced harm scores, and reduced healthcare-associated conditions to market our theory. We also needed to explain that you may see an increase in safety events. Although the events will increase, the harm score decreases. This decrease is because more staff are reporting near-miss type of safety events. They want to talk about poten - tial failures in order to prevent harm from reaching the patient. Process improvement does not get much better than proactive discussions. Human Resources was involved from the start. There was some question about the process and accountability. When you work in a Just Culture you are not meant to have a completely non-punitive pro - cess. Just Culture is a way to hold people appropriately accountable. Accountability is determined by the type of human behav - ior. The type of behavior will determine the level of accountability for the staff member. Interestingly, our human resource policies were already in line with a Just Culture. We just needed to provide some leadership-level education and align what the leaders were already doing to the Just Culture language. DID THE PEOPLE IMPLEMENTING JUST CULTURE USE A FORMAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT PROCESS? IF SO, CAN YOU DESCRIBE? I wouldn't say that we labeled our process for change with a formal change manage - ment process. However, we did develop a timeline for the changes and roll out. We also developed measurable goals for reasonable timeframes. Those goals related to staff engagement and safety perceptions, which were measured in our Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality employee engagement surveys. We also wanted to see a decrease in patient harm and an increase in near misses. We did realize a shift in staff engagement, patient harm, and near misses. What is important to note is that the Just Culture shift can't happen over - night. It will take several years to establish a healthy, accountable culture. If you can accept that you cannot change culture overnight, then you can develop a suc - cessful shift.Just Culturepatient safetyrisk management blame journey of behavior training opportunitiescoachingcoaching improvements patient safetycontinually review support honestreduced harm scores systemssafety events mistakesleadership buy-in high reliability align www.apic.org | 33 PREVENTION IN ACTIONWHAT WERE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT CAME UP AS IT WAS ROLLED OUT, AND HOW DID YOU OVERCOME THOSE CHALLENGES? We did see some challenges. One item that I wish we would have implemented at the start was to try to focus on one small safety concern at a time. The reason I mention this is that when we rolled out this initia - tive, we saw that our management teams were only using the Just Culture algorithms when events escalated and moved to a human resource follow-up level. This started to leave the staff feeling like our Just Culture was meant to be punitive. The whole point of a Just Culture was to help the staff to under - stand that mistakes do happen and that sometimes those mistakes can be the result of the system design. We need the staff to talk about the system design so that they can help us to make system changes that support them in their role as a healthcare worker. When you are at a human resource accountability level and hear that we are run - ning the event through Just Culture, that can make you suspicious. So, a few years after the roll out, we are starting to use the Just Culture language and algorithm when we run through smaller near misses. This helps staff to make the connection that sometimes human error happens because we may have designed a system that makes it easier for you to fail. WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE OTHER IPS WHO ARE AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS JOURNEY? Do your research around Just Culture and review what the implications could be. Look into your employee engagement sur - veys and see if staff are engaged. What are their perceptions of patient safety within the organization? Are staff willing to discuss their thoughts with you about their cur - rent processes and how to improve them? Do staff approach the senior leadership with their concerns and offer solutions to those concerns? Do staff feel threatened, or are they ok, when you ask questions about healthcare-associated infections and how to prevent them? How is staff currently held accountable? All of these questions can help you to check the boxes to start engaging your senior leaders to have discussions surround - ing a Just Culture.

ISTOCK.COM/KIWIS It is probably fair to say that the impact has been particularly pro - nounced for infection preventionists (IPs), who were tasked with controlling a novel, highly contagious virus that had several months' head start. For many IPs, the patient care challenges created by the virus itself were compounded by shortages of essential resources such as staff, personal protective equipment (PPE), and diagnostic tests. Long-term care (LTC) facilities have been among those hit hardest by COVID-19. According to data pub - lished by the Kaiser Family Foundation, LTC facilities make up 7% of all coronavirus cases, but more than 40% of all COVID-19 deaths. The reasons are obvious to any IP: LTC facilities house individuals who are particularly vulnerable to infection and death from viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. These individuals most often live in shared rooms, with additional potential for exposure through staff and outside visitors, physical therapy facilities, and shared medical equipment and com - mon rooms. In other words, COVID-19 demanded a particularly rapid, comprehensive, and consistent response from LTC facility leadership and staff. A small team in It's difficult to explain or quantify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals and organizations worldwide. Any attempt will fail to capture hundreds\u2014if not thousands\u2014of ways that the virus altered our lives, professions, and communities. A CASE STUDY FROM THE FRONTLINES OF LONG-TERM CARE Jackie Whitaker 36 | WINTER 2020 | Prevention RAPID AND COMPREHENSIVE RESPONSE A 30-year infection prevention veteran, Jackie Whitaker, RN, MS, CPHRM, CPHQ, CIC, FAPIC, works with a team of nurses to provide IPC support services to more than 700 LTC and acute care facilities. Using a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Infection Control Assessment and Response (ICAR) tool, small teams of IPC nurses visit facilities every two to four weeks to perform these assessments. The team then provides recommendations to help each facility enhance their practices. Multiple U.S. states have hired and deployed such support teams to assist LTC facilities with COVID-19 test - ing, ICAR assessments, and other IPC services. In April 2020, Whitaker and a team of nurses first visited Whispering Oaks, a 236-bed LTC facility in Tampa, Florida, with a variety of resident room types (pri - vate, semi-private, and quad). The facil - ity's administrator, Robert (Bob) Murphy, and Director of Nursing, Tammy Hunt, were eager for any input regarding how they could better protect their residents and staff from COVID-19. \"COVID-19 required every facility to re-examine their infection prevention and control practices,\" Whitaker said. \"Bob and Tammy were committed to doing whatever it took. We were able to provide them with a list of specific recommenda - tions that would enhance their existing approaches.\" These recommendations reinforced basic IPC practices as well as actions spe - cific to COVID-19 and the Whispering Oaks facility. The steps included: Posting competency checklists for hand hygiene as well as donning and doffing of PPE. Installing additional hand sanitiz - ers and prominently posting CDC handwashing guidelines. Posting recommendations for how to clean and disinfect medical equipment. Ensuring disinfectant products are as close to the point of use as possible. Replacing or disposing of any reusable physical therapy equipment that can't be cleaned and disinfected between use by individual residents. Placing barriers in residents' rooms to reduce potential for the virus to spread among the quad units. Evaluating housekeeping practices for resident rooms and the facility as a whole. De-cluttering and removing anything that is unnecessary in common rooms, resident rooms, and the physical ther - apy gym. Conducting high-touch cleaning every two hours and implementing a log to document cleaning and disinfection activities. \"I also recommended that Whispering Oaks review the IPC policies and prac - tices for every contract company that had staff assigned to their facility,\" Whitaker said. \"As soon as these contractors enter your facility, you're responsible for them. Tammy and her team did it all.\" BEST PRACTICE: RETURN TO THE BASICS How did Hunt manage the immediate and comprehensive response required by COVID-19? \"I went back to basics,\" she said. \"I've been in the healthcare field for 30 years. The basics for infection control don't change, regardless of where you are or what the virus is. It's only how we implement it that changes.\" Before Whitaker and her team arrived the first time, Hunt had already reviewed CDC guidelines and began systemati - cally reinforcing\u2014and in some instances, enhancing\u2014precautions where needed. As an example, she added an hourly \"stop and wash\" directive to Whispering Oaks' hand hygiene procedures. She also insti - tuted new PPE requirements, including goggles, shoe covers, and, when supply allowed, N95 masks. Full support from Murphy made Hunt's task more manageable. \"Bob told me from the beginning that he'd do whatever it took to keep his resi - dents safe,\" Whitaker said. \"He was truly committed to supporting Tammy and her team, and to implementing our recommendations.\" When Whitaker was redeployed to Whispering Oaks two weeks after her initial visit, she was pleased and inspired to find that Hunt and her team had completed every item on their list. \"Tammy went above and beyond our recommendations,\" Whitaker said. \"And once she'd implemented the initial action steps, she started calling me with ques - tions and her own ideas and suggestions.\" Whitaker's counsel, coupled with Hunt's experience and dedication to established IPC practices, had a dra - matic impact on Whispering Oaks' residents and staff. While slightly more than half of the reported COVID-19 deaths in Florida were among residents and staff at LTC facilities as of May 31 (Source: Florida Department of Health), Whispering Oaks recorded zero cases of the virus for 28 days between April 18 and May 16. \"Keeping their cases so low, particularly with quad units, was a real testament to their commitment,\" Whitaker said. TACKLING AN OUTBREAK In early June, Hunt left for vacation. She returned to find 12 COVID-19 cases among Whispering Oaks' patients. She also found that Whispering Oaks' staff, led by Assistant Director of Nursing (ADON) Corlissa Jacobs, had already been working hard to tackle the outbreak. \"To get the outbreak under control and prevent future infections, we really had to look at our staffs' belief systems,\" Hunt said. \"There were a lot of people advocating herd immunity in our com - munity. This is really the hardest part of controlling any infection\u2014addressing individuals' personal belief systems.\" Hunt and Jacobs quickly ramped up edu - cation and communication to improve staff compliance with IPC practices. \"We were talking to the staff and conducting educa - tion on a daily basis,\" she said. \"Reinforcing good practice wherever we could and con - stantly providing instruction.\"\"I didn't want our residents to have to be moved to local hospitals. This is their home.\" www.apic.org | 37all IPC practices,\" Hunt said. \"Without the assistance and commitment of our ADON and the rest of our wonder - ful team, our COVID-19 IPC efforts would not have been successful. You also need to have the trust of your resi - dents, family members, and employees, which is something you build every day and must be earned prior to you really needing it.\" Michele Parisi is a freelance writer for Prevention Strategist .

Published online: September 23, 2020To treat the ill residents, Hunt quickly established a COVID-19 unit at Whispering Oaks. \"I didn't want our residents to have to be moved to local hospitals. This is their home,\" she said. \"I told our staff, 'We should keep these patients. They got sick here. Why are we shipping them out to people who don't know them?'\" As soon as the COVID-19 unit was up and running, Hunt asked Whitaker to return to Whispering Oaks to assess it. Whitaker found that the unit had all the best practice elements in place, including barriers between beds and staff members in full PPE (which was immediately disposed of after their shifts). Hunt also ensured that patients in the unit received a shower every day to help them shed the virus and emphasized twice-a-day mouth care. \"It's all of the simple, basic things we've been taught all along as infection preven - tionists,\" Hunt said. \"And don't make it difficult. When you make IPC procedures too complicated, they won't get done.\" Hunt also implemented increased rounding and assessment to help her staff quickly identify and isolate newly infected patients, and says this practice probably had the greatest impact on reversing Whispering Oaks' COVID-19 rates. \"The certified nursing assistants (CNA) were essential in this regard,\" said Hunt. \"From our experience, there is too much focus on temperature and respiratory symptoms. The first signs of this illness in our patients were often loss of appetite and diarrhea. These are more subtle changes that the CNAs are best placed to notice.\" CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT AND IMPRESSIVE OUTCOMES Whitaker visited Whispering Oaks four times between May and July. \"Every time I returned, I could see continued improve - ment in their IPC practices,\" Whitaker said. \"Bob, Tammy, and Corlissa exhibited a real passion and drive to do whatever it took to protect their residents and staff.\" According to data published by the Kaiser Family Foundation, during the period June 24 to July 7, 2020, corona - virus cases increased 51% among LTC facilities in Florida. The rate of increase at Whispering Oaks during this period was 6%. The Florida Department of Health has visited Whispering Oaks multiple times since the start of the pandemic and, not surprisingly, the facility has not received a single infection- control tag. Aside from preventing and then rap - idly controlling COVID-19, Whispering Oaks is reaping additional benefits from their enhanced IPC practices. When two of their residents were exposed to Candida auris at a local hospital in July, Whispering Oaks immediately isolated them under the new procedures. Neither patient became ill, and there have been zero cases of C. auris at Whispering Oaks. \"Everything they've implemented should reduce their infections across the board,\" Whitaker said. Looking back on the COVID-19 expe - rience, Hunt stressed the importance of culture and behavior as a foundation for success. \"You have to have a dedicated staff, and ensure they believe in and will get behind consistent implementation of 38 | WINTER 2020 | Prevention microbial surveillance testing MADE EAS Y NOW!

Wasserman: The paper, \"Recommen - dations for Welcoming Back Nursing FEATURE In late summer 2020 Michael Wasserman, MD, CMB, past president of the California Association of Long Term Care Medicine (CALTCM), co-presented an APIC webinar with Evelyn Cook, RN, CIC, titled \"Managing COVID-19 in Long-Term Care Facilities.\" In a follow-up interview with Prevention Strategist , Wasserman elaborates on best resources for long-term care (LTC) staff, how infection preventionists (IPs) in LTC can advocate for their patients against ageism, and what a LTC facility may look like in a post-COVID-19 world.

PS: How did the CALTCM's Long Term Care Quadruple Aim for COVID-19 Response come about? Wasserman: Our members were imme - diately concerned about the impact of COVID-19 on nursing home residents with the announcement regarding the Kirkland, Washington, nursing facility outbreak on February 29. We began making recommendations to the California Department of Public Health on March 5. Our initial recommenda - tions were focused on leadership and management training, with a particular focus on infection prevention and control efforts. By March 13, we recommended that the IP be full-time and on March 20 our Board passed a resolution to that effect. By the end of March we found ourselves advocating for abundant PPE and readily available testing. We real - ized that we were consistently making these four recommendations and decided to formulate them into our Long Term Care Quadruple Aim for COVID-19 Response on our website on April 17 (www.caltcm.org/assets/CALTCM%20 COVID19%20QUADRUPLE%20AIM%20 FINAL.pdf ). On the same day, we posted our White Paper, \"A Plan to Protect Our Nursing Home Residents\" ( www.caltcm. org/assets/WHITE%20PAPER%20A%20 Plan%20to%20Protect%20Our%20 Nursing%20Home%20Residents%20. pdf), which ultimately became the foun - dation for a paper we published on July 6 in the Journal of Nursing Home Research Science (www.jnursinghomeresearch. com/2263-an-aspirational-approach-to- nursing-home-operations-during-the- covid-19-pandemic.html ). PS: It's apparent that COVID-19 brought to light the inadequacies of LTC infection prevention programs. What do you think LTC in a post-COVID-19 world will look like? Wasserman: While I was CEO of Rockport Healthcare Services 3 years ago, we actually had a leadership retreat where we brainstormed on the issue of how to empower the infection preventionist. It was clear to me at the time that most IPs were not being given enough time and resources to do their job. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought this issue to the forefront. In fact, it's why I immediately understood in early March the impor - tance of focusing on the role of the IP. We are proud of the fact that through CALTCM's advocacy, not only was the full-time IP ensconced through an All Facilities Letter into California nursing facility mitigation plans, but California passed and the Governor signed into law a bill (AB-2644) requiring every nursing home in the state to have a full-time IP. PS: During the webinar, you talked a bit about ageism. Do you think that the death count in the LTC population would be lower if not for ageism? How can IPs advocate for LTC residents? Wasserman: There is no question in my mind that ageism has impacted the entire world's response to COVID-19 as it relates to the LTC population. Let's face it, the lives of vulnerable adults, especially those who live in nursing homes, generally don't matter to policymakers and society in general. Worse yet, I've looked into the eyes of those with the money behind the nursing home industry, and I believe that some of them don't value the residents who live in the facilities that they own. IPs have an important advocacy role, first by focusing on what they do. Secondarily, reminding their colleagues of how they all care for the vulnerable resident that they serve. Frontline staff in nursing homes are the most compassionate and caring people that I've had the privilege of working with over my career. This is actually easy for them to do! PS: What is the most significant problem that LTCs are facing during the pandemic, and do you have a solution or advice?Wasserman: That is a very hard ques - tion to answer. On a very practical level, if a nursing home doesn't have abundant PPE, it will lose the battle to COVID-19. So I tend to place that first. The other elements of our triple aim, infection prevention and control and testing are similarly important. However, if you don't have a strong and effective facility leadership team in place, and in particular one that is competent in crisis leadership and management, it is very likely that you will also fail. So, my answer must ultimately be, assum - ing abundant PPE and readily available testing, the single most important factor is strengthening crisis leadership and management skills. PS: In general, what is the best way for IPs practicing in LTC to stay empowered during this critical time? Wasserman: Connect with your facil - ity medical director. Partner with them. Make sure that they have your back. Speak to them regularly. Seek them out for advice. Speak up in regards to your role with your Administrator and Director of Nursing. If necessary, seek out your local or state health department if you don't believe that you're getting the support that you need. COVID-19 doesn't allow for timidity. If you are not being the infection prevention and control \"general\" in your facility, lives will be lost. PS: Is there anything else you'd like to say to the APIC membership that hasn't been covered? Wasserman: I've had people ask me if IPs are generally adequately prepared to do the job that is needed. In my career, most IPs that I've known are more than capable of doing what is needed during this pandemic. Some may need addi - tional training, most could use addi - tional leadership training, but I believe that IPs \"have what it takes\" to get the job done!

Emergency preparedness policy and procedure www.apic.org | 41FEATURE LOOK AROUND\u2014 BY BOBBIEJEAN GARCIA Subject matter experts (SMEs) in infection prevention and epidemiology is what we are; however, the novel pathogen SARS-CoV-2 has challenged all of us. How can anyone be an expert on a new disease? How am I an expert on COVID-19 , I have asked myself multiple times. Once my flight-fight-freeze response lessened, I felt a pull between being mentally tired from work and the urge to continue helping. My office at the health department provides infection prevention and control consultation to nine health departments and the healthcare entities located within their jurisdictions, and addition - ally covers at least 69 long-term care facilities and 11 acute care facilities. With so much uncertainty in everyday life and new work challenges, it was daunting to figure out how else to help. By talking with colleagues, I realized other infection preventionists (IPs) felt similarly. There was so much work left to do beyond our normal job duties\u2014where else could we make a difference?The need for infection prevention is not just in healthcare settings ISTOCK.COM/ALEUTIE In early April I received a text from a friend. A federal public defender was looking for an SME to write a declara - tion for their client in order to file an emergency release motion. The client was a legal permanent resident with a high-risk medical condition and was requesting release for at-home detention. I saw this as an opportunity to help and contacted them. A week later I got a text from another friend that the international Women's Flat Track Derby Association (WFTDA) was convening a group to cre - ate guidelines for a safe return to roller derby.1 Having played roller derby for 5 years and seeing another opportunity to help, I reached out immediately to let them know I was able to assist.Over the next few months I would get texts from friends and family ask - ing for advice and bouncing ideas off me on whether their measures for pro - tecting themselves against COVID-19 were sound. Even though these situations were not in the healthcare settings that I was familiar and felt most comfortable with, I know infection prevention. My Certification in Infection Prevention and Control (CIC\u00ae) and Fellow in the Association of Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (FAPIC) reminded me that I have experience, knowledge, and valuable insight that can at the very least identify poor infec - tion prevention and control practices and ensure people remain safe.As our small group developed the WFTDA guide, I was able to work with another IP , Nikki McCorristin, at the University of Utah's Neuropsychiatric Institute, and a biostatistician, Mikaela Kosich, at the University of New Mexico, and I realized I was not alone. Many of us SMEs were branching out of healthcare infection pre - vention. I saw T witter posts from others in the infection prevention community on how they were helping and giving shout-outs to their peers; it put a smile on my face to see all this helping outside of work. To quote Mister Rogers, \"look for the helpers.\" I con - nected with a couple of other colleagues and asked them to share their experiences of helping the non-healthcare community during the pandemic. 42 | WINTER 2020 | Prevention Bobbiejean: Tell me about your experi - ence, what made you speak up, and what you took away from it. Anna: I worked as an HAI epidemi - ologist for the Texas Department of State Health Services up until recently, and my main role during the pandemic had been assisting long-term care facilities with pre - venting and containing COVID-19 out - breaks. I have mostly worked over phone and video to provide guidance on infec - tion prevention measures, but I was also deployed onsite to seven nursing homes that were experiencing uncontained out - breaks. My other full-time (and favorite) job is being mom to two precious girls, ages 1 and 3 years. As many parents who have tried working from home with small chil - dren know, it is very tough to be completely present for work and kids at the same time, I would say near impossible if your kids are as curious (read: into everything) as mine. At the beginning of the pandemic I felt nervous about my girls continuing to go to their childcare center when we knew so little about COVID-19. It seemed like the stress of the pandemic amplified my emo - tions, and my \"working parent guilt\" was no exception. I struggled with trying to decide what was best for all of us. I had to focus on the mission I was tasked with\u2014 to advocate for and protect some of our most vulnerable populations. Ultimately, I felt at peace with the decision to send my kids to their childcare centers because I could offer advice by applying my infec - tion prevention knowledge in that setting. My kids went to different childcare cen - ters at the beginning of the pandemic, and both centers remained opened to care for children of \"essential employees.\" Both cen - ters sent an email to families outlining their plans to safely provide care during the pan - demic. Childcare centers are often licensed by the state, and the centers' \"COVID-19 plans\" were a combination of what licensing and local public health were recommending that the facilities implement. I corresponded with both childcare centers to offer advice on their plans and shared that I was certified in infection prevention. I also offered to perform environmental rounds in the centers, but families were not (and still are not) allowed inside, so this did not occur. Helping childcare centers was a new adventure for me and made me realize the basics of infection prevention can be applied outside of the healthcare world. Bobbiejean: That's so good you spoke up, it's just like how we teach patients to speak up and advocate for themselves. Could you share some of those tips in case others want to check with their daycares or schools? Anna: Sure, here are the key points I looked for in the plans: Keeping those who are sick or have been exposed to a confirmed case of COVID-19 at home (both kids and staff) Monitoring symptoms while at the childcare center (e.g., taking tempera - ture and checking for new respiratory symptoms throughout the day) Providing opportunities to perform hand hygiene (e.g., at drop off, after outside time, before lunch, before/after using the restroom, and teaching this skill in a lesson) Having optimal cleaning practices (e.g., increasing frequency of cleaning high- touch surfaces, and using a product that is on the EPA N List) Social distancing (e.g., parents during drop off, staff in the break rooms, and kids throughout the day) Canceling group activities, such as extracurricular activities where stu - dents from many different classes congregate (e.g., dance class) Bobbiejean: What would you tell other IPs about helping outside the hospital or in other medical settings? Anna: We might falsely assume that everyone understands things like how effective hand sanitizer is or why wearing a mask makes sense. But those who live outside of the world of healthcare do not have the same knowledge of infection pre - vention. Offering your expertise is simple to do and may help prevent transmission of COVID-19 in a non-healthcare setting.Bobbiejean: I was fascinated to hear that you helped fire departments. How did you get connected with them? Melissa: Through many years of service in emergency medicine as a paramedic, I developed relationships with several volunteer fire departments and have taught some of their required bloodborne pathogen training in the past few years. Bobbiejean: Why do you think vol - unteer fire departments have questions? Melissa: Volunteer organizations are challenged as they are just that, volunteer. They do not get paid to help and do this work on their own time. Most of their knowledge and experience is from what they see and hear. Since I was the only IP they knew, many of them reached out as COVID-19 became a widespread com - munity concern. Bobbiejean: What were the fire departments most concerned about, and how did you help with those concerns? Melissa: The interesting thing was they were not really concerned about catching COVID-19. They really had more specific questions about the per - sonal protective equipment they had available to them and whether it would provide appropriate protection. I shared with them where to go on the FDA site to ensure masks and other personal protec - tive supplies met guidance.2 I reinforced appropriate donning and doffing as well as the importance of hand hygiene. Hand hygiene is a challenge in these situations as they are often going into someone's home, so soap and water is not an option. Bobbiejean: What worries you most about fire departments, and why? Melissa: I worry most about their clean - ing practices. Through my years of blood borne pathogens classes, we focused on Anna Nutt, MPH, CIC is an IP for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. She previously worked as an HAI epidemiologist for the Texas Department of State Health Services. Melissa Morgan, MSN, RN, CIC, CSPDT, FAPIC, is the system director of infection prevention at Adventist Health. She oversees the infection prevention program for markets located in California, Hawaii, and Oregon. She joined Adventist Health in February 2020, just as the pandemic started.ISTOCK.COM/PAUL ORLANDO ISTOCK.COM/SX70 www.apic.org | 43cleaning as well as donning and doffing. I have seen firsthand poor glove practices as well as a lack of understanding for con - tact times with the disinfectants they have available. Since this virus has a contact component, it's not enough to clean, they have to clean appropriately. They must know how to don and doff appropriately as well as how to use hand sanitizer to clean their hands before and after contact. Bobbiejean: What would you tell other IPs about helping outside the hospital or other medical setting? Melissa: Over the years I have had the opportunity to work with volunteer fire departments, volunteer emergency medi - cal services, schools, and businesses to share my infection prevention knowledge. Although I do that in my job every day it never feels like work when I connect with others to share infection prevention practices. To quote my infection preven - tion mentor, Kim Helsabeck, it fills my cup. This is such a stressful time and many of us may have even questioned why we do this work. Infection prevention is your passion and seeing others benefit from this knowledge will fill your cup, too. The pandemic has really opened our eyes and reminded us that IPs can help anyone. COVID-19 has affected everyone, whether it be from catching the virus, to having to close your business, to worrying about sending your children back to school. IPs have knowledge that allows us the posi - tion to calm the fears of many, share safe practices, and support our communities as they navigate these uncharted waters. As IPs, we are positioned to push training and reinforcement in the community. We have an opportunity to teach children the importance of the basics as well as reinforce the basics with adults. Hand hygiene, respi - ratory etiquette, and cleaning are Infection Prevention 101; however, this pandemic has highlighted that some people missed this class, but it's never too late to learn. We are still in scary times. Science and safe infection prevention and con - trol practices continue to adapt as we learn more everyday about COVID-19. We want to remind everyone not to doubt your knowledge. We should all know our wheelhouse but also know that sometimes you have a bigger bat in your hands than you realize. The infec - tion prevention community is small, but our impact is global. When you think about the number of people who are now trying to maintain a disease-free workplace, we can see that our knowl - edge and instruction will continue to remain important.

Their task was to perform a gap analysis so TUKHS could identify which clinics were appro - priate to add to their provider-based health system, as well as to start form - ing relationships with clinical leaders at this time. The IPs quickly discovered every ambu - latory clinic had a different approach to infection prevention based on their orga - nizational culture, skill level, and willing - ness to change. \"You never knew what you would find in the soiled utility room. Sometimes, the breakroom was also the soiled util - ity room, or it was just a random closet without appropriate airflow. Or, some - times, the soiled utility was also their clean utility or their phlebotomy station because that's how their business occu - pancy was set up,\" said Amanda Cackler, Working together to improve patient safety in clinics The infection prevention team at The University of Kansas Health System (TUKHS) had barely finished ringing in the 2019 new year when they were faced with a daunting task. Not only did they need to clinically integrate nearly 100 ambulatory centers into their system, but they also learned that the Joint Commission would be surveying those ambulatory clinics later that year. TUKHS is based in Kansas City, Kansas, and has five other campuses throughout the state. Several years ago, the health system launched a big clinical integration process in which its physicians and ambulatory clinics became part of a provider-based billing model. The Infection Prevention and Control team at TUKHS joined this process in late 2018, when they were already in the midst of integrating three new hospitals\u2014 on the opposite side of the state\u2014into the system. And if that weren't enough, they were also integrating a new tower in their main hospital with an additional 100 inpatient beds. Facing an expansion of this magnitude while under tight time constraints was a considerable challenge. But in less than a year, TUKHS's infection prevention team was able to clinically integrate a diverse collection of ambulatory clinics and earned kudos at the closing of their Joint Commission visit in November 2019. \"The surveyors acknowledged how impressed they were with some of our ambulatory locations,\" said Tiffany Horsley Kesinger, BSN, RN, CIC, a TUKHS infection preventionist (IP) who specializes in working with the ambula - tory centers. \"We felt very proud of the work our team and the clinics had done.\" Here's what infection prevention team at TUKHS learned about quickly inte - grating a diverse group of ambulatory clinics into their existing system, and their tips for how other IPs can work with ambulatory clinic staff to be allies rather than enforcers. A NEED FOR RESOURCES The ambulatory clinic integration began with a whirlwind. On October 1, 2018, the infection prevention team was AMBULATORY ALLIES: THE UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS HEALTH SYSTEM 46 | WINTER 2020 | Prevention MSN, RN, director of quality, safety, and infection prevention and control for TUKHS. \"We would often find expired supplies and storage of the clean supply inventory needed attention.\" To accomplish the upcoming clini - cal integration, Cackler immediately requested that another IP be added to the team of eight. As the year progressed, she was able to expand the team to 11 IPs. \"We had to make a case from a patient-safety perspective on the return on investment. So it was really a matter of ensuring regulatory compliance, ensuring maintenance with our CMS programs, ensuring the safest patient-care environ - ment. I didn't have to explain much more than that to our leadership,\" Cackler said. \"I understand not every organization has that willingness to provide the addi - tional resources, but I think our focus on patient care and high quality care, and understanding that the patient comes first and how the resources can support that, is a key feature of why we were successful in getting those resources.\" A GROUP EFFORT After the initial sweep of the ambula - tory clinics, the infection prevention team sat down with members of TUKHS's accreditation, regulatory compliance, and environmental health and safety teams. Together, they did a gap analysis of the services the ambulatory centers provide and determined the implications of those services on specific departments. The key goal behind this group effort was to keep visits and assessments from overwhelming the local clinic leaders. Cackler said that coordination of the visits was critical so as not to disrupt the clinics' patient care workflow. Another preassessment topic for the infection prevention team was how to ask questions so that clinic leaders weren't put on the defensive and would willingly give candid responses about their infection prevention methods and goals. For loca - tions that have not previously been vis - ited by the Joint Commission, regulatory readiness was a new concept: issues such as environmental controls and the surveyors' expectations had to be handled sensitively. To prepare, the IPs held daily and weekly team check-ins to review issues and ideas, practiced dialogues, and engaged in role playing. \"You want to seek first to understand the current practices, and then partner with the staff and local leaders,\" Cackler said. \"These cannot be confrontational conversations.\" In their meetings, the IPs discussed how their role was to be not only content experts but also facilitators and negotiators. \"We want to be seen as partners, not as the infection control police,\" Cackler said. To help facilitate this, the IPs devel - oped a \"badge buddy\" for the ambulatory clinic staff that has the phone number for reaching infection prevention 24/7, the IP pager number, and a list of infectious agents that would warrant a call to infec - tion prevention. \"This effort has increased communications with ambulatory clinic staff,\" Cackler said. Horsley Kesinger said it also helped to keep in mind that ambulatory staff was doing the best they could. \"Some of these locations didn't have the financial resources or the infrastruc - ture to make the changes that they might have liked to implement. Maybe, changes involved doing construction that wasn't in their budget,\" she said. \"We wanted them to see us as a resource, and that becoming part of the system would allow them to have some resources that they hadn't had previously. The goal was to show them how we can work together to provide even better care to our patients.\" BOOTS ON THE GROUND The average ambulatory clinic assess - ment visit took about three hours. The goal was to identify infection control trends and themes. IPs used existing tools such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \"Guide to Infection Prevention in Outpatient Settings\" and developed a combined regulatory-IP survey tool to make sure they were not only asking the right questions but also consistently ask - ing the same questions that the Joint Commission would be asking. This combined survey tool allowed both IP and regulatory teams to pull data from a single report and helped facilitate a stronger partnership. On site, the IPs used the Joint Commission tracer observation form for infection prevention and control envi - ronmental rounds. Horsley Kesinger said one of the best features of this tracer tool is its app, which allows IPs to take a picture of an infection prevention con - cern and attach it directly to their gap analysis report. During these visits, the IPs quickly dis - covered that ambulatory clinic personnel had different definitions of procedures and the infection prevention associated with them. \"What we would think of as an invasive procedure, like scopes, they may think of as just a day-to-day procedure, no big deal,\" Cackler said. Horsley Kesinger noted that one of the biggest hurdles was reprocessing of instru - ments. The IPs decided to do an ambula - tory clinic sweep with the sterile processing department project manager to look at reprocessing practices and take an inven - tory of the items the clinics were using. Then, they decided which clinics could bring equipment to the sterile reprocess - ing central location, which ones needed to transition to disposables, and which ones needed coaching on safe practices. Another challenge was that different clinics used different cleaning services and products. Also, some clinics had different Tiffany Horsley Kesinger (left) and Amanda Cackler (right) www.apic.org | 47roles on different days\u2014with changing staff and infection control procedures. \"We might go to a clinic on Tuesday and it was internal medicine, but on Wednesday they were having dental clinic, and we didn't even know,\" Horsley Kesinger said. \"So we had to adapt to each unique situation.\" The upshot, Cackler said, is \"this is something you can't do over the phone. You have to have boots on the ground. It takes significant time and energy to do it, and I can't stress enough that humble inquiry is critical to encourage candid and meaningful answers to some of the high-risk questions you're going to ask.\" Horsley Kesinger said she found what worked best was to ask clinic staff to talk her through how they did a procedure. \"You just take notes, you don't comment, and then you come back after you've compiled your thoughts and looked at what you wrote down and put together some resources. Then your message is: 'This is good; here's where I saw some opportunities, and let's talk through this together.'\" DEVELOPING ACTION PLANS Once the data were collected, the IPs used a risk assessment tool they devel - oped based on APIC resources, which color-codes infection prevention risks from red to yellow to green based on intensity. \"Then we could allocate our resources to put out the hottest fires first,\" Horsley Kesinger said. From January through July 2019, the TUKHS team developed action plans based on those risk assessments, revis - ited clinics, and worked to complete the action plans. A key point, Cackler said, is those plans needed to be individual - ized. \"For ambulatory clinics, one size doesn't fit all.\" The infection prevention team also developed an ambulatory infection pre - vention toolkit, using CDC ambulatory care guides and the infection preven - tion chapter of the Joint Commission handbook as a jumping-off point. This online document has links to TUKHS policies on topics like \"When to Call Infection Prevention Control,\" \"Environment of Care.\" There are also links to resources like how to order \"cover your cough\" signs or personal protective equipment. Because the ambulatory toolkit is online, it's ever-evolving, Cackler said, and can be updated to address new risks like COVID-19. \"It's a one-stop shop for these depart - mental leaders, addressing issues like: Here's what you need to do with clean and sterile supply storage or hand hygiene programs. Here's how we monitor sharps safety or soiled equip - ment,\" she said. \"It's one nice little pack - age that they can access electronically so everyone has the same information.\" Horsley Kesinger said ambulatory clinic staff like the tool - kit because they can consult it on their schedules. \"So many things were changing for them\u2014not just infection control changes, but sometimes their electronic medical record systems, their process for docu - mentation and billing\u2014that it was an information overload,\" she said. \"So it was important to develop a resource like the ambulatory toolkit that they could go back to later.\" LESSONS LEARNED Since the clinical integration was fin - ished in July 2019, TUKHS's ambula - tory clinics are now part of the IPs' scope of care. To ensure that nothing slips through the cracks, Horsley Kesinger's job is now devoted to ambulatory clinic infection prevention. She schedules regular rounding, educational activi - ties, and training. She's also taking the APIC ambulatory course to improve her knowledge. \"It's a unique enough area that it's good to have someone dedicated to ambulatory care,\" Horsley Kesinger said. \"Having worked in the inpatient world and now in the ambulatory world, I realize that IPC tasks at the hospital may be most likely to get your attention, and it's easy to put that clinic visit off because it doesn't fall neatly into your workflow.\" Cackler said her team's goal whenever they interact with an ambulatory clinic is to be seen as a resource: \"We're not just someone coming through with a clip - board to checkmark things off. We're here to help.\" Vicky Uhland is a freelance writer for Prevention Strategist.

REGISTRATION IS NOW OPEN FOR APIC'S 2021 ANNUAL CONFERENCE 1023611_Editorial.indd 1 11/3/20 10:04 PMINTRODUCTION The emergence of the COVID-19 pan - demic has led to increased use of imported and non-medical face masks in many healthcare facilities, due to critical short - ages in the United States. Some studies have indicated that up to half of surveyed healthcare professionals have limited education regarding personal protective equipment (PPE) and proper usage, nota - bly masks.1,2 The evolving crisis has made it imperative to fill this knowledge gap and educate healthcare personnel regard - ing currently available face coverings such as respirators, surgical masks, and cloth masks. This paper aims to help healthcare personnel formulate their own judgment in using commonly encountered face cover - ings in a healthcare setting. TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19 In order to put information on mask performance into a usable context, it is important to first understand the modes of viral transmission. Current data suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is primarily transmitted via respiratory droplets and contact routes.3,4 While still controver - sial, airborne spread is also emerging as a possible mode, especially in healthcare situations that generate aerosols.5-9 Respiratory droplet transmission occurs when an infected person releases respira - tory droplets (>5\u00b5m) by talking, cough - ing, or sneezing within close distances (<1m), allowing droplets to enter mucous membranes (eyes and nose), mouth, or be drawn into the mouth and upper respiratory A guide to respirators and face masks for the healthcare professional tract. Due to their relatively large size, it is thought that respiratory droplets fall to the ground before they can travel distances farther than 1 meter in the air.10,11 Contact transmission occurs when respiratory droplets containing infective virus fall to a surface and another person subsequently touches that surface, then transmits the virus from their hands to one of the host entry routes\u2014that is, nose, mouth, or eyes. Airborne transmission, on the other hand, occurs via particles that are much smaller (<5\u00b5m), often referred to as droplet nuclei. Due to their small size, droplet nuclei can travel greater distances (>1m) and remain suspended in the air for hours.11,12 Airborne transmission occurs when an uninfected person breathes in droplet nuclei contain - ing infective virus at a sufficient viral con - centration, or the minimum infective dose (MID), required to cause disease. FACE COVERINGS OVERVIEW The use of face coverings protects both the healthcare worker and the patient from respiratory and droplet transmission of viral particles. Face coverings include respirators, surgical masks, and cloth masks. Respirators, technically referred to as N95s or disposable filtering facepieces, are a pri - mary form of protection against airborne transmission used in healthcare.13,14 They are designed as PPE and protect the wearer from the entry of infectious particles into the nose and mouth (entry portals); this is accomplished through both physical filtra - tion and, if specially treated, electrostatic forces.15,16 Surgical masks, on the other hand, are primarily designed as barriers to block moisture, such as blood or large-par - ticle droplets, from reaching entry portals.17 Surgical masks are also used as a means of source control by reducing dissemina - tion of the wearer's saliva and respiratory secretions. Cloth masks are inferior to both respirator masks and surgical masks.18,19 Due to critical shortages in these supplies, cloth masks have been recommended as a last resort. It is important to note that not all face masks referred to or marketed as respirators or surgical masks meet the qualifications necessary to offer adequate protection in a healthcare setting. FILTRATION EFFICIENCY AND FLUID RESISTANCE Filtration efficiency is a metric based on laboratory testing methods which correlates to how well a mask filters out particles of different sizes. Fluid resistance is associated with the ability of a mask to block splash, spray, or splatter of fluids, such as blood. The filtration efficiency of most widely available respirators is determined by the sodium chloride (NaCl) aerosol testing method. 20-22 These respirators, such as the United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) N-series, are tested using a polydisperse NaCl aerosol of 0.075 \u00b1 0.02 \u00b5m and a geo - metric standard deviation (GSD) of 1.86, which equates to a mass median aerody - namic diameter (MMAD) of 0.350\u00b5m.20 This size aerosol approximates the most penetrating particle size (MPPS). MPPS is the particle diameter that allows maximum BY BRIANNA DAMADIAN AND JOANNE KWANUNMASKING the maskFEATURE ISTOCK.COM/LENA_DATSIUK Prevention Strategist would like to thank the National Institutes for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) for their review of this paper. CDC Surgical Mask 50 | WINTER 2020 | Prevention penetration through a filter medium, estimated to be 0.30\u00b5m.23 The filtration efficiency is reported as the percentage of 0.350\u00b5m NaCl particles filtered by the respirator. In order to be approved as a NIOSH N95, filtration efficiency must be 95% or greater. 20 It is important to note that N95 filter - ing facepieces also work against a range of particles smaller than 0.01\u00b5m up to roughly 10\u00b5m. The most penetrating size is 0.3\u00b5m, and therefore the size that is tested. Particles larger than the MPPS are filtered more efficiently due to greater iner - tial impaction and interception. Particles smaller than the MPPS are more likely to be affected by Brownian motion. That is, the smaller a particle the more ran - dom, erratic movement it has as it moves through the filter material, leading to greater probability that it will settle in a place of capture.23 The filtration performance of surgical masks is reported with metrics such as bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE) and particulate filtration efficiency (PFE). 24,25 However, while surgical masks do filter particles, they primarily block moisture such as blood and large droplets (>5\u00b5m). As such, the more important parameter to consider for a surgical mask is fluid resistance, which is a measure of penetra - tion by a small volume (2mL) of synthetic blood at three different velocities. These velocities are meant to simulate splashes or sprays at venous pressure (80mmHg), arterial pressure (120mmHg), and high pressure due to situations such as trauma or surgical irrigation (160mmHg).25 CERTIFICATION STANDARDS All respirators and surgical masks mar - keted for professional use, whether medical or other, must meet specific certification standards. Certification standards repre - sent minimum performance requirements and are determined by a governing body or committee in the country of use. As such, these standards vary between countries but typically have similar stipulations. They are based upon parameters such as filtration efficiency, fluid resistance, flammability, and bio - availability, and provide a useful gauge for com - paring the performance of imported respirators and surgical masks to domestic respirators and surgical masks. It is important to note that the protec - tiveness of a device is strongly dependent on individual fit. Filtration is a character - istic of the filter material, but fit is a design characteristic; if a material has great filtra - tion efficiency but the respirator or mask has a loose fit, there will be high particle penetration. Therefore, even though certi - fication standards may only be achievable with proper fit, they should not be used as the sole determinant of protection. Instead, these standards should be considered in combination with other factors such as personal fit testing, leakage, and donning/ doffing technique. Another consideration in evaluating respirators and surgical masks is that the authenticity is not ensured solely by evalua - tion of certification standard labelling. The most definitive method in the determina - tion of respirator and surgical mask qual - ity is formal laboratory testing. However, knowledge of respirator and surgical mask standards can help the healthcare profes - sional to establish best judgment. Other predictors of quality, such as manufacturer and supplier trustworthiness, are impor - tant to consider but out of the scope of this discussion. CRACKING THE CODE OF RESPIRATORS There are many different types of respi - rators available in the United States with various intended uses. The most impor - tant categories to consider in this global health crisis are (a) air purifying respirators (APRs) and (b) supplied-air respirators. APRs, also referred to as particulate res - pirators, cover at least the nose and mouth and are designed to achieve both very close facial fit and efficient filtration of airborne particles.17 There are 3 general subclas - sifications of APRs used in the filtering powered air-purifying (PAPRs). Table 1 compares the different types of APRs, their subtypes, certification stan - dards, country of origin, and filtration effi - ciencies. Supplied-air respirators include the self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and provide their own source of clean air rather than filtering particles from the surrounding air.FFRs are the primary type of respirator used in healthcare to protect against airborne (also known as aerosol) particulates. They cover the nose and mouth, are disposable, and are intended for single use. Disposable N95 respirators, frequently used in the hospital setting, are FFRs. Some have a one-way exhalation valve while others do not. Valves help improve breathability by reducing excessive dampness and warmth. However, the inability to filter the user's exhaled particles can lead to a potential source of contamination by an infected wearer. FFRs in the United States are classified as either standard or surgical. Standard FFRs can be either valved or non-valved but may not be fluid resistant; industrial models fall into the standard category.26 Surgical FFRs are non-valved due to the contamination risk posed by an exhalation valve, and therefore filter par - ticles from both the user and the environ - ment. Surgical FFRs are also fluid resistant and meet the ASTM F1862 fluid resistance testing standard.27 Other countries may use the ISO 22609 testing standard as a measure of fluid resistance.28 Elastomeric and PAPRs are types of respirators that supplement the variety of respiratory protection available to health - care personnel, especially during critical shortages of FFRs.29 Elastomeric respira - tors include half-face or full-face masks in which the elastomeric facepiece itself is washable, while the filters or cartridges are exchangeable. PAPRs are positive-pressure, battery-operated devices, that are either hooded or non-hooded, and also have replaceable filters or cartridges. NIOSH classifies filter material for FFRs, elastomeric respirator CFR Part 84.20 The N-series are tested against a mildly degrading aerosol of NaCl, as described above. R-series and P-series filters are tested against a highly degrading aerosol of dioc - tylphthalate (DOP).20 Therefore, N (not resistant to oil) means that the respirator cannot be used in an oily aerosol environ - ment; R (somewhat resistant to oil) and P (strongly resistant to oil) indicate that the respirator can be used for protection against both non-oily and oily aerosols. Numerical ISTOCK.COM/MAGNILIONISTOCK.COM/MAGNILION Elastomeric Half FacepieceElastomeric Full Facepiece www.apic.org | 51designations 95, 99, and 100 represent the filter's minimum filtration efficiency of 95%, 99%, and 99.97%, respectively, for particles with a MMAD of 0.3\u00b5m. Again, filtration efficiencies are determined at the MPPS, and consequently, APRs are even more efficient against particles that are both smaller and larger than 0.3\u00b5m. Based upon preliminary studies, SARS-CoV-2 has an approximate diameter of 0.06-0.14\u00b5m and has a lipid envelope.30 While it is true that coronavirus is encased by a lipid (fat/oil) envelope, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that this lipid coating is not sig - nificant enough to interfere with the N (not resistant to oil) series filters. Therefore all N/P/R series filters are appropriate for filtering out SARS-CoV-2 when protection against aerosol is required, such as during aerosol-generating procedures.31 Over the course of the pandemic, respi - rators from other countries have emerged in the U.S. The CDC provides a list of \"Respirators Approved Under Standards Used in Other Countries That Are Similar to NIOSH-approved Respirators\" for consideration as use during a crisis capacity strategy.29 Table 1 compares NIOSH-approved respirators to the commonly available approved (China) and to N/P/R 95/99/100s, however, FFP1 has a filtration efficiency of 81%, which is not recom - mended for medical use.32 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has provided a list of respirators that have received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) during the COVID-19 pandemic for use in healthcare settings by healthcare professionals when used in accordance with CDC recommendations, and when NIOSH-approved respirators are not avail - able. With the update on June 23, 2020, the FDA published the names of approved respi - rator manufacturers in China to help combat counterfeiting.33 This list serves as a helpful tool for healthcare workers to access when attempting to determine if a given respirator is currently authorized by the FDA under the current EUA. Additionally, the perfor - mance of these specific respirator models has been independently assessed by NIOSH's National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory and published on the NIOSH website.34 While not an exhaustive assess - ment of available models/brands, this list provides true laboratory measurements of fil - tration efficiency of some of the most widely available respirators from Europe and China.THE 3-PLY CONUNDRUM There are numerous types of surgical and procedure masks on the current market. Most of these masks are of 3-ply non-woven construction, but only certain ones meet the requirements of the FDA as a surgical-grade mask. A surgical mask is defined by the FDA as \"a loose-fitting, disposable device that creates a physical barrier between the mouth and nose of the wearer and potential contaminants in the immediate environ - ment\".17 It must be FDA approved under 21 CFR 878.4040 as a Class II Medical Device. Surgical masks are tested for fluid resistance (ASTM F1862), filtration efficiency, pres - sure drop (breathability), flammability, and biocompatibility.35 There are various types of 3-ply masks currently marketed for medical use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Table 2 exam - ines the most commonly encountered types by comparing certification standards and, importantly, fluid resistance.25-28, 35-40 Given the dynamic changes in the mask market, this table may not include all varieties or new-to-market devices. The United States FDA has 3 levels of fluid resistance for surgical masks, which cor - relates to low (Level 1), moderate (Level 2), and high (Level 3) barrier protection.25 In general, Level 1 procedure masks are used for short procedures and exams that do not Table 1: Comparison of Air Purifying Description Disposable nose and mouth Filters dust, mist, fumes Reusable facepiece Replaceable filters or cartridges Reusable components Replaceable filters or cartridges Battery-operated blower filters throughout N/P/R 95/99/100Half or cartridges can be for particulate, gas/vapor, or a combination.Tight or loose-fitting.

Filtering Facepiece 52 | WINTER 2020 | Prevention involve aerosols, sprays, or fluids. Level 2 and Level 3 surgical masks are used for procedures that involve aerosols, sprays, and fluids such as in the operating room. The GB 19083-2010 surgical mask38 from China is equivalent to a Level 1, whereas the YY 0469-2011 surgical mask37 from China and the EN 14683-2014 Type IIR surgical masks39 from Europe are equivalent to a Level 2. However, not all surgical and procedural masks are tested for fluid resistance. For example, the YY/T 0969-2013 medical mask36 from China and the Type I and Type II EN 14683-2014 medical/surgical masks from Europe are not rated for fluid resistance and thus should not be used for respiratory droplet protection. Some surgical and procedure masks are also tested for filtration efficiency. While not as important compared to respirators due to the loose fit of these masks, it is interesting to note that the GB 19083-2010 surgical mask from China is tested for PFE similarly to all U.S. FDA surgical masks, while many others are not tested for PFE at all.38 CLOTH MASKS For healthcare personnel, a cloth mask, like those used by the general public as source control, should always be a last resort. Cloth masks are not considered PPE, since their capability to protect healthcare workers is unknown. There have been studies published illustrating the inferiority of cloth masks compared to medical grade masks.18,19 However, a 2013 review of the available literature indicated that there is historical evidence, mainly from the first half of the 19th century, that cloth masks may provide some level of protection and reduce exposure to aerosols, though this remains unproven due to the absence of randomized controlled trials.41 If it becomes necessary to use cloth masks in healthcare due to the unavailability of respirators and surgical masks, healthcare personnel must understand the different qualities that make a respirator or surgi - cal mask effective and how they apply to cloth masks. Information on the filtration efficiency of different fabrics is limited. One study in 2010 evaluated the filtration performance of five common fabrics (e.g., 100% cotton, polyester, cotton/polyester blend) of 5.5 and 16.5 cm/s in order to approxi - mate NIOSH test methods.42 The results indicated that 74-90% of particles could penetrate the cloth masks at 5.5cm/s face velocity (33L/min flow rate). Another study by Konda et al used NaCl aerosol-based testing to compare filtration efficiencies for particles less than 0.3\u00b5m and greater than 0.3\u00b5m for different fabric types and layers.43 According to this study, cotton quilt, cotton/chiffon hybrid, cotton/silk hybrid, and cotton/flannel hybrid provide the highest filtration efficiencies for par - ticles less than 0.3\u00b5m. However, the testing in this study was performed under reduced pressure drops and flow rates and without simulating proper fit, making it difficult to compare the filtration efficiencies to that of particulate respirators. A more recent study examined the filtration efficiency of common household fabrics with NaCl aerosols (CMD 0.075 \u00b1 0.02 \u00b5m; GSD 1.86) at a flow rate of 32L/min in order to simulate a NIOSH testing method.44 Under these conditions, cotton, polyester, nylon, and silk had filtration efficiency ranging from 5-25%. While the results of these few limited studies suggest that there may be some minimal filtration capability of cloth masks, the methods by which these fil - tration efficiencies have been measured are not consistent. As a result, the filtration efficiencies cannot be compared among studies or to NIOSH standards. Many fabrics also have water resistance proper - ties, which is a desirable characteristic for the construction of protective cloth masks. However, few studies have examined the water resistance of various types of fabrics under standardized test methods, which would be required in order to be compa - rable to fluid resistance testing. As previously mentioned, fit is extremely important. Fit is widely variable, and cloth masks are typically not designed to con - form tightly to the face. In summation, if cloth mask use in the healthcare setting is warranted due to the catastrophic shortage of respirators and surgical masks, health - care personnel should look for a well-fitted mask, constructed with multilayered fab - rics, and a water-resistant outer layer. CONCLUSION Respirators and surgical masks are vital components to protection against respi - ratory illness.

In times of critical shortage, healthcare workers should perform due diligence to ensure the face covering they are using provides adequate protection. To remain informed, they must have a basic knowledge of mask composition, certifi - cation standards, measures of filtration efficiency, testing methods, and govern - ment resources, all of which has been discussed in this report. Additionally, if cloth masks become necessary, the same characteristics that make respira - tors and surgical masks effective should be applied, though more studies are needed to properly assess their level of protection.
