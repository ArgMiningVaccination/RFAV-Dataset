HH COLLECTIVE is a beautiful online resource and platform of gifted, Independent Healers whose unique & individual modalities go WAY beyond just the typical \"mind, body & soul,\" that is common in the holistic realm. Their approaches work both solo & synergistically to uncover & address the root of your suffering truly at the WHOLE being. Together HH Collective addresses all the realms that allow us to be a living, breathing human. Our biochemical physical body, our psychological, emotional, inner child & spiritual realms, our subconscious mind & subconscious programming, our soul & soul's creation, the quantum realm, AND for those ready to dive even deeper, a few of our Healers work in healing/clearing ancestral debt, karma & past life causations. Due to our truly WHOLEistic approach, we are able to help you heal & transform your WHOLE being in ways you never thought possible yet always hoped for. So much of what my team does is bring healing & health to those who have been told their is no hope or they just have to live with XYZ or be on medication forever to \"manage.\" So whatever brought you here: acute issues, chronic conditions, feeling lost in life, mental health suffering, or sheer curiosity; I am grateful & excited for you to have found us!

SHOP/LEARN An array of Carina's favorite companies/products to support your overall well-being & health FOUNDER'S STATEMENT : WHY I CREATED HH COLLECTIVE My own battles with chronic illnesses, pain & extreme mental/emotional issues took me on a long, rollercoaster journey that I truly didn't think I would make out of alive. Over the years from age 12-22, I wracked up hundreds of thousands of dollars in conventional medical bills; surgeries, over 50+ medications prescribed to me for my countless list of ailments, symptoms & conditions --- only to end up age 23, even worse off than in my teens & with zero quality of life. I was suicidal, severely depressed & not seeing how my health, self, or life would ever improve or get better. After conventional medicine & psychiatry failed me time and time again, I became even more desperate for help & answers. I was sick and tired of being fed drugs to bandaid my symptoms, or recommended the next surgery to try. I wanted to find out the reasons WHY I was suffering like I was, and uncover the root causes, so that I could then find REAL solutions. So in 2013, I decided to put my ego aside and began opening my mind & heart to alternative healing modalities. I also began studying to \"become my own best doctor.\" Over the next 5+ years I spent another $20K on various alternative treatments before I met the incredible people, Healer's & truly gifted souls that are now part of my Team. Their profound & powerful gifts/modalities and their transformation on my well-being, is one of my life's greatest blessings. I knew in my gut I needed to join forces with them to help bring their gift's to as many people as possible all over the world. And so HH Collective Wellness was born. My Team is a beautiful result of the dark journey that lead me to where I am now. Remember, you don't have to suffer in silence. And you don't have to continue suffering. You CAN heal. And you don't have to face it alone. Love always, Carina \"Everything in our universe is energy, including us. Therefore every aspect of our health, well-being & life is interconnected and constantly communicating with & affecting each other through various frequencies. \" \"The energy body acts as a bridge connecting our physical and spiritual bodies. In order for us to influence transformation of the body and mind, we must first learn to transform the energy flow.\" Ilchi Lee "}
