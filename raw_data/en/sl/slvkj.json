Logo of NELS depicts all three domains of learning. Three 'H': Head for cognitive, Hands for v psychomotor and Heart for attitude. INTROduCTION NELS encompasses correcting the physiological effects of illness or injury prior to making a definitive diagnosis and management by an expert. In an emergency, the correct path requires competence and confidence at the front line which National Emergency Life Support (NELS) course aims to impart. It seeks to benefit all health care professionals who wish to learn the practical and comprehensive approach for dealing with acute conditions, causing risk to life and/or limb. It also aims to meet the expectations of those health care providers, who do not regularly treat emergencies and trauma. Thus, NELS is multi professional and multi-disciplinary, which is important for the management in a critically ill patient encountered in Emergency Department (ED). NELS approach aims that, by the end of the course, all participants will be able to promptly assess and manage a critically ill or injured patient so as to prevent mortality and morbidity. The Most important step is to do best possible in the existing circumstances as per availability of resources and does no further harm, consult an expert and finally transport safely to the appropriate place for further management. Hence NELS is dedicated to our Nation in the hope that preventable morbidity and mortality may be avoided.ObjECTIvES Upon completion of the lesson the trainee would be able to: Understand the concept of NELS Course v Visualize the aim and need of the course v Understand the process and schedule of the course v Learn the importance of affective, cognition, and psychomotor domains of learning v Develop an attitude to save a life vProvider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 2 Lesson 1: NELS course: In troduc tionWha T WaS ThE NEEd TO dEvElOP NElS? Saving a life is the top most priority of any health care provider to the best of his/her capability using available resources. All medical professionals know the medical treatment of typhoid but suppose if typhoid fever patient comes in shock, and it is not treated promptly, it can be life-threatening. In this patient, priority will be to stabilize oxygenation and circulation/perfusion first, suspect enteric perforation and ask for help from a surgeon to make a final diagnosis of suspected intestinal perforation due to enteric fever and do further definitive management/surgical intervention. Time is of essence in any seriously sick patient, so a straightforward protocolized approach to deal with any patient, can save time and resources leading to a better outcome for such a patient. At present, there is no national life-saving skill training course for emergency situations at the hospital level. International training courses of American Heart Association like Basic Life Support (BLS), Advance Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) are only relevant in cardiac problem or cardiac arrest situations and Advance Trauma Life Support (ATLS) is for trauma victims. These courses do not train in comprehensive life saving skills required to manage all types of emergencies in an ED. Moreover, the cost of these training courses is not affordable by all, so it was important to develop economically viable, a comprehensive life-saving skill training tool relevant to Indian scenario, where any critically ill patient irrespective of diagnosis can be saved by any front-line medical care provider and referred at the earliest possible for definitive treatment, to be imparted by the specialist. So, there was an urgent need for one training program for all life-threatening or potentially life and/or limb threatening problems for health care providers dealing with such patients. NELS skill course is comprehensive, includes respiratory, cardiac, trauma, medical, surgical, obstetric and paediatric emergencies. It integrates all situations, starting from prehospital, hospital care in emergency and then safely transferring for definitive care. It teaches from basic to advance lifesaving skills and is meant for front-line health care providers who are the first to deal with patients and who may have not been trained in dealing with very sick patients. hOW IS IT CONduCTEd? NELS is a skill and competency based practical course for all healthcare professionals, to build capacity and confidence at the front line to preserve life and limbs of patients arriving with serious illness or injury so that they can be safely transferred to a specialist if required for complete recovery. The specialty of this course is that different common emergency situations are presented and discussed with respect to assessment and management. It is mainly the interaction of participants with faculty based on a scenario. This is aimed to be achieved by intense hands-on training in practical procedures provided under the supervision of experienced faculty in skill lab using mannequins, models, simulator and live demonstrations by the faculty of different scenarios of undifferentiated emergencies, in addition to focused teaching in small groups and to evaluate the learning by the participants. All participants are required to attend the complete course to understand all aspects of assessment and management of all types of emergency situations. SChEdulE NELS course is conducted over a period of five days by the experienced and specially trained faculty, providing personal attention to all, with a systematic programme aiming to ensure that at all stages the health care provider is focused on correct assessment and necessary action to improve the outcome for the patient, always with attention to three principles of preserving life and limb, initiating correct treatment, nursing management and safe transfer for definitive treatment. All participants gain knowledge of affective (attitude), cognitive and psychomotor domains of basic and advanced life saving aspects of oxygenation, airway, breathing, basic life support, assessment and management of a trauma victim, cardiac, neurological and other medical emergencies, specialty emergencies of obstetrics and pediatrics.Lesson 1: NELS course: In troduc tion 3An evaluation of all domains of knowledge is assessed by the expert faculty during the course by multiple questions, by teaching a lifesaving skill to another participant, scenario practice on mannequins and moulage volunteers. Throughout the training programme, participants are encouraged to participate in the management of real-life scenarios of critically ill patients, with the help from passionate trainers to improve participants' skills and attitude towards saving a life. lEaRNINg Learning has three components, cognitive, knowledge/mental skills, Psychomotor/manual or physical skills, and last but not the least, affective/feeling/emotional or attitude. To be a good human being especially a health care giver, we need to acquire all the three domains in equal proportion to give the best care to our patients. Conduct of the course tries to teach participants, all the domains and skills but learning/performing in real situations will depend s on their attitude. There is a saying that 'Practice makes a person perfect' but the motto of NELS is 'Repeated perfect practice makes a person perfect.' A skill once learned with a positive attitude comes back in a real situation to save someone's life. The participants are encouraged to find an opportunity to learn and continue to keep themselves practicing all the lifesaving skills learned in the course in their hospitals. Namaskar Logo of NELS depicts all these three domains of learning Three 'H': Head for cognitive, Hands for psychomotor and Heart for attitude. Clinical Pearls Saving a life is the top priority \u0083 Greeting by doing Namaskar in India signifies all the three domains of learning. \u0083Lesson 2: NELS Approach: Initial A ssessmen t & Ac tion Lesson 2: NELS Approach: Initial A ssessmen t & Ac tion 5 INITIAL ASSESSMENT & ACTIoNNELS AppRoACh: LESSoN 2 CORE CONCEPTS Impaired oxygenation and perfusion to vital organs are the commonest cause of morbidity and v mortality in a critically ill patient. NELS approach includes a continuous circle of assessment and action of A (Airway), B (Breathing), v C (Circulation), D (Disability/Neurological) and E (Exposure & Environment) to find out and treat life-threatening conditions. The priority for initial assessment and management, in all patients must be ABCD. v A rapid and accurate clinical assessment of patient's condition by Look, Listen and Feel, for symptoms v and signs and taking life, limb & organ saving actions in the critically ill or injured patients, must be undertaken without delay. Early and correct application of the NELS approach and management is advocated without exception v for correction and reversal of the first physiological and then pathological derangement.Give oxygen to all breathing patients with the maximum percentage of oxygen in an emergency. v NElS aPPRO aCh assessment A critically ill or injured patient is one with an acute risk to systemic oxygenation and perfusion to vital organs, caused by clinically significant adverse effects on Airway (A), Breathing (B), Circulation (C) or Disability (D) from life-threatening or potentially life-threatening illness or injury; Risks to vital organs, limb or eyesight must also be considered an urgent priority. ObjECTIvES Upon completion of the lesson the trainee would be able to: Apply NELS approach by listing the priorities in assessment and management v of all emergencies and trauma patients Assess and manage life threatening problem v Apply the universal precautions v Understand the concept of triage, team and Non technical skills vProvider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 6 Lesson 2: NELS Approach: Initial A ssessmen t & Ac tionTypically, the routine sequence in medicine is, to first ask history of present illness and past history, then perform general physical and systemic examination, reach a provisional diagnosis, perform investigations to confirm or rule out provisional diagnosis and then make a final diagnosis followed by management. However, there is no time to go through this sequence in a critically ill patient. It is important to form a general impression in a critically ill/trauma victim by just looking at a patient, even before taking a history or conducting a formal clinical examination. We are able to form a general impression based on key observations as to whether the patient is critically ill or injured and requiring what kind of urgent or immediate clinical attention is needed. When we are dealing with several patients together, it also helps us to identify those patients who may be more sick and need to be attended first. The initial approach is thus a crucial and essential step for the clinician who must promptly prioritize and provide appropriate management. A critically ill or injured patient can be identified and life-threatening issues addressed without aiming at a definitive diagnosis. Compromised airway and breathing will harm the patient regardless of underlying cause or pathology since heart and brain cannot survive without oxygen for long. Impaired circulation and perfusion to tissues, will lead to an adverse neurological outcome in the patient having neurological problem. Hence, safeguarding the patient's oxygenation and circulation takes precedence over all else. The clinician must always assess the patient and take necessary action according to the ABCD priority. Patient's respiration, perfusion, and mental status can be assessed in just a few seconds by asking questions to the patient and observing the response. In case the response is appropriate, ABCD can be considered to be all right at that moment. But it is essential to repeatedly observe and re-assess for any deterioration in the ABCD. Use monitors at the earliest possible to assess and reassess the effect of life-saving interventions: Pulse oximeter for airway and breathing, NIBP (Non-invasive Blood Pressure monitor), ECG (Electrocardiography), Urinary output, the temperature for circulation/perfusion. aSSESSmENT by lOOk, lISTEN aNd FEEl assessment and action general management High-flow oxygen must be started in all critically ill patients at the earliest possible. Give oxygen to all v patients with the maximum percentage of oxygen in the acute situation and later de-escalate oxygen percentage, to keep Oxygen saturation (SpO 2) at more than 94%. The Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability (ABCD) approach is of utmost importance for first v assessment and treatment of injured and critically ill patients. Simultaneously, try to find out the cause and if required take an expert opinion or send to a proper v facility with resources for definitive management.Using this approach, the first assessment and actions are performed simultaneously and repeatedly . v Early use of vital signs monitoring is helpful to assess, reassess and check response to the management. v A Pulse oximeter, ECG monitor and cyclical non-invasive blood pressure monitor must be applied to all critically ill patients, as soon as possible. Never leave a deteriorating patient without a priority management. v airway Check for Airway patency, A person who is awake and talking clearly can be assumed to have a patent airway. With a completely obstructed airway, there is no effective airflow despite respiratory effort. Noisy breathing is present in a partially obstructed airway. Identify patients whose airway is either obstructed or at risk of getting compromised (patient with an allergy, inhalational burns, facial trauma). These patients require immediate intervention. A person with facial burns may have a muffled or hoarse voice, suggesting an impending airway obstruction. A change in voice, the presence of carbon particles on the face and singeing of facial hair should be taken as a sign of inhalational burns, which can lead to serious consequences.Lesson 2: NELS Approach: Initial A ssessmen t & Ac tion 7Breathing: Neck and Chest Chest wall movements, Respiratory Rate Accessory muscles of respiration Neck veins, injury, swelling Talking full sentences Noisy breathing Wheeze Trachea Crepitus, tenderness, ribs, clavicle Cold, sweatyLook Listen Feel Circulation Skin colour for pallor, cyanosis, injury, bleeding Capillary rell time, distended neck veins Abdominal distension Limb swelling, deformity Restless, drowsy Breath and Heart sounds Bowel sounds Blood pressure Extremities warm or cold Percussion Chest All Pulses: rate, volume, regularity, equality Abdominal tenderness, pelvic stabilityLook Listen Feel Exposure and Environmen t Expose to see front and log roll to see back for bleeding, injury, swelling, foreign body, bite marks Burn Listen to focussed history Swelling, step down deformity of spine Per rectal examination for pelvic injuryLook Listen FeelDisability (Neu rological) Level of consciousness, facial asymmetr y Pupil (Size and Reac tion) Limb movement s Seizur es GCS (Eye Opening) Orientation to person, time and place Type of speech GCS (Verbal Response) Muscle tone and power Sensory Response to external stimuli and pa in GCS (Motor Resp onse )Look Listen FeelAirway: Face and Neck Colour of lips/skin Swelling / hematoma/injury Signs of airway difculty Talking in clear voice: Airway is clear Gurgling, snoring Stridor, Hoarse voice Air movement Crepitation on neck, faceLook Listen Feel Note: Though these are the major areas of concern, but, health care workers must assess ABCDE as per NELS approach GCS: Glasgow, Coma Scale.Table 2.1: Area of concern with respect to ABCDE as indicated by look, listen or feel method Airway must be protected in patients with absent airway reflexes or decreased level of consciousness with a GCS score of 8 or less. The cervical spine must always be protected in patients with suspected or known cervical spine injury (use sand bags, cervical collar, Manual In-Line Stabilization). Airway obstruction can be treated in the majority of cases using simple methods such as airway opening maneuvers, suction, and insertion of airway adjuncts.Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 8 Lesson 2: NELS Approach: Initial A ssessmen t & Ac tionDefinitive airway, with the help of cuffed Endotracheal tube or cricothyroidotomy tube in trachea, may be required for airway patency and airway protection. Endotracheal intubation or front of neck access (Cricothyroidotomy) may be required in some patients with facial trauma, oedema of the airway or laryngeal stridor. breathing Look for signs of respiratory difficulty such as tachypnoea, sweating, central cyanosis, if accessory muscles of respiration are working, inadequate or laboured breathing. Determine the respiratory rate. High and increasing rates are markers of illness and a warning that the patient is deteriorating, while the low respiratory rate usually means that the patient is in a dangerous zone and needs immediate action, similarly, use of accessory muscles of respiration are indicative of the stressful respiratory situation. Observe movement of the thoracic wall for symmetry, abnormal breathing patterns like agonal or Kussmaul respirations, on percussion of the chest listen to unilateral dullness or resonance. (Priority) On auscultation of chest, air entry may be reduced or abnormal sounds may be heard and use pulse oximeter which will intimate the level of oxygenation. The patient's neck and chest examination are important to adequately assess Jugular venous engorgement (seen in acute severe asthma, heart failure, tension pneumothorax or cardiac tamponade), the position of the trachea (deviation to right or left indicates mediastinal shift e.g., tension pneumothorax, massive haemothorax). By looking and feeling by hand the chest wall, one can detect injuries that may compromise ventilation like fractured ribs. Tension pneumothorax must be relieved immediately by inserting a wide bore cannula in the second intercostal space in midclavicular line in children/5th intercostal space anterior to the midaxillary line in adults (needle thoracocentesis), to be followed by chest drain placement. Bronchospasm should be treated with bronchodilators. If breathing is inadequate, assisted ventilation must be started using bag mask device. If required, the airway can be secured using a supraglottic device, endotracheal intubation or surgical airway. It is vital to immediately diagnose and treat the life threatening conditions with breathing problems, such as acute severe asthma, pulmonary oedema, tension pneumothorax, and massive haemothorax. Circulation Adequate perfusion of vital organs is essential for optimal recovery of patients. It requires assessment and action as per the NELS approach. The circulatory status of a patient can be assessed by the level of consciousness, pulse rate and volume, capillary refill, skin colour and temperature, blood pressure and urine output. Apply requisite monitors (pulse oximeter, Non-invasive Blood Pressure (NIBP), Electrocardiography (ECG) End-tidal Carbondioxide (EtCO 2) if feasible). Secure vascular access, send appropriate investigations and initiate fluid administration.Manage the patient as per cause of shock.Patient in hypovolemic shock should receive warm isotonic crystalloids (preferably Ringer Lactate). Features suggestive of severe cardiac failure such as raised JVP, ankle oedema and lung crepitations should be indications for caution in fluid administration and expert opinion should be sought. Tension pneumothorax can compromise the patient's circulatory state and should be ruled out at the earliest possible stages in trauma patients in shock and urgently treated if diagnosed. Electrocardiography, pulse oximetry, and blood pressure measurements should be recorded at the earliest. In early shock, the blood pressure may be entirely normal, as compensatory mechanisms increase peripheral vascular resistance in response to the reduced cardiac output. A low diastolic BP suggests arterial vasodilatation (as in anaphylaxis or sepsis). A narrowed pulse pressure is suggestive of arterial vasoconstriction (cardiogenic shock or hypovolaemia). Action for a patient with risk to circulation is to insert one or more large (14 or 16 G) intravenous cannula and draw a blood sample for blood grouping, cross-matching and other haematological, biochemical, coagulation Lesson 2: & Ac tion 9and microbiological investigations. A rapid fluid challenge (over 5-10 minutes) of 500ml of a warmed crystalloid solution should be given to a patient followed by another 500ml. Fluid therapy should be guided by the response of the patient. Bleeding control must be kept on top priority. Early use of blood and blood products should be considered in hemorrhagic shock. However, smaller volumes (250 ml) should be given in patients with known cardiac failure and closely monitor for crepitation after each bolus and alternative means of improving tissue perfusion (e.g., inotropes or vasopressors) can be used in these patients. Reassess the pulse rate and BP regularly (every 5 minutes), target >100 mmHg systolic. However, in patients with suspected ongoing blood loss, keep systolic Blood Pressure around 90 mmHg to reduce further blood loss. If the patient shows no sign/transient improvement, meaning non-responder or transient responder, try to find the cause and treat. The effects of hypovolaemia can be alleviated by placing the patient in the supine position and by elevating the patient's legs. Look for signs of injury and external haemorrhage from wounds or collection in drains or evidence of concealed haemorrhage in the thoracic cavity, intraperitoneal or into the gut. Auscultate the heart sound for quality and rate. The diagnosis of cardiovascular compromise will determine the specific treatment but should be targeted at fluid replacement, haemorrhage control and restoration of tissue perfusion. Look for signs of immediately life-threatening conditions such as cardiac tamponade, massive or continuing haemorrhage, etc. and treat urgently. disability (Neurologic Evaluation) The level of consciousness can be assessed using the Glasgow Coma Score. Alternatively, rapid assessment can be done using CVPU score where the patient is graded as Conscious (C), Voice responsive (V), Pain responsive (P), or Unresponsive (U). Examine the pupils for size, equality, and reaction to light. Common causes of unconsciousness other than head injury include profound hypoxaemia, hypercapnia, cerebral hypoperfusion, metabolic causes like hypoglycaemia, poisoning or overdose of sedatives or analgesic drugs. Review the ABC to exclude hypoxaemia and hypotension.Look for drug-induced reversible causes of depressed consciousness and administer appropriate antagonist at the earliest possible. Hypoglycemia is one of the commonest cause of unconsciousness and sweating especially in a diabetic patient. Measure the blood glucose level. A decreased level of consciousness due to low blood glucose can be corrected quickly with glucose infusion. Exposure and Environment On exposure of front and back, see for any signs of trauma, bleeding wounds, skin reactions (rashes), needle marks, bite marks, etc. and if present, they must be taken into account for the diagnosis. While maintaining the dignity of the patient, clothing should be removed to allow a thorough physical examination to be performed. Body temperature can be recorded by touching the skin or using a thermometer when available. SCENaRIOS Scenario 1 A 35 year man is brought to the emergency department on a stretcher, restless, dusky and cold, breathing very slowly, snoring and not moving one side of the body. Based on the following observations, the patient in the scenario is critically ill requiring immediate lifesaving treatment. Assess: Does the patient have a patent airway? The answer is No - as he is snoring due to tongue fall obstructing the laryngeal inlet.Action: Open the airway using jaw thrust.Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 10 Lesson 2: NELS Approach: Initial A ssessmen t & Ac tionAssessment: Is the breathing inadequate? Does the patient require oxygen? The answer is Yes - (The patient is restless and cyanosed which are signs of inadequate breathing, hence hypoxia). Action: Assist breathing with the help of a bag mask or an another ventilation device. Start oxygen supplementation with a maximum percentage of inspired oxygen. Reassess for airway patency and breathing after implementation of above measures and above all improvement in oxygenation by checking oxygen saturation with help of pulse oximeter. Assess: Does the patient have a circulation (C) problem? The answer is yes. He is dusky and cold. Action: Raise the legs of the patient if clinically appropriate. Gain Intravenous (IV) access with two large bore cannulas. Immediately administer intravenous fluid to fill the circulatory volume while you seek the cause and treat it. Check blood pressure and pulse. Reassess for circulation: Skin colour, capillary refill, consciousness for improvement, pulse and blood pressure, urinary output if a catheter is in situ. Assess: Does the patient have a disability (D)/neurological problem? The answer is yes. Action: Ensure no further harm, maintain oxygenation and circulation and call for expert help at the earliest.Assess: Expose the patient to find any potential cause of illness, keep him warm and protect his spine. Reassess airway, breathing, circulation and maintain oxygenation and perfusion while appropriate steps are taken to find the cause of the physiological derangement of ABCD and definite care is provided. Scenario 2 A 37 year man has met with a road traffic accident. He is unconscious, has bleeding from mouth and injuries of extremities, bilateral deformed thighs. airway: assessment, action, and re-assessment Assess Airway: Is airway patent? The answer is no. The patient is unconscious, bleeding and gurgling from the mouth. Action: Oral suctioning is done to remove blood from the mouth till no more gurgling sound is heard.Reassess: Is airway patent? The answer is no. The patient is snoring.Action: Jaw thrust is performed and snoring sound disappears. An oropharyngeal airway (OPA) is inserted as gag reflex is absent. Assess: Is airway protected? The answer is no, as there is an absence of gag reflex and patient is tolerating OPA.Action: Insert a definitive airway with a cuffed endotracheal tube.Administer oxygen at all times to maintain SpO 2 more than 94%. Since this is a trauma patient, all airway manoeuvres should be performed with cervical spine stabilization using Manual In-Line Stabilisation (MILS) and cervical collar application. breathing: assessment, action and reassessment Assess respiratory rate and depth. Air entry is normal on chest auscultation. Percussion note is normal. Provide breaths if required with help of Bag Valve Mask (BVM) device with a reservoir bag filled with high flow of oxygen till a ventilator is attached. Maintain SpO 2> 94%. Circulation: assessment, action and re-assessment Assess: Pulse Rate (PR), Blood Pressure (BP) and capillary refill time. Is perfusion adequate? The answer is No as the PR is 140/min, BP of 80/60 mmHg, capillary refill A ssessmen t & Ac tion 11Action: Secure two wide bore (16G, 18G) IV lines, withdraw blood samples for blood grouping and cross- matching and other necessary investigations. Infuse warm IV fluid like Ringer Lactate (RL)/Normal Saline (NS): 1 liter boluses over 10-15 min. Control bleeding if present, from obvious external wounds by applying direct pressure and splint the injured extremities. After splinting, feel for the presence of a distal pulse, which should be present. Do Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) which is negative. Reassess: Is the perfusion adequate now? (After 1.5 liter RL has been infused and external bleeding has been controlled). Perfusion is adequate as the PR is 95/min, BP is 104/60, Capillary Refill Time (CRT) is 2 sec. disability: assessment, action and re-assessment Assess: Check neurological status using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), pupil size and reaction, lateralizing signs, blood glucose and drug effect. On assessment GCS is 8, pupils are bilateral equal and reacting, no lateralizing signs, Blood sugar is 92 mg/dl and no drug effect.Action: Take expert consultation while continuing to manage hypoxia, hypercarbia, and hypotension to prevent secondary brain injury. Exposure Expose the patient and look for signs of other injuries. Reassess patient: Airway: Patient is intubated and bilateral air entry is equal. Breathing: The patient is on a ventilator with oxygen saturation of 96% on FiO 2 0.6, chest moving equally on both sides. Circulation: BP 110/70 mmHg, PR 90/min and good volume. Disability: GCS is 8.Once life-threatening life and limb problems have been taken care of, a detailed history must be obtained from the patient or relative. The history should include: A Allergies M Medication (Anticoagulants, insulin and cardiovascular medications) p Previous medical/surgical history/pregnancy in child bearing age group females L Last meal (Time) E Events/Environment surrounding the injury. Enquire about exactly what happened? A detailed history is to be followed by a detailed head to toe, front and back examination. Special investigations and repeat assessment of the patient is done to assess improvement or deterioration to take further clinical action as appropriate. uNIvERSal PRECauTIONS For universal precautions, blood is assumed to be potentially infectious for blood borne pathogens. Protective barriers reduce the risk of exposure to blood, body fluids containing visible blood. Protective barriers include cap, protective eyewear, face mask, gown, gloves and shoe cover. The risk of nosocomial transmission of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hapatitis B Virus (HBV), and other blood borne pathogens can be minimized if a health-care worker takes care to prevent injuries when using needles and sharps. Steps to prevent nosocomial transmission: Never recap used needles by hand, do not remove used needles from disposable syringes by hand and do not bend or break used needles by hand. Place used disposable syringes and needles, scalpel blades, and other sharp items in puncture-resistant containers for disposal. Change gloves between patient contacts.Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 12 Lesson 2: NELS Approach: Initial A ssessmen t & Ac tionhand hygiene: Hands are the commonest way in which bacteria are transported and subsequently cause infection, especially in susceptible person. Good hand hygiene is the most important practice in reducing the transmission of infection. Healthcare Associated Infections (HCAI) during delivery of care can be avoided or reduced by proper hand washing. Observance of 'Your 5 moments for Hand Hygiene'. (WHO guidelines). 1. Before patient contact; 2. Before a clean/aseptic task; 3. After body fluid exposure risk; 4. After patient contact; and 5. After contact with patient surroundings can reduce the chances of transmission of microorganisms. CONCEPT OF TRIagE Triage is an important concept in Emergency and Trauma care. Understanding it clearly and including it in the clinical policy will enable the patients to be treated in the correct area of the hospital. Triage involves sorting of patients based on some objective criteria of presentation, the urgency of their needs for management and the resources available to provide that treatment. Usually coloured categories or numbers are assigned, black signifies deceased, red implies immediate care is very urgently required such as in the presence of severe and immediate risk to ABC requiring reversal, correction or safeguarding. The Fastest way to triage in the multiple causality events is to talk to the patient. Hence The step in the Triage begins with checking of responsiveness. If the response by replying to your question is clear and coherent, it means ABCD is all right at that moment. If the patient does not respond, check for breathing and carotid pulse simultaneously, if both respiration and carotid pulse are absent, start CPR and if signs of death are present, label the patient as Black. Perform ABCD assessment in the case of a patient who is responsive or unresponsive but there is presence of carotid pulse with or without breathing. Label the patient as RED if respiration is absent or respiration is present with obstructed breathing, Respiratory Rate is > 30 or < 8 per min. or there is absence of radial pulse or Capillary Refill > 2 sec or victim is not following simple commands. The yellow category is assigned if the risks to ABCD are developing and should be taken care after red category patients have been taken care. The green colour is assigned to walking and wounded patients who can be treated on an outpatient basis. Sometimes Blue colour is assigned to patients who are called expectant, meaning, these patients need lots of resources in form of manpower, time and equipment compared to red and yellow category patients, hence are given priority after red and yellow category patients. Usually, three objective assessment criteria are applied in the field for mass casualty incident which include Respiration (Airway and Breathing), Circulation and Disability. Ask him or her name by shouting and taping on both shoulder while facing the victim Cannot follow simple commandsIf does not respond No Respiration and carotid pulse CPR No carotid pulseRespiration Respiratory rate > 30/min or<8/min Present Red RedRespiratory rate < 30 Check perfusion Radial pulse present or capillary rell < 2 secondsCirculation Radial pulse absent or capillary rell > 2 second Check mental status Disability Can follow simple commands Yellow RedAlgorithm 2.1: Triage AssessmentLesson 2: NELS Approach: Initial A & Ac tion 13CONCEPT OF TEam A number of personnel are involved in the management of critically ill or injured patients. These include doctors, nurses and other paramedical and technical staff. All are part of a team and it is the entire team effort that determines the outcome. To work as an effective team, each team member should maintain correct and disciplined and clear communication with the team leader, there should be mutual respect for each other in the team. In a team, it is usually horizontal management; meaning ABCD assessment and action to treat are done simultaneously by different members of the team as directed by the team leader. Team leader thinks, assesses and manages ABCD vertically so that priority of managing ABCDE is maintained. This approach is demonstrated, learned and systematically practiced on NELS. The placement of each member of the team should be pre-planned. The equipment is checked for functionality and used in a systematic way. Team management in Emergency department (Ed) Effective teamwork plays an essential role in the overall outcome of the patients in the emergency situations. During an emergency, the main emphasis is to accomplish the maximum in minimum time within the constraints of available resources. For a good team, it is essential to work in a coherent and well-coordinated fashion. A team should consist of a team leader and team members, the number of whom can vary as per the availability of rescuers and the clinical situation. The team usually comprises of a team leader, a person who can take care of airway and breathing, a person for circulation (securing venous access, control of bleeding, and chest compression in case of arrest), a person for monitoring the vital parameters or use of defibrillator/AED and a person who is keeping the record of events. There are certain important components of an effective team: All the team members and the team leader should know their roles. The team leader should distribute v the roles to the team members based on their capability and area of expertise. All team members should be aware of their limitations and work for the benefit of the patient. The roles should be clearly defined. Effective communication is an essential part of any team dynamics. The message from the team leader v should be clear, precise and in a tone of mutual respect. There should be closed loop communication between the team leader and members and among the team members. Constructive intervention should be done when required. The message conveyed should be repeated and informed again at the end of the task. There should be debriefing at the end of the work. It should be done in a way taking care of mutual v respect and active participation of all team members. NON TEChNICal SkIllS It is equally important to learn and practice non technical skills while dealing with the emergency situations. One should train oneself in effective communication (nonverbal, verbal and written documentation) with co-workers as well as relatives of the patients. The Team spirit, leadership skills, decision making, knowledge of hospital written protocols and situation awareness are other non technical skills, which all personnel dealing with the critically ill patients, must be aware of, along with clinical management. CONCluSION This chapter focuses attention on the value of applying the simple but essential and important clinical approach to the systematic assessment and action. Look, Listen and Feel (inspection, percussion, palpation, and auscultation) to identify the risk to ABCD while ruling out important conditions as outlined in the NELS protocol and to treat these promptly and correctly.Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 14 Lesson 3: Oxygena tion: Airway and Brea thing In summary, NELS will give the skills to deal with serious illnesses and injuries. Throughout the course there are charts, exercises, discussions and practice sessions to impart the systematic approach to the practitioner and to provide the confidence in dealing with threats to life, limb, and organs. The continuous application of Assessment followed by Action, first on the overall basis and then on organ specific basis will achieve the best possible results for the patient and the clinical team.Lesson 3: Oxygena tion: Airway and Brea thing 15 AIRwAy AND BREAThINgoxygENATIoN: 3LESSoN CORE CONCEPTS Maintenance of oxygenation and tissue perfusion is the primary goal of resuscitation. v Assessment and management of the airway takes precedence over all other management. v Oxygen must be administered to all critically ill or injured patients. v Assessment is not a one-time requirement; reassessment is required as pathology may worsen. v ClINICal aNaTOmy aNd Phy SIOlOgy The airway is the passage through which the air passes during respiration. It may be subdivided into (a) upper airway - from the nares and lips to larynx (mouth, nose, nasopharynx, oropharynx, pharynx, and larynx); and (b) lower airway - tracheobronchial tree (trachea, bronchi, bronchioles and alveoli). OxygENa TION Oxygen is required to sustain life and it is carried through the upper airway to lungs. In the alveoli, it diffuses into the blood. Oxygen is carried in the blood combined with haemoglobin and dissolved in the plasma to reach all the tissues and finally in all the cells of the body for aerobic metabolism. The normal functioning of the heart helps to circulate oxygen enriched blood to all organs of the body. Hypoxaemia is low levels of oxygen in the blood and hypoxia is when oxygen supply is insufficient.ObjECTIvES Upon completion of the lesson the trainee would be able to: Maintain oxygenation v Identify airway patency and maintain it v Predict a difficult airway v Assess and manage airway problem v Assess and manage breathing problem vProvider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 16 Lesson 3: Oxygena tion: Airway and Brea thingIf on assessment, a patient is breathing, look for features suggestive of hypoxia such as restlessness, agitation, decreased consciousness level, cyanosis (late sign), low SpO2. Monitor oxygen saturation using a pulse oximeter. Give oxygen therapy if features are suggestive of hypoxia or oxygen saturation is below normal (SpO 2< 94%). Identify and treat the cause of hypoxia. If breathing is abnormal, assist ventilation with oxygen. The cause must be identified and treated. Clinical Pearls Remember that in a patient with suspected chest trauma, one should always ventilate \u0083 with caution. A tension pneumothorax should always be ruled out. Do a needle/tube chest decompression immediately if a tension pneumothorax is suspected. Administer oxygen to all critically ill and injured patients. \u0083 Oxygen Therapy Oxygen is a drug and administration of oxygen in a specific percentage more than that available in the air (i.e. 20.9%) is oxygen therapy, it is used to treat or prevent hypoxia. Every injured patient should receive supplemental oxygen, as acute blood loss can result in reduced oxygen transport resulting in tissue hypoxia. Oxygen must be administered to all critically ill patients irrespective of their underlying diagnosis. Measure Oxygen saturation SpO 2 by pulse oximeter at the earliest possible. Administer oxygen to treat or prevent hypoxia. Hypoxia presents a greater threat to life than hypercapnia, and the effects of prolonged severe hypoxia can be much more devastating in the critically ill. how and how much oxygen to be administered? In acutely ill patients, one should target oxygen saturation between 94-98%. In patients with known Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), one should target oxygen saturation between 88-92% in order to preserve hypoxic respiratory drive. Initiate oxygen therapy with a venturi mask at 24% oxygen at an oxygen flow of 3 L/min. However, if they are critically ill or in peri-arrest conditions, higher levels of supplemental oxygen aiming for higher saturations during their initial resuscitation phase should be given. In these situations, invasive or noninvasive ventilation may be indicated. Patients should be made to sit in upright posture as far as possible (or the most comfortable posture for the patient), unless there is a reason to immobilize the patient (e.g., skeletal or spinal trauma). If the patient is critically ill or in peri-arrest condition, a high flow of oxygen using a non-rebreathing mask with reservoir or Bag Valve Mask (BVM) device with oxygen flow 12 L/min should be given. In apnoeic patient, oxygen is given using BVM device with an oxygen flow of 12 L/min.If the patient has mild hypoxia with SpO 2 90-94%, administer oxygen using the nasal cannula, simple face mask or venturi mask.If hypoxia is moderate (SpO 2 75-89%), administer oxygen using a non-rebreathing mask or BVM device. If hypoxia is severe (SpO2 < 75%), administer oxygen using a non-rebreathing mask or BVM device. If the SpO2 does not improve, consider Non-invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (NPPV) in an alert patient. If the patient cannot tolerate NPPV or the patient is not alert, tracheal intubation should be performed and respiration needs to be assisted with oxygen enrichment. Equipment for oxygen delivery Oxygen source (cylinder or central pipeline), pressure gauge, flowmeter , a key to open cylinder. v Tubing connecting the oxygen source to a patient's oxygen administration device, with or without v humidifier bottle. Variable performance devices are those devices in which FiO v2 varies with the phase and pattern of respiration. These are patient-dependent devices. The fixed performance devices are patient-Lesson 3: Oxygena tion: Airway and Brea thing 17independent devices because by using these devices patient will receive a constant, predetermined inhaled oxygen percentage. Oxygen administration devices like a nasal prong, a simple face mask, a non-rebreathing mask which v are the variable performance devices while a venturi mask, a BMV device are the fixed performance devices. Advanced airways are a laryngeal mask airway, a combitube, an endotracheal tube and a tracheostomy v tube. Nasal prongs deliver oxygen through two cylindrical prongs that are placed into the nares of a patient. The oxygen flow rates for nasal prongs range from 1-4 litre/min. Oxygen flow at 1 litre/min will yield an oxygen delivery of 24%. Increasing the oxygen flow by 1 litre/min will increase the inspired oxygen concentration by 4% approximately. Nasal prongs are mainly used for the lower percentage of oxygen and long-term oxygen therapy and are ineffective for patients in respiratory distress or arrest. They may be used in patients with breathing difficulty, who are unable to tolerate the mask. Simple face masks fit over the nose and mouth with open side ports to allow air to get entrained and allow the escape of carbon dioxide. The mask fits around the head with the help of an elastic strap and tubing attached to an oxygen source. A patient can breathe through nose or mouth. A simple face mask can deliver a concentration of oxygen between 40-60% the oxygen flow rate is 5-8 L/min. Non-rebreathing masks are face masks with an attached oxygen reservoir bag and a one-way valve between the mask and bag; the patient inhales oxygen from the bag and exhaled air escapes through flutter valves on the side of the mask. It can deliver up to 90% oxygen when the flow is set to greater than 12 litre/min. The oxygen reservoir should be full prior to placing the mask on a patient and the flow rate is set so that the when the patient inhales, the bag does not collapse. Venturi masks provide a more predictable oxygen concentration to the patient. The masks are available in the following concentrations: 24%, 26%, 28%, colour-coded Nasal prongs Face mask Venturi mask Bag Valve Mask Figure 3.1: Equipment for Oxygen DeliveryProvider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 18 Lesson 3: Oxygena tion: Airway and Brea thingmask attachment or a single rotating device used. The oxygen flow required to achieve the appropriate concentration is defined on the mask attachment. Bag Valve Mask (BVM) device consists of a self-inflating bag, one-way valves and face mask. It can deliver up to 100 percent oxygen to a breathing or non-breathing victim when attached to an oxygen source. Squeezing the bag, when the victim inhales or when health care worker wants to give breath, to the patient, helps to deliver oxygen in respiratory depression. Oxygen should be attached and the flow rate of oxygen should be set at least 12 litre/min. An oxygen tent, oxygen hood and incubators are used to provide oxygen therapy to neonates and infant (Discussed in pediatric emergency) aIRW ay ObSTR uCTION A blockage or obstruction in the airway may partially or totally prevent the air from getting into the lungs. It may occur at any point from the mouth down to the trachea and bronchial tree. Airway obstruction may be partial or complete. Patients with complete airway obstruction rapidly get hypoxic, while in partial obstruction, the onset of hypoxia may be insidious. Upper airway obstruction occurs in the area from nose and lips to the larynx. Lower airway obstruction occurs in the area between larynx and lungs, generally caused by increased resistance in the bronchioles leading to a reduction in the amount of air inhaled with each breath. Causes of upper airway obstruction Intraluminal mechanical obstruction due to the presence of blood, vomitus, foreign body, secretions v or tumor. Tongue falling back against the posterior pharyngeal wall. This is seen in patients with reduced conscious v level as in head injury, the effect of drugs and toxins e.g. benzodiazepines, opiates and alcohol.External compression of the airway caused by hematoma, tumor or a large goiter. v Swelling and edema of the soft tissues of pharynx and larynx following trauma (e.g. blunt trauma to v maxilla, mandible, larynx, burns, abscess). Allergy/angioedema. v Artificial airways, if present may get displaced or blocked due to secretions or kinking. v Tracheal stenosis following prolonged mechanical ventilation. v Neuromuscular disorders such as myasthenia gravis, Guillain Barre syndrome. v Paralysis of the vocal cord. v Causes of lower airway obstruction Asthma v Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) that include chronic bronchitis and emphysema. v Bronchiolitis v The signs and symptoms suggestive of an obstructed airway Inability to speak clearly and in complete sentence. v Noisy breathing. v Laboured breathing: Suprasternal, intercostal, and subcostal retraction, increased use of accessory v muscles of respiration, paradoxical chest and abdominal movements ('see-saw' respirations).Breathing may be rapid, shallow, or slow. v The ominous and paradoxical absence of airway sounds, no air movement can be felt, breath sounds v are absent on auscultation.Lesson 3: Oxygena tion: Airway and Brea thing 19Hand-to-the-throat choking sign. v Agitation/restless/fidgeting, confusion due to hypoxia. v Bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membrane (cyanosis) may occur due to hypoxia (a late v sign of hypoxia). PREdICTINg a dIFFICul T aIRW ay Several factors such as facial hair, shape of jaw, abnormal or absent teeth, limited mouth opening, large tongue, short neck, high larynx, pregnancy, soft tissue swelling as a result of burns, allergy/angioedema, infection and haematoma, maxillofacial or mandibular trauma, cervical spine injury or arthritis and obesity may cause difficulty in managing the airway. To predict difficulty in bag-mask ventilation, one may use the mnemonic MoANS or BoNES. moans M v ask seal difficult or impossible (e.g. facial abnormality) o v besity (BMI >26) or upper airway Obstruction A v dvanced age N v o teeth S v norer bones B v earded individual o v besity (BMI > 26) N v o teeth E v lderly (age > 55 years) S v norer Patients having 2 predictors are likely to have difficult mask ventilation. The mnemonic \"lEmON\" represents five simple and rapid assessment methods, which are helpful in assessing for potentially difficult laryngoscopy and intubation L v ook for anatomic features suggestive of potential difficulties such as a short neck, obesity, facial hair, edentulous patient, buck teeth, high arched palate, big tongue, facial or neck trauma or swelling, etc. E v xamination of the airway anatomy the 3-3-2 Normal rule. Full mouth opening can accommodate 3 (patient's) fingerbreadths. Distance between the mentum and the hyoid bone is 3 fingerbreadths. It measures the ability of the mandible to accommodate the tongue. The distance between the top of the thyroid cartilage and the mandible (floor of mouth) is 2 finger breadth. This measurement externally assesses for a high larynx. M v allampati classification of the oropharyngeal view. It indicates the amount of space within the oral cavity to accommodate the laryngoscope and tracheal tube. To perform a Mallampati evaluation, have the patient seated, head protruding forward mimicking the sniffing position, with mouth wide open, sticking the tongue out without phonation. The observer's eye should be at the level of the patient's mouth. Observe the degree to which faucial pillars, soft palate, uvula and hard palate are visible. In supine patients, the Mallampati score can be estimated by asking the patient to open the mouth fully and protrude the tongue; in comatose patients use a tongue blade. It has been classified as Class I: soft palate, uvula, fauces, pillars visible (easy laryngoscopic view of glottis); Class II: soft palate, uvula, fauces visible (easy laryngoscopic view of glottis); Class III: soft palate, the base of uvula visible Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 20 Lesson 3: Oxygena tion: Airway and Brea thing(difficult laryngoscopic view of glottis); Class IV: hard palate only visible (impossible view of glottis using conventional laryngoscopy). o v bstruction of the airway: If evidence of obstruction is present, one has to find out whether the obstruction is above, at or below the level of glottis? Is the obstruction fixed or mobile? How rapidly is the obstruction progressing? N v eck mobility: Can the patient flex neck (rest chin on chest) and extend the head at atlantoaxial joint (look at the ceiling)? Normal movements are flexion >25-30\u00ba, extension >80-85\u00ba and rotation >70-75\u00ba. IS ThE aIRW ay PaTENT? (Refer to algorithm 3.1) Assess: The quickest method to assess airway and breathing is by talking to the patient and getting an appropriate verbal response. Look for signs suggestive of airway obstruction (suprasternal, intercostal, and subcostal retraction, increased use of accessory muscles of respiration, paradoxical chest and abdomen movement), signs of airway injury (haematoma), swelling in neck/mouth. Listen for noisy breathing, snoring, stridor.Feel for air movement (in complete airway obstruction there may be a total absence of airway sounds, no air movement can be felt and breath sounds are absent on auscultation. However, a transient tracheal tug, supraclavicular and intercostal indrawing, paradoxical chest and abdomen movement may be seen until frank respiratory arrest supervenes.) Action: If there are signs of partial or complete airway obstruction, take measures, depending on the cause, to relieve this obstruction: If there are secretions, blood, vomitus, etc. in the mouth, it should be cleared using a suction device. v Remove a foreign body, if visible, in the mouth. In an unresponsive patient, airway obstruction may occur, due to tongue falling back against the v posterior pharyngeal wall. Simple maneuvers such as head tilt-chin lift and jaw thrust may help in relieving airway obstruction. Use of airway devices such as oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal airway may be considered. Advanced v airway device such as laryngeal mask airways or tracheal tube may be required in some cases to maintain airway patency. A simple Heimlich maneuver may be useful in relieving airway obstruction due to choking. v It should be remembered that in patients in whom trauma is suspected, no airway maneuver or v procedure should be done prior to taking measures for cervical spine protection such as Manual In- Line Stabilization (MILS). In these patients jaw thrust maneuver is done, if required, and head tilt-chin lift maneuver is avoided.Mallampati class tion: Airway and Brea thing 21A patient with airway obstruction may have positioned himself in the best breathing position for v optimal airflow, thus making this patient supine may precipitate the loss of airway. Patients with lower airway obstruction require treatment with bronchodilator albuterol by multidose v inhaler or nebulizer; and oral or intravenous corticosteroids depending on the severity. If there is no airway obstruction or it has already been taken care of, the airway needs to be protected. Airway Patent1 Airway Protected 2YES YES Trauma? NO Airway adjuncts Oxygen therap 3.1: Assessment Management Abbreviations: Foreign Body (FB); Manual In-Line Stabilization (MILS); Head tilt chin lift (HT-CL) IS ThE aIRW ay PROTECTEd? Assess: For Gag reflex, is it intact? The gurgling sound, drooling, an absence of swallowing reflex, unconscious patient, tolerating oropharyngeal airway, all suggest that airway is not protected. Action: Aim is to protect the airway of the patient and prevent aspiration: Recovery position (lateral) may be given to the patients who have a reduced conscious level (e.g. alcohol v excess). It should not be given to the patients in whom trauma is suspected. This position lowers the risk of aspiration and protects the airway. The tongue and jaw are pushed forward, maintaining airway patency and allow passage for secretions or vomitus out of the mouth, with the help of gravity. The head end of the bed or trolley may be lowered to allow gravity to drain secretions away from the v glottic opening to prevent aspiration.Patients who are unconscious, in whom airway reflexes are not intact, require a tracheal intubation v (definitive airway), so that, there is no soiling of the airway with gastric contents. A definitive airway is defined as a tube placed in the trachea with the cuff inflated below the vocal cords, the tube connected to some form of oxygen-enrichment and assisted ventilation device and the airway secured in place with a tape. Definitive airway devices are an endotracheal tube and a tracheostomy tube.Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 22 Lesson 3: Oxygena tion: Airway and Brea thingIndications for placing a definitive airway include Patients with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score < 9. v Apnoea v Unstable midface trauma, Airway injuries v Flail chest or lung contusion causing respiratory failure v High aspiration risk with no gag reflex v Inability to otherwise maintain an airway or oxygenation v Tracheal intubation in a trauma patient with suspected cervical spine injury should be done after v applying Manual In-Line Stabilization (MILS). If a tracheal tube cannot be inserted, ventilation via advanced airway adjuncts such as a laryngeal mask airway may be attempted as a bridge to a definitive airway. If attempts to intubate have failed and ventilation is not possible using other advanced airway adjuncts v or by bag valve mask device. Then, in such a case, a surgical cricothyroidotomy must be performed immediately. Clinical Pearls An airway that appears uncomplicated may deteriorate rapidly as pathology worsens. \u0083 One must anticipate and recognize such situations (e.g. upper airway burns, anaphylaxis, penetrating injuries to the neck) and act promptly and correctly. Watch for signs of airway deterioration; these require urgent intervention. An increasing \u0083 work of breathing, fatigue, decreasing conscious state, restlessness and cyanosis (late sign) are suggestive of a deteriorating airway. A simple airway may be rendered difficult due to improper positioning, non- availability of \u0083 proper equipment and lack of trained personnel.Assess to diagnose the potential for a difficult airway and be prepared (lack of indicators of \u0083 a difficult airway is not an assurance).Maintaining oxygenation is most important. It is not wise to pursue attempts to place a \u0083 tracheal tube rather than maintaining oxygenation.Recognize an immediate need for a surgical airway in cannot ventilate/cannot intubate \u0083 scenario. bREa ThINg aSSESSmENT aNd maNagEmENT (Refer to algorithm 3.2 and 3.3) Once airway patency and airway protection have been taken care, next step is to assess and manage the breathing. Check if the patient is breathing. This can be simply done by observing the chest rise for five to ten seconds. In a patient who is not breathing (gasping is also considered as not breathing), check for the presence of a carotid pulse. If the carotid pulse is present, give breaths (10-12 breaths/min) using a bag-valve-mask device, preferably with a reservoir bag. Attach oxygen at 12 litre/min flow rate. However, if the carotid pulse is absent, immediately start Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). To follow the Basic Cardiopulmonary Life Support and Comprehensive Cardiopulmonary Life Support guidelines. (Refer to Algorithm 6.1 and 6.3). If the patient is breathing, you need to assess whether the breathing is normal or abnormal. In an adult, the normal respiratory rate is between 12-20 breaths/minute. assessment of breathing Look: Is the patient's colour normal or appears cyanosed? Does he look distressed? Is the chest wall movement normal and symmetrical? Is the patient using accessory muscles of respiration? Is the respiratory rate normal or slow or fast? Is breathing pattern regular or irregular?Lesson 3: Oxygena tion: Airway and Brea thing 23Listen: Can patient speak in a full sentence? Is the breathing noisy? On auscultation, check that the breath sounds are bilateral, equal on both sides or not. Feel: Is the trachea central? Is there distension of neck veins? Check for soft tissues (surgical emphysema/ crepitus) and bony structure of the chest wall for integrity.

It may be seen in metabolic acidosis.Abbreviations: Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR); Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 24 Lesson 3: Oxygena tion: Airway and Brea thinghypoventilation: v Decrease in ventilation with a resultant rise in arterial PaCO2. Cheyne-Stokes: v In this breathing pattern, the tidal volume is initially shallow, gets deeper and then gets shallow again, this shallow-deep-shallow pattern is followed by periods of significant apnoea (30 seconds or longer), then the cycle starts over. This may be seen in stroke, traumatic brain injuries, brain tumours, carbon monoxide poisoning, and metabolic encephalopathy. Biot's: v In this breathing pattern there are periods or \"clusters\" of rapid respirations of near equal depth followed by regular periods of apnoea. Such type of a breathing pattern may be seen when there is damage to the medulla oblongata by stroke or trauma, pressure on the medulla due to uncal or tentorial herniation. It may be seen in cases of prolonged opioid abuse as well. Kussmaul's: v In this, breathing is laboured, deep and rapid. Such type of a breathing pattern may be seen in the late stages of a severe metabolic acidosis such as diabetic ketoacidosis and renal failure.Apneustic: v In this breathing pattern, there is a prolonged inspiratory phase followed by a prolonged expiratory phase. Such type of breathing pattern may be seen in cases of damage to the upper part of the pons, which is the upper portion of the brain stem. Ataxia: v The breathing pattern is irregular with irregular pauses and increasing episodes of apnoea. As breathing deteriorates further, ataxic respirations begin to merge with agonal respirations. Such type of a breathing pattern may be seen in cases of damage to the medulla oblongata secondary to trauma or stroke. This breathing pattern indicates a very poor prognosis. SCENaRIOS Scenario 1 A 30 year man, has met with a road traffic accident, he is unconscious, has blood stained secretions in the mouth, gurgling and snoring sound is heard. Assess: Is the airway patent? The answer is no because he has bloody secretions in the mouth, the gurgling and snoring sound are heard. Action: Since, he is a trauma victim, ask an assistant to apply MILS. An oropharyngeal suction is done, jaw thrust is given to open the airway. The airway is now patent. To maintain airway patency, insert an oropharyngeal airway (has an absent gag reflex). Assess: Is the airway protected? The answer is no because he is unconscious and his gag reflex is absent. Action: Prepare for tracheal intubation with MILS as the airway protection is needed.Assess: Is he breathing normally? After tracheal intubation, respiratory effort appears to be adequate. Scenario 2 An 18 year boy is assaulted with a bamboo stick. He is conscious, has extensive facial injuries and is bleeding from mouth and nose. He is spitting blood out of his mouth. Assess: Is the airway patent? May be not, as there is blood in oral and nasal cavity which can be potential threat to patency of the airway. Attach the monitors. Action: Since he is a trauma victim, ask an assistant to apply a cervical collar and MILS whenever required. Perform oropharyngeal suction and administer oxygen (according to SpO2 measurement). After oral suction patient is now talking, means that the airway is patent. Assess: Is the airway protected? The answer is yes as he is able to spit blood and able to talk.Lesson 3: Oxygena tion: Airway and Brea thing 25Assess: Is he breathing normally? The answer is yes suggested by regular chest movements and ability to talk clearly. Assess and reassess frequently the neck and chest for life threatening injuries and GCS for neurological trauma.Caution/Risk: If he loses consciousness, the clinician should be prepared to support his airway and breathing. Scenario 3 A 57 year man has difficulty in breathing, He is conscious, has laboured breathing, has supraclavicular and intercostal indrawing and is unable to speak in a full sentence. He has a past history of coronary artery disease and CABG was done four year back. There is no history of trauma. Assess: Is the airway patent? The answer is yes. Assess: Is the airway protected? The answer is yes. Assess: Is he breathing normally? The Answer is no as he has laboured breathing, supraclavicular and intercostal indrawing and is unable to speak in a full sentence. Action: Administered high flow O2 at 12 litre/min through the non-rebreathing mask. Applied the vital sign monitors.Assess: Respiratory rate is 38/min, pulse rate is 142/min, BP is 170/104 mmHg, SpO 2 is 90%, chest bilateral basal fine crepitations are present.Action: Keep in propped up position, give a high flow oxygen through a non-rebreathing mask. If required support ventilation by using Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (NPPV) or Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (IPPV). Re-assess: Identify and treat the cause. Scenario 4 A 20 year man starts coughing while eating. He is not able to speak and has stridor. He is seen to be clutching his neck. Assess: Is the airway patent? The answer is no, probably a food bolus is obstructing the airway. Action: Ask \"Are you choking?\" He nods to say \"yes\". Inform him and give Heimlich manoeuvre to relieve the obstruction. After four abdominal thrusts, food bolus comes out, the airway is now patent. Assess: After the manoeuvre is the airway protected? The answer is yes. Assess: After the manoeuvre, check: Is he breathing normally? The answer is yes. Scenario 5 45 year morbidly obese lady, was operated for cholecystectomy, a day before. In the post-operative ward, after some sedative medication, her breathing becomes laboured, the monitor shows fall in oxygen saturation (88%), she is conscious and oriented but restless. Assess: Is the airway patent? The answer is no as there is an obstructed breathing. Action: Insert a nasopharyngeal airway (to relieve obstruction, as the gag reflex is present), Administer oxygen using a venturi mask (50% oxygen). Assess: Obstructed sound disappears, can breathe comfortably. The oxygen saturation improves to 95%. Assess: Is the airway protected? The answer is yes. Assess: Is she breathing normally? The answer is yes.Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 26 Lesson 3: Oxygena tion: Airway and Brea thingScenario 6 A 29 year young man comes to the emergency room with difficulty in breathing for the last one day. He has a history of fever, sore throat and cough for the last 2 days. He appears distressed and is using accessory muscles of respiration. He is a known asthmatic for the last four year taking salbutamol inhaler, off and on. general appearance: Looks distressed Assess Airway: Talk to the patient. He is able to speak coherently but speaks with difficulty in interrupted sentences with frequent pauses. Upper airway is patent and protected. Assess Breathing: He appears distressed and is using accessory muscles of respiration, respiratory rate is 30/min, the trachea is central. On auscultation, air entry is diminished bilaterally with a widespread expiratory wheeze. SpO 2 is 91% on room air. Action: Give oxygen by the nasal prongs at 4 litre/min. Give Salbutamol and Ipratropium at 2-3 min intervals.Secure a vascular access and administer the drugs (Hydrocortisone IV mg/kg body weight).Antimicrobials: Intramuscular Injections of Ampicillin (25-50 mg/kg/day) 400 mg 6 hourly. Gentamicin 60 mg once a day and Cloxacillin 400 mg 6 hourly.After acute phase recovery, follow by oral antimicrobial: Ampicillin (125 mg/5 ml suspension) 50-100 mg/kg/day, per oral in divided doses every 6 hourly, maximum 12 gm per day. Assess Circulation: The patient is warm and sweaty, capillary refill is <2 seconds, pulse rate is 110 per minute, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg, the heart sounds are normal on auscultation.Action: There appears to be no circulatory problem. Tachycardia is probably due to hypoxia.Assess Disability: The neurological status of the patient is intact.Action: No further action is currently required for the neurological status.Reassess: Patient has symptomatically improved.Airway: Patent.Breathing: Respiratory rate is 18/min; SpO 2 is 94% on nasal prongs with oxygen 3 litre/min.

Equipment: Suction catheters (rigid or soft plastic) of different sizes, wall mounted or electric suction.procedure: Use universal precautions. Wear protective gloves and face mask. The rigid suction catheter is used to suction the mouth and oropharynx. The rigid catheter should be inserted only as far as one can see. It may be used in an infant or a child, but must observe caution so as not to touch the posterior wall of oral cavity. Soft catheters are useful for suctioning the nasopharynx or in other situations where the rigid catheter cannot be used. Connect the suction catheter to a suction tubing attached to a wall mounted or electric driven suction source. Check suction pressure by blocking the tip or side-port on the catheter. (Suction pressure is set usually at -100 to -120 mmHg for adults, -90 to -110 mmHg for children, and -50 to -90 mmHg for infants). Under direct vision insert the catheter into the oral cavity, block the side port with your thumb or finger to suction and gently withdraw the catheter. Complications: Trauma, coughing, gagging, and bradycardia due to vagal stimulation. SkIll 2: hEad TIlT-ChIN lIFT maNEuvER purpose: To open the upper airway.procedure: One hand is placed on the patient's forehead and gentle, firm, backward pressure is applied using the palm of the hand. The fingers of other hand are placed under the bony part of the chin. Lift the chin forward and support the jaw, helping to tilt the head back. This maneuver lifts the patient's tongue away from the posterior wall of the pharynx and provides an adequate airway. Caution: Do not do head tilt in a trauma patient with a suspected cervical spine injury. SkIll 3: j aW ThR uST purpose: To open the upper airway. It is safe to use in a trauma victim with a suspected cervical spine injury. procedure: Grasp the angles of the patient's lower jaw, and lift with both the hands, one on each side displacing the mandible forward. This is used in the cervical injury. This maneuver also lifts the patient's tongue away from the posterior wall of pharynx and provides an adequate airway. Caution: Inpatient with facial fractures, it may not be possible to do a jaw thrust. Head Tilt-Chin Lift Flexible RigidFigure 4.1: Suction CatheterLesson 4: 4: ORO-PhaR yNgEal aIRW ay purpose: To open the upper airway in patient with absent gag reflex. It displaces the tongue anteriorly and relieves soft tissue obstruction of the airway. procedure: Choose an oropharyngeal airway of appropriate size by measuring the distance from the corner of patient's mouth to the angle of the jaw. Open the mouth using a cross finger or scissor finger technique. Insert the airway upside down with its tip pointing towards the roof of mouth; as it approaches the posterior wall of the pharynx, rotate it through 180\u00b0 into anatomical position, with flange resting against lips or teeth. Alternatively, a tongue depressor may be used to push the tongue forward and down. The airway is then inserted in anatomical position following the normal curvature of the oropharynx, with flange resting on lips or teeth. Suction should always be available to clear the airway of any visible secretions or foreign body. Complication: Airway trauma, intolerance requiring removal, vomiting/laryngospasm in a patient with intact gag reflex, incorrect size or placement can potentially exacerbate airway obstruction. Caution: It should not be used in a patient with gag reflex and never tie/tape it on patient' s face. SkIll 5: NaSOPhaR yNgEal aIRW ay purpose: To maintain the airway patent in patients with an intact gag reflex. procedure: Choose a nasopharyngeal airway of an appropriate size by measuring the tip of the patient's nose to their earlobe. The diameter of the airway should not be so large that it causes sustained blanching of the nostrils. The diameter of patient's smallest finger can be used as a guide. Lubricate the end of the tube well with lubricating jelly. When inserting the airway, slightly evert the tip of the nose with the free hand and gently insert it into the patient's nostril with the bevel facing the nasal septum. Advance the device carefully along the floor of the nasopharynx, following its natural curvature until the flange rests against the nostril. Complication: Epistaxis, incorrect size or placement will compromise effectiveness, risk of misplacement into the cranial cavity through fractured cribriform plate. Figure 4.2: Jaw Thrust Figure 4.3: Oro-Pharyngeal Airway Nasopharyngeal airwayProvider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 32 Lesson 4: Skills :Airway and Brea thingSkIll 6: b ag maSk vENTIla TION purpose: To assist or provide ventilation. Equipment: Bag valve mask device, appropriate size face mask, oxygen @ 12 L/min attached to bag-mask valve device. procedure: Apply the mask on the patient's face. Create an airtight seal between the mask and his face using one hand (E-C clamp technique) and squeeze the bag with the other hand to provide ventilation. If unable to create a leak proof seal with one hand, then two persons work together. The first person applies the mask to the patient's face, performing a jaw-thrust maneuver and ascertaining a tight seal with both hands. The second person provides ventilation by squeezing the bag with both hands. The adequacy of ventilation is assessed by observing the patient's chest rise. Complication: Distention of stomach due to the wrong holding of a mask. This may lead to regurgitation of gastric contents. SkIll 7: maNual IN-lINE ST abIlIza TION purpose: To prevent the cervical spine movement during performance of a procedure such as tracheal intubation, during transport, applying cervical collar or during cricothyroidotomy. procedure: Aim is to splint cervical vertebrae/neck which is the most mobile part of the body to avoid further damage to cervical spine. Splinting is done by fixing the patient's head and chest using different hands and arm positions. In one of the methods, the mastoid processes of the patient are firmly grasped, to prevent movement of the cervical spine during tracheal intubation. Force is applied to counteract the lifting force of the laryngoscope during the tracheal intubation to minimize displacement of the cervical spine. Some of the ways to protect the cervical spine are shown in the above figures. Figure 4.4: Bag mask ventilation Figure 4.5: Manual In-Line Stabilization SkIll 8: TRa ChEal INTuba TION purpose: All indications of having a definitive airway. Equipment: Appropriately sized endotracheal tube (disposable, single use), a tie to secure it, laryngoscope (with alternative blade size available), stylets, gum-elastic bougie, laryngeal mask airway. BVM device connected to a high flow oxygen source, suction.Lesson 4: Skills :Airway and Brea thing 33procedure: Prepare drugs beforehand, confirm patient trolley can be tilted; suction (wide bore rigid sucker) is available. Preoxygenate the patient with a tight-fitting mask, for at least 3 minutes. Place the patient's head in the sniffing position (if no cervical spine injury), or in a neutral position with the application of MILS if the cervical spine injury is suspected. Open mouth and inspect the oral cavity, remove any dentures or debris if present. Hold the laryngoscope in the left hand and introduce it into the right side of the patient's mouth, gently sweeping the patient's tongue to the left. Elevate the laryngoscope to lift the mandible without levering on the teeth. The end of the blade should rest in the epiglottic vallecula, allowing direct visualization of the larynx. Suction the airway if and when required. Advance the tracheal tube until the cuff is seen to pass through the vocal cords. Inflate the cuff. Connect BVM and commence ventilation. Confirm tube placement (capnography, auscultation). Secure ETT adequately with a cloth tie or tape. Complication: Trauma to mucous membrane, teeth, bradycardia (due to vagal stimulation), failed intubation, oesophageal or right main bronchus intubation, excessive leak, aspiration, cuff leak and tube occlusion. SkIll 9: b aCkWaRd, uPW aRd, RIghTW aRd PRESSuRE laryngeal visualization in case of difficult intubation. procedure: This is performed by the clinician performing laryngoscopy. The thyroid cartilage is grasped between the thumb and index or middle finger. Pressure is applied in the backwards direction (larynx abuts the cervical vertebrae), in the upward direction (larynx is pushed superiorly) and rightward direction (lateral movement of the larynx). Complication: Incorrect application may worsen the glottic view in laryngoscopy, potential for airway trauma. SkIll 10: SuPRa glOTTIC dEvICES (Sgd) purpose: Impending or actual loss of airway patency or protection, where advanced airway management is necessary, but the clinician is unable to secure airway through tracheal intubation. It is a rescue airway in the failed intubation algorithm. Classic laryngeal mask airway (C-lma) procedure: The optimal head position for insertion of the Classic Laryngeal Mask Airway (C-LMA) is sniffing position. Choose the correct size of LMA usually size 3 for females and size 4 for males. Check the LMA cuff for leaks. Deflate and lubricate the posterior surface of LMA cuff with water-soluble jelly. Hold the LMA with the dominant hand in a pen holding manner, with the index finger placed at the junction of the cuff and the shaft and the LMA opening oriented over the tongue. Pass the LMA Figure 4.6: Tracheal Intubation BURP Classic Emergency Life Suppor t 34 Lesson 4: Skills :Airway and Brea thingbehind the upper incisors, with the shaft parallel to the patient's chest and the index finger pointing toward the intubator. Push the LMA into position along the palatopharyngeal curve, with the index finger maintaining pressure on the tube and guiding the LMA into the final position. Inflate the cuff with the correct volume of air (indicated on the shaft of the LMA). Check the placement of the LMA by applying bag-mask-to-tube ventilation. Visually observe chest excursions with ventilation. Intubating laryngeal mask airway (Ilma) ILMA is designed to serve as a conduit for intubation. It consists of anatomically curved short stainless steel tube, sheathed in silicone, bonded to a laryngeal mask and a guiding stainless steel handle. ILMA size 3, 4 and 5 can accommodate size 7, 7.5 and 8 mm tracheal tube respectively. procedure: Choose the correct size of ILMA usually size 3 for females and size 4 for males. Check the ILMA cuff for leaks. Deflate the cuff and lubricate the posterior surface of the cuff with water-soluble jelly. Hold the ILMA by the metal handle. Open the patient's mouth and insert the mask into the mouth with its posterior surface on the hard palate, push it back against the hard palate. Slide the mask backward, following the curve of the palate and posterior pharyngeal wall. Swing the ILMA into place. Inflate the cuff to a pressure of 60 cm of water. Ventilate the patient with the ILMA. A slight adjustment in position may be necessary. Lubricate the tracheal tube and insert it through the ILMA to appropriate depth and inflate its cuff. Resume ventilation. Check for the correct placement. To remove ILMA, deflate the ILMA cuff and remove 15 mm adaptor from the ET tube. Use the obturator to keep the ET tube at its correct depth while the ILMA is removed. As soon as possible, grasp the ET tube at the mouth. The ILMA is removed entirely. Reattach the 15-mm adaptor and resume ventilation. Check correct placement and secure the ET tube with adhesive tape. ProSeal laryngeal mask airway (Plma) The LMA ProSeal has an addition of a channel for the suctioning of gastric contents. procedure: Choose the correct size of PLMA usually size 3 for females and size 4 for males. Check the LMA cuff for leaks. Deflate and lubricate the posterior surface of PLMA cuff with water-soluble jelly. Insert it like the classic LMA or after attaching it to a rigid insertion handle, it can be inserted like an ILMA. Complication: Failure to provide an adequate airway or ventilation, can precipitate vomiting and aspiration in a patient with intact airway reflexes, airway trauma or patient intolerance. SkIll 11: NEEdlE CRICOThyROIdOTOmy purpose: To maintain oxygenation when there is failure to obtain an airway in situations such as in trauma with oral, pharyngeal, or nasal hemorrhage. Rescue airway when LMA and endotracheal intubation are ineffective or contraindicated and cannot intubate, cannot oxygenate situations. Equipment: A catheter (10-14 gauge). A saline filled 5ml syringe, oxygen source with appropriate connector/jet ventilator set. procedure: Extend the patient's neck to optimize identification of anatomy and ease of procedure in non trauma patient. Identify the cricothyroid membrane and stabilize it with the non-dominant hand. Palpate the membrane with the index finger of the non-dominant hand and stabilise the trachea with the thumb Intubating Mask Airway ProSeal Laryngeal mask airwayLesson 4: Skills :Airway and Brea thing 35and middle finger. Hold a 5 ml syringe (containing 1-2ml saline) connected to a 14 G cannula in the dominant hand, with the fingers between the flange and the plunger. Filling the 5 ml syringe with 1-2 ml of saline allows demonstration of the bubbles, endpoint of when the airway is entered. Insert the needle through the skin at an angle of 45 degrees in a caudal direction. In order for the cannula to reach the airway, a more perpendicular approach may be needed. Aspirate as you continuously advance the needle- cannula unit into the airway. Stop advancing once the air is aspirated, ensuring the cannula tip in the trachea. The endpoint is a free aspiration of air. Stabilize the cannula hub with the non-dominant hand and then release the plunger of the syringe held by your dominant hand. If the tip of the cannula is incorrectly placed the plunger will be sucked back into the syringe barrel by the vacuum created by aspirating outside the airway. The plunger will stay in position if the cannula is correctly placed in the airway. Place the dominant hand underneath the syringe, holding the needle in a pencil grip with the hand resting against the chin or neck to immobilise the cannula. Advance the cannula over the needle into the trachea using your non-dominant hand and remove trochar. It should advance as easily as an IV. Do not remove the needle before you advance the cannula otherwise the cannula will kink. Ensure the cannula is held securely in position at all times. Using a syringe with 1-2 ml saline, connect to the cannula and repeat the full free aspiration of air from the cannula. Again, a lack of plunger recoil confirms airway placement. If the initial aspiration fails then slightly withdraw the cannula while aspirating \u2014 free aspiration of air suggests that the cannula tip was impacted against the posterior tracheal wall. Attach an appropriate oxygen supply source and provide oxygenation.Caution: It is a simple, life saving technique but does not provide a definitive airway. It does not allow for effective ventilation, leads to hypercapnia and must be followed by definitive airway. There may be a time lag before SpO 2 improves following commencement of effective transtracheal oxygenation. Compications: Pneumothorax, surgical emphysema from jet placement of cannula, danger of puncturing posterior wall of the trachea and into the esophagus. SkIll 12: SuRgICal CRICOThyROIdOTOmy purpose: It provides a definitive airway that can be used to ventilate the patient's lungs. Performed in with increasing hypoxaemia. Equipment: Scalpel - short and rounded, small (size 6 and 7 mm ID) cuffed tracheal or tracheostomy tube with cotton tape, tracheal hook, 10 ml, ventilation device.Needle cricothyroidotomy Figure cricothyroidotomyProvider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 36 Lesson 4: Skills :Airway and Brea thingprocedure: Identify the cricothyroid membrane. Give a stab incision through the skin and membrane, enlarge incision with blunt dissection. Give caudal traction on cricoid cartilage with the tracheal hook, then insert the tracheal tube and inflate the cuff. Ventilate with low-pressure oxygen source and verify tube position and pulmonary ventilation. Complications: Aspiration (blood), creation of a false passage into the tissues, subglottic SkIll 13: hEImlICh maNEuvER OR abdOmINal ThRuSTS This maneuver lifts diaphragm and creates positive pressure in the thorax which causes the foreign object to be expelled from the airway. Always call for emergency help. purpose: Indicated in a victim of choking on objects that obstruct airway (pharynx) and it helps to push out the foreign body. Procedures In an adult Conscious and coughing: v May be able to dislodge the object on his own. Encourage to cough and you may give back blows . Conscious, not coughing, unable to speak or breathe, signaling for v help, typically by holding his hands around the throat. Get the person to stand up. Position yourself behind the person. Place your arms around their waist. Make a fist and place it just above the navel, thumb side in. Grab the fist with your other hand and push it inward and upward at the same time. Repeat until the object is expelled and the person can breathe or cough on their own or becomes unresponsive. Pregnant woman or obese person In a pregnant woman or an obese person, give chest thrusts instead of abdominal thrusts. Place your hands in the middle of the chest in lowert half of sternum. unresponsive after choking In case a choking adult becomes unresponsive, gently lower them to the ground and start CPR with chest compressions without checking pulse. Give 30 compressions followed by 2 breaths. Each time before giving breath, open mouth to look for the foreign body, remove it if you can see, otherwise give breaths and continue CPR. Once the foreign body is removed, check for pulse and manage as per BCLS guidelines. Remember! Alert the medical emergency system if you haven't already done. SkIll 14: RECO vERy POSITION purpose: Maintains airway patency (pushes the tongue and jaw forward) and facilitates passage of secretions or vomit out of the mouth, with the help of gravity. procedure: Kneel beside the victim on the side he is to be turned. Place the arm nearest to you at a right angle to the body with hand upwards towards the head. Place victim's another arm across his chest and tuck his hand under the side of the head, so that the back of the hand is touching the cheek. Bend the knee farthest from you to a right angle using one hand. With the other hand, hold the victim's far side shoulder. Pulling with both your hands simultaneously, roll the victim towards you. The top arm supports the head and the bottom arm will stop you rolling them too far. Keep the lower leg straight while keeping the upper leg bent. Open their airway by gently tilting head back and lifting chin, and check that nothing is blocking their airway. Heimlich maneuverLesson 4: Skills :Airway and Brea thing 37Complication: In a trauma patient, recovery position may worsen the injuries and should not be done. In the case of a spine injury, putting the victim in recovery position may lead to paralysis. SkIll 15: mEChaNICal vENTIla TION IN aN adul T IN ThE Ed Mechanical ventilation is a lifesaving skill in the Emergency Department (ED). The objectives of mechanical ventilation are primarily to maintain oxygenation, eliminate carbon dioxide and decrease the work of breathing. The need for mechanical ventilation is best made early, on clinical observation. A good rule of thumb is if the practitioner is thinking that mechanical ventilation is needed, then it is needed. Indications Clinical criteria Apnea or hypopnea (RR<8/min), respiratory distress with altered mentation, clinically increased work of breathing, obtundation and need for airway protection, controlled hyperventilation (in head injury) and severe circulatory shock. laboratory criteria ABG values of PaO2<50 mmHg, PaCO2>50 mmHg, pH <7.32. 25 cm H2O and FEV1 <10 ml/kg. Setting up of ventilator Tidal volume Tidal V olume (TV) of 5-8 ml/kg of ideal body weight is started and adjusted to keep plateau pressure less than 35 cm H 2O. 1 32 4Figure 4.8: Recovery PositionProvider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 38 Lesson 4: Skills :Airway and Brea thingRespiratory rate Set a Respiratory Rate (RR) of 8-12 breaths per minute. Based on an assessment of the patient and response to initial settings, respiratory rate may be decreased to as low as 5-6 breaths per minute in asthmatic patients, COPD (Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease), and ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome), when using a permissive hypercapnic technique. Supplemental oxygen therapy Initial setting is kept at 100% oxygen. Once monitoring is initiated and the patient is stabilized, the lowest FiO 2 that produces an arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 94% -98% and a PaO2 greater than mmHg is adjusted. Inspiration/expiration ratio The normal inspiration/expiration (I/E) ratio to start with is 1:2. This is reduced to 1:4 or 1:5 in the presence of obstructive airway disease in order to avoid air-trapping (breath stacking) and auto-PEEP or intrinsic PEEP (iPEEP). Inspiratory flow rates Inspiratory flow rates are set at 60 litre/min. Inspiratory flow rates are a function of the TV , I/E ratio, and RR and may be controlled internally by the ventilator. Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) Use of PEEP of 3-5 cm H2O is common to prevent a decrease in functional residual capacity in normal lungs. The reasoning for increasing levels of PEEP in critically ill patients is to provide acceptable oxygenation and to reduce the FiO 2 to nontoxic levels (FiO2 < 0.5). The level of PEEP must be balanced such that excessive intrathoracic pressure (with a resultant decrease in venous return, hemodynamic instability and risk of barotrauma) does not occur. PEEP reduces the incidence of ventilator-induced lung injury and decreases venous return to the right side of the heart by increasing intrathoracic pressure. mode of ventilation in Ed The choice of mode of ventilation in the emergency setting would depend on the patient assessment with regards to the need of ventilation and respiratory status. Synchronous Intermittent mandatory ventilation Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (SIMV) is a versatile mode that can be used for initial settings. The ventilator delivers pre-set breaths in coordination with the respiratory effort of the patient. Spontaneous breathing is allowed between breaths. Synchronization between pre-set mandatory breaths and the patient's spontaneous breaths attempts to limit barotrauma. One disadvantage of SIMV is increased work of breathing, though this may be mitigated by adding pressure support on top of spontaneous breaths. assist Control (a/C) Assist Control (A/C) mode is a good choice in apnoeic, paralyzed intubated patient with normal lungs and is a full support mode in that the ventilator performs most, if not all, of the work of breathing. Full support reduces oxygen consumption and CO 2 production of the respiratory muscles. Pressure Support ventilation (PSv) Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV) is a good initial choice in a patient with the respiratory effort with moderate respiratory failure. For the spontaneously breathing patient, Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV) has been advocated to limit barotrauma and to decrease the work of breathing. Pressure support differs from A/C and SIMV in that a level of support pressure is set to assist every spontaneous effort. Airway pressure support is maintained until the patient's inspiratory flow falls below a certain cut off (e.g., 25% of peak flow). The patient determines the tidal volume, respiratory rate, and flow rate. With some ventilators, there is the ability to set a back-up SIMV rate should spontaneous respirations cease.Lesson 4: Skills :Airway and Brea thing 39PSV is frequently the mode of choice in patients whose respiratory failure is not severe and who have an adequate respiratory drive. It can result in improved patient comfort, reduced cardiovascular effects, reduced risk of barotrauma, and improved distribution of gas. monitoring during ventilatory Support Cardiac monitoring, blood pressure, and pulse oximetry (Sao2) must be monitored. Arterial Blood gas (ABg) measurement is frequently obtained 10-15 minutes after the institution of mechanical ventilation. End-tidal Co2 is breath to breath measurement and is the indicator of ventilation and acid base status. It is also helpful in detection of a tube blockade or ventilator disconnection. peak inspiratory and plateau pressures should be assessed frequently. In general, however, parameters may be altered to limit pressures to less than 35 cm H 2O. Expiratory volume is checked initially and periodically to ensure that the set tidal volume is delivered. Any indication of an air leak must prompt a search for under inflated tube cuffs, open tubing ports or worsening pneumothorax. In patients with airway obstruction, monitor auto-PEEP. adverse Consequences of mechanical ventilation Pulmonary effects Barotrauma and volutrauma may result in pulmonary interstitial emphysema, pneumomediastinum, v pneumoperitoneum, pneumothorax, and/or tension pneumothora x. High peak inflation pressures (>40 cm H2O) are associated with an increased incidence of barotrauma. High-inspired concentrations of oxygen (fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO v2] >0.5) result in the free- radical formation and secondary cellular damage. These same high concentrations of oxygen can lead to alveolar nitrogen washout and secondary absorption atelectasis. V AP (Ventilator Associated Pneumonia): ED physician has a responsibility to implement measures to v reduce the risk of V AP in the ED. These interventions are aimed at reducing the risk of aspiration and decreasing bacterial colonization by placing the patient in a semi-upright position, with the head of the bed elevated 30-45 o, in order to reduce the risk of aspiration, early placement of a nasogastric tube and oral care. Lastly, an endotracheal cuff pressures should be monitored initially after intubation and every 4 hours thereafter, with goal pressures of 20-30 cm H2O. Cardiovascular effects Increased intrathoracic pressures associated with mechanical ventilation result in a decrease in cardiac output due to decreased venous return to the right heart, right ventricular dysfunction, and altered left ventricular distensability. The decrease in cardiac output from the reduction of right ventricular preload is more pronounced in the hypovolemic patient and in those with a low ejection fraction. Renal, hepatic, and gastrointestinal effects Positive-pressure ventilation is responsible for an overall decline in renal function with decreased urine volume and sodium excretion. Hepatic function is adversely affected by decreased cardiac output, increased hepatic vascular resistance, and elevated bile duct pressure. venous Thrombo Embolism (vTE) Mechanically ventilated patients are at high risk for development of VTE. In patients without contraindications, unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin should be considered for VTE otherwise pneumatic compression devices should be used.Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 40 Lesson 5: Circula tion: Shock, Chest pain histamine receptor antagonist should be considered in patients who are at high risk of gastrointestinal hemorrhage. These high-risk patients have been identified as those with coagulopathy, history of gastrointestinal bleeding, history of gastritis or peptic ulcer, or mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours. ventilator Troubleshooting The commonly encountered complication in the ED includes hypoxia, hypotension, high-pressure v alarms, and low exhaled-volume alarms. Intubated patients who develop hemodynamic instability with respiratory compromise should v immediately be disconnected from the ventilator and manually ventilated with 100% oxygen.One of the first diagnoses that should be considered in any hemodynamically unstable patient v undergoing positive-pressure ventilation is tension pneumothorax. This is a clinical diagnosis and should be detected and treated with needle decompression prior to obtaining a chest radiograph. In the case of endotracheal tube obstruction, attempts to manually ventilate the patient is met with a v significant amount of resistance and high-pressure alarms may sound. Endotracheal tube obstruction may be caused by extrinsic compression, tube plugs with mucus, blood, or foreign bodies, tube kinks or tube biting. Tube suctioning and adequate patient sedation is recommended after other causes of obstruction are ruled out. High peak pressure with normal plateau pressures indicates increased resistance to flow, such as v endotracheal tube obstruction or bronchospasm. An increase in both peak and plateau pressures suggest decreased lung compliance, which may be v seen in disease states such as pneumonia, ARDS, pulmonary edema, and abdominal distension.Low exhaled volume alarms are triggered by air leaks. These are most frequently secondary to v ventilatory tube disconnection from the patient's tracheal tube, but will also occur in the event of balloon deflation or tracheal tube dislodgement. The causes of high airway pressures and low exhaled volumes described above can result in hypoxia v if they cause hypoventilation. bIblIOgRaPhy 1.

INTROduCTION TO ShOCk Shock results from inadequate tissue perfusion that creates an imbalance between oxygen delivery and requirement for oxygen, leading to cellular dysfunction and breakdown in organ function. Due to inadequate tissue perfusion, the body shifts from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism, leading to intracellular accumulation of lactic acid and acidosis. If tissue hypoperfusion is left uncorrected, cellular dysfunction and organ failure occur. This may ultimately lead to patient death. Initially, the body increases the heart rate to maintain cardiac output to compensate for inadequate perfusion. Progressive vasoconstriction of cutaneous, muscle and visceral circulation occurs to preserve blood flow to the vital organs. Increase in peripheral vascular resistance with the resultant increase in diastolic blood pressure and a reduction in pulse pressure occurs due to release of endogenous catecholamines. The stages of shock Compensated (early) shock: This is the initial stage of shock when the compensatory mechanisms of the body are sufficient to overcome the loss. Patients may have normal mental status or are anxious. There is tachycardia, low volume and rapid pulse, tachypnoea, skin is pale, cold and clammy, capillary refill time is delayed, pulse pressure is narrow and systolic blood pressure is normal.Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 42 Lesson 5: Circula tion: Shock, Chest pain and Peri-Arrest ArrhythmiasDecompensated shock: In this stage, the condition of a patient deteriorates as the body is unable to compensate for the ongoing loss. The signs and symptoms are more pronounced. Fall in blood pressure is a characteristic sign of this stage. Other signs are altered mental status, tachycardia, low volume and rapid pulse, tachypnoea, reduced body temperature, pale, cold and clammy skin and delayed capillary refill. If untreated or inadequately treated, the patient may progress into a stage of irreversible shock. Irreversible shock: In this stage of shock, cell and organ damage has already occurred and recovery is unlikely, despite aggressive resuscitation. Patient may become unresponsive, cold, has decreased heart rate, decreased respiratory rate and profound hypotension. Figure 5.1: Stages of shock Compensated/Early Shock- Body can compensate.Mental status isnormal/anxious, tachycardia,low volume and skin is cooland is unable to compensate.Fall in blood pr essur e is a characteristic sign. Havealtered mental status. Signsand symptoms become morepronounced.Irreversible Shock- cell and organ damage has occurred &recovery is unlikely . Patient may become unresponsive, cold, decreased heart rate &respiratory rate and profoundhypotension. Classification of shock hypovolaemic shock: v There is inadequate circulating volume as in haemorrhage, severe diarrhoea, vomiting, excessive sweating and severe burns. Cardiogenic shock: v Occurs due to inadequate cardiac pump function (acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias).obstructive shock: v Occurs due to a decrease in venous return or cardiac compliance due to increased left ventricular outflow obstruction or marked preload decrease (tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade and pulmonary embolism). Distributive shock: v Marked systemic vasodilation leads to relative intravascular volume depletion, as in sepsis (septic shock), anaphylaxis (anaphylactic shock) and spinal cord injury (neurogenic shock).The clinical manifestations of shock include sympathetic neuroendocrine responses to hypoperfusion v as well as the breakdown in organ function induced by severe cellular dysfunction. Criteria for diagnosis of shock At least four of the following criteria should be met irrespective of etiology for diagnosis of shock: 1. Acute altered mental status or ill appearance. 2.

Listen for chest and heart by auscultation with a stethoscope (gallop/third heart sound of failure/significant murmur). Feel for the temperature of limbs (cool or warm), pulse rate and volume, capillary refill time (normal < 2 sec) and measure blood pressure.

For unresponsive patients who are in cardiac arrest, immediately start CPR as per the guidelines for management of cardiac arrest (refer to skill: Basic Cardiopulmonary Life Support and Comprehensive Cardiopulmonary Life Support). If perfusion status of the patient is inadequate or compromised, identify and treat according to the etiology. A clinical history can suggest the mechanism or type of shock, which is then managed accordingly (refer to Algorithm- 5.2). aSSESSmENT aNd maNagEmENT OF dIFFERENT TyPES OF ShOCk hypovolaemic shock Hypovolaemic shock results from significant fluid or blood loss. History suggests the cause and type of loss. It is of two types: 1. Non-haemorrhagic (diarrhoea, vomiting, sweating, burns). 2. Haemorrhagic (loss of blood volume). Assessment: Clinical signs and symptoms include anxiety, dizziness, altered mental state, thirst, pale, cool and clammy skin, delayed capillary refill, tachypnoea, tachycardia, a weak thready and rapid pulse, hypotension and decreased urine output. Action: If the cause of hypovolaemia is non-haemorrhagic (refer to algorithm- 5.3): Maintain airway and breathing, give oxygen and keep the patient warm. v Have the person lie flat with feet elevated if there is no contraindication. vProvider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 44 Lesson 5: Circula tion: Shock, Chest pain and Peri-Arrest ArrhythmiasSecure two wide bore (largest size possible cannula) intravenous lines. v Give warm crystalloid fluids (RL/NS 1 litre boluses in adults, 20 ml per kg in children). v Identify and treat the cause. v Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance. v Consider differential diagnosis. v Always assess and reassess therapeutic response. v Algorithm 5.2: Approach to a patient with undifferentiated shock Shock diagnostic criteria (At least four): Acute altered mental status or ill appearance Heart rate > 100/min Hypotension for more than 30 continuous minutes RR >20/min or PaCO2 <32 mm Hg Urine output less than decit < -4 mEq/L or History of trauma History of vomiting, diarrhoea, GI bleeding Fever Hypothermia Chest pain ECG- ischemia Urticaria, Skin Cardiogenic shock- ACS Anaphylactic shockCrystalloid and blood component transfusion Needle decompression of pneumothorax followed by chest drain, Pericardiocentesis Crystalloid infusion Vasopressors Fluid resuscitation Fluid re suscitation Vasopressors- prefer Norepinephrine AntimicrobialsIdentify focus and Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)Lesson 5: Shock, Chest pain and Peri-Arrest Arrhythmias to a patient with Hypovolaemic shock Haemorrhagic Non-HaemorrhagicHypovolaemic Shock Early control of haemorrhage Activate Massive T ransfusion Protocol (MTP) Restore circulating volumeHypotensive resuscitationAvoid vasopressors Adequate and oxygenMake patient lie flat withlegs elevated if no contra-indication Secure 2 wide bore intravenous access and collect blod samplesGive warm fluid bolus(RL/NS 1 L) Keep the patient warmCatheterize bladderCall for Expert help at theearliest Identify and treat Re-assess Abbreviations: Airway Ringer Lactate (RL); (NS) haemorrhagic shock Penetrating and blunt trauma, gastrointestinal bleeding, or obstetric bleeding may cause haemorrhagic shock. External haemorrhage is immediately recognizable, as there is visible blood loss. However, internal haemorrhage is not easily identifiable. Signs that are suggestive of internal haemorrhage include abdominal pain and swelling, blood in the stool (melena), blood in the urine, vaginal bleeding (heavy), vomiting blood, a sign of injury on the external surface like a bruise, etc. Early control of haemorrhage is essential to limit consumptive coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia and decrease the need to transfuse blood and blood products. Resuscitation strategy should be to maintain organ perfusion and at the same time minimize the risk of rebleeding. Normalization of blood pressure can increase haemorrhage. Hence, lower-than-normal blood pressure is usually accepted and is termed \"hypotensive resuscitation\" or \"permissive hypotension.\" The blood pressure goal is to maintain a systolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg but if patient has a head injury, then one must maintain systolic blood pressure greater than 100 mmHg. Caution: Hypotensive resuscitation strategy is not advisable in patients with a myocardial disease, cerebral ischemia, or traumatic brain injury. The approximate amount of blood loss that may have occurred in a patient can be estimated based on his clinical presentation (refer to figure 5.2).Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 46 Lesson 5: Circula tion: Shock, Chest pain and Peri-Arrest ArrhythmiasFigure 5.2: Approximate blood loss based on clinical presentation (in a 70 kg adult) SHOCKClass 1: Blood loss up to 750 ml (15% blood volume) Initial Fluid replacement - crystalloidsClass 2: Blood loss 750-1500 ml (15-30% blood volume)Initial Fluid replacement - crystalloids Class 3: Blood loss 1500-2000 ml (30-40% blood volume) Initial Fluid replacement - crystalloids + bloodClass 4: Blood loss >2000 ml (>40% blood volume) Initial Fluid replacement - crystalloids + blood1 2 4 3PR 100-120/min Systolic BP is normalPulse pressure decreasedRespiratory rate to 30/min Urine output 20-30ml/hrMildly anxiousPR<100/minSystolic BP is normalPulse pressure is normal or increased Respiratory rate 14 to 20/min Urine output >30ml/hrSlightly anxious PR>140/min Systolic BP is negligibleConfused, lethargicPR 120-140/minSystolic BP is decreasedPulse pressure decreasedRespiratory rate 30 to 40/min Urine output 5-15 ml/hrAnxious, confused massive Transfusion Protocol (mTP) Profusely bleeding patient, in class 3 or class 4 shock, with an expected blood loss greater than 30% blood volume, may require a massive blood transfusion. In these cases, Massive Transfusion Protocol (MTP) should be activated by the treating health care worker and steps should be taken for early definitive control of haemorrhage. To ensure rapid and timely availability of blood and blood components, the blood bank is alerted. Early administration of packed red cells, plasma, and platelets, and minimizing aggressive crystalloid administration in these patients may result in improved survival. Action: If the cause of hypovolemia is haemorrhage (refer to algorithm 5.3) Maintain airway and breathing, give oxygen and keep the patient warm. v Have the person lie flat with feet elevated, if not contraindicated. v Secure two wide bore (16G/18G) intravenous lines and give warm crystalloid fluids, RL/NS 1 litre v boluses or 20 ml/kg body weight and assess the response. Maintain intravascular volume through crystalloid fluids and blood transfusion. Blood and blood products must be infused at the earliest possible in a bleeding patient in transient or nonresponder patient. Activate MTP if indicated. Resuscitation with fluids and blood is not a substitute for control of continued blood loss. v Identify the source of bleeding which could be an external or internal bleed. Aim towards early v control of haemorrhage. The bleeding from an external source is best managed by direct pressure to the site, some wounds such as scalp wounds may require suturing. Splinting of long bone fractures and use of a pelvic binder in a pelvic fracture is useful in reducing further blood loss. The source of internal blood loss can be due to injury to thorax, abdomen including retroperitoneum, pelvis and long bones. Early surgical intervention for rapid and definitive control of internal bleeding may be required after v surgical consultation. An emergency surgical intervention will be required in nonresponders and transient responders to fluid resuscitation.Lesson 5: Circula tion: Shock, Chest pain and lethal triad of coagulopathy, hypothermia and acidosis for a better outcome of the patients by v maintaining oxygenation, perfusion and body temperature. Bicarbonate is usually not indicated. Its administration causes a shift in the oxygen-haemoglobin v dissociation curve to the left, this impairs tissue unloading of haemoglobin-bound oxygen, and may worsen intracellular acidosis. However, bicarbonate may be given in severe metabolic acidosis (pH <7.1). Adopt hypotensive resuscitation strategy till control haemorrhage, unless contraindicated as in v severe anaemia, myocardial disease, cerebral ischemia or traumatic brain injury.Check for history of drug intake of antiplatelet and anticoagulant. v Vasopressors may worsen tissue perfusion in hemorrhagic shock and must be avoided. Vasopressors v may be given in a situation where volume infusion is contraindicated as in heart disease. Colloids have no proven consistent benefit. Hetastarch may be used as a part of hypotensive v resuscitation strategy. It should not be given more than 1000 ml. Theoretically, giving 1000 ml of hetastarch is equivalent to 3 L of isotonic crystalloid fluid. Check response to initial resuscitation by assessing vital signs, capillary refill, CVP, urine output, v temperature and level of consciousness. anaphylactic shock Anaphylactic shock is one of the causes of distributive shock. It is characterized by hypotension due to excessive vasodilation and capillary leakage, due to the massive release of chemical mediators from mast cells and basophils following anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is the most severe life-threatening form of an allergic reaction, often involving respiratory or cardiovascular compromise. The diagnosis of anaphylaxis is clinical. A history of exposure to an allergen helps in the diagnosis. Anaphylaxis should be considered when there is involvement of any two or more body systems such as cutaneous, respiratory, gastrointestinal or cardiovascular system, with or without hypotension or airway compromise. Clinical Criteria for anaphylaxis 1. Urticaria, generalized itching or flushing, or edema of lips, tongue, uvula, or skin developing over minutes to hours, associated with at least one of the following: Respiratory distress or hypoxia. v Hypotension or cardiovascular collapse. v Associated symptoms of organ dysfunction (such as hypotonia, syncope, incontinence). v 2. Two or more of the following that occur minutes to hours after allergen exposure: Skin and/or mucosal signs or symptoms (hives, itching, flushing, swollen lips, tongue, uvula). v Respiratory compromise. v Hypotension or associated symptoms. v Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, cramps, vomiting). v 3. There is hypotension following exposure to a known pain, dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest. Neurologic: seizure. v Pruritus, angioedema, tearing, redness.Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 48 Lesson 5: Circula tion: Shock, Chest pain and Peri-Arrest Arrhythmiasaction: (See algorithm 5.4) Remove or discontinue exposure to the allergen if possible and call for help/assistance. v Make the patient lie down and elevate his legs. If patient has breathing difficulty, may allow them to v sit, to aid breathing but this may trigger hypotension so need to monitor very closely. Give high flow oxygen with a face mask. v In severe anaphylaxis, securing the airway is the first priority. If patient is in respiratory distress due v to angioedema, then intubate early, as any delay may result in complete airway obstruction following a progression of angioedema. Without delay give intramuscular injection of epinephrine/adrenaline (1:1000) as 0.01 mg/kg up to v a maximum 0.5 mg per dose in an adult, into anterolateral aspect of mid-thigh). May repeat dose if required, in 5-10 minutes. Secure two wide bore (16G/18G) intravenous lines and administer warm crystalloid fluids (RL/NS v 20 ml/kg boluses). First-Line Treatment: Initiate emergency treatment with the ABCs (airway, breathing, circulation) of resuscitation. The first-line therapy for anaphylaxis includes oxygen, epinephrine and IV fluids. These have immediate effect during the acute stage of anaphylaxis. The treatment of choice for anaphylaxis is epinephrine In patients without signs of cardiovascular compromise or collapse, administer an intramuscular v injection of epinephrine/adrenaline (1:1000) as 0.01 mg/kg up to maximum 0.5 mg per dose in an adult, into the anterolateral aspect of mid-thigh). May repeat the dose if required in 5-10 minutes. In patients who are refractory to treatment despite repeated doses of IM adrenaline or those patients v who have signs of cardiovascular compromise or collapse, start adrenaline infusion at 1\u00b5g/min and titrate to desired effect. To prepare adrenaline infusion, add 1 mg (1 ml of 1:1000 dilution) adrenaline in 1000 mL NS and start to infuse at 1 ml/min; titrate dose as needed). Adrenaline IV bolus doses should not be given as they increase the risk of cardiac ischaemia or arrythmias. In case the patient has a cardiac arrest, then follow cardiac arrest protocol and in addition give v aggressive fluid resuscitation. In patients with upper airway obstruction, give nebulized epinephrine 5 ml (5 ampoules of 1 in 1000 v adrenaline). These patients require early intubation. Second-Line Treatment: Drugs such as corticosteroids, antihistamines, glucagon are used to treat refractory anaphylaxis, associated with complications, and to prevent recurrences. Corticosteroids: v Methylprednisolone, 80-125 mg IV (2 mg/kg in children up to 125 mg), or hydrocortisone, 250-500 mg IV (5 to 10 mg/kg in children; up to 500 mg), Antihistamines: histamine-1 blocker, such as diphenhydramine, 25-50 mg IV slow infusion or IM injection, histamine-2 blockers such as ranitidine 50 milligrams IV over 5 min. After the initial IV dose of steroids and antihistamines, the patient may be switched to oral medication. glucagon: v If patients on -blockers have hypotension that is refractory to fluids and epinephrine, in them glucagon 1 mg IV every 5 minutes may be administered, until hypotension resolves, followed by an infusion of 5-15 \u00b5g/min. Bronchodilators: v If wheezing persists, salbutamol 8-10 puffs of 100 \u00b5g, using a spacer or nebulization with 5 mg salbutamol using a nebulizer should be given. Nebulized ipratropium bromide (500 \u00b5g) may also be given in severe acute bronchospasm. Magnesium sulfate 2 gm IV over 20 min may also be given.Lesson 5: Circula tion: Shock, Chest pain and Peri-Arrest Arrhythmias the H/o exposure to measur es: Remove/discontinue exposure to allergenCall for helpMake patient lie and elevate legsGive adrenaline IM or IV infusion as indicatedGive omise/ Absent Start adrenaline infusion (start with 1 \u00b5gm/min; titrate to ef fect)Adrenaline IM 1:1000 as 0.01 mg/kg up to maximum 0.5 mg per dose in adultsRepeat every 5 to 10 minutes If refractory to tr eatment: Give adrenaline infusion (start with 1 \u00b5gm/min; titrate to ef fect) Start second line treatment with drugs such as CorticosteroidsH1 & H2 blockersA Feeling of throat tightening, breathing dif , uvula oedema,Stridor , respiratory distress, Give secure airway by early tracheal intubation (NS); Cardiovascular System (CVS); Intra Muscular (IM) Septic shock Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection.

Extensive myocardial infarction that depresses myocardial contractility is the most common cause of cardiogenic shock. Other causes include myocarditis, myocardial contusion, cardiomyopathy, drug toxicity (e.g., -blocker overdose, calcium channel blocker overdose) and unstable dysrhythmia etc. The risk factors for cardiogenic shock are elderly person, female, acute or prior ischemic event associated with impaired ejection fraction, extensive infarct, proximal left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion, anterior multi-vessel disease; prior medical history of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure or diabetes. assessment history: Patients may give a history of breathlessness, chest pain, pre-existing valvular heart disease, or substance abuse. Signs and symptoms: Chest pain, respiratory distress, rapid shallow respiration, altered mental status, decreased urine output, change in skin colour (ashen or cyanotic), cool clammy skin, tachycardia, hypotension, decreased oxygen saturation, neck veins distended, auscultation of heart and lungs for crepitations in lungs, cardiac murmurs and gallop. Haemodynamic criteria shock include: Sustained Elevated pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (>18 mmHg). v action (management) Airway & BreathingMaintain patient's airway and breathing.

ChEST PaIN Core Concepts A variety of conditions can lead to chest pain. The main aim of the initial assessment is a rapid v identification of life-threatening causes and their immediate management. Obtain an ECG in all patients with chest pain and triage the patients accordingly. However, a v completely normal ECG does not exclude angina or acute myocardial infarction.Lesson 5: Circula tion: Shock, Chest pain and Peri-Arrest Arrhythmias 55assessment & management of patients with acute chest pain Acute chest pain in a patient can not only be because of cardiac origin, but there are other causes as well. Causes of acute chest pain Cardiac 1. Acute myocardial infarction 2. Unstable angina/stable angina Acute pancreatitis 3. Esophageal reflux/spasm 4. Esophageal rupture Musculoskeletala. Trauma b. Inflammation assessment history: Important points in the history include type, duration, location, severity and radiation of pain, precipitating and relieving factors. Type (quality) of pain Patients with myocardial ischemia often describe the pain as squeezing, tightness, pressure, constriction, v strangling, burning, heartburn, fullness in the chest, a band-like sensation, or lump in the throat. In some cases, the patient cannot describe the nature of the discomfort, but places his or her fist in the v centre of the chest. Location of pain Ischemic pain is a diffuse discomfort that may be difficult to localize. v Pain that localizes to a small area on the chest is more likely to be of the chest wall or pleural origin v rather than visceral. Duration of pain The pain of myocardial ischemia generally lasts for a few minutes to hours; it may be more prolonged in the setting of a myocardial infarction. Radiation of pain:Ischemic pain may radiate to the upper extremity, shoulder, throat, lower jaw or teeth.onset of pain The onset of ischemic pain is usually gradual with an increasing intensity over time. v Chest pain awakening the patient from sleep is a sign of ischemic pain. v Pain associated with pneumothorax, aortic dissection or acute pulmonary embolism typically has an v abrupt onset with the greatest intensity of pain at the beginning. Severity of pain Severity of pain is not an indicator of the seriousness of the underlying cause. vProvider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 56 Lesson 5: Circula tion: Shock, Chest pain and Peri-Arrest Arrhythmiasprecipitating factors Chest discomfort provoked by exertion is a classic symptom of angina, although oesophageal pain can v present similarly. Other factors that may provoke ischemic pain include cold, emotional stress, meals, or sexual intercourse. Pain that occurs with eating or is made worse while swallowing is suggestive of the upper gastrointestinal v disease. Body position or movement, as well as deep breathing, may exacerbate chest pain of musculoskeletal v origin. Pleuritic chest pain is worsened by respiration. However, besides a benign cause like viral pleuritis, v serious causes like pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax and bacterial pneumonia can also produce pleuritic chest pain. Relieving factors Chest pain that abates with cessation of activity strongly suggests an ischemic pain. v Pain that responds to sublingual nitrates may be of either esophageal or cardiac etiology. v Pain that is reliably and repeatedly reduced by antacids or food is likely to be of gastroesophageal origin. v The pain of pericarditis typically improves when the patient sits up and leans forward. v Associated symptoms Associated symptoms such as sweating, nausea, vomiting, fainting, breathlessness and palpitations v are suggestive of an ischemic event. Risk factors Hypertension, diabetes, smoking, cocaine abuse and positive family history. v Risk factors for pulmonary thromboembolism include the use of contraceptive pills, injury to lower v limbs, immobility and malignancies. past history A history of similar pain in the past, or a known illness, especially coronary artery disease, is a crucial part of the history. Examination Monitor vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, respiration, oxygen saturation) of the patient. Check blood v pressure in both arms; a significant difference in blood pressure between the two arms suggests the presence of aortic dissection. Note presence of sweating, cyanosis, use of accessory muscles. v Examine chest wall for evidence of injury, crepitus or point tenderness. v Observe symmetry of thoracic movements and equality of breath sounds on both sides of the chest. v Unilateral splinting of the chest wall is common in pleuritic chest pain or trauma. Look for dullness to percussion, crepitation, rhonchi, bronchial breath sounds and pleural rub. Examine cardiovascular system including jugular venous pressure. Perform cardiac auscultation, v both in a sitting and supine position, to establish the presence of a pericardial rub or signs of acute aortic insufficiency which may occur in aortic dissection. Ischemia may result in a mitral insufficiency murmur, S 4 or S3. Examine extremities to exclude deep vein thrombosis (swelling, Homan's sign i.e., pain in the calf v muscle on dorsiflexion of the foot). Investigations Electrocardiogram: v Obtain 12 lead ECG in all patients with chest pain. However, a completely normal ECG does not exclude angina or acute myocardial infarction.Lesson 5: 57Chest radiograph: v A chest radiograph is helpful to diagnose pneumonia or pneumothorax. It may also show mediastinal widening (in aortic dissection) and wedge-shaped, pleural-based lesions (in pulmonary embolism). Serum markers for cardiac ischemia: v If the initial assessment indicates a possibility of myocardial infarction but ECG is not diagnostic, serial cardiac enzymes are useful to identify acute cardiac ischemic events. These enzymes include MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase (CK-MB) and cardiac troponins (troponin I or troponin T). other investigations: v In some patients, certain other tests may be required to diagnose the cause of the chest pain. If diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is suspected, spiral CT chest with pulmonary angiography is useful. general management ABC of resuscitation must be the initial part of the management of such patients. v Administer oxygen and target SpO v2> 94%. Attach a cardiac monitor and secure intravenous line. v If the patient is in shock, administer fluids cautiously with a constant watch to look for development v of left ventricle failure during infusion. Get an ECG and monitor heart rate, rhythm and blood pressure. v Prepare for a defibrillator and emergency resuscitation. v Obtain focused history: v Uncomfortable pressure, fullness, squeezing or pain in the center of the chest. \u0090 Pain lasting for several minutes 2-5 min, less than 20 min duration. \u0090 Chest discomfort spreading to shoulders, neck, one or both arms or jaw. \u0090 Chest discomfort spreading into the back or between the shoulders. \u0090 Relation to stress/physical work. \u0090 Autonomic symptoms are usually present. \u0090 Associated features: v Lightheadedness, dizziness, fainting, sweating. \u0090 Nausea or vomiting. \u0090 Unexplained sudden shortness of breath, with or without chest discomfort. \u0090 Associated Risk factors: v Older age, male sex. \u0090 Positive family history of CAD. \u0090 Diabetes mellitus \u0090 tenderness \u0090 No chest pain/symptoms \u0090 Risk factors for developing atypical pain: v Diabetes, females, elderly, dementia, no prior history of MI. \u0090Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 58 Lesson 5: Circula tion: Shock, Chest pain and Peri-Arrest ArrhythmiasDifferential diagnosis of Suspected of Cardiac Origin Drugs Aspirin: v Dose: 160-325 mg, Chewed for better absorption. Avoid giving Aspirin in patients with evidence of Recent GI Bleed or if the patient had already taken Aspirin. Nitrate: v Give 1-2 tablets (5-10 mg) of Isosorbide dinitrate by sublingual route.

STEmI (ST Elevation mI) or new lbbb Defined as sustained chest pain suggestive of MI with Acute ST elevation. Assess on the basis of ECg: 1 mm of ST elevation in 2 contiguous leads is required to diagnose STEMI, however, there are two major exceptions:1. Anterior STEMI requires 2 mm of ST elevation in V 2 and V3 in men > 40 years old according to the ACC/AHA definition. A total of 2.5 mm is required in men < 40 years old and only 1.5 mm required in women. 2. Posterior STEMI frequently has ST depression in V1-V3 instead of elevation since the vectors are completely reversed. If a posterior ECG were obtained, ST elevation will be seen in V7-V9, although sometimes subtle. Since these posterior changes occur from coronary thrombosis and urgent treatment is needed, it is classified as a STEMI. 3.

Assess on the basis of ECG and biomarkers:The ECG tracing can have multiple abnormalities, but, by definition, there is no ST segment elevation. The most common finding is ST segment depression. This ST segment depression is horizontal or down-sloping in shape. The T waves may be inverted, usually symmetrically. Common observations on ECG may be seen as ST Depression of >0.5 mm or Transient ST elevation of > 0.5 mm for < 20 min: ECG changes can be dynamic and the findings normal initially, so estimation of cardiac enzymes and v ECG 6-8 hourly is required to completely exclude unstable angina and Non-STEMI. Also, cardiac enzymes (troponin and creatine kinase) require 3-4 hours after the injury before showing significant elevation. Note: Unstable angina and non-STEMI can both occur, even with a normal ECG. The main distinguishing feature between the two: During Non-STEMI, there will be elevation of the cardiac enzymes, indicative of myocardial necrosis. During unstable angina, there is no or only very minimal elevation of cardiac enzymes.

PERI-aRREST aRRhyThmIaS Core Concepts Peri-arrest arrhythmias include rhythm disturbances (bradycardia or tachycardia rhythms) that v immediately precede a cardiac arrest or follow a successful resuscitation. If not treated, these rhythms may rapidly progress to arrest rhythms. Triage the patients based on the presence of danger signs and manage accordingly. v Recognize the rhythm and follow the protocol for management. v There are 2 main categories of abnormal peri arrest rhythms: Tachycardia (HR >100/min) and Bradycardia (HR < 60/min). management of a patient with Peri-arrest arrhythmia (algorithm 5.6) Follow The NELS ABC approach for assessment and management: Airway: v Ensure the airway is patent. If not, maintain the patency.Lesson 5: Circula tion: Shock, Chest pain and Peri-Arrest Arrhythmias 63Breathing: v Assess the breathing. If inadequate, support the breathing. Give supplemental oxygen if hypoxaemic (SpO2< 94%). Circulation: v Attach monitors. Look for ECG (Tachycardia/Bradycardia), BP and Oxygen saturation. Secure IV Access. Look for reversible causes of tachycardia/bradycardia like fever, sepsis. If there is a presence of reversible cause, treat the cause. Look for Danger Signs and SymptomsWhile assessing the patient, it is important to identify those who have the danger signs such as: Shock (pallor, cold clammy skin, delayed capillary refill time). v Acutely altered mental status. v Chest Pain. v Hypotension. v Acute heart failure. v If the patient has these danger signs, it implies that he is unstable and requires urgent intervention.

First degree is the least v severe, and third degree is the most severe. First-degree heart block In first-degree heart block, there is a prolongation of PR interval (>0.2 sec), but the PR interval does not vary and is constant. First-degree heart block may not cause any symptoms or require treatment. First-degree heart block Second-degree heart block In this type of heart block, some electrical signals from the atria do not reach the ventricles. On ECG, v every P wave is not followed by a QRS complex, as it normally would.Lesson 5: Circula tion: Shock, Chest pain and Peri-Arrest Arrhythmias 67Second-degree heart block is of two types: Mobitz type I and Mobitz type II. v Mobitz Type I In this type (Wenckebach's block), on the ECG, there is a progressive lengthening of PR interval until v a P wave is not followed by a QRS complex. Mobitz type I Mobitz Type II In second-degree Mobitz type II heart block, the pattern is less regular than in Mobitz type I. Some v signals move between the atria and ventricles normally, while others are blocked. On an ECG, PR interval is constant and some P waves are not followed by QRS complex. Ventricular v rhythm is irregular because of some blocked impulses. Mobitz type II is less common than type I, but it's usually more severe. Some people who have type II may need pacing. Mobitz type II Third-degree heart block In this type of heart block, no electrical signals from atria reach the ventricles. This is also known as v complete heart block or complete A V block. When complete heart block occurs, some areas in the ventricles may generate electrical signals to v cause the ventricles to contract. This natural backup system is slower than the normal heart rate and is not coordinated with the contraction of the atria. On ECG, both atrial and ventricular rhythms are regular but are dissociated and independent of each v other. Complete heart block can result in sudden cardiac arrest and death. This type of heart block often requires emergency treatment. A temporary pacemaker might be used until a permanent pacemaker is implanted.

SkIll 7: b aSIC CaRdIOPulmONaR y lIFE SuPPORT (bClS) Core links in adult BCLS: To get an optimal outcome in people who suffer cardiopulmonary arrest outside the hospital, four essential core links need to be followed. These are Early recognition and activation; Early high quality CPR; Early defibrillation and Early transfer. BCLS: The BCLS approach is a simplified algorithm-based approach to be followed for a victim with cardiopulmonary arrest outside the hospital. Though the recommended algorithm of BCLS is in sequential series, when more than one trained rescuers are present, the steps may be done simultaneously. Before approaching a victim always ensure that the scene is safe both for the rescuer (You) and the victim. Take standard precautions. Next, check for responsiveness (tap on shoulders and shout). If the victim is unresponsive, activate the ambulance services (via mobile phone) and get an AED (automated external defibrillator) or tell someone to do it. To activate the ambulance services, you may dial your state/regional number. The number 108 has been proposed as the pan-India emergency contact number, and it has been accepted by many states of India. Remember to give full details, ask for AED and don't hang up till told to do so. Check for the carotid pulse and simultaneously observe the chest for breathing movements for five to ten seconds. By chanting 1001, 1002, 1003 ....... one is able to keep track of time, it takes around one second to chant a number each time. During the check of pulse and breathing, the three clinical situations that may be encountered are as follows:A. If the victim is breathing normally and has a carotid pulse, he/she should be shifted in the recovery position (if no trauma) and assessed every 2 min or earlier to determine any change in condition till medical help arrives. The victim should be shifted to the nearest medical facility at the earliest. B. If the victim is not breathing but has a carotid pulse, then normal tidal volume breaths every 5 s at the rate of 12 breaths/minute should be provided using mouth to mouth (with/without barrier device), mouth to mask or bag mask device ventilation. Each breath should be delivered over 1 s. The end point of the ventilation breath is visible chest rise. Check the carotid pulse every 2 minutes or earlier to observe any change in the condition of the victim. Wait for the medical team and shift the victim to the nearest medical facility at the earliest.

If the victim is not breathing or is gasping and there is no carotid pulse, he is in cardiopulmonary arrest and requires high-quality CPR including cycles of compression and breaths at the earliest. Start with chest compressions. Give cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths (CAB sequence: Chest compression-Airway-Breathing). CAB sequence Chest compressions: Give 30 chest compressions. (refer to the skill of chest compression) Push Hard (5-6 cm); Push Fast (120/min); Allow complete Chest Recoil and Minimize Interruptions. Airway: To open the airway, do head tilt-chin lift. but, If a cervical spine injury is suspected give jaw thrust or chin lift. Breathing: Rescue breaths can be given mouth to mouth (with/without barriers device); mouth to mask or using a bag-mask device. Two breaths to be given each over 1 second; there should be a visible chest rise. If there is more than one rescuer, then the chest compression and administration of breath can be done by two different rescuers. The rescuer roles should be interchanged every five cycles of CPR (five cycles of 30 chest compressions and 2 breaths) to prevent exhaustion and maintain effective BCLS, especially chest compression. Reassess the carotid pulse after every 5 cycles of CPR. Use AED as soon as it is available. To use AED, power on the AED and follow the voice prompts. If a shock is advised, give the shock. After shock, immediately start CPR with chest compression for 5 cycles until prompted by AED for rhythm check. If no shock advised, continue CPR till the victim starts to move or advanced life support providers take over. provide high quality BCLS to ensure an optimal outcome. The various aspects enhancing the outcome include: High quality chest compressions. v Chest compressions speed, rate and recoil: Ensure a chest compression speed of 120 compressions/ v minute to a depth of 5-6 cm. Allow complete chest recoil between compression without lifting the hands from the chest (do not lean on the victim's chest). Avoid unnecessary interruption of chest compressions. v Optimal ventilation and airway management: v Do not interrupt chest compression to secure the airway, apply ECG electrodes or defibrillator \u0090 pads/paddles.Do not hyperventilate. \u0090 End point for ventilation is a visible chest rise deliver normal tidal volume breaths. \u0090 SkIll 8: Ch EST COmPRESSIONS vVictim position: Place the victim on a firm, flat surface. vRescuer position: Rescuer to kneel by side of the victim. vhand position: Place the heel of one hand on the center of victim's chest (lower half of sternum), place heel of another hand on top of 1st hand, and interlace fingers to keep them off the chest. Arms should be straight and shoulders above the victim's chest. Push Hard (5-6 cm). v Push Fast (120/min). v Allow complete Chest recoil. v Minimize interruptions. v The rescuer should chant loudly 1, 2, 3, 4,....30 to v maintain the speed and number of chest compressions.

SuPPORT (CClS) The early identification of pre-arrest conditions and appropriate management are essential to prevent cardiac arrest in the controlled environment of a hospital. If a patient develops cardiac arrest in the hospital, an optimal outcome requires not only the basic resuscitation steps but also the incorporation of advanced steps including administration of drugs, airway management, correction of underlying a etiologies, advanced monitoring and post-resuscitation care. Core links in adult CCLS: The five essential core links in adult CCLS for optimal outcome in a patient with cardiopulmonary arrest are [Figure 6.3] Early recognition and management of pre -arrest conditions; Early recognition of arrest and activation of Code blue; Early high-quality CPR; Early defibrillation; Early comprehensive life support and post-resuscitation care. Figure 6.3: Core links in CCLS Early Recognition & Management of Pre-Arr est ConditionEarly Recognition & Activation of Code BlueEarly High Quality CPREarly DebrillationEarly Compr ehensive Life Support & Post Resuscitation Car e Adult CCLS: After ensuring scene safety, check the responsiveness of the patient. If unresponsive, activate code blue team or local team (Intensive care unit or another dedicated area). Check the carotid pulse and breathing simultaneously for 5 to 10 sec. A. If a patient has normal breathing with a definite carotid pulse, assess the patient every 2 min or more frequently for any change in vital parameters. B. If a patient has abnormal or no breathing with a definite carotid pulse, he/she is in a respiratory arrest. Open the airway and give one normal tidal volume breath (causing visible chest rise) every 5 sec. Airway adjuncts may be used. Reassess the carotid pulse every 2 min or earlier for a change in the vital parameters. Evaluate for the cause of respiratory arrest and manage accordingly. C. If a patient has abnormal or no breathing with no definite carotid pulse, he/she is in a cardiopulmonary arrest. Initiate high-quality CPR with cycles of 30 chest compressions and 2 breaths. After 5 cycles of CPR, reassess the carotid pulse and switch roles. If patient's airway is secured with an endotracheal tube, then chest compressions should be given continuously at a rate of 120 compressions/min without interruption, and 1 breath should be given every 6 s (10 breaths/min), instead of cycles of 30 chest compressions and 2 breaths. When a cardiac monitor or defibrillator is attached to the patient, cardiac rhythm is checked on the monitor instead of pulse. If the rhythm is shockable (V entricular Fibrillation [VF] and pulseless VT), defibrillation should be done at the earliest. Initial shock dose 120 J - 200 J (biphasic), subsequent shock may be same or escalated to a higher dose with a maximum of 200 J (biphasic). In the case of a monophasic defibrillator, the initial and subsequent energy for defibrillation should be 360 J. During cycles of CPR, other advanced aspects such as venous access, airway management, and drug administration should be integrated with cycles of CPR as early as possible. Simultaneously, the cause of cardiac arrest should be identified and treated accordingly. After vascular access is secured, give adrenaline (epinephrine) 1 mg diluted in 10 ml as bolus repeated every 3-5 min, irrespective of the type of heart rhythm. Drugs administered through peripheral venous access must be flushed with 20 ml of normal saline and whenever feasible, the limb should be elevated for 10-20 s after administration of the drug. Drugs should be administered during chest compression, so as to ensure their systemic distribution. Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor Circula persist, Amiodarone should be administered intravenously as a slow bolus after 5 min a second intravenous dose of amiodarone 150 mg may be administered if arrhythmia persists. Lignocaine may be considered as an alternative drug in patients with persistent arrhythmia. The underlying aetiology of the cardiorespiratory arrest needs to be assessed. The reversible causes of cardiopulmonary arrest may be remembered with the mnemonic: 'hIT ThE TARgET' (H - Hypoxia, I - Increased H Ions [Acidosis], T - Tension Pneumothorax, T - Toxins/ Poisons, H - Hypovolaemia, E - Electrolyte Imbalance [Hypo-/Hyperkalaemia], T-Tamponade Cardiac, A - Acute Coronary Syndrome, R - Raised Intracranial Pressure [Subarachnoid Haemorrhage], G - Glucose [Hypo-/hyperglycaemia], E - Embolism (Pulmonary Thrombosis), T - Temperature [Hypothermia]). Following the Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC), the patient should receive post-resuscitation care. He should be shifted to a monitored area and further definitive management of the underlying aetiology should be started. Oxygen supplementation and ventilation support should be provided based on the post-resuscitation assessment. The haemodynamic monitoring is essential, and the mean arterial pressure should be maintained >65 mmHg. Cardiac Arrest Rhythms: Cardiac arrest rhythms may be either shockable (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Ventricular fibrillation: v The rate or rhythm cannot be determined. The P waves, QRS complex or T waves are not recognizable. A pattern of sharp up and down deflections is seen. Ventricular fibrillation pulseless v Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The ventricular rate is more than 100/minute, typically 120 to 250/minute. The rhythm is regular ventricular rhythm.

A blood pressure measurement instrument such as an aneroid sphygmomanometer or an automated device with a manual inflate mode. procedure prepare the patient: v Make sure the patient is relaxed by allowing 5 minutes to relax before the first reading. The patient should sit upright with their upper arm positioned so it is level with their heart and feet flat on the floor. Remove excess clothing that might interfere with the BP cuff or constrict blood flow in the arm. Be sure you and the patient refrain from talking during the reading. Select the proper Bp cuff size: v Most measurement errors occur by using not the proper cuff size. Length of cuff: 80% of arm circumference. Cover 2/3 of the length of the arm.place the Bp cuff on the patient's arm: v Palpate/locate the brachial artery and position the BP cuff so that the artery marker points to the brachial artery. Wrap the BP cuff snugly around the arm.position the stethoscope: v On the same arm that you placed the BP cuff, palpate the arm at the ante cubical fossa (crease of the arm) to locate the strongest pulse and place the bell of the stethoscope over the brachial artery at this location. Inflate the BP cuff: v Begin pumping the cuff bulb as you listen to the pulse sound. When the BP cuff has inflated enough to stop blood flow you should hear no sounds through the stethoscope. The gauge should read 30-40 mmHg above the person's normal BP reading or 180 mmHg. If this value is unknown you can inflate the cuff to 160-180 mmHg. (If pulse sounds are heard right away, inflate to a higher pressure).Lesson 6: Skills :Main taining Circula tion 85Deflate the BP cuff: v Begin deflation. The AHA recommends that the pressure should fall at 2-3 mmHg per second, anything faster may likely result in an inaccurate measurement. Listen for the Systolic Reading: v The first occurrence of rhythmic sounds heard as blood begins to flow through the artery is the patient's systolic pressure. This may resemble a tapping noise at first.Listen for the Diastolic Reading: v Continue to listen as the BP cuff pressure drops and the sounds fade. Note the gauge reading when the rhythmic sounds stop. This will be the diastolic reading.Record Bp at least twice: v The AHA recommends taking a reading with both arms and averaging the readings. To check the pressure again for accuracy wait about five minutes between readings. Typically, blood pressure is higher in the mornings and lower in the evenings. If the blood pressure reading is a concern or masked or white coat hypertension is suspected, a 24 hours blood pressure study may be required to assess the patient's overall blood pressure profile. bIblIOgRaPhy 1.

Central nervous system stroke is defined as brain, spinal cord, or retinal cell death attributable to ischemia or bleeding based on neuropathological, neuroimaging, and/or clinical evidence of permanent injury. major Types of Stroke 1. Ischaemic Stroke is defined as brain, spinal cord, or retinal cell death attributable to ischemia based on neuropathological, neuroimaging, and/or clinical evidence of permanent injury (symptoms persisting for more than 24 hrs). Majority of ischemic strokes are due to occlusion of an artery to a specific area of the brain. Early recognition of acute ischemic stroke and initiation of IV fibrinolytic treatment, generally within 3 hours of onset of symptoms (4.5 hours in well screened patients who are at low risk for bleeding), is crucial for a favorable outcome. 2. haemorrhagic Stroke is defined as rapidly developing clinical signs of neurological dysfunction due to a focal collection of blood within brain parenchyma or ventricular system, which is not due to trauma. It occurs due to rupture of a blood vessel of the brain, leading to either Intracerebral hemorrhage or Subarachnoid hemorrhage. Fibrinolytic therapy is contraindicated in haemorrhagic stroke and anticoagulants and antiplatelets are to be avoided. Early CT Scan (noncontrast) and its interpretation for differentiating these two types of stroke becomes imperative for early appropriate treatment of these patients. NINDS (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke) has defined critical-in-hospital time goals for assessment and management of patients suspected of having a stroke. These are as follows: 1. Patient to be assessed by the emergency physician or stroke team, within 10 minutes of arrival to the Emergency Department (ED) and urgent noncontrast CT head to be ordered. 2. Neurological assessment by the stroke team or neurologist and CT scan performed within 25 minutes of hospital arrival. 3. Interpretation of CT scan within 45 minutes of the arrival of the patient in the ED.Lesson 7: Disabilit y: Neurological Emergencies 894. Initiation of fibrinolytic therapy in appropriate patients within 1 hour of arrival of the patient in the ED. 5.

Decide if the patient is a candidate for fibrinolytic therapy. Arrange for a consultation with a neurologist or neurosurgeon.Review criteria for IV fibrinolytic therapy by using the fibrinolytic checklist. Consider transfer. Repeat the neurological exam (mNIHSS). If the patient is rapidly improving and moving towards normal, fibrinolytics may not be necessary. Step 7: Treatment, NINDS time goal: 60 min If the patient is a candidate for fibrinolytic therapy, review the risks and benefits of therapy with the patient and family (the main complication of IV tPA is intracranial hemorrhage) and give tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Do not give anticoagulants or antiplatelet treatment for 24 hours after tPA until a follow-up CT scan at 24 hrs does not show intracranial hemorrhage. If the patient is NoT a candidate for fibrinolytic therapy, give the patient aspirin.For both groups (those treated with tPA and those given aspirin), give the following basic stroke care:Begin the stroke pathway: Support the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation. v Check blood glucose and maintain levels between 140-180 mg/dl. v Patients with acute ischemic stroke who are hypoglycemic tend to have worse clinical outcomes, but there is no direct evidence that active glucose control improves outcome.

It includes various terms like coma, lethargy, stupor and obtundation.The term coma means a sleep-like state from which the patient is not arousable even with the painful stimulus. Lethargy, stupor and obtundation are states between alertness and coma. Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 94 Lesson 7: Disabilit y: Neurological EmergenciesEtiology The table below shows the important causes of altered sensorium. The causes can be remembered by the mnemonics \"TIPS\" and \"aeiou\" which are the vowels of English v alphabets. Table 7.7: Causes of lesions/ Stroke oxygen (hypoxia) uremia assessment and actions airway Airway should be opened with restriction of movements of the cervical spine in case of suspected v trauma. Intubate the patient if Glasgow coma scale is less than 8 or patient is hypoxic despite supplemental v oxygenation. Intubation may also be performed if the patient has features of raised intracranial pressure or shock. breathing and oxygenation All patients with altered mental status should be given supplemental oxygen even if oxygen saturation v is normal. Circulation It is crucial to maintain adequate cerebral perfusion in these patients. Therefore, maintain a mean v arterial pressure of at least 80 mmHg. If the patient is hypovolemic or hypotensive, administer adequate fluids intravenously . v disability and drugs Rule out the administration of sedatives and hypnotics. v Assess level of consciousness by Glasgow coma scale. v Consider administration of dextrose, Naloxone and Thiamine (discussed under the chapter on Acute v Poisoning). differential diagnosis history An abrupt onset of altered mental status indicates CNS hemorrhage/ischemia. v Progression of symptoms over hours to days suggests progressive CNS lesions or metabolic-toxic v causes. Preceding events like antecedent trauma, fever, seizure also help in differential diagnosis. v Medical history should include a history of comorbidities like COPD, Diabetes, cirrhosis, renal v disease, hypertension, similar prior episode, and drug (Recreational and Pharmaceutical) use. Lesson 7: Disabilit y: Neurological Emergencies 95assessment intracranial v hemorrhage. Hypotension may occur with sepsis, hypovolemia, cardiac failure or drug ingestion. v Hyperthermia suggests CNS or systemic infection, toxic ingestions and heat stroke. v Presence of hypothermia indicates a possibility of cold exposure, adrenal failure, hypothyroidism, v sepsis or intoxication (Carbon monoxide, oral antidiabetics, insulin, opioids, alcohol, sedatives).A warm and dry skin indicates anticholinergic toxicity. v A diaphoretic skin may indicate the presence of shock, fever or intoxication. v Skin rashes occur in meningococcal meningitis and sepsis. v Look for skin track marks which suggest drug abuse. v Breath odor may give a clue to diabetic ketoacidosis, hepatic/uremic encephalopathy or poisoning. v Presence of jaundice suggests hepatic failure. v Examine the lungs, heart and abdomen for any pathology. v Presence of scalp lacerations and contusions or skull deformity indicate trauma. v Look for signs of a basal skull fracture. These signs include a leak of CSF from the ear, hemotympanum, v CSF leak from the nose, periorbital ecchymosis or raccoon eyes and post-auricular ecchymosis or Battle sign. Neck rigidity should be elicited only after trauma to the cervical spine is excluded. v Pupils should be examined for size and reaction to light. In most of metabolic and many toxic causes v of altered sensorium, pupils are typically spared. If the patient is following commands, check extra-ocular movements. v If trauma is not present, Doll's eye maneuver may be used to check extra-ocular movements. v Examine the fundus for papilledema and signs of hypertension and subarachnoid bleed. v Motor and the sensory system should be examined for any asymmetry. v Similarly, deep tendon reflexes and plantar reflexes should be checked to localize an intracranial v lesion. diagnostic tests Check Blood Glucose and Treat Hypoglycemia. v Diagnostic tests are required to identify treatable conditions like infection, metabolic abnormalities, v seizure, intoxications, and surgical lesions. Diagnostic tests should be carried out simultaneously with the initial evaluation and treatment. v Important initial tests include CBC, electrolytes, Creatinine or blood urea, liver function tests, arterial blood gas, INR, cardiac troponin, urinalysis, ECG, and chest X-ray. If a diagnosis is not obvious, CT head and lumbar puncture may be required. v Treatment and disposition If a readily reversible cause of altered sensorium is found, the patient may be discharged after treatment v and sufficient observation if he regains normal baseline mental status and has reliable home care and follow up. Examples include anti-diabetic drug induced hypoglycemia, single seizure, opioid intoxication. Other patients will require admission. If facilities are not available, the patient should be referred to v appropriate hospital.Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor 7: y: Neurological EmergenciesScenario: altered Sensorium in diabetic k etoacidosis (dka) A 17 year girl was brought to your ED with altered sensorium for the past 2 hrs, parents had given a history of polydipsia, polyuria and rapid weight loss which started approximately one month ago and had worsened last week. The patient had not taken anything orally since yesterday and was complaining of abdominal pain and vomiting. How did you assess and managed this patient? assessment and actions Airway and Breathing: Quickly assessed her airway and breathing by talking to her, she was drowsy and confused, talking incoherently. The airway was clear as there were no secretions, blood or foreign body in the airway. There was an increase rate and depth of breathing (Kussmaul breathing). Respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, SpO 2 93%, had breath with a fruity odour. On auscultation of the chest, there were crepitations in the right lower chest. Started oxygen to maintain SpO2 above 94%. Circulation: Skin was pale and cold with poor skin turgor and dry mucous membranes.Pulse was 106/minute and 2 large IV(18G) and infused normal saline 500 ml in each IV rapidly.Took blood samples for blood sugar, S. electrolytes, KFT, LFT, S. chloride, complete Haemogram and ABG/ VBG, Urinalysis and ECG. Reassess vitals and found to have pulse rate 94/min, NIBP 110/70 mmHg, SpO 2 97%. Blood glucose strip test showed blood sugar of 520 mg/dl. Urine strip test for sugar +++ and Ketones ++.Disability/Neurological Disability: She was drowsy and confused, not talking coherently. GCS: Eye opening to painful stimuli (2), the Verbal response was mumbling and not talking coherently (3).Motor response was moving all four limbs and localizes to pain (5). Hence with GCS of 10/15Pupils were normal size, normal reacting.Assess and Reassess GCS, which improved with aggressive resuscitation & management.

Blood Glucose management Reassessed vitals Called the specialist physician & started definitive treatment. v Monitored 2 hourly: Blood sugar, serum electrolytes (K v+), Anion Gap, ABG, vitals, level of consciousness and urine output. goal Achieve blood glucose < 200 mg/dl, HCO v3- 18 and Venous pH > 7.3. Fluid administration As Hyperglycemia leads to osmotic diuresis, which leads to volume loss and loss of sodium, chloride, potassium, phosphorous, calcium and magnesium in the urine. Average water deficit in a patient of DKA is 100 ml/kg (5-10 litres), and sodium deficit is 7-10 mEq/kg. Normal saline is the fluid of choice in these patients, with 0.45% saline in the second IV line. Continued with aggressive fluid therapy in our patient with Normal Saline and 0.45% saline:First 1 litre of of Normal Saline administered within 2 hrs.Next 2 litres of fluid over 2 to 6 hrs. Switch to 0.45% saline if serum sodium is normal or high.Next 2 litres of fluid over 6 to 12 hrs. This replaces approximately 50% of total water deficit in 12 hours. When blood glucose was 250 mg/dl, the second IV line was changed to 5% dextrose.When blood sugar decreased below 180 mg/dl, 5% dextrose was started. potassium therapy Profound total body potassium deficit of 3 to 5 mEq/kg is present in the patient of DKA due to osmotic diuresis & vomiting. Severe hypokalemia is potentially the most life threatening electrolyte disorder which develops during treatment of DKA. Initial serum concentration of Potassium is normal or raised. Initial hypokalemia indicates severe total body potassium deficit and needs a replacement urgently. During initial fluid and insulin administration, serum potassium may fall rapidly leading to fatal cardiac arrhythmias, respiratory paralysis, paralytic ileus and >3.3 mEq/l and <5.3 mEq/l and urine output adequate, then give 20 mEq KCl per hour added to IV fluid for atleast 4 hours. Assessed & reassessed ECG, Serum potassium levels, urine output during resuscitation and treatment of DKA. Measured Serum Potassium every 2 hrly. Measured urine output. When oliguria was present, evaluated renal function and withheld or decreased potassium administration. Initial serum potassium was 5.4 mEq/l (> 5.3 mEq/l), indicating severe academia and volume depletion. Gave only IV fluids and Insulin till Serum potassium levels decreased.(For each 0.1 decrease in pH, serum potassium concentration rises by 0.5 mEq/l, and vice versa).If initial serum potassium would have been< 3.3 mEq/L.: Aggressive potassium replacement had to be done before insulin therapy was started, as insulin pushes potassium inside the cells and will cause further life threatening hypokalemia. Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Lesson 7: Disabilit y: Neurological EmergenciesMaintained serum potassium within the normal range of 4-5 mEq/l. Started oral potassium as soon as the patient could tolerate oral fluids. (KCl 20 mEq IV preferably in a central vein is administered over one hour, under close monitoring of ECG and hourly Serum potassium levels. A Total of 100-150 mEq of Potassium is required over 24 hours). Insulin Low dose regular insulin IV . infusion is safe, effective and flexible. Insulin is started after initial fluid bolus and hypokalemia (Serum potassium< 3.3 mEq/l) is excluded.Insulin is started by making Insulin solution with 100 units regular insulin diluted in 100 ml of Normal saline.Infusion rate/hr can be calculated by a formula:(Bl Sugar-100)/100 equal to units/hr.Insulin binds to plastic tubing hence flush IV tubing with 20 ml of insulin solution.Can administer insulin solution by syringe infusion pump or a microdrip set.Reassess Blood Sugar levels at an hourly interval and adjust the infusion rate.Blood glucose should decrease at 50 mg/dl/hr.The insulin infusion should be continued till ketones are absent in blood and anion gap has normalized.After stopping I.V . insulin infusion, switch to subcutaneous route with a combination of short and long- acting insulin. Consult an endocrinologist for further management. Bicarbonate Routine use of bicarbonate in the treatment of DKA is not recommended.I.V . fluids and insulin therapy inhibit lipolysis and correct ketoacidosis.Bicarbonate may be given in titrated doses in the following situations Severe academia (Ph <6.9). v Decreased cardiac contractility and peripheral vasodilation. v Life threatening hyperkalemia. v Coma. v Disadvantages of bicarbonate administration in DKA: Worsening severe hypokalemia. v Worsening intracellular acidosis. v Hypertonicity & sodium load. v Delayed recovery from ketoacidosis. v Increased lactate levels. v Cerebral edema. v Action: Reassess venous pH every 60 min.Magnesium & Calcium Assess Serum magnesium and serum calcium. Osmotic diuresis leads to depletion of magnesium from bone and hypomagnesemia. This inhibits parathyroid hormone If orally or parenterally 2 gms IV over 1 hour.Lesson 7: Disabilit y: Neurological Emergencies 99SEIzuRES Core concepts The patient with a seizure episode based on its presentation can be categorized as: First seizure v Recurrent seizures v Status epilepticus v Table 7.9: First episode of seizure: The seizure has stopped before presentation to hospital S. No. Assess Action 1. Provoked Seizure Identify and treat precipitating medical condition. No antiepileptic drug is required 2. Unprovoked seizure with no evidence of brain disease or injuryNo antiepileptic drug is required 3. Unprovoked seizure with a history of brain disease or injury in the pastAdminister anti-epileptic drug or may admit the patient for further evaluation. Patient present with recurrent seizures: having an active seizure Initial Stabilization: airway and breathing Assess: Look for patency of airway, the presence of secretions/frothing from the mouth, snoring. Check for injury to the tongue. Check for SpO2 (if available). Action: Call for help. Turn the patient in a lateral position (recovery position). Do oral suction and clear the airway. Administer Oxygen preferably by nasal prongs. If the patient is unable to protect airway or is hypoxic, intubate the patient. Ventilate the patient if respiratory efforts are inadequate. Protect him from getting injured. Circulation Assess: Attach monitors: ECG, NIBP and SpO2 (if not attached previously). Check vitals. Action: Secure an I/V line and start fluid, Check for blood sugar level. Neurological assessment Assess: A brief neurological exam should be conducted. Skin, pupils and vital signs should be evaluated for evidence of toxidromes. Check responsiveness and level of consciousness - GCS/A VPU score. Look for Pupils - size and reaction to light. Look for new onset weakness in face or limbs. Action: If GCS below 10 or falling, protect and secure airway with definitive airway device. If pupils unequal, decreased or absent reaction to light and altered sensorium/any motor or sensory deficit-urgent CT scan and neurosurgical/neurologist consultation. If the patient is having an active seizure: administer anticonvulsants. Status Epilepticus Convulsive status epilepticus is defined as a continuous convulsive seizure lasting for more than 5 min, or two or more seizures during which the patient does not return to baseline level of consciousness. Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 100 Lesson 7: Disabilit y: Neurological EmergenciesNElS approach of Status Epilepticus management Initial stabilization: as discussed for single active seizure history After initial stabilization, a brief history should be taken regarding: Time of onset and duration of the seizure. History of prior seizures, ingestion of toxins including ethanol. Associated symptoms preceding seizures like a headache and fever. Other medical history like trauma, cancer, HIV , TB, substance abuse, pregnancy or recent delivery. Investigations Blood sugar estimation. v CBC, Serum electrolytes (Sodium, Potassium, Calcium, Magnesium), anticonvulsant drug levels, v Ethanol level, and urine toxicology screen. ECG v CT head should be done after control of seizure activity. v Definitive Treatment Treatment and investigations proceed simultaneously. v First line of drug: v To abort active seizure: IV Benzodiazepines: Lorazepam: 0.1 mg/kg up to a maximum of 4 mg and is given over 2 minutes. \u0090 Diazepam: 0.15-0.2 mg/kg up to For refractory seizures: 0.05-2 mg/kg per hour to be till 24-48 hrs after seizure \u0090 control.Midazolam: 0.2 mg/kg IM or . of drug: v Anticonvulsants (Phenytoin or Fosphenytoin) if seizure activity fails to resolve within 5-10 minutes of benzodiazepine administration: Phenytoin: 20 mg/kg at a rate of not more than 50 mg/min. Rapid administration may produce mg/kg, 100-150 mg/minute. \u0090 If not responding to above treatment for more than 20 min., an additional dose of Fosphenetoin \u0090 or phenytoin 20-60 mg/kg (maximum 3.0 g) 3rd line drug: v Valproate, Phenobarbital and Propofol. Once seizures stop, look for potential complications: v If full consciousness not regained in 20-30 mins, it can be due to sedative effects of anticonvulsant \u0090 drugs. However, also consider poisoning, subarachnoid hemorrhage, meningitis, etc. Catheterize the patient to monitor for urine output and also look for myoglobinuria. Status epilepticus v can produce rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure. IV fluids are required to combat the hypotensive effects of drugs, prevent myoglobinuria-induced renal v failure, and maintain cerebral perfusion pressure. Control hyperthermia using external cooling methods. v Look for any injuries produced by convulsions. v Remember, a patient with poisoning can sustain trauma and seizures can be due to a head injury. vLesson 7: Disabilit y: Neurological Emergencies 101Table 7.10: Summary of management of status epilepticus Minutes of seizures Actions 0-5 minutes Maintain airway, breathing and circulation Administer oxygenInsert an IV lineObtain blood samples for glucose, urea, electrolytes, bilirubin, hemogram, acid-base analysis, toxicology screen Administer glucose (and thiamine) if hypoglycaemicElicit brief history and conduct a brief examination 5-10 minutes Administer diazepam or lorazepam 5-20 minutes Administer phenytoin or fosphenytoinRepeat diazepam or lorazepam if seizures persist Evaluate for intubation \u0090 20-60 phenobarbital infusion or propofolSupport of often \u0090 detailed a examination \u0090 >60 minutes Intubate and ventilate (if not done before) Administer general anesthetic agents (e.g. thiopental) with EEG \u0090 monitoring Admit in intensive care unit \u0090 Scenario: Seizure A 38 year man is brought to the ED with h/o sudden loss of consciousness with generalized abnormal jerky movements of all four limbs and facial muscles, accompanied by frothing from the mouth and uprolling of the eyes, about 15 to 20 minutes ago. airway and breathing Assessment: quickly assess the A & B.

Find the cause of the seizure by investigations like CT head.Rule out: metabolic derangements, intoxication, poisoning, trauma, medications, missing dose. aCuTE hEada ChE Core Concepts Identify life threatening and potentially serious cause. v Appropriate pain management after initial stabilization in all patients is important. v Response to pain therapy does not mean that the patient has a benign cause of a headache. v Acute headache is a common presentation in any ED. For the physician working in the ED, it is a challenge to determine whether the cause is relatively benign or there is a more sinister cause. The most common cause of the headache is the tension headache which occurs in nearly 50% cases. 10% are due to migraines and 30% are due to non-specific benign causes. 10% headaches are due to a potentially serious cause. Only 1% are due to a life-threatening cause. Etiology Some of the potentially serious causes of a headache are listed in table 7.11. Table 7.11: Potentially serious causes of an acute headache Head trauma Hematomas Subarachnoid hemorrhage infectionsAcute or Substance use or withdrawal Metabolic disorder Hypoxia, Hypercapnia, Hypoglycemia Evaluation Follow the ABCD approach. v History and physical examination should be conducted only after initial stabilization. vLesson 7: Disabilit y: Neurological Emergencies 103Focussed history History is important in determining possible cause and seriousness. Important questions in the evaluation are. Is it your first headache? v Do you get a headache on a regular basis and is the current episode same as before? v Is it the worst headache you are experiencing? v Are there any other symptoms before and during a headache? v Is the pain throbbing? v Are there any medical problems like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, diabetes, v or preceding trauma? Is there any history of use of any medicines or substance abuse? v Focussed Examination A detailed physical examination including CNS and fundus examination is required. v Red flags which may indicate a potentially serious underlying disorder . v Red flag features in a patient with an acute headache (SNOOP) S v ystemic symptoms (fever, weight loss); Secondary risk factors (HIV or cancer) N v eurologic features (confusion, papilledema, focal deficits, nuchal rigidity , visual disturbances) o v nset (sudden, abrupt, split-seconds to minutes) o v lder (new onset or a progressive headache above 50 years of age) p v rogression (a major change from previous attacks in term of severity, frequency or clinical features) Table 7.12: Common underlying pathologies in presence of a red flag First or worst headache CNS infection, intracranial hemorrhage Focal neurologic signs A V malformation, intracranial mass Triggered by a cough/exertion Mass lesion, SAH Change in mental status CNS infection, intracerebral bleed, mass lesion Neck stiffness/meningism Meningitis, SAH thunderclap headache) Bleeding into a mass, subarachnoid hemorrhage New headache type in a patient with cancer, HIV or above 50 yearsMetastasis, opportunistic CNS infections, mass lesion, temporal arteritis management Assessment & action regarding ABC as per NELS approach is required. v If the patient has features suggestive of meningitis like fever, headache, neck stiffness, photophobia, v send blood cultures, start steroids and antibiotics and then investigate further with a CT scan and lumbar puncture. If there is no fever but the headache was of sudden onset with a peak within seconds to minutes, v consider a possibility of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Even if the headache is not like a thunderclap, but suspicion of SAH is present due to other features like neck rigidity and cranial nerve palsies, a CT is required. After ensuring ABCs of the patient, get a non-contrast CT scan of the brain. If it is negative, refer to a specialist or perform a lumbar puncture to look for RBCs or xanthochromia. Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency t 104 Lesson 7: Disabilit y: Neurological EmergenciesIf there are no features to suggest SAH, look for red flags that are SNOOP. If present, get urgent CT v and neurologist consultation. If red flags are not present and the patient gives a history of recurrent episodes of a headache of v similar quality, consider benign causes and give pain management. Intravenous paracetamol and metoclopramide can be given. If it is suggestive of a migraine and there is no relief with paracetamol then oral/intranasal sumatriptan may be given. If the patient is pregnant, in the post-partum period, on oral contraceptives, has a history suggestive v of sinusitis, otitis media, mastoiditis or malignancy consider central vein thrombosis. Additional features in this condition may include vomiting, seizures, visual symptoms, motor deficits, or altered mental status. After adequate hydration, consider referral for urgent CT or CT venography or MR venography. Remember to give appropriate pain management after initial stabilization in all patients with v a headache, as this is often forgotten if a sinister cause is suspected. However, it is important to remember that response to pain therapy in the ED does not mean that the patient has a benign cause of headache. Scenario 1: acute migraine headache A 24 year girl presents with a gradual onset of a severe headache over a few hours assessment and action history: Location: Bifrontal headache, Associated features: nausea and phonophobia. No fever, recent illness, or any trauma, she had similar episodes of a headache in the past.Examination: Vitals are normal, No red flag features. Management Reassurance that it is most probably Migraine. Paracetamol, parentral (1000 mg infusion) plus metoclopramide (10 mg).In those patients not responding to treatment after two hours, escalate treatment to Sumatriptan (25 mg), by oral or intranasal route. If the patient still does not respond, then use: Sumatriptan 6 mg subcutaneous injection. v Antiemetics: v Metoclopramide 10 mg intravenous (IV) or, \u0090 Prochlorperazine 10 mg IV or intramuscular (IM) or, \u0090 Chlorpromazine ranging from 0.1 mg/kg IV to a total dose of 25 mg IV . \u0090 Ketorolac 30 mg IV or 60 mg IM. v For the patients, who are treated in the emergency department for the migraine headache with one of a standard migraine abortive therapies, we recommend adjunctive treatment with dexamethasone (4-8 mg IV) to reduce the risk of early headache recurrence. Scenario 2: head Injury A 35 year male who came with persistent headache for 2 days. He had a collision while driving a bike 2 days ago. He has difficulty in concentrating and has dizziness. His vitals are normal and physical examination is normal. The red flag here is a significant history of trauma and even though his examination is normal, he requires a CT to be done before disposition.Lesson 7: Disabilit y: Neurological Emergencies 105assessment and actions Discussed in Head Injury Chapter. bIblIOgRaPhy 1.

Introduction Head Injury is defined as any trauma to scalp, skull or brain. Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) term is also often used to describe Head Injury. This can be further subdivided as Primary brain injury and Secondary brain injury. Primary brain injury is caused by a direct insult to the brain tissue during a traumatic event, whereas secondary brain injury is an indirect and delayed brain injury that occurs hours and days after the primary injury. It is caused by a complex process which includes intracranial, extra cranial or systemic insults.ObjECTIvES Upon completion of the lesson the trainee would be able to: Assess and Manage v Head Injury \u0090 Chest Trauma \u0090 Abdomen & Pelvic Trauma \u0090 Musculoskeletal Trauma \u0090 Spine Trauma and \u0090 Safe Patient Transport Burn injury \u0090Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t , Abdomen, Pelvis , Musculoskeletal, Spine and BurnCauses of secondary hyperthermia. The damage to the brain during primary brain injury is irreversible, however, the secondary brain insults can be prevented. This is the primary goal of management of the head injury. Neuroanatomy Scalp: The scalp has a very rich blood supply. Scalp lacerations can cause significant blood loss as the blood vessels do not retract. This can cause haemorrhagic shock especially in paediatric age group. Application of a direct pressure on the wound and suturing with deep sutures helps in control of bleeding. Skull: The base of the skull is irregular and during acceleration and deceleration, the movement of the brain against it can cause significant injury.Meninges: The dura mater, arachnoid mater and pia mater form the three layers of meninges. Superficial cerebral veins and the dural venous sinuses are connected by Bridging Veins and trauma to these bridging veins result in formation of the Subdural hematoma. The injury to the middle meningeal artery, dural sinuses and skull fracture are the important causes of Extradural hematoma. Neurophysiology The normal Intracranial pressure (ICP) is mmHg by various autoregulatory mechanisms and ICP>20 mmHg results in poor cerebral perfusion. In adults, normal cerebral blood flow is 50-55 ml/100 gm of brain tissue per min. The Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CPP) is the difference between Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) and Intracranial Pressure (ICP), i.e. CPP=MAP-ICP. The autoregulation of blood flow of normal brain occurs between a MAP of 50-150 mmHg. In head injury, this autoregulation is disrupted which results in the inability of the brain to compensate for the changes in mean arterial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure. Thus the main principle in the management of head injury is to maintain cerebral perfusion and blood flow. The intracranial content comprises of arterial blood, venous blood, brain tissue and Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF). The Monroe Kelley Doctrine states that the total volume of intracranial content, i.e. arterial blood, venous blood, brain tissue and CSF remains constant. In head injury, the initial stage of the compensatory mechanism is achieved by a decrease in CSF volume and venous blood. When this compensation is exhausted, there is a rise in ICP and decrease in arterial volume, which further worsens the cerebral insult. glasgow Coma Scale (gCS) Glasgow coma scale is a simple and rapid method of assessing the level of consciousness. It has three components: Eye (E), Verbal (V), Motor (M) response to external stimuli. The maximum score is 15 and the minimum score is 3. The best motor response to a painful stimulus is observed as a movement of arms and not of legs as the movement of legs may be a part of spinal withdrawal reflex. Examination of a head injury patient should include GCS, size of pupils and pupillary response to light. The assessment of lateralizing signs should also be done. The first measurement is made on admission and if GCS is recorded while the patient is being resuscitated, then it should be mentioned and later re-evaluated. The serial recordings of GCS are made to evaluate the progress of injury and response to treatment. The scale has been modified in paediatric patients, however, the adult scale can be used in a child of 5 years and more of age. Eye Response: It is better elicited by applying pressure on the nail bed, because the supraorbital pressure may cause grimacing, resulting in eye closure. Motor Response: Painful stimulus is applied on head and neck region or supraorbital notch or styloid process. The response is observed as a movement of arms and not of legs, as the movement of legs have more limited range of movement and the response may also take place as part of spinal withdrawal reflex. Lesson 8: Trauma: Head, Chest , Abdomen, Pelvis , Musculoskeletal, Spine and Burn 109The best motor response is elicited and spinal injury should be excluded if an asymmetrical response is observed. M5 - Localizing to the painful stimulus or hand reaches above the clavicle. M4 - A flexion response, where the elbow flexes but does not localize. Shoulder adduction, elbow flexion, supination and elbow flexion are observed. M3 - An abnormal flexion response with some degree of elbow flexion, but no supination. M2 - An extension response with adduction of shoulders, an extension of elbows and pronation. M1 - No movement.

Classification of head Injuries There are various ways of classifying head injury, the commonest are on the basis of the mechanism of injury, the severity of injury and morphology, and lesion can be focal or diffuse. Table 8.1: Classification of Head Injuries Mechanism of InjurySeverity of injury - on the basis , Abdomen, Pelvis , Musculoskeletal, Spine and BurnClinical pearls In open head injury, the prevention of infection is very important. \u0083 In depressed skull fracture, always rule out the underlying brain injury, intracranial hematoma, \u0083 contusion and open head injury. Surgical exploration is required in depressed skull fracture if it is an open, and contaminated \u0083 skull fracture. The degree of depression more than that of the adjacent skull also requires surgical intervention. In Basilar fracture, look for Periorbital ecchymosis (Raccoon Eyes), retroauricular ecchymosis \u0083 (Battle's sign), hemotympanum, bleeding from nose, CSF leak from the nose or ears, seventh and eight nerve dysfunction. The CSF leak can be confirmed by the presence of glucose in CSF, and this can be tested bed \u0083 side by Dextrosix.Intracranial mass lesions always require neurosurgical consultation. \u0083 Computerised Tomography (CT scan) is the most important investigating tool used for diagnosis of head injury. Indications of CT Scan In all patients with moderate (GCS 9-12) and severe head injury (GCS 3-8). v In Basilar skull fracture. v In open or depressed skull fracture. v In patients of mild head injury with gCS 13-15 Associated with a focal neurological deficit. v History of seizures. v GCS <15 after 2 hours of injury. v History of more than 2 episodes of vomiting. v Loss of consciousness >5 mins. v Retrograde amnesia > 30 mins. v The NElS approach for assessment and management of head injury In patients of head injury, the NELS approach of assessment and management of the Airway, Breathing and Circulation is followed by Disability or neurological assessment. The primary goal of management is to prevent secondary brain injury. The maintenance of adequate oxygenation and blood pressure ensures adequate cerebral oxygenation and perfusion. Therefore, it is the cornerstone of treatment in preventing secondary brain injury. Airway: In patients of head injury, the association of cervical spine injury should always be kept in mind. It is important to protect cervical spine by using any immobilizing device such as a cervical collar or use of manual in line stabilization before undertaking any procedures which involve any neck movement. Other associated faciomaxillary injuries should always be excluded. Unconscious patients may require tracheal intubation for airway protection, and it is essential in all patients of severe head injury with GCS <9. Breathing: Assess and manage breathing. Adequate oxygenation and ventilation should be achieved in order to maintain SpO 2>94% and normocapnia (PaCO2 35 mmHg approx) to prevent secondary brain injury. Circulation: Prevent hypotension (maintain systolic BP 100 mmHg) by haemorrhage control and adequate fluid, blood and blood products resuscitation. This is the most vital step in preventing secondary brain injury and improving morbidity and mortality in head injury. The fluids administered should be isotonic fluids such as Normal saline and Ringer Head, and Burn 111Disability/Neurological assessment and management: The head injury is diagnosed on the basis of history, signs and symptoms of head trauma and the presence of decreased neurological function. The clinical features are decided by the severity of injury, morphology and anatomical site of injury. Measurement of Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), pupillary signs and focussed neurological examination form an integral component of examination of head injury. The signs of basilar skull fracture should always be looked for. Surgical management Depressed skull fracture, intracranial mass lesions (extradural hematoma, subdural hematoma and cerebral contusions and hematoma) and penetrating skull trauma require neurosurgical consultation and may require surgical intervention. management of head injury All patients with Moderate and Severe head injury need neurosurgical consultation and should be transferred to an appropriate neurosurgical facility for further management. These patients should be transferred at the earliest after management of airway, breathing and circulation and achieving adequate hemodynamic stability. mild head injury gCS 13-15 Assess and manage airway, breathing, circulation and undertake a focussed neurological examination. v Rule out cervical spine injury. v Always rule out other associated injuries. v Elicit a history of the mechanism of injury, loss of consciousness, any episodes of vomiting, headache v and its severity and retrograde amnesia. Always rule out alcohol or any drug intake. v If CT scan is available and it is indicated (as per the indications listed earlier), CT scan can be done. However, if the clinical condition of the patient requires early transfer to a higher centre, do not do CT scan.

Avoid hyperventilation, do not decrease PaCO \u00832< 32 mmHg. Hypotension/haemorrhagic shock is very rarely caused by isolated head injury. Intracranial \u0083 haemorrhage does not cause haemorrhagic shock. If the head injury is accompanied with hypotension, other associated injuries (chest trauma, abdominal trauma, pelvic injuries, limb injuries) should always be ruled out. These associated injuries are the primary cause of hypotension/haemorrhagic shock in these patients. Administration of isotonic intravenous fluids should be started at the earliest to prevent and \u0083 manage hypotension. Blood and blood products should also be transfused, according to the requirement of the patient. Focussed Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) should be done in all comatose \u0083 patients to rule out any associated abdominal injury.Do \u0083 Not administer glucose containing solutions as hyperglycaemia is harmful to the injured brain and contributes to secondary brain injury. Hyponatremia also causes secondary brain injury, so close monitoring of serum sodium is \u0083 also important.The presence of alcohol and drugs should always be ruled out in the evaluation of a head \u0083 injury.Mannitol, hypertonic saline and anticonvulsants can be given in consultation with a \u0083 neurosurgeon. However, mannitol should not be given to a patient with hypovolaemia.There is no role of steroids in the management of head injury. \u0083Lesson 8: Trauma: Head, Chest , Abdomen, Pelvis , Musculoskeletal, Spine and Burn 113SCENaRIOS Scenario 1 A 28 year male presents in an emergency with a history of motorcycle accident.

Esophageal injury. Pathophysiology of Chest Injuries Chest injuries affect both oxygenation and perfusion and can cause hypoxia, hypercarbia, and acidosis leading to morbidity and mortality. hypoxia of tissues occurs due to the following reasons: Adverse effects on Airway & Breathing: v Decreased oxygen delivery due to airway obstruction. \u0090 Inadequate ventilation due to changes in intrathoracic pressures in conditions like tension \u0090 pneumothorax and open pneumothorax. Ventilation-perfusion mismatch in conditions like a pulmonary contusion, hematomas and \u0090 alveolar collapse. Adverse effects on Circulation: v Blood loss leading to hypovolemia which causes a decrease in the oxygen carrying capacity and \u0090 decreased oxygen delivery to the tissues. hypercarbia occurs because of inadequate ventilation.Lesson 8: Trauma: Head, Abdomen, 117Acidosis occurs to: Hypoperfusion and hypoxia of tissues anaerobic metabolic \u0090 acidosis. Hypercarbia causing respiratory acidosis. \u0090 assessment of a Chest Injury victim Assess Airway, Breathing, and Circulation and attach monitors (SpO2, EtCO2, NIBP and ECG). Examine the neck and chest and consider the mechanism of injury in anticipating the type and nature of injuries. look for Distended neck veins signifying raised jugular venous pressure. v Neck and chest injury, swelling, bruising, contusion, penetrating wound and haematoma. v The symmetry of chest movements, respiratory rate and depth of respiration. v Signs of laboured or abnormal breathing, chest deformity, and any flail segment. v Cyanosis. v Capillary refill time. v listen for Talk to the patient. If the patient is talking in a clear voice, it is an indication that the airway is patent. A v change in the voice like hoarseness or noisy breathing like stridor, snoring or gurgling sound, signifies obstructed breathing. Percuss the chest bilaterally to observe whether the percussion note is hyper-resonant, dull,or v normal.Auscultate the chest to check for bilateral air entry if present or not, whether breath sounds are equal v on both sides and if any adventitious sounds like crepitations or ronchi can be heard.Auscultate the heart for heart sounds and note if well heard or muffled. v Listen for carotid bruit over the neck. v Feel for The position of the trachea, ascertain if it is central or deviated to one side. v Palpate chest wall for any crepitus or subcutaneous emphysema signifying underlying injury to the v bony rib cage.Palpate chest wall for tenderness or bony fragments. v action Airway: v Maintain a patent airway by chin lift and jaw thrust techniques or using the OPA/NPA in unconscious patients.Administer oxygen, monitor SpO v2 and maintain SpO2 94% by ensuring a patent airway, adequate ventilation and providing supplemental oxygen.Breathing: If the patient has rapid, shallow ineffective breathing or is apnoeic, assist ventilation with v bag valve mask with a reservoir bag (BVM) with oxygen at high flows of 12-15 L/min.

Palpable fracture of the larynx may be confirmed with a CT neck, but this should be done only if the patients' vitals are stable and laryngeal injury cannot be confirmed. Scenario 2 A young motorcyclist riding at high speed crashes into two labourers carrying metal pipes. He is brought to the Emergency Department (ED) complaining of pain in the neck, hoarseness, and difficulty in breathing. assessment and action The patient is complaining of pain in the neck, hoarseness, and difficulty in breathing. v On examination, bruising and swelling in the neck and subcutaneous emphysema is observed with a v SpO2 of 82%. Administer high flow oxygen and apply cervical collar using MILS. Patient has an obvious difficulty in breathing, so attempt to secure the airway by direct orotracheal v intubation taking care not to create a false passage. If unsuccessful, surgical airway should be secured at the earliest. v During airway management, continue oxygen administration at high flows. v Tracheobronchial Injury (abC) Injury to the trachea or a major bronchus comprises a tracheobronchial injury, which is usually seen in rapid deceleration following blunt trauma, blast injuries and penetrating injuries. Though these injuries are uncommon, when they occur, they are potentially fatal and many patients die at the scene of the accident. Majority of the tracheobronchial injuries occur within 1\" of the carina. The high morbidity and mortality are due to loss of or an inadequate airway, tension pneumothorax or development of a tension pneumopericardium. The patient presents with signs and symptoms of haemoptysis, cyanosis, cervical subcutaneous emphysema and a continued large air leak even after placement of an adequate sized intercostal drain (ICD). Bronchoscopy confirms the diagnosis.Management includes securing a definitive airway. Intubate trachea cautiously preferably with the help of a Fibre Optic Bronchoscope (FOB) and a selective endobronchial intubation of the unaffected side may be helpful. Definite treatment is Immediate Operative Intervention for sur gical repair. Tension Pneumothorax Tension pneumothorax is a life threatening condition, which if not recognized and treated promptly can be fatal. Diagnosis of a tension pneumothorax is based on clinical signs and symptoms and failure to recognize it has led to many a patient dying in the emergency department or the radiological suite.Lesson 8: Trauma: Head, Chest and Burn 119Tension pneumothorax develops when air accumulates in the pleural space via a one way valve mechanism which permits the air to enter but not exit the pleural space. This air may enter either from a breach in lung parenchyma or through chest wall injury. Air keeps building up in the pleural space with each breath, more so with positive pressure ventilation, leading to a rise in pressure which causes the affected lung to collapse. The mediastinum eventually gets pushed to the opposite side leading to compression of the great blood vessels and the opposite lung leading to a decrease in venous return due to increased intrathoracic pressure. This decreased venous return causes a marked fall in cardiac output causing the patient to present in obstructive shock. If the pressure is not relieved, the dramatic decrease in cardiac output will ultimately cause death. The commonest cause of an iatrogenic tension pneumothorax is positive pressure ventilation in patients of chest trauma, especially those with a breach in visceral pleura. Placement of a central venous catheter through the subclavian or Internal Jugular vein is also a known cause of iatrogenic tension pneumothorax. In blunt chest trauma, the fractured rib end may puncture the lung while in penetrating trauma, penetration of lung parenchyma leads to this condition. Both simple and open pneumothorax can convert to tension pneumothorax, the later by sealing the external chest wall opening on all four sides, thus preventing air from escaping to the atmosphere. Another cause of tension pneumothorax may be a significantly displaced thoracic spine fracture. Patients having a tension pneumothorax present with severe breathing difficulty and air hunger along with chest pain if they are breathing on their own. Patients of chest trauma on artificial ventilation present with cardiovascular collapse termed obstructive shock. Signs and symptoms: Patient presents with all or some of the following symptoms namely chest pain, dyspnea, anxiety, tachypnea, tachycardia, hyper-resonance of the chest wall and diminished/absent breath sounds on the affected side. Late findings are distension of neck veins (may not be present if associated with severe hypovolemia), tracheal deviation towards the contralateral side, air hunger, circulatory shock, elevated chest on the affected side without much movement, decreased level of consciousness and cyanosis. Tension pneumothorax is a clinical diagnosis and time should not be wasted in getting X-ray chest done as immediate chest decompression can be life saving. E FAST is a quick way of diagnosing tension pneumothorax on the bedside. Scenario 3 Two friends were driving a car at midnight after a booze party. The car was found by the passing villagers in a ditch with the driver dead and the passenger without a seat belt.On arrival in the hospital, the patient is clutching his chest, struggling to breath and looking distressed. NElS approach to the patient Airway: v Airway is patent as the patient is talking, SpO2 is 85%. Administer oxygen through high flow non-rebreathing oxygen mask. Breathing: v Respiratory rate is 40/min, shallow and patient is distressed. Neck veins appear distended and trachea is shifted to the left. There is hyper-resonant percussion note and no breath sounds on the right side of the chest. In E-FAST, look for seashore, barcode or stratosphere sign in M mode. Patient has tension pneumothorax in the right side of chest so immediately a right sided needle v thoracentesis is done with a large over the needle catheter in the 5th Intercostals Space (ICS) just anterior to the mid axillary line in adults (2nd ICS in midclavicular line for children) is performed and a gush of air comes out. It is followed by ICD on the right side of chest with 28-32 Fr chest drain tube, which is connected to an underwater seal and bubbling of air is seen. On re-assessing, there is an improvement in breathing, the patient feels comfortable, SpO v2 increases to 95% and air entry significantly improves on the right side of the chest.Circulation: v Initial BP was 80/40 mmHg, Pulse 120/min. After chest tube insertion, Pulse is and BP is 110/70 mmHg.Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor management: v Secure vascular access and administer crystalloids. Get blood grouping and cross matching. Administer antibiotics and an I/V analgesic. Take surgical consultation. Perform investigations if the patient is stable and time permits for X-ray chest or CT. Open Pneumothorax/Sucking Chest Wound Open pneumothorax is also known as sucking chest wound. This occurs due to a large wound or defect of the chest wall, the size of which is more than or equal to 2/3rd the diameter of the trachea. Due to this large gap in the chest wall, equilibration of pressure between the intrapleural space and atmosphere occurs. Air tends to follow the path of least resistance so when the patient inspires, air enters the thoracic cavity preferentially from the chest wound rather than the trachea. This leads to accumulation of air in the pleural cavity leading to the collapse of the lung on the injured side which causes impaired ventilation, hypoxia and hypercarbia. Scenario 4 A middle aged man involved in a fight over gambling gets stabbed with a large knife in the back on right upper half of chest. The assailant pulls out the knife and leaves the man bleeding on the roadside. A bystander brings him to the hospital. He looks dusky, is complaining of difficulty in breathing, is very anxious and saying please save me or I will die. A large sucking wound is seen on the back on right upper half of chest. assessment Airway is patent as the patient is talking and complaining of difficulty in breathing and pain in the v chest. Breathing is rapid and shallow with a respiratory rate of 40/min. Air entering the wound is making a typical sucking sound. Accessory muscles of respiration are working and the patient is in obvious respiratory distress. Colour of the patient is dusky and SpO 2 is 78%. action Administer Oxygen at high flows by a face mask with reservoir to maintain SpO v2 of >94%. The defect in the chest wall is sealed immediately with a sterile partially occlusive dressing, applied on three sides of the wound, leaving the lower side open. Regardless of hole size, an occlusive dressing is taped on three sides. Clean the area around the wound prior to applying a two inch tape on three sides. Now as the patient inspires, the dressing occludes the wound and hence air does not enter the pleural cavity. On expiration, air from the pleural space exits from the open lower margin of the occlusive dressing. An intercostal drain/chest tube is inserted away from the wound as soon as possible to decompress the v pleural cavity. Definitive treatment is a surgical closure of the wound in the operation theatre, so call for early surgical v help. Cardiac Tamponade Cardiac tamponade develops when there is an accumulation of fluid/blood in the pericardi al sac resulting in compression of the heart, thus preventing it from functioning effectively and leading to the low cardiac output state. The pericardium is a fibrous structure and therefore even a small amount of blood can restrict action of the heart. Commonest cause of cardiac tamponade is penetrating trauma, though blunt trauma may also be a cause. The source of blood collection in the pericardial sac may be from the heart, great vessels or epicardial vessels. The three typical signs of cardiac tamponade are muffled heart sounds, low blood pressure due to a decrease in stroke volume and jugular-venous distension due to impaired venous return to the heart - these form the Beck's triad. Cardiac tamponade is a life threatening condition requiring urgent drainage done by pericardiocentesis, If fluid continues to accumulate in the pericardial sac, with each successive diastole, less blood enters the ventricles. Eventually, increasing pressure on the heart forces the interventricular septum to bend towards the left ventricle, leading to a decrease in stroke volume. This causes obstructive shock, which will lead to cardiac arrest (often presenting as pulseless electrical activity) if untreated.Lesson 8: Trauma: Head, Pelvis of tamponade are: Pulsus Paradoxus (a drop of at least 10 mmHg in arterial blood pressure with inspiration), v ST segment changes on the electrocardiogram, which may also show low voltage QRS complexes, v General signs and symptoms of shock (such as fast heart rate, shortness of breath and decreasing level v of consciousness). Some of these signs may not be present in all cases. v Scenario 5 During kite flying on the terrace a young boy falls from the parapet onto the roof of the house below, over the T.V. antenna which pierces his chest. He is brought to the ED in shock, with the antenna sticking out of the left chest wall. assessment and action Airway: v Patient is talking, the airway is patent. Administer high flow oxygen (12-15 L/min) via facemask with a reservoir bag. Attach monitors and monitor SpO2, NIBP, ECG. SpO2 is 90%. Breathing: v Rapid shallow respiration, B/L breath sounds present and equal. Neck veins are engorged and trachea is central. v A broken T.V . antenna is seen jutting out of the left anterior chest wall, medial to the midclavicular line. v Caution: v Do not try and remove the foreign body (broken T.V . antenna) in the emergency department. This will be done in the operation theatre by the surgeon. Early surgical intervention is required, hence asked for an urgent surgical consultation for definitive v management.Circulation: v Patient is in shock with tachycardia (HR 140/min), cold and clammy skin, CRT >2 secs., NIBP 86/56 muffled.A rise in Jugular venous pressure is seen with inspiration in this patient breathing spontaneously - v Kussmaul's sign (a true paradoxical venous pressure abnormality).ECG shows low voltage QRS complexes, tachycardia with occasional ventricular ectopic beats (PEA v may be seen).FAST is positive for the pericardial window. v Beck's triad, i.e. raised CVP, decreased arterial pressure and muffled heart sounds are present suggesting v the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade which has been confirmed by FAST.Secure two large bore I/V lines, withdraw blood samples for grouping and cross matching and transfuse v isotonic crystalloids followed by blood after grouping and cross matching.Evacuate blood in pericardial sac by pericardiocentesis under ECG monitoring and ultrasound v guidance preferably.Need to leave catheter in situ for repeated aspiration of blood from the pericardial sac till definitive v operative intervention is achieved in the operating room.Emergency surgical consultation and operative intervention are sought for definitive treatment of v cardiac tamponade. massive haemothorax Bleeding into the pleural space is known as haemothorax and can occur with disruption of systemic or hilar blood vessels of the chest. Haemothorax is usually a consequence of a blunt or penetrating trauma. A rapid collection of 1500 ml of blood in the pleural cavity of an adult patient is known as Massive Haemothorax, the most common cause being a penetrating wound disrupting the systemic or hilar blood vessels. The physiologic response to the development of a massive haemothorax is manifested as respiratory and haemodynamic derangements. Patients of massive haemothorax present with signs and symptoms of Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 122 , Abdomen, Pelvis , Musculoskeletal, Spine and Burnhaemorrhagic shock. Neck veins are flat unless there is associated tension pneumothorax. Breath sounds are diminished or absent on the affected side and percussion note is dull. The effect of a large accumulation of blood within the pleural space will cause abnormalities of ventilation and oxygenation. These changes lead to hypoxia, ventilation perfusion mismatch, hypercarbia, and acidosis. management All patients should be administered high flow oxygen, rapid intravenous fluids, and blood, while simultaneously decompressing the chest by insertion of 28 to 32G intercostal drainage tube inserted in 5th intercostal space just anterior to midaxillary line. Consider autotransfusion. The upright chest radiograph is the ideal primary diagnostic study in the evaluation of haemothorax. Indications of Surgical exploration in traumatic haemothorax: Evacuation of more than 1500 ml of blood immediately after tube thoracostomy with haemodynamic instability, continued bleeding from the chest, 150-200 ml/hr for 2-4 hours and if a repeated blood transfusion is required to maintain haemodynamic stability, all are indications for thoracotomy by a surgeon. Scenario 6 A 25 year boy was driving a car at high speed and had a head on collision with a tree. The car was found by the passing villagers with the patient crying for help and his chest lying against a bent steering wheel. On arrival in the hospital, the patient is conscious and talking, having breathing difficulty, dizziness, looking pale and distressed. assessment and action Airway: On the assessment of airway patency, he is talking in a clear voice but complaining of difficulty in breathing. Administer Oxygen and attach a SpO2 monitor and apply cervical collar using MILS. Breathing: Neck veins are not distended, the trachea is central, on bilateral chest examination there is decreased movement on the left side of the chest. Rate and depth of respiration is rapid with a rate of 34/min & shallow. The SpO 2 is 90%. The patient is in respiratory distress. The left side of the chest has visible bruise, decreased movement and breath sounds, crepitus is felt and percussion note is dull. Bedside X-ray Chest shows left sided haemothorax. Perform tube thoracostomy and insert chest tube 28-32 French size, on left side in 5th intercostal space slightly anterior to midaxillary line. Chest tube drains 1000 ml of blood. Repeat X-ray Chest. Circulation: The patient is pale, sweating and restless. Pulse is 130/min, BP is 84/60 mm, he has cold extremities and capillary refill time is > 2 secs. Start IV line with two wide bore cannula, administer warm crystalloids 1L boluses over 10-15 min. Send sample for blood grouping and cross matching. Arrange blood and blood products and transfuse as soon as possible. Observe the rate of blood loss from chest drain. Ask for surgical/cardiothoracic consultation immediately. Traumatic Circulatory arrest unconscious trauma patients with no pulse including pEA are considered to be in circulatory arrest. There may be a preceding cardiac event.Causes of traumatic circulatory arrest are: Extreme hypovolaemia. v Severe v Tension 123Cardiac herniation. v Severe myocardial contusion. v Diagnosis of these patients is based on clinical findings, i.e. patient being unconscious and with no pulse.

Definitive Rx - needle thoracocentesis/ICD/Pericardiocentesis. v Resuscitative thoracotomy - 10% survival. v Flail Chest with Pulmonary Contusion Flail chest is a condition in which a segment of the chest wall becomes discontinuous with the rest of the chest wall. It is usually due to chest trauma, leading to multiple rib fractures and a flail segment occurs when there is a fracture of two or more contiguous ribs at two or more places. This segment moves paradoxically during ventilation. The underlying lung injury caused by the fractured ribs and the forces at play during the traumatic incidence cause oedema and accumulation of blood in the alveolar spaces, leading to disruption of normal lung structure and function. An inflammatory reaction to the presence of blood in the lung tissue occurs. All these changes lead to an impaired gas exchange, hypoxia, hypercarbia, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, a decreased lung compliance and finally respiratory failure. A mortality is mainly due to ARDS and respiratory failure that develops over a few days. Significant pulmonary contusion requires endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Pneumonia and atelectasis add to the morbidity and mortality in this group of patients.

If not recognized and treated promptly, it can be disastrous for the patient. Associated brain and spinal cord injury, use of illicit drugs, alcohol intoxication etc. may make it difficult to assess abdomen and pelvis properly. The abdominal injury should be suspected in any patient who is involved in a high speed motor vehicle accident, has had a fall from a height, has penetrating wounds between nipple and perineum and who has been exposed to explosions. A high index of suspicion based on the injury mechanism, systematic thorough examination, and diagnostic investigations can help the clinician in arriving at the correct diagnosis in a majority of the patients. abdominal injuries In any trauma victim, it is mandatory to maintain and protect a patent airway with cervical spine stabilization and maintain proper breathing and ventilation before assessing the patient for abdominal injuries. Initial assessment includes assessing for signs of circulatory compromise - Check pulse, BP, pulse pressure, capillary refill, diaphoresis, cold clammy skin, O 2 saturation, etc. Examination of abdomen Inspection: v Look for any bruises, abrasions, penetrating wound, evisceration, entry and exit wounds in case of bullet injuries. palpation: v Look for guarding, rigidity, tenderness, rebound tenderness. percussion: v Look for free fluid in the abdomen, obliteration of liver dullness.

A high index of suspicion, systematic abdominal examination and a few simple diagnostic investigations help in clinching the diagnosis. Hemodynamically unstable patients require urgent laparotomy for control of hemorrhage. However hemodynamically stable patients can be observed safely. Early surgical consultation and transfer whenever indicated is mandatory for better outcome. muSCulOSkElET al TRauma Core Concepts Multiple musculoskeletal injuries imply that the patient has sustained an injury with a considerable v force and other life-threatening associated injuries should be ruled out. Pelvic and long bone fractures are frequently associated with major blood loss. v The crush injuries of the limbs may affect the renal system due to myoglobinuria. v Inappropriate management of compartment syndrome may be limb threatening. v Long limb fractures may be associated with fat embolism which may be life- threatening. v Many musculoskeletal injuries may not be detected in the initial evaluation of the patient. A repeat v assessment and high index of suspicion based on the mechanism of injury is warranted. In compartment syndrome, the absence of a pulse is a usually a late finding and thus presence of a v pulse may not rule out occurrence of compartment syndrome. Introduction Trauma patients with multiple injuries are often associated with musculoskeletal injuries. These injuries may appear devastating but if managed appropriately are not an immediate threat to life or limb. Musculoskeletal injuries may present as crush injuries, fractures, dislocations, sprain, and stress fractures. Irrespective of the etiology, the musculoskeletal trauma is associated with bleeding, pain, psychological stress and inflammatory response depending on the severity of the trauma and traumatized tissue vascularity. The primary goal in the management of such injuries includes prevention of further disability, anticipation, and prevention of further complications and optimization and maintenance of physiology. NElS approach to musculoskeletal Injuries The initial management of musculoskeletal injuries remains the same, i.e. following the assessment and action approach of Airway, Breathing, Circulation and Disability. The management is based on the detection of life threatening injuries as per NELS protocol. The primary end point during the management is optimization and maintenance of physiology and anatomy. assessment A simple and quick way of assessment of musculoskeletal injuries involves \"Look, Listen and Feel\" approach. Take standard precautions. Use the ABCDE approach and ensure oxygenation, obtain vascular access, administer IV fluids, get blood grouping and cross-matching of blood. Enquire about the mechanism of injury, the time taken to reach the hospital and prehospital status. Look for swelling, open wound, bruises, laceration, blood loss, any deformity of limb, the colour of the limb which will be pale if there is a vascular compromise, the position of the limb (radial nerve injury causing wrist drop, peroneal nerve injury causing foot drop) and inability to move the limb. Listen to complaints of pain, paraesthesia, and numbness or inability to move a limb. Perform Doppler to assess pulse and ankle/brachial systolic pressure ratio (N<0.9) and auscultate for bruit. Feel for temperature, tenderness, swelling, and any crepitus. Palpate muscles for tension, pain on a passive stretch to rule out compartment syndrome. Check any asymmetry, distal pulses bilaterally, capillary refill time, sensory or motor deficit, tendon reflexes, able to move other limbs or not, joint stability and tendon reflexes and test for any sensory and motor loss. Lesson 8: Trauma: Head, Chest , Abdomen, Pelvis 131action Hemorrhage due to musculoskeletal injury may be life-threatening and needs to be taken care. There may not be obvious external hemorrhage, but underlying extensive soft tissue injury or long bone fractures may be associated with significant blood loss. Pelvic trauma may also be associated with major blood loss in the pelvic cavity and may be missed if not assessed for pelvic complex stability. The long bone fractures require splinting and pelvic fractures require the application of pelvic binders to prevent further ongoing blood loss along with adequate fluid and blood resuscitation. The splinting helps in the realignment of the fractured bone. This reduces the blood loss, pain and prevents further injury that may occur due to the fractured ends. The open fracture should be cleaned, covered with sterile dressing, antibiotics and tetanus toxoid injection. The most important aspect of first aid is to stabilize the arm. All injuries should be splinted before the person is moved to minimize further injury unless the scene is not safe for the victim and the responder. If sensation or pulses are impaired and limb is deformed due to fracture, a trained person should straighten the limb prior to splinting. To protect the fracture site, splinting is done one joint above and below the fractured bone. Distal pulses and sensation should be checked before and after splinting frequently. If the person complains of tightness, tingling, or numbness, then remove bandages completely, and then reapply the splint. The external bleeding must be controlled with external pressure, irrespective of the type of bleeding vessels. However, in extreme situations like amputation, a tourniquet may need to be applied to control the bleeding. The time for tourniquet application should also be noted. In the case of dislocations, either it may be reduced or may be splinted in the position in which initially found and subsequently patient is transferred to a higher centre with the requisite available facility. After management of life and limb-threatening injuries, the patient should be reassessed for the presence of any occult injuries, small joints or further worsening of existing injuries. A detailed history should include mechanism of injury, pre-hospital condition, and management of the patient. The physical examination should include a detailed head to toe examination including small joints of hand s and feet. Imaging and investigations The X-ray of the limbs remains the conventional imaging for fracture detection. Recently the use of ultrasound has emerged as bedside tool for the assessment of musculoskeletal injuries. Doppler examination of the limb with suspected arterial injury helps in the detection of blood flow . Intra-compartmental pressure measurement helps in diagnosing suspected compartment syndrome. Crush injuries Trauma may lead to crush injuries of the limbs. It results from compressive forces on the limbs leading to impaired tissue perfusion and metabolism. The tissue injuries lead to the release of products from tissue damage into the circulation. This leads to acidosis, hyperkalaemia and at times renal dysfunction, especially with the release of myoglobulin in the circulation by muscle damage. This is the predominant cause of post-traumatic renal failure and also Disseminated Intravascular Coagulopathy (DIC). Crush injuries should be managed on priority, once life-threatening injuries have been managed. Apart from wound care, crush injuries should be attended by fluid resuscitation to flush the kidneys. The use of diuretics to maintain high urine output at least more than 2ml/kg/hr is warranted. Compartment syndrome Compartment syndrome occurs after trauma when the pressure increases in the osteofascial compartment of a limb leading to compromised perfusion to the muscle. This is seen in areas having closed fascial space. This is usually seen with tibia or forearm fractures, tight plaster cast, crush injuries, reperfusion injuries, Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 132 , Abdomen, Pelvis , Musculoskeletal, Spine and Burnburns etc. The usual features include disproportionate pain in the affected limb, asymmetry of limbs, tense and tender limb, pain on passive stretching, the presence of paraesthesia and intra-compartment pressure of > 35-45 mmHg. The absence of a pulse is an important finding but is usually very late and thus the presence of a pulse may not rule out the occurrence of compartment syndrome. If not appropriately managed, this may lead to the neurological deficit, muscle necrosis, ischemic contracture, infection, delayed healing of a fracture and possible amputation. The management includes removal of tight dressings or casts and reassessment. If symptoms and signs persist, fasciotomy is required to release the pressure. Pain management The patients with musculoskeletal injuries have severe pain and require immediate treatment. Though the management like splinting and thus movement reduction may itself reduce pain, but any residual pain requires analgesic administration. Multimodal management approach for pain management is an acceptable approach for patient comfort and deleterious effects of pain. The use of narcotics in titrated and controlled administration is very effective in pain management, use it with caution keeping in mind its sedative and respiratory depression effects. The Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) are helpful for reducing inflammatory pain. However, these may be cautiously used in bleeding patients. The sedation should be used very cautiously as it may hamper reassessment. The use of interventional nerve blocks in expert hands are well-accepted pain management tool. The continued pain management require pain assessment using appropriate tools like visual analog scale or numerical rating scale. SCENaRIOS Scenario 1 A 20 year young man was hit by a motorcycle while crossing the road. He complained of severe pain in the left thigh and there was an obvious deformity. He was brought to the emergency by his friends. How did you approach? assessment In the above scenario, the injured patient complained of severe pain and had tenderness, open wound, deformity of left mid-thigh and there was no neurovascular deficit. Fracture of left mid femur was suspected. action The ABCDE approach was followed and life-threatening injuries were treated first. Watch, rings and all constricting devices were removed from the limbs. Open wounds were cleaned and covered with a sterile dressing. Taking all precautions, left limb was immobilized with Thomas Splint for temporary management. Longitudinal traction to align left limb was applied. Neurovascular status was checked before and after splinting. Analgesics, tetanus prophylaxis and antibiotics for an open wound were administered. The neurovascular deficit was checked, there was no neurovascular deficit. However, if neurovascular deficit is present, then splint should be removed and limb re-positioned and recheck. Scenario 2 While a para-dropping, 25 year boy, your companion, had a bad fall and there was severe pain in his left lower leg. You and your friend were alone in a jungle. How did you help your friend? assessment and action After reassuring the friend, his distal pulse was checked and was found to be present. A make shift splint of hard sticks from a tree was wrapped, this was kept on the inner and the outer side of the injured lower leg from Lesson 8: Trauma: Head, Chest , Abdomen, Pelvis , Musculoskeletal, Spine and Burn 133above the knee joint to below the ankle joint. This helped to reduce the pain and it also helped in taking care so that no further harm was done. This splint was also helpful during transport. Scenario 3 During a rioting, a 20 year boy got a gunshot on his left upper arm. The wound was bleeding profusely. He felt weak and numb in the arm. How did you assess and manage? assessment and action As vascular injury was suspected, there was a complaint of pain, the presence of bilateral pulse discrepancy, pallor, paraesthesia, paralysis, and cold limb. For hemorrhage control, pressure dressing was applied. Swath and sling were applied to immobilize arm, Doppler study was done to look for blood flow. It was found to be compromised, he was referred and transported for urgent surgical intervention. Scenario 4 In a 30 year man with a fracture tibia, a plaster cast was applied. He complained of severe pain after 8 hours. What happened? assessment and action Compartment syndrome was suspected due to disproportionate pain, pain on passive stretch, tense muscles, asymmetry, and altered sensations. Pulse was also weak. As there was clinical suspicion of compartment syndrome, immediately cast was removed and compartment pressure was checked, delta P <30 mmHg [diastolic pressure-compartment pressure] Compartment pressure was > 35-45 mmHg which is high. As there was no improvement in 30 minutes, fasciotomy was done to save the limb. Scenario 5 After a thunderstorm, a wall collapsed on a 28 year male sleeping on the floor. He was brought to the ED at midnight. How was he managed? assessment and action It was observed that his left leg was swollen, deformed and the patient had intense pain. His initial assessment of vitals included the blood pressure as 130/76 mmHg, heart rate 118 beats/min, and respiratory rate 26 breaths/min. Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15. His initial management as per NELS approach of the ABCDE assessment and management revealed no life-threatening abnormality. He was found to have severe pain. His distal pulses of all the four limbs were palpable. He could move his toes on verbal command. His sensory perception in all the limbs was intact. Radiographic imaging (X-ray) of left lower limb revealed commuted fracture of the femur. His cervical X-ray was normal. His left lower limb was splinted with Thomas splint and distal pulse was re-checked. He was provided with analgesics and injection tetanus toxoid and subsequently transferred to the higher center for further management. Conclusion The musculoskeletal injuries are associated injuries in poly-trauma patients. These patients require management of life-threatening injuries as per NELS concept and musculoskeletal injuries need to be assessed and managed. The clinician should be suspicious of vascular injuries, crush injuries and compartment syndrome which are limb threatening and require immediate action.Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t , , Musculoskeletal, Spine and BurnSPINE TRauma a Nd SaFE TRaNSPORT Core Concepts Anticipate and suspect spine trauma in all trauma patients. v Follow the principle of PROTECTION BEFORE DETECTION and restrict the movement of the v WHOLE spine to prevent further damage to the spinal cord. Manage Airway, Breathing, and Circulation which will prevent secondary injury to spinal cord due to v hypoxia and hypotension. Once resuscitation is complete, neurological and radiological examination is done to detect spine v trauma.If definitive treatment is unavailable in the hospital then arrange for transfer while maintaining ABC v and restricting the spinal movement. Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) causes intense and dreadful functional, psychological, economic and social disability in the patient and has long-term impact on the family and society. Most common cause of spinal injury is fall from height (unprotected roof, trees, and wells). Motor vehicle accidents are the second most common cause. Other causes include sports injury (diving, wrestling, gymnastics etc,), heavy weight falling on the head, direct trauma (blunt or penetrating) to the spine. The spinal injury should be suspected in all head injury patients. The spinal cord protection should begin at the scene of the injury with proper immobilization of the spine. However detailed neurological and radiographic evaluation is done after stabilization of the ABC. Neuroanatomy and Neurophysiology Bony vertebral column consists of 33 vertebrae (7 Cervical, 12 Thoracic, 5 Lumbar, 5 Sacral, v 4 Coccygeal) The spinal cord extends from medulla oblongata to first Lumber Vertebra. v The spinal cord has a complex network of neurons that functions along with the rest of the CNS, to v achieve control of sensory, autonomic and motor functions.There are 31 pairs of spinal nerves (8 Cervical, 12 Thoracic, 5 Lumbar, 5 Sacral, 1 v Coccygeal) The sympathetic system is localized in the thoracic and lumbar part whereas the parasympathetic v ganglia are located in the sacral region of the spinal cord.The spinal cord has three main tracts. Lateral Spinothalamic tract (transmits contralateral pain and v temperature), Corticospinal tract (Ipsilateral Motor power), Dorsal column (Ipsilateral proprioception, vibration sense and light touch). Any injury to these can easily be assessed clinically. The cervical spine is most susceptible to injury because it is most mobile and unprotected. v The thoracolumbar junction is the next part to be commonly injured because of excessive mobility at v 12th thoracic and first Lumber junction.Spinal cord segmental levels are denoted by the spinal nerve roots innervating them but are not situated v at the corresponding vertebral levels. For example, the C8 cord segment is situated in the C7 vertebra while the T12 cord is situated in the T8 vertebra. The lumbar cord is situated between T9 and T11 vertebrae. The sacral cord is situated between the T12 to L1 vertebrae. A myotome is the group of muscles that a single spinal nerve innervates. v A dermatome is an area of skin that a single spinal nerve innervates. v Pathophysiology of Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) primary injury to the spinal cord is a result of direct biomechanical injury to the neural components of the spinal cord. Secondary injury is a damage due to vascular and biochemical effects of the primary injury. Systemic factors like hypoxia and hypotension and local factors like tissue oedema contribute to the development of secondary Lesson 8: Trauma: Head, Chest , Abdomen, Pelvis , Musculoskeletal, Spine and Burn 135injury. It develops in the hours and days after primary injury. Lack of oxygen supply due to impaired perfusion at the cellular level is the main pathological process underlying all of these mechanisms, leading to ischemia and eventually tissue death. Effect of Spinal Cord Injury Respiratory system: The level of injury is an important determinant of effect on the respiratory system. The higher the level, more is the level of insufficiency. The cervical and thoracic spine injury cause respiratory embarrassment: Higher injury (C3, C4) may paralyze the phrenic nerve. v Lower Cervical injury (C5-C8) and lower level will paralyze the accessory muscles of respiration and v muscles of upper and lower limb. Higher thoracic (T1-T6) will paralyze the intercostals. v Lower thoracic (T7-T12) and below will paralyze the intercostals, abdominal musculature and lower v limb with involvement of bladder and bowel sphincters.Hypoventilation and inability to cough, lead to complications such as aspiration, hypostatic pneumonia, v atelectasis and even death. Cardiovascular system Higher spinal lesions i.e., above T5, cause interruption of descendent sympathetic pathways resulting v in unopposed parasympathetic activity.Vasodilatation and parasympathetic stimulation cause a decrease in cardiac output and total peripheral v resistance, while central venous pressure remains unchanged.The patient develops bradycardia and hypotension. v The vasodilatation and muscle paralysis contribute to the development of hypothermia. v Neurogenic shock Injury above T6 results in sudden disruption of the sympathetic outflow. This causes decreased systemic vascular resistance (vasodilatation) and bradycardia (un-opposed parasympathetic stimulation) leading to hypotension. This is called neurogenic shock and is treated by vasopressors, chronotropes, and inotropes. Spinal shock It is state of reversible loss of sensory, motor and reflex functions of the spinal cord following trauma. The recovery from this is gradual and over a variable period of time. The 'Shock' of spinal shock is not a haemodynamic phenomenon. Classification of Spinal Cord Injury Complete: v No demonstrable sensory or motor function below the level of lesion. (Caution: In the setting of acute spinal shock, it is difficult to comment on complete or incomplete injury). Incomplete: v Some evidence of motor or sensory function remains below the level of lesion. Prognosis is significantly better for recovery for an incomplete injury. management of Spine Trauma Management of Spine trauma has three components: Prehospital, In-hospital, and Transfer to an appropriate facility. Pre hospital management PROTECT BEFORE DETECT! Anticipate and suspect Cervical spine trauma in all patients. v The pre-hospital management of a spine trauma patient follows the principle of whole spine v immobilization, management of the ABC and immediate transfer to the hospital.Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t , Abdomen, Pelvis , Musculoskeletal, Spine and BurnPre-hospital personnel needs to use the following devices to restrict the spinal movement: v Semi-rigid cervical collar \u0090 Supportive blocks on the side \u0090 Spine board with straps \u0090 In-hospital management The priority of management remains the same i.e., stabilization of the ABC, along with restriction of the spinal movement. 1. Airway management with restriction of spinal movement Spine trauma rarely causes airway compromise as a result of the spinal injury. However, immobilization devices, in patients with spine trauma, may pose difficulty in airway management. Due to this restriction in the movement of the neck, the intubation is difficult and hence the involvement of an expert early on is highly recommended. At the time of airway management, the collar should be removed and Manual In-Line Stabilization should be applied instead. Indications for endotracheal intubation in spinal cord injury are: v Acute respiratory failure. \u0090 Glasgow score < 9. \u0090 Increased respiratory rate. ml/kg body weight. \u0090 2. Breathing: Positive pressure ventilation should be initiated to manage breathing; periodically measuring respiratory parameters. 3. Management of circulation: Circulatory compromise in acute spinal cord injury may be hemorrhagic and/or neurogenic. v Hypotension, in spinal cord injured patients, may be because of a high incidence of associated injuries. v These signs of hypovolemia are also mimicked by spinal shock. This leads to confusing vital signs. Hence, an active search for occult sources of hemorrhage must be made. After occult sources of hemorrhage have been excluded, judicious fluid replacement with an isotonic v crystalloid solution to a maximum of 1L is the initial treatment of choice. Overzealous crystalloid administration may precipitate pulmonary edema. Vasopressors may be used if a haemorrhagic shock is ruled out: v Dopamine or Nor-epinephrine is required rarely for ionotropic support. \u0090 Prevent hypothermia (infuse warm fluids, cover the patient, keep high ambient temperature). \u0090 The following parameters form the therapeutic goals for adequate perfusion for the treatment of v neurogenic shock: Systolic Blood Pressure (BP) of 90-100 mmHg. \u0090 Heart rate should be 60-100 beats per minute (bpm) in normal sinus rhythm. \u0090 Treat bradycardia associated with hypotension with atropine. \u0090 Placement of a Foley catheter is required to monitor urine output(>30ml/hr) and to decompress \u0090 Spine and Burn 137Clinical Pearls Full spinal movement restriction should be maintained till spinal injury is ruled out by an \u0083 expert. Once the patient is on a firm trolley, the spine board should be removed. Prolonged use \u0083 of spine boards (>2 hrs) can lead to pressure injuries. A baseline skin assessment should always be performed on the removal of the backboard. Neurological assessment and management Spine trauma should be suspected in all patients who are intoxicated (drugs or alcohol), unconscious, have a distracting injury, are confused and uncooperative.

Radiographic examination It is not recommended in patients who are awake, alert, not intoxicated and are without neck pain or v tenderness on a full range of movement. The patient should not have any significant associated injuries that distract them at the time of v evaluation. Such patients may be cleared of cervical spine trauma with instructions to report if they have pain, tenderness, paraesthesia, numbness or any other sign of neurological injury. Radiographic evaluation involves X-ray of Cervical Spine Lateral, AP and Odontoid view. v Supplement with CT Scan or MRI of suspicious areas. v 6. Neurologic deterioration Despite optimal treatment, the neurologic deficit of Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) often increases during v the hours to days following acute injury.The extension of the sensory deficit cephalad to the initially detected neurologic level is one of the first v signs of neurologic deterioration. Careful repeat neurologic examination may help in detecting the rise in sensory level by 1 or 2 v segments. Repeat neurologic examinations to check for progression are mandatory and should always be v documented. Transfer to Secondary units Patients may require transfer to a higher center for definitive treatment of spine trauma or other injuries once the ABC are stabilized. The transfer should not be delayed for un-necessary diagnostic tests and procedures that will not alter initial management. This includes radiological imaging of the spine. The movement of the whole spine should be restricted during the transfer to prevent secondary injury. The log-roll is the standard procedure to allow examination of the back; to allow placement of X-ray plates and for transfer on and off spine board. The number of rolls should be kept to an absolute minimum. SCENaRIOS Scenario 1: Isolated spinal injury A boy dives from a height into shallow water, hitting his head first at the base of the swimming pool, unable to move all four limbs. He is rescued by the lifeguard. Assessment: The NELS approach (Assess and Manage) applied to this patient would be the following: Airway: v Talked to the patient. He is talking, his airway is clear. Applied semi-rigid cervical collar, placed him on a long spine board with supportive blocks and strapped him on the board to immobilize the whole spine. Given oxygen by high flow oxygen by mask. Breathing: v Assessed his breathing. Only abdominal breathing is present, it is jerky because of ? high spinal injury causing paralysis of resiratory muscles. Kept watch on his oxygen saturation and end tidal CO2. When tidal volume became inadequate, intubated the trachea with a limitation of spinal movement v and assisted his ventilation. Circulation: v BP is 70/40 mmHg, Pulse is 60/min and has cold extremities. Hypotension and bradycardia indicate sympathetic block due to spinal cord injury. Inserted two wide v bore I/V cannula. Infused 1L of warm Ringer Lactate. No response was seen so started vasopressor infusion. Disability: v Patient was alert, talking, following commands, GCS is 15, pupils are normal so he may not have a head injury. There is a loss of sensation and movement in the upper and lower limbs.Lesson 8: Trauma: Head, Chest , Abdomen, Pelvis , and Burn 139Performed FAST to rule out occult injury as the patient may not have symptoms (pain abdomen) due v to a sensory loss which was negative. Once the ABC were stable, did a detailed neurological examination for sensory and motor functions. v Got X-ray of C-spine AP and Lateral films, only when the patient was stable and time permitted before transfer for the definitive care. Restrict the movement of the whole spine. v As the facility for definitive treatment is not available, arranged for transfer to a higher centre while v maintaining the ABC with restriction of spinal movement. Scenario 2: Polytrauma with spinal injury A car driver without seat belt sustains multiple injuries over his face and torso when his car has a head-on collision and brought to the ED. The NELS approach (Assess and Manage) to this patient would be the following: Airway: v Assessed the airway with cervical spine immobilization. Used OPA as airway was obstructed. Facial injuries caused blood in the airway, cleared with suction, trachea intubated as the bleeding was continuous, keeping a low threshold for the surgical airway. Once a definitive airway was established, gave oxygen by high flow mask. Breathing: v Assessed breathing. The possibility of pneumothorax, haemothorax, fracture ribs with flail chest was kept in mind. Managed as per the findings and optimized the ventilation.Circulation: v Assessed circulation. Looked for signs of haemorrhagic shock. Looked for the site of bleeding by clinical examination and FAST. BP is 70/40, Pulse is 140/min. Treated with warm isotonic crystalloid and blood products as per protocol. Disability: v Assessed GCS, pupils and looked for obvious lateralizing signs. Complains of back pain hints towards the possibility of spinal injury. Restrict the movement of the whole spine.Maintain high suspicion as masking of spinal injury due to distracting injuries or masking of other v injuries due to spinal injuries is common in polytrauma patients. Once the ABC, are stable, did a detailed neurological examination for sensory and motor functions. v Since the patient is not responding, the sensory examination is not possible. Got X-ray of C-spine AP and Lateral films, when the patient was stable and time permitted before transfer for definitive care. Kept the whole spine immobilized. v As the facility for definitive treatment is not available, arranged to transfer to a higher centre while v maintaining the ABC with the whole spine immobilization. Scenario 3: Exclusion of spinal injury A nursing student slips on the staircase of a nursing hostel and has a fall. His paramedic friends apply a cervical collar and shift him to the hospital on a spine board after properly restricting spinal movements. Airway & Breathing: v The patient is talking comfortably and responding to verbal commands. A & B are stable. Circulation: v P- 96/min; BP- 118/78 mmHg. C is stable. Disability: v Conscious, moving all the four limbs. Complains of pain in the right wrist. Patient already has the restriction of spinal movement device in place. v Spinal injury needs to be excluded before the restrictions in place are removed. v The patient is conscious, cooperative, alert, able to focus attention on neck and spine, not intoxicated, v has no distracting injuries (only a minor wrist injury).Rule out neck or spine pain, bony tenderness on palpation, any bruising, step down deformity, a v neurological deficit.Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t , Abdomen, Pelvis , Musculoskeletal, Spine and BurnAssess to rule out pain, tenderness or tingling with gentle voluntary movement (side to side; flexion- v extension). Before eliciting this step, the patient needs to be explained clearly; stressing on the need to be very soft and cautious with the movements and to stop at the slightest suspicion of the above symptoms. Cervical collar and long spine board can be removed if the above criteria are met. v Further evaluation or X-ray is not required. v The patient needs to be directed to follow up at the onset of the slightest of symptoms. v buRN INjuR y Core Concepts Airway, breathing, and circulation are the priority in the assessment and management of Thermal v Injury. One must clinically suspect inhalational injury and treat by securing the airway and improving v oxygenation at the earliest.Chemical and electrical burns need special care. v First aid Contact with a source of heat, i.e. fire or hot liquid should be stopped. Fire should be doused with v water, drop and roll, covering with a blanket. Stop contact with hot liquid and pour water on the scalded area to cool down. Remove clothes and jewellery from the burnt area. Wash with cold water till pain subsides. It may take 10-15 minutes. Ice should be avoided. The wound should be covered with clean cloth and transported to specialised centre. Water by mouth should be encouraged till patient reaches a hospital. v Paracetamol should be given for pain management. v Blister if any should be left intact. v Avoid application of toothpaste, mud, cow dunk, oil, ghee or unsterile ointment or powder. If available v antibiotic ointment may be applied. Shift burn victim to a hospital for appropriate care in the following circumstances Almost all the burn patients except for very small superficial burn should be taken to a specialised burn centre. No burn patient should be ignored. Shift burn victims to hospital expeditiously in the following circumstances: Facial burn with an inhalational injury. v Burn in closed space with likely hood of Carbon Monoxide poisoning. v Full thickness burns anywhere in the body. v Chemical and electrical injury. v Multiple injuries, signs include cold, clammy skin, sweating, rapid, shallow breathing, and weakness v or dizziness impending signs of shock. Pregnant women. v Children < 5 years or elderly >60 years of age. v Suffering from comorbidity. v Immune deficiency due to HIV or AIDS, on chemotherapy. v All burn victims should be given tetanus toxoid prophylaxis (Tetanus toxoid and Human Tetanus Abdomen, Pelvis , Musculoskeletal, Spine and Burn 141assessment of burn victim Apart from the general condition of the patient, following important parameters are assessed which are relevant for the management: 1. Degree of burn 2. Body surface Percentage of burn 3. Weight of the patient degree of burn Epidermal burn (1st degree). The only epidermis is burnt. Skin is red and tender with no blisters. Does v not require calculation of burn area and IV fluids. Treated with topical creams and emollients. Partial-thickness burn (2nd degree). Involves the epidermis and part of the dermis, looks wet and v weepy, edematous, usually have blisters. It is painful due to the exposed nerve endings. Requires aggressive management to avoid morbidity and mortality. This is again divided into superficial partial thickness and deep partial thickness depending upon the involvement of dermal thickness. Full-thickness burn (3rd degree). The burn of epidermis and the full thickness of dermis. It may also v involve deeper tissues e.g. fascia, fat, muscles or even bones. There are no blisters, looks dry, leathery and insensitive. Mortality and morbidity are very high. body Surface Percentage of burn Only second and third degree burns are calculated. Mostly there is a mixture of all the degrees of burns v in one victim. Rule of NINE is used in adults. It is used to calculate % of total body surface burn area for calculation v of fluid therapy. Here body areas are divided into different regions equal to 9 or multiples of 9. The smaller burnt area is measured by considering the palmer surface of the patient including fingers to be considered as 1% of body surface area of the victim.

The second person opens/cuts the straps v and opens the visor.If Visor is stuck, the screws should be v removed to take out the visor.Now, from foot end, the second person v applies in-line immobilization. One hand is placed on the angle of the mandible with the thumb on one side and fingers on the other side. The other hand is kept at the occiput to minimize any neck movement. The first person, who is standing at the head end, should now stretch and expand the helmet laterally v on the two sides to remove pressure from ears and clear them.Subsequently, the first person continues to remove the helmet by forward and backward motion, taking v care to avoid injury to the nose.After helmet removal, in-line immobilization is maintained from the head end and then the cervical v collar is applied. Clinical Pearl Always ask for symptoms of pain, numbness, and paresthesia. If patient complains of any \u0083 of these symptoms, abandon the above-mentioned technique. The helmet should then be removed by cutting. To assess glasgow Coma Scale (gCS) Glasgow Coma Scale is a universal scoring system to assess neurological status of the brain of the patient, including the level of consciousness and the potential of hypoxia, for prognosis and follow up and is recorded at regular intervals to assess the response of the patient to the treatment being administered. A confused, belligerent, combative or uncooperative patient is hypoxic until proved otherwise. A decreased level of consciousness (GCS,15/15) indicates the following probable causes: Decreased cerebral oxygenation (caused by hypoxia/hypoperfusion). v Central Nervous System (CNS) injury. v Drug or alcohol abuse. v Metabolic derangement (diabetes, seizure, cardiac arrest). v The GCS is a quick simple tool for determining cerebral function and is predictive of patient outcome, especially the best motor response. The GCS has three components as given below. The patient is assigned a score according to the best response to each component of Eye opening Verbal and Motor (EVM) as follows:1. Eye opening response Spontaneous 4 v To voice/speech 3 v Figure 9.1: Helmet RemovalLesson 9: Skills :Managing Trauma Vic tim 147To pain 2 v None 1 v 2. Verbal response Oriented & converses 5 v Confused but converses 4 v Inappropriate words 3 v Inappropriate sounds 2 v None 1 v 3. Motor response Obeys commands 6 v Localizes pain 5 v Withdraws to pain 4 v Flexes to pain (decorticate) 3 v Extends to pain (decerebrate) 2 v None 1 v If the patient opens eyes spontaneously, he/she is given a score of 4, even if can open only one eye, as it is the best response that we assess. If the patient does not open eyes spontaneously, the patient is asked to open his eyes by the person assessing or opening eyes to verbal command which is given a score of 3. If the patient does not respond to a verbal stimulus, a painful stimulus such as nail bed pressure with a pen, squeezing the axillary tissue, supraorbital nerve pressure or sternal pressure can be applied. The patient's verbal response is assessed using questions like \"what happened to you?\" If the patient answers correctly and coherently he scores 5, otherwise the patient may be confused (talking in sentences but disoriented in time and place), inappropriate (utters occasional words rather than sentences), unintelligible (groans or grunts but no words) or absent responses, which gets him a score of 4,3,2 and 1 respectively. The third but most important component of the GCS is the motor score. A simple command is given to the patient such as \"hold up two fingers\". If the patient complies, the highest score of 6 is given. If the patient does not follow commands, a painful stimulus is given to the patient and his motor response observed. A patient who pushes away the hand giving the painful stimulus, is considered to be \"localizing and scores 5\"; if he withdraws from pain he scores 4, if there is abnormal flexion (decorticate posturing) or extension (decerebrate posturing) of the upper extremities, or complete absence of motor function, the patient scores 3,2 and 1 respectively. The maximum GCS score is 15/15 and indicates that the patient has no disability at that time, whereas the lowest score of 3/15 generally indicates very poor prognosis and is an ominous sign. The GCS score also determines the severity of neurological disability, where GCS of 13 to 15 implies a minor injury. Score between 9 to 12 indicates a moderate injury and a GCS less than 8 indicates severe neurological disability and is an indication for securing a definitive airway, i.e. a cuffed endotracheal tube in the trachea, secured and connected to an oxygen source. Examination of Pupils Bring torchlight from the corner of the eye toward the pupil and see reaction and size of pupils on both sides. Check the size and reaction. Size can be normal, semi dilated or completely dilated. Reaction to light can be normal, brisk constriction, constricted or pinpoint, sluggish reaction or no reaction to light. basics of Computerised Tomography (CT) head Scan CT scan is the most important tool to diagnose a head injury. A non-contrast CT head is undertaken in Head injury in emergency department. The patient should always be resuscitated adequately and should be Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 148 Lesson 9: Skills :Managing Trauma Vic timhemodynamically stable before CT scan is done. If a patient requires transfer to a higher centre for expert management, then do not delay the transfer of these patients for doing CT scan. A neurosurgeon or radiologist should be consulted for expert and detailed interpretation of CT scan. how to read it? Confirm that the CT scan is of the correct patient. v It should be a non-contrast CT scan. v Always correlate the clinical findings with that of a CT findings. v Start reading from outside to inside structures i.e. scalp, skull, meninges, brain. v Air and CSF are seen as black whereas blood and bone are seen as white of varying intensities. v Look for swelling, laceration of the scalp. v Look for skull fractures, although they are best appreciated in 'Bone Window' of CT scan. v Extradural hematoma v is seen as a biconvex or lenticular shaped area of increased density on the inner surface of skull. It is commonly located in the Temporal or Temporoparietal region. It is also associated with compression of underlying sulci and gyri. Large hematomas may also cause midline shift. Acute Subdural hematoma v is seen as increased density along the cerebral hemisphere. The compression of sulci and gyri are seen. It may be associated with mid line shift and intracerebral contusion and hematoma. Cerebral contusion v is seen as punctate areas of high density inside the cerebral hemisphere. Intracerebral hematoma v is seen as an area of high density inside the cerebral hemisphere. Examine the ventricles for their size and symmetry. Any distortion of size or shift from midline should v be noted. Increased density in the ventricles is suggestive of Intraventricular Bleed. Look for v Midline Shift. The midline is a line drawn from Crista Galli anteriorly to Inion posteriorly, which is a tent like projection. A shift from midline is estimated by assessing the shift of the septum pellucidum, which is situated between the two lateral ventricles, from that of the midline. A shift of 5 mm or more is considered significant and requires neurosurgical intervention. Look for fracture of facial bones, sinuses and air-fluid levels in mastoid air cells and sinuses. This may v suggest the presence of basilar skull fracture. ChEST INjuR y Pericardiocentesis Pericardiocentesis is a life-saving procedure performed for a patient of cardiac tamponade in obstructive shock. Blood or fluid collection in the fibrous pericardial sac prevents the heart from contracting effectively, leading to a decreased cardiac output and shock. Urgent intervention for emptying the pericardial sac is necessary for restoring adequate cardiac function as soon as possible followed by a definitive surgical repair. position: The patient should be placed in a supine position with the head end of the bed raised to a 45 to 60-degree angle. This position helps in bringing the heart closer to the chest wall for easier insertion of the pericardiocentesis needle into the pericardial sac for aspiration of blood. Figure 9.2: PericardiocentesisLesson 9: Skills :Managing Trauma Vic tim 149Site: The procedure is done using ultrasound guidance and under ECG monitoring through the subxiphoid approach. Use of ultrasound helps in accurate placement of the aspiration needle while ECG monitoring helps in early detection of complications like intramyocardial needle placement leading to cardiac arrhythmias. Procedure Monitor SpO v2, Blood Pressure, ECG. Under all aseptic precautions, administer local anaesthesia at the puncture site. v Attach a 50 ml syringe and a three way stopcock to a 16-18 G 15 cm/6 inches long over the needle v catheter. Under ECG monitoring and preferably using an ultrasound machine, insert this over the needle v catheter between the xiphoid process and the left costal margin,1-2 cm below and to the left of the xiphochondrial junction, at a 30-45-degree angle, aiming for the tip of the left scapula. Withdraw as much of blood as can be aspirated. After aspiration is complete, remove the syringe, close the three way stopcock and fix the catheter v in-situ with a suture for further aspiration of blood from the pericardial sac if required. Reassess vital parameters of the patient. Seek expert consultation of a cardiothoracic surgeon. v Shift the patient to the operation theatre for definitive treatment by a cardiothoracic sur geon. v Complications Bleeding v Arrhythmias including Ventricular Fibrillation. v Pneumothorax v Aspiration of blood from the ventricles instead of the pericardial sac. v Damage to epicardium or myocardium by the needle. v Puncture of esophagus or peritoneum. v Needle Thoracocentesis/Needle thoracotomy Needle thoracotomy is a life-saving skill used in suspected or confirmed tension pneumothorax with signs of obstructive shock. Air under tension in the pleural space causes compression and collapse of the ipsilateral lung, shifting of mediastinum and great vessels to the opposite side, leading to a decreased venous return and obstructive shock. This air under pressure needs to be released immediately which is done by this technique of needle thoracocentesis which is a temporising measure and must be followed by intercostal drain insertion. Equipment Skin-cleansing agent, 14-16 gauge, 5 or 8 cm over-the-needle catheter, a 10 ml syringe. landmarks In adults: Fourth or fifth intercostal space anterior to the mid axillary line. In child: Second intercostal space at the midclavicular line. Position The patient should be placed in a head up position of 45 to 60 degrees, if feasible and not contraindicated.Figure 9.3: Needle Thoracocentesis Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 150 Lesson 9: Skills :Managing Trauma Vic timProcedure Administer 100% oxygen by face mask. The patient is asked to lie still and the area is cleaned with an v iodine based solution preferably. Insert a large-bore over the needle catheter, 5-8 cm in length attached with a luer lock 10 ml syringe v containing 2 ml normal saline, in the selected land mark. A long needle, 5-8 cm in length is used, held perpendicular to the chest wall when inserting for better v results. Insert the needle just above the cephalad border of the rib because the intercostal vessels (neurovascular bundle) are on the lower edge of the rib and puncture the parietal pleura. While advancing the needle keep on aspirating as the needle enters the pleural space, when bubbling v of air is seen, remove the syringe. A hissing sound of air escaping will be heard.Remove the needle leaving the catheter in place. Secure the catheter in place and prepare the patient v for tube thoracotomy.Reassess the patient's vital parameters. v Contraindications There are no contraindications for needle thoracotomy because tension pneumothorax is a life threatening condition, and failure to treat can result in death of the patient, hence if in doubt, it is better to treat. Complications may occur, more so in patients with a history of previous thoracotomy, previous pneumonectomy, the presence of a coagulation disorder or wrong diagnosis. Complications Pneumothorax can occur following needle thoracocentesis. v Haemothorax v Laceration of the lung v Infection v Local hematoma v Negative tap v Cough v Pain v Chest Tube drainage Equipment Thoracotomy kits, sterile drapes chest tube (28-32 F), traumatic pneumothoraces, haemothoraces and empyemas will need placement of large bore intercostal drains, and under water seal. Make sure that all the instruments required to insert a chest tube are available before commencing the procedure. Preparation Supplemental oxygen and monitoring should be instituted. The site selected is cleaned with an antiseptic solution with full aseptic precautions. The site is covered with sterile drapes, except the insertion site which is kept exposed. The insertion site is then injected with local anaesthetic. Position In cases of trauma, emergency chest tube placement is usually performed in supine position as part of the primary survey; however it is preferable to place the patient in a 45 degree head up position if there are no contraindications. Ipsilateral arm should be extended overhead and flexed at the elbow . Site Site for chest tube insertion is chosen at the level of the nipple, just in front of the mid-axillary line on the involved side. This corresponds to the 5th intercostal space. This area lies within \"triangle of safety\", which Lesson 9: Skills :Managing Trauma Vic tim 151is bounded anteriorly by lateral border of the pectoralis major, posteriorly by the anterior border of latissimus dorsi, base being a horizontal line at the level of nipple and the apex is below the axilla. Procedure Clean and drape the site determined for insertion of the v Intercostal D rain (ICD). Administer local anaesthetic agent subcutaneously and till the rib periosteum. v The skin is incised transversely for 2-3 cm and with the help of an artery forceps the subcutaneous v tissue is bluntly dissected. The intercostal muscles are split at the upper border of lower rib, to prevent damage to the neurovascular v bundle.Tip of a closed large artery forceps is used to puncture the parietal pleura after which a gloved finger v is inserted inside the incision to clear adhesions and palpate the parietal pleura.The proximal end of the chest tube of appropriate size (32 French gauge in an adult) is held with an v artery forceps and inserted into the pleural cavity, directing it posteriorly along the inner side of the chest wall. Significant force should never be applied, as this carries a risk of damage to the essential intra-thoracic v and intra-abdominal structures such as Lung, heart, liver and spleen.Once the chest drain is in proper place with all holes inside the skin, then it is connected to the underwater v seal. This underwater seal will act as one-way valve, which will allow egress of intrapleural air whereas the atmospheric air will be prevented from entering into the pleural cavity during inspiration. Look for fogging of the chest tube during expiration. v The chest tube is fixed with a purse string suture at the site of the incision. The ends of the suture are v left loose so that they can be tied when the chest tube is removed.The chest-drain connection is secured with a tape and an occlusive dressing is applied and the tube is v taped to the chest wall.Make sure that the drainage tube is underwater for at least 2 cm in the collection bag. This will ensure v a proper seal.ONE SHOULD NOT RAISE THE CHAMBER above the level of the heart to prevent reverse flow of v fluid from the collection bag to the pleural cavity.Under no circumstances, the tip of the drainage tube is permitted to slip out of water otherwise v atmospheric air will enter pleural cavity causing pulmonary collapse. Obtain a check post-procedure chest X-ray. v Reassess the patient and obtain an ABG and pulse oximetry readings. v Complications Surgical emphysema. v Figure 9.1: Chest tube drainageProvider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 152 Lesson 9: Skills :Managing Trauma Vic timInjury to intra thoracic or intra abdominal structures (this can be prevented by placing the gloved v finger in the incision site before placing the chest tube). Bleeding v Nerve injury. v Blockage/kinking/not functional due to drain holes outside the pleural cavity. v Problem of the drainage system. v Pleural infection. v Intercostal neuritis/neuralgia. v Reading x-ray Chest Film general points Confirm that the X-ray film being viewed is of the correct patient. v Always interpret the X-ray in association with the clinical findings of the patient. v Further evaluation may be required as per information provided by the X-ray chest. v X-ray in the trauma patients may be possible only in A-P view due to supine position of the patient. v An ABCD approach for interpretation of chest X-ray is advocated, starting from inside to the v exterior.In X-ray, air is visualised as black and fluid as white in coloured images. v 1. Assessing the Airway: Trachea and bronchi Assess the position of the trachea: v Is it central or deviated to one side? Normally, the air in the trachea (black image) should lie over the cervical spinous processes, indicating that the trachea is central. If an endotracheal tube is seen in situ (has a radio-opaque line), its position to be assessed vis-a-vis the v carina. If the ETT is endobronchial, it needs repositioning.Assess for presence of air outside the tracheobronchial tree, interstitial or intrapleural, which v represents a breach in continuity of the airway due to injury - pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, and subcutaneous and interstitial emphysema of the neck. Disruption of the bronchus can lead to a free communication with the pleural space on the injured side, v causing a persistent pneumothorax unresponsive to tube thoracostomy. Clinically continuous air leak is seen in the underwater seal chamber. 2. Assessing the Breathing apparatus: Lung parenchyma and pleural spaces Assess the lung parenchyma of both sides for the presence of infiltrates suggestive of pulmonary v contusion, haematoma, and aspiration; also look for consolidation and collapse of lung parenchyma due to a massive collection of fluid or air in the pleural spaces. Assess the pleural space for any abnormal collection of air. Air is seen as a lucent blackish area with v no bronchial or vascular markings and is due to pneumothorax.Assess the pleural spaces on both sides for any abnormal collection of fluid, that is usually blood in a v trauma scenario. This is visualised as a whitish image with an air fluid level if the X-ray is taken in an erect position. As the critically injured patients are usually in a supine position, the fluid in the pleural space spreads over the entire pleural cavity and therefore produces a whitish discolouration of lesser density (depending on the total volume of fluid/blood) with no air fluid level demarcation. 3. Assess Circulation: Mediastinum and heart shadow Assess for the widening of the mediastinum, which is suggestive of a large vessel injury/Aortic rupture. v Air or blood in the pericardial sac leads to an enlarged cardiac shadow. v Air in the mediastinum (pneumomediastinum) can be seen in tracheobronchial injury. vLesson 9: :Managing Trauma Vic tim to the right. \u0090 Right mainstem bronchus is elevated and shifted to the right. \u0090 Left mainstem bronchus is depressed. \u0090 If an NG tube is in situ in the oesophagus, it is shifted to the right. \u0090 Fractures of the first and second ribs may be present. \u0090 4. Assess Diaphragm Evaluate both domes of the diaphragm for: v Elevation: Normal position of the right dome is higher than the left dome due to the presence of \u0090 the right lobe of the liver. Disruption (stomach, bowel gas or NG tube above the diaphragm and inside the chest cavity). \u0090 Poor identification or delineation of the domes of the diaphragm - irregular or obscure, due to \u0090 rupture or overlying structures (fluid or soft tissue mass). Diaphragmatic injury is suspected if following are seen: v Elevation, irregularity or obliteration of part or whole of the dome of the diaphragm. \u0090 Loculated pneumothorax like appearance. \u0090 Air or contrast filled stomach or bowel shadow above the diaphragm. \u0090 Mediastinal shift to the contralateral side. \u0090 Pleural effusion. \u0090 Keep a high index of suspicion of a diaphragmatic rupture based on the mechanism of injury, signs v and symptoms and X-ray findings. Sequential X-ray films and CT scan may be required to confirm the diagnosis. 5. Assess for Exteriors: Bony thorax, Soft tissues Bony thorax: v Assess the clavicles for signs of fracture and associated injuries especially those of the great \u0090 vessels. Assess the Scapulae for fractures and associated injuries of the airway, great vessels, and \u0090 pulmonary contusion.Assess ribs for fractures and associated injuries of underlying vital structures. Upper ribs (1 to 3) \u0090 fractures imply that the force/impact has been massive and injury to the underlying structures must be looked for, namely great vessels, airway, and lung. Fracture of 4-9 ribs are usually associated with an underlying injury to lung tissue. Flail chest \u0090 must be looked for too. Associated injury to upper abdominal organs must be ruled out (spleen, liver, and kidneys). 9-12 rib fractures are commonly associated with injury to the abdominal organs. \u0090 Assess sternum for any fracture or dislocation of the sternomanubrial junction. \u0090 Soft tissues v Look for the presence of subcutaneous emphysema (black air shadow), any bony fragments or \u0090 foreign bodies. 6.

Advantages are that it is rapid, non-invasive, technically easy, and inexpensive. Moreover, it is performed at the bed-side in resuscitation area, so and other diagnostic and therapeutic procedures can be undertaken simultaneously. As with other diagnostic tools, FAST also has its disadvantages/limitations. It requires operating skills (needs to be learned and mastered) and in obese patients and patients with subcutaneous emphysema, the obtained images are of poor quality. Retroperitoneal Bleeding/injuries are not well visualized, it does not identify the source of haemorrhage, hollow viscus injuries are not identified, it cannot differentiate between the type of fluid like water, body fluid, blood and urine. These all appear black (Hypo/Anechoic area). Despite all of its shortcomings/disadvantages, it is a wonderful, reliable, accurate and important adjunct in trauma. A negative FAST though does not exclude intraabdominal injury, it does make it less likely to be a source of bleeding causing a haemodynamic instability. Also, doing serial imaging, repeating FAST, at times picks up late haemorrhage or gives valuable information on progressing haemorrhage. E-FAST (Extended FAST) - In addition to the four windows examined in FAST, in E- FAST windows in Anterior Thoracic Cavity are examined to detect Pneumothorax, Haemothorax, and Pleural effusion. Indications Identification of Hypovolemic cause of hypotension-Free Intraperitoneal Fluid (considered as blood in case of trauma, unless proved otherwise) and a Non-Hypovolemic cause of Hypotension - Pericardial Tamponade. Procedure FAST includes scanning of four windows (1) Pericardial Sac (Subxiphoid view). (2) Hepatorenal Fossa/Morison's Pouch (Right Upper Quadrant View). (3) Splenorenal Fossa (Left Upper Quadrant View). (4) Pouch of Douglas (Suprapubic or Pelvic view). These are the most dependent areas of the abdominal cavity in the supine position, as, fluid accumulation starts at these places and hence, are examined to pick up any free fluid. To perform FAST, the following steps are performed: Step 1: powering on the sonography machine (using power-on/on-off button) Step 2: Select Abdomen as a region to perform the scan Step 3: Select gain gain means brightness and contrast adjustment of the screen to enable to visualize and differentiate various organs/structures appearing on the screen). Using Gain Knob, adjust gain as per your comfort. To adjust Gain, the liver is identified and visualized in subxiphoid view, it is taken as Isoechoic organ, structures appearing brighter than this are considered Hyperechoic and the ones darker than this are considered as Hypoechoic/Anechoic. Use Auto Gain: Many newer machines come with the feature of auto gain, where screen automatically adjusts its parameters to best-suited values. Step 4: Adjust depthDepth means the distance (from the foot of the probe into the body) to be visualized on the screen. In a normal adult, most structures of interest (from point of view of FAST) lie approx. at a distance of 16-18 cms from the skin surface, so the depth can be kept between 15-19 cms, (median 17 cms). Lesson 9: Skills :Managing Trauma Vic tim 155However, if the subject is obese, one might have to go higher than 19 cms (like 21-23 cms) and in case the individual is thin, one may have to go even lesser than 15 cms (like 13-11 cms). Step 5: Select low-frequency probe and check polarityLow Frequency (3-5 MHz frequency) Curvilinear Probe or Cardiac Probe is used for FAST as it has better penetration/depth and forms faster images, though these are low-resolution images. All probes have one end marked in the form of either a coloured dot like red/green/yellow or some kind of embossed mark like an Arrow or T or an LED light, which is not there on another end. By convention, the marked end of the probe remains on the right side of the patient when the probe is placed transversely (Pericardial and Suprapubic) of the probe and towards cranial (head) end, in case the probe is used craniocaudally (Right and Left upper quadrant). The activity of the marked side should be reflected on the right side of the screen. This is confirmed by tapping the finger on the marked side of the foot after smearing jelly over its foot and looking for activity on the right border of the screen or by looking at the markings on the screen as a dot or an arrow (software enabled). This is done for checking the Polarity of the probe. Step 6: Smear jelly on the foot of the probeFoot of the probe is the area that goes in contact with the patient and through which sound waves travel into the body to form various organ images. Water-based jelly is used, which is smeared in good quantity all over the foot of the probe. Jelly acts as a medium through which the sound waves travel. Improper contact of the foot with patient and use of jelly in insufficient amount produces poor quality images. Step 7: pericardial view/sub xiphoid viewThe probe is placed in sub-xiphoid area with transverse orientation, with marked side pointing towards the right of the patient and liver is identified. Once the liver is identified the probe is tilted to lie almost 20-30 degrees to the body surface, with its foot adherent to the skin of the patient. This brings 4 chambered view of the heart on the screen. The probe is directed slightly to the left, so as to bring heart to the centre of the screen. Fluid within the heart appears black and is its normal content. Look for the bright hyperechoic pericardium and grey myocardium. Look for anechoic black strip separating the two, which is the fluid present in the pericardium. In extreme cases, the heart may appear as a collapsed globular structure with none of its chambers visualizing. A thick black fluid strip appears surrounding the myocardium, separating it from the pericardium on all sides, this is cardiac tamponade. The pressure of the pericardial fluid collapses the heart and prevents the heart from beating with no filling of chambers. Sub-xiphoid view Step 8: Right upper quadrant view If possible, keep the arms of the patient above the shoulders or head level of the patient, provided it is not causing any further harm to the patient. Place the probe in craniocaudal fashion, with the marked side pointing Probe placement Normal view FAST PositiveProvider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 156 Lesson 9: Skills :Managing Trauma Vic timtowards the cranial end of the patient, in the mid-axillary line at the level of 10th-11th rib space. Tilt probe slightly posteriorly at the same place to bring diaphragm, liver and the right kidney into the view. Identify the liver, right kidney, diaphragm and the hepatorenal fossa (Morrisons Pouch). Look for black, areas in the Morison's Pouch or liver and diaphragm interface, which represent free fluid, which is blood unless proved otherwise. Right upper quadrant view Step 9: Left upper quadrant view Hold the probe with your fingers curling around the probe's handle from below. Place the probe in craniocaudal fashion, with the marked side pointing cranial end of the patient, in the mid axillary line at the level of 9th-10th rib space, which is a space or two higher than the right side. Start moving the probe towards posterior axillary line till the knuckles of the hand start to touch the bed of the patient, stop here to bring the diaphragm, spleen and left kidney into the view. Identify spleen, left kidney, diaphragm, and the splenorenal fossa. Look for black anechoic/Hypoechoic areas in the splenorenal fossa or spleen and diaphragm interface, which represent free fluid which is blood unless proved otherwise. Left upper quadrant view Step 10: Suprapubic view It is better to obtain this view prior to the placement of Foley's catheter/indwelling urinary catheter. Place the probe in a transverse orientation with the marked end of the probe pointing towards the right of the patient, in the midline just below the umbilicus. Start dragging probe below, towards the pelvis till pubic bone is felt. Just above the pubic symphysis, press the probe a little and tilt it at 45 degrees, with the foot of the probe facing caudally, as if it is looking into the pelvis. This brings urinary bladder into the view with black anechoic/hypoechoic area within it, representing fluid. Urine is the normal content of the bladder . Probe placement Normal view FAST Positive Probe placement Normal view FAST PositiveLesson 9: Skills :Managing Trauma Vic tim 157Identify urinary bladder and look for the black, anechoic/hypoechoic strips around the bladder representing free fluid to label FAST positive. Suprapubic view Probe placement Normal view FAST positive Fracture pelvis Sheet wrapPelvic binder The pelvic binder reduces the venous bleed and bleeding from bone ends. Splinting of the pelvis helps to reduce pain and movement. It is used in a haemodynamically unstable patient with an unstable pelvis or suspected pelvic fracture. It cannot control arterial bleed, so in case the patient is haemodynamically unstable after initial resuscitation and use of a pelvic binder, the patient should be immediately referred for definitive management by the specialist concerned. It is used to give stability to the pelvic ring and applied at the level of the greater trochanter, not at the level of the iliac crest. It must be kept till imaging is done to diagnose exact pathology and definitive stabilization procedure is performed by a specialist. A sheet which is easily available can be wrapped at the level of the greater trochanter. The knot should be secured by two persons. There are commercially available binders which may be used as per instructions. muSCulOSkElET al INjuRIES Immobilization devices 1. using bandages: Bandages are used to create a sling, which works for immobilizing collarbone, shoulder, and upper arm injuries extending down to the elbow. The arm sling is wrapped around the person's body with a large bandage encircling the person's chest. 2. Rolled newspapers, wooden planks, sticks, rolled blanket: Injury to the limbs require a straight supportive splint that secures and aligns both sides of the injury. An open hardback book, rolled newspapers, wooden planks, sticks, rolled blanket, etc. are few quick and handy temporary immobilizer.Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 158 Lesson 9: Skills :Managing Trauma Vic tim An injured finger/toe can be buddy-taped to the adjacent, unaffected fingers, or it can be splinted with small pieces of wood or cardboard until more sturdy splints can be applied. 3. Swath and sling method: can be prepared by folding the square piece of cloth into a triangle. Explain the splinting procedure to your patient and take his or her consent to apply a sling and swathe. Assess distal pulses, motor function, and sensation. Position sling under the injured arm, such that the apex of triangle points towards the injured arm (may tie a knot at triangle apex, it forms a small pouch for elbow rest). Tie behind the neck. Reassess distal pulses, motor function, and sensation. Immobilize the shoulder girdle and upper extremity by tying a swathe around the chest and injured arm with another bandage. Reassess distal pulses, motor function and sensation. 4. Thomas splint This is applied for fractures of the femur for treatment and transport. The splint is used to immobilize a joint above and below the suspected bone fracture/dislocation of a joint. Before splinting, check the neurovascular status. Clean and cover open wounds with a sterile dressing. Measure splint size from the normal limb and prepare it by good padding. (Measure the unaffected leg, length, and circumference at groin level, Add 6-8 inches to the length and 2 inches in the circumference). The lateral side iron is bent proximally to accommodate the greater trochanter. Apply longitudinal traction to align the limb. It is a must to check neurovascular status after splinting. Remember analgesics, tetanus prophylaxis and antibiotics for an open wound. If there is a neurovascular deficit, then remove the splint and position the limb back. If not improved, ask for surgical consultation immediately. 5. Cramer wire splint Used as a temporary immobilizer while transporting a patient with suspected fracture of upper or lower limb. It is made from malleable aluminum wires attached to both sides of strong but flexible aluminum rods with variable width and length. Prepare the Cramer wire splint with good padding for comfort. The splint can be bent easily at any angle which ensures to keep the limb in the desired position. 6. Bohler Braun splint It is a common splint consisting of an iron frame with a set of 3 pulleys, used in wards for immobilization and traction of the lower limb fractures. The first pulley prevents foot drop. The second pulley is for traction in the line with the femur. The third pulley gives traction in line with the leg. The skeletal fraction is given via a K-wire, Steinman pin, Bohler's pin etc. Advantages: The mobile traction is especially useful in cases where transportation is necessary as the traction unit is self-contained to place limb in a comfortable position. Wound care is possible and it serves for multipurpose application. The angle of traction can be changed by changing the pulley, simultaneous traction through Calcaneal/distal tibia Bohler Braun splintLesson 9: Trauma Vic tim 159 Disadvantages and complications: Urination and defecation become difficult, stiffness/contracture formation can occur. There can be common peroneal nerve compression, other complications of recumbency like bed sore, hypostatic pneumonia etc. can occur. Wound Care Wounds may be clean, contaminated (wound containing foreign or infected material) or infected (pus present). Cleaning of wound: The skin is scrubbed with a soap and the wound is irrigated with saline. Prepare the skin with antiseptic. Do not use antiseptics within the wound. Remove loose foreign material such as dirt, grass, wood, glass or clothing. With a scalpel, remove adherent foreign material along with a thin margin of underlying tissue and then irrigate the wound again until the wound is completely clean. Debridement: Gently handle tissues to minimize bleeding. Control residual bleeding with compression, ligation or cautery. Dead muscle is dark in colour, soft, easily damaged and does not contract when pinched. During debridement, excise only a very thin margin of skin from the wound edge. Dead tissue does not bleed when cut. Suturing: For clean wounds, do immediate closure to allow primary healing.For contaminated wounds and clean wounds, which are more than 6 hours old, do a surgical toileting and irrigate the wound with saline, pack with damp saline gauze, leave wound open and close after 48 hours. Contaminated and infected wounds - do not close but leave them open to allow healing by secondary intention. Perform wound toilet and surgical debridement. Leave the wound open after debridement to allow healing by secondary intention. Pack it lightly with damp saline gauze and cover with a dry dressing. Change the packing and dressing daily or more often if it becomes damp. Pain management Reassurance, immobilization and analgesics are used for pain relief. Cold sponging reduces swelling, v internal bleeding and provide pain relief. NSAIDs help decrease swelling and pain or fever. NSAIDs can cause stomach bleeding or kidney v problems in certain people. If you take blood thinner medicine, NSAIDs can cause bleeding. Acetaminophen v decreases pain. Dose 20 mg/kg body weight 6-8 hrly, max. of 4 gm/day. Acetaminophen can cause liver damage if taken in high dose.Narcotics, Tramadol with antiemetic, may be used. v Nerve Blocks v Ultrasound guided nerve blocks with local analgesics are the preferred technique. Brachial plexus block, axillary nerve block, elbow block, wrist block can be performed for upper limb injuries and Epidural block, sciatic femoral block, peroneal nerve block, ankle nerve block for lower limb by any experienced person. It can also be used for continuous pain relief by inserting a catheter. SPINal INjuR y manual In-line Stabilization (mIlS) It helps to immobilize the victim's neck (cervical spine) by splinting the head and torso (shoulders) with the help of arms of medical personnel. Indications Suspected/known cervical spine injury. v Neck pain or neurological symptoms after injury. vProvider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 160 Lesson 9: Skills :Managing Trauma Vic timHead injury or altered consciousness with a history of trauma. v Injury above the shoulder level. v Procedure From the head end: This position is used when the cervical collar is applied or any procedure on the neck (cricothyroidotomy) is being performed. Head on either side is supported by arms at the level of ears, elbows stabilized on the hard surface on trolley or ground. Both hands hold the shoulders with the thumb on the anterior and fingers on the posterior . From standing beside victim's Body: This position is used when any procedure from the head end has to be performed, like endotracheal intubation. An assistant holds the head with his extended fingers kept on either side of the victim's head at the level of ears/ mastoid processes and stabilizes his arms by keeping his elbows gently on the victim's chest, hence splinting victim's neck between head and torso. Cervical Collar Every trauma victim is presumed to have a spinal column injury unless excluded. v The cervical collar should be applied as soon as you receive a trauma victim. v Immobilization achieved by the cervical collar is only 50%. v Indications A high index of suspicion for cervical spine injury is kept in mind when the mechanism of injury is v acute hyperflexion, hyper extension, lateral hyperflexion or hyperrotation (Road traffic accident, fall, weight falling on head, falling forwards downstairs or by being thrown forwards while the head is arrested by a fixed object, as in motor vehicle accidents). Equipment required: Cervical collar Procedure In a conscious patient, instruct not to v move the neck, and to inform you if there is any pain, abnormal sensation or movement restriction. Manual In-Line Stabilization is v maintained during application of collar.Quickly examine the neck for any signs v of trauma prior to placing C collar.Estimation of collar size is done by v measuring the distance from tip of the chin of the patient to the upper end of the sternal bone in a straight line. Depending upon the size, one should choose the smaller of the appropriate matching size. Apply and secure the collar with minimal movement to the head. v It is advised not to release v Manual In-Line Stabilization till the patient is adequately stabilized in a spinal collar. Precautions The cervical collar should fit snug, but not impede respiration. v Cervical Collar does not completely prevent movement of the neck but limits some of the movement v and reduces axial loading. Cervical collarLesson 9: Skills :Managing Trauma Vic tim 161Head should be maintained in neutral position with the help from the head restricting blocks and tied v to the long spine board. log Roll and long Spine board (lSb) Indications: A spinal board is indicated for transport of a victim of spinal injury or suspected spinal injury, suggested by the mechanism of injury and if an emergency team is not able to rule out a spinal injury. The victim should be transferred from the board to a hospital bed as soon as possible especially if hypotensive. Requirement: Four person, a patient model, cervical collars, one long spine board, a blanket, and a towel. procedure: Four person technique :The first person stands at the head end side of the patient and is responsible for providing MILS. He is the team leader while performing Log roll procedure. Second and third person stand on the side towards which the log roll will be performed. He/she should stand close to the trolley in such a way that his body supports the weight of the patient when the log roll is performed so that the patient does not fall over from the trolley. Second person stands on the side of the log roll and at the victim's mid-torso. He then grasps the far side of the victim at the shoulder and just above the wrist. Third person stands next to the second person and grasps near the victim's pelvic bone, his other hand grasps both trouser ends at the ankles. If shorts or dhoti are being worn, tie a figure-of-eight around the ankles with a triangular bandage and grasp the triangular bandage. Fourth person/the examiner stands to opposite side of log roll (opposite side of second and third person) and he will be responsible for examining the complete spine along with applying a Cervical Collar, and placing the LSB alongside the victim. On the count of three by the first person/team leader, the victim is carefully log rolled till patient reaches right angles to the ground. The first person at the head end observes the victim's torso turn and continues to maintain Manual In-Line Stabilisation of the head, thus exactly rotating it with the torso. Second and third person ensure synchronized in-line movement of the torso with the head. After log roll, the fourth person cuts away the clothing covering the victim's back and examines spine, back, gluteal region, posterior aspect of thighs and legs, for any injuries. Besides this, the examiner should also do a per rectal examination. After the examination, long spine board is placed. The patient is slid sideways so that he is centered on the LSB. The LSB acts as a splint for the whole body when the patient is being transported. The patient should be maintained on the LSB for a maximum duration of two hours. Log Roll and Long Spine Board (LSB) Lesson 10: Hospital Preparedness for Emergencies and Disast ers Lesson 10: Hospital Preparedness for Emergencies and Disast ers 163 LESSoN EMERgENCIES AND DISASTERShoSpITAL pREp AREDNESS FoR 10 CORE CONCEPTS Hospitals should be prepared to manage any kind of internal emergency as well as a disaster/ mass v casualty event in its neighborhood. Capacity development of hospital health workforce and optimum resource allocation are the key v factors which help to minimize mortality and morbidity in such events. Hospital preparedness planning is crucial for response to and recovery from such an event. v Key element is Hospital Incident Management System (HIMS) to ensure proper and effective v management of all activities undertaken by the hospital to respond and manage any kind of emergency situation. Often the seniormost Emergency Physician has to take over the role of Incident Manager, till such time v the Hospital information management system (HIMS), if present, gets activated. mass Casualty Incidents (mCI) May take place in the vicinity of the hospital/ health facility or within the facility itself wherein the Emergency Department may receive a large number of patients that need to be evaluated, stabilized, referred to a higher facility or managed within the hospital. Multiple casualty incidents involve a number of victims who require extra resources and the hospital is in a position to organize it. Local resources of the hospital/medical facility are put under stress and patients are triaged with the aim of identifying the patients with the most life threatening injuries to be treated first. This calls for call down of adequate medical, nursing and support staff, the creation of surge capacity and mobilization of sufficient material resources to provide initial triage, evaluation, and stabilization.ObjECTIvES Upon completion of the lesson the trainee would be able to: Understand Role of Emergency Department in Disaster situations v Prepare and plan for disaster situation v Triage and manage causalities in disaster vProvider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 164 Lesson 10: Hospital Preparedness for Emergencies and Disast ersIn situations where there are no pre-hospital incident site triage and management, Emergency Physicians will be in the forefront attending rush of patients coming to the Emergency Departments. The situation may arise, especially in small health facilities (CHC, Sub-district, District hospital), where a lone Physician manning the emergency may have to attend to a mass casualty incident. mass Casualty Events (mCEs) Number of victims are so many that the requirements of resources is more than the capacity of the hospital and hence proper care cannot be provided to all victims. So in such a situation, one should try to do whatever best is possible for the maximum number of victims within the available resources. Triaging is focused on managing patients with the greatest possibility of survival. A critically ill victim of disaster, who under normal circumstances would receive maximum care using maximum resources of the hospital, would be low on priority in receiving proper care in mass casualty situation so that available resources can be utilized for the maximum number of patients. For example, Red category victims, who can be managed with minimum utilization of resources including time, manpower and material, will be treated first. hospital disaster plan To rise to the occasion, doctors/ emergency physicians working in Emergency Departments should be aware of: Hospital disaster plan and in particular the Hospital Emergency Incident Command System. v Emergency Department response plan, procedures, and checklists. v Plan activation and mobilization of personnel for surge capacity. v Call down procedure and a contact list of personnel and call down messages. v Procedure for triage and identification of the patient. v Quick documentation. v Mock drill schedules and ensuring participation. v Role of the Emergency department (Ed) Emergency Department is the central hub of activity in mass casualty events/ disaster settings. All Emergency Departments should have an ED response plan. Like the hospital disaster plan, the ED plan is also a simple, flexible, comprehensive plan adaptable to various disaster settings. The important elements of the ED plan include (i) procedure for plan activation (ii) call down protocol (iii) description of roles and responsibilities (job action cards) (iv) triage criteria (v) life support and (vi) priorities for definitive care. The Emergency Physician should be well-versed with the ED plan and he/ she should actively participate in the exercises for rehearsing ED plan. Emergency department area Planning Emergency Department is the main receiving area for patients once the disaster plan is activated. The doctors/emergency physicians, nurses and paramedic staff working in ED should be well acquainted with areas earmarked for: Reception v Triage v Decontamination v Treatment v Communication desk v Non-patient care area v Holding area for relatives v Area for holding the media personnel. vLesson 10: Hospital Preparedness for Emergencies and Disast ers 165All these areas should be mapped and displayed in the Emergency Department. This should also form part of the ED response plan and hospital disaster plan. In addition, the Emergency Physician should be aware of the patient flow (inflow to designated triage areas and outflow to OT/ ICU/ ward/ mortuary/discharge) in a Mass Casualty Incident. Role of Emergency Physician/Ed doctor during a mass Casualty Incident As per call down protocol, call the earmarked personnel and provide the call down message. v Take charge as Incident Commander (IC) of ED, till such time the designated IC takes charge. v Assign a staff to call the Incident Commander, doctors, nurses and support staff identified in the call v down procedure, for emergency response. Decontaminate patients/ ambulances/ vehicles, if the situation so warrants. v Undertake Triage. v Provide Life Support through NELS approach. v Reassess the patients in the triage categories for change in status. v Identify patients for discharge/ transfer [to other wards] if surge capacity is to be created. v Keep ambulances ready if patients need to be referred to nearby hospitals/ higher center. v Update ED's medical supplies and requisition supplies in case shortfall is anticipated. v Manage fatalities and disaster victim identification. v Address legal issues in mass casualty and fatality incidents. v Emergency documentation v Clinical Pearls Early to arrive and crowd the ED are the less injured -\"walking wounded\". \u0083 Most of the severely injured patients are expected to arrive subsequently. \u0083 In addition to role as an emergency physician providing emergency life support, stabilization and v definitive care, other critical roles that an emergency physician/ ED doctor has to perform during a Mass Casualty Incident are dealt in detail: Call down administrator (till such time the Hospital disaster plan is activated). \u0090 As Incident Commander \u0090 Oversee Triage \u0090 Roles and responsibilities in accordance with Job Action Sheets \u0090 Call down administrator Scenarios in which patients start arriving in sudden-onset disasters/ mass casualty incidents, the Emergency Physician has to call the senior most authority of the hospital and report the event. He has to assign a staff for the call down procedure to inform all concerned to report for duty. A Call down message needs to be prepared immediately. An illustration is given below: Call Down Message in the event of mass causality: Hello, this is Mohan Lal, your Emergency Call Operator. I am calling to inform you that there has been a blast resulting in a mas casualty incident in garment factory at Anant Nagar at about 11.30 p.m. You are requested to report to your respective department immediately. The time of convey of this message has been recorded. Thank you for your understanding.Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 166 Lesson 10: Hospital Preparedness for Emergencies and Disast ersas Incident Commander The Emergency Physician has to be well acquainted with the Hospital Emergency Incident Command System. Apart from his prime role as a physician, he may have to double up as an Incident Commander, especially for sudden onset disasters, where a large number of patients report to the emergency. This role will continue till such time the earmarked Incident Commander takes over. brief purview of hospital emergency Incident Command System (ICS) The Incident Command System (ICS) refers to the management system applied to management of disasters. The National Disaster Management Authority, Government of India defines an Incident Response System as \"the combination of facilities, equipment, personnel, procedure and communications operating within a common organizational structure, with responsibility for the management of assigned resources to effectively accomplish stated objectives pertaining to an incident\".

All sections (operations, planning, and logistics) are headed by a Section Chief under whom there are v Directors, Supervisors and Unit Leaders. An example of Incident Command System vIncident Commander: Medical Superintendent voperation Chief: Addl MS of the hospital. Responsible for tactical actions to achieve incident objectives. Expansion of the Operation Section depends on the enormity of the situation and number of different types and kinds of functional Groups required in the response management Operation section includes Medical Teams, Ambulance Task Force, Diagnostic Services, Social and Psychological support services. vplanning Chief: Addl MS (planning). Responsible for collection, evaluation and display of incident information, maintaining and tracking resources, preparing the Incident Action Plan (IAP) and Lesson 10: Hospital Preparedness for Emergencies and Disast ers 167other necessary incident related documentation. Responsibility is of Human Resource management (Medical, nursing, paramedics, pharmacists, and labour), Patient information and Tracking. Logistics Chief: v CMO (Logistics). The Logistic section is responsible for providing facilities, services, materials, equipment and other resources in support of the incident response. Responsible for Stores, Kitchen, Communication, Sanitation, and Transportation. The Finance Branch is included under Logistics section. v Finance: Chief Accounts Officer and staff. v Triage \"Triage\" is derived from the French word \"Trier\" which means 'to sort' or 'to choose'. \"Triage\" is the process of categorizing a patient according to the degree of severity/ seriousness of his/ her medical condition in the event of a large number of patients/ casualties reporting to/ being brought to the emergency department of a hospital. Principal of Triage Triage is not a static, one-time intervention. Patients must be assessed and reassessed called retriaging v at many places like at the site of the incident, at the time of transportation, in various patient care areas like emergency department, during the investigations (X-ray, CT, MRI), at the time of wheeling for surgical intervention, admission to an ICU, and in the Operation Theatre). When there is prior information and time permits to call a trained senior person designated as triage v officer, it must be done. Designated triage officer should be a senior most person trained to do triaging, has participated in mock drills in disaster management of the hospital, who has knowledge about existing hospital disaster plan, hospital resources and availability of manpower and material at that moment. When there is no prior information or time is limited to call the triage officer, a senior most person v on duty should take the responsibility of triaging. In a small hospital, this person will have to do multiple roles. It will be easier for him to manage the victims of disaster after triaging for treatment and transfer. Triage Protocol Triage Protocol is to be followed by doctors, nurses and paramedics in an emergency department of the hospital or at the site of any mass casualty/ disaster to prioritize treatment of those patients who, if provided optimum medical care have the highest probability of being saved. The colour codes followed to categorize patients/ victims of any mass casualty event/ disaster are: Colour Description / Remarkspriority to be given the patient Patient presents with life threatening cardiovascular shock or hypoxia. May survive if provided immediate life saving medical interventions. Highest Priority (Category I) Patient presents with injuries which have systemic implications but cardiovascular shock or hypoxia is not present. Will survive if provided optimum medical interventions within a few hours.Medium Priority (Category II) Walking wounded. No life threatening injuries/ complications. Localized injuries which do not have any systemic implications. Well oriented to time, place and person. All vital signs are stable.Low Priority (Category III) Brought dead.

He is not a high-risk patient. Fever is present for the last 24 hours. History and examination do not point to a specific diagnosis. Therefore, the patient may be discharged with oral paracetamol. No laboratory investigations are required in the emergency. At discharge, he should be asked to follow up in outpatient if the fever does not subside in next 2 days or he develops features of serious infection. Scenario 2: Fever in a Children A 2 year child presents with fever for the last two days. The pulse is 130/minute and blood pressure is 100 mmHg systolic. He is lethargic with capillary refill time >3 seconds. Rest of the systemic examination is normal. Both minor and life-threatening infections (e.g., meningitis, bone and joint infections, pneumonia, v urinary tract infection etc.) are common. All febrile, toxic-looking children below 3 years of age should be hospitalized for empiric v antibiotics.Toxic-looking children are those with: v Signs of poor perfusion skin, >3 seconds, hypotension), \u0090 hyperventilation, and cyanosis.Lethargy (a level of consciousness characterized by poor or absent eye contact or failure of a \u0090 child to recognize parents or to interact with persons or objects in the surroundings).Incessant cry. \u0090 Laboured breathing. \u0090 Non-toxic children between the ages of 3 months to 3 years may be sent home: v If the temperature is below 39\u00b0C, without apparent localization. \u0090 Laboratory tests and antibiotics may be withheld. \u0090 Ensure a follow up within 24-48 hours, or earlier if worsening. \u0090 Non-toxic children between the ages of 3 months to 3 years with a temperature above 39\u00b0C : v Require a complete blood count. \u0090 If total leukocyte count is above 20,000 cmm, admit and start antibiotics. \u0090 If the child is below 1 month of age : v The child should be hospitalized for empiric antibiotics. \u0090 Collect cultures and perform a lumbar puncture. \u0090 If the child is between 1 and 3 months of age and is appearing non-toxic, assess whether the child has v low-risk criteria.

The child requires initial resuscitation with intravenous normal saline along with laboratory tests including blood and urine cultures. He should be given empirical antibiotics in the emergency itself and admitted. Scenario 3: Febrile Neutropenia A 24 year patient is on chemotherapy for an acute leukemia. On the 8th day of chemotherapy, he develops a fever (temperature 38.6\u00b0C) along with pain in the perineal area. His pulse is 108/min and blood pressure is 116/80 mmHg. There are no clinical signs of infection on examination.Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 176 Lesson 11: Medical Emergencies :Acut e Fever, Environmen tal Emergencies and PoisoningIn patients with neutropenia (neutrophils <500/cmm), any temperature more than 38.3\u00b0C or 38\u00b0C on v two occasions within one hour is considered significant. Besides the usual assessment, evaluate other potential sites of infection such as central or peripheral lines. v Pay special attention to the oral mucosa and perineal area for any breakdown or signs of mucositis. v Avoid a rectal examination in neutropenic patients because of the risk of causing a tear that may result v in bacterial translocation. Instead, ask the patient to \"bear down\" and evaluate the rectal mucosa by external exam only. Patients should be started on broad-spectrum antibiotics or Meropenem as soon as possible gram- v negative (especially Pseudomonas) coverage such as Ceftazidime or Piperacillin-Tazobactam.For unstable patients, consider adding Injection Amikacin or Tobramycin. v If there is a concern for central line infection, add gram-positive coverage with Injection Vancomycin. v For concerns about mucositis or typhlitis, incorporate anaerobic coverage by using Injection v Piperacillin-Tazobactam or by adding Clindamycin or Meropenem. discussion This patient is most likely to have febrile neutropenia. Since he complains of pain in the perineal area, ask him to \"bear down\" to evaluate rectal mucosa. Antibiotics such as Piperacillin/Piperacillin plus Tazobactam should be started after obtaining various cultures. It will cover anaerobic infections as well since there is a possibility of rectal mucositis. Scenario 4: Other Febrile Illnesses A 20 year boy presents with fever for 3 days and has associated myalgias and mild arthralgias. He passed urine two hours ago in adequate quantity. He does not have any features to suggest a localized infection. There is no abdominal pain, vomiting, reddish patches over skin or gum bleed. Acute fever without any localization can be due to Dengue, Chikungunya, malaria, scrub typhus, v leptospirosis and typhoid fever. It may not be clinically possible to distinguish any of these infections. v In patients with acute fever without an apparent localization, it is important to look for some features v which may indicate some of these infections: Severe arthralgias suggest dengue and chikungunya. \u0090 Rigors may indicate malaria. \u0090 Jaundice and reduced urine output may suggest leptospirosis. \u0090 Eschar (well defined blackish scab) suggests scrub typhus. dengue hemorrhagic Fever Dengue fever is defined as \"fever of 2-7 days with two or more of the following: a headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, with or without leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, and no evidence of plasma leakage.

If the hematocrit is stable, IV fluids should be reduced and gradually stopped over 24-48 hours.Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 178 Lesson 11: Medical Emergencies :Acut e Fever, Environmen tal Emergencies and PoisoningManagement of Severe Dengue fever Patients with severe plasma leak, severe bleeding or severe organ impairment. v Require emergency treatment and admission or referral. v If the patient has hypotension, an initial bolus of saline or ringer lactate is 15-20 ml/kg over 15 minutes. v If the patient shows improvement and the hematocrit remains same as baseline value or falls slightly, gradually lower the rate of infusion and again stop after 36-48 hours. If the clinical condition does not improve and the hematocrit falls, start 10 ml/kg of blood. Management of bleeding In the case of overt severe bleeding, an urgent blood transfusion is life saving. However, if the blood v is not available, shock may be managed with IV fluids or plasma expanders. If the patient has an active bleeding, it should be treated with the blood transfusion, and then if required v platelet transfusion.Prophylactic platelet transfusion is only indicated if platelet count is below 10,000. v discussion Case 4 has a fever without any localized source of infection. He is stable and has a few features suggesting a possible diagnosis of dengue. He does not have any warning features of dengue fever. A complete blood count (including haematocrit, total leukocyte count and platelet count) should be done. Since the patient is able to tolerate oral fluids, he can be discharged on oral paracetamol and fluids with instruction to follow up in the next 24 hours for re-evaluation.

Transfered to the ICU for continuous vital monitoring. v Arranged for all routine investigations including Chest X-ray. v Clinical Pearls Children with fresh water drowning may occasionally develop hyponatremia and \u0083 hyperkalemia; rarely seen in adults. Other complications: Delayed onset of pulmonary edema, Hemolysisand acute renal \u0083 failure. Scenario 2: drowning with aRdS A 21 year female was found submerged in the nearby river and was brought to the ED in a drowsy state with a respiratory rate of 34/min, pulse rate of 50/min, blood pressure of 90/50 mmHg, oxygen saturation of 75%, and on auscultation of chest with bilateral crepitations. management Follow ABCD. v Arterial blood gas analysis shows hypoxemia with both respiratory and metabolic acidosis. v Start high flow oxygen. Initiate NIV (noninvasive ventilation) if available. v If unconscious and desaturating: intubate. v She requires PEEP with mechanical ventilation to maintain adequate oxygenation that is PaO v2 >60- 70 mmHg and correction of respiratory failure. Maintenance of intravenous volume and correction of metabolic acidosis. v ChEmICal ExPOSuRE EmERgENCIES Core Concepts Pulmonary oedema and respiratory failure may set in after exposure to a sufficiently high concentration v of chlorine gas, the onset of which may be delayed by up to 36 hours.Ocular or skin chlorine exposure requires immediate decontamination for at least 15 minutes. v In case of suspected carbon monoxide poisoning, check arterial blood gas as SpO v2 measurements are misleading.For exposure to tear gas, protection of medical staff is fundamental while managing these patients. v Scenario 1: Chlorine poisoning A previously normal 15 year girl comes to the emergency department of a hospital with complaints of an unintentional exposure to chlorine gas when she was at a public swimming pool. The workers at swimming pool were mixing sodium hypochlorite with hydrochloric acid at a nearby place. On arrival, she has main complaints of breathlessness, irritation in eyes as well as dry cough, along with chest discomfort. Her blood pressure at presentation was 100/68 mmHg, pulse rate of 68/min, respiratory rate 25/min and pulse oximeter showed oxygen saturation of 86% on room air. On auscultation chest was clear.Lesson 11: Medical Emergencies :Acut e Fever, Environmen tal Emergencies and Poisoning 185management Follow the ABCD approach. v Remove from exposure and protect yourself. v Skin decontamination: v Remove all clothing and personal effects. \u0090 It is important to double-bag soiled clothing and place it in a sealed container with clearly labeled \u0090 on the bag as 'biohazard'. Liberal amounts of water and soap should be used to wash hair and all contaminated skin for at \u0090 least 10-15 minutes. It is important to decontaminate open wounds first and care to be taken to avoid contamination of unexposed skin. Take special attention regarding skin folds, axillae, ears, fingernails, genital areas and feet. \u0090 If eyes have been exposed to chlorine: v One should remove contact lenses if being used at once, adequately irrigate the affected eye with \u0090 water or 0.9% saline for a sufficient time, at least 10-15 minutes. Examine with fluorescein for corneal damage. If present, refer for urgent ophthalmological assessment. \u0090 If symptoms do not resolve, seek expert opinion. Give O v2 along with bronchodilators, if necessary. For laryngeal or pulmonary edema, administer Inj. Hydrocortisone 200 mg. IV as a bolus. v In severe cases, noninvasive ventilation may be needed. v Patients with symptoms when seen in a hospital usually need admission for at least 24 hours for v observation. Record serial peak expiratory flow rates, which may warn of deterioration. Victims with minor exposure to chlorine but no symptoms may be allowed to go home with advice to v rest and return if symptoms appear. Clinical Pearls Respiratory System and Cardio Vascular System: Onset of pulmonary oedema and respiratory \u0083 failure may be delayed by up to 24-36 hours after exposure to a sufficiently high dose. Skin: exposure of skin to concentrated chlorine may cause significant dermal burns whereas \u0083 the pressurised liquid can result in frostbite.Eye: Immediate stinging and burning along with lacrimation and blepharospasm may \u0083 occur. It is important to remember that high concentration exposure may also cause ocular burns. Scenario 2: Carbon monoxide poisoning A 72 year gentleman presents to the Emergency wing of a hospital following a house fire. The flat which was below his residential flat in the apartment complex had caught fire during the night hours, which resulted in awakening the patient along with his family. The Smoke then rose from below through the floors, windows, and this resulted in the patient getting significant exposure and smoke inhalation. He was rescued by the Fire services personnel. The trained paramedics in the ambulance initially administered him with high-flow oxygen therapy. The patient was shifted to the hospital with high flow oxygen therapy and monitoring of his vitals and oxygen saturation. The patient arrived at the hospital in a state of drowsiness; he was noted to be less responsive as compared to what he had been at the scene as assessed initially by the paramedic.Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 186 Lesson 11: Medical Emergencies :Acut e Fever, Environmen tal Emergencies and Poisoningassessment There was no indication of facial burns, external burns or singed nostril hair. v Airway examination didn't reveal any stridor, hoarseness, or any other overt evidence of airway v obstruction.

If unconscious, intubate and provide IPPV on 100% O v2. Record ECG and monitor heart rhythm: for arrhythmias and signs of acute MI. v Check ABG and VBG (will show similar PaO v2 values). Check Carboxy-haemoglobin (COHb) levels in the blood. v Correct metabolic acidosis by ventilation and O v2. Consider Mannitol, if cerebral edema is suspected. v Clinical Pearls Check ABG as SpO \u00832 measurements are misleading in CO poisoning, In centres where hyperbaric oxygen therapy facilities are available, it should be utilized for \u0083 cases of severe poisoning. Scenario 3: Tear gas There was a student demonstration in town that turned violent and Police resorted to tear gas to disperse the crowd. Some of the rioters complained of severe eye pain, watering, and burning sensation of the face, breathing difficulty and vomiting and were brought to the emergency department.Lesson 11: Medical Emergencies :Acut e Fever, Environmen tal Emergencies and Poisoning 187This was due to tear gas exposure, 2- chlorobenzalmalononitrile (CS). Despite its name, tear gas is not a gas, but an aerosol. management Essential to place exposed victims in a well ventilated area. This should preferably have a free flow of v air which will help the gas to get dispersed. Also essential is that no unprotected attendants are present downwind. Follow the ABCD approach. v Inhalation of beta v2 agonists may be necessary. This is especially for the patients who have a history of existing respiratory problems for e.g. obstructive airway diseases. It is important to anticipate the fact that mechanical ventilation may rarely be needed in these cases. Patients who continue to have persistent respiratory complaints would need admission to hospital for v observation; these patients may get symptomatic benefit by administration of humidified oxygen.Pulmonary oedema and reactive pneumonitis should be managed with appropriate supportive v measures.Contamination of the eyes with CS will require adequate irrigation of the eyes with water, this will aid v in the removal of exposing toxin.Elderly patients should be vigilantly monitored for clinical features and signs of acute glaucoma. v The skin should be liberally irrigated with soap and adequate free flowing water. v Any burns resulted from the exposure should be managed on the lines of thermal burns. v For dermatitis and erythema, topical steroids and antiseptic solutions may be used. v Generally, once the irritant symptoms settle, then usually only mild conjunctival injection or minor v corneal abrasions may persist. As judged clinically, these patients can then be discharged from the hospital with a short course of broad-spectrum antibiotic eye drops with appropriate clinical follow-up. Contaminated clothing needs to be removed and adequately sealed in plastic bags. If clothes are being v washed in a washing machine, it is preferable to use a cool cycle over the hot cycle as hot water will cause any persisting residual CS to vaporize with a risk to nearby individuals. protection of medical & paramedical staff: This is essential while managing these victims. v The appropriate use of protective gear including proper fitting protective goggles, disposable clean v rubber gloves along with adequate protective garments which will lead to covering the full length of arms and legs usually suffices. POISONINg Core concepts Resuscitation and stabilization. v Reduce exposure. v Diagnose type of poison involved by history and assessment (toxidrome) and simple laboratory tests. v Reduce absorption of poison by various gut decontamination methods. v Enhance excretion of the already absorbed toxin. v Use of antidotes. v Supportive treatment. vProvider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 188 Lesson 11: Medical Emergencies :Acut e Fever, Environmen tal Emergencies and Poisoningapproach to a patient with acute Poisoning One should always remember that, as in any other emergency, the first step in managing a patient with poisoning is resuscitation and stabilization using the ABC approach. Other steps are undertaken concurrently (and not sequentially) following initial resuscitation. assessment and action Resuscitation and Stabilization Stabilize ABC as in any other emergency. v Decontaminate the skin and eyes in case of an external exposure to a chemical agent. v Specific consideration in ABCs In case of caustic ingestion, evaluate the oropharynx for signs of injury and auscultate over the neck v and chest for any stridor. The airway should be protected early by prompt intubation. In case of ingestion of hydrocarbons like kerosene oil, aspiration is common which may require v intubation and ventilation.Infusion of large volumes of intravenous fluids is not recommended. However, volume deficit if v present should be corrected. For example, in lithium overdose, volume depletion needs to be corrected by intravenous fluids as this will enhance excretion of lithium. If a patient is hypotensive following overdose of beta blocker or calcium channel blocker agents, v infuse fluids carefully as a large volume of fluid may precipitate congestive heart failure. Clinical Pearls Hypoxia and hypoglycaemia should be identified and managed at the time of resuscitation \u0083 in all cases of altered sensorium. All patients with altered sensorium should be disrobed and examined thoroughly for \u0083 injuries. Investigations Electrocardiogram ECG should be obtained in all patients with acute poisoning, especially tricyclic antidepressants, v digoxin, aluminium phosphide, organophosphate and cocaine. It can also reveal associated electrolyte abnormalities. Other laboratory tests Urine may show oxalate crystals in ethylene glycol poisoning. These crystals appear like envelopes. v In methemoglobinemia, blood is chocolate in colour. v Anion gap: v It is the difference between the measured anion gap and calculated anion gap. Anion gap is calculated as Sodium - (Chloride + Bicarbonate). Normal anion gap is 8-14 mmol/L. v The mnemonic to remember the causes of increased anion gap is MUDPILES: M - Methanol, Metformin, Massive ingestions U - UraemiaD - Diabetic ketoacidosisP - ParacetamolLesson 11: Medical Emergencies :Acut e Fever, Environmen tal Emergencies and Poisoning 189I - Iron, Isoniazid L - Lactic acidosisE - Ethylene glycolS - Salicylates general management Decontamination: It should be undertaken after appropriate personal protection by using gown, gloves, mask, eye-wear, etc. Skin: Soiled clothes of the patient should be removed and the skin washed with copious amounts of water.gastrointestinal system: Several gastrointestinal decontamination procedures may be used to reduce absorption of toxin from the gut. However, before performing any procedure, consider three factors: Is the ingestion potentially toxic? v Can the procedure remove significant amount of toxin? v Whether the benefits of the procedure outweigh its risks? v Caution: It is advised that Gut decontamination should not be considered unless the patient has ingested a potentially lethal amount of a toxic agent within 4 hours (although some consider these measures only if a patient presents within an hour of ingestion). gastric lavage If the patient has altered level of consciousness, then the airway should be protected before performing v gastric lavage. A large-bore orogastric tube should be passed into the stomach with the patient in left lateral v position.Contraindicated in ingestion of caustics, and hydrocarbons. v activated Charcoal The dose is 1-2 g/kg or a ratio of 10 parts of activated charcoal to one part of toxin, whichever is v higher. Certain toxins are poorly adsorbed to activated charcoal and include lithium, iron, cyanide and v hydrocarbons.It is contraindicated in caustic ingestion and the presence of ileus. v dialysis and hemoperfusion Hemodialysis is effective in removing dialyzable toxins including salicylates, lithium, methanol, v isopropanol, ethylene glycol, theophylline, and phenobarbital.In addition, haemodialysis may be required in patients who develop acute kidney injury following v poisoning or who develop severe electrolyte imbalance. An example is the lactic acidosis associated with metformin toxicity. antidotes This table gives a list of commonly used antidotes. If specific antidote is available, it should be v administered.Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 190 Lesson 11: Medical Emergencies :Acut e Fever, Environmen tal Emergencies and PoisoningTable 11.2: Antidotes to Specific Poison Antidote Specific nitrite, producing prolongation of QRS complexes Supportive Treatment The most important treatment for patients with poisoning is supportive treatment: Central nervous system - control of seizures and care of the comatose patient. v Cardiovascular system - control of hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias. v Respiratory system - adequate oxygenation/ventilation. v Support of renal function. v Correction of fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base disturbances. v Correction of hypothermia or hyperthermia. v Specific medication used during resuscitation and stabilization These include dextrose, naloxone, thiamine, atropine, and flumazenil. dextrose Hypoglycaemia can mimic several conditions including stroke. Several agents such as insulin, oral v anti-diabetic agents, alcohol, salicylates, and quinine may produce hypoglycaemia. Dextrose should be given if blood glucose is below 80 mg/dl or is between 80-100 mg/dl if the patient v has focal neurological deficits. Dose is 2 ml/kg of 50% dextrose in adults or 4 ml/kg of 25% in children and 5 ml/kg of 10% dextrose in infants. Naloxone It is an opioid antagonist. Presence of respiratory rate less than 12 per minute is the single most v sensitive indicator for its administration. The initial dose is 0.1-0.2 mg, unless the patient has respiratory depression when the dose is 2 mg. If v there is no improvement and no features to indicate withdrawal (yawning, tachycardia, piloerection, sweating, etc.), the subsequent dose is 2 mg every 2 minutes for a total of 10 mg. Since the duration of action of Naloxone is only 30-60 minutes, the patient should be observed for v recurrence of opioid toxicity. Lesson 11: Medical Emergencies :Acut e Fever, Environmen tal Emergencies and Poisoning 191atropine It is the main antidote for organophosphates and carbamates. v It is indicated if the patient has miosis, excessive sweating, poor air entry due to bronchorrhoea, v bronchospasm, bradycardia, and hypotension. If these features are not present, the patient should be observed for at least 12 hours. An initial dose of Atropine is 1.8 to 3.0 mg intravenously. Five minutes after administration, check for v cholinergic toxidrome. Double the dose after 5 minutes, if improvement has not occurred.Target end-points for Atropine therapy are clear chest on auscultation with no wheeze, heart rate >80 v beats/min, systolic blood pressure dry axillae and pupils no longer pin-point.Once atropinized, set up an infusion of Atropine at an hourly dose of 10-20% of the total dose of Atropine v given initially. Review the patient every 15 minutes to see that target end-points are maintained. Further boluses may be given if required. Thiamine Thiamine may be administered in alcoholics and malnourished patients. v Dose is 100 mg intravenously. v Flumazenil Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine antagonist. It is indicated in pure benzodiazepine overdose with v respiratory depression. Flumazenil may precipitate seizures in patients on chronic therapy with benzodiazepines and cardiac v arrhythmias in mixed-drug overdose. The initial dose of flumazenil is 0.2 mg IV(10 mcg/kg) over 1 minute and followed 1 minute later with v 0.3 mg if the patient does not respond. Toxidromic approach to diagnose Type of Poison A toxidrome is defined as the presence of a constellation of signs and symptoms produced by a group of poisons to which the patient has been exposed. To identify the toxidrome, a detailed history and physical examination including vital signs, pupillary size, skin - whether dry or moist and bladder - whether empty or full is performed. Cholinergic toxidrome The commonest toxidrome in Indian setting is cholinergic toxidrome, produced by organophosphate v and carbamate insecticides, and chemical warfare agents like sarin and soman. These agents inhibit cholinesterases leading to accumulation of acetylcholine at various receptor sites. The features of cholinergic toxidrome Miosis pressure, - Salivation, Sweating \u0090 The three 'Bs' of mnemonic for muscarinic effects are known as the killer 'Bs'. vProvider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 192 Lesson 11: Medical Emergencies :Acut e Fever, Environmen tal Emergencies and Poisoninganticholinergic toxidrome This toxidrome is produced tricyclic antidepressants, phenothiazines, v antihistamines, antiparkinsonian drugs and atropine. These agents block the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptor sites. This toxidrome is opposite to the muscarinic effects of cholinergic toxidrome. v The patient develops tachycardia and cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, hyperthermia, mydriasis, v dry eyes, dry mouth, dry and flushed skin, reduced bowel sounds and retention of urine. CNS features include confusion, delirium, and seizures. Sympathomimetic toxidrome Sympathomimetic toxidrome is produced by amphetamines, cocaine, phencyclidine, etc. Features v are similar to those of anticholinergic poisoning, except that the skin is wet and sweaty, there is no retention of urine and intestinal motility is normal. Opioid toxidrome Opioid respiratory depression, hypotension, pin-point pupils and coma. v Miosis is not present in all cases. In addition, mydriasis may occur in severely poisoned patients, v secondary to hypoxia. Sedative-hypnotic toxidrome Produced by benzodiazepines, barbiturates, alcohol, anticonvulsants, and v Features include decreased level of consciousness, hypoventilation, hypotension and bradycardia. v Barbiturates also produce hypothermia and miosis. Algorithm 11.2: For Patient with Acute Poisoning Brief history and examination Dene toxidrome Administer specic antidote (naloxone, atropine, etc.) if indicated Consider dialysis, if indicated Consider gastric lavage and activated charcoal, if indicated, in presentation within 4 hours of ingestion Consider skin decontamination, if indicated Get a blood glucose done Exclude associated injuriesYes NoManage ABCIf exposure is through inhalation, remove the patient from the source Patient with altered sensoriumLesson 11: Medical Emergencies :Acut e Fever, Environmen tal Emergencies and Poisoning 193SPECIFIC POISONS Paracetamol Paracetamol is one of the common causes of poisoning. mechanism of toxicity The toxicity is due to metabolite, N-acetyl-para benzoquinone imine (NAPQI) which causes v liver injury. Toxic dose of Paracetamol is 150 mg/kg and is more than 8 g in adults. v A 4-hour blood level of paracetamol more than 150 mg/l is potentially toxic, warrants treatment. Clinical features During the early stages, patients have non-specific features like nausea and vomiting with normal liver v function tests. Maximal hepatotoxicity occurs between 72-96 hours after ingestion and manifests as an acute liver failure with coma. Renal function abnormalities may develop in some cases. management N-acetylcysteine or NAC is the antidote. NAC can be given either orally or intravenously and is safe v in pregnancy. Dose of IV NAC is 150 mg/kg over 1 hour, followed by 50 mg/kg over 4 hours and then 100 mg/kg v over 16 hours (total 21 hours).Oral dose is 140 mg/kg followed by 70 mg/kg every 4 hours for 17 doses. If a patient vomits within v one hour of a dose, a repeat dose should be given. Salicylates Salicylates are frequently used as painkillers and antipyretics. v Oil of Wintergreen v contains a very high concentration of methyl salicylate which is a precursor of aspirin. Clinical features The earliest signs and symptoms of salicylate toxicity develop within 1 to 2 hours of ingestion and v include nausea, vomiting, sweating and tinnitus.These are followed by early CNS features like tachypnea, hyperactivity, agitation, delirium and v hallucinations. Coma, seizures and pulmonary edema are late manifestations.Hypoglycemia and hypokalemia are frequent. Therefore, check glucose and potassium. v Typical acid-base disturbance is metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis. v Hyperthermia is common and indicates severe toxicity. v management Maintain intravascular volume by intravenous fluids. v Increase urine pH to above 7.5 by infusing sodium bicarbonate. v Administer dextrose and potassium to correct hypoglycemia and hypokalemia. v Hemodialysis is advisable in severe cases. vProvider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 194 Lesson 11: Medical Emergencies :Acut e Fever, Environmen tal Emergencies and Poisoningmethanol (methyl alcohol) mechanism of toxicity Methanol itself is non-toxic however, when metabolized to formaldehyde and formic acid by the v enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase, features of poisoning develop. These acids result in high anion gap acidosis. v Clinical features V omiting, seizures, respiratory failure and blindness. v The optic fundus shows disc hyperemia. v management The antidotes for methanol poisoning are fomepizole or 4-methylpyrazole, and ethanol. v Ethanol acts as a competitive substrate for alcohol dehydrogenase in methanol poisoning and is v therefore used in therapy. Ethanol Ethanol competes with methanol for alcohol dehydrogenase. v In a 60 kg patient, an oral loading dose of 140 ml of 40% ethanol (commercially available whiskey), v diluted with an equal amount of water should be given through the nasogastric tube. The maintenance dose is 25 ml/hour of 40% alcohol diluted with double the amount of water. Others If patient has severe acidosis not responding to antidote therapy, bicarbonate and dialysis are required. v benzodiazepines These agents include diazepam, lorazepam, alprazolam, etc. Clinical Features Drowsiness, ataxia, respiratory depression. v Hypothermia. v Coma v Death resulting from benzodiazepine overdose is extremely rare and is most often due to combination v with other sedatives or alcohol. management Treatment is supportive. v Flumazenil is indicated only in presence of respiratory depression. It may cause refractory seizures v in chronic users, in patients with seizure disorders, co-ingestion of seizure-causing agents and the presence of raised include atenolol, beta blockers results in hypotension, bradycardia, A V blocks and precipitation of v congestive heart failure. Respiratory depression, seizures and coma may also occur. v In children, hypoglycaemia may be seen. vLesson 11: Medical Emergencies :Acut e Fever, Environmen tal Emergencies and Poisoning 195management Treatment is supportive. v Initial treatment of bradycardia and hypotension is atropine and fluids. v Other modalities of therapy include calcium gluconate, high dose insulin-euglycemia therapy, v epinephrine and dobutamine, and if these fail, milrinone and inamrinone. High dose insulin euglycemia therapy improves cardiac function. A typical dose of insulin is 1 unit/kg v IV along with 0.5 g/kg of dextrose. This is followed by an infusion of insulin at 0.5 unit/kg/hour along with dextrose to maintain euglycemia. Calcium Channel blockers These agents include verapamil, diltiazem, nifedipine and amlodipine. Clinical features Clinical features are similar to beta-blocker poisoning with patient developing bradycardia, v hypotension, and conduction delays. Hyperglycaemia is often noted in these patients. v management Atropine and fluids should be started early. v Calcium gluconate, vasopressors, insulin-glucose and phospho-diesterase inhibitors may be used. v IV lipid emulsion may be tried in severe cases. v digitalis Digitalis inhibits Na-K ATPase pump and leads to shifting of potassium from intracellular to v extracellular compartment producing hyperkalemia, A V blocks, and cardiac arrhythmias.Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypercalcemia increase toxicity of digitalis. v Clinical features Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, lethargy, confusion and weakness. v In overdose, it can produce cardiac arrhythmias, most commonly VPCs. v Hyperkalemia is a bad prognostic indicator. v management The antidote is digoxin specific Fab fragments. If the dose of digoxin is not known, start with v 5 vials of Digibind\u00ae. It is indicated in severe arrhythmias, symptomatic bradycardia, A V blocks with hyperkalemia and digoxin levels over 10 ng/ml. Ventricular arrhythmias may be treated with phenytoin. v Calcium administration is contraindicated if digoxin toxicity is suspected as it may produce cardiac v dysfunction and arrhythmias including cardiac arrest. hydrogen Sulphide A common scenario in India is when sewage workers go down to clean sewers but die, due to inhalation of hydrogen sulphide gas. Poisoning can also occur in oil refineries and mines. It is also known as a knockdown agent, as it causes rapid loss of consciousness due to loss of central v respiratory drive. It has the smell of rotten eggs. vProvider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 196 Lesson 11: Medical Emergencies :Acut e Fever, Environmen tal Emergencies and PoisoningIt inhibits cellular respiration by blocking cytochrome oxidase and results in anaerobic metabolism. v Elimination of hydrogen sulphide can be enhanced by producing methemoglobin. v Treatment involves removal of the victim from the source of exposure and use of nitrites to generate v methemoglobin. Corrosive agents Acids produce coagulation necrosis of tissues with eschar formation which limits deep penetration v of acids. Alkali ingestion is more common and it causes liquefaction necrosis of tissues which facilitates v progression. Full thickness injury can occur due to deep penetration. management Oropharynx should be inspected for signs of injury and drooling, and neck and chest should be v auscultated for stridor. Presence of airway injury suggests a need for early intubation. However, blind nasotracheal intubation is contraindicated as this may cause further damage to the already injured mucosa. Charcoal and lavage are contraindicated. v An upright chest X-ray should be done to exclude air under the diaphragm. v Early endoscopy is important to determine the extent of the damage. v Cocaine Clinical features Produces sympathomimetic toxidrome - hypertension, tachycardia, seizures, dilated pupils, v hyperthermia, agitation and diaphoresis.Psychiatric complaints are frequent. Patients may complain of a feeling of insects crawling on the skin v along with itching.Occasionally, cocaine can produce status epilepticus, stroke, myocardial infarction and v rhabdomyolysis.The ECG may show ST-segment elevation in V1 to V4 with tachycardia. v management Benzodiazepines and external cooling. v Beta blockers should be avoided as they may cause unopposed alpha stimulation leading to aggravation v of hypertension and myocardial ischemia.Thrombolytics are not indicated in presence of ST segment elevation in the ECG as the patients often v have associated severe hypertension, seizures or intracranial bleed. hydrocarbons Poisoning due to hydrocarbons such as kerosene oil is quite common in children. v Abuse of petroleum products through inhalation is also seen in young persons. v Clinical features Aspiration pneumonitis producing coughing and tachypnea is common after ingestion. Chest X-ray v shows findings only after 4-6 hours after aspiration.Inhalation of hydrocarbons can sensitize the myocardium which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias. vLesson 11: Medical Emergencies :Acut e Fever, Environmen tal Emergencies and Poisoning 197management Mainly supportive. v Induction of vomiting is contraindicated. v Gastric lavage is not indicated. v There is no role of steroids and prophylactic antibiotics. v Catecholamines should be avoided as far as possible because inhaled hydrocarbons sensitize the v myocardium to endogenous catecholamines. Isoniazid or INh In overdose, INH reduces vitamin B6 level. Vitamin B6 is required for GABA synthesis which is an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Due to deficiency of GABA, the patient gets seizures. Clinical features Triad of poisoning with INH is refractory seizures, metabolic acidosis and coma. v management Pyridoxine in high doses of 5 gm or more is required to control seizures and acidosis. It should be v given intravenously, but if IV preparation is not available, pyridoxine may be given intramuscularly. Iron A dose of 20 mg/kg of iron is toxic while more than 60 mg/kg is lethal. v Clinical features It is important to stress here that the absence of symptoms, especially vomiting in the first 6 hours after v ingestion excludes serious iron toxicity. The early stage of iron toxicity is characterized by nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhoea, v which may result in dehydration and shock. Some patients may also have upper or lower GI bleed. Advanced stage of toxicity manifests itself with hypovolemia, vasodilatation, poor cardiac output, v coagulopathy, hepatic failure, coma and death. laboratory features Diagnosis can be confirmed by elevated serum iron level at 4 hours. v Elevated liver enzymes. v High anion gap metabolic acidosis, hyperglycemia, and leukocytosis. v An abdominal X-ray may show radio-opaque iron tablets which may form bezoar. v management Supportive treatment. v Activated charcoal does not adsorb iron. v Whole bowel irrigation may be done to remove iron from the gut. v Deferoxamine. v Antidote deferoxamine is indicated if the patient has severe GI symptoms, metabolic acidosis, or v shock, or serum iron is more than 500 mcg/dl.Dose is 15 mg/kg IV over 1 hour followed by 5 mg/kg/h as an infusion. The infusion is continued till v vine rose colour/symptoms persist.Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 198 Lesson 11: Medical Emergencies :Acut e Fever, Environmen tal Emergencies and Poisoningantidepressants Amitriptyline, nortriptyline, imipramine, doxepin, etc. Clinical Features Develop within 6 hours of ingestion - flushed skin, dry mouth, mydriasis, decreased bowel sounds, v and retention of urine. CNS effects include confusion, ataxia, delirium, seizures, and coma. v CVS features as hypotension, tachycardia, widening of QRS, VT, and torsades. v ECG shows right axis deviation with negative S in lead I and positive R in A VR. v management Activated charcoal in early presentation. v Induction of vomiting and flumazenil are contraindicated. v Hypotension is treated with IV saline, sodium bicarbonate and norepinephrine. v Sodium bicarbonate is the antidote for wide QRS complexes and ventricular dysrhythmias. Dose is 1 v mEq/kg bolus followed by 15-20 mEq/hour as infusion maintaining blood pH between 7.5 and 7.6.Magnesium sulphate is used to treat torsades - 1-2 gms in 100 ml 5% Dextrose over 5-15 minutes. v Repeat the dose as infusion, if needed.Benzodiazepines - to control delirium and seizures. v Neuroleptics or antipsychotics Antipsychotics or neuroleptics include the commonly used as as atypical antipsychotics such as sedation, psychosis, urinary retention, v seizures, etc. ECG changes - prolongation of QT interval and cardiac arrhythmias. v management Toxic features are treated with benzodiazepines, fluids, monitoring and if required with sodium v bicarbonate and magnesium. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome - a rare complication, is controlled with external cooling, v benzodiazepines, dantrolene, bromocriptine and if required, by neuromuscular paralysis.Treatment of atypical antipsychotic poisoning is mainly supportive. Sodium bicarbonate may be used v for prolonged QRS. In severe cases, physostigmine and intravenous lipid emulsion may be used. lithium Clinical features Features of lithium toxicity include vomiting, diarrhoea, tremor, confusion, slurred speech, seizure, v coma, and prolongation of QT interval and arrhythmias.Lithium is mainly excreted by the kidneys. Hyponatremia and hypovolemia reduce lithium excretion v and hence increase the chances of toxicity.Lesson 11: Medical Emergencies :Acut e Fever, Environmen tal Emergencies and Poisoning 199management Aggressive hydration with normal saline, avoiding diuretics, lavage in early stages, and potassium v exchange resin. Activated charcoal is not effective. v Whole bowel irrigation may be given to remove lithium from the gut. v Seizures should be controlled with benzodiazepines & phenobarbital. Phenytoin should be avoided as v it reduces lithium excretion.Haemodialysis is indicated if lithium level is more than 3.5 mEq/L, the patient has coma or seizures v and in presence of renal failure or congestive heart failure where fluids cannot be given. methemoglobinemia-producing Toxins Methemoglobinemia can be produced by The patient develops cyanosis if the levels of methemoglobin are more than 15%. v diagnosis Diagnosis is suspected when cyanosis is not responsive to oxygen administration. v Methemoglobin imparts chocolate brown colour to the blood. v Pulse oximetry is not reliable as it gives an oxygen saturation of about 85%. v Arterial blood gas also gives normal PO v2. Confirmation of diagnosis is by measuring fractions of hemoglobin by co-oximetry . v management The antidote is methylene blue which reduces iron from ferric state to ferrous state. v Should be used if the patient is symptomatic or methemoglobin concentration is more than 30%. v Dose is 1-2 mg/kg given slowly over 5 minutes as a 1% solution. If required, a second dose can be v repeated after 1 hour. anticholinergic agents Drugs like antihistamines, antidepressants, phenothiazines and atropine produce v toxidrome (dry, flushed skin, dry mucus membranes, dilated pupils, reduced bowel sounds, retention of urine, tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias, confusion, delirium, and seizure). In addition, several plants like deadly nightshade and datura also produce this toxidrome. v management Treatment of agitation, delirium and seizures by benzodiazepines. v For wide-complex tachycardia, the drug of choice is sodium bicarbonate. v For ventricular arrhythmias, use amiodarone or lidocaine. v For torsades de pointes, administer magnesium sulphate, and if not effective try overdrive pacing. v anticoagulants Anticoagulant-based rodenticides are warfarins and superwarfarins. v With warfarin, prothrombin time increases over 8-24 hours and this lasts for as long as 5 days. vProvider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 200 Lesson 11: Medical Emergencies :Acut e Fever, Environmen tal Emergencies and PoisoningSuperwarfarins are long acting and the effect may last for several weeks to months. v These agents block synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, X which results in v bleeding from various sites.

The need for the emergency physician to identify and resuscitate such patients at the time of arrival is v of utmost importance and early surgical consultation is mandatory for optimum results.Acute abdomen due to perforation peritonitis, acute intestinal obstruction, obstructed hernias require v prompt recognition and management. INTROduCTION Acute abdomen is the acute attack of unexpected abdominal pain that occurs suddenly or gradually over a period of a few hours. It has various causes, both intra- and extra-peritoneal, and does not always require the need for surgical intervention. However, timely assessment and action (NELS guidelines) can reduce the morbidity and mortality and result in the better patient outcome. Abdominal pain may also be caused by non-surgical conditions, e.g. Inferior wall myocardial infarction patient may present with epigastric pain. Other common medical conditions presenting with abdominal pain include diabetic ketoacidosis, uraemia, narcotic withdrawal etc. It is therefore essential that the emergency physician ensure oxygenation and perfusion along with thorough assessment by taking a detailed history and examination in order to manage the patient appropriately. As per NELS guidelines, detailed assessment and appropriate action are required in every case of acute abdomen.ObjECTIvES Upon completion of the lesson the trainee would be able to: Assess common life threatening and potentially life threatening acute abdominal v surgical emergencies. Promptly recognize acute abdominal emergencies which require surgical v consultation. Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 204 Lesson 12: Surgical Emergencies Acut e AbdomenInitial assessment and action Assess ABC and resuscitate as per NELS principles. v Take detailed focused history, do thorough general and systemic examination. v Get necessary investigations e.g. blood investigations, X-rays, Ultrasound etc. v Consider differential diagnosis. v Give broad-spectrum antibiotics. v Pain management. v Urgent surgical consultation and disposition. v ClINICal PRESENT aTION history A few points that need to be kept in mind while taking history in an acute abdomen are: 1. pain: Time of onset and duration \u0090 Mode of onset \u0090 Site of pain \u0090 Migration, radiation and referred pain \u0090 Migration of pain denotes that the pain has migrated from one site to another, and the pain no longer exists at the initial site, e.g. in acute appendicitis pain starts in umbilical region and then migrates to right iliac fossa. Radiation is the pain experienced at a different site, pain is present at the two sites simultaneously, e.g. Ureteric colic pain is felt simultaneously at loin and groin. Referred pain is the pain experienced at a site that is anatomically not contiguous with the primary site, and occurs due to the common root supplying the dermatome and the affected organ, e.g. In acute cholecystitis pain may be referred to right shoulder tip: Character of pain: v Burning pain in peptic ulcer. \u0090 Tearing or ripping pain in aortic dissection. \u0090 Colicky pain in obstructive conditions of genito-urinary, hepato-biliary and intestinal tract. \u0090 Continuous pain in Intestinal ischemia and peritonitis. \u0090 Relieving factors: sitting upright and leaning forward in pancreatitis, lying still with knees bent in v peritonitis, eating food in duodenal ulcer. Aggravating factors: food aggravates pain in intestinal obstruction, acute cholecystitis or acute v pancreatitis. 2. Vomiting: Usually occurs after the onset of pain in the surgical conditions. 3. Bowel habits: A history of constipation, diarrhoea and the presence of blood in stools. 4. urinary Symptoms: Dysuria, haematuria and past history of renal/ureteric stones. 5. past history: Past abdominal surgery: Indicates an adhesive intestinal obstruction. v Medications: NSAIDs may cause peptic ulcer and upper GI bleed. v Co-existing medical conditions: H/O MI or AF to make the clinician suspect of mesenteric v vascular ischemia.Lesson 12: Surgical Emergencies Acut e Abdomen 2056. personal history: Alcohol, tobacco and illicit drug use. Chronic alcoholics may present with recurrent episodes of v pancreatitis. Gynaecological history: LMP, abnormal vaginal bleed, vaginal foul-smelling discharge, multiple v partners etc., should be enquired about. Ruptured ectopic pregnancy may also present with acute abdomen. 7. Family history: to rule out any inheritable disease-causing pain abdomen, e.g. Hypercoagulable states of hereditary origin may present with acute abdomen due to mesenteric ischemia. general Examination 1. Appearance: Lying still suggests peritonitis v Pale, diaphoretic and anxious suggests vascular conditions like dissecting abdominal aortic aneurysm, v angina or mesenteric ischemia. Writhing in pain, restless suggests colicky pain. v 2. Vitals may show: Tachycardia due to anxiety, pain and hypovolaemia v Hypotension in hypovolaemia v Tachyponea as compensation to improve oxygenation. v Febrile in inflammatory and infective conditions. v Systemic Examination A thorough abdominal examination should be done in a systematic manner: Look for previous surgical scars, distension of abdomen, visible peristalsis and hernia sites. v Feel for any tenderness, abdominal guarding, rigidity, rebound tenderness, and any palpable lump. v Listen on Percussion to find out obliteration of liver dullness suggestive of pneumo-peritoneum, free v fluid, and rebound tenderness. Listen on Auscultation to bowel sounds and bruits. v Digital rectal examination (DRE) may reveal ano-rectal growth, tenderness or the presence of blood. v Investigation for acute abdomen Complete blood count v Urine analysis v Blood sugar v ECG v Kidney function test (Blood urea, serum creatinine, serum electrolytes) v Serum amylase and Direct) v Urine for hCG (in ladies of reproductive age group) v X-ray chest with both domes of the diaphragm v X-ray abdomen erect and supine v USG abdomen vProvider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 206 Lesson 12: Surgical Emergencies Acut e AbdomenWhile correcting physiological parameters, based on history, clinical examination, biochemical and radiological investigations, the emergency physician can reach a diagnosis in the majority of the cases. In cases where diagnosis still remains in doubt or obvious surgical indication, early surgical consultation is mandatory. Ruling out life threatening conditions causing acute abdomen is the top priority. Consider antibiotic administration and relieve pain. The following section deals with the clinical scenarios and how to proceed. It also throws light on the necessary investigations, thus avoiding the delay as well as expenses. It will also help to decide whether the patient requires transfer to a hospital with a surgical facility. SCENaRIOS Scenario 1: acute appendicitis A 24 year healthy male comes to the ED with one day history of acute abdominal pain. The pain was initially around the umbilicus and has now migrated to the right lower abdomen. History of fever and vomiting is present. Does not give a history of diarrhoea, dysuria or other significant complaints. assessment On assessment of the airway and oxygenation, no abnormality is detected With pulse Rate of 95/min, BP of 118/76 mmHg, and Temperature of 99.4 F.Abdomen is non-distended. Tenderness and rebound tenderness in right iliac fossa is present. Bowel sounds are present. Investigations Blood tests: v Leucocytosis supports the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Imaging: v USG may help in diagnosis. Although CECT abdomen is the diagnostic modality of choice, in practice decision to operate is based on clinical, laboratory and ultrasound findings. Provisional diagnosis Acute appendicitis v differential diagnosis Mesenteric lymphadenitis, Meckel's diverticulitis in children. v Right ureteric colic, Right torsion of testes in adult males. v Ruptured ectopic pregnancy, Torsion of right ovarian cyst in adult female. v Colonic carcinoma in elderly. v action Keep nil orally, and start IV fluids. v Initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics covering gram - negative bacilli and anaerobes. v Get surgical consult for further management. v highlights of the case (appendicitis) The migratory nature of the pain, i.e. starting from the peri-umbilical region and the shifting to right v iliac fossa is typical of appendicitis. Raised temperature, tachycardia, tenderness and rebound tenderness in RIF along with leucocytosis is v enough to clinch the diagnosisLesson 12: Surgical Emergencies Acut e Abdomen 207Scenario 2: acute pancreatitis 46 year male alcoholic patient with 3 days of severe upper abdominal pain radiating to the back. Gives a history of vomiting. assessment Vitals are pulse rate 120/min, Blood Pressure 98/65 mmHg, Respiratory Rate 22/min, and Temperature v is 98.6\u00baF The abdomen is mildly distended with tenderness in the epigastric region with guarding. There is no v rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are sluggish. Provisional diagnosis: Acute pancreatitis Investigations Blood tests: v Leucocytosis may be present. Serum amylase raised more than three times the normal. Imaging: v X-rays of the chest to rule out respiratory complications and gas under (Rt) dome of diaphragm. USG abdomen to look for any biliary pathology, pancreatic oedema and peri-pancreatic fluid v collection etc. action 1. Oxygen inhalation if required. 2. Nil orally. 3. Naso-gastric aspiration. 4. IV fluids reamain most crucial in managing ac. pancreatitis. 5. Administer parenteral analgesics. 6. Monitor urine output. 7. Obtain surgical consultation. highlights of the case (acute pancreatitis) Severe pain abdomen in chronic alcoholics should raise suspicion of an acute pancreatitis. v The pain is boring, constant in nature, severe, starting from the epigastrium and radiating to the back. v Serum amylase is raised more than three times the normal, confirms the diagnosis. v points to remember Serum amylase may be raised in conditions other than Acute Pancreatitis e.g. intestinal obstruction, v intestinal perforation, biliary tract disease, Ectopic pregnancy, malignant tumours of lung or ovaries. Scenario 3: Peritonitis with perforated peptic ulcer 72 year male patient with a history of CAD on tablets aspirin and clopidogrel, with several days of dull upper abdominal pain which is now worsening. The patient complains of pain \"in entire abdomen\" today. H/O vomiting present. Distended and diffusely tender to palpation. Abdominal guarding and rigidity is present, rebound tenderness is present. Liver dullness is obliterated. Bowel sounds are absent. Provisional diagnosis: peritonitis with perforated peptic ulcerProvider Course Manual: Na tional Life Suppor Lesson 12: Surgical Emergencies Acut e AbdomenInvestigations Radiological: X-ray chest (erect) with both domes of the diaphragm: show free air under right dome of diaphragm. action Keep nil orally. v Initiate intravenous fluids. v Perform Naso-gastric tube aspiration. v Foley's catheterization for urine output monitoring. v Start Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs). v Broad spectrum antibiotics covering aerobes and anaerobes. v Obtain a surgical consult for early surgical intervention. v highlights of the case (peritonitis due to perforated peptic ulcer) The history of chronic intake of aspirin and periodic pain suggests a peptic ulcer disease. The recent v change in the nature of pain with vomiting and failure to pass flatus or faeces suggests complication such as peritonitis due to peptic ulcer perforation. X-ray chest showing free gas under the right dome of the diaphragm corroborates the clinical diagnosis. v points to remember Absence of free air under right dome of the diaphragm doesn't rule out peptic perforation as it is v seen in 75% of the cases only. Free air under the diaphragm can be due to a small or large bowel perforation, not necessarily peptic v perforation. Scenario 4: acute intestinal obstruction 35 year female patient presented to the emergency department with generalised abdominal pain and distention for 2 days. Gives a history of repeated vomiting. not passing flatus and stool for the last 2 days. There is past history of an exploratory laparotomy for abdominal trauma 3 year back. assessment Vitals are pulse rate of 100/min, BP of 130/85 mmHg, and Temperature is 97.6 v \u00b0F. Per Abdomen examination revealed moderate distention, no tenderness or rebound tenderness, bowel v sounds are increased and hernia sites are normal. Provisional diagnosis: Acute intestinal obstruction Investigations Radiological: v X-ray abdomen both erect and supine shows dilated bowel loops with multiple air fluid levels. USG abdomen may be helpful. v action Keep nil orally v Insert Naso-gastric tube for aspiration v X-ray chest X-ray abdomen Lesson 12: Surgical Emergencies Acut e Abdomen 209Initiate IV fluids v Urinary catheterization to monitor urine output v Administer Antispasmodics and v Antibiotics v Obtain a surgical consult v highlights of the case (acute intestinal obstruction) The typical history of abdominal pain, vomiting, abdominal distention and not passing flatus or faeces v point towards the diagnosis of an acute intestinal obstruction. The presence of previous laparotomy scar and typical abdominal X-ray findings clinch the diagnosis. v points to remember Bowel sounds may be absent in acute intestinal obstruction later in the course of the disease, bowel v ischemia or gangrene. Pseudo obstruction in elderly patients mimics acute intestinal obstruction. Treatment is v conservative. Scenario 5: Right ureteric colic 27 year male with a complaint of severe colicky pain in the right flank radiating downward into the groin and medial side of the right thigh since morning.

Efforts should be made to maintain euglycemia and euthermia while managing ABCD. maINT aININg TEmPERa TuRE Maintaining temperature is an essential step in managing sick newborns and sick children, for example with shock or with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM). Normal temperature in a newborn is 36.5\u00baC-37.5\u00b0C. Axillary temperature is good for measuring temperature of a newborn. It is recorded by placing the bulb of thermometer against the roof of dry axilla, keeping baby's arm close to the body to keep thermometer in place for three minutes. assessment of Temperature by Touch Baby's temperature can be assessed by touching his/her abdomen, hands, and feet with the dorsum of hand. When feet are cold and abdomen is warm, it indicates that the baby is in cold stress. In hypothermia, both feet and abdomen are cold to touch. Consequences of hypothermia In hypothermia baby uses a lot of energy to keep himself warm. A cold baby: Is less active, does not breastfeed well has a weak cry, has respiratory distress. v Has risk of becoming hypoglycaemic v As soon as a sick child is brought with temperature below 35.5\u00baC or who is cold to touch (where thermometer is not available), maintain thermal environment as given below. Thermal Environment Keep the infant dry and well wrapped. v Cap, gloves and stockings are helpful to reduce heat loss. v Keep the room warm (at least 26\u00ba v C), making sure that there is no heat source directed straight at the newborn. Keep the baby under a radiant warmer and re-warm so as to bring the child' s temperature to 36.5\u00ba v C. Pay special attention to avoiding chilling the infant during examination or investigation. v Monitor temperature every half hourly for the first 2 hours and then every 2 hourly . v Check and Treat hypoglycemia Check for blood glucose in all children presenting with emergency signs, those with severe acute malnutrition and all sick young infants: If hypoglycemia detected (defined as < 45mg/dl for young infants and < 54mg/dl in older sick children beyond 2 months), give I/V bolus dose of 10% dextrose, in the dose of 2 ml/kg for young infants, and 5 ml/kg for older children. If you cannot measure blood glucose, give bolus dose as above. managing airway and breathing The letters A and B in \"abcd\" represent \"airway and breathing\". If there is no problem with the airway or breathing, you should look for signs in the areas represented by c. To assess if the child has an airway or breathing problem you need to know: (Algorithm 13.3)Lesson 13: Neona the child breathing? b) Is the airway obstructed? c) Is the child blue (centrally cyanosed)? d) Does the child have severe respiratory distress? Algorithm 13.3: Assessment of Airway and Breathing Infants <2 months the process of resuscitating gasping or apnoeic baby below 2 months is same as that at birth. Most babies breathe spontaneously but one in twenty babies might require help with breathing at birth. Upto half of them (who require resuscitation) have no identifiable risk factors before birth. Hence, resuscitation must be anticipated at each birth. At least one personnel who is skilled in newborn resuscitation should be present in delivery area/emergency area. An increased risk of breathing problems may occur in babies who are: Pre-term. v Born after long traumatic labor. v Born to mothers who received sedation during the late stages of labor v Preparations should include having a warm corner to do the resuscitation, along with necessary equipment and supplies. Any baby can have breathing difficulty at birth. It is important to anticipate and be prepared for this eventuality in all deliveries Preparing For Resuscitation Essential 1.

If he is not breathing or has gasping respiration, SHOUT FOR HELP & activate emergency response system. Activation of ERS means immediate mobilization of resuscitation equipments (including defibrillator wherever available) and skilled staffs at the site. How to check pulse v Check the child's pulse (take at least 5 seconds but no more than 10 seconds). You may try to feel the child's carotid or femoral pulse. Locating the Carotid or Femoral Pulse vProvider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life 13: Neona tal and Pedia tric EmergenciesTo perform a pulse check in the child, palpate a carotid or femoral pulse. If you do not defiantly feel a pulse within 10 seconds, start chest compressions. For palpating a carotid pulse, locate the trachea, using 2 or 3 fingers; slide these 2-3 fingers in to the v groove between the trachea and the muscles at the slide of the neck. Feel for pulse at least 5 seconds but no more than 10 seconds Place 2 fingers in the inner thigh, midway between the hip bone and the pubic bone and just below v the crease, where the thigh meets the abdomen. When a child or infant has a palpable pulse, but is not breathing effectively, rescuers should give breaths without chest compressions. This is rescue breathing. Reassess pulse after 15-20 breaths (1 min). In infants and children, if, despite adequate oxygenation and ventilation, the pulse is starting with chest compression (C-A-B sequence) management of the airway and breathing in an unresponsive /gasping child with Palpable Pulse Respiratory arrest Respiratory arrest is the absence of respirations (apnoea). During initial phase of respiratory arrest and inadequate ventilation, the victim has cardiac output (blood flow to the body) detectable as a palpable central pulse. The heart rate may become slow, and cardiac arrest may develop if rescue breathing is not provided. Cardiac arrest in infants and children does not usually result from a primary cardiac cause. More often it is the terminal result of progressive respiratory failure or shock, also called an asphyxia arrest. Asphyxia begins with a variable period of systemic hypoxemia, hypercapnia and acidosis, progresses to bradycardia and hypotension and culminates with cardiac arrest. Is the airway obstructed? Children are at higher risk of having respiratory obstruction and failure due to small size of upper airway, large size of tongue, smaller and compliant subglottic area, relatively compliant chest wall and limited oxygen reserve. To treat an airway or breathing problem first open the airway and then begin giving oxygen. The drawings below show the chin lift (Figure 13.1 and 13.2). This is a way of opening the airway in children who have not been subjected to trauma. The drawings illustrate two different positions. It is also important to know the child's age because you will position an infant differently from a child. head tilt-chin lift manoeuver The neck is slightly extended and the head is tilted by placing one hand on to the child's forehead. Lift the mandible up and outward by placing the fingertips of other hand under the chin. In an infant, a neutral position (nose up) (Figure 13.1) and in a child a sniffing position (chin up) is maintained (Figure 13.2). Figure 13.2 Sniffing Position to Open up Airway in a Child (Chin Up)Figure 13.1 Neutral Position in an Infant Is Trauma of the neck a possibility? Always ask and check for head or neck trauma before treating as further injury must be avoided during assessment or treatment. If you suspect trauma, open airway with jaw thrust to limit the risk of aggravating a potential cervical spine injury while you immobilize the cervical spine. Jaw thrust is safe to use in cases of trauma for children of all ages. The jaw thrust is achieved by placing two or three fingers under the angle of the jaw on both sides, and lifting the jaw upwards and outward (Figure 13.3). The jaw thrust manoeuver is also used to open the airway when bag-mask ventilation is performed.Lesson 13: Neona tal and Pedia tric Emergencies 219 Figure 13.3 Jaw Thrust without Head Tilt Kneel behind the patient's head. v Rest your elbows on the surface on which the patient is lying. v Place one hand on each side of the patient's head. v Place the tips of your index and middle fingers under the angles of the patient's jaw. (This is done on v both sides) Place your thumbs on the patient's jaw just below the level of the teeth. The thumbs will keep the v patient's head from turning or tilting during the lift. Lift the jaw upward with your fingertips. The mouth should not be closed as this could prevent air from v entering the patient's airway. Use your thumb to retract the patient's lower lip if needed. If the lift does not open his airway (tongue is still blocking the airway), lift the jaw up a little further. v If you are unable to obtain an airway with the jaw-thrust method, the head-tilt/chin-lift method should be used. The importance of maintaining a patent airway outweighs the risk of spinal damage. vENTIla TE WITh bag & maSk If the child is not breathing even after the above manoeuvres or spontaneous ventilation is inadequate (as judged by insufficient chest movements and inadequate breath sounds), ventilate with a self-inflating bag and mask as shown in Figure 13.4. Figure 13.4 Self inflating bag Bags and masks should be available in sizes for the entire pediatric range (size 0, 1 and 2). It is important for the mask to be the correct size for the child; it must completely cover the mouth and nose without covering the eyes or overlapping the chin. (Figure 13.5)Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 220 13: Neona tal and Pedia tric Emergencies Figure 13.5: Choosing correct size of mask Self-inflating bags of volume 250 ml for a preterm baby and 450-500 ml for a term baby are used. Use force and tidal volume, just enough to cause the chest to rise visibly. Initially start PPV with room air, depending on target saturation achieved oxygen delivery can be increased from 21% to 60-90% through oxygen source (5-6 L/min) and reservoir connected to the self-inflating bag during resuscitation. Perform the bag and mask ventilation with E-C clamp technique (Figure 13.6). Position the thumb and index finger in a C shape over the mask and exert downward pressure on the mask to ensure proper air seal. Position the last 3 fingers under the angle of mandible to lift the jaw. If you are alone, maintain the E-C clamp with one hand and compress the bag with the other hand. More effective ventilation can be achieved when performed by 2 persons. Figure 13.6: Bag and mask ventilation If effective ventilation is not achieved (i.e., the chest does not rise) perform the actions listed in Box 13.1. If signs of circulation are present but spontaneous breathing is absent, continue bag and mask ventilation. Call for help in any child who needs bag and mask, since some of these children may additionally need chest compression.

Chest Compressions: If you do not confidently detect a pulse or other signs of circulation or if heart rate is less than 60/min in an infant or child with signs of poor perfusion even after adequate oxygenation and ventilation, provide chest compressions coordinated with ventilations. The techniques for chest compression vary for a child under 1 year and those between 1-8 years and are detailed below: Chest compression in the infant (less than 1 year of age)thumb technique, where the 2 thumbs are used to depress the sternum, while the hands encircle the torso and the fingers support the spine (Figure 13.7).Lesson 13: Neona tal and Pedia tric Emergencies 221In this method, compress the lower half of the sternum just below the nipple line but do not compress v the xiphoid. \"Push fast\": push at a rate of approximately 100-120 compressions per minute. v Release completely to allow complete recoil of the chest by completely releasing the pressure, but v maintaining contact with the compression site.Minimize interruptions in chest compressions. v Figure 13.7: Thumb technique of chest compression Chest compressions for the child (1 to 8 years of age) (Fig 13.8) Place the heel of one hand over the lower half of the sternum. Lift your fingers to avoid pressing on v the ribs. Figure 13.8: Chest compression for the child use of aEd in infants and children (Figure13. 9) 1. Ideally child pads should be used for infants and children< 8 years of age. 2. Anterolateral pad placement is used in children while in infants, the pads are placed anteroposteriorly (see figure 13.9). 3. As lower energy dose is often needed in infants, a manual defribrillator should be used in infants. If not available, an AED with a pediatric dose attenuator can be used. If neither is available, one can use an AED without a pediatric dose attenuator.

A harsh noise on breathing in v (inspiration) is called stridor, a short noise when breathing out (expiration) in young infants is called grunting. Both noises are signs of severe respiratory problems.

Lesson 13: Neona tal and Pedia tric Emergencies 223gIvINg OxygEN TO a ChIld WITh RESPIRa TORy dISTRESS A child with cyanosis or severe respiratory distress is put in a comfortable position of his choice and v given oxygen. In these children, oxygenation is given with a head box (8-10 L/min) or a face mask (5-6 L/min). When the child improves, catheter/prongs can be used for oxygen delivery. In neonates, initiate minimum oxygen flow as per need to maintain SpO v2 between 90 to 94%. Monitor the baby for signs of improvement (respiratory distress i.e. respiratory rate, inter-costal v recession, grunt, colour) with DVM/Silverman scoring (scoring for respiratory distress in newborn)In pre-term babies with respiratory distress at birth start CPAP at birth. v Sources of oxygen to treat hypoxemia are: Oxygen concentrators and oxygen-filled cylinders. Oxygen delivery Give oxygen to a child in a non-threatening manner as anxiety increases oxygen consumption and possibly respiratory distress Oxygen can be administered through different methods like nasal prongs, nasal catheters, masks, oxygen hoods etc. Box 13.4: Nasal prongs They are inserted into the nostrils. Prongs come in different sizes for adults and children as shown v in fig 13.10. In newborns, appropriate sized prongs, fitting well, should be used as large sizes can cause v blanching of the alanasi and injure the nose.A flow rate of 0.5-1 litres/min in infants and 1-2 litres/min in an older child to achieve target v saturations is used.Nasal prongs are preferred over nasal catheter for delivering oxygen to young infants and children v with severe croup or pertussis as catheters can provoke paroxysms of coughing.Place them just inside the nostrils and secure with a piece of tape on the cheeks near the nose. v Figure 13.10: Giving oxygen by nasal prongs Box 13.5: Oxygen head box/hood Mask (need flow rates 5-6 litres/min) or Oxygen hood (need flow rates 8-10 lit/min) are good v devices to achieve oxygenation in severely distressed and in emergency situations. Place a head box over the baby's head.(fig 13.11). v Ensure that the baby's head stays within the head box, even when the baby moves. v However, the head box is a rather wasteful manner of oxygen delivery and should not be used v routinely for permanent oxygen delivery . An alternative method in emergency settings is the use of a face mask. v Using head box with low flow of oxygen can lead to re-breathing of the expired air and is dangerous. vProvider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 224 13: Neona tal and Pedia tric Emergencies Figure 13.11: Giving oxygen by head box.

CIRCula TION The letter C in \"ABCD\" stands for: Circulation (shock) v Coma v Convulsions v Assess the Circulation After the airway, has been opened. Assess if a child has a circulation problem by: Does the child have warm hands? v Is the capillary refill time (CRT) longer than 3 seconds? v Is the pulse weak and fast? v Take the child's hand in your own. If it feels warm, the child has no circulation problem. If the child's hands feel cold, you need to assess the capillary refill. Capillary refill is a simple test that assesses how quickly blood returns to the skin after pressure is applied. It is carried out by applying pressure to the pink part of the nail bed of the thumb or big toe in a child and over the sternum or forehead in an infant for 3 seconds (Figure 13.12). CRT is the time from release of pressure to complete return of the pink color. Normally it is less than 3 seconds. If it is 3 seconds, then this is prolongedLesson 13: Neona tal and Pedia tric Emergencies 225Capillary refill is prolonged in shock because the body tries to maintain blood flow to vital organs and reduces the blood supply to less important parts of the body like the skin (peripheral vasoconstriction). This sign is reliable except when the room temperature is cold. Figure 13.12: Checking capillary refill time Is the pulse weak and fast? The central pulse (a pulse nearer to the heart) should be felt. If this is strong and not obviously fast, then the pulse is adequate and no further assessment is needed. In an infant, the best place to feel pulse is at the middle of the upper arm medially (brachial pulse) or femoral pulse in the groin in a lying down child. Pulse is fast if rate is >160/min in an infant and >140/min in children above 1 year. Box 13.7: Blood Pressure & Shock It is not recommended to check blood pressure to assess for shock during the ETAT because of two reasons: Low blood pressure is a late sign in children and may not help to identify early (compensated) v shock cases. Normal BP readings will not exclude compensated type of shock. v ShOCk If the child has cold hands and a CRT 3 seconds, and a fast & weak pulse, then he or she is in shock. The commonest cause of shock in children is: Loss of fluid from the body as in severe diarrhea v Child is bleeding v Through capillary leak in a disease such as severe dengue fever. v In all cases, it is important to replace this fluid quickly. An intravenous line must be inserted and fluids given rapidly in children with shock unless the child has severe acute malnutrition. Treatment of Shock: Treatment of shock requires teamwork and following actions need to be started simultaneously: If the child has any bleeding, apply pressure to stop the bleeding (do not use tourniquet) v Give oxygen to keep SpO v2 >94 Make sure the child is warm v Establish IV access at an appropriate site or intraosseous access v Take blood samples for emergency laboratory tests (Blood sugar, blood urea, serum creatinine, sodium v and potassium etc.) Start IV fluids vProvider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor 0.1 ml /kg (1:10,000) intravenous can be used in a child who does not respond to initial ventilation and chest compressions and his pulses are absent. Two such doses can be used 3-5 minutes apart. The outcome of babies who do not respond to 2 doses of adrenaline is generally poor but the continuation of therapy may be done in situations where expertise is available or condition is potentially reversible, like poisoning, hypothermia, pneumothorax, etc. The decision to terminate resuscitation rests with the treating physician which is usually based on assessment of etiology, time from arrest to CPR and co-morbid disorders. administering Iv Fluids Rapidly for Shock in a Child Without Severe acute malnutrition (algorithm 13.6) Shock is classified in four types as hypovolemic, cardiogenic, distributive and obstructive shock. Hypovolemia is the predominant cause of shock in children worldwide. Expansion of circulatory blood volume by early volume replacement is important to prevent progression to refractory shock and to reduce the risk of multiple organ dysfunctions. Therefore, quickly establish vascular access in all patients with shock. V olume expansion is best achieved with isotonic crystalloid solutions such as Ringer's Lactate (RL) or Normal Saline (NS). As only approximately one fourth of administered solution remains in the intravascular compartment, large quantity of crystalloid solution must be administered in hypovolemic children. However, large rapid bolus may cause problem in febrile children, children who are malnourished and children with cardiogenic shock. Colloid solutions (e.g. hemoccel, 5% albumin, blood, and fresh frozen plasma) also are efficient volume expanders but are not easily available or may cause sensitivity reactions and other complications. Box 13.8: Initial fluid therapy in a child with shock When signs of shock are detected, rapidly administer a fluid bolus of 20 ml/kg of isotonic crystalloid v solution (RL/NS over 30-60 minutes). Fluid administration rate should be individualized for each patient based on frequent clinical v assessment (pulse rate, capillary refill, breathing rate) before, during and after fluid therapy is given. Placement of a 3-way stopcock in the IV tubing system can facilitate rapid fluid delivery as fluids v can be pushed by syringe.Slower rate (over 60 min) is recommended for children who have febrile illnesses, are malnourished v and children with moderate to severe anaemia.Once you have started fluid, assess for type of shock (hypovolemic distributive, cardiogenic and v obstructive) which is critical to decide further management.Lesson 13: Neona tal and Pedia tric Emergencies 227Algorithm 13.6: I.V.

Children with severe malnutrition should be managed with different type of fluid and a different rate of administration and need close monitoring. In children with SAM it is preferable to administer fluids orally or through nasogastric tube. Only if the child is lethargic or unconscious and cannot swallow or tolerate an NG tube (e.g. vomiting), use IV fluids \u00bd-strength normal saline (N/2) with 5% glucose or Ringer Lactate 15 ml/kg in 1 hr.Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Pedia tric EmergenciesAlgorithm 13.7: I.V.

To assess the child's neurological status, you need to know: Is the child in coma? v Is the child convulsing? v Is the child in coma? An awake child who is obviously conscious. If the child is asleep, ask the mother. If there is any doubt, assess the level of consciousness. Try to wake the child by talking/calling his name loudly. A child who does not respond to this should be gently shaken. A little shake to the arm or leg should be enough to wake a sleeping child. Do not move the child's Lesson 13: Neona tal and Pedia tric Emergencies 229neck. If this is unsuccessful, apply a firm squeeze to the nail bed, enough to cause some pain. A child who does not wake up to voice or being shaken or to pain is unconscious. To assess level of consciousness of a child, a simple scale (A VPU) is used: A Is the child Alert? If not,V Is the child responding to V oice? If not,p Is the child responding to Pain?u The child who is Unresponsive to voice (or being shaken) AND to pain is considered Unconscious. A child who is not alert, but responds to voice, is lethargic. A child with a coma scale of \"P\" or \"U\" will receive emergency treatment for coma as described below. Is the child convulsing Now? Convulsion can be recognized by the sudden loss of consciousness associated with uncontrolled jerky movements of the limbs and/or the face. There is stiffening of the child's arms and legs and uncontrolled movements of the limbs. The child may lose control of the bladder, and is unconscious during and after the convulsion. Sometimes, in infants, but there may be only twitching (abnormal facial movements) and abnormal movements of the eyes, hands or feet. Therefore, observe the infant carefully for convulsion. Treatment of coma and convulsion Treatment of coma and convulsions are similar and will be described together. Airway is managed in a manner similar to treating any child with an airway or breathing problem. Give oxygen to all children with SpO 2 <94 %. If blood sugar is less than 45 mg/dl in normal nutritional status child or less than 54mg/dl in severely malnourished child, he/she has hypoglycaemia. Treat him with 5 ml/kg of 10 % Dextrose IV . Algorithm 13.8: Assessment and treatment of coma and convulsion Coma Any unconscious child who is breathing and keeping the airway open should be placed in the recovery position (Figure 13.13). This position helps to reduce the risk of vomitus entering the child's lungs. It should only be used in children without any trauma. Figure 13.13: Recovery Position of an Unconscious Child Manage airway Position the unconscious child (if head or neck trauma is suspec ted, stabilize the neck first) Give oxygen Check and correct hypoglycemia Give IV calcium if infant <3 months If convulsion continue give anti-convulsantIF COMA OR CONVULSING Coma or CONVULSINGProvider Course 13: Neona tal and Pedia tric EmergenciesIf neck trauma is not suspected: Turn the child on the side to reduce risk of aspiration. v Keep the neck slightly extended and stabilize by placing the cheek on one hand. v Bend one leg to stabilize the body position. v If trauma is suspected: Stabilize the child while lying on the back. v Use the \"log roll\" technique to turn the child on the side if the child is vomiting. v Convulsion If the child is having a convulsion, do not attempt to hold him/her down or put anything in the child's mouth. If the child vomits turn the child on his/her side to avoid aspiration. If the convulsion has stopped and the airway is clear, the child can be placed in the recovery position. Insertion of an Oropharyngeal (Guedel) Airway. It can be used in an unconscious patient to improve airway opening. Guedel airways come in different sizes.

Nurse the baby in Thermo neutral environment and ensure Airway, Breathing, and Circulation (TABC). 2. Start oxygen, get an IV access and send samples for glucose, calcium, electrolytes and other relevant investigations. 3. Take relevant history and perform a quick clinical examination. 4. If blood sugar <45 mg/dl, give a bolus of 2 ml/kg of 10% dextrose followed by glucose infusion at the rate of 6-8 mg/kg/min.5. If calcium levels are not available or serum calcium is low, ie <7mg/dl, give IV 10% Calcium gluconate 2 ml/kg (in 1:1 dilution with distilled water) under cardiac monitoring, withhold infusion if HR<100/min. 6. If seizures persist even after correction of hypoglycemia /hypocalcemia, anti convulsant drugs (ACD) are given: a) Injection Phenobarbitone 20mg/kg IV over 20 minutes. If the baby has no further seizures do not start maintenance. If seizures persist after completion of this loading dose, give additional doses of Phenobarbitone at 10 mg/kg every 20-30 minutes until total dose of 40 mg/kg has been given. b) If seizures persist after maximal dose of Phenobarbitone (40 mg/kg), Phenytoin is given at a dose of 20 mg/kg IV . A repeat dose of 10 mg/kg is given in refractory seizures. Phenytoin should be diluted in normal saline as it is incompatible with dextrose solution. c) If seizures are controlled, a maintenance dose of Phenobarbitone and Phenytoin is started at 3-5mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses,12 hours after the loading dose. Both these drugs are adminis - tered at a rate not more than 1mg/kg/min. d) If seizures still persist, Benzodiazepines are indicated. The commonly used Benzodiazepines are Lorazepam and Midazolam. Diazepam is generally avoided in neonates because of its short duration of antiepileptic effect but very prolonged sedative effect, narrow therapeutic index and the presence of sodium benzoate as a preservative. When used as continuous infusion, the infant must be closely monitored for respiratory depression and bradycardia. The doses of these drugs are:Lorazepam: 0.05 mg/kg IV bolus over 2-5 minutes; may be repeated.Midazolam: 0.15 mg/kg IV bolus followed by infusion of 0.1 to 0.4 mg/kg/hour.Managing convulsions beyond 8 weeks of age.

RElIEF OF ChOkINg IN ChIldREN aNd INF aNTS As in adults, the Heimlich's manoeuvre is used for relief of choking due to foreign body in children above 1 year. For infants less than 1 year, a different technique is used. If the infant is responsive, follow the steps outlined below: (Fig 13.17) 1. Kneel or sit down so that the infant is held in your lap. 2. Hold the infant on your forearm, which rests on your lap for support. The infant lies face-down with the head slightly lower than the trunk. The infant's head and jaw is supported with your hand. Avoid compressing infant's soft tissues with your hand. 3. With the heel of your hand, deliver 5 back slaps between the baby's shoulder blades, using sufficient force to dislodge the foreign body. 4. Now place the free hand on the infant's back, supporting the back of the head with the palm of your hand. 5. With the head and neck supported, turn the infant as a unit so that he lies face-up, the head slightly lower than the trunk. 6. Provide 5 quick downward chest thrusts in the middle of the chest over the lower half of the sternum. Give chest thrusts at a rate of 1 per second with sufficient force to dislodge the foreign body . 7. Repeat the sequence of 5 back slaps and 5 chest thrusts until the foreign body is removed or the infant becomes unresponsive. If the infant becomes unresponsive, begin CPR, starting with chest compressions. In an unresponsive infant, perform the following steps: 1. Shout for help and activate the EMS. Place the infant on a firm flat surface. 2. Begin CPR and each time you open the airway, look for the foreign body in the back of the throat. If you see an object and can easily remove, remove it.Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor 13: Neona tal and Pedia tric EmergenciesRemember that a blind finger sweep must never be performed.

Give a specific antidote, if this is indicated. SNakE bITE Snake bite should be considered in any case of severe pain or swelling of a limb or in any unexplained illness presenting with bleeding or abnormal neurological signs. diagnosis General signs include shock, vomiting and headache. Examine bite for signs such as local necrosis, v bleeding or tender local lymph node enlargement. Specific signs depend on the venom and its effects. v These include: v Shock \u0090 Local swelling that may gradually extend up the bitten limb. \u0090 Bleeding: external from gums, wounds or sores; internal, especially intracranial. \u0090 Signs of neurotoxicity: respiratory difficulty or paralysis, ptosis, bulbar palsy (difficulty in \u0090 swallowing and talking), limb weakness. Signs of muscle breakdown: muscle pains and black urine. \u0090 Check Hb (when possible, blood clotting should also be assessed). \u0090 Treatment First aid 1. Reassure the patient. Seventy percent of all snakebites are from non-venomous species. 2. Clean the wound. 3. Immobilize in the same way as a fractured limb. Use bandages or cloth to hold the splints, not to block the blood supply or apply pressure. Do not apply any compression in the form of tight ligatures. Lesson 13: Neona tal and Pedia tric Emergencies 2394. If any of the above signs are present, transport the child to a hospital that has antivenom as soon as possible. If the snake has been killed, take it with the child to hospital. 5. Avoid cutting the wound or applying a tourniquet. Bite marks to determine whether the biting species was venomous species are in possession of more than one set of fangs and non-venomous species can leave just two punctures from enlarged teeth, which can appear to be fang like. Treatment of shock or respiratory arrest. v Antivenom v If there are systemic or severe local signs (swelling of more than half the limb or severe necrosis), v give antivenom, if available. Prepare IM adrenaline 0.15 ml of 1:1000 solution IM and IV chlorphenamine, and be ready to treat v an allergic reaction.Supportive care v Give fluids orally or by nasogastric tube according to daily requirements. Keep a close record of fluid v intake and output. Provide adequate pain relief. v Elevate the limb if swollen. v Give antitetanus prophylaxis. v Antibiotic treatment is not required unless there is tissue necrosis at the wound site. v Avoid IM injections. v Monitor the patient very closely immediately after admission, then hourly for atleast 24 h, as v envenoming can develop rapidly. Conclusion Triage is the sorting of patients into priority groups according to their need. All children should undergo triage. The main steps in triage are to identify emergency signs, rule out head/neck trauma, management of emergency signs identified, draw emergency blood samples and identify any priority signs and treat and monitor according to illness. The maximum mortality and morbidity is seen in the first 24 to48 hours in serious life-threatening infections. Triaging and emergency management helps to reduce the initial mortality and improve the outcome. Scenarios 1. Meera, 3-year-old is brought to hospital with complaints of 4 days diarrhea.

A nasogastric tube should be gently placed at night before the child sleeps. If this is not feasible gastric lavage can also be collected, if the child is brought to the health facility in the morning after overnight fasting. The length of the tube to be inserted is equal to the distance measured from tip of the nose to tragus plus from tragus to the xiphisternum. Tube can be advanced for an inch extra so as to reach the stomach. The position of the tube should be checked by pushing 5 ml air through the nasogastric tube and hearing for a gush of air below the xiphisternum. Sample can be aspirated in the morning, while the child is still asleep, by connecting 10 ml syringe to the Naso-gastric (NG) tube. Sample should be collected over two consecutive days. If gastric aspirate is less than 10 ml the position of the Ryles tube should be rechecked and an extra 10 ml normal saline should be introduced through the same NG tube. If still aspirate is less than 10 ml, the patient should be rotated to the left lateral position and again aspiration tried though the nasogastric tube. If still no aspirate an extra 10 ml normal saline should be introduced through the same NG tube and aspiration repeated. It still no aspirate, the patient should be turned to right lateral position and gentle suction done again through the nasogastric tube. If Gastric Aspirate is still less than 10 ml, additional normal saline of 10 ml should be introduced via nasogastric tube until a minimum of 10 ml is aspirated. After procedure, the nasogastric tube should be gently removed by closing its cap or pinching the tube. CalCula TION OF Iv INFuSION dOSagE OF INOTROPIC aNd vaSOPRESSOR dRugS Amount of drug to be given in mg, as continuous IV infusion in next 8 hours: = Weight of child (kg) \u00d7 Desired infusion rate in \u00b5g/kg/min. General instructions for solution preparation and infusion: - For infusion, the inotropic and vasopressor agents can be diluted in commonly available IV solutions including NS, N/2 Saline, Isolyte-P, 5% D and 10% D. - Some of inotropic drugs are available as a salt preparation. In such drugs, use the base amount of drug for infusion preparation (e.g. Inj. Norepinephrine contains Norepinephrine Bitartrate, as 2 mg/ml, however the amount of Norepinephrine base is 1 mg/ml. Use the base concentration i.e. 1 mg/ml for preparation of Lesson 13: Neona tal and Pedia tric Emergencies 243solution for Norepinephrine). - Ensure a uniform rate of drug infusion preferably use an infusion pump. If Infusion pump is available, give drugs by infusion pump, and give maintenance IV fluids through a separate line. If Infusion pump is not available, the inotropic drug can be mixed with maintenance IV fluids, however, make sure that drip rate is carefully set so that harm due to faster or slower delivery of drug is prevented. Example 1: For a continuous infusion of dopamine @15 \u00b5g/kg/min in a 12 kg child- Dose required = 12\u00d715/2 = 90 mg of Dopamine as continuous infusion in next 8 hours. Example 2: For a continuous infusion of Noradrenaline @0.6 \u00b5g/kg/min in a 10 kg child- Dose required = 0.6\u00d710/2 = 3 mg of Noradrenaline as continuous infusion in next 8 hours.

Plasma volume increases by 40-50%: On account of this increased blood volume, a pregnant patient v can tolerate blood loss up to 1-1.5 L approximately, without showing signs and symptoms of hypovolaemia. However, maternal hypovolaemia may cause signs of fetal distress which is reflected as abnormalities in fetal heart rate. The cardiac output increases by 40% and reach a peak at 32 weeks. This may cause cardiac v decompensation in a patient with the pre-existing cardiac disease.ObjECTIvES Upon completion of the lesson the trainee would be able to: Describe the anatomical and physiological changes in pregnancy and their impact on v the patient management.

This causes a decrease in the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Oxygen demand is also increased. Functional residual capacity is reduced by 20%, so hypoxia sets in faster. Tidal volume and minute volume increase by 40%. Due to increased minute ventilation, the normal v PaCO2 value is around 30 mmHg.

INTROduCTION TO aNImal bITES aNd INSECT STINgS Animal bites and insect bites/stings are one of the common medical emergencies seen in the Indian subcontinent. Animal bites and insect stings causes breach in the skin and its subsequent sequalae. It usually causes localized reactions but at times may also lead to systematic manifestations and mortality, if not managed adequately and timely. Hence understanding of bites and stings are essential for the front line physician.LESSoN ObjECTIvES Upon completion of the lesson the trainee would be able to: Understand common emergencies requiring immediate assessment and v management Assessment and management of animal bites and insect stings v Initial management of foreign bodies v Suspect and assess foreign bodies in nose, ear, respiratory tract vProvider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 260 Lesson 15: Miscellaneous Emergencies :Bit es ,Stings and Foreign BodiesClinical presentation Common signs and symptoms: Breach in tissue, pain, swelling, fever with chills, sweating, fatigue, and inflammation at the site of the bite, infection, pus or fluid oozing from the wound, loss of sensation around the bite, swollen lymph nodes. Life threatening symptoms: Breathing difficulty, bleeding, muscle weakness or tremors.Complications: Localized cellulitis, bacteraemia, subcutaneous abscesses, and lymphadenopathy. Imaging: Plain radiographs - for deep bite wounds near joints warrant an antero-posterior and lateral plain radiograph to evaluate for disruption of bone or joints and evidence of foreign bodies, such as embedded teeth. Also indicated in markedly infected wounds to detect bony and soft tissue injury, subcutaneous gas, and changes associated with osteomyelitis. Ultrasound may be helpful for identifying abscess formation as well as locating radiolucent foreign bodies in infected wounds. general management of bites vThe initial management of bites and stings: Remains the same i.e. following the assessment and action approach of Airway, Breathing, Circulation and Disability. The management is based on the detection of life-threatening injuries as per NELS protocol. The primary end-point during the management is optimization and maintenance of physiology, keeping in mind the local and systemic effect of the stings and bites. Majority of animal bites and insect stings can be managed on day-care basis after providing supportive v and specific care. The specific management is provided as per the type of bites and stings. At times, bites may look minor but the bite leads to breach in the skin and remains a potential source of not only local manifestations. Generalized infection may occur in bites on extremities with underlying venous and/or lymphatic compromise, bites involving the hand, bites near or in a prosthetic joint, cat bites, crush injuries, delayed presentation, puncture wounds or immuno-compromised patients like diabetes mellitus or those on immuno-suppressants, require prolonged observation. vThe first aid management: For minor bites it includes washing of the wound with ample amount of running clean water along with soap, covering the site with a clean gauze. Consider immunization for rabid bites and tetanus. Direct pressure should be applied to actively bleeding wounds and a neurovascular assessment should be performed in areas distal to the wound. To reduce the counts of bacteria present in the wound, the surface should be cleaned with 1 percent povidone iodine or 1 percent benzalkonium chloride, and the depths irrigated with copious amounts of saline using pressure irrigation. Debridement of devitalized tissue is important to remove any nidus for infection. vpuncture wounds: Present significant challenge to wound care. No wound treatment method has been proven to effectively to reduce contamination or subsequent infection of these wounds. Most research involves the care of plantar puncture wounds caused by stepping on a sharp object rather than puncture wounds caused by bites. The management of these wounds require removal of devitalized epidermal tissue but avoid coring of deep tissues. The wound needs to be assessed for its deep puncture or presence of foreign bodies and contamination. The wound should be washed with copious amounts of running water. The efficacy of soaking puncture wounds in an antiseptic solution (e.g., povidone iodine) is controversial. While some experts suggest that it promotes wound cleansing, others avoid this approach because of the potential to delay wound healing. We suggest soaking puncture wounds in an antiseptic solution for up to 15 minutes after the above steps are performed. vprimary closure: The approach to wound closure varies according to site and type of bite. A clinician with prior training and experience in laceration repair may perform primary wound closure of simple lacerations due to dog bites. In contrast, most cat or human bites are left open to heal by secondary intention. However, when cosmetic is paramount (e.g., facial lacerations), the experienced clinician may choose to repair these wounds as well, especially when wound is clinically uninfected, less than 12 hours old (24 hours on the face) and not located on the hand or foot. Appropriate cleaning of wound site is paramount to prevent infection due to contamination. In cases, wherein primary closure is warranted, ensure optimal rinsing and irrigation of the wound prior to its closure. These Lesson 15: Miscellaneous Emergencies :Bit es ,Stings and Foreign Bodies 261patients would require prophylactic antibiotic therapy, and close follow-up to look for any morbidity at the earliest. Wounds at high risk for the development of infections like crush injuries, puncture wounds, bites in hand and foot, immuno-compromised patients, should not be closed primarily. Such wounds should be irrigated copiously, dressed, left open to drain, and examined daily to detect signs of infection. Thus, primary closure of bite wounds in cosmetically important regions is appropriate. However, the clinician should ensure that the patient and/or caregiver understands that there is an increased risk of infection, even when prophylactic antibiotics are provided. Some physicians choose to leave bite wounds open for drainage and possible delayed primary closure 72 hours after the injury. Wound cleansing and debridement of devitalized tissue should still occur during initial care, and the wound should be dressed with wet saline dressings twice daily until closure is performed. Surgical consultation: v A surgical consult needs to be taken once life-threatening events have been optimized. Surgical consultation is usually necessary for deep wounds that penetrate bone, tendons, joints, or other major structures, complex facial lacerations, associated with neurovascular compromise, associated with complex infections (e.g., abscess formation, osteomyelitis, or joint infection). vAntibiotic prophylaxis: Prophylactic antibiotics reduce the rate of infection due to some animal bites, especially cat bites. Although routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended, prophylaxis is warranted in certain high-risk wounds: Deep puncture wounds (especially due to cat bites). \u0090 Moderate to severe wounds with associated crush injury. \u0090 Wounds in areas of underlying venous and/or lymphatic compromise. \u0090 Wounds on the hand(s), genitalia, face, or in close proximity to a bone or joint (particularly the \u0090 hand and prosthetic joints). Wounds requiring closure. \u0090 Bite wounds in compromised hosts (e.g., immuno-compromised, absent spleen or splenic \u0090 dysfunction, and adults with diabetes mellitus). Tetanus and rabies prophylaxis: v The rabies may occur after bites, scratches, abrasions, or contact with animal saliva via mucous membranes or a break in the skin. Early wound cleansing remains essential. However, timely administration of rabies immune globulin and vaccine is also paramount. SPECIFIC bITES: dOg, mONkEy aNd Ca T assessment Age of the victim, local examination needs to be done including bite marks, puncture wounds, scraped skin, presence of bleeding, local swelling, redness, and pain. Ask for history of allergy, vaccination status of the victim, can the animal be observed and the animal's vaccination status if known. vaccination will be required if 1. The bite was from: Wild or stray animal. v Animal not vaccinated/ vaccination status not known. v Animal acting strangely in the recent past. v Unprovoked animal. v 2. Bite has broken the skin. 3. Bite on face, head, neck, hand, foot or near a joint. 4. Bite or scratch becomes red, hot, swollen, or increasingly painful. 5. Person has not had tetanus prophylaxis in last 5 yrs.Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 262 Lesson 15: Miscellaneous Emergencies :Bit es ,Stings and Foreign Bodiesmanagement Ensure the safety of the person and self from the bite again from the animal. Use universal precaution before attending the bitten patient. Flush the wound immediately with running clean water for 10-15 minutes. Wash should also be ensured even if person gets a lick, scratched, or abraded from the animal. Bleeding, if any, needs to be stopped with direct pressure. Cover the wound with dry clean gauze after washing with soap and povidine iodine. Antibiotics, tetanus and rabies prophylaxis needs to be administered as appropriate. All these patients should be referred to higher centres for further management. post Exposure prophylaxis should begin with immediate thorough cleansing of all wounds with soap and water. If available, a virucidal agent (e.g., povidine-iodine solution) should be used to irrigate the wounds. In not previously vaccinated individuals: Use Human Rabies Immunoglobulin (HRIG). Administer 20 IU/ kg body weight. If anatomically feasible, the full dose should be infiltrated around and into the wound(s), and any remaining volume should be administered at an anatomical site, intramuscularly, distant from vaccine administration. Also, HRIG should not be administered in the same syringe as vaccine. Because RIG might partially suppress active production of rabies virus antibody, no more than the recommended dose should be administered. Human Diploid Cell Vaccine (HDCV) or Purified Chick Embryo Cell Vaccine (PCECV) 1.0 ml, IM (deltoid area), 1 each on days 0, 3, 7 and 14. In previously vaccinated individuals: HRIG should not be administered. HDCV or PCECV 1.0 ml, IM (deltoid area), 1 each on days 0 and 3 should be administered. bITES: SNakE Snake bites are seen in certain areas of India with adjoining forest areas and in fields. Approximately 50-70% of snake bites is venomous and need immediate management. Assessment: If a person is bitten by a snake, the patient needs to be assessed for bleeding, swelling, bruising, pain, numbness, weakness, confusion, affected vision or speech, nausea, vomiting, difficulty in breathing and hemodynamic instability. Snake bites may cause specific symptoms based on specific venom. Evidence of systemic envenoming Evidence of coagulopathy: Primarily detected by 20WBCT or visible spontaneous systemic bleeding from gums. Haemotoxic effects including bite- raised Ratio (INR) on laboratory testing. Evidence of neurotoxicity: Ptosis, external ophthalmoplegia causing diplopia, muscle paralysis causing inability to lift the head, respiratory paralysis, distal muscle paralysis etc.other determinants: Cardiovascular abnormalities like hypotension, shock, cardiac arrhythmia, abnormal ECG. Persistent and severe vomiting or abdominal pain. Local envenomation: Severe Current Local envenomation is seen as severe local swelling, bites on the digits, rapid extension of swelling. May present with muscle pain or tenderness with Creatinine Kinase (CK) >1000 U/L, myoglobinuria and renal failure. At times, patients may also present with sudden collapse, convulsions and even cardiac arrest. 20 minute Whole blood Clotting Test (20 WbCT) Considered the most reliable test of coagulation and can be carried out at the bedside without specialist training. It can also be carried out in the most basic settings. It is significantly superior to the 'capillary tube' method of establishing clotting capability and is the preferred method of choice in snakebite. A few milli litres of fresh venous blood is placed in a new, clean and dry glass vessel and left at ambient temperature for 20 minutes. The vessel ideally should be a small glass test tube. It is important that the Lesson 15: Miscellaneous Emergencies :Bit es ,Stings and Foreign Bodies 263tube is clean, glass and dry as the mechanism under review is the contact clotting mechanism. The use of plastic bottles, tubes or syringes will give false readings and should not be used. The glass vessel should be left undisturbed for 20 minutes and then gently tilted, not shaken. If the blood is still liquid then the patient has incoagulable blood. The vessel must not have been washed with detergent as this will inhibit the contact element of the clotting mechanism. The test should be carried out every 30 minutes from admission for three hours and then hourly after that to establish if envenomation is present. If incoagulable blood is discovered, the 6 hourly cycle will then be adopted to test for the requirement for repeat doses of Anti Snake Venom. general Management: The patient with suspected snake bite should be immediately transferred to a medical care facility after immobilization of the affected body part. The application of tourniquets and cuts at the bite site is not warranted. Ensure the safety of the person and self from the bite. Give high-flow oxygen via face mask and watch for any signs of airway compromise. Check for conscious levels including airway, breathing and hemodynamics. Support respiration, if patient has difficulty in breathing. Other supportive measures, like wound cleansing, are also essential. Secure intravenous line and support circulation if compromised. The bite with venomous snake would require treatment with anti-venom and tetanus prophylaxis. Snake bite Treatment Protocol Severe pain at the bite site can be treated with paracetamol. Adult dose of 500-1000mg 4-6 hourly. v Paediatric dose 10mg/kg every 4-6 hourly orally. Avoid NSAIDs and Aspirin. v Care must be taken when removing tight tourniquets which are actually not recommended, sudden v removal can lead to a massive surge of venom leading to neurological paralysis and, hypotension due to vasodilation, so be ready to treat. Anti Snake Venom (ASV) is the mainstay of treatment of definitive envenomation: The ASV available in India is polyvalent i.e. it is effective against all the four common species; Russell's viper, Common Cobra, Common Krait and Saw Scaled viper. Unbound, free flowing venom, can only be neutralised when it is in the bloodstream or tissue fluid. dose of aSv Children receive the same ASV dosage as adults. The ASV is targeted at neutralising the venom. v Snakes inject the same amount of venom into adults and children. vMode of Administration ASV , it can be administered ways: Intravenous Injection: \u0090 reconstituted or liquid ASV is administered slow intravenous injection. (2ml/ minute). is body weight of isotonic saline or glucose. All ASV to be administered over 1 hour at constant speed. The patient should be closely monitored for 2 hours. Perform a 20WBCT and determine if any coagulopathy is present. If coagulopathy is present, v administer ASV . If no coagulopathy is evident treat renal failure by reference to a nephrologist and dialysis. In the case of neurotoxic envenoming where the victim is evidencing symptoms such as ptosis, v respiratory failure etc, it is probably wise to administer 1 dose of 8-10 vials of ASV to ensure that no unbound venom is present. However, at this stage it is likely that all the venom is bound and respiratory support or normal recovery will be the outcome. vASV Reactions: Anaphylaxis with ASV may be life-threatening. This is one of the factors contributing to reluctance on the part of PHC doctors in giving ASV . vASV Administration: ASV is recommended to be administered in the initial dose Neurotoxic/ Anti Haemostatic 8-10 Vials. The patient should be monitored closely for nausea, vomiting, urticaria, itching, fever, chills, v tachycardia, hypotension, diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, bronchospasm and angio-oedema.Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 264 Lesson 15: Miscellaneous Emergencies :Bit es ,Stings and Foreign Bodies If anaphylaxis is evident: v ASV will be discontinued. \u0090 0.5mg of 1:1000 adrenaline will be given IM for adults. Children are given 0.01mg/kg body \u0090 weight of adrenaline IM. In addition, to provide long-term protection against anaphylactoid reaction, 100mg of \u0090 hydrocortisone and an H1 as be used at 22.5mg IV (or Promethazine HCl can be used at 25mg IM) will be administered IV. The dose for children is of Pheneramine maleate at 0.5mg/kg/ day IV or Promethazine HCl can be used at 0.3-0.5mg/kg IM and 2mg/ kg of hydrocortisone IV. If after 10 to 15 minutes the patient's condition has not improved or is worsening, a second dose of 0.5 mg of adrenalin 1:1000 IM is given. This can be repeated for a third and final occasion but in the vast majority of reactions, 2 doses of adrenaline will be sufficient. If there is hypotension or hemodynamic instability infuse IV fluids. Neurotoxic Envenomation: Neostigmine is an anticholinesterase that prolongs the life of acetylcholine and can therefore reverse respiratory failure and neurotoxic symptoms. It is particularly effective for post-synaptic neurotoxins such as those of the Cobra. There is some doubt over its usefulness against the pre-synaptic neurotoxin such as those of the Krait and the Russells Viper. However it is worth trying in these cases. Neostigmine Test: In the case of neurotoxic envenomation the 'Neostigmine Test' will be administered. This test involves administration of 1.5-2.0 mg of Neostigmine IM, together with 0.6mg of atropine IV . The paediatric Neostigmine dose is 0.04mg/ kg IM and the dose of atropine in 0.05mg/kg. The patient should be closely observed for 1 hour to determine if the Neostigmine is effective. The following measures are useful objective methods to assess this:Single breath count. Millimeters of Iris uncovered (Amount covered by the descending eyelid) Management: ASV can be restarted slowly for 10-15 minutes, keeping the patient under close observation. Then the normal drip rate should be resumed: ASV strategy will be based around a six hour time period. When the initial blood test reveals a v coagulation abnormality, the initial ASV amount will be given over 1 hour. After 6 hours a further coagulation test should be performed and a further dose should be administered in the event of continued coagulation disturbance. This dose should also be given over 1 hour. CT tests and repeat doses of ASV should continue on a 6 hourly pattern until coagulation is restored, unless a species is identified as one against which Polyvalent ASV is not effective. The repeat dose should be 10 vials of ASV . 20 vials is the maximum dose of ASV that should be given to a neurotoxically envenomed patient. v Once the patient is in respiratory failure, has received 20 vials of ASV and is supported on a ventilator, ASV therapy should be stopped. Indian ASV has a half-life of over 90 hours. v What should the clinician do after say, 30 vials have been administered and the coagulation abnormality v persists? At this point the clinician should consider whether the continued administration of ASV is serving any purpose, particularly in the absence of proven systemic bleeding. At this stage the use of Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) or factors can be considered, if available. Referral Criteria The key criteria to determine whether respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation is likely, is the 'neck lift'. Neurotoxic patients should be frequently checked on their ability to perform a neck lift. If they are able to carry out the action then treatment should continue until recovery in the Primary care institution. If the patient reaches the stage when a neck lift cannot be carried out then the patient should be immediately referred to a hospital with a mechanical ventilator. The patient should be kept under close observation for at least 24 hours to rule out late onset envenomation. Lesson 15: Miscellaneous Emergencies :Bit es ,Stings and Foreign Bodies 265Refer the patient to a higher centre equipped to support long term ventilation and bleeding disorder and get full blood count (FBC), urea, electrolytes and coagulation profile including INR, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and fibrinogen. Assess urine for protein, haemoglobin and myoglobin estimation. An electrocardiogram (ECG), chest radiograph (CXR) and spirometry in significant envenoming may be helpful. Patient should be monitored with a cardiac monitor and pulse oximeter. INSECT STINgS Usually insect stings would be associated with local reaction confined to the area of the sting. However, at times, these may become life-threatening, specially when a systemic response like anaphylaxis occurs in response to stings and requires immediate medical care. Assessment: Ensure safety of patient and self by removal from the site. After assessing and managing life- threatening events, assess for pain, swelling, redness, rash or itching. At times, an allergic reaction is manifested which may be localized or systemic. Patients with systemic allergic reactions manifest with rash, itching, wheezing, difficulty in breathing, hoarseness of voice, dizziness or feeling faint, difficulty in swallowing, swelling on face, lips, nausea, vomiting, agitation and anxiety. Local pain predominates and may be followed by a severe anaphylactic reaction causing laryngeal oedema, bronchospasm, hypotension and collapse. Action: Observe all patients in the resuscitation area, assess and secure the airway, and administer oxygen. Gain intravenous access, especially if anti-venom is also indicated. The sting may be removed manually. Provide supportive care as per manifestations. In case, patient becomes unconscious, provide resuscitation as learnt in the NELS approach. In cases of anaphylaxis, \"ABCDE\" needs to be managed immediately. The use of intravenous 1 in 1000 adrenaline (epinephrine) 0.3-0.5 mg (0.3-0.5 mL) is warranted as discussed in circulation chapter. FOREIgN bOdIES The foreign bodies may be lodged in the eye, nose, ear and respiratory tract. Eye Types of foreign bodies in eye may be dust, wood splinters, metal particles, eye lashes or insects. Assessment: Foreign bodies cause discomfort ranging from redness, pain, and even impact on the vision. These are also potential source of infection. The possibility of intraocular penetration, with any high velocity injury, e.g. by a metal fragment from drilling or hammering, or a stone exists. So, an ophthalmologist opinion is always warranted. The conjunctival foreign body may be obvious, or revealed by fluorescein staining. Action: Avoid the rubbing the eye. The eye should be rinsed with copious clean water for at least 10-15 minutes. An ophthalmologist consult to locate the foreign body and its early removal is warranted. Avoid any blind removal of the foreign body, if not directly visible. The use of antibiotics should be as per ophthalmologist opinion. Ear Foreign bodies like wooden pieces, beads, cotton plugs, insects may be lodged in ear and may damage the tympanic membrane. Assessment: Patient may complain of pain, itching, hearing impairment, ear bleeding, sense of dizziness, or tinnitus. Action: The blind removal should be avoided. An Otorhinolaryngologist should be referred for removal under direct vision. In case insect is suspected, use of tepid clean water in ear may make the insect float out. Nose The foreign body in nose is seen in children introduced either accidently or inserted by themselves.Provider Course Manual: Na tional Emergency Life Suppor t 266 Assessment: The patient usually a child may present with crying, swelling, bleeding and pain in the nose. Action: Avoid inserting anything blindly in nose for removal of the foreign body. Ask the patient to breathe comfortably through the mouth. An Otorhinolaryngologist should be referred for removal under direct vision. bIblIOgRaPhy 1.
