The health effects of interacting with nature are well-documented. People who have access to nature experience lower mortality rates, lower healthcare costs, and better physical and mental health. During the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, access to National Forest System lands provided significant contributions to the health and well-being of people and communities. The pandemic also increased the visibility of the people who work on our national forests and grasslands. Based on these contributions, this first-of-its-kind toolkit discusses ways to create innovative partnerships between our national forests and healthcare organizations. In it, you will learn how to develop programs that help expand the benefits we as land managers can provide to our communities, especially through encouraging participation by groups that have traditionally been underrepresented in outdoor recreation. As part of our mission, and in support of our Equity Action Plan, we can help communities realize the potential of recreation as a driver to support healthy societies, strong local economies, thriving outdoor places, and equitable outdoor recreation opportunities. Because partnerships make us stronger, it is our responsibility to seek out partners to help share the rejuvenating effects of nature on our national forests and grasslands. This easy-to-use toolkit will help you develop those partnerships and establish paths for those who may need connection to the land the most. I hope you find the information both helpful and inspirational; this work has the power to improve lives. Chief Randy Moore RAND Y MOORE Chief, USDA Forest Service 1Foreword This simple yet powerful belief, now gaining traction within scientific research and the medical community worldwide, led three National Forest System units to develop partnerships with local healthcare organizations. U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Forest Service employees partnered with local healthcare professionals to create programs enabling individuals to improve their own health by spending time in nature. This toolkit documents the journey the Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest in Georgia, the Hoosier National Forest in Indiana, and the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit in California and Nevada took in establishing partnerships with local healthcare organizations to create programs connecting individuals with nature. It summarizes the r esearch that establishes the health benefits of spending time in nature, presents tools any Forest Service employee can use to establish a partnership on their own forest, and candidly discusses the successes and failures each unit encountered while establishing their own, unique partnerships. The goal of this toolkit is to demonstrate why these partnerships are so important and provide Forest Service employees the tools and resources to establish their own relationships with local partners. Put simply, we have seen these programs change lives and hope other forests across the Nation benefit from these examples. -Signed, USDA Forest Service employees and healthcare professionals in Georgia, Indiana,California, Nevada, and Washington, DC.Time in nature leads to increased physical and mental well-being.

It might even be the main reason you decided to work for the Forest Service. Today, scientific research supports the understanding that being in nature is beneficial for our health. As managers of roughly 30 percent of public lands in the United States, Forest Service employees have the opportunity to become leaders in connecting the public to the health benefits spending time in nature produces. Traditionally, our reach has been limited to those already visiting national forests; however, we can increase our impact by partnering with healthcare organizations to reach people in the medical system who could benefit from time outdoors as part of their healing and recovery as well as explain the health benefits from spending time outdoors to the general public. Recognizing this opportunity, in 2016, the Forest Service's Office of Recreation, Heritage, and Volunteer Resources established a $20,000 grant to spearhead pilot projects across the agency. The grant gave three forests the funds necessary to establish partnerships with local healthcare organizations and design programs to get the public outdoors. Three units received these competitive funds to establish unique healthcare partnership programs targeting various sectors of the public and presenting different program activities on the Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest in Georgia, the Hoosier National Forest in Indiana, and the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit (LTBMU) in California and Nevada. The L TBMU, managing Federal and public lands ar ound Lake Tahoe in California and Nevada, partnered with a local hospital, Barton Health, with the goal of providing \"wellness outings\" for Barton Health patients and other community members. In 2016, the LTBMU officially entered into a cooperative community wellness partnership with Barton Health and by 2017, the LTBMU and Barton Health were successfully leading health outings on National Forest System (NFS) lands. Physicians, nurses, and others in the healthcare field worked directly with the Forest Service to lead and facilitate wellness outings for individuals with chronic illness, in recovery from major surgeries, at-risk youth, and minority populations.The Cha ttahoochee-Oconee also received funds from the Office of Recreation, Heritage, and Volunteer Resources to expand an existing health partnership on their forest, unlike the LTBMU which used the funding to establish a new partnership. In 2012, the forest partnered with Casting for Recovery (CfR), a national organization which provides outdoor retreats for women combating breast cancer. During these retreats, participants learn to fly fish in order to find inspiration, discover renewed energy for life, and experience healing connections with other women in nature. Chattahoochee-Oconee public affairs staff began partnering with CfR to provide local guidance and photography services during the retreats. Then, when the Chattahoochee-Oconee received the grant funds in 2017, the forest increased their partnership with CfR, leading outings with retreat participants on NFS land, providing direct staff support during the retreat, and helping CfR purchase fly fishing rods for future use. Finally, in 2018, the Hoosier began its own healthcare collaboration after seeing the successes of the LTBMU's and the Chattahoochee-Oconee's partnerships. The forest began working with the University of Indiana School of Public Health (which houses the University's Parks, Recreation, and Outdoors Program) to lead wellness outings on NFS land. Working together, the two organizations provided local community members the ability to experience nature through guided outings. Today, all three partnerships continue, positively impacting lives in and around their communities. While there have been difficulties and setbacks, all three units have also seen the benefits these programs have created. Ensuring every individual, no matter their health needs, has the ability and opportunity to experience America's public lands has allowed these partnerships to flourish. From the rivers of Georgia to the rolling hills of Indiana, and the mountains of California and Nevada, collaborating with healthcare organizations has allowed Forest Service employees to share nature with those who might not otherwise have had the chance. 3Diversity , Equity , and Inclusion Public lands and the accessibility they provide to clean air, water, and open spaces are shared rights to which every person in the United States has access. Access to these lands, owned by all Americans, should be free and universal, but serious inequalities\u2014from race to disability to socioeconomic status\u2014distribute these resources unequally. Numerous studies have shown that marginalized communities have unequal access to nature. The United States has fewer forests, streams, wetlands, and other natural places near where Black, Latino, and Asian American people live, while families with children\u2014especially non-White, low-income families with children\u2014have less access to nature nearby than the rest of the country (Landau, McClure, and Dickson, 2020). Additionally, communities of color are three times more likely than White communities to live near nature-deprived places, while 70 percent of low-income communities across the country are in nature-deprived areas (Landau, McClure, and Dickson, 2020). Individuals with physical disabilities or chronic illnesses are also unable to receive equitable access to nature because of both on-the-ground, physical barriers and larger, over-arching societal and institutional barriers (Burns and Graefe, 2007) (Burns, Paterson, and Watson, 2009). Approximately one-quarter of Americans who suffer from a disability are often unable to access public lands, even if they live nearby. This unequal distribution of access to outdoor spaces is a product of racism and discrimination. Even when these groups are given easy access to public lands, they often face additional barriers when they recreate outdoors. As a report by the Center for American Progress notes, marginalized participants in outdoor activities face the risk of being targeted, stereotyped, and harmed for simply enjoying nature and often shy away from spending time in nature due to underrepresentation, systemic racism, and unequal access to knowledge (Rowland-Shea et al., 2020). Fostering access to nature for individuals from demographic groups who have historically not had it is one of the most important tasks Forest Service and healthcare partnerships accomplish. These partnerships help individuals with disabilities, chronic illnesses, and other health impairments access nature. The partnership between CfR and the Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest, for example, enables participants battling breast cancer a safe and guided way to recreate on public land. Both the Hoosier's and LTBMU's wellness outings allowed those recovering from surgery or in hospice care access to nature. Further, these healthcare partnerships have allowed other marginalized communities access to nature. The LTBMU, for example, worked with Barton Health to plan a nature hike for Hispanic youth in South Lake Tahoe, CA, to explore nearby public lands. These partnerships have gone a long way in opening the doors to nature for several underserved demographic groups. By working with local healthcare organizations, these partnerships can allow individuals who otherwise might face significant barriers to access nature and the profound health benefits that spending time outdoors provides.

Hippocrates, the famous ancient Greek physician and called by many the father of medicine, was an advocate for the health benefits of nature, famously stating that \"Nature itself is the best physician .\" Toda y, as human lives, through modernization, have become increasingly indoor-centric, increased scientific attention is being directed toward Hippocrates' idea. In many contexts, research supports spending time outdoors to greatly improve one's health. The current body of research that identifies the wide array of health benefits one can receive from spending time in nature largely began in Japan in the early 1980s. Inspired by Japan 's Forest Agenc y, which began advising people to take strolls in the woods to benefit their health, researchers began to discover that huge improvements were happening during these strolls. In one early stud y, Japanese researcher Yoshifumi Miyazaki discovered that subjects who spent 40 minutes walking in a forest exhibited lowered levels of the stress hormone cortisol than subjects who spent 40 minutes walking in a lab (Miyazaki, 2018). Miyazaki 's research was the first to indicate that a walk in nature was not the same as a walk indoors\u2014the simple act of being in nature created health benefits all on its own. Toda y, hundreds of studies have followed Miyazaki 's lead, discovering that time in nature decreases stress (Ulrich et al., 1997), decreases pain during the healing process (Diette et al., 2003), and lowers the risk of various diseases and ailments (Weller et al., 2020) among other benefits. While this research continues, nearly every study points to the similar overarching conclusion that Miyazaki first discovered, simply spending time in nature, on its own, provides direct health benefits in more ways than we can imagine. Time in Nature Helps Those Diagnosed With ADHD In the United States, there are over 2 million children and 4 million adults that have been diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Research has shown that time in nature can help reduce symptoms of ADHD. In one stud y, conducted by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, researchers found that children who had been diagnosed with ADHD were able to concentrate far better if they took a 20-minute walk in a park\u2014 compared to a neighborhood or urban setting (Faber-Taylor and Kuo, 2009). Likewise, a University of Michigan study found that people diagnosed with ADHD improved their memory and concentration by 20 percent after taking a walk in nature but saw no corresponding increase if they walked in an urban setting (Berman et al., 2008). Other studies reinforced these findings, identifying that those diagnosed with ADHD perform better throughout the day if they take \"green breaks\" (Taylor, Kuo, and Sullivan, 2001) and that they exhibit fewer symptoms relative to the more time they spend in nature (Sifferlin, 2016). Spending time in nature can be especially critical for the roughly 10 percent of people diagnosed with ADHD who do not respond to medication\u2014with some research finding that activity in nature can help people manage their symptoms equally as well as some leading medications (Hallowell and Ratey, 2005). Spending time in nature, many researchers concluded, helped those diagnosed with ADHD because it gives \"... the part of the brain that is used in effortful concentration a rest. If you spend time doing something mentally relaxing, you feel rejuvenated\" (Sifferlin, 2016).

Time in Nature Decreases Stress Stress, the body's physiologic response to real or perceived external threats, in small amounts is a healthy thing. It helps protect us, preparing our body to respond to hazards. However, chronic stress, which has increasingly been shown as widespread across the United States (APA, 2020), can be detrimental to one's health. High levels of stress have been linked to negative health outcomes including cardiovascular disease (Kumari et al., 2011), depression and anxiety (Doane et al., 2013), type 2 5diabetes (Hackett et al., 2014), memory impairment (Lupien et al., 1998), and immunosuppression (Cacioppo et al., 2002). Research has shown that nature can greatly mitigate stress and its harmful side effects. Numerous studies have shown that participants report less stress the more often they visit green spaces and have access to nature (Ran, Das, and Chen, 2011; Stigsdotter et al., 2010; Matsuoka and Sullivan, 2011) while another study discovered that those who viewed scenes of nature directly after viewing a stressful movie reported lower levels of stress than those who viewed scenes of an urban environment (Ulrich et al., 1997). Additionally, studies measuring levels of salivary cortisol, a substance produced when an individual experiences high rates of stress, have found a positive correlation between decreasing cortisol and increased time in nature (Thompson et al., 2012; Van Den Berg and Custers, 2011). Time in Nature Builds Social Cohesion Green spaces, especially within communities, also provide an important role in our physical and mental health by giving us a place to connect with one another and build community. Studies have shown that social cohesion, or the strength of community relationships, creates wide-ranging health benefits (Chuang et al., 2013) and nature has proven incredibly adept at creating social cohesion. Green spaces allow citizens places to recreate together, hold gatherings both big and small, and provide areas for people of varied walks of life to come together. In a study in Australia, for example, researchers found that proximity to parks and outdoors spaces was positively associated with a sense of community (Frances et al., 2012) while a study in Chicago found that those assigned to public housing near green spaces reported more informal contact with their neighbors and closer social connections (Kuo et al., 1998). Time in Nature Helps the Elderly Spending time in nature can also be incredibly beneficial to elderly populations who are statistically more likely to be cut-off from nature than other age groups. Visiting an outdoor green environment has been found to increase elderly concentration and improve mood (Rappe and Kivela, 2005), while older people living in nursing homes were found to display better well-being and higher satisfaction with life by looking from windows with green environments as well as visiting outdoor recreation areas (Brascamp and Kidd, 2004). Spending time in forests was also found to lead to reduced blood pressure and inflammation in the elderly (Mao et al., 2009). A seminal 2006 study with elderly residents who lived in a nursing home identified a strong positive association between the reported frequency of visiting nature and self-rated health, even when considering any hindrances experienced during outdoor visits (Rappe, Kivela, and Rita, 2006). The study found that the main hindrances related to outdoor visits were a lack of assistance and uncomfortable weather conditions but that these hindrances could be easily mitigated and, even with them present, outdoor visits still greatly improved the participant's health and well-being. Time in Nature Helps in the Healing Process Spending time in and around nature has also been shown to help those healing from injuries and recovering from illnesses. A study of patients recovering from gall bladder surgeries randomly placed half of the patients in rooms facing a brick building and half in rooms facing a natural environment. The study found that those facing nature had shorter post-operation stays, recovered faster, and took less pain medicine (Ulrick, 1984). Researchers concluded that viewing nature alone can aid in the path to recovery. Staff from Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit and Barton Health lead a wellness outing near South Lake Tahoe, CA.

In studies, the presence of plants improved pain tolerance and distress among a wide variety of subjects (Lohy and Pearson- Mims, 2000; Park et al., 2004). Patients undergoing bronchoscopies (a common medical procedure that allows a doctor to look at a patient 's lungs by inserting a camera through the patient 's throat) reported significant reductions of pain if they had the views and sounds of nature nearby while they were recovering (Diette et al., 2003). Time in Nature Helps With Depression and Anxiety Spending time in nature has also been linked to bettering one 's mental health. With more Americans living in urban areas lacking access to natural spaces and with depression and anxiety symptoms on the rise, discovering the link between nature and mental health is ke y. A 2015 study compared brain activity of people who walked for 90 minutes in a natural setting to an urban one. The researchers discovered tha t those who walked in nature had dramatically lower prefrontal cortex brain activity\u2014a brain region that is active when experiencing negative emotions (Bratman et al., 2015). Similarl y, a study conducted in Australia in 2016 found that those who spent just 30 minutes a week in outdoor green spaces reduced their risk of clinical depression by 7 percent (Shanahan et al., 2016). An even shorter amount of time in nature, 5 minutes, researchers from the University of Regina concluded, was all the time needed to increase one 's mood (Neill, Gerard, and Arbuthnott, 2019). The stud y, which randomly assigned participants to sit alone in either a natural or indoor location, found that those who spent their 5 minutes outside reported far greater rates of hedonic moods (emotions associated with comfort and pleasure) and self-transcendent emotions (including feelings of awe, gratitude, and wonder). Time in Nature Decreases Cancer Risk Some of the most surprising research to come out of the nature-health interface has been the finding that spending time in nature can decrease one 's risk of cance r. In 2009, Japanese researchers discovered that spending time outdoors in green spaces led to an increase in NK cells, a type of white blood cell that supports the immune system and is associated with a lower risk of cancer (Li, 2009). In one stud y, people who had been involved in a weekend trip to a forest displayed increased levels of NK cells for over 30 days after their nature outing. Likewise, in a follow up study, researchers found that people who took two long walks through forests on consecutive days increased their NK cells by 50 percent and the activity of these cells by 56 percent (Sifferlin, 2016). Those activity levels remained 23 percent higher than usual for the month following the walks. Time in Nature Lowers Blood Pressure and Decreases the Risk of Heart Attack While it is well-known that exercising lowers blood pressure and decreases the risk of heart attacks, recent studies have shown that exercising outside can improve these health benefits even more. One study found that those who exercised outdoors displayed lower blood pressure than those who performed the same level of exercise indoors. Even participants who ran on a treadmill while looking at pictures of nature had lower levels of blood pressure than those who ran on a treadmill without viewing these pictures (Pretty et al., 2005). Additionally, other research has reported \"evidence demonstrates that contact with nature positively affects blood pressure and cholesterol\" (Godbey, 2009), while a 2014 study found that simply being exposed to sunlight lowered blood pressure and reduced the risk of heart attacks and strokes (Weller et al., 2020). Walking in nature is incredibly beneficial, both lowering blood pressure and promoting overall health. Studies have found that people who walk outside 15-30 minutes a day are healthier than people who do not\u2014they have fewer diseases, reduced cancer risk, have a lower risk of heart attack and stroke, and have better bone density (Hartman, 2006). Summary There is a strong body of research that connects time outside in green spaces with improved health. Hundreds of studies have positively correlated time in nature with decreased anxiety, lowered blood pressure, reduced stress, and better overall health\u2014to name just a few benefits. The power of nature in contributing to healthy, full lives cannot be underestimated. All people should have access to the benefits of nature and those areas and green spaces should be a priority for all, no matter their age, socioeconomic status, or living environment. As Forest Service employees, we can play a key role in helping members of the public, no matter their background or health condition, receive the vast array of health benefits that spending time in nature provides. 7Pilot Project 1: Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit In the spring of 2015, Barton Health, the main nonprofit healthcare provider in the Lake Tahoe Basin, undertook a survey to identify critical health needs in the community of South Lake Tahoe, CA. After gathering responses from more than 400 area residents, Barton discovered that chronically ill and minority populations in South Lake Tahoe were at heightened risk for isolation, increased injury rates, and health and wellness deficits. In response, Barton Health reached out to the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit (LTBMU) proposing an innovative partnership: working together to provide guided access to public lands for the at-risk populations identified in the survey. Agreeing, the LTBMU and Barton Health began laying the groundwork for their partnership and, by 2016, the two organizations formally entered into a cooperative community wellness partnership. The partnership was centered around four different pillars: Community Wellness Outings: Leading guided wellness outings on NFS land to allow at-risk populations access to the health benefits from being in nature. Partner-driven Accessibility: Capturing feedback from participants of the wellness outings to better address and enhance accessibility on NFS lands. Preventative Medicine and Wellness Training: W elcoming Barton Health professionals to provide health-care training to LTBMU employees. Research Methods: Studying the health benefits of being in nature that the program sought to provide. In the fall of 2016, the partnership officially kicked off when the LTBMU and Barton Health hosted a wellness walk for chronically ill community members at the LTBMU's Taylor Creek Visitor Center. This trial wellness outing set the stage for five more wellness walks during 2017. In the late winter, Barton Health and the LTBMU hosted the first of the five additional wellness walks, holding a moonlight snowshoe for orthopedic patients on the southern shore of Lake Tahoe. During the summer of 2017, the two organizations hosted four more wellness walks at various Forest Service locations, targeting youth with emotional and behavioral challenges, Spanish-speaking youth, chronically ill locals, and full-time nursing home patients.

At each walk, professionals from both organizations attended and shared information, with Barton Health employees speaking on medical benefits and LTBMU employees providing details about the natural settings the walks were occurring in, both ensuring safe access for participants. In late 2017, finishing off the season, Barton Health and LTBMU employees traveled to Washington, DC to share their partnership success at an outdoor recreation conference. In 2018, Barton Health and the LTBMU continued hosting wellness outings while accomplishing tasks outlined under the other pillars of their partnership. Over the course of the year, the two organizations hosted six different wellness outings. These outings were once again targeted to specific at-risk populations in the local community and involved both Barton Health and LTBMU staff members. In 2018, the LTBMU also invited Barton Health to provide direct health services to Forest Service employees. Barton Health employees hosted a field-going foot-care clinic for both LTBMU employees and the general public, facilitated a morning yoga event at a forest-wide meeting, and supplied nutritional protein power bites to the LTBMU's Tallac Hotshots fire crew. The two organizations also continued their efforts to share the research and benefits gathered from hosting wellness outings, publishing findings in local news outlets, and sharing the concept of their partnership with the rest of the NFS. The death of the main leader of the partnership at Barton Health along with staffing changes at LTBMU caused the 2019 season to be severely limited, and while plans began to renew the partnership in 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak cut short those efforts as well. Today, planning efforts are underway to restart the partnership and physical wellness outings since the pandemic has subsided. The LTBMU and Barton Health celebrated the finalization of a new 5-year partnership agreement on July 27, 2022, and both organizations are busy planning new wellness outings for the future.

Founded in 1996 by a breast-reconstruction surgeon and a professional fly fisher, the organization recognized that women with breast cancer needed innovative ways to build support groups as well as experience renewed energy by connecting with nature. Because of that, CfR began offering retreats where women with breast cancer came to learn to fly fish. Not only did the act of casting a fly rod back and forth match the necessary physical therapy required for those coming out of radiation as part of their treatment, the simple act of being in nature, CfR found, also allowed the women even greater health benefits. In 2012, CfR began hosting a two-and-a-half-day retreat at Woods State Park, a park that borders the Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest and includes Dukes Creek, one of the premier fly-fishing locations in the Southern United States. Following the retreat's first year, public affairs staff from the Chattahoochee-Oconee began collaborating with CfR to provide local guidance and photography services.

When the Chattahoochee-Oconee received the national-level Forest Service grant in 2017, the forest worked to expand their partnership with CfR. In the spring of 2017, the two groups began meeting to understand how the Forest Service could best support and advance the work CfR was already accomplishing. Together, the two organizations discovered that the Forest Service could help CfR overcome a major financial burden. For years, the CfR's Georgia chapter had been unable to afford a set of fishing rods that could be used on and around the chapter's annual Georgia retreats. Because of this, CfR had been forced to ship rods from Montana each year, not only creating a financial burden every time they planned to hold a retreat, but also causing headaches with constantly shipping gear across the country. Utilizing part of the money from their grant, the Forest Service was able to purchase 12 fly rods for CfR's Georgia chapter, allowing the nonprofit to own a set of fly rods for retreats years into the future. Additionally, during the 2018 retreat, two Chattahoochee-Oconee employees also worked as river helpers to help keep the participants safe during the retreat and to share insights about the natural world the women were fishing in. At the end of the retreat, the Forest Service welcomed CfR and the retreat participants for a guided hike on NFS land at the Duke Creek Falls recreation site. The hike allowed the participants to spend more time in the forest, enjoying the area, connecting with each other, and soaking in the health benefits of spending time outdoors. Following the retreat, CfR and the Chattahoochee- Oconee held a close-out meeting, celebrating a successful partnership and hoping for continued collaboration in the future. While the COVID-19 pandemic forced CfR to cancel subsequent retreats, staff on the Chattahoochee-Oconee are continuing to collaborate with CfR and are looking for ways to continue to grow the partnership.

Armed with a $6,500 grant, the Hoosier began searching for a partner in their community. Soon, the forest began collaborating with the University of Indiana School of Public Health (IU Health) and began setting the foundation for a partnership. The two organizations decided they would base their partnership primarily around holding community wellness outings\u2014walks in nature focused on health, led by both Forest Service and medical professionals. The Hoosier also brought on an intern, a current student within IU Health to help plan and facilitate the wellness outings. Starting in the summer of 2019, the Hoosier and IU Health began hosting wellness outings. Advertising within Burlington, IN, and surrounding communities, the wellness hikes were open to anyone who wanted to join. Each hike included a healthcare professional from IU Health and Forest Service employees to help guide the hike. Over the course of the year, six separate wellness outings were held on NFS trails with numerous locals coming out to participate in the unique partnership. Participants reported positive feedback from the trips, learning not only about their own health but also how nature contributes to it. Additionally, the Hoosier collaborated with IU Health to provide health benefits directly to Forest Service employees. At three separate staff meetings, healthcare professionals hosted important discussions with topics ranging from mental health to how to lead a healthy lifestyle. The discussions, while not only providing Hoosier employees with important health takeaways, further cemented the partnership between the two organizations. Lastly, the Hoosier hosted IU Health employees and students on the forest for a day of service. Working at a Forest Service-managed horse camp, IU Health employees and students donated their time and resources to remove and construct a new fence at the camp.

Following a successful 2019 season of collaboration, the Hoosier and IU Health sat down to reflect on the year and plan for the year ahead. Most notabl y, the two organizations recognized the importance of continuing to host wellness hikes, but decided to start tailoring these hikes to specific sectors of the local community who could best benefit from the nature outings. Not only would working with a specific at-risk population ensure that those who could most benefit from the wellness outings could participate, but it would also allow IU Health and the Hoosier to tailor each nature hike to the specific attendees. Additionall y, the Hoosier planned to collaborate with IU Health 's Get Onboard Active Learning (GOAL) program, a program which seeks to ingrain health y, active lifestyles within children and families. Togethe r, the two planned to host wellness hikes with GOAL participants, both to showcase the benefits of spending time in nature and to teach families the skills necessary to recreate in nature on their own. The COVID-19 pandemic shut down the program for the 2020 season, canceling all scheduled in-person wellness outings. The Hoosier managed to virtually share the health benefits of nature with community members by circulating a list of trailheads to GOAL families to hike on, but the majority of the planned programming was suspended.

The first step in establishing a partnership on your forest begins with ensuring that there is a need in your community for a health partnership and that one does not already exist within your area. While the LTBMU and the Hoosier realized there was a lack of existing nature/health partnerships on their forests, when the Chattahoochee-Oconee looked to their community for similar existing projects, they discovered that CfR was already present, accomplishing much of the work the forest was hoping to do. Thus, instead of creating an entirely new program, the Chattahoochee-Oconee decided to devote their resources to helping CfR's existing program reach greater levels of success. By partnering with CfR and supporting their ongoing program of work, the Chattahoochee-Oconee was able to create a larger impact by bolstering the existing program rather than competing with it. While it may seem obvious, ensuring that there is a need in your forest's community for a partnership and that no existing organization is currently meeting this need is an important first step. Obtain preapproval from forest leadership. Once you have identified a need in your community and have concluded that creating a new partnership is the best way to help meet this need, it is a great time to seek buy-in from your forest leadership team. Ensuring that you have full support and the resources necessary to pursue a partnership is a critical early step. Identify a partner and propose a partnership. With the background work complete, identify and reach out to potential partners. Depending on your situation, this can be a difficult step. It is often made harder if you are the one outreaching to a health organization that has not conducted work outdoors in the past. While the LTBMU was approached by Barton Health to establish a nature/health program and the Chattahoochee-Oconee was able to partner with CfR who had been working in this realm for years,the Hoosier faced difficulties during this step. Since IU Health had not considered creating a program to take advantage of the health benefits of being outside, the Hoosier had to do a great deal of work to not only convince IU Health about the value of creating a partnership, but also finding people within IU Health who had the time and energy to help lead the project. We also encourage you to think broadly about possible organizations to partner with. The three units highlighted in this toolkit showcase the diversity of partners a forest can partner with, from a hospital to a university to a nonprofit. Outside of these examples, nursing homes, community groups, local volunteer organizations, and State or local public health departments can all be effective partners depending on specific, identified goals. Work with the partner to establish pillars of the partnership. Once a partner organization and a few key personnel at that organization have been recognized, it is important to begin working with your partner to establish the pillars and goals of the partnership. All three units discovered that a crucial first step was to layout the projects' goals. Not only does this allow both sides to have input into what they want the partnership to accomplish, but it allows everyone involved to agree upon a shared vision. Having a strong, shared vision is critical to keeping the relationship and project on track. For example, the LTBMU and Barton Health established the following mission statement to help focus their work: \"The purpose of this agreement is to document the cooperation between the parties to promote, invest in, and utilize National Forest System (NFS) lands and facilities to enhance community wellness, including programs that address nutrition, exercise, stress, and an individual's sense of purpose in accordance with the following provisions and any incorporated supplemental project agreements .\" In addition, LTBMU and Barton Health agreed on the following four pillars to guide their partnership: Community Wellness Outings: Leading guided wellness outings on NFS land to allow at-risk populations access to the health benefits from being in nature. Partner-Driven Accessibility: Capturing feedback from participants of the wellness outings to better address and enhance accessibility on NFS lands. Preventative Medicine and Wellness Training: Welcoming Barton Health professionals to provide healthcare training to LTBMU employees. Research Methods: Studying the health benefits of being in nature that the program sought to provide. 14The Hoosier National Forest and IU Health agreed on the following three pillars to guide their partnership: Community Wellness Outings: Collaborate with IU Health to provide guided wellness outings to the local community on NFS lands. IU Health and Hoosier National Forest Wellness Sessions: Share the expertise of both organizations to provide health discussions for staff members. Research Methods: Provide evidence of the mental and physical benefits of physical activity in nature by sharing the results of wellness outings. With a partner identified, mission statement drafted, and pillars agreed upon, it is now time to move on to the second step in creating an effective program on your unit, ensuring the partnership is fully approved and the resources are in place to begin holding your first events.

Step 2: Receiving Partnership Approval Hold a kick-off meeting with your partner. It is important to hold a formal introductory meeting with all individuals who will play a role in the partnership. Before entering into a formal agreement, ensure that everyone remains committed and excited about the partnership and is able to provide the time, resources, and attention a successful partnership needs to flourish. Identify individuals to serve in key roles. It is recommended that specific individuals' roles are identified during this meeting. While each partnership will have unique roles, clearly assigning roles to individuals helps everyone know who is designated as key staff within the partnership. Some specific roles that all three units found important to identify (but may not be limited to) included: Partnership co-liaisons (typically one individual from each organization) Financial lead Advertising/communication lead Wellness outing leaders (typically one individual from each organization) Grants and agreements lead During this meeting, discussion should also revolve around the specifics of the partnership and what it will look like. Using the pre-agreed upon pillars as a guide, it is important to lay out the specific programming you hope to accomplish through the partnership. For the Chattahoochee-Oconee, this consisted of buying fishing equipment for CfR and assisting during their annual retreat. For the LTBMU and Hoosier, the specific programming consisted of holding a series of wellness outings for at-risk members from the surrounding communities. These discussions will likely take a few meetings to accomplish, so creating a consistent schedule of formalized meetings for the partnership is critical. All three units highlighted in this toolkit held monthly meetings while establishing their partnerships. Formalize the partnership. Once the specifics of the partnership are agreed upon, the next step is to create an agreement to formalize and document the partnership. It is advised that you work with the local Grants and Agreements office to accomplish this step and formalize the required documentation specific to your partnership. The Chattahoochee-Oconee, Hoosier, and LTBMU all used challenge cost-share agreements to formally establish their partnership. Challenge cost-share agreements authorize the Forest Service to cooperate with other parties to develop, plan, and implement projects that are mutually beneficial to the parties and enhance Forest Service activities. The general steps are as follows: Complete and submit an advanced acquisition plan: To create a successful agreement for your partnership, the first step is to complete an advance acquisition plan and submit it in the Forest Service's Work Plan Acquisition Planning module. This helps lay out any estimated costs the partnership might accrue. We recommend reaching out to your forest's budget staff for specific assistance in creating an acquisition plan. 15Link the advanced acquisition project in the Natural Resource Managers (NRM) web page: Linking the project in the NRM web page is an important step because this is where you will create, submit, and accept your project proposal. If you do not have any active NRM roles and have not previously requested projects through NRM, contact your local grants management specialist for assistance. Draft a challenge cost-share agreement (or other formal document as advised by the Grants and Agreements Office): The Forest Service has a template challenge cost-share agreement that provides step-by-step instructions for how to complete it. From the Forest Service's Grants and Agreement landing page, download the challenge cost-share template (the template will help you complete an effective and approvable agreement). See the executed Challenge Cost-Share Agreement between Barton Health and LTBMU for reference. Find it here https://www.fs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/fs-1500-10-challenge-cost-share-agreement-barton-health-2022.pdf Draft a financial plan: Like the challenge cost-share agreement, the Forest Service also provides a fillable template to help you complete a financial plan. This template, FS-1500-18, Financial Plan can also be found on the Forest Service's Grants and Agreement landing page. Complete a cover sheet (if required): Some region's Grants and Agreements team will require you to submit a cover letter in order for your challenge cost-share agreement to be approved. Contact your local grants management specialist for assistance or to see if one is required. Submit documentation to your local Grants and Agreements team: Once you have finalized your challenge cost-share agreement, financial plan, and (if required) cover letter, submit the documents to your Grants and Agreements team for approval. Once approved, you will now have an official partnership in place with the partnering healthcare organization and can begin hosting events and programs. Lastly, communicating with your partner about what type of documentation is needed is crucial; for example, they may want to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). Allowing space for this discussion is important, as both parties will want to be protected legally.

After mutually completing all of the necessary documentation and agreeing upon the vision of your Forest Service and healthcare partnership, you are now ready for the fun part, putting all of that hard work into action! If not already started, now is a great time to begin advertising your partnership. Contact local news organizations to spread the word and coordinate with both your forest's and your partner's marketing and social media teams to promote the partnership. You may even consider inviting media and the public to an official signing ceremony of the challenge cost-share agreement, which is a great way for the partnership to begin gaining public awareness. For example, LTBMU hosted such an event with Barton Health to celebrate the new partnership by publishing a news release and hosting a wellness outing during the official ribbon cutting and signing ceremony. By inviting media and various community stakeholders, the partnership received free promotion, and community members who could benefit from it were given the opportunity to learn about it. Plan and hold your first event. With news of your partnership circulating, turning your attention to planning your first partnership event is the next important step. All three units highlighted in this toolkit reported difficulties inherent in planning the first event yet stressed the importance of getting this step correct. There are a number of important things to keep in mind while planning your first event: Ensure equal collaboration and communication with both partners when planning: It is important to ensure that both partners are contributing equally to the planning and execution of the partnership's first event. Relying too much on one partner may cause the event to fail to live up to its full potential. Ensure key staff members are available prior to scheduling the event: While it may seem obvious, it is important to ensure that key staff members are available to attend and assist each partnership event before a date is established. Not having the right staff members in place to organize and lead a wellness outing can be problematic. Both the Hoosier and LTBMU had a few wellness outings face serious difficulties when key staff members were unavailable to attend at the last minute. Ensure logistics are in place: Well before the event, make sure you meet with your partner to fully think through all the logistics of the event. Ask yourselves if all resources have been addressed and considered depending on the intention for each outing to ensure it is a success: Transportation: Are participants able to transport themselves or do they need healthcare-sponsored transportation? Parking can sometimes be limited and/or remote for certain Forest Service sites. Ensure parking needs are addressed and communicated to healthcare partner drivers and participants. Print out, email, or communicate detailed parking directions ahead of time. Be sure to take the time to think through all of the logistics of your first partnership event. For example, special transportation is often needed (such as vans that are wheelchair accessible) when working with individuals in the healthcare system. Courtesy photo by Barton Health. How costs will be accounted for: Depending on the participants or scheduled time, food may be needed. When hosting youth events, food can be an exciting incentive to offer to increase attendance. Forest Service site or venue entrance fees may be an additional cost. If there is administrative waiving of fees, the Forest Service will need to have arranged this ahead of time. If visiting a non-Forest Service venue and there is a required entrance fee, your partner may be able to assist with covering the cost. First aid kits, nature field guides, and more are common costs affiliated with guided walks. The Forest Service can be responsible for arranging for interpreters to be prepared for each outing and its unique needs. 17A Forest Service interpretive guide leads a wellness outing near Taylor Creek, CA. Courtesy photo by Barton Health. Safety protocols: If the outings are planned to occur on NFS lands, Forest Service representatives need to implement safety protocols prior to the event. Typically, interpretive service tours are hosted by a guide that announces who the guide(s) are, the length of the outing, the content that will be covered, if there are restrooms or water available, how many stops will occur, and where the route starts and ends. The route for the outing needs to be predetermined by the Forest Service and healthcare organization representatives. For example, a nursing facility group may need a route with ADA compliant trails and walkways, whereas a behavioral youth outing may need wide open spaces. You may wish to have participants sign liability waivers. Typically, the healthcare organization will be best suited to oversee the distribution and signing of a waiver. Ask yourself if Forest Service volunteer agreements are necessary? If participants ride in Forest Service vehicles, then they will need to have the form filled out and signed by the Forest Supervisor, prior to the event.If nature and/or health interpretation is needed: What type of event are you planning for? Is it a guided interpreter outing? Or will it be self-guided for the participants to experience the site on their own, without a Forest Service representative? Depending on the size of the group, is there a need for two or more Forest Service interpreters? Ensure planned programs incorporate environmental literacy and stewardship: It is important to ensure the planned outing incorporates current environmental literacy and stewardship information. While the main goal of these programs is for participants to receive health benefits from spending time in nature, an important secondary goal is to provide participants with new insights into the natural settings they are exploring. Having Forest Service staff on hand to describe flora, fauna, and cultural heritage in the area is a great way to share knowledge with participants. On the day of the event, be prepared for unexpected circumstances to occur. While we hope your first event goes smoothly, all three units experienced things they had not accounted for when holding their first events. Having the staff and resources to overcome unexpected hiccups is crucial. 18Hold an after-action review following your first event. A few days after your first event wraps up, we recommend holding a meeting with the healthcare partner to debrief the event. Think critically about what went well and what could be improved upon for next time. You may also consider sending out a post-event survey to attendees to gauge their enjoyment of the event and gather any suggestions for future outings. While we recommend conducting a short, after- action review after each partnership event, holding a review session after the first event is especially critical. All three units recognized significant areas for improvement following their first events. Taking the time to sit down with their partner, discuss what could have gone better, and formulate a plan for improvement allowed for improved partnership events in the future. Step 4: Continuing Your Partnership Improve your partnership. After completing an event and holding a debriefing meeting, it is important to put any lessons learned into action. The LTBMU, for example, made sure that both Forest Service and Barton Health employees could be available to provide both nature and health interpretation, while the Hoosier and IU Health began to shift to targeting more-specific subsets of their local population. As you continue to host events, continue to promote and publicize your partnership. Outreach examples from the Chattahoochee-Oconee, Hoosier, and LTBMU are found in Appendix 2. Additionally, you may want to pursue grants that are applicable to your partnership. All three units reported financial difficulties associated with conducting effective wellness outings. Applying for\u2014and receiving grants greatly helped the forests have the resources necessary to host numerous events in a season. Hold an end-of-season meeting. After a full season of wellness outings and other partnership events, it is important to hold an end-of-season meeting to reflect upon and discuss the first year of the partnership. During this meeting, both partners should report out on the year's events, including any statistics and data collected, successes and failures encountered, and recommended improvements. Depending on these discussions, you may just have to make minor tweaks to planning your partnership events; if substantial changes are necessary, it is important to reflect those changes in the formalized agreement. Be sure to take the time during this meeting to celebrate the year's successes. It can be fun to hand out awards, present a slideshow of pictures from the events, or just get together over a meal and reflect on the accomplishments! Tentatively plan events for the next year of the partnership. Before partnership activity formally ends for the season, set a plan for next year's events. Ensuring that both partners are still excited and ready to continue the partnership is critical for continued success. Agree upon a date for a kick-off meeting for the next season's events and plan any needed work over the break.

One of the most important takeaways from the three units that spearheaded these partnerships is the need for buy-in from both partners. While the three partnerships began with all partners eager to fully invest in the relationship, outside events caused various partners to be unable to fully contribute to planning and executing partnership events, which caused difficulties and occasional underwhelming outings. When LTBMU started their partnership with Barton Health, both organizations began contributing equally to the partnership. While Barton Health had first approached LTBMU about starting the partnership, LTBMU was fully invited to participate in the planning and development of the partnership's goals and events. However, as time went on, Barton Health began to gradually take control of much of the background work, coordinating much of the promotion for events and became solely responsible for seeking out grants. This became an issue as LTBMU lacked the ability to search for grants themselves, provide specific input on NFS locations to host events, and contribute fully to the partnership events. The LTBMU learned to improve communication in an effort to be more involved in the planning and coordination process. A similar instance occurred with the Hoosier National Forest and IU Health. Because of various personnel and resource issues within IU Health, the Hoosier took a lead role in planning their wellness outings. Without IU Health input, some of the wellness outings lacked effective healthcare interpretation, leaving participants with a strong understanding of the natural environment they were traveling through but without knowledge of the health benefits they were receiving from being outside in nature. While any wellness outing is impactful, the most impactful experiences occurred when both the national forest and the local healthcare organization fully committed to them. In doing so, participants could benefit from the wealth of knowledge both organizations provide. Plan for shifting personnel. A reality of these projects, if they are conducted long enough, is the fact that personnel within both organizations may need to step back from playing a key role in the partnership or may stop contributing altogether. The LTBMU, for example, faced issues when one of the key staff members at Barton Health suddenly passed away; the loss of someone so integral to the partnership as well as the grieving process that followed caused the partnership to quickly lose steam. Once that occurred, it was difficult to get the partnership going again. While we hope this situation does not happen to you and your partnership, it is likely that at some point you will face the reality of a key staff member departure. To avoid running into issues when this happens, it is important to welcome a large number of staff members to participate in planning and conducting events. Having teammates with experience to call on if leaders of the partnership must step away is important. Similarly, it is important for each organization to have individuals willing to step up if key personnel leave the partnership, this will ensure program momentum, even as new staff carry the partnership forward. Make sure resources are available for a long-term partnership. While it can be difficult to think long term when your partnership is just getting underway, ensuring that all involved have both the time and financial resources to devote to the partnership is important. One side lacking the resources to fully invest in a partnership can pose future issues; therefore, as much as possible, all partners should take honest stock of their resources before entering into an agreement. The Chattahoochee-Oconee, for example, kicked off the first year of their partnership with CfR but, due to staffing and financial constraints, was unable to continue the partnership in a major way beyond the first year. While the partnership was still undoubtedly a success, the Chattahoochee-Oconee's case shows that the resources needed to create a lasting partnership are critical. The Hoosier and IU Health's partnership also struggled because staff at IU Health were unable to devote as much time to assisting with wellness outings as they had originally intended. This left many of the wellness outings the Hoosier and IU Health put on lacking enough medical personnel to truly be successful. In all, working with a community healthcare organization to help get local, at-risk populations into nature takes time and money, resources that both partners need to be willing and able to contribute. Target specific populations when conducting wellness outings. The three units highlighted in this toolkit also learned that it was best to target specific populations when planning and conducting wellness outings, as 20opposed to opening up these events to any member of the public interested in joining. For example, when the Hoosier and IU Health first began their partnership, they advertised their health and nature hikes to any member of the local community who wanted to participate. While these first nature outings were successful, having members of the public participate did not allow the Hoosier or IU Health to provide targeted health advice. The LTBMU and the Chattahoochee-Oconee, on the other hand, targeted each event towards a specific population (LTBMU working with nursing home patients, Spanish-speaking youth, orthopedic patients, etc.; Chattahoochee-Oconee working with breast cancer patients). This more-targeted approach allowed both forests to create specific programming that addressed the specific needs of each population. Not only could the unit and its partnering healthcare organization mitigate risk, it could also guide participants to take part in a specific activity that would allow the best use of time. Recognizing the benefits from more targeted nature outings, the Hoosier and IU Health switched to this approach starting in the second year of their partnership. Conduct a risk analysis before hosting events. All three units also learned the importance of thinking through possible risk factors well in advance of choosing a nature outing. Due to the very nature of these events, outings are often most successful when they get populations into nature who may face obstacles to venturing outdoors unaccompanied. Because of this, there are often additional risk factors to plan for, including accessibility, location, weather, and strenuousness. LTBMU and Barton Health, for example, saw the problems that could arise from failing to account for risk factors before hosting a wellness outing. Holding a moonlight snowshoe with local youth who were struggling with behavioral issues, the two organizations chose a beach along Lake Tahoe as the location. While the beach is easily accessible and passable in the daytime, neither the LTBMU nor Barton Health recognized the risks this location would pose at night. The beach contained a large amount of old railroad debris that, especially under a few inches of snow in the moonlight, became very difficult to see. Thankfully, no one was injured on the old railroad parts, but this demonstrates the need to think through as many risk factors as possible before holding a nature outing. While it is impossible to account for all risks, trying to mitigate as many as possible will help create a safe environment for the often-at-risk populations that will be venturing outdoors during your planned wellness outing. Do not shy away from working with additional partners. While partnering with a local healthcare provider is nearly always essential to effectively create healthcare-nature partnerships, other local groups can often be effective partners in these types of organizations. Groups that work with specific, underrepresented populations in the outdoors can often be critical partners to ensure that individuals in t argeted demographics are aware of\u2014and able to participate in\u2014wellness outings or other events. For example, LTBMU partnered with the Lake Tahoe Unified School District to help invite Spanish- speaking community youth to a wellness outing. Be mindful of reaching out to other groups, inviting them to participate in the partnership and utilizing their expertise to welcome new demographic groups into planned programs. Local recreation organizations can also be very effective partners to help expand and improve wellness outings and other programming. These organizations can help provide outdoor equipment to participants as well as additional expertise and resource support. COVID-19 Like much Forest Service programming, all three units had to shut down their partnership activities during the 2020 and 2021 seasons in accordance with COVID-19 pandemic protocols. Holding in- person events with populations that often had underlying medical conditions was not advisable and, as such, planned events were postponed or canceled. While the LTBMU and the Chattahoochee- Oconee National Forest did not hold any programming through 2020 and 2021, the Hoosier National Forest began conducting some programming online. Working with GOAL, a program through IU Health that seeks to encourage healthy lifestyles for children and their families through nutrition, behavior, and physical activity education, the Hoosier distributed maps and directions for suggested hikes that were family friendly on forest system land. All three forests are expecting to restart in-person programming in 2023. 21Conclusion Caring for the land and serving people is the Forest Service motto, and we accomplish that mission by helping to facilitate access to nature and recreation. And yet, we know all too well that many community members suffer from an inability to easily access and experience nature on their national forests. In an effort to address these concerns and open up the health benefits of nature to those who need them most, three NFS units across the country teamed up with healthcare providers to host wellness outings and other events to allow individuals with guided access to public lands. Creating and continuing these partnerships is difficult and takes commitment from both sides. Individuals must be willing to put in the effort to create lasting partnerships, do the legwork to formalize the agreement, and think through all aspects of hosting wellness outings. However, if done successfully, these partnerships can have profound impacts. Many of the individuals who participated in the events on the three units highlighted in this toolkit were suffering from chronic health conditions\u2014some never thought they would have the opportunity to visit the outdoors again. Through the committed work of these partnerships, individuals were able to experience nature once again, allowing them to receive the health benefits being in nature bestows upon us. While this toolkit discusses many of the steps needed to create a similar partnership, not every step is listed and not every scenario is addressed. We encourage you to strike out boldly and begin, while acknowledging there may be setbacks and roadblocks on your journey, knowing the results are worth it. Please reach out to any of the contacts listed in this toolkit as you begin your journey. We hope this toolkit puts you on the right track; that said, speaking directly to other Forest Service professionals who have started similar partnerships may prove even more helpful.

Dedication This guide is dedicated to Dr. Stephen Bannar. Dr. Bannar was an integral member of the Lake Tahoe community as an orthopedic surgeon at Barton Health in South Lake Tahoe, CA. He was one of the original visionaries and sources of leadership, innovation, and energy for the partnership with Barton Health and LTBMU to build stronger connections between healthy forests and healthy people. For years to come, we will continue to dedicate our work to Dr. Bannar to further the LTBMU and Barton Health partnership to its greatest potential. Dr. Bannar's presence was uplifting and motivating, having touched many lives with his amazing spirit, we will miss him as a true healer, believer, colleague, and friend.
