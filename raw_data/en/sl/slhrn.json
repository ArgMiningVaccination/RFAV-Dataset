Bioenergetic therapy, developed by Alexander Lowen, M.D., is based on the principle that the mind and body are connected and that the health or illness of one affects the other. That is, what happens in the mind affects the body, and vice versa. Bioenergetic therapy may be a useful therapeutic approach for people with psychological issues connected to the body, such as anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorders, and phobias. While research is limited on the effectiveness of bioenergetic therapy, therapeutic approaches that integrate the body into the psychotherapy process have shown significant benefits. This article will discuss bioenergetic therapy, the theories behind it, exercises used, finding a therapist, and research into its use. aldomurillo / Getty Images. How Do Bioenergetic Therapies Work? Bioenergetic therapies are based on the principle that the mind and body are connected, and that connection can be explored to relieve physical and emotional tension. Bioenergetic therapy further stipulates that physical and mental health affect one another\u2014what goes on in the mind affects the body, and what happens in the body affects the mind. Put another way, a healthy body feeds a healthy mind, and vice versa. Based on this mind-body connection, bioenergetic therapy integrates bodily functions like breathing, movement, feeling, and expression to relieve physical tension that is thought to contribute to mental distress and hinder the enjoyment of life. According to The Alexander Lowen Foundation, relieving chronic muscular tension is necessary to \"overcome feelings, behaviors, and attitudes that detract from life.\" Bioenergetic therapy operates on the principle that the body can heal itself through this mind-body connection. Bioenergetic therapy may help people with psychosomatic disorders (illnesses that result from stress) and neurotic disorders, such as: Anxiety Depression OCD Panic disorder Phobias A bioenergetic therapist listens to their client and reads their body language (such as gestures, facial expressions, and posture) as they help them explore the connection between their mind and body and subsequently find relief from mental and physical tension. Bioenergetic Therapy for PTSD Bioenergetic therapy may also help people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The Austrian physician and psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich, whose work Alexander Lowen expanded upon to develop bioenergetic therapy, posited that long-held stress and trauma cause chronic muscular tension, which can detract from fully enjoying life. Bioenergetic therapy aims to relieve that chronic stress and tension to improve physical and mental health. Bioenergetic Exercises Bioenergetic therapy differs from more traditional forms of therapy in that it involves both talking and becoming more aware of bodily sensations. Besides the mind-body connection, bioenergetic therapy has three basic principles: Grounding: Being in the present and clearing stagnant energyBreathing: Connecting with the breathVibration: Being able to experience energy without restriction Bioenergetic exercises are designed to help you become aware of muscular tension in different body areas and understand how that physical tension may be a symptom of your mind-body trying to protect itself against past trauma. A bioenergetic therapist will guide a client through various bioenergetic techniques that touch on the above principles based on the client's specific experiences and needs. For example, bioenergetic exercises may combine breathwork, movement, and self-expression (such as art or dance) to work through past trauma. Bioenergetic exercises often include bodily exercises in which intentional movements are made to identify and release physical tension in the body. Furthermore, bodywork is used to recognize physical sensations and connect them to your feelings and past stressful or traumatic events so that you can work through them. Practicing Bioenergetics at Home While some bioenergetic exercises can be practiced at home without a therapist, it's best to consult with a therapist specializing in bioenergetic therapy to learn which exercises would be most beneficial for you, given your experiences and preferences.Some bioenergetic exercises, like supportive contact from a therapist to help you feel grounded, require that a therapist is present with you. Finding a Bioenergetic Therapist When looking for a bioenergetic therapist, be sure to search for therapists that have been certified and trained in bioenergetic analysis, such as through the International Institute of Bioenergetic Analysis or other professional associations for bioenergetic therapy. Therapists trained in body psychotherapy and/or somatic psychology may also provide bioenergetic therapy services. Sometimes, finding the right therapist for you takes time. Many therapists offer a consultation in which you can share what you hope to get out of therapy, and the therapist can talk more about what services they offer and their approach. You might also consider searching for a culturally and linguistically sensitive therapist to help you feel safe and comfortable when approaching bioenergetic therapy. Origins of Bioenergetics Bioenergetic therapy is based on the work of Wilhelm Reich and developed by Alexander Lowen who was a student of Reich's. Lowen developed the theoretical and clinical approaches to bioenergetic analysis in the early 1950s and 1960s. Lowen was passionate about showing the importance of the body in the psychotherapy process and that the mind and body are deeply connected. Bioenergetics is based on the principle that a person experiences the world through their body. To that end, Lowen has been quoted saying, \"If you are your body and your body is you, then it expresses who you are. It is your way of being in the world.\" Looking Ahead: Bioenergetic Research Research is limited on the benefits of bioenergetic therapy, and more research is needed to provide empirical evidence of its effectiveness for mental illness or other health conditions. However, this doesn't mean bioenergetic therapy isn't valid. Research has shown that therapies that integrate the body into the therapeutic process do provide some benefits. For example, a 2013 study found that body-oriented psychotherapy, including movement and grounding techniques, significantly reduced depressive symptoms and may be an effective treatment for people with chronic depression. More research is needed on if and how bioenergetic therapy can be applied to other conditions that involve the mind-body connection, such as chronic pain. Talk to a healthcare provider or mental healthcare provider to see if bioenergetic therapy might be a useful tool for you. Summary Bioenergetic therapy is based on the idea that emotional healing can take place through the release of physical tension. The mind-body connection is at the core of bioenergetic therapy, which highlights that mental health and physical health are deeply intertwined. Bioenergetic exercises involve techniques to increase awareness of physical tension as a symptom of past pain or trauma and work with the body to relieve emotional distress. 6 Sources Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.
