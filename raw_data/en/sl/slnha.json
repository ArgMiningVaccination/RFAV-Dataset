Financial Risks None arising specifically from this report but control measures identi fied in Directorate Operational Risk and Opportunity Registers could have financial or resource implications. Carbon Footprint (Environmental) Implications: Failure to deliver against actions in the Climate Emergency Action Plan and Corporate Carbon Reduction Plan are included on risk registers.

The next formal review of the strategic risk and opportunity register will take place in June 2023, the operational risk register will also be reviewed at this time. Risk registers are however a live document and will be regularly discussed at Directorate Management Teams. Strategic Risk Register - Monitoring Summary The updated strategic risk register is summarised below. The register offers additional information including detail on Key Controls and Sources of Assurance and how progress against mitigat ion will be measured. Strategic Risk Register During this review of the strategic risk register there has been three new risks added, bringing the total strategic risks managed to 22. The new risk relates to funding and governance issues in relation to the Peninsula Sub -National Transport Body and the creation of a Sustainable Drainage Systems (SUDs) Approval body. In addition \"Response to Ofsted Focused Visit to the Front Door does not result in required improvements \" has been added to the register. It is currently reported as amber and will remain on the strategic register until further visits by OFSTED , anticipated to be within the next twelve months. In total there are six red risks. These are shown below; 1 The Council's expenditure exceeds the r esources available to meet that expenditure within the medium term financial plan period (2022/23 -2025/26). 2 Failure to meet statutory duties due to growing volume and complexity of demand for children's social care services 3 A Cyber -attack renders all of the Council's IT inaccessible for an extended period of time therefore impacting on the Councils ability to deliver services. 4 IT supply chain constraints results in increased costs and extended lead times for equipment. 5 Lack of adult social ca re workforce and growing fragility of Adult Social Care Market leading to inability of Authority to meet statutory duties and meet eligible need. 20 Lawful Accounting Treatments in Respect of the Pensions Fund 21 The Government intends to implement Schedule 3 of the Flood and Water Management Act in 2024 and put in place a Suds Approval Body (SAB). Schedule 3 provides a This is highly likely to be introduced from 2024 and will be a risk for the local authority from 2024/2025. No provision has yet been made in the MTFP (which is under review). PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL OFFICIAL Risk Register No. Description Mitigation Previous risk rating Current risk rating Risk Owner 1 The Council's expenditure exceeds the resources available to meet that expenditure within the medium term financial plan period (2022/23 -2025/26). The Council has also taken the following steps to adopt a 5 year MTFP and has adopted a system of monthly financial reporting to Directorate Management Teams, Corporate Management Team, and Cabinet and Quarterly to Full Council, with monthly consideration of directorate level financial issues at each Scrutiny Committee. The Council has introduced a system of d etailed monitoring of the delivery of savings targets so that a view is published monthly in Cabinet reports. This will also include any significant issues which emerge from the cost of living crisis. The Council also holds an annual review of fees and ch arges and has annual and ongoing programmes of work to identify and understand potential savings opportunities. The governance system of the Council - as unpacked in the Annual Governance Statement comprise a rigorous system of financial control. It was o f critical importance to the Council and City that CMT and Cabinet found mitigations to reduce the costs of the Council to fully mitigate the forecast budget shortfalls in future years. The Deputy leader/PFH for Finance is meeting each week with S151 Offic er and Strategic Director for Customer & Corporate Services to review the 2022/23 Monitoring position. In year, at Month 10 the forecast overspend has reduced to \u00a31.318m. At the Full Council meeting 27 February 2023, the revenue and capital budget 2023/24 was approved, including setting the Council Tax charge for 25 25 David Northey PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL OFFICIAL the financial year. The S151 Officer is now ensuring the 2023/24 budget allocations and resource assumptions are incorporated into the 5 year MTFP. Further refinement of the Capital Programme and reports are being reviewed. 2 Failure to meet statutory duties due to growing volume and complexity of demand for children's social care services Additional social work capacity agreed to support effectively delivery of casework. Recruitment is ongoing to some of these posts on a permanent basis. Fostering Project Delivery Plan in place to increase foster carer resource to reduce costs. High cost placement review takes place on a frequent basis each month to ensure all costs closely monitored and reduced. Ongoing rigour in decision making to manage demand via Placement Panel which takes place weekly and overseen by a dedicated service manager with responsibility for reducing costs of individual placements and ensuring timely s tep down. Ensuring action plan milestones are reached via monthly monitoring at Programme Board/ Finance DMT . Service redesign is occurring to ensure an operating model that supports much earlier intervention and prevention of children coming into care wherever possible. 20 20 Sharon Muldoon 3 A Cyber -attack renders all of the Council's IT inaccessible for an extended period of time therefore impacting on the Councils ability to deliver services. LGA Cyber 360 review completed in March - review findings and recommendations due in April.

We are seeking to maximise all opportunities to secure additional funding for economic initiatives including focussing on creating new jobs in the Blue and green economy. The initiatives include: The Plymouth and South Devon Freeport, National Marine Par k. We will continue to maximise all funding opportunities for our city region. 16 16 Anthony Payne 7 Ongoing COVID -19 rates (with potential for further peaks) The key mitigation of vaccination has now reached around 85% (one or more doses) of those eligible. There have been reductions in the mitigations (reduced testing, support payments and legal need for self -isolation) and this has created uncertainty around case rates and the risk of delayed detection of new variants. The longstanding advice to the general public remains in place and is re -emphasised at regular intervals. 16 16 Ruth Harrell 8 Failure to reduce Health Inequalities will mean our poorest residents continue to live shorter lives as well as more years in ill health. Persistent action across the Council is required at many levels to tackle inequalities by addressing the wider detriments of health. Failures of NHS England to provide required capital funding for the West End Health Hub (Cavell Centre) is likely to reinforce inequalities experienced within the City Centre area, the Council continues to lobby government in an attempt to resolve this issue. The Public Health Team and partners continue to work with employers and schools to influence healthier lifestyles. The team continues to embed and promote the national One You campaign across the city. The 'five ways to wellbeing' has been adopted across the City as the single approach to improving mental wellbeing. The work that started in year five on 'people connecting through food' is ongoing with a number of new initiatives developed. Subsequently, Thrive Plymouth Year seven was launched in May 2022 with a focus on Listening and Reconnecting. 16 16 Ruth Harrell PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL OFFICIAL The Local Care Partnership priorities are being refreshed and includes tackling inequalities. Both of these routes bring partners together to understand the issues and the steps needed to tackle health inequalities in the City. In addition to this, to sup port the work of the Council's cross - party Child Poverty Action Plan Working Group, a high level review of the evidence of the impacts of the pandemic on the mental wellbeing of children and young people has been carried out. As already stated, the primar y role of the ODPH and the Public Health Team in particular is now to minimise the impact of COVID -19 in the city therefore protecting most deprived communities from further negative impacts. 9 Increased and sustained pressure on Adult Social Care budget due to increased costs of providing care, growing numbers of people and increased complexity of need. Real time management information Established Review Programme Commissioning Intentions and Commissioning Activity to develop new model s of care Budget containment meetings in place Focus on reviews and reablement to right size packages of care including focused work on 18 to 64's Emergency Plan to cover need to prioritise critical services 16 16 Anna Coles 10 Adult Social Care (ASC) Reforms - There are a number of reforms to ASC that have created significant financial uncertainty in terms of being able to accurately understand the cost, volume and funding that will be made available to deliver these reforms. This risk will continue to be monitored closely as the reform programme progresses. We will assess the impact of Charging reforms on 'trailblazer' local authorities who are early adopters of these reforms. We will continue cost of care exercises locally, including working with our local care market to better understand impact on finance and resources We will continue engagement with Local Government Agency and regional and national groups (such as ADASS) to determine approach to managing all reforms. We will continue to seek to un derstand impacts of all reforms through our established reform programmes, and will consider potential use of Offers and Asks due to cost of new burdens on the service. 16 16 Anna Coles PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL OFFICIAL 11 The Council having insufficient workforce capacity and resilience to deliver the required range of services to meet statutory obligations and administration priorities Targeted support for Children Services - resourcing and capacity Grading review Review of People Strategy for 2024 Recruiting to key chief officer roles Reviewing Recruitment and retention strategy Improving induction processes Reviewing market factor supplements Support for employee wellbeing 15 15 Andy Ralphs 12 The Council not meeting its obligation to keep data secure by failing to adhere to Data Protection Act 2018 Regulations results in loss of trust in the Council and/or financial penalty from the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) Continued roll out staff awareness training to all staff.

Year 1, 2 and 3 CCRPs and CEAPs have been prepared to date, covering the period 2020 -2022. The focus of the CCRP is on the things in the direct control of the City Council; the focus of the CEAP is on the wider things the Council is able to influence as well as some of the climate actions of City partners. The Climate Emergency strategy and action plan process is currently und er review, with a view to making revisions from 2023, providing a more strategic approach.
