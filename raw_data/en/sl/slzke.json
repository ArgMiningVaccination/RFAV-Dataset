For the record, having yellow mucus isn't an instant reason to worry about your health, but it is usually a sign that your [immune system](https://www.self.com/story/can-you-boost-immune-system) has kicked into action to fight against, well, something. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. Ahead, SELF asked experts to break down all the reasons you could be dealing with yellow mucus, [what other mucus colors mean](https://www.self.com/story/what-your-snot-can-tell-you-about-your-health) (because we know you're curious), and when it's time to check in with your doc about it. [What is a doctor](#doctor) First, what is mucus and what does it do? Having some mucus in your nose is pretty important. This slimy stuff helps warm and humidify the air you breathe, [Anthony Del Signore,](https://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/anthony-g-del-signore) M.D., assistant professor of otolaryngology and director of rhinology and endoscopic skull base surgery at [Mount Sinai Beth Israel](https://www.mountsinai.org/locations/beth-israel), tells SELF. This is important because breathing air that's too cold and dry can aggravate your airways, which is why it can [burn like hell to breathe outside in wintertime](https://www.self.com/story/cold-air-breathing-pain). So, even though mucus is kind of gross, it contributes a fair amount to your physical comfort. Mucus is meant to keep you comfortable in another way too: As a vigilant guard on the front lines of your body's biological defense system, [Michael Benninger](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/staff/8652-michael-benninger), M.D., chairman of the [Cleveland Clinic Head and Neck Institute](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/departments/head-neck), tells SELF. Mucus traps foreign invaders that could make you ill, including viruses, bacteria, and [allergens](https://www.self.com/story/common-allergens-to-know). Ideally, little hairlike projections called [cilia](https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/ear,-nose,-and-throat-disorders/biology-of-the-ears,-nose,-and-throat/nose-and-sinuses) then shuffle those invaders to the front of your nose so you [sneeze them out](https://www.self.com/story/why-do-we-sneeze), meaning they can't enter your lungs and make you sick. (This dirty mucus can also slip down your throat, but if invaders get to your lungs, you might cough to clear them out.) Mucus even contains some antibodies to help neutralize germs that can make you sick1, [Justin McCormick](https://umg.rwjms.rutgers.edu/doctor_page.php?phys_id=124576), M.D., assistant professor and division chief of rhinology and anterior skull base surgery in the [Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School](https://umg.rwjms.rutgers.edu/departments/otolaryngology/index.php), tells SELF. So, if you happen to breathe in certain germs through your nose that you already have antibodies to (say, due to a prior infection or immunization from a vaccine), your mucus can go to work right away to deflect it. What does yellow mucus mean, exactly? When your mucus traps potential illness-causing debris, like pathogens that cause [the common cold or flu](https://www.self.com/health-conditions/cold-and-flu), your immune system sends inflammatory cells such as white blood cells to the area to help destroy the invaders, Dr. Benninger explains. It's this inflammatory response\u2014not the agents of infection themselves\u2014that causes the signature shift in mucus hue, Dr. Benninger says. One of the first responders to microbial invaders is a type of white blood cell called a neutrophil. Neutrophils are full of myeloperoxidase2, an enzyme that contains green-colored heme, or iron. When super concentrated, these green neutrophils can make your mucus appear straight-up verdant. But when less concentrated, the mucus appears pale green\u2014which, depending on how your eyes work, might look yellow to you instead. You may also notice that your mucus is a deeper shade of yellow (or looks like it has gone from yellow to green) after several days of being sick, not blowing your nose for a while, or when you wake up in the morning. When mucus sits around in your nasal passages for prolonged periods, these inflammatory cells can build up and tint your mucus more intensely, Dr. Benninger explains. \"The less you clear it out, the more it becomes discolored,\" he says. So, when you've got yellow mucus, you should blow your nose often to clear out any trapped debris and keep things moving. To get a bit more granular, we rounded up the most common (and specific) questions about yellow mucus so you can find the exact answers you need: This is a toughie, Dr. McCormick says. \"It is difficult to rely on the color of mucus to determine viral versus bacterial infection,\" he explains. \"While most people think that discolored mucus is always associated with bacterial infections, this is not always the case. Some people with viral infections may have yellow mucus.\" [COVID-19](https://www.self.com/health-conditions/covid-19-coronavirus) hasn't been around for too long (even though it feels like it), so this hasn't been studied extensively yet. [Neil Bhattacharyya](https://doctors.masseyeandear.org/details/410/neil-bhattacharyya-otolaryngology-boston), M.D., a comprehensive ear, nose, and throat specialist at [Massachusetts Eye and Ear](https://www.masseyeandear.org/) in Boston, tells SELF that yellow mucus \"could be\" a COVID-19 symptom \"but it's relatively rare.\" Anecdotally, he points out that he generally hasn't seen yellow mucus in many patients who have tested positive for the virus. In fact, \"their mucus has been pretty clear,\" he says. Basically, it's possible to have yellow mucus with COVID-19 but far from a guarantee. \"Patients with COVID-19 might develop excessive or discolored mucus; however, not all patients diagnosed with COVID-19 will have these symptoms.\" Yellow mucus may be a sign of a [sinus infection](https://www.self.com/story/sinus-infection-symptoms), but you would likely also have other symptoms, Dr. McCormick says. This includes a signature pain or pressure in your face, a headache, a runny or stuffy nose, postnasal drip (when mucus runs down your throat), a sore throat or cough, and even bad breath that can't be explained by your fragrant dinner, per the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/antibiotic-use/sinus-infection.html) (CDC). \"Generally not,\" Dr. Bhattacharyya says. \"If you have yellow mucus, it means you still have white blood cells that are fighting whatever is actively causing inflammation or infection.\" What do other mucus colors mean? Your mucus can give you a total cornucopia of colors, with shades that go way beyond yellow. Here's a breakdown of what specific shades of snot might allude to: - Clear mucus: Consider this your baseline. When your mucus is clear, everything is likely easy-peasy lemon-squeezy in your nasal passages, [Abbas Anwar](https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/462997-abbas-asker-anwar), M.D., a board-certified otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat specialist) at [Providence Saint John's Health Center](https://www.providence.org/locations/saint-johns-health-center)in Santa Monica, California, tells SELF. - Green mucus: In the same family as yellow mucus, this could be a sign that you have a cold or an infection in your nose or sinuses, Dr. Anwar says. - White mucus: Thick, white mucus can be a sign that your body is starting to fight an infection, Dr. Anwar says. You just haven't built up to the level of yellow mucus yet. - Brown mucus: Brown mucus is usually caused by dried blood, Dr. Anwar says. \"If your nasal passages are really dry, you can have some blood that pools in your nose and throat and dries,\" he explains. Then, when it slowly makes its way out in your mucus, it can look brown. - Pink, orange, or red mucus: This is also a tip-off that you have [light bleeding in your nose](https://www.self.com/story/random-nosebleed-causes), Dr. McCormick says. The potential causes can range from blowing your nose too hard or too often (which can burst a blood vessel) to actually getting hit in the nose, Dr. Anwar says. - Black mucus: Dr. McCormick says heavy pollution can lead to black mucus, while Dr. Anwar points out that smoking can cause it too. \"In rarer circumstances, it can be an indication of invasive fungal infections3,\" Dr. Anwar says. How to get rid of excessive mucus No matter what color your mucus is, you probably want to do your best to clear it out if you're dealing with excessive levels of the stuff. Just note that some of the most common illnesses involving yellow mucus will typically clear up on their own without medication. For example, the [common cold](https://www.self.com/story/when-is-a-cold-contagious) usually lasts 7 to 10 days, according to the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/common-cold/symptoms-causes/syc-20351605). A viral sinus infection typically begins to clear up on its own after 5 to 7 days. A bacterial sinus infection, on the other hand, may last 7 to 10 days, hang around for longer than that, or even worsen around a week in before eventually fading, according to the [Cleveland Clinic](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/killer-sinus-infection-how-to-tell-if-yours-is-viral-or-bacterial/). Antibiotics aren't typically needed to clear up sinus infections, but your doctor can make the best call based on your personal symptoms, the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/antibiotic-use/sinus-infection.html) says. In the meantime, there are a few things you can do at home to get relief: - Try nasal irrigation: [Nasal irrigation](https://www.self.com/story/people-are-obsessed-with-this-home-remedy-for-clearing-a-babys-clogged-nose)involves washing out your nasal passages with some kind of liquid, like a saline solution. \"The best way to get rid of excess mucus is by doing nasal irrigations twice daily with saline,\" Dr. McCormick says. - Drink lots of fluids: Staying well hydrated \"can help thin out that mucus and clear it out easier,\" Dr. Anwar says. If plain water isn't doing it for you, reach for some tea. - Crank the humidifier: A [humidifier](https://www.self.com/gallery/best-humidifiers)releases moisture into the air, which can help thin out mucus and get it flowing better, Dr. Anwar says. - Consider medication: You can use over-the-counter meds and at-home care to manage symptoms of any of the illnesses mentioned above. Methods include anti-inflammatories for pain and fever and decongestants if you have an especially clogged nose, Dr. Benninger says. (You shouldn't use [nasal decongestants](https://www.self.com/story/nasal-decongestant-spray-addictive)that constrict your nasal blood vessels for more than three days, though, as that can cause rebound congestion.) When should see a doctor? What really matters is your accompanying symptoms and how long they stick around, Dr. Benninger says. You know your body better than anyone, so you should take a trip to the doctor if you're feeling unusually horrible. If you feel like your symptoms don't seem to be getting any better after around a week of being sick\u2014say, you have a very [persistent cough](https://www.self.com/story/doctor-persistent-cough), tons of postnasal drip, or a headache that won't quit\u2014that's another sign you might want to check in with a physician, even if that means making a virtual appointment. No matter what's going on, your doctor can help determine the cause of your yellow mucus and get your snot crystal-clear again.
