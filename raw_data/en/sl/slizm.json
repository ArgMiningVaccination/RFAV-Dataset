Frequently Asked Questions - What are the benefits of testing at home? - For years, you needed to visit a clinic or lab to screen for routine care or common concerns. Sitting in a waiting room, having awkward conversations and paying for pricey tests is unpleasant enough for many people to avoid testing completely. This leads to undiagnosed and untreated infections and a greater risk for you and your loved one's health. Test on your terms today with myLAB Box. Home lab testing is the next step in the evolution of healthcare. With myLAB's at home test options, you set your own schedule and test whenever you want for whatever you need.

You won't need to go through the hassle of making appointments ever again.

Home test kits are roughly half the cost of testing at a clinic or a doctor's office and do not require insurance. You can also receive your results faster. If you test in a clinic or doctor's office, it can take weeks for them to get your results back from the lab, review your results, and contact you to discuss your health.

Obviously, you should test if you are experiencing symptoms, but you should also test after a potential exposure. Many infections are asymptomatic which means as many as 80% of people may have no idea they are putting people around them at risk. For our wellness tests - we recommend testing proactively to identify areas of health optimization and adjust your lifestyle before small problems become big issues. The [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/std/prevention/screeningreccs.htm)(CDC) has established some guidelines regarding who should get tested when it comes to STDs. If you are sexually active, we recommend that you get a full panel done at least once a year, but more frequently if you have had unprotected sex or multiple partners. Everyone's situation is unique. If you aren't sure how often you should get tested, it's best to speak to your doctor or reach out to our agents to help you determine what is right for you. - How to choose the right at-home test? - There are many testing options available to choose from. Individual testing kits tests are available and include, they are generally best for people who know or suspect they have been exposed to a particular infection. We also offer combination panel kits that test for multiple infections or wellness parameters with one set of samples. They range from 2 to 14 panels. These are best for people with no symptoms or symptoms that could point to multiple infections or conditions. Combination panels are more cost effective when you are trying to eliminate multiple concerns at once. If you aren't sure, it's best to play it safe by testing with a combination panel.
