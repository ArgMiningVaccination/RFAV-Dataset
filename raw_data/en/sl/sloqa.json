Scientific discussion 2.1. Problem statement 2.1.1. Disease or condition End of December 2019, World Health Organization (WHO) was informed about a cluster of cases of viral pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan, China. In mid -January 2020 the pathogen causing this atypical pneumonia was identified as a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2) and genome sequence data were published. Since then, the virus has spread globally and on 30 January 2020 the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and on 11 March 2020 a pandemic. The pandemic is ongoing despite unprecedented efforts to control the outbreak. According to ECDC, histologic findings from the lungs include diffuse alveolar damage similar to lung injury caused by other respiratory viruses, such as MERS -CoV and influenza virus. A distinctive characteristic of SARS -CoV-2 infection is vascular damage, with severe endothelial injury, widespread thrombosis, microangiopathy and angiogenesis. 2.1.2. Epidemiology and risk factors As of 01 March 2 021, there have been over 113 million confirmed cases of SARS -CoV-2 infection globally with approximately 2.5 million deaths resulting from infection and subsequent coronavirus disease (COVID -19). The majority of infections result in asymptomatic or mild d isease with full recovery. Underlying health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, chronic kidney disease, immune compromised status, cancer and obesity are considered risk factors for developing severe COVID -19. Other risk factors include organ transplantation and chromosomal abnormalities. Increasing age is another risk factor for severe disease and death due to COVID -19. European countries that have established surveillance systems in long -term care facilities (LTCF) have reported that 5 -6% of all current LTCF residents died of COVID -19, and that LTCF residents accounted for up to 72% of all COVID -19 related deaths. Individuals with high risk of exposure to SARS -CoV-2 due to occupation include h ealthcare and frontline workers. 2.1.3. Aetiology and pathogenesis SARS- CoV-2 is a positive -sense single- stranded RNA (+ssRNA) virus, with a single linear RNA segment. It is enveloped and the virions are 50- 200 nanometres in diameter. Like other Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 16/218 coronaviruses, SA RS-CoV-2 has four structural proteins, known as the S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane), and N (nucleocapsid) proteins. The spike protein contains a polybasic cleavage site, a characteristic known to increase pathogenicity and transmissibility in other viruses. The Spike is responsible for allowing the virus to attach to and fuse with the membrane of a host cell. The S1 subunit catalyses attachment to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE -2) receptor present on cells of the respiratory tract, while th e S2 subunit facilitates fusion with the cell membrane. The spike protein is considered a relevant antigen for vaccine development because it was shown that antibodies directed against it neutralise the virus and it elicits an immune response that prevents infection in animals. It is believed that SARS -CoV-2 has zoonotic origins and it has close genetic similarity to bat coronaviruses. Its gene sequence was published mid -January 2020 and the virus belongs to the beta - coronaviruses. Human -to-human transmission of SARS -CoV-2 was confirmed in January 2020. Transmission occurs primarily via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes and through aerosols. The median incubation period after infection to the development of symptoms is four to five days. Most symptomatic individuals experience symptoms within two to seven days after exposure, and almost all symptomatic individuals will experience one or more symptoms before day twelve. Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste and symptoms may change over time. The major complication of severe COVID -19 is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) presenting with dyspnoea and acute respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation. In addition to respiratory sequelae, severe COVID -19 has been linked to cardiovascular sequelae, such as myocardial injury, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy and heart failure, acute kidney injury often requiring renal replacement therapy, neurological complications such as enceph alopathy, and acute ischemic stroke. 2.1.4. Clinical presentation and diagnosis The severity of COVID -19 varies. The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold. Mild cases ty pically recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to recover. Among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to death has ranged from two to eight weeks. Prolonged prothrombin time and elevat ed C-reactive protein levels on admission to the hospital are associated with severe course of COVID -19 and with a transfer to ICU. The gold standard method of testing for presence of SARS -CoV-2 is the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT -PCR), which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments. As this test detects RNA but not infectious virus, its ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited. The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharynge al swab, a nasal swab or sputum sample. 2.1.5. Management The management of COVID -19 cases has developed during 2020, and includes supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and supporting other affected vital organs. Treatment of hospitalised patients encompass anti- inflammatory agents su ch as dexamethasone and statins, targeted immunomodulatory agents and anticoagulants as well as antiviral therapy (e.g. remdesivir), antibodies administered from convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulins. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 17/218 These therapies have shown variable and l imited impact on the severity and duration of illness, with different efficacies depending on the stage of illness and manifestations of disease. While care for individuals with COVID -19 has improved with clinical experience, there remains an urgent and unmet medical need for vaccines able to prevent or mitigate COVID -19 infections during the ongoing pandemic. Especially protection of vulnerable groups and mitigating the effects of the pandemic on a population level are desired. Although three vaccines for prevention of COVID -19 were approved recently, there is still an important need for additional vaccines to meet global demands. About the product COVID -19 Vaccine Janssen (also referred to as Ad26.COV2.S) is a monovalent, recombinant, replication -incompetent adenovirus type 26 (Ad26) vectored vaccine encoding a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) s pike (S) protein. Wild-type adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26) consists of non -enveloped virions, encode the adenoviral proteins. The dsDNA molecule is encapsulated by an icosahedral protein structure. The recombinant Ad26 vector Ad26.COV2.S contains a which encodes a modified full -length SARS- CoV-2 spike (S) protein with stabilizing modifications, i.e. 2 amino acid changes in the S1/S2 junction that knock out the furin cleavage site, and 2 proline substitutions in the hinge region. Following administration of Ad26.COV2.S, the spike glycoprotein of SARS CoV 2 is expressed, stimulating an adaptive humoral and cellular immune response. Ad26.COV2.S is administered intramuscularly as a single dose of 0.5 mL (5x10 10 vp, corresponding to not less than 8.92 log 10 infectious units). Proposed indication: ' COVID -19 Vaccine Janssen is indicated for active immunisation for the prevention of coronavirus disease -2019 (COVID -19) in adults greater than or equal to 18 years of age. The use of the vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.' The same Adenovirus type 26 (Ad26) vector encoding the glycoprotein (GP) of the Ebola virus Zaire (ZEBOV) Mayinga strain has been approved in Europe through Centralised Procedure (Zabdeno, INN: ebola vaccine rDNA, replication -incompetent; Procedure No. EMEA/H/C/005337/0000). Type of Application and aspects on development The applicant requested consideration of its application for a Conditional Marketing Au thorisation in accordance with Article 14 -a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, based on the following criteria: The benefit -risk balance is positive. According to the applicant, the efficacy, immunogenicity and safety data presented in their application suppo rt a favourable benefit -risk profile for Ad26.COV2.S in the proposed cMA indication, i .e. for active immun isation to prevent COVID -19 caused by SARS -CoV-2 in adults 18 years of age. This is based on evidence from the ongoing pivotal Phase 3 study COV3001 which examines the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S in a diverse adult population 18 years of age, including adults 60 years of age. The applicant stated that the results for the primary analysis, performed after at l east 2 months (8 weeks) of follow -up indicate that Ad26.COV2.S is effective against symptomatic COVID -19 and both co -primary endpoints of the study were met. Vaccine efficacy (VE) (adjusted 95% confidence interval [CI]) for the co -primary endpoints against molecularly confirmed moderate to severe/critical COVID -19 in participants who were seronegative at Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 18/218 the time of vaccination was 66.9% (59.03; 73.40) when considering cases with onset at least 14 days after vaccination and 66.1% (55.01; 74.80) when considering cases with onset at least 28 days after vaccination , with c onsistent efficacy across age groups. In addition, the applicant stated that Ad26.COV2.S is highly effective in the prevention of severe/critical COVID -19, particularly in prevention of hospitalisation and death, across all countries and all ages. Vaccine efficacy (adjusted 95% CI) against molecularly confirmed severe/critical COVID - 19 with onset at least 14 days after vaccination was 76.7% (54.56; 89.09) and increased to 85.4% (54.15; 96.90) at least 28 days after vaccination. Vaccine efficacy against COVID -19 related hospital isation (including ICU admission, mechanical ventilation and ECMO) was 93.1% (95% CI: 72.74; 99.20) at was 100.0% (95% CI: 74.26; 100.0) at least 28 days after vaccination. Finally, according to the applicant, t here were no COVID -19-related deaths reported in the Ad26.COV2.S group compared to 5 COVID -19-related deaths reported in the placebo group. Ad26.COV2.S, given as a single do se, is found to have an acceptable safety and reactogenicity profile in adults 18 years of age and did not raise safety concerns in any of the assessed populations that are reflective of the target groups for vaccination, including adults 60 years of age and adults with comorbidities (including comorbidities associated with an increased risk of progressing to severe/critical COVID -19). It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data. The applicant intends to provide a comprehen sive post -marketing plan which is proposed to generate additional data on long -term follow -up and in populations not yet studied. Thes e data will be submitted as they become available. Unmet medical needs will be addressed. According to the applicant, desp ite 3 vaccines approved in the EU, the need for additional vaccines remains high in the EU and globally as the virus continues to spread, with highly transmissible variants continuing to emerge around the globe. The Janssen COVID -19 vaccine candidate, being single- dose, easily transportable and stored, and compatible with standard vaccine distribution channels could aid to the further enhancement of the response, to control this pandemic. In addition, Ad26.COV2.S is highly effective in the pr evention of severe/critical COVID -19 caused by newly emerging strains, such as the 20H/501Y.V2 strain first observed in South Africa and the P.2 variant first observed in Brazil. This finding is especially reassuring since it can be expected that more variants will occur over time. The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. According to the applicant, a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S is effective against all sympt omatic COVID - 19. Use of this vaccine could help to control the pandemic, to reduce the burden of disease and relieve pressure on the health care infrastructure, in view if its high efficacy in prevention of severe/critical COVID -19, especially hospital isation and death. In addition, the favourable storage conditions and single dose regimen will simplify deployment of vaccination. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 19/218 2.2. Quality aspects 2.2.1. Introduction The finished product (FP) is presented as a multidose suspension for injection containing not less than 8.92 log10 Inf.U (infectious units) per 0.5 mL dose, of Ad26.COV2- S (recombinant), the adenovirus type 26 vector encoding the SARS -CoV2 spike glycoprotein, as active substance (AS). (HBCD), citric chloride, sodium hydroxide, trisodium citrate dihydrate and water for injections. The product is available in a 2.5 mL multidose vial presentation (5 doses) in a 10 -vial pack. The type I glass vials have a chlorobutyl stopper with fluoropolymer coated surface, aluminium crimp and blue plastic cap. 2.2.2. Active substance General information The active substance, Ad26.COV2.S, is a recombinant, replication -incompetent adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26) encoding the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2) spike (S) protein. Wild type adenovirus type 26 consists of non -enveloped virions, between 80 and 100 nm in diameter , each containing a single linear molecule of dsDNA of approximately 35 kbp whi ch encode the adenoviral proteins. The dsDNA molecule is encapsulated by an icosahedral protein structure consisting of the structural proteins II (hexon), III (penton), IV (fibre), VI, VIII, IX, and IIIa. Core proteins V, VII, and X and the terminal protein are directly associated with the DNA molecule. The virus structure is shown in Figure 1. The recombinant Ad26 vector, Ad26.COV2.S, is replication inc ompetent after administration due to deletions in the E1 gene (E1A/E1B). The E1 deletion renders the vector replication -incompetent in noncomplementing cells such as human cells. In Ad5 complementing cell lines (e.g., HEK293, PER.C6 TetR and HER96 cell s lines) the virus can be propagated. In addition, a part of the E3 gene region has been removed (E3) to create sufficient space in the viral genome for insertion of foreign antigens and the Ad26 E4 orf6 has been exchanged by the Ad5 homologue to allow pr oduction of replication - incompetent Ad26 vectors in Ad5 E1 complementing cell lines. The Ad26.COV2.S vector contains a transgene in the E1A/E1B region which encodes a modified full - length SARS- CoV-2 spike protein with stabilizing modifications ( Figure 2). The wild -type full -length S gene information (NCBI reference: YP_009724390.1) was obtained from a SARS -CoV-2 clinical isolate. During production of the recombinant vector the expression of the S antigen is silenced by the producing cell line (PER.C6 TetR cells). After administration of the vaccine, the S antigen will be expressed in humans which will lead to an immune response.

All relevant active substance sites have valid m anufacturing authorisations or valid GMP certificates as appropriate. Description of manufacturing process and process controls The AS manufacturing process consists of ten stages: 1) pre -culture 2) cell expansion 3) virus production 4) lysis 5) DNA precipitation; 6) clarification 7) anion exchange chromatography (AEX) chromatography 8) polishing and buffer exchange 9) final adjust ment and fill and finally 10) freezing of the AS. Each preculture train (from large volume high density (LVHD) bag thaw through 10 L wave -mixed culture used for inoculation of stage 2) originates from a single LVHD bag and is used to produce one batch of AS. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 21/218 All steps of the AS manufacturing process are described in detail. The process starts with thawing of a vial of the cell substrate. Cells are expanded and then inoculated with the recombinant adenoviral construct. After virus production the cells are lysed and virus is collected. Purification steps include a DNA precipitation step, a clarification, an anion exchange chromatography step and diafiltration. The diafiltered product is then formulated and undergoes a 0.2 \u00b5m filtration before filling in polyc arbonate bottles. No reprocessing is claimed. The active substance is stored below - 40\u00b0C. As regards the control strategy, the manufacturing process is controlled using process parameters and in-process controls. Critical process parameters (CPPs) have be en provided for the AS manufacturing process which has been verified during AS process performance qualification (PPQ). The proposed operating ranges for the CPPs are acceptable. Both a small scale process at Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B .V. (Leiden, NL) , and a large scale process, at Janssen Biologics B .V. (Leiden, NL) and at Emergent Manufacturing Operations Baltimore LLC (USA), are included in the marketing authorisation application. The small scale process will be used for the initial commercial AS ba tches. Both small and large scale processes use tiered virus seed systems (including master virus seed (MVS), working virus seed (WVS) and inoculum). All virus seed material originates from the same MVS batch. Quality of process intermediates is adequately controlled by in -process controls. Any excursion outside of the defined ranges (action limits) will be investigated. A distinction is made between in -process controls (IPC) with strict acceptance criteria and IPC with predefined instructions. IPC results have to comply with acceptance criteria. The methods used for IPC and the method qualifications have been described. The manufacturing process is performed in a production facility at controlled room temperature. Maximum process durations and processing te mperatures are defined. The combination of hold time(s) and processing time(s) should not exceed the maximum process duration. Upon request, the applicant provided data for lifetime and sanitisation procedures for the anion exchange chromatography material. See Figure 3 for a flowchart of the AS manufacturing process. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 22/218 Figure 3: AS Manufacturing Process Overview Control of materials Raw materials Sufficient information on raw materials used in the active substance manufacturing process has been submitted. All materials have been described in detail. Compendial raw materials are tested in accordance with the corresponding monograph. For non -compendial raw materials, adequate specifications are in place to control their quality. Composition of media has been provided. No raw materials of human or animal origin are used in the AS manufacturing process. During establi shment of the virus seed, bovine serum has been used which was compliant to the effective version of EMA/410/01 (European Commission: Note for guidance on minimising the risk of transmitting animal spongiform encephalopathy agents via human and veterinary medicinal products), and thus does not pose any risk for transmission of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies/bovine spongiform encephalopathies (TSE/BSE). Benzonase, which is used during AS manufacturing, is produced in bacteria. The fermentation med ium contains casein hydrolysate that is produced from bovine milk sourced from healthy animals from Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 23/218 Australia and New Zealand. The material complies with the Note for Guidance EMEA/410/01 Rev. 3 (TSE). Casein hydrolysate is sterile filtered before its intr oduction into the fermentation medium. The latter itself is sterilised additionally in the fermenter at 121\u00b0C, 1 bar for 35 min. Accordingly, there are no risks with regards to extraneous agents (viral or microbial) contamination. Cell bank system The PER. C6 cell line is used for virus production. The PER.C6 cell line was derived from human embryonal retina (HER) cells, which were rendered immortal by transfection with the linearised pIG.E1A.E1B plasmid. The construction of the PIG.E1A.E1B plasmid was exten sively described. The preparation of both, adherent and suspension PER.C6 cell banks as well as the generation and selection of the PER.C6 TetR cell line and research cell bank (RCB) are well described. The PER.C6 TetR cell bank system has been documented in detail and is in line with ICH Q5D and ICH Q5A (R1). This cell bank was derived to optimise production of the recombinant virus. The repressor protein, which is expressed by the PER.C6 TetR cells, blocks expression of the SARS -Cov-2 transgene during pro duction of the recombinant adenoviral vector, thereby optimising vector production. The cell banking system is a tiered system, including MCB, WCB and LVHD. Information on storage and stability testing of cell banks is provided. Extensive testing at diffe rent levels (PER.C6 cell bank system and PER.C6 tetR cell bank system) has been performed which confirms that the PER.C6 TetR master cell bank (MCB) and working cell bank (WCB) have been properly qualified. Testing of cell banks for viral and non- viral adv entitious agents and screening also for retroviruses has been sufficiently described and is acceptable. Tumorigenicity and oncogenicity studies have been performed on the PER.C6 cell line. It is accepted that repetition of these studies with the PER.C6 Tet R cell line is considered not necessary in line with WHO TRS 978 Annex 3 and ICH Q5D. Additional characterisation testing also confirmed correct identity and genetic stability of the cell bank system. The applicant also described the manufacturing of future WCBs and LVHD cells. The proposed testing programme to qualify future WCBs and LVDH cells is deemed adequate. Virus seed system The construction of the plasmid pAd26.E1.CMVdel134- TO.COR200007 has been described. The pAd26.E1.CMVdel134- TO.COR200007 is a single genome plasmid which was used to produce the Ad26.COV2.S vector by transfection of this plasmid into PER.C6 TetR cells. To generate the replication incompetent ised pAd26.E1.CMVdel134- N644- 076. Two plaque purifications were performed to ensure the single plaque origin of the virus seed stocks. MVS 20E18- 04 was prepared by infecting PER.C6 TetR cells with pre -MVS E005872. The crude harvest (MVS 20E18- 04) has been stored in cryobags in a freezer below -65\u00b0C. WVS 20E20- 05 by infecting MVS 20E18- 04. A new WVS 964918 has been prepared for the large scale process. WVS 964918 ( large scale) was generated from MVS 20E18- 04 by first generating Ad26.COV2.S intermediate virus passage (IVP) 20F11- 04, which was subsequently used to generate WVS 964918. Both small and large scale processed uses tiered virus seed systems. All virus seed material orig inates from the same MVS batch. Generation of the recombinant virus and production and testing of the MVS and WVS has been described in detail (identity, safety including testing for sterility, mycoplasma, retroviruses for WVS, in vitro adventitious virus assay, replication competent adenovirus (RCA) and viral content). The proposed tests are deemed adequate. Specific tests for human viruses, porcine viruses and MMV were not performed since no materials from human or animal origin were used during generatio n of the virus seed system (except for irradiated foetal bovine serum). Since bovine serum was used during production of the pre- MVS, possible contamination by highly resistant bovine viruses cannot be fully excluded. Therefore, the applicant has performed additional screening for bovine viruses. The MVS and WVS were characterised for infectivity titre, genetic stability and stable expression of the Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 24/218 transgene. MVS, WVS and AS have identical sequences, demonstrating genetic stability. In addition, AS manufactured by the large scale process using inoculum (which includes additional virus passages) had identical sequences, confirming genetic stability. Correct expression of the transgene was confirmed. The applicant also described the manufacture of future WVS. The proposed testing programme to qualify future WVS is deemed adequate. The applicant confirms its commitment to implementing the 3Rs principle. The use of in vivo methods to qualify future batch es of WCB, LVHD and WVS is not necessary since the manufacture of such materials does not represent any contamination risks that are not already mitigated. The in vivo testing has been removed as a release requirement for future batches of WVS, WCB and LVH D (including testing via end of production cells). A summary of the validation of the transport of the cell banks and virus seeds to the manufacturing sites has been provided. Transport is properly validated. Control of critical steps and intermediates The applicant provided an overview of critical process parameters (CPPs) and in -process controls (IPC). Overall, the control strategy is deemed acceptable. Each IPC is associated with a test method, a sampling location and an acceptance criterion or a predef ined instruction . IPC results comply with acceptance criteria. See manufacturing process development section for further details of control strategy development. Process validation Process validation has a lifecycle, starting with process development followed by commercial scale process verification/process performance qualification (PV/PPQ) runs and then continues in the form of ongoing process verification throughout routine production. Process validation at commercial scale is carried out to demonstrate that the process is capable of reproducibly manufacturing product meeting quality requirements. Based on experience with the Ad26 vaccine platform products, critical quality attributes (CQA), critical material attributes (CMA) and CPP have been assigned. The process validation addresses the following: validation of different process steps (Stages 1 -10); qualification of process intermediate hold times; control of impurities; consistency of DS; shipping qualification; continued process verification. Further more, IPC and release tests were established as part of an initial control strategy. The purpose of process validation is to demonstrate that the manufacturing process meets the acceptance criteria for IPC, release testing, CPP and CMA. Supporting data to confirm these CPPs and CMAs and to define proven acceptable ranges (PAR) are generated during process validation concurrent to Ad26.COV2.S commercial manufacturing. PPQ data have been provided for the small scale AS process at Janssen Vaccines & Preventio n B.V. (Leiden, NL), the large scale AS process at Janssen Biologics B.V. (Leiden, NL) and Emergent Baltimore (USA), including data from AS process verification / process performance qualification (PV/PPQ) (process parameter results, IPC results, impurity removal, batch data and hold times) confirming the validated status of the process at these sites. In addition, process validation for the inoculum performed at Janssen Biologics B.V. (Leiden, NL) was completed through the successful execution of two consecutive PV/PPQ batches. Results from the third PPQ lot should be provided post -approval (recommendation 1 ). Two active and passive shipping systems are proposed and have been suitably validated for the transport of AS. Qualification data were prov ided to support the hold times used during AS manufacture. A shipping system has been qualified for the transport of inoculum. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 25/218 Manufacturing process development A process control strategy was developed based on extensive AdVac/PER.C6 platform experience an d following scientific rationale. Potential CQA, preliminary CPP, and preliminary CMA were established and controlled by different tests: IPC, release, characterisation and stability. The risk for viral contamination, RCA and adventitious agents has been m itigated by performing appropriate testing to starting and raw materials in compliance with applicable regulatory guidance documents, together with appropriate IPC and release tests. The process used to identify critical quality attributes associated with the AS and FP is sufficiently described and explained. A criticality assessment was performed based on the level of severity and the degree of knowledge uncertainty. The CQA identified by the criticality assessment are properly described. A summary of the preliminary CPP and CMA is provided, together with justifications for their criticality. The history of the process development is summarised. Four process manufacturing variants (S -VAL-1 to S-VAL-4) of the AS manufacturing process have been used for the small scale process and three additional variants (S -VLF-1, S-VLF-2 and S -EME-1) for the large process . The batches that have been produced for clinical development as well as the current inventory of material produced for commercial use were manufactured a t the small bioreactor scale (Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V., Leiden, NL). To ensure sufficient supply for commercial use, the applicant has upscaled the process to a bioreactor of large scale at the Janssen Biologics B.V. (Leiden, NL) site and the Emergent Baltimore (US A). Detailed information has been provided on the equipment used and on the process parameter results and IPC results for the 3 clinical lots and the first commercial AS lots of each of the three commercial sites. Results were highly similar for all process parameters and IPCs for all AS batches produced thus far. The essential elements of the AS manufacturing process were retained throughout process development. The AS manufacturing process variant S -VAL-2/3 did not change with respect to the manufacturing process variant S -VAL-1, apart from two differences. The introduction of an additional virus seed passage (AS was manufactured from WVS i.e. additional virus seed passage) was qualified by a comparability analysis confirming the absence of any impact on AS quality. Variant S -VAL-1/2/3 were used for Phase 1/2/3 clinical trials; however, these 3 variants can essentially be considered the same process. The introduction of a larger AS storage container is also assessed. Some further process optimisations were introduced for the S -VAL-4 process used for the small commercial batches. A 2 -Tier staggered approach has been used to demonstrate comparability between S -VAL-2/3 and S -VAL-4 AS batches. The Tier 1 contains the release testing results a nd some important characterisation tests. The Tier 2 part of the comparability assessment comprises additional character isation . Both the results for release tests and characterisation tests were highly similar. Therefore, it can be concluded that the AS lots from the commercial small scale process at Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V. (Leiden, NL) are comparable to the lots used in the Phase 3 clinical trials. Furthermore, as part of the qualification of the large scale process at the Janssen Biologics B. V. (Leiden, NL), a third study was performed to demonstrate comparability between AS from the large scale process and the small scale process (Process Variants S -VAL-4, small scale, and S -VLF-1/2, large scale) and was also designed as a 2 -Tier staggered approach. Comparability was demonstrated based on the tier 1 comparability data. Similarly, comparability was also demonstrated between AS from the Emergent (USA) site and AS from the other commercial sites based on tier 1 data. The applicant should provide, upon availability, the tier 2 comparability data to confirm that the large scale AS (from Janssen Biologics B.V. ( Leiden, NL ) and from Emergent Baltimore (USA)) is comparable to the small scale process material (from Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V. , Leiden, NL) ( recommendations 2 and 3). Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 26/218 Characterisation Characterisation studies were conducted using AS batches and FP batches, including clinical trial material and commercial use lots, investigating c apsid composition, particle heterogeneity, virus DNA, biological activity and structure -function relationships. The AS has been adequately character ised using a range of biochemical, biophysical and biological state - of-the-art methods revealing that the a ctive substance has the expected structure. In conclusion, the correct expression of adenovirus proteins was confirmed and shown to be consistent. In addition, typical adenovirus particle results were obtained upon biophysical character isation . Biological activity: Relative level of potency assay (QPA) in release testing showed a strong correlation to the TGE -ELISA character isation results, supporting that the transgene expression level is sufficiently controlled by infectivity (QPA ) in release testing. Character isation of virus DNA confirmed the transgene identity and flanking regions. The genomic integrity and stability of Ad26.COV2.S AS was shown upon additional passaging. Furthermore, transgene genetic stability analysis confirme d expression of the transgene and phenotypic stability. Finally, structure/function relationships were characterised using forced degradation studies which indicated that the major route of degradation of Ad26.COV2.S exposed to thermal stress was virus protein degradation. This degradation led to a linear decrease in potency (on log 10 scale) as determ ined by infectivity and relative transgene expression measurements, indicative of a first order degradation. Additional characterisation was carried out with the inoculum to determine genetic stability . Impurities Process- related impurities have been char acterised during clinical development of the current product and also during previous studies performed for other Ad26 viral vectors produced using the same platform technology. Process -related impurities from the AS manufacturing process include cell cult ure media components and additives, PER.C6 TetR host cell constituents and downstream buffer components. The principles of quality risk management (ICH Q9) were used to identify critical process - related impurities. From the assessment of 81 impurities, it was concluded that most were non -critical. Only 2 process - related impurities were considered critical, host cell DNA and host cell protein (HCP); these are controlled via the AS specifications. Upon request, the applicant has provided summaries of the impu rity spiking studies. The data demonstrate that the chromatography purification and the various filtration steps result in efficient removal of impurities . All these impurities are reduced by several log units during purification of AS. The level of impuri ty removal is deemed sufficient. The applicant has also provided calculations of worst- case situation levels of the different impurities taking into account the reduction obtained by the purification steps. It was shown that all impurities are reduced to s ufficiently low levels which do not raise any concerns regarding safety. Potential product- related impurities include empty or incomplete adenovirus particles, adenovirus aggregates and (fragments of) adenovirus proteins, and post -translationally modified forms of the adenovirus protein. Product- related impurities, were analysed and shown to be low in quantity and consistent between AS batches (regardless of the DS manufacturing scale, small or large). Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 27/218 The stated impurities have been present in product us ed in clinical trials. Specification The release and stability specifications for Ad26.COV2.S AS comprise appropriate physico -chemical tests and tests for identity, purity and potency. The specification of Ad26.COV2.S AS consists of the following tests: identity by ID -PCR and virus protein fingerprinting by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP -HPLC); impurities (HCP by ELISA and host cell DNA by qPCR); potency (transgene expression by qualitative EL ISA, infectious units, ratio virus particles/infectious units); quantity (virus particles by VP -qPCR), safety (bioburden, bacterial endotoxins, replication competent adenovirus) and general tests (appearance, pH and polysorbate 80 concentration). The spec ifications proposed for the AS are deemed acceptable. Upon request during the procedure the applicant has included a release test for replication competent adenovirus (RCA) which is considered an important safety test for a pandemic vaccine virus and requi red by the Ph. Eur. 5.14. Upon request the HCP acceptance criterion has been further tightened to an acceptable level. In addition, the infectivity specification has been increased to maintain alignment with the revised FP specification. Analytical metho ds The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non -compendial methods) appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. Compendial methods were verified to demonstrate that the methods are suitable for use with the current pro duct and that no interference/inhibition occurs. The specification includes tests for both viral particle (VP) concentration and infectious units (Inf.U) to measure potency. Transgene expression is measured by an enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay . The qualitative procedure to measure transgene expression confirms that cells infected with Ad26.COV2.S express the transgene protein. Upon request, the applicant provided more information on the source of the recombinant fusion protein , that is used as a primar y antibody in the transgene expression assay; specificity of this primary antibody has been demonstrated. Batch analysis Satisfactory batch analysis data and additional characterisation test results are provided for clinical AS batches and small scale com mercial batches (including PPQ lots), all produced at the Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V. small -scale commercial AS manufacturing site (Leiden, NL), for large scale PPQ batches produced at the Janssen Biologics B.V. large scale manufacturing site (Leid en, NL) and for large scale PPQ batches produced at the Emergent Baltimore (US A) site. Reference materials The same reference standard is used for AS and FP testing. See FP Reference materials section for more detailed information. Container closure system The applicant provided a detailed description of the AS container. An extractables study was performed for the AS container. The data from the extractables study results did not indicate any reason of concern. The container is stated to comp ly with the European requirements on leachables and extractables outlined in CPMP/QWP/4359/03. The container closure system for the AS is qualified for product shipping, Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 28/218 freezing/thawing and long -term storage. The integrity of the container closure system is validated. A risk assessment was performed which confirmed that additional leachables studies are not required for the AS container. Stability A shelf life of AS when the AS is stored frozen was proposed by the applicant. The proposed shelf life is supported by long term (below - 40\u00b0C) and accelerated (2 -8\u00b0C) stability data from other Ad26 viral vectors produced using the same platform technology (> 40 AS lots ranging from 24 months to 48 months stability). These lots were a lso stored in the same polycarbonate containers as proposed for this product and they were manufactured at the small scale at Janssen Vaccine and Prevention B.V. ( Leiden , NL). Given the COVID -19 pandemic and the current circumstances and urgency, this appr oach is deemed acceptable. The AS is typically very stable when stored below -40\u00b0C; no trends are observed during shelf life. The applicant has placed representative AS lots on stability (real time at - 60\u00b0C and accelerated at 5\u00b0C) in accordance with applicable ICH guidelines. These include clinical and manufacturing lot s manufactured at the small scale at the Janssen Vaccine and Prevention B.V. site (Leiden, NL) and large scale lots from the Janssen Biologics B.V. site (Leiden, NL). Since the glass transiti on temperature of the AS is - 34\u00b0C, stability studies at the proposed temperature are appropriate to support the storage conditions. AS lots were stored in bottles considered representative of the commercial containers. The proposed stability testing progra mme is deemed acceptable and includes appropriate stability -indicating parameters. All batches are tested for pH, infectious units, transgene expression, virus particle (vector concentration), and ratio VP/ Inf.U at all timepoints. Currently 6 months stab ility data are available for AS lots and 3 months for the small scale commercial lot (manufactured at the Janssen Vaccine and Prevention B.V. site) and for one large scale commercial lot (manufactured at the Janssen Biologics B.V. site). The AS stability s tudies will be continued until completion at the real -time stability storage condition and at the accelerated stability storage condition. The applicant should provide the AS stability data for representative AS batches (from the small scale production sit e) when the stability study has been finalised and the results are available (recommendation 4 ). Any confirmed out- of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should however be reported to the EMA. In addition to the three representative small scale AS lots, stability studies have been initiated with large scale commercial AS batches . Results will be provided when the data are available. Finally, the applicant should also initiate stability studies for 3 PPQ AS lots from each of the AS manufactu ring sites and from future added sites ( recommendation 4 ). An appropriate shelf -life of the AS and storage conditions were agreed. Stability -monitoring programs for two i noculum batches have also been initiated. A re -test date for inoculum when stored frozen was proposed by the applicant. This date will be extended when the stability studies confirm stability. 2.2.3. Finished medicinal product Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development FP composition The Ad26.COV2.S FP is supplied as a st erile liquid suspension for injection. The FP is intended for administration by the intramuscular route. Each dose contains not less than 8.92 Log 10 Infectious Units (Inf.U) and not less than 2.5 x 1010 VP. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 29/218 The container closure system used for the finish ed product is a 2R Type I glass vial with a chlorobutyl closure and an aluminium seal with a flip -off cap. Each vial contains an excess fill volume to allow for an extractable volume of 2.5 mL as 5 extractions of 0.5 mL. The FP contains no preservative. The composition of the FP is shown in Table 1. The AS is already formulated in formulation buffer sterile filtered and filled in 2R Type I glass vials with an excess fill volume for commercial supply batches. No additional excipients are added during the FP manufacture. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel excipien ts used in the finished product formulation. Table 1: Composition of Ad26.COV2.S FP. Component Gradea Function Ad26.COV2.S Company Standard Eur., 0677 pH adjuster Hydrochloric acid Ph. Eur., 0002 pH adjuster Water for injections Ph. Eur., 0169 Diluent Formulation development The development of the FP has been described in detail. The formulation composition (excipients, concentrations, pH) of Ad26.COV2.S FP was based on prior knowledge from formulation studies with similar adenoviral vector -based products. The type of excipients and the quantitative composition of Ad26.COV2.S FP were selected based on early formulation development studies. The selection of the formulation composition was based on the results of formulation screening and optimisation studies performed for Ad26.COV2.S and representative Ad26 platform products and parameters evaluated comprised pH, buffer type, various stabilisers (cryoprotectant, antioxidant and surfactant) and tonicifying agents. Suitability of the final selected formulation for Ad26.COV2.S FP was demonstrated in product -specific studies demonstrating acceptable stability during refrigerated and accelerated storage. The late stage Ad26.COV2.S FP development consisted of studies designed to evaluate the stability of the formula tion during temperature cycling, freeze- thaw stress, mechanical stress (agitation) and thermal stability at elevated temperatures. The conclusions are based on studies on Ad26.COV2.S and representative Ad26 platform products. Overall, the Ad26.COV2.S data obtained in assessments covering the range of conditions described are in agreement with representative Ad26 platform products data and support leveraging of platform data. Pharmaceutical development The Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) is presented w ith links to defined CQAs. For the CQA identification process, potentially relevant quality attributes were selected based on the QTPP, pre - assessment and prior knowledge of other adeno vectors. Control of FP CQA is based on an integrated strategy includin g material controls, process parameter limits, IPCs, release and stability testing and GMP/ quality systems. A summary is provided of the criticality identification process and assessments for CPPs. Data supporting proven acceptable ranges (PAR) for CPP an d non -CPP (nCPP) are provided. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 30/218 However, some parameters are still being evaluated and are classified as potentially critical. A final conclusion on the criticality of the potentially critical parameters should be provided upon availability (recommendation 10). The justifications of IPC acceptance criteria, including summaries of IPC results during the development and clinical manufacturing batches are provided. Information was provided on the different process variants used during product development and o n the FP batches produced thus far. The differences between the clinical and commercial manufacturing processes are described and includes changes of site, change from single to multi -dose and scale. Information is provided to support equivalence of the clinical trial and commercial formulation buffer composition and manufacture. Additionally, to evaluate the sensitivity of Ad26.COV2.S FP when exposed to light stress, a study based on the ICH Q1B requirement will be performed. The samples should be tested for potency, turbidity, radius and aggregation ( recommendation 8 ). The AS thawing stage includes storage of AS at the FP manufacturing facility, thawing of frozen AS and an optional refrigerated intermediate hold step. Comparability A comparability anal ysis was performed demonstrating that early clinical material (phase 1/2) was comparable to the FP lots used in the phase 3 trials (study 1). Based on an assessment of the release, IPC and character isation results of the clinical batches the study 1 conclu sions are that the Ad26.COV2.S FP batches produced using the post change manufacturing process variants are comparable to the FP batches produced using the pre change manufacturing process variant. This comparability assessment therefore confirms that the post -change manufacturing process variants introduced do not adversely impact the quality, safety and potency of the Ad26.COV2.S FP batches. A forced degradation study (thermal stress) is ongoing in support of this comparability assessment ( recommendation 9). Since some changes have also been introduced in the FP process for commercial production, a comparability analysis has been initiated to compare phase 3 FP lots and future commercial FP lots (study 2). A 2 -tiered approach has been proposed by the appli cant to demonstrate comparability. According to this approach, initial comparability assessment (tier 1) consists of comparison of release and IPC results. If the release results of both pre- and post -change FP batches are within the commercial specificati ons, it will be concluded that the initial comparability criteria are met and post- use FP lots will be released for commercial use. This enables timely use of post- change materials to alleviate the high demand due to the COVID -19 pandemic. The tier 1 resul ts have already been provided for the FP PPQ lots from the first FP commercial site and demonstrate that the commercial FP is comparable to the clinical material. Additional characterisation test results (tier 2) should be provided post- approval (recommend ation 6). In addition, comparability data (tier 1 and tier 2) is requested for the second finished product site to confirm the FP is comparable to the FP from the first commercial site and the clinical material (Specific obligation 1 ). Given the COVID -19 pandemic and the current circumstances and urgency, this approach is deemed acceptable. Container closure integrity tests (CCIT), residual seal force (RSF) tests and headspace analysis are used to validate the integrity of the container closure system and its ability to prevent the ingress of microbial contamination to the final product. In addition, A d26.COV2.S FP samples have been tested for RSF at t = 0 and after 3 weeks of storage at - 85 \u00baC confirming integrity of the FP container. Compatibility studies were performed mimicking vaccine administration conditions in the field to ensure that the steps required prior to administration do not impact the quality of the product. Results of studies investigating the compatibility of the Ad26.COV2.S FP with syringes and needles used for intramuscular administration Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 31/218 are presented. Physicochemical and biologica l stability as well as microbiological safety were assessed. Additionally, microbial growth for the in -use conditions was evaluated in a microbial challenge study. Container closure system Detailed information was provided on the multi -dose FP container closure system, which contains 5 doses of the FP. The container closure system used for the FP is a 2R Type I glass vial closed with a latex-free rubber stopper (chlorobutyl with fluoropolymer coated surface), aluminium crimp and blue plastic cap . All relevant components (glass vials and rubber stoppers) comply with applicable Ph. Eur. guidance. Container closure integrity of the FP container was demonstrated. Extractables and leachables studies were performed (or are ongoing). The extractables st udy did not reveal any compounds of concern as regards safety. The applicant has provided data from an extractables study performed for Zabdeno (same container, vial and stopper). These data did not indicate any compounds of concern. Results from the leach ables studies should be provided post -approval (recommendation 11 ). Manufacture of the product and process controls The FP is manufactured at different manufacturing sites . Batch certification is performed at Janssen Pharmaceutica N. V. (Beerse, BE) or Janssen Biologics B .V. (Leiden, NL). All sites have appropriate GMP certification. A detailed listing of test sites and associated testing is stated in the dossier. A major objection regarding GMP status was raised for three FP sites however, valid proof of G MP compliance has now been provided for these sites. The major objection is resolved. The applicant has proposed an additional FP release testing site for sterility and endotoxin. However, qualification of this site is currently ongoing and is expected to be finalised in May 2021. Therefore, the applicant has requested a time -limited exemption allowing reliance on FP release testing for sterility and endotoxin conducted in registered sites that are located in a third country. This approach is acceptable. The length for the QC testing site exemption has been clearly defined (until 30 June 2021) and it concerns compendial tests (endotoxin and sterility). Suitability testing will be performed according to pharmacopoeial requirements for method transfer qualific ation (see Product Information Annex II.A). Description of manufacturing process and pro cess controls The FP manufacturing process consists of several steps. First, the AS is thawed, pre -filtered, pooled and diluted with pre- filtered formulation buffer. The formulated bulk is homogen ised, sterile filtered in -line (two 0.2\u00b5m filters connected in series) and aseptically filled into vials, stoppered and capped. Filling is done immediately after sterile filtration. The sterile filtered bulk is not stored. Subsequently, the vials are visually inspected, frozen , labelled and packed. All steps of the FP manufacturing process at the proposed FP manufacturing sites have been described and information on CPPs and IPCs was provided. The proposed C PPs and IPCs are deemed adequate and sufficient to control the FP process. Prior to the start of sterile in -line filtration, both sterilising filters are tested to ensure filter integrity, and a bioburden sample is taken from the holding vessel. The mini mum and maximum FP batch size has been defined for the proposed FP manufacturing sites. Hold times are defined. The formulation buffer used in the commercial FP manufacture is made at the commercial manufacturing site as part of the FP manufacturing process. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 32/218 Process validation and/or evaluation The validation of the manufacturing process for the Ad26.COV2.S FP consists of several steps: (1) validation of process steps, (2) validation of hold times during manufacturing process and (3) validation of media fills. Process verification and process performance qualification (PV/PPQ) studies have been performed for the FP sites. The process validation for manufacture of Ad26.COV2.S FP consisted of three successful validation runs performed at the minimum, intermediate and maximum FP batch sizes. For each of the process validation runs, the IPC and FP product release met their predefined acceptance criteria and FP release specifications, respectively. The results presented in this section demonstrate that th e Ad26.COV2.S FP manufacturing process as executed at the commercial manufacturing site is under control and produces final FP of consistent quality that meets specifications. Continued process verification (CPV), will be performed to assure that the FP pr ocess remains in a state of control during commercial manufacture. The FP manufacturing process at the site is adequately validated. Some additional characterisation data to confirm homogeneity and the hold times should be provided when available (recommendation 7 ). With regards to the second FP manufacturing site, batch data of the 3 PPQ lots were provided. All results were compliant with the FP specifications and also highly similar to release test results from phase 3 clinical lots and batches from the first site. However, the complete data have not been provided. Therefore, the applicant is requested to provide the full FP PPQ data from the 3 representative FP lots from the second site (including hold times). In addition, comparability data (tier 1 and tier 2) are requested to confirm that the FP from this site is comparable to the FP from the first commercial site and consequentially also confirm comparability with clinical material ( specific obligation 1 ). This approach is acceptable in the context of the COVID -19 pandemic public health emergency. The applicant has submitted an updated section 3.2.S.2.5 on shipping validation including information on air transport. All shipping routes are described including air transport. For each route the used shipping systems are indicated. All shipping systems, including the ones used for air transport, have been properly qualified via thermal qualification, distribution testing and shipping route verification. A media fill simulation has been executed which confirmed that the aseptic handling procedures and th e environmental conditions for the filling step are considered appropriate for the production of FP. The operating parameters used for the media fill are set to challenge worst- case conditions that may occur during routine manufacturing and operational con ditions. The vials are filled at high speeds (higher risk for interventions) and low speeds (prolonged exposure) to simulate worst- case production conditions. Filling is done immediately after sterile filtration. The sterile filtered bulk is not stored. Ma ximum times are indicated for each FP process step (all CPPs). Therefore, the maximum time for the complete FP process is defined as well as the maximum time of FP vials exposed to 2 -8\u00b0C and to 25\u00b0C. Vials are depyrogenated and caps are steam sterilised. T he depyrogenation and autoclave have been adequately validated. The rubber stoppers are provided by the supplier as ready -to-use sterile rubber stoppers. The applicant has provided the requested information on the sterilisation of the stoppers. The stopper s are deemed acceptable for use in the FP container. Appropriate filter validation reports are provided and it is concluded that the filters are deemed suitable for the intended use. For the second FP site, sections 3.2.P.3.5 Process Validation and/or Evaluation - Depyrogenation of Glass Vials, 3.2.P.3.5 Process Validation and/or Evaluation - Sterilisation of Equipment Components and Stoppers, and 3.2.P.3.5 Process Validation and/or Evaluation - Decontamination of Filling isolators should be provided post -authorisation ( recommendation 5 ). Filled FP at first site is then shipped (between - 30\u00b0C and - 15\u00b0C) to a packaging site , where labelling and secondary packaging proceeds. This site then ships the packaged product (between -30\u00b0C and -15\u00b0C) Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 33/218 to the Janssen Di stribution Centres where it is stored between - 30\u00b0C and - 15\u00b0C. The shipping of the FP has been evaluated through a shipping route verification study and a distribution testing study which evaluated the impact of shipping on product packaging, including con tainer closure integrity of the vials. Product specification Release and stability specifications as well as description of the analytical procedures were provided. The parameters tested are appearance (degree of coloration, clarity, and visible particles ), identity by (ID) - PCR and virus protein fingerprinting by RP -HPLC, potency with transgene expression by quantitative ELISA and infectious units by QPA, quantity (virus particles) by VP -qCR, purity ( aggregates average hydrodynamic radius and polydispersit y) by DLS, safety tests (sterility, bacterial endotoxins, container closure integrity) and general tests (pH, osmolality, extractable volume, and polysorbate 80 concentration). The FP specification acceptance criteria have been sufficiently justified and t he specification ranges are deemed acceptable. The FP specification for infectious units is considered the most important parameter for FP. The initially proposed lower limits for FP infectious units at release and end -of-shelf-life (EOSL) were lower than the potency of the phase 3 clinical lots and could not be considered as clinically qualified/justified (this was a major objection). Subsequently, the applicant increased the infectious units release lower limit and the end of shelf life limit. Since for immunogenicity and clinical efficacy the potency as expressed in infectious units is relevant, the potency of the vaccine should be expressed on the labelling in line with other viral vaccines. Therefore, it was proposed to change the labelling t o \"not less than 8.92 log 10 Inf.U/dose\", instead of \"not less than 2.5\u00d71010 VP/dose\". The applicant agreed to express the labelling in Inf.U. Identity, bacterial endotoxins, osmolality, extractable volume and polysorbate 80 concentration are not tested du ring stability studies. A test for replication -competent adenovirus (RCA) is performed on the AS only. The ratio infectious units/viral particles is established at AS level and a similar specification has also been established for FP release. Since curren tly only limited experience is available for the polydispersity specification, the applicant's proposal to report the result without an acceptance criterion is acceptable. For the time being it is agreed that FP aggregates are sufficiently controlled by th e hydrodynamic radius specification. However, it is expected that an acceptance criterion for polydispersity will be established and justified once sufficient experience and data for this parameter are available ( recommendation 12 ). For the transgene expression a qualitative ELISA is performed to confirm expression. The applicant has properly justified the use of the assay for determining the transgene expression. The validation of this method has been briefly described. In addition , the applicant has pointed out how the relative transgene expression levels correlate linearly with infectivity results obtained by QPA, the latter being a quantitative way to measure infectivity of Ad26.COV2.S. For the extractable volume, the applicant states that the acce p tance limit of 2.5 mL ensures tha t enough volume can be extracted from the vial for correct dosing of up to five doses of 0.5 mL each (tested as 5 times an extraction of 0.5 mL). Due to the implementation of ICH Q3D guideline on elemental impurities, compliance to ICH Q3D should be confirmed. Although vaccines are strictly taken, not within the scope of ICH Q3D, a risk assessment of the elemental impurity level in the finished product should be performed in order to keep the same level of safety assurance on elemental impurities, as requested according to Ph. Eur. general chapter 5.20. A summary of this risk assessment and a control strategy for elemental impurities in accordance with ICH Q3D should be provided ( recommendation 13 ). Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 34/218 A risk evaluation conce rning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been performed (as requested) considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the \"Questions and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opini on for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products\" (EMA/409815/2020) and the \"Assessment report - Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in huma n medicinal products\" (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the information provided it is accepted that no risk was identified on the possible presence of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no additional contr ol measures are deemed necessary. No new impurities are introduced during the FP manufacture. The major objection is considered resolved. Analytical methods Descriptions were provided for all the analytical methods used for FP release testing. The analytic al methods for virus identity, protein fingerprinting, transgene expression, infectious units, virus particles and PS80 content are the same methods as used for the AS. Compendial methods are used for pH, osmolality, extractable volume, sterility, endotoxi n, container closure integrity and appearance. The only FP-specific method is the assay for aggregates. All non -compendial methods were appropriately validated at each test site. Compendial methods were verified to demonstrate that the methods are suitable for use with the current product and that no interference/inhibition occurs. Method suitability and absence of interference by the product were demonstrated for the endotoxin and sterility tests. Batch analysis Batch analysis results are presented for cli nical single dose finished product (FP) FP batch, multidose commercial PPQ FP batches first commercial site and multidose commercial PPQ FP batches from the second site . Information regarding batch scale, manufactu ring dates and genealogy is provided Also, additional characterisation test results are provided. The single-dose and multi -dose processes are highly similar. The main difference between the phase 3 process and commercial process is the scale of filling an d the fill volume (single dose versus five -dose). The results are within the specifications and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process. Reference materials The applicant provided a detailed description of the reference materials used during devel opment. Reference material (RM) is used as a control in release, stability and in -process testing, and for character isation methods throughout the product development lifecycle. The same reference material is used for AS and FP testing. RM includes researc h material (ResMat) and development reference material (DRM). In the future, a primary reference material (PRM) and working reference material (WRM) will be derived from representative batches and qualified. The PRM and first WRM will be taken from different FP batches manufactured using the clinical Phase 3 DP manufacturing process. The FP used to prepare the PRM was made from AS from the small scale process (manufacturing process variant S -VAL-4) at 1 x 10 11 VP/mL, and the FP used to prepare the WRM will be made from AS from the large scale process (manufacturing process variant S -VLF-2) at 2 x 1011 VP/mL. A qualification protocol for the primary reference material and working reference material has been provided and is deemed acceptable. For the time bein g, the DRM2 and DRM3 (both used during phase 3 studies) are considered sufficiently qualified and therefore suitable for use as reference material for commercial AS and FP. The ResMat was used for testing clinical batches (Phase 1, 2, and 3) and as the RM to qualify RM Batch (DRM1). This lot is used in part of the Phase 3 trials until implementation of RM Batches (DRM2) and Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 35/218 (DRM3). The latter two are used for Phase 3 trials and first commercial lots (until a primary and working standard will be established in the future). The applicant has provided a testing protocol for future primary reference standard and working reference standards, which is deemed sufficient and acceptable. Stability of the product The proposed shelf life of the Ad26.COV2.S FP is 2 years when FP is stored frozen at -25\u00b0C to -15\u00b0C, with a single storage period of 3 months at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (not exceeding the expiry date) . Within these 24 months, a 3 months storage at 2 -8\u00b0C is also proposed. The FP should not be refrozen after it has been p laced in storage at 2 -8\u00b0C. The FP must be stored in the original packaging in order to protect it from light. Only a few early time points of Ad26.COV2.S stability studies on clinical batches (Phase 1 -3) are currently available. The shelf life is based on platform data from similar Ad26 products. These platform products were stored in the same vials as Ad26.COV2.S The same stability -indicating assays were used in the studies as are being used for Ad26.COV2.S commercial product studies. Up to 36 month -data are provided from more than 50 FP lots at different temperatures ( -80\u00b0, -20\u00b0C). This includes data from 4 lots stored at - 20\u00b0C for 36 months. These are considered sufficiently representative since the particles are identical (apart from the genome which co ntains a different insert). Based on these data and input from other development studies, a conservative shelf life model was constructed to justify the proposed initial shelf life for Ad26.COV2.S FP. In this model, the following factors were taken into account: AS stability, shelf life specifications, expected losses during packaging and labelling, temperature excursions, in -use and an estimate of the average degradation slope. Storage at - 20\u00b0C or lower does not have any impact on FP quality; no tre nds are observed for potency. When stored at 2- 8\u00b0C, a slight decrease in potency occurs over time. Using platform data and a model for potency decrease, the applicant has proposed that 'once removed from the freezer, the unopened vaccine may be stored refr igerated at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C, protected from light, for a single period of up to 3 months, not exceeding the printed expiry date. Once thawed, the vaccine should not be re- frozen' . This period is considered conservative when taking into account the statistical m odel and the stability data from other Ad26 products. The applicant also indicates that the FP must be stored in the original packaging in order to protect it from light. As requested, the applicant provided information on the stability study and the risk assessment (in absence of photostability data). This is considered acceptable at this point. However, to evaluate the sensitivity of Ad26.COV2.S Finished Product when exposed to light stress, a study based on the ICH Q1B requirement should be performed. T he samples should be tested for potency, turbidity, radius and aggregation ( recommendation 8 ). The clinical single dose FP batches and the commercial multidose FP batch included in the stability studies will be stored in accordance with applicable ICH guidelines. In accordance with EU GMP guidelines 1, any confirmed out- of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to EMA. As regards the in -use shelf life of the FP, it was shown during product development that: 1 6.32 of Vol. 4 Part I of the Rules Governing Medicinal products in the European Union Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 36/218 'Chemical and physical in -use stability of the vaccine has been demonstrated for 6 hours at 2\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C. From a microbiological point of view, the product should preferably be used immediately after first puncture of the vial; however, the product can be stored between 2\u00b0C -8\u00b0C for a maximum of 6 hours or remain at room temperature (maximally 25\u00b0C) up to 3 hours after first puncture of the vial. Beyond these times, in -use storage is the responsibility of the user.' The applicant is requested to provide t he stability data from PPQ FP lots from the facility when available. In addition, for each additional FP manufacturing site, FP stability studies should be initiated and these data can be provided post -approval (recommendation 14 ). In addition, the applic ant has investigated the possible impact of mechanical stress (experienced during transport) on the thawed finished product (potency and quality). No impact was observed. Moreover, it was also shown that the vaccine is relatively stable when exposed to roo m temperature for a limited period of time. Therefore, the applicant has included guidance in the SmPC with regard to possible temperature excursions above 8\u00b0C and transport of the thawed vaccine. In conclusion, the FP shelf -life is adequately supported by the submitted data. A 2- year shelf life for the vaccine when stored between - 25\u00b0C and - 15\u00b0C (long- term storage) and the additional storage conditions described in section 6.4 (Special precautions for storage) of the SmPC are accepted. Post approval chang e management protocol(s) The applicant has provided a protocol for addition and validation of new sites for AS and FP production at a larger scale. Initially, batches for clinical development and small -scale commercial supply are manufactured at a bioreac tor scale of small scale . A process scale -up was established to manufacture AS at large scale. New sites are foreseen to manufacture at the large scale. Compared to the process used for clinical and small -scale commercial manufacturing, the scale -up is mos tly linear and the unit operations remain the same. Where applicable, prior knowledge from other AdVac/PER.C6 platform - based products has been and will be considered for the process design. Process validation protocols are provided. In order to evaluate th at each newly introduced AS manufacturing site is capable of consistently performing manufacturing process, a process validation/process performance qualification (PV/PPQ) campaign based on preliminary CPP and preliminary critical material attributes (CMA) will be completed. A minimum of 3 AS or FP lots will be produced for PPQ; acceptance criteria for CPPs and critical material attributes must be met (with potential necessary adjustments due to site or scale elements); results for IPC and release tests must comply with the acceptance criteria and the specifications. The AS process at large bioreactor scale will be transferred to additional manufacturing sites. Implementation of new manufacturing sites may result in limited changes to process parameter set- points/ranges, equipment and raw materials. The applicant has previously successfully applied similar process changes, e.g., AS manufacturing site transfers, to manufacture other AdVac/PER.C6 platform - based vaccine candidates that have met their specificati ons. Initial release and character isation testing of the large scale AS batches of other AdVac/PER.C6 platform -based vaccine products demonstrated comparable quality of the vaccine. Initially, FP batches were manufactured for commercial supply. The commerc ial FP manufacturing process has been scaled up and will be transferred to additional sites to increase manufacturing capacity. To demonstrate comparability of AS or FP, a 2 -tiered approach is proposed by the applicant. Initial comparability assessment (t ier 1) will consist of comparison of release and IPC results and some limited characterisation. If the release results of both pre - and post -change FP batches are within the commercial specifications, it will be concluded that the initial comparability cri teria are met and post -use lots will be Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 37/218 released for commercial use. This enables timely use of post- change materials to alleviate the high demand due to the COVID -19 pandemic. The additional characterisation test results (tier 2) will be provided post -approval. Given the COVID -19 pandemic and the current circumstances and urgency, this approach is deemed acceptable. In addition, the applicant also proposes a post- approval change management protocol (PACMP) to optimise the cell culture steps and to use new equipment for stage 7 (chromatography) and stage 8 (diafiltration) to increase the AS process capacity. Process validation protocols and stability protocols are provided and a similar comparability analysis with two tiers is proposed. The proposed PACMPs t o introduce and validate additional AS production sites and FP production sites using processes at a larger scale, as well as to optimise the large scale AS process to increase capacity, and to demonstrate comparability of AS/FP, are deemed acceptable. Finally, an additional PACMP has been proposed to add new QC testing sites. New QC sites will be qualified based on predefined analytical method validation or verification protocols. Compendial test methods will be verified at the new QC test site accordin g to pharmacopeial requirements. Non -compendial test methods will be transferred by co -validation or by comparative testing (i.e., equivalency). Acceptance criteria for test method validation will be at least equally strict as the acceptance criteria used during original method validation as described in the dossier. The applied acceptance criteria are deemed sufficiently stringent and thus adequate. This PACMP and the proposed approach to introduce and qualify additional QC testing sites is deemed acceptab le. Adventitious agents The applicant adequately described the adventitious agents' safety aspects. Adventitious agents' safety for Ad26.COV2.S is assured through the design and control of the manufacturing process: controlled selection and appropriate sp ecifications for raw materials and excipients, and specifications, in -process controls and release testing for starting materials, AS and FP. None of the raw materials used in the manufacture of the MVS, intermediate virus passage, WVS, inoculum, MCB, WCB, LVHD, AS, or FP batches was identified as being of direct animal or human origin. None of the excipients was of animal or human origin. However, one of the raw materials used in the manufacture of the MVS/WVS/AS (as a processing aid) was identified as inv olving animal- derived products in its production process: benzonase. It is demonstrated, though, that it does not present any adventitious agents safety risk. No transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) risk deriving from the use of these materials has been identified. With respect to microbial adventitious contamination (bacteria, fungi, mycobacteria, and mycoplasma), appropriate microbial controls are performed on the starting materials. Furthermore, all the solutions and buffers used in the downs tream process are manufactured aseptically according to cGMP referential conditions by a validated sterile filtration method and tested according to the European Pharmacopoeia. In addition, microbial controls are performed during the cGMP manufacturing. Ad equate controls and specifications for starting materials, raw materials and excipients, appropriate specifications, in -process controls, release tests, and validation of the relevant steps demonstrate that the MVS, WVS, AS and FP are prepared under condit ions designed to minim ise the risk of microbial contamination. With respect to adventitious viruses, the preMVS material has been tested for in vitro adventitious agents (on Vero, MRC -5, and HeLa cells); no viral contaminants were detected. Testing of the MVS with respect to viral safety is detailed. No viral contaminants were detected. The PER.C6 TetR -derived cell substrates have also been tested extensively tested by the general viral safety tests for adventitious or endogenous viruses/retroviruses and by PCR for specific human viruses. No porcine or bovine viruses were detected. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 38/218 The manufacturing process does not have a dedicated, validated viral clearance step. Because the product is a non -enveloped virus vector, it is not possible to implement specific (non -enveloped) viral clearance steps in the manufacturing process. The applicant has included RCA test as release test for the AS. TSE, viral and microbial safety has been suitably assured. GMO Refer to the ERA assessment report and section 2.3.5. 2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects The quality information for the COVID -19 Vaccine Janssen presented during the MAA has been thoroughly assessed. A list of questions was generated, which included three major objections, related to GMP, nitrosamine risk assessment and acceptance criterion for infectivity during shelf -life. Adequate responses were provided to address the major objections and other concerns and to support Conditional Marketing Authorisation. Additional validation, release an d comparability data have been submitted for AS and FP manufacturing sites. Necessary EU GMP certificates for the manufacturing and testing sites were subsequently provided. Further information is provided below on the resolution of the major objections a nd the rationale for accepting some open issues to be addressed as a specific obligation post -marketing. Several other issues are further highlighted as recommendations to be addressed by the applicant post -approval. In addition, it should be ensured that, in accordance with Annex I of Directive 2001/83/EC and Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the active substance and finished product are manufactured and controlled by means of processes and methods in compliance with the latest state of scientific and technical progress. As a consequence, the manufacturing processes and controls (including the specifications) shall be designed to ensure product consistency and a product quality of at least shown to be safe and efficacious in clinical trials and sha ll introduce any subsequent changes to their manufacturing process and controls as needed. The dossier is of acceptable quality however, certain information and data remain to be provided. Despite the short time frame of product development, sufficient dat a to support conditional marketing authorisation are provided and key areas requiring completion are explained below. These further data will be addressed in a specific obligation and other post -approval measures (recommendations). The Ad26.COV2.S AS and FP manufacturing processes and process controls are described in detail. Quality of process intermediates is adequately controlled by in -process controls. Both a small -scale AS process and a large scale AS process are included in the MAA. The following is sues have been addressed during the procedure: A major objection was raised with regards to the GMP compliance of AS and FP manufacturing sites. Proof of GMP compliance has been provided for all relevant sites . In addition, GMP inspections have been perfor med for and GMP certificates have been issued resolving the major objection. The small scale AS process at Janssen Vaccines and Prevention B.V. (Leiden, NL) and the large scale AS processes at Janssen Biologics B.V. (Leiden, NL) and Emergent Baltimore (US A) have been properly validated. In addition, production of the inoculum (used for the large scale process) has been validated and results from the 3 rd PPQ lot should be provided post -approval (recommendation 1 ). Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 39/218 The FP manufacturing process at the first commercial FP site is adequately validated. Some additional characterisation data to confirm homogeneity and the hold times should be provided post- approval (recommendation 7 ). With regards to the second commerci al FP site, batch data of the 3 PPQ lots were provided. All results were compliant with the FP specifications and also highly similar to release test results from phase 3 clinical lots and batches from the first commercial site. This is sufficient to support approval of the conditional marketing authorisation, in the context of the COVID -19 pandemic public health emergency, supporting a conclusion that the site can consistently manufacture FP. However, full PPQ data (including hold time) are required for th e second commercial site to complete the data package from this facility. These data are requested post -approval (specific obligation 1 ). Data supporting proven acceptable ranges (PAR) for CPP and non -CPP (nCPP) are provided. However, some parameters are still being evaluated and are classified as potentially critical. A final conclusion on the criticality of these parameters should be provided upon availability ( recommendation 10). Some process changes were introduced during clinical development and were qualified by a comparability analysis confirming the absence of any impact on product quality. Some further optimisations were introduced for the AS/FP processes that will be used for the initial commercial batches. To demonstrate comparability, the applic ant has used a 2 -tiered comparability approach that comprises a combination of release testing and additional characterisation testing. Both the results for release tests and characterisation tests were highly similar. Therefore, it can be concluded that t he AS lots from the commercial small scale process at Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V. (Leiden, NL) are comparable to the lots used in the Phase 3 clinical trials. Moreover, it was also shown that AS lots produced using the large scale processes at Janssen Biologics B.V. (Leiden, NL) and Emergent Baltimore (US A) were comparable to clinical AS lots and to AS lots small scale site . Tier 2 comparability data to confirm that the large scale AS (from Janssen Biologics B.V., Leiden, NL) is comparable to the small scale process material (from Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V. , Leiden, NL) ( recommendation 2 ) and tier 2 comparability data to confirm that the large scale AS (from Emergent, US A) is comparable to the AS from the other commercial AS sites ( recommendation 3 ) should be submitted post -authorisation. With regards to the FP manufacture, FP lots from the first FP site were shown to be comparable to the phase 3 clinical FP lots. Tier 2 comparability data for confirmation should be submitted post- authorisation (recommendations 6 ). In addition, a forced degradation study (thermal stress) is ongoing to support further comparability assessment between clinical Phase1/2 lots and phase 3 lots (recommendation 9). With regards to the second site, the batch release data (3 lots) are very consistent and also highly similar to release data from Phase 3 clinical lots and batches from the first commercial FP site and provide already some indication about the process validation and comparability. However, compara bility data (tier 1 and tier 2) are requested to confirm that the FP from the second commercial site is comparable to the FP from the first site and consequentially also confirm comparability with clinical material ( specific obligation 1). This approach is acceptable in the context of the COVID -19 pandemic public health emergency. FP release testing for endotoxin and sterility will be temporary performed in registered sites that are located in the US until 30 June 2021. From 30 June 2021 onwards, FP release testing for endotoxin and sterility will be performed by a site located in the EU . This is deemed acceptable in the context of the COVID -19 pandemic public health emergency . As it concerns compendial tests (endotoxin and sterility), suitability testing will be performed according to pharmacopoeial requirements for method transfer qualification. Annex II.A of the Product Information reflects this temporary exemption. The absence of evaluation of the risk of the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product in accordance with the published Art. 5(3) Referral on Nitrosamines was raised as a major objection. The Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 40/218 applicant has performed a risk assessment for both the AS and FP Manufacturing process with regard to possible nitrosamine impurities. Importantly, it concerns a biological process that does not contain any chemical synthesis steps. No nitrosating agent is used in the manufacturing process. Based on the AS/FP manufacturing process conditions and the nature of the starting materials, raw materials, excipients and equipment used, the risk for nitrosamines is considered negligible. A summary of this risk asse ssment of the elemental impurity level in the finished product in accordance with ICH Q3D should be provided post -approval (recommendation 13). A third major objection was raised on the need to revise the lower limit of the FP specification for infectious units. To address this issue the applicant has increased the infectious units release lower limit and the end of shelf life limit. In addition, the test for RCA has been included in the AS specifications. The upper limit for HCP (AS specification) has been revised. The specifications proposed for the AS and FP are deemed acceptable. However, it is expected that an acceptance criterion for polydispersity will be established and justified once sufficient experience and data for this parameter are available (recommendation 12). Since for immunogenicity and clinical efficacy the potency as expressed in infectious units is relevant, the potency of the vaccine should be expressed on the labelling in line with other viral vaccines. Hence, it was proposed to change labelling to \"not less than 8.92 log 10 Inf.U/dose\", instead of \"not less than 2.5\u00d71010 VP/dose\". The applicant agreed to express the labelling in Inf.U. Container closure systems of AS and FP were properly qualified. The applicant should provide the result s of the 6 month time point of the FP container leachables ( recommendation 11 ). A shelf life of AS when the AS is stored frozen was proposed by the applicant. The proposed shelf life for the FP is 24 months when stored frozen at - 25\u00b0C to - 15\u00b0C, and within these 24 months, 3 months when stored at 2 to 8\u00b0C. These shelf lives are based on platform data from similar Ad26 products. The currently proposed shelf lives for AS and FP are deemed sufficiently qualified and justified and are thus acceptable. Product -specific stability data will be generated and should be provided when available (recommendations 4 and 14). The proposed stability testing protocols are acceptable. Additionally, the applicant should provide data from photostability studies p ost-approval (recommendation 8). The applicant has provided PACMP protocols for addition and validation of new sites for AS and FP production at a larger scale. Process validation protocols include production of a minimum of 3 AS or FP lots for PPQ; acceptance criteria f or CPPs and critical material attributes must be met; results for IPC and release tests must comply with the acceptance criteria and the specifications. To demonstrate comparability of AS or FP, a 2 -tiered approach is proposed. Initial comparability assess ment (tier 1) will consist of comparison of release and IPC results and some limited characterisation. If the release results of both pre- and post -change FP batches are within the commercial specifications, it will be concluded that the initial comparability criteria are met and post -use lots will be released for commercial use. This enables timely use of post -change materials to alleviate the high demand due to the COVID -19 pandemic. The additional characterisation test results (tier 2) will be provided p ost-approval. Given the COVID -19 pandemic and the current circumstances and urgency, this approach is deemed acceptable. Furthermore, another PACMP has been provided to optimise the cell culture steps and to use new equipment for stage 7 (chromatography) and stage 8 (diafiltration) to increase the AS process capacity. Process validation protocols and stability protocols are provided and a similar comparability analysis with two tiers is proposed. The PACMPs and the proposed approach to introduce and validat e additional AS production sites and FP production sites using processes at a larger scale, as well as to optimise the large scale AS process to increase capacity, and to demonstrate comparability of AS/FP, is deemed acceptable. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 41/218 Finally, an additional PACMP has been proposed to add new QC testing sites. New QC sites will be qualified based on predefined analytical method validation or verification protocols. Acceptance criteria for test method validation will be at least equally strict as the acceptance criteria used during original method validation as described in the dossier. This PACMP and the proposed approach to introduce and qualify additional QC testing sites is deemed acceptable. All other issues raised during the procedure are considered solved and from quality point of view the marketing authorisation application for COVID -19 vaccine Janssen is acceptable. Impact on the benefit -risk assessment Efficacy, safety and immunogenicity was demonstrated using clinical batches of the vaccine.

Introduction The proposed candidate vaccine is an Ad26 vector with deletions in the early region (E1) of the Ad26 genome, rendering it replication incompetent. Th e Ad26.COV2.S vector contains a transgene in the E1A/E1B region which encodes a modified full -length SARS- CoV-2 spike (S) protein with stabilizing modifications, i.e. 2 amino acid changes in the S1/S2 junction that knock out the furin cleavage site, and 2 proline substitutions in the hinge region known to stabilise the prefusion conformation. The wild - type full -length S gene information was obtained from a SARS -CoV-2 clinical isolate (Wuhan, 2019, whole genome sequence NC_045512). Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 44/218 A similar Adenovirus typ e 26 (Ad26) vector encoding the glycoprotein (GP) of the Ebola virus Zaire (ZEBOV) Mayinga strain has been approved in Europe through Centralised Procedure (Zabdeno, INN: Ebola vaccine rDNA, replication -incompetent; Procedure No. EMEA/H/C/005337/0000). The current application concerns a single dose regimen. 2.3.2. Pharmacology Primary pharmacodynamic studies The non- clinical pharmacology of the Ad26.COV2.S candidate was evaluated in mice, rabbits, Syrian hamsters, and non -human primates (NHP) (rhesus monkey). Before selection of Ad26.COV2.S, different vaccine constructs with design elements previously shown to be successful for other coronavirus S protein -based vaccines were compared in in vitro and in vivo studies. The combination of the wild -type signal peptide, the furin cleavage site mutations, and the proline substitutions translated into superior immunoge nicity in mice, Syrian hamsters, and non -human primates (NHP) (Bos et al., 2020; Mercado et al., 2020; van der Lubbe et al., 2021). The in vivo testing in NHP showed that the design of Ad26.COV2.S was optimal in inducing robust neutralising antibody respon ses as well as protection following SARS -CoV-2 challenge (Mercado et al., 2020). Mice The murine model was used to examine immunogenicity by assessing antibody and cellular immune responses after immunisation, including T helper cell (Th) polar isation of the immune response. The mice used were aged 10 to 12 weeks, which is considered to correspond to adult age in humans. In study 9346- 20004, a dose level dependent induction of binding antibodies was observed at day 14 and 28 after vaccination. The stabiliz ing mutations present in Ad26.COV2.S compare favourably with binding antibody titers induced by a vaccine candidate coding for WT Spike protein, and this is confirmed in the virus neutralisation assay. Data from IFN- ELISpot and intracellular cytokine sta ining (ICS) assays show that T cell responses are induced, with a higher response in the CD8+ T cell compartment compared to the CD4+ compartment and indicate that IFN - is predominantly generated by CD8+ T cells. The second study (9346- 20007) was designed to determine the Th1/Th2 balance induced by a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S (1/5th of a human dose). Immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S was compared to recombinant adjuvanted S protein, known to induce a Th2 type immune response. Ad26.COV2.S was shown to induce the Th1 associated cytokine IFN - in ELISpot in contrast to alum adjuvanted Spike protein, 2 weeks post vaccination. The Th1 skewed immune response was demonstrated by a favourable ratio of IFN- to the Th2 associated cytokines IL -4, IL-5 and IL -10. In Balb/c mice, high IgG1 subclass with no IgG2a is associated with a Th2 response, whereas a balanced IgG2a/IgG1 ratio is indicative of a Th1 -directed response. The ratio of anti -S protein antibody IgG2a and IgG1 alum adjuvanted Spike protein, with high IgG2a levels observed only after Ad26.COV2.S vaccination. These results confirm the induction of a favourable immune response in view of a potential for vaccine associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD). NZW Rabbits An immunogenicity study in rabbits [study TOX14369 (TV -TEC-175060)] shows that immunisation with a dose corresponding to 1/10th or a full human dose induces an immune response towards the antigen of the i nsert, which qualifies this species as relevant for the toxicological assessment. In addition, a Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 45/218 second dose of vaccine 56 days after the first immunisation triggers a booster in both the humoral and cellular responses. Syrian hamsters In the two hamster e fficacy studies, the challenge dose was 102 TCID 50, which is lower than the dose reported in some publications (Sia et al, 2020, Tostanoski et al., 2020), but justified by results from Van der Lubbe et al. showing that a low dose challenge inoculum (102 TCID 50) induces a comparable viral load and disease compared with higher viral dose challenges. This dose was therefore selected to allow assessment of the occurrence of more severe disease in this model compared to NHPs and to evaluate the theoretical risk for VAERD. However, it actually conferred rather mild pneumonia without any clinical signs apart from body weight loss. The aim of the first challenge study performed in the hamster [TKO 707 (TV -TEC-175626)] was to compare immunogenicity and protection of Ad26.COV2.S with other Ad26- based candidate SARS -CoV- 2 vaccines, in a one - and two -dose schedule. Animals were challenged 4 weeks following immunisation and followed for 4 days after infection. This 4 -day follow -up period is also justified by prior studies (Van der Lubbe et al.), showing that a 4 -day follow up time after cha llenge is the most optimal time point to simultaneously evaluate lung tissue viral load and histopathology. A single immunisation with 1/50th or 1/5th of a human dose of Ad26.COV2.S induces S protein binding antibodies as of Week 2 post -immunisation. A s econd dose increased binding antibody titers but levels returned to those observed before the second dose within 4 weeks. A single immunisation with Ad26.COV2.S induced SARS- CoV-2 neutralising antibodies, starting at Week 2 and increasing at Week 4. In con trast to binding antibody titers, a second dose led to significantly higher neutralising antibody titers throughout the study period (challenge followed 4 weeks post -immunisation). Ad26.COV2.S given in a 1- dose or 2- dose regimen resulted in a lower lung v iral load compared with the Ad26.Empty mock -immunised animals. That load was below the limit of detection for the majority of animals immunised with Ad26.COV2.S. This reduction in viral load was however less apparent in the upper respiratory tracts as the presence of infectious virus after challenge was also detected in vaccinated challenged animals independent of the 1 - or 2-dose schedule. The results of histopathological examination confirm the viral load results, i.e. a 2 -dose regimen with Ad26.COV2.S i nduced a significant reduction in LRT histopathology scores and limited effects on URT histopathology scores after challenge. Due to a technical error only limited histopathology data are available for the 1 -dose schedule hampering any conclusion on the po tential benefits of a 2 -dose. Finally, there were no signs of VAERD observed in animals dosed with Ad26.COV2.S compared with the control group for any of the parameters assessed. Four days post inoculation, body weight loss was significantly reduced in animals vaccinated with a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S compared to controls, but this reduction was not evident in the 2 -dose group, compared with controls. Although the addition of a second dose 4 weeks after the first immunisation induces an increase in neutralising antibodies in the hamster model, a clear benefit in terms of weight loss reduction, viral loads or pathological scores could not be demonstrated in this model. Both in terms of immune responses and protection from infection, Ad26.COV2.S compared favourably with the other vaccine candidates tested in this study. The second hamster experiment [TKO 766 (study TV -TEC-176250)] was designed to determine the immunogenicity and efficacy of Ad26.COV2.S in a 1 -dose regimen in Syrian hamsters at different doses of 10 7 ,108, 109 or 1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S, with the highest dose corresponding to 1/5th of a human dose. The negative control groups received 1010 vp of an Ad26 vector not encoding any SARS -CoV-2 Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 46/218 antigens. In this study lower dose levels of A d26.COV2.S were included, with the aim of inducing suboptimal immune responses, allowing breakthrough viral replication in the lungs post inoculation with SARS- CoV-2. Under these conditions it can be investigated whether there is any increased risk for VAERD compared with a non -vaccinated control group. Viral load, body weight loss, and lung histopathology were measured after inoculation. In the present experiment as well, there were no illness signs, apart from body weight loss, which appears similar among all groups, only slightly reduced by vaccination. A single immunisation with Ad26.COV2.S led to dose level -dependent induction of S protein binding and neutralising antibodies, a dose level- dependent reduction in median lung viral load after inoculation with SARS- CoV-2 and a dose level -dependent reduction in LRT histopathology scores. A dose of 10 8 vp (or below) Ad26.COV2.S resulted in a breakthrough SARS -CoV-2 infection as measured by the viral load in lung tissue. If breakthrough infection occurred, no increase of viral load was noted compared with the infection in the control group. There was no indication of increased lung pathology in the vaccinated animals even at lower doses and no presence of eosinophils were noted upon histopathological analyses, showing that the presence of low levels of neutralising antibodies elicited by sub-optimal Ad26.COV2.S vaccine doses do not aggravate lung disease in challenged Syrian hamsters compared to controls. The conclusions appear similar to those for the previous experiment in hamsters, i.e. prior immunisation seems to protect animals mainly from a lower respiratory tract infection and it seems that the benefits of the vaccine in terms of upper respiratory tract protection are not clearly apparent, as measured by v iral load (infective and viral RNA material), histopathological scores and immunohistochemistry. The applicant also conducted a correlate of protection analysis showing that the binding and neutralisation titers inversely correlate to the viral loads and histopathology scores in the lower respiratory tract. The results published by Tostanoski et al . confirm some of the findings from the 2 studies reviewed above, i.e.; a single administration of 1/50 th or 1/5th of a human dose of the Ad26.COV2.S protects against severe disease and mortality in hamsters infected with a high dose of 5*105 TCID 50. The vaccinated animals showed a minimal interstitial pneumonia whereas the controls displayed moderate to severe multifocal pneumonia characterised by consolidation affecting 30 to 60% of lung parenchyma. This publication also confirms that humoral immune responses correlate inversely with lung viral load after challenge. Unlike in those previous studies, in this model a correlation of the humoral response with upper respiratory tract viral load was also identified. The efficacy of the vaccine in hamsters in terms of protection against body weight loss was not clear from the two previous studies in hamsters discussed above. In this paper however, it seems that prior immunisation protects against severe weight loss noted in the na\u00efve challenged animals ( -4% versus - 19.9%). This 4% loss in vaccinated animals actually looks similar to that reported in the above studies. It appears that prior immunisation of hamsters does n ot prevent a slight weight loss but seems efficacious to prevent an increased weight loss when severe disease is induced. The presence of the virus in the gastrointestinal tract was not assessed in either studies but are reported in Tostanoski et al. showi ng that prior immunisation with Ad26.COV2.S decreases the amount and time of detection of viral load in GI, spleen, liver and kidney compared to sham challenged animals. Based on the data presented in hamster immunogenicity and challenge studies we can co nclude that vaccination with one or two doses of Ad26COV2.S at 10 9 and 1010 vp 4 weeks prior to challenge protects the animals from mild to severe infection as noted by reduction of findings in the lower Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 47/218 respiratory tract (viral loads, histopathology and immunohistochemistry). The antibodies generated following vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S correlate with protection in the lower respiratory tract of hamsters. Their correlation with protection of upper respiratory tract is not clearly established. Non-human p rimates The NHP model assessed the immune response following one administration of the candidate vaccine and the protection following challenge. The high level of genetic homology between NHPs and humans, and their comparative immunology make NHPs a suitable model for studies of vaccine immunogenicity. In study NHP 20 -09, the NHPs were immunised IM with a single dose of 1011 vp Ad26.COV2.S (N=6) which corresponds to twice the human dose. A negative control group received saline only. The NHPs were inoculated with 1x105 -WA1/2020, the intranasal and intratracheal routes 6 weeks after immunisation. Although this study serves as non -clinical proof of concept, it appears that all animals remained healthy throughout the study and no clinic al signs or changes on pulmonary radiographs or in inflammatory parameters or even significant differences in scores upon histopathological examination are reported. In addition, a rapid decrease in viral load in both URT and LRT shown in sham immunised animals was also reported. This may be due to the fact that macaques only recapitulate moderate COVID -19 disease, the young age (3 -9 years) and healthy status of the animals and also given the low viral load used to inoculate the animals compared to published data. In conclusion, although the NHP challenge model is considered adequate to demonstrate immunogenicity, and viral clearance, it appears insufficient to demonstrate efficacy against the disease. It can be considered relevant for the modelling of asymp tomatic or mild to moderate forms of disease in humans. The immunogenicity results show that a single immunisation with Ad26.COV2.S induces antibodies against the S protein as well as neutralising antibodies. Regarding the cellular responses, they are considered as rather low and variable. The main efficacy read -out in the NHP study noted was the reduction of viral load in the upper and lower respiratory tract (URT/LRT) in the vaccinated animals as measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reactio n (RT -PCR) detecting sub- genomic SARS- CoV-2 mRNA (sgRNA). This viral load was below the limit of detection (LOD) in the LRT in 6/6 NHP immunised with Ad26.COV2.S, and in nasal load was below the LOD in 5/6 NHP. All control animals showe d detectable lung and nasal swab viral load after challenge. Rectal and throat swabs were not collected to assess the presence of the virus, and Luminex and ICS were not performed on BALs. This is unfortunate as those results would have been important for the assessment of the candidate vaccine absence of ERD potential (particularly in the absence of clinical disease in the controls). The histopathology findings were very mild especially in females of both groups and no histopathologic evidence of VAERD was observed in the NHP study. Some limited data were presented on the immune response 2 weeks post challenge (at week 8 post immunisation). These data showed that levels of neutralising antibodies post challenge seem to remain at a stable level while bindin g antibodies seem to increase after challenge. The cause for this discrepancy is unknown. Regarding the cellular immunity, ICS was performed 2 weeks post challenge but not analysed in favour of analysis of clinical ICS data. ELISpot results show a decrease 2 weeks after challenge, compared to the response observed before challenge (timepoint 4 weeks after immunisation; response in 5 out of 6 NHP). The applicant hypothesised that recruitment of specific T cells towards respiratory tracts could have reduced t he systemic cellular responses but this explanation remains only theoretical. NHP Study 20 -14 [study TV -TEC-176763] is a dose level titration study with Ad26.COV2.S, applying dose levels of 1x10 11 vp, 5x1010 vp, 1.125x1010 vp, and 2x109 vp, administered as a single dose, to Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 48/218 further character ise the relationship between humoral and cellular immunogenicity and protective efficacy. A single immunisation with Ad26.COV2.S dose level- dependently induced protection from SARS- CoV-2 infection in LRT and URT. Protection rate in the LRT was 100% within the groups that received either 1x1011 vp or 5x1010 vp Ad26.CoV2.S and 80% within the groups immunised with either 1.125x1010vp or 2x109 vp (N=5 per dose level). Protection rate in the URT was reduced at each dose level titration step, from psVNA) and binding (S or RBD ELISA) antibodies. T cell responses, measured by IFN - ELISpot, were also dose dependent but rather low and variable. Since a higher number of breakthrough infections was observed in the nose compared to the lung, these data suggest that protection in the upper respiratory tract may require higher vaccine doses offering a higher level of systemic immune responses. This study confirms that Ad26.COV2.S protect s from infection as demonstrated in study NHP 20 -09. In addition, a dose response relationship was demonstrated for immune markers as well as viral load. Vaccination of rhesus monkeys with Ad26.COV2.S at all dose levels followed by inoculation with SARS - CoV-2, was associated with considerably lower average lung pathology scores and the absence of virus-induced lung pathology, when compared to unvaccinated/sham -dosed challenged animals, demonstrating protection against viral challenge. It should be noted t hat the additional subgroup of control animals, with an age of 7 -8y (=efficacy only group), had higher average scores compared to the initial control group (PBS -vaccinated, and at the age of 5y like the vaccine groups); 33.2 versus 24.87 respectively. This is in line with viral loads in the LRT. Within these groups, there was considerable variability in lung histopathology scores, but there were no obvious differences between males and females. Thus, in the control animals in general but especially in the age- matched control group pneumonia induced after challenge was very mild and without clinical signs. In addition to the evidence of protection, vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S was not associated with an increase in the severity of lung findings (no increase in lung scores) even in animals having a breakthrough infection when compared to unvaccinated animals after challenge, indicating there was no histopathologic evidence of VAERD. Data from 3 NHP studies (NHP 20 -07, 20- 09 and 20- 14) were pooled for correlat e of protection analysis . The design of those studies is similar: NHP were vaccinated with a single dose of Ad26- based SARS -CoV-2 vaccine candidates (10 11 vp for study 20 -07 and 20- 09, dose titration range 1011- 2.109 vp for study NHP 20 -14), followed by ch allenge via intranasal and intratracheal route with same strain (USA -WA1/2020) at same dose (105 TCID 50) at week 6 or 7. Ad26.COV2.S was not evaluated in study NHP 20 -07 but 7 other Ad26 SARS -CoV-2 vaccine candidates were tested in comparable conditions. T he same immunogenicity assays (2 pseudovirus with pseudotyped particles made from a modified lentivirus backbone), 2 binding antibody ELISAs (full length -stabil ised assay (IFN- ELISpot) were used for samples obtained in all three studies. Also, the same assay was used to determine viral load in BAL and nasal swabs (RT -qPCR of SARS- CoV-2 E gene subgenomic ribonuc leic acid (sgRNA). Two logistic regression analyses were made independently: one dataset consisted of all vaccine candidates combined (N=51) and a second dataset containing only the Ad26.COV2.S candidate (N=26). Based on the data generated with the final vaccine candidate, derived from studies NHP 20- 09 and 20- 14, the dose dependent increases in humoral immune responses correlate with protection from infection, especially in the URT. Since dosing -down still offered protection from LRT infection, with only 2 vaccinated animals showing viral replication in the lungs (1 each in the two lowest dose groups), this comes with less precision of the logistic regression models for lung viral load. Correlation between tests Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 49/218 assessing neutralising and binding antibodi es has been demonstrated, and correlation of those markers with viral load is confirmed when the latter is expressed as a continuous instead of a binary variable. Binding antibody titers appeared to have a higher discriminatory capacity than neutralising a ntibodies. Neutralising antibody levels had the highest discriminatory capacity across all vaccine candidates combined from all studies. When comparing the overall analysis of all candidates to the analysis with the final candidate only, a correlation of T cell responses to protection was only shown in the latter. However, although a dose response relationship is indeed identified for the final vaccine candidate, it should be clear that the responses are not higher than those seen for other candidates in st udy NHP 20-07. For the logistic regression analysis of all candidates, it should be noted that interpretation of those results is less straightforward, especially because the final candidate was not part of study 20 -07, and it also builds on the assumption that the immune responses induced by the different candidates are qualitatively similar. For the logistic regression analysis of the final candidate only, as indicated above, precision of this logistic regression model is low for the lung as dose titration did not lead to the expected reduced LRT viral load. Both strategies are therefore considered complimentary, but these limitations may influence the weight that should be attributed to the outcome of the logistic regression analysis. However, the models have not been used to determine a threshold to apply to human data sets, which would probably require more robustness and further justification of the relevance of the animal model of infection, not disease. No unfounded claims have been made. The overall conclusion is supported: binding and neutralising antibody titers observed 4 weeks after immunisation with a single dose correlate with protection from infection in LRT and URT, when challenged in the short term. A passive transfer experiment in this NHP model shows that convalescent plasma dose -dependently protects from infection, indicating that humoral response induced after infection is sufficient for protection (McMahan et al .). Ad26 vaccine -induced neutralising or binding antibodies could thus be mechanistically involved in protection but it remains to be determined if vaccine -induced humoral response is sufficient for protection or alternatively that antibodies could also act as surrogate of the actual protective effector mechanisms that may well be multifactorial. Further evidence on the type of T cell response induced by vaccination was provided through a publication by Solforosi et al . (not peer reviewed). In this publication, a Th1 response was character ised by CD4+CD69+ T cells expressing IFN - and/or IL -2 and not IL -4, IL-5 and/or IL13 and a Th2 response was character ised by CD4+CD69+ T cells expressing IL -4, IL-5 and/or IL -13. Th1 skewing of the immune response is demonstrated in aged monkeys. Animals vaccinated with alum adjuvanted spike protei n also induced comparable levels of antigen specific Th1 cells, but unlike the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine, activation of Th2 cells likely occurred. A similar intracellular cytokine staining was used for human samples from the phase I/IIa clinical trial, equally d emonstrating Th1 skewing of the immune response (Sadoff et al . 2020). In addition, this publication describes that immune response and protection from challenge have been demonstrated in aged monkeys. These data support earlier studies, NHP 20- 09 and NHP 20 -14, with demonstration of protection in lower respiratory tract. It should be noted that in contrast to previous NHP studies, the G614 SARS -CoV-2 challenge strain was used. In study NHP 20 -14 a dose response relationship was shown for protection from inf ection in upper respiratory tract. In the current study, only a partial protection of the URT was observed in the vaccinated animals. The applicant suggested that several factors may have contributed to this finding, like age of the animals, time of the ch allenge and the strain used. A detailed assessment, in absence of a study report, is not possible at this stage but increase in temperature and signs of interstitial pneumonia in aged monkeys from the unvaccinated control group indicate that older age is a ssociated with a more severe disease compared to what was observed in control animals in previous studies in young adults. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 50/218 Preliminary results of an ongoing durability challenge in NHPs [study NHP 2020- 3373 (TV available (Roozendaal et al ., not peer reviewed). The applicant analysed whether vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S provides protection in macaques 6 months after the first vaccination, and whether the degree of protection could have been anticipat ed based on the derived correlates of protection, as described above (Logistic regression models; based on data from studies NHP 20- 07, 09 and 14). Groups of 7 macaques were vaccinated with either a one- dose (5x1010 vp or 1x1011 vp) or two-dose regimen (5x 1010 vp/dose) of Ad26.COV2.S with either a 4- week or an 8 -week interval between doses. Although there is not much detail, the protection conferred by one or 2 immunisations seems to last for at least 6 months after the first immunisation, as shown by the a ntibody titers and the viral loads measured in the BALs. The presence of replicating virus wa s measured in the noses of vaccinated animals at similar levels than in controls, however animals receiving two administrations of the vaccine 8 weeks apart had si gnificantly lower loads compared to the controls even though replicating virus is still measured as well in that group. There is good agreement between the observed protection 6 months after vaccination with the predicted protection probability in the lung based on both pre- challenge binding and neutralising antibody levels and correlate of protection models. In the nose, the predicted levels we re above those actually measured. Thus, the predictions for the probability of protection in the lower airways bas ed on binding and neutralising antibody levels is more robust than that for the protection in the upper respiratory tract. These findings are considered supportive. Secondary pharmacodynamic studies No studies on the secondary pharmacodynamics have been performed, which is in accordance with applicable guidelines. Safety pharmacology programme Safety pharmacology studies have not been performed with Ad26.COV2.S, since data (e.g., detailed clinical observations) from repeat- dose toxicity studies with Ad26.COV2.S and other Ad26- based vaccines did not suggest that these vaccines have a significant impact on physiological functions (e.g., central nervous system, respiratory, and cardiovascular functions) other than those of the immun e system. Therefore, and in line with the WHO guidelines on non -clinical evaluation of vaccines, stand - alone safety pharmacology studies are not deemed necessary. Pharmacodynamic drug interactions No studies on pharmacodynamic drug interactions have been performed, which is in accordance with applicable guidelines. 2.3.3. Pharmacokinetics Biodistribution studies were not performed with this specific COV2.S construct as formerly discussed and agreed during the scientific advices undertaken by the applicant. The b iodistribution profile of the Ad26 vector platform was evaluated in the rabbit using two Ad26- based vaccines encoding other antigens than the SARS -CoV-2 S protein. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 51/218 In the se biodistribution studies , one Ad26- based was administered at a dose of 5x1010 virus particles [vp], with animals sacrificed at Days 11, 61, or 91 following single IM injection, whereas for a second Ad26- based vaccine the animals received a dose of 1x1011 vp, with animals sacrificed on Days 11, 90, 120 or 180 following single IM injection of the vaccine. Tissues from these animals were harvested for analysis of Ad26 vector DNA using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q -PCR) assay. The results from both biodistribution studies show that the replication incompetent Ad26 vector does not widely distribute following IM administration in the animals. Vector DNA was primarily detected at the site of injection, draining lymph nodes and (to a lesser extent) the spleen. From these tissues, Ad26 DNA diminished slowly, with a small amount remaining in iliac lymph node of 1 animal at 180 days. In one of the studies, the vector DNA was below limit of detection in all other organs. Considering the removal of regions in the genome necessary for replication and the results of the two distribution studies performed with Ad26 platform, it is considered unlikely that the vector will replicate in human tissues. Notably, no biodistribution in gonads (ovaries and testes) was detected. In addition, both Ad26 -based vaccines tested in the biodistribution studies showed a similar pattern of (systemic) distribution and clearance when delivered via the IM route in the rabbit, despite carrying different transgene i nserts. The Ad26 vector backbone used for Ad26.COV2.S is identical to the vector backbone of the Ad26- based vaccines that were tested in the available biodistribution studies. The only difference between the vectors, apart from the encoded antigen transgen e, is the insertion of a tetracycline operon (TetO) motif in the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter sequence of the transgene expression cassette of Ad26.COV2.S. This is not considered to impact the biodistribution profile of the Ad26 vector. 2.3.4. Toxicology The n onclinical safety profile of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine has been assessed in two pivotal toxicology studies in New Zealand white (NZW) rabbits, a combined repeat -dose toxicity and local tolerance study, and a combined embryo -foetal and pre- and postnatal deve lopment (EF -PPND) toxicity study. Table 2 Overview of Toxicology Studies in Support of the Development of the Ad26.COV2.S Vaccine Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 52/218 Repeat dose toxicity A specific GLP -compliant repeat -dose toxicity and local tolerance study with Ad26.COV2.S (study TOX14382) was conducted in male and female NZW rabbits to evaluate its toxicity and to assess the potential reversibility, persistence or delayed occurrence of any findings 3 weeks after the last vaccination. The rabbits were injected IM with a control solution (0.9% sodium chloride) or 1\u00d710 11 vp Ad26.COV2.S on three occasions with a 14- day interval period (Days 1, 15 and 29). This dose and interval encompass the actual clinical dose and schedule, which is acceptable. The rabbit was also demonstrated to elicit an immune response to the antigen contained in the vector, which qualifies this species for the safety assessment of the present vaccine. Ad26.COV2.S administered on three occasions every 2 weeks at 1x10 11 vp/dose induced a transient inflammation consistent with an immunologic response to vaccination, i.e.: minimal hyperthermia and minimal body weight loss or lower body weight gain after injection, increases in plasma proteins (CRP, fibrinogen and globulins) and white blood cell counts (monocytes and lymphocy tes). Microscopic pathology findings showed increased lymphoid cellularity of germinal centers in popliteal and iliac lymph nodes and the spleen, also consistent with an immune response to the vaccine. Overall, the findings were considered non -adverse and were partially or completely reversible after a 3- week treatment -free period. The local changes consisted of transient local injection site dermal reactions associated with minimal to slight and reversible inflammation and haemorrhage at the injection si te. In conclusion, the repeat dose toxicity and local tolerance study did not highlight any unexpected findings. Those were mild, transient and as expected from a local/general inflammatory reaction subsequent to vaccination. Genotoxicity and carcinogenici ty No genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies were carried out, in line with relevant guidelines. Studies evaluating genotoxicity and carcinogenicity are normally not required for viral vaccines. Since no adjuvants or novel excipients are used in this pro duct, absence of those studies is considered acceptable. As regard Ad26 vector and its integration ability in nature, wild type adenoviruses do not integrate their genomes into the host cell chromosomes. With a few exceptions they replicate as linear, extra - chromosomal DNA (episomic) elements in the nucleus. The guideline on non -clinical testing for inadvertent germline transmission of gene transfer vectors EMEA/273974/2005 indicates that adenoviruses have traditionally been regarded as non -integrating. Reproduction Toxicity A GLP -compliant EF -PPND toxicity study (study TOX14389) was conducted in female NZW rabbits that received Ad26.COV2.S intramuscularly on Day 1 (i.e., 7 days prior to mating), followed by two vaccinations during the gestation period (i.e. GD 6, and GD 20). The design of this study was discussed with CHMP and considered appropriate. The rabbit is an acceptable model for developmental toxicity studies, and the dosing strategy ensures induction of a maternal immune response during mating and early gestation, evaluation of potential direct embryotoxic effects of the components of the vaccine formulation and the (direct) effects of the vaccine during late gestation, and a sustained maternal immune response up to lactation. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 53/218 There were no adverse effects of treatment on survival, clinical observations, body weight, body weight change, food consumption, reproductive performance, fertility, ovarian and uterine examinations, parturition, or macroscopic evaluations in parental females. No adverse effect of treatment was seen on foetal body weights, external, visceral, and skeletal evaluations on GD 29, or F1 kit evaluations from LD 0 -28 (sex ratios, survival, body weights, clinical findings, developmental evaluations, and macroscopic eval uations). The assay used for immunogenicity is a qualified SARS -CoV-2 spike ELISA. All immun ised animals and their foetuses had high SARS -CoV-2.S protein -specific antibody titers, indicating that maternal antibodies were transferred to the foetuses. While antibody titers of foetuses were comparable to that in the does, titers in kits (measured on LD28) were 1.3- fold lower. In conclusion, the reproductive and developmental toxicity study did not reveal any evidence of impaired female fertility and did not in dicate harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity, while exposure of dams and offspring was confirmed by detection of antibody in ELISA. Previous studies submitted with Ad26.ZEBOV vaccine in the rabbit did not highlight significant treatment related effects on reproduction or on F0 or F1 animals after administration 8 days prior to mating and at GD6. Local Tolerance No stand -alone local tolerance studies were submitted. This is acceptable and in line with relevant guidance on non -clinical vacci ne development since local tolerance was evaluated in a repeated dose toxicity study. 2.3.5. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment Ad26.COVS.2 is a recombinant Adenovirus26 that has been rendered replication -incompetent by deletion of the E1 region of the wi ldtype Ad26. Ad26.COVS.2 is produced in an E1 complementing cell line, without any DNA sequence overlap between the Ad26.COV.S vector and the cell line, thereby precluding the formation of replication competent adenovirus (RCA). RCA testing of drug substan ce DS was conducted for several small - and large -scale processes and the results complied with the acceptance criteria specifications. Both the non -replicative nature and the anticipated biodistribution profile upon intramuscular injection of Ad26COVS.2 i s assumed to minim ise co-infection events with wild -type adenoviruses, E1- complementing viruses or coronaviruses. An assessment of the effect and likelihood of recombination events concludes that resulting recombinants would either be non -replicative or will have no increased risk profile as compared to the circulating wild -type viruses that are present in the individual at the time of co- infection. While it is anticipated that exposure of unintended individuals to Ad26COVS.2 will be several orders of magni tude lower as compared to the dose administered for vaccination, results obtained with clinical trials completed so far indicate good tolerability and reveal no particular safety concerns distinct from other Ad26 -based vaccines. Risk management strategie s Even though the overall risk of Ad26.COVS.2 is deemed negligible, measures have been taken by the applicant to minim ise the likelihood of spread in the environment or to non -target individuals . The SmPC gives some guidance in relation to protection of p ersonnel during handling and administration, including disinfection of accidental spills in section 6.6: \"Potential spills should be Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 54/218 disinfected with agents with viricidal activity against adenovirus\". Since the environmental risks of Ad26.COVS.2 are negli gible, the inclusion of additional risk management strategies for reasons of environmental safety and safety of non -target individuals is not necessary. The overall risk for human (non -vaccinated individuals) and the environment under the proposed conditi ons of release of Covid -19 Vaccine Janssen is negligible. 2.3.6. Discussion on non- clinical aspects Pharmacology Ad26.COV2.S is an adenoviral vector that encodes a modified variant of the S protein that is stabil ised in its prefusion conformation. This vaccine construct was shown to induce superior immunogenicity in mice, Syrian hamsters, and non -human primates and protection following SARS -CoV-2 challenge in NHPs and hamsters compared to other vaccine candidates expl ored by the applicant . Immunogenicity of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine was tested in mice, rabbits, Syrian hamsters, and NHP. The vaccine elicits a dose -dependent binding and neutralising antibody response in the species tested and additionally induces a cellul ar immune response in mice, rabbits, and NHP, which is rather low and variable. The applicant showed that the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine elicited a Th1 skewed immune response in mice and NHP. The high level of genetic homology between NHP and humans, and their comparative immunology make NHP a suitable model for studies of vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy studies. The Syrian hamsters were selected as they are described as permissive to SARS -CoV-2 replication and display widespread lung pathology and clinical signs including weight loss. In contrast to the NHP model, shown to be an infection model but not suitable to demonstrate protection from disease, the hamster model shows more severe disease (Mu\u00f1oz -Fontela, C. et al., 2020). Challenge studies performed in NHPs have shown reduced viral load in the upper and lower respiratory tracts in vaccinated animals compared to controls. The NHP challenge model was considered adequate to demonstrate im munogenicity, and viral clearance, but appears insufficient to demonstrate efficacy against the disease. In a titration study in NHPs, a dose -dependent humoral immune response was demonstrated. While protection from infection in the lower respiratory tract was observed with little breakthrough cases even in the low dose groups, viral load in the upper respiratory tract was dose dependent. Preliminary results of an immunogenicity and efficacy study in aged NHP (VH808.681) have been provided through a manuscr ipt (Solforosi et al .) and indicate that immune responses induced by Ad26.COV2.S vaccination confer protection in older animals. Finally, preliminary data from an ongoing durability study indicate that the immune response lasts for at least six months and confers protection to lower respiratory tract infection (Roozendaal et al .). It seems that prior immunisation of NHPs confers protection more in the lower respiratory tracts compared to upper tracts 6 months after the first administration of the vaccine. Protection from upper respiratory tract infection was high shortly after vaccination of adult NHPs with high doses of Ad26.COV2.S (NHP 20 -09). However, the titration study (NHP 20- 14) with a dose level -dependent protection of URT suggested that protection in the upper respiratory tract may require higher vaccine doses offering a higher level of systemic immune response, compared to protection from LRT viral replication . Another study in older NHPs has also only shown partial protection of URT infection. In this new duration study, with only a small subsets of animals protected from URT viral replication, the applicant suggest ed that systemic binding and neutralising antibody levels likely are associated with a Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 55/218 distinct mechanistic correlate of protection in the nose early after vaccination, rather than being a mechanistic correlate of protection themselves. The applicant complemented the non -clinical package with two humoral immunogenicity and challenge studies in a SARS -CoV-2 Syrian hamster challenge model. Ad26.COV2.S significantly reduced viral load in the lung and lower histopathological scores compared with mock vaccinated controls. However, the difference was less apparent in the upper respiratory tract where viral load and histopathological findings we re not very different from unvaccinated animals. Like the experiments in the NHPs, the low challenge dose conferred rather mild pneumonia without any clinical signs in the unvaccinated control animals, apart from body weight loss in hamsters. Data from a dose level titration study performed in hamsters showed dose level -dependent reduction of efficacy and partial breakthrough infection in the lower respiratory tract at lower dose levels. The protection of vaccination against weight loss was not really appa rent in the 2 experiments reported here, however, some beneficial effects of Ad26.COV2.S on weight loss were noted in a study by Tostanoski et al. using a more stringent SARS -CoV-2 challenge dose, demonstrating significant protection when the body weight l oss is severe. It is additionally considered that the theoretical risk of SARS -CoV-2 vaccine -associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) has been sufficiently addressed by the a pplicant. The structure of the Spike coded by the vector stabilised in its prefusion conformation, the Th1 skewing of the immune response confirmed in mice, NHPs and rabbits as well as the absence VAERD noted in the challenge studies based on assessments of lung histopathology and absence of signs of clinical disease contribute to conclude that this risk is low. In both animal models, two different challenge strains were used, D614 which is related to the one expressed by the vaccine vector, and a G614 variant with higher infectivity. Protection from infection by emerging strains of interest will be addressed by assessing neutralising potential of clinical samples. Finally, the a pplicant showed that in both Syrian hamsters and NHP, the binding and neutralising antibodies elicited by Ad26.COV2.S correlated with protection from inf ection with SARS -CoV-2 as measured by viral load in the respiratory tracts. Because immunogenicity and efficacy data are available from clinical studies, these non -clinical data are for the most part superseded and considered supportive of this application . No assessment of a potential immune response toward the vector in itself was provided. Taking into account the available non -clinical and clinical platform data, as well as of clinical Ad 26.COV2.S- specific data, the a bsence of non -clinical insert- specific vector immunity data is considered acceptable and sufficiently justified. Pharmacokinetics The biodistribution profile of the Ad26 vector platform was evaluated in the rabbit using two other Ad26 based vaccines . Thes e platform biodistribution data are considered sufficient to inform on the biodistribution profile of Ad26.COV2.S, for which the same (replication incompetent) Ad26 vector backbone is used. This position has been confirmed and agreed in a previous Scientif ic Advice by EMA (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/369281/2020, dated 9 July 2020). It is further noted that the same platform biodistribution data were part of the MAA file for the Ebola vaccine component Ad26, Zabdeno (EU/1/20/1444/001). The Ad26 vector shows a limited dis tribution profile following IM injection, with detection at the site of injection, draining lymph nodes and (to a lesser extent) the spleen. Clearance (reflected by a downward trend in number of positive tissues and vector copies over time, to levels close to, or below Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 56/218 the detection limit of the q -PCR methods used) of the Ad26 vector was observed, indicating that the vector does not replicate and/or persist in the tissues following IM injection. Dissemination of Ad26 vector into breast milk or to/across th e placenta has not been specifically assessed in these non -clinical biodistribution studies. Even if a small quantity was excreted via the milk, it would not be considered as a risk, since Ad26.COV2.S is a non -replicating vaccine and does not encode a comp lete virus. Studies on absorption, metabolism and excretion were not performed, which is in accordance with the WHO Guidelines on the Nonclinical Evaluation of Vaccines. Toxicology The nonclinical safety profile of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine has been assesse d in two pivotal toxicology studies in New Zealand white (NZW) rabbits, a combined repeat -dose toxicity and local tolerance study, and a combined embryo -foetal and pre- and postnatal development (EF -PPND) toxicity study. Overall, the repeat dose toxicity and local tolerance study did not highlight any unexpected findings. Those were mild, transient and as expected from local/general inflammatory reaction subsequent to vaccination. It also did not reveal any effects on male sex organs that would impair male fertility. Female reproductive toxicity and fertility were assessed in a combined embryo -foetal and pre- and post-natal development study in the rabbit. In this study, a first vaccination of COVID -19 Vaccine Janssen was administered intramuscularly to fem ale rabbits 7 days prior to mating, at a dose equivalent to 2 -fold above the recommended human dose, followed by two vaccinations at the same dose during the gestation period (i.e., at gestational days 6 and 20). This EF-PPND toxicity study did not reveal any vaccine -related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo -foetal or offspring development. The parental females as well as their foetuses and offspring exhibited SARS -CoV-2 S protein -specific antibody titers, indicating that maternal antibodie s were transferred to the foetuses during gestation. No COVID -19 Vaccine Janssen data are available on vaccine excretion in milk. Dedicated male fertility studies are not routinely required for vaccines, and this is considered acceptable in this case as no concerns were raised in repeat dose toxicity study and biodistribution studies. Absence of juvenile animal studies is also acceptable since no target organs of toxicity have been identified. Neither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies were performed. The components of the vaccine are not expected to have genotoxic potential. Overall, the toxicology studies were adequate and in accordance with the WHO guidelines on non - clinical evaluation of vaccines and scientific advice. The vaccine -related effects noted were considered to reflect a normal, immunologic response consistent with vaccination. The nonclinical safety profile of Ad26.COV2.S is largely similar to the profile observed previously for other Ad26- based vaccines. 2.3.7. Conclusion on the non- clinical aspects No major non -clinical issues are identified in this application. A range of other concerns identified have been properly addressed by the applicant. The CHMP is of the view that non -clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 57/218 2.4. Clinical aspects 2.4.1. Introduction The trials performed by the applicant are still ongoing and all are random ised, placebo -controlled, and conducted in a double- blind fashion. The first- in-human VAC31518COV1001 is a Phase 1/2a to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S at 2 dose levels (5\u00d71010 vp and 1\u00d71011 vp). The data from this study supported the enrolment in the pivotal s tudy VAC31518COV3001. A Phase 1 trial VAC31518COV1002 evaluates the safety and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S. VAC31518COV2001 is a Phase 2a trial conducted in three EU countries to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate. Two Phase 3 trials, VAC31518COV3001 and VAC31518COV3009, evaluate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S in adults aged 18 years living in or going to locations with high risk for acquisition of Ad26.COV2.S infection. This report presents the prima ry efficacy and safety analysis from study VAC31518COV3001, which was performed once the required 2- month median follow -up was reached (reached on 22 January 2021). In addition, interim immunogenicity and safety analyses from studies VAC31518COV2001, VAC31 518COV1002 and VAC31518COV1001 are presented, as well as preliminary immunogenicity analysis for VAC31518COV3001.

Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 66/218 2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics According to the Guideline on clinical evaluation of new vaccines (EMEA/CHMP/VWP/164653/2005), pharmacokinetic studies are usually not requested for vaccines. 2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics relates to investig ation of immunogenicity. There is no established immunological correlates of protection (ICP) against COVID -19. Both the humoral and cellular immune responses are thought to be involved in the protection against COVID - 19, but their respective contribution in the protection or in the progression to/susceptibility of disease, and severe disease, are still poorly understood. Binding and neutralising antibody responses induced by Ad26.COV2.S vaccination correlate with protection as demonstrated in NHP and Syrian hamster challenge studies. Mechanism of action COVID -19 Vaccine Janssen (Ad26.COV2.S) is a monovalent vaccine composed of a recombinant, replication -incompetent human adenovirus type 26 vector that encodes a (S) glycopro stabilised the S glycoprotein of SARS - CoV-2 is transiently expressed, stimulating both neutralising and other functional S -specific antibodies, as well as cellular immune responses directed against the S an tigen, which may contribute to protection against COVID -19. Immunogenicity studies The immunogenicity data available so far were generated from a Phase 1/2a FIH trial conducted in Belgium and in the US (VAC31518COV1001), a Phase 1 trial conducted in Japan (VAC31518COV1002), a Phase 2 trial conducted in Spain, the Netherlands, Germany, UK (VAC31518COV2001), and one of the Phase 3 trials (VAC31518COV3001). No immunogenicity results are available for the second ongoing VAC31518COV3009 Phase 3 trial. Data from all trials are interim results. Both the immunogenicity assays and the studies (design and results) are discussed in the next sub - sections. Assays used to evaluate immunogenicity Depending on the study, the main immunogenicity objectives of the ongoing st udies are to assess humoral immune responses in terms of neutralising antibodies, measured by wtVNA, and of S -specific binding antibodies, measured by S -ELISA, as well as to assess cellular immune responses, measured by ICS and/or ELISpot. In VAC31518COV1001 and VAC31518COV1002 studies, and in participants at selected sites in study VAC31518COV3001, the presence of neutralising antibodies to the Ad26 vector backbone was measured using the Ad26 VNA. Additional antibody functionality has been investigated by means of ADCP. An SARS- CoV-2 N-ELISA was used for the detection of asymptomatic infection. Timepoints for blood samples were variable across studies. Samples were taken at baseline and 28 days post -vaccination. Additional samples were also taken , including at days 14, 56, 70, or 85 days as Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 67/218 well as 6 and 12- 14 months post -first vaccination in the VAC31518COV1001 and VAC31518COV2001 study studies. An overview of the immunological assays used (or that will be used) in clinical studies is presented in the Table below. Table 4. Summary of Immunogenicity assays Sample interpretation and responder definitions were as follows: Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 68/218 Table 5. Overview of sample interpretation 2.4.3.1.1. First-in-human VAC31518COV1001 study In the following sections of this report, the vaccine groups will be abbreviated as follows: 5\u00d71010, 5\u00d71010 vp 1\u00d71011 vp, followed by placebo PL, PL group: placebo, followed by placebo Cohort 1a was conducted for dose selection in young adults and Cohort 3 in the older adults. The selection of the optimal dose level and schedule was to be based on the safety and immunogenicity results observed in baseline SARS -CoV-2 seronegative participants. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 69/218 Immunogenicity evaluation Venous blood samples are to be collected at baseline, at 14, 28, 56 (vaccination 2), 7 0, 84 days post - dose 1, and at months 6 and 12 post -dose 2 for the assessment of humoral and cellular immune responses. For purposes of analysis, the following populations are defined: FAS: The full analysis set will include all participants with at least one vaccine administration documented. PPI: The per protocol immunogenicity population will include all random ised and vaccinated participants for whom immunogenicity data are available excluding participants with major protocol deviations expecting to impact the immunogenicity outcomes. Analysis of the immunogenicity results was based on the per protocol immunogenic ity population (Cohort 1a) or the full analysis set (Cohort 3), consisting of all random ised and vaccinated participants for whom immunogenicity data were available. Cohort 1a (Adults aged 18 -55 years) The data provided by the applicant are the following: SARS- CoV-2 neutralising antibodies and S protein binding antibodies at baseline and Days 29, 57, 71 and 85. Ad26 neutralising antibodies at baseline and Day 57. ADCP and T cell responses (ICS) at baseline, Day 15 and Day 29. IFN and IL -4 respon ses (ELISpot) at baseline and Day 15. (i) Humoral responses Neutralising Antibody Responses to SARS -CoV-2: Neutralising antibodies to wt SARS -CoV-2 were measured in a wtVNA assay. Samples of 25 participants (random subset) per group were analysed. Fifteen participants in Cohort 1a were SARS CoV -2 seropositive at baseline and only one of these was in the subset of 125 participants analyzed by wtVNA. Detectable levels of neutralising antibodies were observed in a minority of participants at baseline. Descrip tive statistics of the actual values (GMTs with corresponding 95% CIs) and percentage of responders over time are provided by vaccination group in the Table below. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 70/218 Table 6. SARS -CoV -2 neutralising wtVNA Binding Antibody Responses Against SARS- CoV-2 S Protein: Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 71/218 Binding antibodies to the SARS -CoV-2 S protein were measured by ELISA. Samples of 75 participants per group were analysed. Out of the 15 participants in Cohort 1a were SARS CoV -2 seropositive at baseline, 2 were defined as seropositive by screening serology alone, being negative by baseline S -ELISA. Descriptive statistics of the actual values (GMTs with corresponding 95% CIs) and percentage of positive samples over time are provided by vaccination group in the Table below. Table 7. S-ELISA Neutralising antibody titers correlated highly with binding antibody concentrations at Day 29 and Day 71. The Spearman correlation at both timepoints was >0.80. Functional Antibody Character isation : Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page Antibody -dependent cellular phagocytosis of SARS Spike antigen was measured by an ADCP assay. Samples of 75 participants per group were analysed. Figure 4. SARS -CoV-2 S -ADCP (phagocytic score) Correlation analysis demonstrated a positive correlation between ADCP (phagocytic score) and neutralising antibody titers (IC50), with a Spearman correlation of 0.75. A strong positive correlation between phagocytic score and binding antibody titers (EU/mL ) was also demonstrated (Spearman correlation =0.856). Pre-existing immunity and Responses to Ad26 Backbone: Neutralising antibodies to the Ad26 backbone vector were measured using the Ad26 VNA at baseline and prior to second vaccination on Day 57. Four participants had pre -existing levels of Ad26- neutralising antibodies LLOQ. At Day 57 Ad26- neutralising antibodies LLOQ were detected in more than 95% of participants in the active vaccine groups, compared to 9% of those in the PL, PL group. Correla tion analysis of Ad26 neutralising antibodies pre- dose 2 vs. SARS- CoV-2 neutralising antibodies post-dose 2 showed a poor correlation between the two variables (r= -0.25 at Day 71 and r= -0.29 at Day 85). Neutralising Antibody Responses to SARS -CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage (variant 20I/501Y.V1): Neutralising antibodies capable of inhibiting live virus infections by the SARS -CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage (variant 20I/501Y.V1) were assessed in samples of Cohort 1a as part of the exploratory analyses with a non -qualified assay . No LLOQ was determined and no responder definition is applied. Neutralising antibody titers against SARS -CoV-2 are expressed as IC50 units. Samples from VAC31518COV1001 Cohort 1a were selected for the measurement of neutralising antibodies directed again st the B.1.1.7 lineage. In particular, samples showing high titers in the Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 73/218 Victoria/1/2020 wtVNA were selected 28 days post -dose 1 (Day 29, n=8), 70 days post -dose 1 (i.e. 14 days post -dose 2, Day 71, n=24). Neutralising antibody titers against SARS -CoV-2 B1.1.17 were detectable in all samples from the active groups, while all placebo samples were below detection. For the 6 Day 29- samples of the 5\u00d71010 vp, PL group, nAb GMT observed in the Victoria 1/2020 VNA was 573 (95% 268- 1,226) whereas the lineage VNA was 65 (95% CI: 30-141). For the 14 Day 71- samples of the 5\u00d71010 vp, PL group, nAb GMT observed in the Victoria 1/2020 VNA was 375 (95% CI: 271- 519) whereas the GMT observed in the B.1.1.7 lineage VNA was 113 (95% CI: 82-155). For the 6 Day 71- samples of the 5\u00d71010, 5\u00d71010 vp group, nAb GMT observed in was 1,656 (95% 1,046- 2,622) whereas was 398 (95% CI: 282- 561). immune T -cell Responses by ICS: The induction of CD4+ and CD8+ T -cell responses was determined by ICS at baseline, Day 15 and Day 29 post -dose 1. PBMCs were collected from a subset of participants for this analysis (n=196). Profiles for CD4+ T cells expres sing IFN and/or IL -2 (Th1), but not Th2 cytokines, and CD8+ T cells expressing IFN and/or IL -2 in response to SARS -CoV-2 S peptide stimulation are presented below. Median CD4+ Th2 (CD4+ T cells expressing IL -4 and/or IL -5/IL-13 and CD40L) responses were undetectable at Day 1, Day 15 and Day 29 in all vaccine groups. The Th1/Th2 ratio was above 1 for all participants in the active vaccine groups. Figure 5. Percentage of CD4+ Th1 cells Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 74/218 Figure 6. Percentage of CD8+ Th1 cells -4 by IFN IL -4 ELISpot quantification, respectively, in 375 subjects. ELISpot results confirmed the results observed by the ICS method, an induction of Th1 cells responses in most of the vaccinated subjects, and overall comparable between groups. The Th1/Th2 ratio was above 1 for all participants in the active vaccine groups. Cohort 3 (Adults aged 65 years) The data provided by the applicant are the same as for Cohort 1a, with some differences on the days at which some of the blood draws have been carried out. There are no immunogenicity data post- dose 2 except for the sentinel participants. When interpretin g the Day 57 results from Cohort 3, it is important to note that, due to the study pause, Day 57 blood draws for immunogenicity were delayed for the majority of participants. Data within the defined per protocol Day 57 visit window (57 \u00b13- 7 days post vacci nation) are available for 15 participants only (n=3 per group). For the remaining participants, the actual timing of the Day 57 blood draw ranged from 86 to 107 days post -vaccination (median visit = Day 87). Therefore, data presented below for Cohort 3 are based on the FAS instead of the PPI set, ie, including data from participants out of window for the Day 57 blood samples. (i) Humoral responses Neutralising Antibody Responses to SARS -CoV-2: Samples of 25 participants per group were analysed. Neutralising antibody responses against SARS -CoV-2 over time are graphically presented in the Figure below. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 75/218 Figure 7.

Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 77/218 Figure 9. SARS -CoV-2 S -ADCP (phagocytic score) Correlation analysis demonstrated a high correlation between ADCP (phagocytic score) and neutralising antibody titers (IC50), with a Spearman correlation of 0.7 2. A strong correlation between phagocytic score and binding antibody titers (EU/mL) was also demonstrated (Spearman correlation =0.80). Pre-existing immunity to Ad26 Backbone: Of the Cohort 3 participants, 23 had pre- existing levels of Ad26- neutralising antibodies. (ii) Cellular immune responses CD4+ T and CD8+ T -cell Responses by ICS: PBMCs were collected from a subset of 200 participants for analysis of cellular immune responses (n=40 per group). CD4 Th1 cells were detected at Day 15 and the proportion of positive samples slightly increase up to 28 days post -vaccination. At Day 15, the proportion of positive samples ranged from 59% to 63% and from 63% to 74% at Day 29. Median responses were also comparable between groups at Day 15 (0.07%- 0.09%) and remained stable up to Day 29 (0.09%- 0.10%). Median Th2 responses were undetectable at Day 1, Day 15 and Day 29 in all vaccine groups. The Th1/Th2 ratio was above 1 for all participants in the active vaccine groups. CD8 Th1 cells were detected at Day 15 and their proportion further increased up to 28 days post - vaccination. Proportion of positive samples ranged between 49% and 65% at Day 29. Median responses ranged between 0.06% and 0.11%. Regression Analyses of Antibody Responses on Demographic and Baseline Characteristics Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 78/218 The effect of demographic and baseline characteristics on both neutralising and binding antibody responses was examined on pooled data from Cohort 1a and Cohort 3 at Day 29 (n=198 and 598 for nAb and binding Ab, respectively), and on data from Cohort 1a at Day 57 and Day 71 (n=98 and n=278 for nAb and binding Ab, respectively). A p- value of <0.05 was taken to indicate a statistically significant effect. However, it should be noted that neutralising and binding antibody responses were observed in all subgroups and that the assessment of the clinical relevance of the observed differences between subgroups is difficult. No statistically significant differences in neutralising and antibody responses were observed for race or BMI. Males mounted significantly lower nAb and binding Ab responses than females. Age did not significantly impact nAb levels at any timepoint whereas older participants showed lower levels of binding Ab at Day 29 and Day 57 timepoints. At Day 71, no impact of age wa s observed on neutralising or binding antibody responses based on the regression analysis. However, when comparing neutralising antibody response in Cohort 1a and Cohort 3, a trend for decreased neutralising antibody response (GMTs) was observed in partici pants 65 years old compared to 18- 55- year-old participants at Day 57. Baseline SARS- CoV-2 serostatus also significantly impacted levels of neutralising and binding Ab at all 3 timepoints (with the exception of Day 71 for the binding Ab). This should be in terpreted with caution since there were only a small number of baseline seropositive participants. However, this is not counter -intuitive. Ad26.COV2.S dose level did not significantly impacted levels of nAb whereas it did for binding Ab at all 3 timepoints . As expected, number of administered active vaccine doses had a highly significant impact on both neutralising and binding Ab levels. 2.4.3.1.2. Study VAC31518COV1002 Immunogenicity evaluation Venous blood samples were/are to be collected for determination of immune responses in Cohorts 1 and 2 at pre- specified timepoints (14- and 28- days post -dose 1, prior dose 2, 14- and 28- days post - dose 2, 6 months post -dose 2 and 12 months post -dose 1. The data on SARS- COV-2 and Ad26 nAb for Cohort 1 were provided by the applica nt. No formal hypothesis on immunogenicity will be tested. The immunogenicity analyses will be performed on the PPI population. Immunogenicity analyses will also be done on the FAS. Analysis of the immunogenicity results was based on the PPI population. Ba seline and post -first vaccination immunogenicity results were provided in 5\u00d710 10 vp (n=51), 1\u00d71011 (n=50) and placebo (n=24) respectively. Humoral immunogenicity Neutralising Antibody Responses Against SARS -CoV-2: Detectable baseline levels of SARS -CoV-2 IC50 titers, potentially indicative of previous SARS -CoV-2 exposure, were observed in 1 participant in the 5\u00d71010 vp vaccine group, 6 participants in the 1\u00d71011 vp vaccine group. Descriptive statistics of the actual values and percentages of responders are provided by vaccine group in the table below x. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 79/218 Table 8. SARS -CoV -2 neutral isation wtVNA Pre-existing immunity to Ad26 Backbone: Detectable baseline levels of Ad26 nAb were observed in 4 out of 125 participants. 2.4.3.1.3. Study VAC31518COV2001 In adults, the immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S in 1 - and 2 -dose vaccination regimens followed single low-dose immun isation after 4 months (2 -dose regimen) or 6 months (single -dose regimen), will be evaluated across 4 dose levels and vaccination intervals (1x1011 vp, 5x1010 vp, 2.5x1010 vp, and 1.25x1010 vp). In adolescents, the immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S in a 1 - and 2 -dose vaccination regimen followed by a booster vaccination 12 months after the first vaccination, will be evaluated for 2 different dose levels (5x1010 vp or 2.5x1010 vp). The applicant did not presented results for the adolescents part of this CMA . Immunogenicity assessment Venou s blood samples are to be collected at baseline, at 14 and 28 days post-dose 1, the day of the vaccination 2 (day 57 ), at 7, 14 and 28 days post -dose 2, the day of the third injection (antigen presentation), at 7 and 28 days post -dose 3, at 6 months post -dose 3 and 12 months post -dose 2 for the assessment of humoral and cellular immune responses. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 80/218 Venous blood samples were collected for assessment of humoral immune responses in all participants whereas cellular immune responses will be assessed in a subset of adult participants. The data on SARS- COV-2 nAb were provided by the applicant. The immunogenicity analyses are descriptive and are performed on the PPI population. Immunogenicity analyses are also done on the FAS. Humoral immunogenicity Neutralising Antibody Responses Against SARS -CoV-2: Wild-type VNA data was available from a subset of participants from Groups 1 - 6 (n=40 per vaccine groups, n= 15 for the Placebo group). Data from vaccine Groups 1 and 5 (5x1010 vp) were pooled. Table 9. SARS -CoV -2 neutral isation wtVNA A trend for lower positive sample rate, responder rate and GMTs was observed in subjects of 65 years of age and over, for all dose levels, when compared to the younger 18- 55 years of age subjects. 2.4.3.1.4. Phase 3 study VAC31518COV3001 This section focuses on the immunogenicity assessment. See section clinical efficacy, main study, for further study description. Blood is to be collected from all non -Immunogenicity Subset participants for humoral immunogenicity assessments at Day 1 (pre -vaccination), Day 29, Day 71, 6 months, and 1 year after vaccination. For a total of approximately 400 participants in the Immunogenicity Subset (i.e., participants at sites with access to appropriate processing facilities), blood samples are to be col lected for analysis of Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 81/218 humoral immune responses on Day 1 (pre -vaccination), Day 29, Day 71, 6 months, 1 year as for the non-immunogenicity subset, and also at 18 months, and 2 years after vaccination. During a COVID -19-episode, blood is to be collected on COVID -19 Day 3- 5 and on COVID -19 Day 29 for immunogenicity assessments (for biomarker evaluation). A serologic test for past or current infection with SARS -CoV-2 is to be performed for all participants at Day 1 (pre -vaccination), Day 29, Day 71, 6 months, and 1 year after vaccination. Immunogenicity subset Participants in the Immunogenicity Subset are divided into 4 groups as presented in the table below. Table 10. Sample size and distribution of the immunogenicity 50 50 50 Placebo 50 50 50 50 Total 100 100 100 100 vp = virus particles Subset 1a: healthy 18 - to <60 -year-old adults comorbidities , enrolled Subset 1b: <60 -year-old enrolled during Stage 2a: healthy 60 during Stage led during Stage 2b. Correlates subset Correlates of risk of COVID -19 will be assessed in a subset including all vaccine recipients who experience a SARS -CoV-2 event, and random samples of vaccine recipients who have not been infected. Correlates of infection or disease/disease severity, or pro tection will also be investigated. No formal statistical testing of the immunogenicity data was planned. All immunogenicity analyses are to be performed on the PPI set. Changes in planned analyses As an increase in SARS -CoV-2 infection rate was observed during the study at specific Brazilian sites (sites BR10003, BR10004), there were concerns that regional differences in vaccine efficacy would be observed at the moment of the primary analysis. Evident reasons for these differences, outside of environmenta l, would be lower protection against SARS -CoV-2 viral variants and/or lower vaccine immunogenicity; therefore, the applicant decided to evaluate Ad26.COV2.S immunogenicity by measuring S -specific binding antibodies at Day 1 and Day 29 post -vaccination in p articipants randomly selected from these sites as well as other random Brazilian sites, South African sites, and US sites. In addition, as seroprevalence of Ad26 is known to differ in different regions, an analysis of pre -existing Ad26 immunity, measured by Ad26 neutralising antibody titers at Day 1, was also performed to determine if there was a high prevalence of pre- existing Ad26 neutralising antibodies at baseline. All these analyses were planned and performed before the database lock. Humoral immunogenicity Binding Antibody Responses Against SARS -CoV-2 S Protein: At the time of primary analysis, only preliminary immunogenicity data were available. Data that are presented are those of participants randomly selected from the two main Brazilian sites as well as other random Brazilian sites (n=188, different sites), South African sites (n=118), and US sites (n=74). Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 82/218 Overall, similar SARS -CoV-2 S binding antibody levels and responder rates were observed across different countries and regions (see Tabl e below).

Positive sample refers to a quantifiable response (sample interpretation). The assay status is: \"validated\". Pre-existing immunity to Ad26 Backbone: Ad26 nAb titers at baseline were measured for participants from Brazil and the US. Among the US participants, only 2.0% in the active vaccine group and 4.2% in the placebo group, were seropositive. Participants from Brazil had an overall Ad26 seroprevalence of 32.5% and 28.4% in the active vaccine group and placebo group, respectively. Among the 27 Brazilian participants with dete ctable Ad26 95.8]) were vaccine responders as measured by S -ELISA at Day 29. Among Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 83/218 the 59 Brazilian participants with no detectable Ad26 neutralising antibodies at baseline, 59 (100% [95% CI: 93.9; 100]) were vaccine responders as measured by S -ELISA at Day 29. A low negative correlation (Spearman correlation of - 0.378) was observed between S binding antibody levels at Day 29 post vaccination and pre -existing Ad26 neutralising antibodies at basel ine. This is consistent with the overall comparable GMT values observed at D29 post -vaccination between the US site and the Brazilian sites. 2.4.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology All interim immunogenicity data available were generated from a Phase 1/2a FIH trial, a Phase 1 trial, a Phase 2 trial, and a Phase 3 trial (VAC31518COV3001), up to 3 months post -dose 1. No immunogenicity results are available for the second ongoing VAC31518COV3009 Phase 3 trial. This is acceptable for the cMA, but longer follow -up data should be provided with final CSRs. Study VAC31518COV1001 is an ongoing random 1/2a multicentre first- in-human (FIH) dose selection study conducted in adults aged 18 to 55 years (n=670) and aged 65 years (n=375) in Belgium and in the US. Based on platform experience, the dose levels of 5x1010 vp and 1x1011 vp, both administered as a 1- dose and a 2 -dose regimen, were selected. This study also includes an evaluation of a single booster vaccination. Study VAC 31518COV1002 is a random ised, double- blind, placebo -controlled, Phase 1 trial conducted in adults aged 20 to 55 years (n=125) and 65 years (n=125). Two dose levels were tested in a 2-dose schedule in Japan. Study VAC31518COV2001 is an ongoing random ised, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multicentre Phase 2a study conducted in Germany, the Netherlands and Spain. Adults aged 18 to 55 years, and adults in good or stable health aged 65 years and older are being enrolled (n=625). Immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2 .S in 1 - and 2 -dose vaccination regimen will be evaluated across a range of dose levels and vaccination intervals. A single low -dose immun isation with 1.25x10 10 vp Ad26.COV2.S to mimic antigen presentation, will be administered 4 months after the second va ccination to all participants in all active vaccine groups to assess the immune memory. It is unclear why the anamnestic response will be assessed with a shorter interval between the primary vaccination and the antigen presentation for the 2 -dose schedule when compared to the 1- dose schedule. This should be clarified by the applicant as soon as possible (see list of recommendations ). The design of the 4 clinical trials are overall considered adequate for the character isation of the immune responses induced following Ad26.COV2.S administration. In addition, Ad26.COV2.S -induced immune responses will be assessed in a subset of participants of study VAC31518COV3001 (see efficacy section for further details on the design). Overall, the main immunogenicity obje ctives consisted in the assessment of humoral (neutralising and binding Ab) and cellular (Th1, Th2) immune responses, which are both thought to be involved in the protection against COVID -19. Their respective contribution in the protection or in the progression to/susceptibility of disease, and severe disease, is still poorly understood. Timepoints for blood samples were variable across studies. Samples were taken at baseline and 28 days post -vaccination. Additional samples were also taken, among others, at days 14, 56, 70, or 84 days post -first vaccination in the VAC31518COV1001 and VAC31518COV2001 study studies. Blood will also be taken at later time -point, i.e. at months 6 and 12 post -dose 1/2. Sampling schedules are appropriate to determine the kinetic of the immune responses. The immunogenicity analyses are Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 84/218 descriptive and were performed on the PPI population, or on random subset of participants (VNA analysis) or on an immunogenicity set of participants at selected sites in VAC31518COV3001. The assays used include measure of the humoral response to the S protein in terms of binding antibodies (by ELISA), functional antibodies (Virus neutralisation assay, Antibody -Dependent Phagocytosis Assay to measure Fc- mediated viral clearance), and neutralis ing antibodies against the Ad26 vector. Moreover, the cellular immune response (CD4+ and CD8+) induced has been character ised by two assays (ICS and ELISpot), which would allow determining whether the induced response was Th1 - or Th2 -polarised. Overall, th e assays selected for both measures (humoral and cellular response) are endorsed. The main assays were qualified or validated. The wtMNA validation is ongoing. Additional reports and information should be provided by the applicant as soon as possible (see list of recommendations ). A new SARS- CoV-2 MNA based assay was developed, using a different strain, i.e. the variant 20I/501Y.V1 (B.1.1.7 lineage). nAb assessment should also include testing against other variants of concern, at least 20H/501Y.V2, 20J/501Y .V3 and 20B/S.484K (P.2 Brazilian variant) as well as against contemporary variants of concern. Assessment of nAb to these different strains is recommended to be performed on, at least, the samples of the Phase 3 trial, for which efficacy data against these variants are also available. The applicant is requested to present their plans as soon as possible (see list of recommendations ). In study VAC31518COV1001, a total of 377 and 403 subjects were randomi sed and vaccinated in Cohort 1a and Cohort 3 respectiv ely. A total of 125 and of 584 were enrolled and vaccinated in study VAC31518COV1002 (Cohort 1) and study VAC31518COV2001. The treatment discontinuation rate was <4.0% (range: 0.8% to 3.7%) in any of the studies/cohorts. There were no major relevant differ ences in baseline or demographic characteristics between the vaccine groups, including placebo, in any of the studies/cohorts. In study VAC31518COV3001, 43,783 subjects were vaccinated. For further information, see efficacy section. The submitted interim r eport of study VAC31518COV1001 contains immunology data through Day 85 (post-dose 1 and post -dose 2 data) for all participants in Cohorts 1 (aged 18 to 55 years) and through Day 57 for participants in Cohort 3 (aged 65 years , no data post -dose 2). Of no te, for Cohort 3, the actual timing of the Day 57 blood draw ranged from 86 to 107 days post vaccination due to study pause (median visit = Day 87). For studies VAC31518COV1002, VAC31518COV2001, and VAC31518COV3001, the submitted interim reports contain av ailable immunogenicity data collected through 28 days post -dose 1. Selection of the dose, meeting pre- specified criteria, was based on immunogenicity (nAb response rate and Th1/Th2 ratio) and safety data up to 28 days post -dose 1 immunogenicity from Cohort 1a and available data from Cohort 3 of study VAC31518COV1001. Subsequent t rials VAC31518COV1002 and VAC31518COV2001 have also evaluated two dose levels of 5\u00d710 10 vp and 1\u00d71011 vp. In trial VAC31518COV1001, neutralising antibody response rates were high for both dose levels (5\u00d71010 vp and 1\u00d71011 vp) and overall comparable between age categories (younger and the older adults >65 years of age ) at 28 days post -first vaccination. A trend for higher GMT with the higher vaccine dose was observed in the young adults enrolled in the Phase 1 study conducted in Japan. This might however be explained by different factors, such as the higher proportion of females and of seropositive subjects at baseline in the 1\u00d71011 vp when compared to the 5\u00d71010 vp. In addit ion, the sample size was limited. Of note, similar nAb GMTs were observed between both dose levels in study VAC31518COV2001. Although not taken into account for dose selection, it should be noted that a trend for higher binding antibody GMT with the higher vaccine dose was observed at Day 29 and Day 85 in the younger adults and at Day 87 in the older adults. S specific - CD4 Th1 cells , as defined by the Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 85/218 applicant, were detectable at Day 15 and proportions of positive samples and median responses remained st able up to Day 29. CD8 Th1 cells were also detected as early as Day 15 and their proportions and median responses further increased by Day 29. Specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses were overall in the same range for both dose levels, for both the proportion of positive samples and median responses. A low proportion of specific CD4 Th2 cells was detected in 1 subject only following vaccination. Th1/Th2 ratios were therefore 1 for all subjects. ELISpot results confirmed the results observed by the ICS metho d, an induction of Th1 cells responses in most of the vaccinated subjects, and overall comparable between groups. In conclusion, both dose levels, in both age groups, met the pre-specified criteria for dose selection, i.e. a lower limit of 95% confidence interval (CI) 65% and a Th1>Th2 within responder population. The lower limit of 95% confidence interval (CI) 65% was also observed in the 2 other studies for both dose levels. Taking all the above results into account, the applicant decided to continue th e clinical development with the 5x10 10 vp dose level. Since the pre- specified criteria were met for both dose levels after one single vaccine dose, the applicant selected the single regimen to be tested in the VAC31518COV3001 trial. The persistence of humoral immune responses is not known for more than 3 months. The second vaccine dose induced an increase in antibody titers, supporting the 2- dose schedule. Due to a study pause, immunogenicity evaluation of the added value of a second vaccine dose, with the adequate planned interval, will be missing for the older aged group. A 2- dose regimen is being evaluated in study VAC31518COV3009 as this may result in higher and more durable protective immune response. The immune responses induced by the selected dose l evel and schedule (5x1010 vp single dose) showed that: Both specific binding antibodies and neutralising antibodies (nAb) were detectable 14 days following vaccination (study VAC31518COV1001 and study VAC31518COV2001). Both responder rates and Ab GMTs furt her increased up to 28 days post -vaccination in the older adults, whereas in the younger adults, Ab GMTs increase from 28 days up to 56 days post -vaccination. Ab titers then plateau up to 84 days post -vaccination (study VAC31518COV1001). Responder rates were already high at 28 days post - vaccination, so no/slight further increase were noted thereafter. No longer term data are available. Neutralising Ab titers correlated highly with binding Ab titers, in both the young and older adults, at both Day 29 and Day 71 (young adults only). This was performed with qualified, non -validated assays, and should be confirmed on samples from the Phase 3 trial, including participants of various countries and with comorbidities ( see list of recommendations ). In trial VAC31518COV3001, binding antibodies were detected, and GMTs were overall comparable between sites and countries, i.e. Brazil, South Africa and the US. Although results should be interpreted with caution due to the limited sample size per site, these results sugges t that the population characteristics and environmental factors do not interfere with binding Ab responses induced by the vaccine. Functional antibodies, other than nAb, with a suggested role in viral clearance in vivo, were detected at 14 days post -vaccin ation and proportion and median of response increase up to Day 29 (no data available after Day 29), in both the younger and the older adults. High correlations were observed between the phagocytic score and nAb or binding Ab titers. Specific CD4 and CD8 Th 1 cells were also detected at 14 days following vaccination. The proportion of CD4 Th1 positive samples remains stable (young adults) or slightly increases (older adults) up to 28 days post -vaccination, whereas the proportion of CD8 Th1 positive samples fu rther increases up to 28 days post -vaccination. Medians of responses were apparently calculated taking into account all the samples, regardless of their positivity. Determination of medians of responses based on positive samples only would have given a better idea of the magnitude of the response in 'responder' subjects . The MAH is requested to Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 86/218 provide median of responses based on positive samples only and comparison between group in the final CSR (see list of recommendations ). Median CD4 Th2 responses were overall undetectable at Day 15 and Day 29 in all vaccine groups. CD8 Th2 cells were not assessed. In addition to the character isation by ICS, Th1 and Th2 phenotypes were character ised by IFN - and IL -4 ELISpot and results were consistent wi th those observed by the ICS method. Neutralising activity of immune sera from participants of study VAC31518COV1001 vaccinated with Ad26.COV2.S was tested against the emerging Kent variant , SARS- CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage. The capacity of the vaccine -induced nAb to neutralise the B.1.1.7 strain increased from Day 29 to Day 71. Further evolution over time is unknown. In addition, although a second vaccine - dose was demonstrated to boost the nAb response, the neutralising capacity for the Victoria 1/2020 strain remained higher compared to the B. 1.1.7 strain. This difference in neutral isation capacity is not unexpected since the mutation N501Y is in the receptor binding domain of the Spike protein. A difference in neutralising capacity was also observed for the ChAd Ox1 nCoV - 19 vaccine . These data are preliminary and should be interpreted with caution as the assays have not been validated for direct comparisons across variants. Furthermore, the correlation between VNA titers and vaccine efficacy has not been establish ed. The clinical relevance of the finding is unknown. Additional data on cross -neutral isation for clinically relevant and emerging SARS- CoV-2 strains by testing sera of human clinical participants, particularly of study VAC31518COV3001 in functional in vit ro assays, are expected ( see list of recommendations ). Immune responses induced by alternative dose levels were investigated in the Phase 2 VAC31518COV2001 trial, at dose level of 1.25x10 10 vp, 2.5x1010 vp, 5x1010 vp, and 1x1011 vp. At 2 weeks and one- month post -vaccination, responder rates were high and comparable between the dose levels of 2.5x1010 vp, 5x1010 vp, and 1x1011 vp. The responder rates were lower for the 1.25x1010 vp vaccine group when compared to the 3 other groups. nAb GMTs were overall comparable between the 2.5x1010 vp, 5x1010 vp and 1x1011 vp groups 2 weeks following vaccination, with only a modest increase with dose levels. At Day 29, GMTs were increased when compared to 14 days post - vaccination. Lower nAb GMTs were also observed in the 1.25x1010 vp group at both timepoint when compared to the 3 other groups. At 28 days post -vaccination, nAb titers were overall comparable between younger and older adults in study VAC31518COV1001. In contrast to results of Cohort 1a (young adults), a trend for lower Ab GMT value was observed at 86 days post -vaccination. As consequence, GMT value was lower t han the ones observed in the younger adults at 56- or 70 -days post-vaccination. These decrease in neutralising titers maybe due to the immunosenescence phenomenon. As no subject > 7 5 years of age were included in the wtVNA analysis, Ab neutralising capacit y is unknow for old subjects (> 75 years of age ) but could be even more impaired. A decrease in functionality of vaccine -induced Ab was also evidenced by the lower phagocytic score GMs and positivity rates observed 28 days post -vaccination in the older vs the younger adults. Binding Ab GMT values were lower in the older adults than those observed in the younger adults up to 3 months post- first vaccination, but differently than what it was observed for older adults in nAb titers, S-binding GMTs continued to increase until the last day that was registered. The proportion of positive samples in the older adults, for both CD4 and CD8 Th1 response, were lower than those observed in the younger adults. Median of the CD4 Th1 responses are comparable between both ag e groups, but median CD8 Th1 response was lower for the older when compared to the younger adults. However, these results cannot be interpreted since they are based on the total subjects and not on seropositive subjects . Based on preliminary results, vacci ne-induced immune responses appear to be lower in the older vs the younger adults. A decrease in functionality is observed, which is not unexpected since it is Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 87/218 recogn ised that older individuals might have impaired immune responses. The impact on the persis tence and on the protection is unknown. These observations support studying the role of a second dose as it is currently being done with the ongoing trial (VAC31518COV3009). Limited results showed that vaccine elicited immune responses in seropositive subj ects were similar or higher and with the same kinetics when compared to seronegative subjects. A trend for higher nAb and binding Ab responses in females compared to males was observed, in both study VAC31518COV1001 and study VAC31518COV2001. No data avail able comparing immunogenic induced by vaccination in subjects with or without comorbidities. Ad26 nAb were measured, at baseline and/or post -first vaccination, in studies VAC31518COV1001, VAC31518COV1002 and VAC31518COV3001. Detectable baseline levels of Ad26 nAb were observed in only few participants in studies VAC31518COV1001 and VAC31518COV1002. In study VAC31518COV3001, vaccinated participants from Brazil had an overall Ad26 seroprevalence of 32.5% whereas seroprevalence in the US participants was 2.0% in the vaccine group. Although the responder rate (as measured by S -ELISA at Day 29) was slightly higher for Brazilian participants with no detectable Ad26 nAb at baseline when compared to Brazilian participants with detectable Ad26 nAb at baseline, no strong correlation was observed between S binding Ab levels 28 days post -vaccination and pre -existing Ad26 nAb at baseline. This is consistent with the overall comparable GMT values observed 28 days post -vaccination between the US site and the Brazilian site s. Although Ad26 -nAb were detected in more than 95% of participants following vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S in study VAC31518COV1001, it did not suggest an apparent negative impact of anti - Ad26 vector immunity induced by the first vaccine dose on the post- dose 2 insert specific vaccine - elicited humoral immune responses. Correlation between Ad26 nAb pre- dose 2 and SARS -CoV-2 nAb post-dose 2 was poor. The impact on binding Ab and T cell responses was not presented. Overall, the potential impact of natural or v accine induced anti -Ad26 immunity on immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy remains unclear and should be further documented. Integrated results of the different trials included in the COVID -19 clinical development programme , and overall for Ad26 -based vaccin ation, if possible, are further expected ( see list of recommendations ). Results of studies VAC31518COV1001, VAC31518COV1002, and VAC31518COV2001 do not suggest an impact of the use of antipyretics/analgesics post -vaccination on the vaccine -induced nAb. Humoral vaccine -induced immune responses are available up to 85 days post -dose 1 for a limited number of young participants of study VAC31518COV1001. Ab responses were sustained up to 3 months post - vaccination. The persistence of the response for a longer per iod is unknown. In studies VAC31518COV1001, VAC31518COV1002 and VAC31518COV2001, participants are to be followed up to 1 year post last vaccination. Participants of the immunogenicity subset of study VAC31518COV3001 will be followed -up until 2 years. A lon ger follow -up for participants of Cohorts 1 and 3 of study VAC31518COV1001 would have allowed a direct comparison of the long- term immunogenicity for the 1- and 2 -dose schedules. Participants of Cohorts 2a and 2b of study VAC31518COV1001 will be followed f or a longer duration (36 and 38 months, respectively). The effect of a booster dose given at various timepoints will be evaluated in a 1 - or 2-dose regimen in Cohorts 2a and 2b. In the absence of ICP, the timing for a booster dose will be difficult to esta blish. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the immune response, at various timepoints, following a boost is important to evaluate. In addition, because of the circulation of different strains, it is not known if such booster, i.e. with the prototype vaccine, wi ll be needed in the future or if a new vaccine construct with a different or additional strain(s) would be needed. The expected data might nevertheless give an idea on the optimal/best timing for a boost, in term of immunogenicity, that could guide the choice for a boost timing, regardless of the strain(s) included in the vaccine. The assessment of the anamnestic response of Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 88/218 study VAC31518COV 2001 would also give information on the need for a boost. However, the interval between vaccination and the assessmen t of an anamnestic response is 4 or 6 months, which may be too short (see list of recommendations) . 2.4.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology Interim immunogenicity results are available from 4 ongoing trials. Results consistently demonstrated that a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S, at the selected dose level of 5x1010 vp elicits both humoral and cellular immune responses in adult 18 to 55 years and 65 years of age. However, vaccine -induced immune responses appear to be lower in the older vs the younger adults. Neutralising and binding Ab were sustained up to 3 months after vaccination, in adults 18 to 55 years. Persistence of Ab over a longer period is not known. It is not known if Ab will persist in a similar fashion in older adults. A 2.5 -3 fold increase in antibody titers is observed following a second vaccine dose given at 56 days interval. This supports the applicant's choice to evaluate a 2 -dose regimen in an efficacy trial. The impact of pre- existing immunity to Ad26 still remains to be further investiga ted. First results of the COVID -19 program do not indicate a major impact of presence of Ad26- nAb on the vaccine -induced humoral response. Preliminary data showed that n eutralising antibodies elicited by Ad26.COV2.S were able to neutral ise the B.1.1.7 lineage variant in vitro, although less efficiently than the reference strain. These data are however to be interpreted with caution as the assays have not been validated for direct comparison across variants. In the absence of immunological correlates of prot ection , the clinical relevance of these findings is unknown . 2.5. Clinical efficacy The applicant is performing two phase III studies. Both are multicentre , random ised, double blind, placebo -controlled studies, to determine pivotal efficacy and safety in adults aged 18 years and older. The efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S will be evaluated in these participants after one (VAC31518COV3001- ESEMBLE) or t wo intramuscular doses (VAC31518COV3009 - HORIZON). The study VAC31518COV3001 is being carried out in several centres in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, South Africa and US, and it will include up to 40,000 healthy adults aged 18 years and older. This study is the one presented by the applicant for this MAA. The study VAC31518COV3009 is being carried out in several centres in US, UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and South Africa and it will include up to 30.000 healthy adults aged 18 y ears. The applicant has not presented results from this study for the current MAA. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 89/218 2.5.1. Dose response study(ies) See section 2.4.3.

Utilisation of the frailty index as a measure of frailty prior to vaccination comparing the Ad26.COV2.S vs placebo group and as a measure to compare cases in the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine vs placebo group. Notes to the previous table: - Molecularly confirmed COVID -19 is defined as a positive SARS -CoV-2 viral RNA result by a central laboratory using a PCR -based or other molecular diagnostic test. - All efficacy analyses will occur in the per -protocol (PP) analysis set, in seronegative participants unless otherw ise indicated in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). Efficacy assessments and procedures: An active surveillance of COVID -19 signs and symptoms is in place for all participants. This surveillance (symptom check) is done through a digital tool referred to as 'electronic clinical outcome assessment' (eCOA). Participants are asked at least twice a week, through this eCOA, if they have experienced any new symptoms or health concerns that could be related to infection with SARS -CoV-2. Participant failing to com plete the surveillance question upon reminders were contacted by the site. The criteria for suspected COVID -19 (ie, the triggers to proceed with home -collection of the nasal swabs on COVID -19 Day 1- 2 and to proceed with the COVID -19 Day 3- 5 visit) were pr especified as follows: a positive RT -PCR result for SARS -CoV-2, through a private or public laboratory independent of the study, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic OR new onset or worsening of any 1 of the Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 96/218 symptoms from a pre-defined list of symptoms (symptoms from the CDC list and additional symptoms), which lasts for at least 24 hours, not otherwise explained. In the event a participant experiences COVID -19-like signs and symptoms meeting pre- specified criteria for suspected COVID -19, or a participant b ecame aware of a positive RT -PCR test result for SARS- CoV-2 outside the study site context, this triggered swabbing and other specific procedures. The site had to reach out to the participant at the latest on COVID -19 Day 2 to assess whether the reported s igns and symptoms qualified as a suspected COVID -19 episode using prespecified criteria. As several of the prespecified criteria for suspected COVID -19 overlap with vaccine -related reactogenicity, investigators' clinical judgement was used to exclude vacci ne-related events when assessing suspected COVID -19. Case Definitions Case Definition for Moderate COVID -19 A SARS -CoV-2 positive RT -PCR or molecular test result from any available respiratory tract sample (e.g. nasal swab sample, sputum sample, throat swab sample, saliva sample) or other sample AND at any time during the course of observation: Any 1 of the following new or worsening signs or symptoms: OR Any 2 of the following new or worsening signs or symptoms: Respiratory rate 20 breaths/minute Fever (38.0\u00b0C or 100.4\u00b0F) Abnormal saturation of oxygen (SpO2) but still >93% on room air at sea level* Heart rate 90 beats/minute Clinical or radiologic evidence of pneumonia Shaking chills or rigors Radiologic evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) Sore throat Shortness of breath or difficulty Malaise as evidenced by 1 or more of the following**: - Loss of appetite - Generally unwell - Fatigue - Physical weakness Headache Muscle pain (myalgia) Gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain)** New or changing olfactory or taste disorders Red or bruised looking feet or toes Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 97/218 * SpO2 criteria were adjusted according to altitude per the investigator judgement. ** Having 2 or more elements of a symptom (e .g., vomiting and diarrhoea or fatigue and loss of appetite) was counted only as 1 symptom for the case definition. To meet the case definition, a participant had to have at least 2 different symptoms. Case Definition for Severe/Critical COVID -19 - A SARS- CoV-2 positive RT -PCR or molecular test result from any available respiratory tract sample (e.g. nasal swab sample, sputum sample, throat swab sample, saliva sample) or other sample . AND any 1 of the following at any time during the course of observation: - Clinical signs at rest indicative of severe systemic illness (respiratory rate 30 breaths/minute, heart rate 125 beats/minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) 93% on room air at sea l evel*, or partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) <300 mmHg). * SpO2 criteria will be adjusted according to altitude per the investigator judgement. - Respiratory failure (defined as needing high -flow oxygen, non -invasive ventila tion, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]). - Evidence of shock (defined as blood pressure <90 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure <60 mmHg, requiring vasopressors). - Significant acute renal, hepatic, or neurologic dysfunction. - Admission to the ICU. - Death. Clinical Severity Adjudication Committee: All cases meeting the severe/critical criteria are adjudicated by the Clinical Severity Adjudication Committee (CSAC) to determine if the case is severe/critical in their judgement. All potential severe/critical COVID -19 cases defined as those cases that meet the severe/critical definition by scoring of signs and/or symptoms or meet the moderate endpoint definition with a total of 3 or more signs and/or symptoms were assessed independently by the CSAC. Classification of severity was based on the highest de gree of severity during the observation period. Classification of a case as severe/critical by the CSAC is considered definitive. The CSAC independently evaluates the severity of the COVID -19 cases in a blinded manner. Additional information was provided i n the Clinical Severity Adjudication Committee Charter. Case Definition for Mild COVID -19 - A SARS- CoV-2 positive RT -PCR or molecular test result from any available respiratory tract sample (e.g. nasal swab sample, sputum sample, throat swab sample, saliv a sample) or other sample; AND at any time during the course of observation: - One of the following symptoms: fever (38.0\u00b0C or 100.4\u00b0F), sore throat, malaise (loss of appetite, generally unwell, fatigue, physical weakness), headache, muscle pain (myalgia), gastrointestinal symptoms, cough, chest congestion, runny nose, wheezing, skin rash, eye irritation or discharge, chills, new or changing olfactory or taste disorders, red or bruised looking feet or toes, or shaking chills or rigors. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 98/218 A case is considered mild when it meets the above case definition but not the moderate to severe/critical definition. US FDA Harmonized Case Definition for COVID -19 If a participant presents with symptoms as those listed by the US FDA harmonized case definition (Cent er for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms of Coronavirus. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/symptoms- testing/symptoms.html., see picture below), the investigator (or designated medically trained clinician) should assess if these are suggestiv e of COVID -19: - A SARS- CoV-2 positive RT -PCR or molecular test result from any available respiratory tract sample (e.g. nasal swab sample, sputum sample, throat swab sample, saliva sample) or other sample; AND - COVID -19 symptoms consistent with those def ined by the US FDA harmonized case definition at the time of finalisation of this protocol: fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, diarrhoea . BOD endpoint To evaluate the effect of the vaccine against symptomatic molecularly confirmed COVID -19, including mild infections, a BOD endpoint was evaluated based on the first occurrence of molecularly confirmed COVID -19, including mild, moderate and severe/critical case definitions, with onset at least 14 days after vaccination (Day 15) and with onset at least 28 days after vaccination (Day 29). In this study, the BOD endpoint is defined as taking the value 1 for mild and moderate disease and the value 2 for severe disease (implicitly assigning a value of 0 for no disease [not infected or asymptomatic infection]). Case Definition for Asymptomatic or Undetected COVID -19 If a participant does not fulfil the criteria for suspected COVID -19 based on signs and symptoms. AND - has a SARS -CoV-2 positive RT -PCR or molecular test result from any available respiratory tract sample (e .g. nasal swab sample, sputum sample, throat swab sample, saliva sample) or other sample OR - develops a positive serology (non -S protein) test Then, the participant is considered to have experienced asymptomatic or undetected COVID -19. SARS- SARS -CoV-2 immunoglobulin assay) based on SARS -CoV-2 N protein will be performed to identify cases of asymptomatic infection on samples obtained at Day 1 (pre- vaccination), Day 29, Day 71, 6 months, and 1 year after vaccination. Virology assessments: Participants with suspected COVID -19 self -collected a nasal swab at home on the Day of symptom's onset or the following day (Day 1 -2). Another nasal swab was taken on Day 3 -5 by a health care professional during site visit. The nasal swabs could also be co llected at hospital or other location, if needed. Nasal swabs were then self -collected once every 2 days (by the participant at home). Saliva samples were collected by the participant on COVID -19 Day 3- 5 and then once every 2 days if Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 99/218 participants met the p rotocol prespecified criteria for suspected COVID -19 on COVID -19 Day 1- 2 and COVID -19 Day 3- 5 (as assessed during Part 1 of the COVID -19 Day 3- 5 visit). Nasal samples were collected with a foam tip mid -turbinate swab. The saliva samples were collected with the OMNIgeneOral RNA/DNA device. Virological confirmation of the endpoint cases and viral shedding assessment: Nasal swabs were used to detect and/or quantify SARS -CoV-2. Exploratory quantification of the SARS - CoV-2 viral load in saliva samples could also be performed. Nasal swabs were tested at the central laboratory. All nasal swabs were also tested by a local laboratory for case management, as central laboratory results are not be available in real time . In case a SARS -CoV-2 local RT -PCR test is not available, the RT -PCR on swab sample will be performed centrally. Sites have to use a molecular (PCR) diagnostic test from Tier -1 and Tier -2 list of assays, all with FDA EUA, as predefined by the COVID -19 vaccine taskforce (formerly operation warp speed). Con firmation testing was done by a central lab at Washington University, using the Tier -1 Abbott Realtime SARS -CoV-2 RT-PCR assay. The Abbott m2000 qualitative PCR received EUA and uses a dual target strategy to detect stretches in the RdRp and in the N genes . An unrelated RNA sequence is spiked as internal processing control. All sites in South Africa used BARC as local central lab for testing. Gene sequencing: Sequencing of all cases samples is ongoing, in order to detect which are the infectious strains, particularly in South Africa and Brazil because of the circulation of variants of concern during the study period. Nasal swab specimens from SARS -CoV-2 RT-PCR confirmed cases were used for sequence analysis. One sample per subject, taken as close as possible to the onset of symptoms, was selected when SARS- CoV-2 viral load was >200 copies/m L. Next-generation sequencing was performed using the Swift Biosciences SNAP Version 2.0, performed at the Virology Laboratory of the University of Washington. The SARS -CoV-2 Wuhan- Hu1 variant including the D614G mutation is taken as the reference sequence. Only S gene information was considered, and whole viral genome sequences have not yet been analysed . Efficacy evaluations Sample size The sample size has been triggered by the total number of cases TNE. The assumptions were VE of 60%, Null VE value of 30%, random isation ratio of 1:1, one -sided 2.5% alpha and 90% statistical power employing the sequential probability ratio test [SPRT] to perform a fully sequentia l design analysis. That lead to a target number of events (TNE) of 154. The applicant performed a relevant change in the third protocol amendment and the total sample size was decreased from 60,000 participants to 40,000. The applicant's rationale was based in that the COVID incidence was underestimated at the moment of the trial design, and that the attack rates were actually higher. Thus, statistical calculations supported the decision to randomise 40.000 patients to obtain a minimum TNE of 154. Randomisation Central random isation was implemented in this study. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 vaccination groups (active vaccine [Group 1] versus placebo [Group 2]). This was based on a computer -generated random isation schedule. The random isation was balanced by using randomly Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 100/218 permuted blocks and was stratified by vaccination unit, age group, and absence/presence of comorbidities that are or might be associated with an increased risk of progression to severe COVID - 19. The random isation system was used to control the age distribution of participants in the trial; in particular the age ranges of 18 to <40 and 40 to <60 years can be closed separately for further random isation in order to obtain a distribution of approximately 20% and 50% for these a ge ranges, respectively, and to have a minimum of approximately 30% of the population to be 60 years. Blinding (masking) Blinding will be guaranteed by the preparation of the study vaccine by an unblinded pharmacist or other qualified study -site personnel with primary responsibility for study vaccine preparation and dispensing, and by the administration of vaccine in a masked syringe by a blinded study vaccine administrator. Data that may potentially unblind the study vaccine assignment (i. e. immunogenici ty data, study vaccine accountability data, study vaccine allocation, biomarker, or other specific laboratory data) will be handled with special care to ensure that the integrity of the blind is maintained and the potential for bias is minim ised. This can include making special provisions, such as segregating the data in question from view by the investigators, clinical team, or others as appropriate until the time of database lock and unblinding. Investigators may receive requests to unblind study participants who become eligible to receive an author ised/licensed COVID -19 vaccine if/when these become available. In these cases, the investigator will discuss with the participant available options and ramifications. If the participant is eligible for an author ised/licensed vaccine according to local immun isation guidelines or recommendation and if the participant wishes to proceed with the unblinding, the investigator will follow the unblinding procedures as described in the protocol. Statistical methods Overal l statistical design This is a fully sequential trial in which the statistical boundaries were based on a truncated sequential probability ratio test (SPRT). Two co- primary endpoints were predefined based on the case definition with onset of at least 14 - and 28- days post -vaccination, in the per protocol population set at an overall 2.5% one- sided alpha level. The trial positiveness was predefined for a simultaneously superiority for the two- coprimary endpoints against the null value of 30% VE, with both point estimates >50% VE, and 5 cases in the placebo arm. Vaccine Efficacy = 100 x (1- ratio of incidence vaccine/placebo)% The statistical monitoring for efficacy started once: the following criteria were met for cases of onset at least 28 days after vaccination: (a) 6 cases for the 60years age, (b) 42 cases moderate to severe/critical, (c) 5 cases severe/critical, and assessed weekly AND pre-specified non -efficacy boundaries were met OR 154 cases with onset 28 days after vaccination Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 101/218 Also, the analysis might be triggered in case non -efficacy boundary was met OR the harm boundary was crossed. Multiplicity for secondary endpoints The evaluation of secondary endpoints was adjusted for multiple testing of multiple endpoints (using a graphical approach, Bretz et al 2009) and potential stopping at an interim analysis evaluation through a Pocock boundary using Wang -Tsiatis with Delta=0.5. Since no interim analysis was performed, the statistical hypothesis testing scheme started at the primary analysis. The associated alp ha levels and confirmatory endpoints are listed in the following Table. For all displays in the body of this report, an adjusted 95% CI is shown when a statistical hypothesis was evaluated to control the false positive rate. Otherwise data are summar ised descriptively, using a 95% CI. Populations for Analysis Sets For purposes of analysis, the following populations are defined: - Full Analysis Set (FAS): All random ised participants with a documented study vaccine administration, regardless of the occurrence of protocol deviations and serostatus at enrolment. Analyses of safety will be performed on the FAS. Vaccine efficacy analyses can be repeated using the FAS. - Per-protocol Efficacy (PP) population: Participants in the FAS who receive study vaccine and who are seronegative at the time of vaccination and who have no other major protocol deviations that were judged to possibly impact the efficacy of the vaccine. The PA of VE will be based on the PP population. The PP will be the main analysis population for efficacy analyses. The following variables are relevant for in/exclusion of analyses: - If a participant is seropositive at baseline, the participant is excluded from the PP set. In case the test result is missing or unknown the participant is considered as seronegative for analysis purposes. - PCR positive (PCR+) or negative (PCR -) at baseline: a sample for SARS -CoV-2 infection at baseline is collected for each parti cipant. For participants with a positive SARS -CoV-2 infection during the study this sample is tested. If a participant was analysed PCR+ at baseline, the participant is excluded from the PP set. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 102/218 Results Participant flow A total of 44,325 participants were random ised to the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine arm (n=22,174) or to the placebo arm (n=22,151) to the placebo arm. The proportion of subjects random ised and not vaccinated was very low and balanced between arms (1.3% vs 1.2% in the Ad26.COV2.S and placebo arms respectively). A total of 43,783 random ised participants received the study vaccine (21,895 and 21,888 in the Ad26.COV2.S vs placebo arms). This cohort constitutes the Full Analysis Set (FAS). Of the participants in the FAS, 19,630 (89.7%) and 19,691 (90.0%) were included in the Per Protocol Efficacy Set (PP), respectively in the Ad26.COV2.S vs placebo arms (total of 39,321). A total of 4462 participants were eliminated from the PP. Baseline seropositivity for SARS -CoV-2 was the main reason for elimination from the PP set (n=4217) and/or being PCR positive at the time of vaccination the second reason (n=238). Other reasons were major protocol deviations (evaluated to possibly impact efficacy, on inclusion/exclusion criteria, or received wrong tre atment, or received a disallowed concomitant medication). Reasons for elimination from the PP were balanced across groups. In the FAS, 54.6% of participants had a follow -up of at least 2 months after vaccination (calculated as 8 weeks) in both arms (in the PP, respectively 54.6% and 54.7% Ad26.COV2.S vs placebo arms), at the time of this primary analysis. The median follow -up time after vaccination was 58.0 days in both arms, in both the FAS and the PP. In the FAS, 1080 (4.9%) and 1177 (5.4%) participants were unblinded respectively in the vaccine and placebo arms, up to the cut -off date of 22 January 2021. The percentage of unblinding is balanced across arms. Unblinding were all due to request to be unblinded by participants who became eligible to receive an author ised/licensed COVID -19 vaccine (no unblinding for safety concern). Following emergency use author isation of COVID -19 vaccines in December, participants were offered the possibility to have access to the vaccines if they were part of the risk groups for which the vaccine was recommended (it was essentially in the US). Participants that were unblinded for this purpose remained under follow up in the study. Data collected up to unblinding are included in the analysis described in this report. Very few subjects terminated study participation prematurely at the time of data cut- off point for the primary analysis (in the FAS: 49 [0.2%] vs 96 [0.4%] and in the PP: 41 [0.2%] vs 89 [0.5%] in the Ad26.COV2.S vs placebo arms respectively). The main reason for termination was withdrawal by subject (in the FAS: 35 [0.2%] vs 66 [0.3%] and in the PP 30 [0.2%] vs 62 [0.3%] i n the Ad26.COV2.S vs placebo arms respectively). The proportion of premature termination was slightly higher in the placebo vs vaccination arm. Recruitment Date study initiated: 21 September 2020 (Date first participant signed informed consent) Date study completed: Not applicable, the study is ongoing. Date of data cutoff: 22 January 2021 (Date of last observation recorded as part of the database for primary analysis). Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 103/218 Conduct of the study There were 3 amendments to the protocol. The first amendment (15 September 2020) was adopted before any study -related procedures had begun and mainly implemented the selected dose level of 5\u00d71010 vp for Ad26.COV2.S based on data from the FIH study VAC31518COV1001. The second amendment (29 October 2020) included the follow ing changes: clarification that all participants that have an RT -PCR positive finding for SARS -CoV-2, even if asymptomatic, will be followed until there are 2 consecutive negative PCRs, correction of errors and minor editorial changes. The third amendment (14 December 2020) included the main following changes: The occurrence of molecularly confirmed, moderate to severe/critical COVID -19, with onset at least 28 days postvaccination was added as a co - primary endpoint in addition to the current primary endpoin t counting as of 14 days post -vaccination. The applicable secondary and exploratory endpoints were updated similarly to also include COVID -19 cases with onset at least 28 days post -vaccination. In addition, the total sample size was reduced from 60,000 to approximately 40,000 participants. The protocol is further amended to change the conditions for monitoring whether efficacy greater than 30% is achieved using the sequential monitoring algorithm. Furthermore, additional secondary and exploratory objectives and endpoints were added. Baseline data Demographic and Baseline Characteristics FAS: The main region was Northern America (United States: 44.1% of subjects in both groups), followed by Latin America (Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Mexico: 40. 9% of subjects in both groups). There was a substantial representation of Southern Africa (15.0% in both groups). Latin American subjects mainly originated from Brazil (16.6%) Colombia (9.7%) and Argentina (6.8%). Approximately a fifth of the participants were frontline essential workers (6.9% vs. 7.0%) or health care professionals (13.0% vs. 12.8%). There were only few long- term care residents: 0.3% (n=63) vs. 0.4% (n=85) in respective groups. A total of 9.6% of the participants were SARS -CoV-2 seropositi ve at baseline (9.8% vs 9.4% in respective arms). These participants were excluded from the PP set. Data on serostatus was missing in 637 vaccinees vs 625 placebo subjects. SARS -CoV-2 seroprevalence was highest in South Africa region (23.8% vs. 22.9%), fol lowed by Latin America and Northern America (4.4% vs. 4.3%). Seroprevalence varied across countries from Latin America (for the most represented countries: 11.4%). In the FAS, mean age was 50.7 years (median 52.0 years) in both groups, with a range of 18;100 years and 18;94 years respectively in the Ad26.COV2.S group vs the placebo group. Of the FAS participants, 33.5% were 60 years in both groups (23.9% vs. 24.5% were 60-69 years, 8.6% vs. 8.1% were 70- 79 years, 1.0% vs. 1.0% were 80 years in the Ad26.COV2.S group vs the placebo group). The proportion of participants 65 years was 19.5% (n=4259) and 19.7% (n=4302), and the proportion of participants 75 years was 3.7% (n=809) and 3.3% (n=732), respectively in the Ad26.COV2.S group vs the placebo group. The proportion of females was 44.9% vs 45.2% in the vaccine vs the placebo arm. Overweight (BMI 25 - <30 kg/m2) and obese (BMI 30 kg/m2) individuals were well represented in the trial, with 37.6% vs 38.6% of the participants being overweight, and 28.6% vs. 28.4% being obese in respective arms. At least one comorbidity was present at baseline for 40.8% of the participants in both groups (29.0% vs. 28.6% had one comorbidity, 8.7% vs. 8.9% EMA/158424/2021 Page 104/218 comorbidities, and 3.1% vs. 3.3% had 3 or more comorbidities). Obesity (28.7% vs. 28.4%) was the most represented comorbidity, followed by hypertension (10.2% vs. 10.5%) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (7.3% vs. 7.3%). Other comorbidities present in more than 1% of the subjects were: asthma, COPD, and serious heart conditions. Of the FAS, 2.7% vs 2.8% of the participants were HIV infected, in the v accine vs the placebo arm. The HIV infection status is unknown for 59.2% in both arms. In the FAS, 0.2% of the subjects in both groups present an immunodeficiency condition (43 vs. 36 participants in respective groups), <0.1% present secondary immunodefici ency (7 vs. 3), 0.5% present malignant neoplasm (112 vs. 114), and 0.5% present chronic kidney disease (112 vs. 118) (Source: TSIMH01). PP: Participants who were SARS -CoV-2 seropositive at baseline were excluded from the PP set. The main region was Norther n America (United States: 46.8% and 46.6% in respective groups), followed by Latin America (Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Mexico: 40.6% and 40.7% of subjects in respective groups). There was a substantial representation of Southern Africa (12.6 % and 12.7% in respective groups). Latin American subjects mainly originated from Brazil (17.3%) Colombia 2125 (9.5%) and Argentina (7.2%). Data on the profession of participants and the number of long -term care residents was not provided for the PP. In the PP, mean age was 51.1 and 51.2 years in respective groups (median 52.0 years and 53.0 years respectively), with a range of 18;100 years and 18;94 years respectively in the Ad26.COV2.S group vs the placebo group. Of the PP participants, 34.6% were 60 y ears in both groups (24.6% vs. 25.1% were 60- 69 years, 9.0% vs. 8.4% were 70- 79 years, and 1.0% vs 1.0% were 80 years, in the Ad26.COV2.S group vs the placebo group). The proportion of participants 65 years was 20.3% (n=3984) and 20.4% (n=4018), and the proportion of participants 75 years was 3.8% (n=755) and 3.5% (n=693), respectively in the Ad26.COV2.S group vs the placebo group. The proportion of females was 44.3% vs 44.6% in the vaccine vs the placebo arm. Overweight (BMI 25 - <30 kg/m2) and obese ( BMI 30 kg/m2) individuals were well represented in the trial, with 38.1% vs 39.1% of the participants being overweight, and 27.6% vs. 27.5% being obese in respective arms. At least one comorbidity was present at baseline for 39.9% vs. 40.0% of the partici pants in respective groups (28.2% vs. 28.0% had one comorbidity, 8.5% vs. 8.8% had two comorbidities, and 3.1% vs. had 3 or more comorbidities). Obesity (27.6% vs. 27.5%) was the most represented comorbidity, followed by hypertension (10.2% vs. 10.3%) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (7.2% vs. 7.2%). Other comorbidities present in more of the subjects were: asthma (1.3%), COPD (1.0%), and serious heart conditions (2.4%). Of the FAS, 2.4% vs 2.5% of the participants were HIV infected, in the vaccine vs the placebo arm. PP within regions: Age distribution was roughly similar between South African and Latin America regions, but mean/median age and the proportion of elderly subjects were higher in the US. The proportion of subjects 65 years is not pres ented for the PP. The most frequent comorbidities were the same across regions, although frequencies were slightly different. HIV infection was more frequent in South Africa. Concomitant therapies Antipyretics were recommended post -vaccination for symptom relief as needed. Prophylactic antipyretic use was not encouraged. Analgesics/antipyretics were used by 1,128 (5.2%) participants in Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 105/218 the Ad26.COV2.S group and 365 (1.7%) participants in the placebo group up to 7 days post - vaccination. The most frequently u sed analgesics/antipyretics were paracetamol, metamizole sodium, and ibuprofen with a frequency that was higher in participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group, compared to participants in the placebo group. Concomitant medications of special interest (i. e. analg esics/antipyretics and corticosteroids) were used by less than 6% of participants in both groups. Numbers analysed Refer to subject's participant flow. Extent of exposure The study was staggered. Figure 10: Schematic overview of the enrolment across the study stages. Assessmen t report EMA/158424/2021 Page 106/218 Figure 11: Kaplan -Meier Curves of Time on Study by Age and Comorbidities; Per Protocol Analysis Set (VAC31518COV3001) Outcomes and estimation Co-primary and key Secondary Vaccin e Efficacy Results. The summaries of VE against molecularly confirmed COVID -19 with onset 14 days and 28 days, and 1 day after vaccination are presented in the below tables. Cases with an onset at least Day 14: For the primary endpoint 'moderate to severe/critical COVID -19' with an onset beyond Day 14, there were 116 vs 348 cases in the vaccine vs the placebo group, corresponding to a 66.9% efficacy (Adjusted 95% CI: 59.03; 73.40). The lower limit (LL) of the CI of 59% was well above the pre-specifie d limit of 30%. Therefore the primary objective was met for this endpoint. It is noted that of the 116 vs. 348 cases with an onset beyond Day 14, 66 vs. 193 cases occurred beyond Day 28 (hence nearly half occurred in the period 15- 28 days, i.e. 50 vs. 155) . 'Symptomatic COVID -19' cases (of any severity) were classified as either mild, or moderate or severe/critical (per protocol definitions). There were respectively 117 and 351 cases of symptomatic COVID -19 cases, of which 1 and 3 were mild and 116 vs. 348 met the primary endpoint case definition (i.e. were classified as moderate or severe/critical). As the vast majority of symptomatic COVID -19 cases were captured by the primary endpoint definition, the level of efficacy against 'symptomatic COVID -19' of any severity was the same (66.9% [95% CI: 59.07; 73.37]) as efficacy against the primary endpoint. The level efficacy against COVID -19 of any severity was consistent by using the US FDA Harmonized COVID -19 cases definition (67.2% [95% CI: 59.32; 73.67], based on 114 vs. 345 cases). Again, this shows that vast majority of symptomatic COVID -19 illness cases were captured by the primary endpoint definition. Cases with an onset at least Day 28: For the primary endpoint 'moderate to severe/critical COVID -19' with an onset beyond Day 28, there were 66 vs 193 cases in the vaccine vs the placebo group, correspo nding to a 66.1% efficacy (Adjusted 95% CI: 55.01; 74.80). The lower limit (LL) of the CI of 55% was well above the pre- specified limit of 30%. Therefore, the primary objective was met for this endpoint. There were respectively 66 and 195 cases of 'symptom atic COVID -19', of which 0 and 2 were mild and 66 vs. 193 met the primary endpoint case definition (i.e. were classified as moderate or severe/critical). As the vast majority of symptomatic COVID -19 cases were captured by the primary endpoint definition, t he level of efficacy against 'symptomatic COVID -19' of any severity was the nearly the same (66.5% [95% CI: 55.50; 75.05]) as efficacy against the primary endpoint. The level efficacy against COVID -19 of any severity was consistent by using the US FDA Harm onized COVID -19 cases definition (66.7% [95% CI: 55.63; 75.23]). The number of cases was 65 vs. 193. In the 4,156 participants with baseline SARS -CoV-2 seropositivity including non -centrally confirmed cases, 7 COVID -19 cases were reported PCR positive from any source, of which one was confirmed by the central laboratory.

NE: Not Evaluable Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 109/218 Vaccine Efficacy in Participants who were SARS -CoV-2 seropositive at baseline: Of 4,156 participants with baseline SARS -CoV-2 seropositivity, 7 COVID -19 cases with onset at least 14 days after vaccination were reported PCR positive from any source, of which one was confirmed by the central laboratory. Onset of Protection Against Molecu larly Confirmed Moderate to Severe/Critical COVID -19: The cumulative incidence of molecularly confirmed moderate to severe/critical COVID -19 cases, with onset at least 1 day after vaccination is presented in Figure 13 . The cumulative incidences with onset at least 14 days and 28 days after vaccination were also provided. Vaccine efficacy against molecularly confirmed moderate to severe/critical COVID -19 cases over time is presented in Figure 14 . The cumulative incidence of molecularly confirmed moderate to severe/critical COVID -19 cases shows that the curves for the placebo and vaccinated groups start to separate at Day 14, suggesting that the onset of protection is at that time. The applicant also presented a plot modelling the difference between the curves. This plot suggests that prot ection is starting to establish around Day 14 up to Day 28 -35, presumably related to maturation of functional immune responses and then stabil ises up to Day 56. The figure includes CI, which show that the uncertainty around the point estimate are too high (due to small numbers) for adequate interpretation after 56 days.

Results are presented in in the below tables. Cases that could not be adjudicated (such as severe cases that occurred after the cutoff date for adjudication, i.e. 19 January 2021) are included in the primary analysis but not included as severe/critical cases. Severe cases with an onset at least Day 14: Of the 116 vs. 348 moderate to severe/critical COVID -19 primary endpoint cases with an onset at least 14 days after vaccination, 14 (12%) vs. 60 (17%) were classified as severe/critical (further referred to as severe). Severe disease was a prespecified inf erential endpoint. The point estimate of VE disease was 76.7% (Adjusted 95% CI: 54.56; 89.09). The lower limit of the 95% CI of 55% was well above 30% (the prespecified LL was only 0%). Severe cases with an onset at least Day 28: Of the 66 vs. 193 moderate to severe/critical COVID -19 primary endpoint cases with an onset at least 28 days after vaccination, 5 (8%) vs. 34 (18%) were classified as severe/critical (further referred to as severe disease). VE against severe disease was estimated at 85.4% (Adjusted 95% CI: 54.15; 96.90). The lower limit of the CI 95% of 54% was well above 30% (the prespecified LL was only 0%). Algorithmic Interpretation of the Severe/Critical Case Definition: Cases were classified as 'severe/critical' based on clinical assessment by the clinical severity adjudication committee. This classification was used in the analyses. Cases were also classified as 'severe/critical' based on a programmed, algorithmic interpretation of the protocol definition (using vital signs, MA -COV, and SAE forms without clinical assessment). Less cases were classified as severe by the adjudication committee compared to the algorithmic definition (in the FAS, 42 vs. 65 for cases Day 14, 35 vs. 61 for cases Day 15 to Day 28, 39 vs. 55 for >Day 28).

Day >28 Moderate 205 189 92 82 Severe/Critical 39 55 19 22 Severity for 'cases adjudicated' is based on clinical assessment by the clinical severity adjudication committee outlined per the protocol and SAP. Severity for 'cases programming based' is based on the programmed, algorithmic interpretation of the protocol definition following the algorithm outlined in the SAP. A sensitivity analysis was performed, using the 'algorithmic interpretation' (for severe case with onset at least 14 days and at least 28 days), and generated overall consistent results compared to the 'adjudication definition'. With the algorithmic definition, efficacy point estimates were also slightly higher for severe compared to moderate disease, but the discrepancy between estimates is lower. Onset of protection against molecularly confirmed severe/critical COVID -19: The cumulative incidence curves for severe COVID -19 start to separate at Day 7, suggesting that protection may be established earlier for the severe cases. The plot modelling is still to be interpreted with caution and i t is thus difficult to conclude if protection is evolving differently over time for severe compared to moderate cases. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 112/218 Figure 14: Cumulative Incidence of Molecularly Confirmed Severe/Critical COVID -19 with Onset at Least 1 Day After Vaccination; Full Analysis Set (Study VAC31518COV3001) - Vaccine efficacy against asymptomatic or undetected SARS -CoV-2 infect ion: The applicant provided an additional interim analysis of the asymptomatic cases based on Day 71 serology results (CSR Addendum) with updated data for participants who had completed their Day 71 visit up to and including 22 January 2021 (serology resul ts cutoff 8 February 2021). Since the supplemental analyses are based on a larger number of N serology results, they supersede the results presented in the interim CSR (see above). At the time of the primary analysis, 965 participants had their Day 71 samples available, which is only about 2% of the FAS seronegative (n=39,548). This update is based on 2,892 participants with Day 71 serology results, which is 6% of the FAS seronegative and 19% of the number of samples required for the confirmatory analysis o f the 'asymptomatic or undetected' endpoint (which will only be performed when 15,000 participants have reached the Day 71 visit). Per protocol, an 'asymptomatic or undetected SARS -CoV-2 infection' case is ascertained based on seroconversion for N- antibodies or based on positive PCR results, in a participant who did not fulfill the criteria for suspected COVID -19 based on signs and symptoms. The algorithm in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) identified asymptomatic participants as those who had no symptoms on the day preceding, the day of, or any time after a positive RT -PCR test. A sensitivity analysis was done removing from the case definition the participants who presented symptoms at any time since screening. Asymptomatic SARS -CoV-2 Infection cases with an onset Day 1 - Day 29: Respectively 159 and 182 cases were classified as asymptomatic/undetected SARS -CoV-2 infections over the period Day 1 - Day 29, in the vaccine vs. placebo group (FAS seronegative population). This leads to an e fficacy point estimate of 12.5% (inconclusive). Respectively 153 and 175 cases who Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 113/218 seroconverted for SARS -COV-2 were detected on that period (serology risk set of participants with a non-S protein result available on Day 29), for an efficacy of 13.1% (inco nclusive). Asymptomatic SARS -CoV-2 Infection cases with an onset beyond Day 28: There are 22 vs. 54 undetected/asymptomatic cases in the vaccine vs. the placebo group (per protocol risk set), resulting in an efficacy of 59.7% (95% CI: 32.75; 76.64), f or the period >29 Days . From the 22 vs. 54 'asymptomatic or undetected SARS -CoV-2 infections' (respectively in the Ad26.COV2.S vs. placebo groups) that occurred beyond Day 29 after vaccination, most (18 vs. 50) were seroconverters (with either no PCR test available, or with a negative PCR [only 4 subjects]). The remaining subjects (4 vs. 4) had a positive PCR result. It is not stated whether these 8 subjects seroconverted as well, and it is not stated whether the result was confirmed at central lab. So, respect ively 18 vs. 50 participants seroconverted to COVID -19 (serology risk set of participants with a non -S protein result available on Day 71), for an efficacy of 65.5% (39.91; 81.08). Sensitivity analysis: Participants who had no symptoms were identified in the database using an algorithm. However, based on a manual review, it was found that some PCR positive cases classified as asymptomatic/undetected by the algorithm had symptoms 2 days or more prior to the PCR test. The applicant therefore performed a sens itivity analysis restricted to the participants without any COVID -19 symptoms since screening. Results from this analysis are in general line with the former.

Ancillary analyses Supplementary Analyses Including Centrally and Non -centrally Confirmed Cases Due to the delay needed to obtain the results from the central lab (average of 14 days), many cases with at least 1 positive PCR result from a local source were not confirmed yet at the time of the primary analysis. There was a longer confirmation time in some countries in the Latin America region and South Africa. Overall, 1,197 cases with at least 1 positive PCR result from any source were reported. Of these, 714 (59.6%) had a positive result from the central lab (positive at UoW), 77 (6.4%) had a positive local result but was not confirmed by the central lab (negative at UoW), for the other cases there is no result yet available at the central lab. The percentage of cases with PCR positive sam ples but non -confirmed at central lab was quite similar across countries (<10% in all countries), and for the subset of moderate and severe cases. There were no relevant differences across groups (overall and by severity level). When reported to the 791 ca ses who had at least 1 positive PCR result from any source and a result available from the central lab, 10% of the cases are not confirmed at the central lab.

Overall, results are in line with confirmed cases. - Vaccine Efficacy Against Molecularly Confirmed COVID -19 Requiring Medical Intervention: Molecularly Confirmed COVID -19 cases Requiring Medical Intervention Collected by the MRU Form: The MRU form is expected to be completed by the investigator on Day 3- 5 and/or Day 29 of the COVID -19 episode. At the time of the primary analysis (cut -off 22 January 2021), not all M RU forms were available, and therefore cases occurring with an onset of approximately 29 days (or less) prior to the cut -off for database lock may not have been included in this analysis per the SAP. Efficacy against molecularly confirmed COVID -19 events r equiring medical intervention at least 14 days after vaccination, was estimated at 75.0% (95% CI: - 25.28; 97.41). As there were less than 23 COVID -19 cases requiring medical intervention, no inferential testing was performed. This was based on respectively 2 (both severe) vs. 8 (6 severe and 2 moderate) cases in the active vs. the placebo group. At least 28 days after vaccination, 0 case of molecularly confirmed COVID -19 requiring medical intervention were observed in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 5 cases (3 severe and 2 moderate) were observed in the placebo group respectively (as less than 6 cases are observed, the VE and IC were however not shown). Beyond 14 days and 28 days after vaccination, there were thus 2 vs. 8 and 0 vs. 5 cases of molecularly confirmed COVID -19 requiring medical intervention, respectively in the Ad26.COV2.S vs. placebo group. The 2 participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group were hospital ised with no ICU admission. The 8 participants in the placebo group were hospital ised, including 1 admitte d at the ICU.

Additional post- hoc analysis of all COVID -19 related hospital isation s: The applicant later presented an additional post -hoc analysis of all COVID -19 related hospital isation s (database cutoff of the primary analysis, 22 January 2021), using a specific algorithm (i.e. implementing a broader search not using only MRU data, but base d on all available information from any source, such as SAE forms). In total, 6 vs. 42 COVID -19 related hospital isation s with an onset at least 1 day were observed (2 vs. 29 as of 14 days after vaccination, 0 vs. 16 as of 28 days after vaccination, in the Ad26.COV2.S group). In the per -protocol analysis set, as of 14 days after vaccination, based on 2 versus 29 events, efficacy against COVID -19 related hospital isation s was 93.1% (95% CI: 72.74; 99.20). When restricting the analysis to cases confirmed by the central lab, efficacy was 81.8% (95% CI: 16.69; 98.04), based on 2 vs. 11 events.

For subgroups with fewer than 6 cases, no VE was calculated. Vaccine efficacy results across demographic and baseline characteristics are summar ised in the below tables: Vaccine efficacy against molecularly confirmed moderate to severe/critical COVID -19 by age: - With onset at least 14 Days after vaccination The efficacy against molecularly confirmed 'moderate to severe/critical COVID -19' at least 14 days after vaccination was established, with slightly higher point estimates in the 60 years participants (76.3% [95% CI: 61.58; 86.04]) [95% CI: 53.87; 71.58]). Efficacy against cases occurring at least day 14 did not decrease with age. In contrast, there was a slight trend for efficacy to increase with age. The point estimates were 62.1%, 65.2%, 70.4%, 92.0%, in participants 18 -39 years, 40- 59 years, 60- 69 years, and 70- 79 years (there were no endpoint cases 80 years). It is noted that 60 years may not be a clinically relevant cutoff, and EMA defines the geriatric population as people aged 65 years and older (CPMP/ICH/379/95). In addition, middle and oldest old adults are not well represented in this trial's population (of the 60 years participants, 69% are 65 years participants but only 11% are 75 years). (EMA/CHMP/QWP/292439/2017). Efficacy was 82.4% (95% CI: 63.90; 92.38) in participants 65 years. - With onset a t least 28 Days after vaccination: The efficacy in terms of primary endpoint at least 28 days after vaccination was similar in the 18 -59 years participants (66.1% [95% CI: 79.6%, in participants 18 -39 years, 40-59 years, 60- 69 years, and 70- 79 years (there were no endpoint cases 80 years). Efficacy was 74.0% (95% CI: 34.40; 91.35) in participants 65 years. Vaccine against mo derate to severe/critical COVID -19 including non- confirmed cases, by age: - With onset at least 14 Days after vaccination: Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 121/218 In the extended dataset, the efficacy against 'moderate to severe/critical COVID -19' at least 14 days after vaccination were in line in the 18 -59 years participants (65.0% [95% CI: 85.1%, in participants 18 -39 years, 40- 59 years, 60- 69 years, and 70- 79 years (there were no endpoint cases 80 years). Efficacy was 76.5% (59.12; 87.30) in participants 65 years. - With onset at least 28 Days after vaccination: The efficacy in terms of primary endpoint at least 28 days after vaccination was similar in the 18 -59 years participants 66.8% (95% CI: in participants 18 -39 years, 40-59 years, 60- 69 years, and 70- 79 years (there were no endpoint cases 80 years). Efficacy was 68.6% (95% CI: 38.60; 85.06) in participants 65 years. Vaccine efficacy against molecularly confirmed moderate to severe/critical COVID -19 by comorbidities: Efficacy against molecularly confirmed moderate to severe/critical COVID -19 was also demonstrated in participants with and without comorbidities (point estimates 62.9% and 69.1% for cases with onset at least 14 Days afte r vaccination, and 48.6% and 72.6% for cases with onset at least 28 days after vaccination, for participants with and without comorbidities respectively). Efficacy was estimated for the most common comorbidities (obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mell itus, serious heart conditions), and consistent point estimates were shown. Consistent VE were observed when assessed including non -centrally confirmed cases. Efficacy cannot be assessed in participants with 3 comorbidities due to the limited number of c ases, and nothing can be concluded on a potential trend according to the number of comorbidities. The VE point estimates for those with comorbidities were slightly lower for the participants 'with' vs. 'without' comorbidities. When stratifying by age (18 -59 years vs. 60+ and 18- 64 years vs. 65 +), there was systematically a lower estimate of VE for those with vs. without comorbidities. Within the <60 years strata and the <65 years, efficacy was demonstrated for the participants with comorbidities, although the point estimate was slightly lower for the participants with comorbidities. However, within the 60 years strata and the 65 years strata, a larger difference in point estimates was observed between participants with and without comorbidities. Efficacy was in addition not significant (lower limit of the 95% CI<0) for the older participants with comorbidities when considering the events with onset >28 days (while it was for the events with onset at least 14 days). For efficacy against cases with onset at least 28 days efficacy was 33.2% (95% CI: - 77.59; ( -85.99; 85.26) for participants 65 years. The 95% CI are however very wide, and estimates are based on few events especially >28 days. The same pattern was found in the extended data set, although differences were less marked in the extended data set Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 122/218 Summary of Vaccine Efficacy of First Occurren ce of Molecularly -Confirmed Moderate to Severe/Critical COVID -19 by Subgroups; Per Protocol Set Onset at Least 14 Days Onset at Least 28 Days Subgroup Ad26.COV2.S Cases (Person - years) Placebo Cases (Person - years) VE% (95% CI) Ad26.COV2.S Cases (Person - years) Placebo Cases (Person - years) VE% (95% CI) Sex Male 59 report EMA/158424/2021 Page 123/218 Summary of Vaccine Efficacy of First Occurrence of Moderate to Severe/Critical COVID -19 Including Non-Confirmed Cases by Subgroups; Per Protocol Set Onset at Least 14 Days Onset at Least 28 Days Subgroup Ad26.COV2.S Cases (Person - years) Placebo Cases (Person - years) VE% (95% CI) Ad26.COV2.S Cases (Person - years) Placebo Cases (Person - years) VE% (95% CI) Sex FU duration by age and comorbidities: Length of follow up was the shortest for participants in the older age group (60 years of age), especially for participants with comorbidities. Approximately 50% of the participants 18 -59 years without comorbidities were followed for at least 65 days, while for the participants 18- 59 years with comorbidities it was 56 days. The length of follow up for participants 60 years of age with comorbidities was also shorter than for participants without comorbidities. -Approximately 50% of the participants 60 years without comorbidities were followed for at least 56 days, and 25% were followed for at least 72 days after vaccination. -Approximately 50% of the participants 60 years with comorbidities were followed for at least 50 days, and 25% were followed for at least 56 days after vaccination, and none were followed at least 72 days after vaccination. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 124/218 Overall, presence of comorbidi ty and older age were independently associated with shorter follow up duration. This reflects the staggered study design (participants with comorbidities were enrolled later in the trial). Vaccine efficacy by countries: A summary of vaccine efficacy agai nst confirmed COVID -19 cases with onset at least 14 days and 28 days after vaccination by country and severity, is presented below. Efficacy against molecularly confirmed moderate to severe/critical COVID -19 was demonstrated in each participating country. Except South Africa, all point estimates were >65% for cases with onset at least 14 days after vaccination (not computed in Chile and Mexico due to small numbers). In South Africa, efficacy was of lower magnitude compared to other region/countries CI: 65.45; 84.63] in the US, for cases with onset at least 14 days). When evaluated at least 28 days after vaccination, discrepancies between South Africa and the other regions was less marked CI: 53.12; 84.22] in the US). Moreover, heterogeneity across regions is much less marked when considering the extend ed data set (for cases with onset at least 14 days: 52.0% [95% CI: [95% CI: 65.00; 81.57] in the US). For cases with onset at least 28 days after v accination, differences across countries are small (64.0% CI: 58.19; 81.71] in the US). Kaplan Meier curves show that onset of protection occurs later in South Africa (around 28 days while overall the onset of protection occurs a 14 days), which may contribute to the lower observed efficacy. It might be hypothes ised that Ab and/or T cell responses of higher magnitude are needed for protection against the SA variant. When taking account both confirmed and non- confirmed cases, the vaccine efficacy against severe disease was high on all three regions (US, Brazil and South Africa).

If less than 6 cases are observed for an endpoint then the VE will not be shown. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 128/218 Viral genome sequencing of SARS -CoV-2 Spike protein variants In the time period during which study VAC31518COV3001was conducted, new SARS -CoV-2 lineages emerged in geographical regions where participants for the study were being enrolled. In order to conclude on a potential impact of the infecting SARS -CoV-2 strain on VE, whole genome sequencing of SRAS- CoV-2 in molecularly confirmed COVID -19 cases in the study was performed. Sample prioritisation were country (focusing on South Africa and Brazil), timing of the symptom onset (focusing on cases with an onset of symptoms after Day 14 or Day 28 post -vaccin ation), and severity of illness (focusing on cases with at least moderate or severe illness). Future selections will be made to ensure that as many cases as possible are sequenced New SARS- CoV-2 virus lineages are rapidly developing which include mutations in the virus S protein in areas such as the receptor binding domain (RBD) and the N- terminal domain (NTD), that are known targets of neutralising antibodies. Concerns have grown whether vaccines currently in use or in late development that are designed ba sed on the Wuhan -Hu1 variant (as the Ad26.COV2.S) will be able to protect against some of these new virus lineages. Of main concern are the spreading lineages originating from South Africa (lineage B.1.351, variant 20H/501Y.V2, see figure below), the UK (lineage B1.1.7, variant 20I/501Y.V1) and Brazil (lineage P.1, variant 20J/501Y.V3) due to mutations in the RBD and NTD that have shown to impact neutralisation . At the time of writing this updated report, S gene sequences were completed for 512 of 714 (71.7%) molecularly confirmed cases. Cases were selected for sequencing based on a viral load of >200 copies/mL, sufficient sample volume, sequencing priorit isation of samples from specific countries and severity of illness. The majority of molecularly confirme d infections in both the vaccine and placebo group are moderate/severe diseases. The interim analysis confirms the predominant circulation of 20H/501Y.V2 in South Africa (86/91 sequences found, 31 vs 55 in the vaccine and placebo groups respectively), the D614G -carrying \"WT/ref\" strain in the US (190/197 sequences found, 48 vs 142 in the vaccine and placebo groups respectively), and the P.2 (D614G + E484K) lineage in Brazil (86/124 sequences found, 27 vs 59 in the vaccine and placebo groups respectively). T he remaining 38/124 sequences found are the Wuhan - Hu1 reference sequence+D614G (10 vs 28 in the vaccine and placebo groups respectively). The 20I/501Y.V1 (UK variant) and the 20J/501Y.V3 (Brazilian P.1 variant) were not found in the analysed samples. Seque nce data was not yet available for all cases and a higher number of samples were sequenced in the placebo group when compared to the vaccine group, which could lead to biases. Therefore, an analysis of vaccine efficacy per SARS -CoV-2 variant is planned upo n completion of sequencing. Vaccine efficacy against severe/Critical COVID -19 by subgroups: Efficacy against severe disease by age and by comorbidities. For cases with onset >14 days, efficacy was also demonstrated against molecularly confirmed severe/critical COVID -19 in the 18- 59 years, and 60 years, as well as in participants with and without comorbidities. Efficacy was 80.5% (95% CI: 57.82; 92.10) 68.5% (95% CI: 18.07; 89.72) in participants 60 years of age. For cases with onset >28 days, for participants 60 years of age, and for participants with comorbidities, the lower bound of the 95% CI was <0% (low number of cases). Point estimates were slightly lower for the older vs. younger adults (with the 60 years cut- off or the 65 years cut of), and for those with vs. without comorbidities. Differences were smaller in the extended dataset. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 129/218 In conclusion, efficacy against severe COVID -19 was observed in the participants <60 years, as in those 60 years, with no indication of a marked decrease in efficacy over age. Efficacy was also observed in participants with comorbidities. This was a descriptive analysis (non -infere ntial). Efficacy against severe disease by country: For cases with onset at least 14 days, efficacy against molecularly confirmed severe/critical COVID -19 was 73.7% (33.58; 91.24) in in the US and 93.7% (59.62; 99.85) in Colombia. Results for cases at least 28 days after vaccination, and results in the extended data set also show efficacy against severe disease in South Africa. In the extended data set, point estimates are similar across the three countries, as shown in the table below . In conclusion, efficacy against molecularly confirmed severe/critical COVID -19 was observed in South Africa, with a point estimate that was similar compared to the US. CI are however very wide.

Participants with a COVID -19 episode are invited to respond daily if he/she had any of a list of prespecified signs or symptoms during the past 24 hours. The S IC consists of 3 separate parts (symptoms rated from 0 to 10 as part 1, fever as part 2, and 4 separate symptoms as part 3) that are scored separately. If a symptom is present, the participant has to rate the severity on a 10-point scale (from none to 10 w orst possible). Fever was to be scored (fever score) as the maximum recorded temperature for each day during the COVID -19 episode. The participant also indicated if each of the 4 specific symptoms (i.e. uncontrollable body shaking/shivering, decreased sense of smell, decreased sense of taste, red or bruised looking feet or toes) is either present or absent (from 0 to 3, 0 corresponding to none and 3 to severe). The SIC questionnaire was not always completed (such as when a participant was hospital ised and u nable to complete the questionnaire). The total SIC score was calculated for each day of the COVID -19 episode as the mean of all scores. It is however assumed that only the first part was used for the score (with symptoms rated from 0 -10). In participants with moderate COVID -19 (>14 days), a slight reduction of symptom severity in the Ad26.COV2.S group compared to the placebo group is observed, over the first week of the episode. No difference is observed as of one week (symptoms are reported up to 6 weeks) , and the SIC AUC was similar in the Ad26.COV2.S group compared to the placebo group. A post -hoc analysis compared the number of symptoms reported by breakthrough cases. As expected, many cases reported many symptoms. Fewer symptoms were reported in breakt hrough cases of moderate disease for vaccinated compared to placebo subjects. Consistently, efficacy tended to Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 130/218 increase with an increasing number of symptoms. The interpretation of these data is difficult to reconcile with the fact efficacy could be simila r in asymptomatic vs. symptomatic cases.

The full viral load profile across the COVID -19 episode was available for 100 participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 274 participants in the placebo group with confirmed symptomatic COVID -19 with onset at least 14 days after vaccination (w hich is the majority of the 116 Ad26COV vs. 348 Placebo cases). These preliminary data suggest no impact of vaccination on the SARS -CoV-2 viral load levels and duration in COVID -19 breakthrough cases.

Discussion on clinical efficacy Design and conduct of clinical studies Efficacy results were generated in a random ised, double- blind, placebo -controlled, Phase 3 study in adults 18 years of age (COV3001). The study was conducted in the US, several Latin A merican countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Mexico, Colombia), and South Africa. Participants were random ised in parallel in a 1:1 ratio to receive Ad26.COV2.S at a dose level of 5x1010 vp or placebo intramuscularly. Participants were not selected b ased on anti -SARS- CoV-2 serology. Participants with stable medical conditions were allowed to participate in the study, but those with an abnormal function of the immune system resulting from a clinical conditions or drugs were excluded. The target sample size for the study was approximately 40,000 participants. Random isation was stratified by site, age Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 136/218 group (18- <60 years of age vs 60 years of age ), and absence/presence of comorbidities that are or might be associated with an increased risk of progressio n to severe COVID -19. During the assessment of the cMA, the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine has been granted an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in the USA (on February 27, 2021). The applicant, as already planned initially, has submitted two amendments (for study 3001 and for study 1001) to indicate that Ad26.COV2.S vaccine will be offered to enrolled participants who initially received placebo, and that participants and investigators will be unblinded. All participants will be encouraged to remain in the stu dy and continue to be followed for efficacy/effectiveness, safety and immunogenicity as originally planned for up to 2 years post -vaccination. The crossover will result in loss of placebo -controlled follow up. The approach is acceptable considering the cir cumstances. The inclusion of effectiveness studies (US and EU/UK) in the PhV plan is highly supported. The primary objective of study COV3001 is to evaluate the efficacy of Ad26.COV2.S in the prevention of molecularly confirmed, moderate to severe/critical COVID -19 (with onset at least 14 days post - vaccination and with onset at least 28 days post -vaccination as co -primary endpoints), as compared to placebo, in SARS- CoV-2 seronegative adults. The secondary objectives include the evaluation of efficacy in the prevention of molecularly confirmed: (i) severe/critical COVID -19, (ii) mild COVID -19, (iii) COVID -19 as defined by the US CDC (FDA) harmon ised case definition, (iv) all symptomatic COVID -19 (meeting the mild, moderate or severe/critical COVID -19 case def inition), in SARS -CoV-2 seronegative adults, (v) COVID -19 requiring medical intervention. In addition, the evaluation of the effect of Ad26.COV2.S on the occurrence of confirmed asymptomatic/undetected infections with SARS - CoV-2 (using SARS- CoV-2 N protein seroconversion) was part of the secondary objectives. The study does not plan for an evaluation effect on SARS -CoV-2 viral RNA load in asymptomatic cases. Viral load will be assessed as part of the secondary objectives in moderate to severe/critical COVID -19. The assessment of efficacy in participants with comorbidities and according to the degree of frailty are relevant exploratory objectives. Frailty has been shown to be an important factor of mortality, independent of age and other comorbidities 2. Overa ll, the study objectives allow for a comprehensive insight into the effect of Ad26.COV2.S on the whole spectrum of COVID -19 illness. Study procedures allowed for the active surveillance of COVID -19 signs and symptoms, swabbing and virological confirmation of the cases. A broad pre -defined list of symptoms/signs possibly associated with COVID -19 (symptoms from the CDC list and additional symptoms) was used for triggering swabbing to maxim ise the detection of COVID -19 cases. The study procedures to identify and document the COVID -19 events are deemed appropriate and sufficiently detailed. Confirmation testing was done by a central lab at Washington University, using the Tier -1 Abbott Realtime SARS -CoV-2 RT-PCR assay, PCR's. Performance d ata (cross- reactivity and clinical performance) are acceptable. The selected PCR test does not use Spike/RBD targets which minim ises the risk of false -negatives as a result of circulating variants with S -dropout. PCR may underperform when mutations appear in the primer/probe target regions, but this risk is mitigated by using dual target detection. Gene sequencing for the identification of the variants was restricted to the Spike region only. The Swift Biosciences SNAP version 2.0 kit was used on an Illumi na sequencing platform. Because the most critical mutations for antibody evasion are located in the Spike protein, the interim analyses on Spike sequences only is sufficient for the time being. The validation document should be provided with the final report (REC). 2 Hewitt J. et al. The effect of frailty on survival in patients with COVID -19 (COPE): a multicentre, European, observational cohort study. Lancet Public Health 2020; 5: e444 -51. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 137/218 The case definition of moderate COVID -19 includes two sets of criteria using a combination of symptoms and signs. Considering that it is unlikely that mild symptoms occur isolated, it is unclear whether there is an added value (in terms of clinic al relevance/specificity) of requiring a combination of symptoms/signs. It is also unclear why the applicant did not use a definition of 'moderate COVID -19' requiring that the first set of criteria is met (irrespective of the presence of mild symptoms/sign s), more in line with the NIH definition of moderate COVID -19. Instead, at the moment, cases that would be considered mild disease by other case definitions (i.e. only including symptoms compatible with COVID -19 but without signs of LRT involvement) can me et the protocol definition of moderate disease. In conclusion, the applicant used a complex composite definition of moderate COVID -19, of unclear added value. The definition for severe/critical COVID -19 is in line with the definition of severe COVID -19 in the FDA guidance on Development and Licensure of Vaccines to Prevent COVID -19 (June 2020). All potential severe/critical COVID -19 cases are adjudicated in a blinded manner by the Clinical Severity Adjudication Committee (CSAC). The applicant indicated that data on the WHO progression scale could not be provided (data were not captured). The co -primary endpoints consist in a combination of moderate COVID -19 and severe/critical COVID - 19, and moderate COVID -19 itself is a composite endpoint. It is not in line with the guidance 'EMA considerations on COVID -19 vaccine approval' which recommends using 'laboratory -confirmed COVID - 19 disease of any severity' as the primary endpoint. Limitations were raised in the EMA Rapid scientific advice (EMEA/H/SA/4470/1/FU/1/2 020/III). The applicant was advised to consider a simple definition of COVID -19 of any severity, in line with current ECDC, CDC or WHO definitions. This advice was not followed, but in practice, the classification of the cases was very similar when using the primary endpoint case definition or the case definition of 'all symptomatic COVID -19 cases', or the CDC/FDA harmon ised case definition. Therefore, the wording 'COVID -19' is used for the primary endpoint in the SmPC in line with the indication. It would be considered misleading to use the wording 'moderate to severe/critical COVID - 19' as it could suggest that the cases corresponding to the primary endpoint tended to be more severe compared to other vaccines, while it is not the case. The case definition of 'asymptomatic or undetected SARS -COV-2' combining either seroconversion in terms of antibodies against non -S protein (based on systematic sampling in all participants) and/or positive PCR (based on 'accidental' detection of asymptomatic cases) in the ab sence of criteria for suspected COVID -19 based on the signs and symptoms list is supported. The identification of asymptomatic cases thus mainly relies on SARS -CoV-2 non -S protein seroconversion. A Nucleocapsid protein (NP) -based assay (ELISA N protein assay) was used which is a validated assay, with FDA EUA approval. As routinely testing all asymptomatic participants using swab and PCR testing , despite preferable for a clearer understanding of the impact on asymptomatic infection, is logistically challengi ng, the applicant's approach is deemed acceptable. However, this will only provide indirect indications about the effect on the risk of infection. More robust estimation of the vaccine's effect on carriage and shedding should be planned. The indirect effec t of vaccination on unvaccinated persons, should be studied as well. From a statistical point of view, this is a fully sequential trial in which the statistical boundaries were based on a truncated sequential probability ratio test (SPRT). Two co -primary endpoints were predefined based on the case definition with onset of at least 14- and 28 -days post -vaccination, in the per protocol population set at an overall 2.5% one -sided alpha level. The trial positiveness was predefined for a simultaneously superior ity for the two co- primary endpoints against the null value of 30% VE, with both point estimates >50% VE, and 5 cases in the placebo arm. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 138/218 The applicant decided to perform no snapshot analysis but only the primary analysis when the 2 -month median follow -up timepoint was reached (database cut -off date: 22 January 2021). Up to the cut -off date, 259 cases meeting the primary endpoints definition of moderate to severe/critical COVID -19 were observed for events with onset at least 28 days after vaccination, exceeding the targeted prespecified number of 154 cases. The applicant provided the evolution of the different timepoints of the primary analy sis on a cumulative basis, from the beginning of the trial, including when the interim analysis was conducted with the minimal data requirements (17/01/2021) and all final available data used in the primary analysis (22/01/2021) The overrunning is due to t he high number of cases cumulated between the data when minimal data requirements for triggering the IA were met (17/01/2021) and the date of data cut -off (22/01/2021). Thus, the overrunning was apparently due to the high number of cases cumulated in just 5 days. Also, there was an unavoidable slight delay needed for the confirmation on the adjudicated cases. In the end, it is understood that some overrunning would have been impossible to avoid given the high incidence rates derived from the epidemiological curves. Efficacy data and additional analyses A total of 43,783 random ised participants received the study vaccine (21,895 and 21,888 in the Ad26.COV2.S vs placebo arms). This constitutes the Full Analysis Set (FAS). The primary analysis of VE was based o n the Per -protocol Efficacy (PP) population, which includes only participants that were SARS- CoV-2 seronegative at baseline. Of the participants in the FAS, 19,630 (89.7%) and 19,691 (90.0%) were included in PP, respectively in the Ad26.COV2.S vs placebo a rms (total of 39,321). Baseline seropositivity for SARS -CoV-2 was the main reason for elimination from the PP set (n=4,217) and/or being PCR positive at baseline the second reason (n=238). Other reasons were major protocol deviations. Reasons for eliminati on from the PP were balanced across groups. In the FAS, 1,080 (4.9%) and 1,177 (5.4%) participants were unblinded respectively in the vaccine and placebo arms due to request by participants who became eligible to receive an author ised/licensed COVID -19 vaccine. Very few subjects terminated participation prematurely at the time of data cut -off point for the primary analysis (in the FAS 0.2% vs. 0.4%). The main reason for termination was withdrawal by subject. The study was conducted in the US (44%), various countries of Latin America (41%), and South Africa. The representation of South Africa was substantial (15% in the FAS). The proportion of participants 60 years was 35% (in the PP) and the proportion of individuals 65 years was 20%. The proportion of sub jects 75 years was however limited (4% in the PP). Of the participants, 45% were females. There were only few long- term care residents: 0.3% (n=63) vs. 0.4% (n=85) in respective groups (FAS). Participants with comorbidities were well represented. At least one comorbidity was present in 40%- 41% (PP -FAS), -29% in the and type 2 diabetes mellitus (7.5%), followed by serious heart conditions (2.5%), HIV infection (2.5%), asthma (1.5%), COPD (1%). Only very few participants presented comorbidities that are susceptible to significantly affect the immune system (0.2% immunodeficiency condition, <0.1% secondary immunodeficiency, 0.5% malignant neoplasm and 0.5% chronic kidney disease). Only 3% of the subject present 3 or more comorbidities at baseline. The applicant is planning an immunogenicity study in immunocompromised individuals in the PM period. Baseline characteristics were well balanced across arms, overall and within regions. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 139/218 Co-Primary endpoint: Overall, in the PP respectively 54.6% of the Ad26.COV2.S and 54.7% of the placebo participants had a follow -up of at least 2 months after vaccination (calculated as 8 weeks) at the time of the primary analysis. The median follow -up time af ter vaccination was 58.0 days in both arms. For the primary endpoint ('moderate to severe/critical COVID -19') with an onset beyond 14, efficacy was 66.9% (Adjusted 95% CI: 59.03; 73.40). For the primary endpoint with an onset beyond Day 28, efficacy w as 66.1% (Adjusted 95% CI: 55.01; 74.80). Of the 116 vs. 348 cases with an onset beyond Day 14 (respectively in the vaccine vs the placebo group), 66 vs. 193 cases occurred beyond Day 28 (hence nearly half occurred in the period 15- 28 days, i.e. 50 vs. 155). The lower limit (LL) of the CI was well above the pre- specified limit of 30%. Therefore, the primary objective was met for both co -primary endpoints. Symptomatic COVID -19 (any severity): The number of cases and level of efficacy was consistent by using the US FDA Harmonized COVID -19 case definition (67.2% [95% CI: 59.32; 66.7% [95% CI: 55.63; 75.23] based days). The endpoint 's ymptomatic COVID -19' cases (of any severity) included cases classified as either mild, or moderate to severe/critical (per protocol definitions). At least 14 days after vaccination, there were only 1 and 3 mild cases respectively in the active vs. placebo group, in addition to the 116 vs. 348 cases that met the primary endpoint case definition. The vast majority of 'symptomatic COVID -19' cases were thus captured by the primary endpoint. Therefore, the level of efficacy against 'symptomatic COVID -19' the nearly the level of efficacy against the primary endpoint. Number of cases and efficacy were thus in line across the primary endpoint and the secondary endpoi nts 'symptomatic COVID -19' -19 by FDA definition', as those endpoints actually overlap. Moderate COVID -19: Of the primary endpoint 'moderate to severe/critical' COVID -19 cases that occurred at least 14 days after vaccination, most (102 [88%] vs. 288 [83%]) were classified 'moderate COVID -19'. The VE results for least 14 and 28 days, respectively, post -vaccination. The applicant presen ted post-hoc VE data for participants who only met the first set of symptoms of the 'moderate COVID -19' definition, corresponding to the NIH definition (denoted 'Moderate Part 1'). These cases represented only about a third of the primary endpoint cases (4 0 [34%] vs. 125 [36%]). The VE (95% CI) for Moderate Part 1 cases with onset at least 14 days and at least 28 days post -vaccination -19: Efficacy against severe d isease was demonstrated, beyond 14 days and beyond 28 days after vaccination, over a median follow up duration of 58 days. Of the 116 vs. 348 primary endpoint cases with an onset at least 14 days after vaccination, 14 (12%) vs. 60 (17%) were classified as severe/critical (further referred to as severe). The point estimate of VE against severe disease was 76.7% (Adjusted 95% CI: 54.56; 89.09). Of the 66 vs. 193 primary endpoint cases with an onset at least 28 days after vaccination, 5 (8%) vs. 34 (18%) were classified as severe/critical. VE against severe disease was estimated at 85.4% (Adjusted 95% CI: 54.15; 96.90). Severe disease was inferential The lower limit of the 95% CI of 55% was well above 30% for both endpoints (the prespec ified LL was only 0%). Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 140/218 Of the 14 vs. 60 severe cases with onset at least 14 days after vaccination in the Ad26.COV2.S group vs. placebo group, 2 vs. 6 were hospital ised. Three died (all in the placebo group). Based on the data provided during the assessment, it appears that most of the cases were classified as 'severe' based only on abnormal oxygen saturation episodes (SpO2<93%) self -measured (at home). The self - measured SpO2 were not necessarily confirmed by a healthcare worker and values are not corrected for altitude. The CSAS was responsible for taking altitude into account. During the COVID -19 event, at least one measurement was nevertheless taken by the investigator's site or by a home visit by investigator's personnel. All cases were adjudicated as severe based on the clinical independent judgment of the adjudicators, who took into account the overall clinical history of the case. The roles of the Committee and the names of the experts have been provided. Upon request, the Company clarified that all s evere cases have an objective finding of low SpO2 or other abnormal sign but that the rationale for the severity assessment was not recorded in the clinical database. Certainly, it would have been desirable to have that information. Hospitalisation: Beyond 14 days and 28 days after vaccination, there were 2 vs. 8 and 0 vs. 5 cases of molecularly confirmed COVID -19 requiring medical intervention (as collected via the MRU Form ), respectively in the Ad26.COV2.S vs. placebo group. These cases involved hospital isation only, except one case in the placebo group who required ICU admission and mechanical ventilation. In addition, 2 hospitalised cases in the placebo group were not classified severe. Efficacy against molecularly confirmed COVID -19 events requiring hos pitalisation at least 14 days after vaccination, was estimated at 75.0% (95% CI: - 25.28; 97.41). This result was non -conclusive, but in line with the point estimate for severe disease. The finding was supported by post -hoc analyses of all COVID -19 related hospitalisation s implementing a broader search based on all available information from any source in which there was a favorable case split between the Ad26.COV2.S and placebo groups ( beyond 14 days after vaccination 2 vs. 29 in extended data set). Onset o f protection and duration of protection: The cumulative incidence curves of molecularly confirmed moderate to severe/critical COVID -19 cases (Kaplan Meier) for the placebo and vaccinated groups start to separate at Day 14, suggesting that the onset of prot ection is at that time. A plot modelling the difference between the curves suggests that protection is starting to be establish ed around Day 14 and increases up to Day 28 -35, presumably related to maturation of functional immune responses and then stabilise s up to Day 56. How protection persists beyond 8 weeks remains to be addressed with study COV3001 (specific obligation) . Efficacy by level of severity: Whether efficacy is higher against severe cases vs. against mild/moderate symptomatic cases is not confirmed yet, but there is a trend it that direction. It is plausible that t he immunity induced by vaccination could in some instances be insufficient to prevent mild disease (that is counted in the primary endpoint) but sufficient to prevent the infection evolving into more severe COVID -19 disease. Consistently, efficacy tended to inc rease with an increasing number of symptoms. Asymptomatic or undetected cases: Day 71 samples were available for 2,892 participants, which is only about 6% of the FAS seronegative and 19% of the number of samples required for the confirmatory analysis of the 'asymptomatic or undetected' endpoint (15,000 participants who have reached the Day 71 visit). Over the period Day 1 - Day 29, the efficacy point estimate was 12.5% (inconclusive) for the prevention of asymptomatic/undetected SARS -CoV-2 infections, an d 13.1% (inconclusive) for the Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 141/218 endpoint 'seroconversion only'. In contrast, was 59.7% (95% CI: 32.75; 76.64) for the prevention of undetected/asymptomatic of 'seroconversion only' (95% infections' were seroconverters (22 vs. 54 asymptomatic/undetected cases in the vaccine vs. the placebo group, of which 18 vs. 50 were seroconverters). The algorithm in the SAP identi fied asymptomatic participants as those who had no symptoms on the day preceding, the day of, or any time after a positive RT -PCR test. A sensitivity analysis was performed restricted to the participants without any COVID -19 symptoms since screening and yi elded generally similar findings. Findings related to asymptomatic cases based on N protein serology data are very preliminary . These preliminary data are promising, as they suggest efficacy against asymptomatic SARS -COV-2 infection, at a level that may b e consistent with efficacy against symptomatic disease, but this needs to be confirmed over a longer follow with a larger dataset. Viral load during COVID -19 episodes: The full viral load profile across the COVID -19 episode was available for a large propo rtion of the cases. The preliminary data suggest no impact of vaccination on the SARS -CoV-2 viral load levels and duration in COVID -19 breakthrough cases. Extended data set: Due to the delay needed to obtain the results from the central lab (average of 14 days), many cases were not confirmed yet at the time of the primary analysis. A repeat of the analysis was performed in which all COVID -19 cases with a positive PCR result we re analysed , including all cases with a local lab result, not yet confirmed by the central laboratory. This analysis is referred to as the extended dataset analysis. The total number of cases observed >14 days by this 'extended' definition is 173 in the vaccine group and 509 in the placebo group (i.e. 47 and 131 additional cases). Overall, the primary endpoint analyses and the secondary analyses symptomatic cases are supported by the analysis in the extended data set . Cases in seropositive subjects: Of the 4,156 participants SARS -CoV-2 seropositive at baseline, 7 (0.17%) COVID -19 cases were reported as PCR positive from any source (3 vs. 4 in the active vs. placebo group after Day 14) of which one was confirmed by the central laboratory over the study perio d. In contrast, of the 19,822 placebo subjects in the FAS, 617 PCR positive cases were reported from any source (3.11%) over the approximately two- months study period ( average incidence of 19.5 per 100 Person -Years ). Efficacy by age and comorbidities: The efficacy against molecularly confirmed 'moderate to severe/critical COVID -19' at least 14 days and at least 28 days after vaccination was established in the 60 years participants. For events >14 days, efficacy was 76.3% (95% CI: 53.87; 71.58) in participants 18- 59 years. Overall, these results provide clear support for indicating the vaccine in subjects older than 60 years, which is one of the main groups that are at high risk of developing severe COVID -19 complications. Efficacy against molecularly confirmed moderate to severe/critical COVID -19 was observed both in participants with and without comorbidities (point estimates 62.9% and 69.1% for cases with onset at least 14 days after vaccination, and 48.6% and 72.6% for cases with onset at least 28 days after vaccination, for participants with and without comorbidities respectively). The VE point estimates were lower for the participants 'with' vs. 'without' comorbidities, including when stratifyin g by age (18- 59 years vs. 60+ and 18 -64 years vs. 65 years). When considering efficacy >28 days (where the numbers of events are the lowest) for the older participants with comorbidities, the lower limit of the Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 142/218 95% CI was <0. For those cases with onset at least 28 days efficacy was 33.2% (95% CI: - 77.59; ( -85.99; 85.26) for participants 65 years. The 95% CI are very wide, and estimates are based on few events. The same pattern was found in the extended data set , although differences were less marked. It is not considered that there is an efficacy concern in certain subgroups such as older patients with comorbidities. In addition, given the nature of the comorbidities (no immunocompromised participants), there is low biological plausibility for an efficacy issue in these participants. Moreover, efficacy cannot be assessed in participants with 3 comorbidities due to the limited number of cases. Data from subgroups are currently considered preliminary. Length of follow up was the shortest for participants in the older age group (60 years of age), especially for those with comorbidities. Differences across subgroups may be strongly influenced by differences in follow up duration. Differences in terms of timing of vaccination could also affect the interpretation of subgroup analyses across age groups and across participants with/without comorbidities (given the emergence of variants for which efficacy could vary). Efficacy by age an d comorbidities will need to be assessed over a longer follow -up time to generate more robust estimates. More robust data are expected to be provided in the final report of study COV3001 ( SOB). It is noted that follow -up duration may remain an important issue for interpretation of the results in the future given that the elderly participants and those with comorbidities will be unblinded and cross -vaccinated earlier in the trial. Therefore, this should also be addressed in effectiveness studies. Efficacy b y country and circulating variants: Efficacy against molecularly confirmed moderate to severe/critical COVID -19 was demonstrated in each participating country. Except for South Africa, all point estimates were >65% for events with onset at least 14 days af ter vaccination (not computed in Chile and Mexico due to small numbers). In South Africa, efficacy was of lower magnitude compared to other region/countries (39.6% [95% CI: 8.77; 60.46] for cases days and 57.3% [95% CI: 26.51; 76.03] for cases with onset at least 28 days after vaccination). Heterogeneity across regions is much less marked when considering the extended data set (South Africa: 52.0% [95% CI: 30.26; 67.44] for days, 64.0% [95% CI: 41.19; 78.66] for cases with onset at least 28 days after vaccination). There was emergence of new variants reported during the period of the study, especially in South Africa. The applicant performed a sequence analysis restricted to the Spike region. The interim analysis, based on available sequences of approximatively 70% of the cases, confirms the predominant circulation of 20H/501Y.V2 in South Africa (86/91 [94.5%] sequences found, 31 vs 55 in the vaccine and placebo groups respectively) and the D614G -carrying \" WT/ref\" strain in the US (190/197 [96.4%] sequences found, 48 vs 142 in the vaccine and placebo groups respectively). There was no predominant variant in Brazil, but the P.2 (D614G + E484K) lineage represented two third of the cases in Brazil (86/124 sequences found, 27 vs 59 in the vaccine and placebo groups respectively). At the time of the current analysis cut- off, analysis of efficacy per variant was not performed. Spike sequence data were available for only 70% of the cases and a higher proportion of s amples were sequenced in the placebo group when compared to the vaccine group, which could lead to biases. Therefore, an analysis of vaccine efficacy per SARS -CoV-2 variant is planned upon completion of sequencing It assumed that the efficacy observed par ticipants living in South Africa is mainly attributable to the SA variant of concern, as this variant was predominant in this country. Efficacy against molecularly confirmed severe/critical COVID -19 was observed in South Africa, with a point estimate that was similar compared to the US. CI are however very wide. Therefore, the efficacy results obtained are Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 143/218 important in that this vaccine would provide relevant protection in case the South African variant spreads to other countries. Data suggest that onset of protection occurs later in South Africa (around 28 days while overall the onset of protection occurs a 14 days). Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA The final clinical study report for study VAC31518COV3001 will be submitt ed no later than December 2023 and is subject to a specific obligation laid down in the MA, to provide long term follow up data, including data to confirm efficacy in subgroups or data on specific endpoints that were not yet available at the time this asse ssment was carried out. 2.5.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy Efficacy of Ad26.COV2.S in the prevention of symptomatic COVID -19 was demonstrated in SARS -COV- 2 seronegative individuals, over a median follow up period of 8 weeks in a large multiregional trial. Efficacy point estimates were 66.9% and 66.1% for the co -primary endpoints 'moderate to severe/critical COVID -19' with an onset beyond Day 14 and Day 28 respectively. The study showed conclusive evidence since both co -primary efficacy endpoints were met. Efficacy was consistent, with point estimates 65% to 70%, for the various definitions of COVID -19 used in the trial. The vaccine prevented severe disease. The majority of severe events observed in the trial consisted of COVID -19 with ab normal oxygen saturation episodes (SpO2<93%) often based on participant self - measures. All cases were adjudicated as severe based on the clinical independent clinical judgment of the adjudicators. There was a favourable case split between the vaccine and p lacebo groups in terms of hospitalised COVID -19. Efficacy point estimates tend to increase with the level of severity of the case definition. Efficacy was observed in the elderly. Efficacy was also observed in participants with common and stable comorbidities. No data is available for immunocompromised participants. Efficacy was established in the various regions, including South Africa although at a lower level. New variants were emerging during the study period, and most of the strains circulating in Sou th Africa were the variant of concern 20H/501Y.V2. Findings related to asymptomatic cases based on N protein serology data are too preliminary to conclude. These preliminary data are nevertheless promising, as they suggest efficacy against asymptomatic SA RS-COV-2 infection, at a level that may be consistent with efficacy against symptomatic disease. Overall, all these efficacy data provide strong evidence for approval of this vaccine for prevention of COVID -19 in subjects of 18 years and older. Of importa nce, protection in older adults and in subjects infected with a variant (South Africa) SARS -CoV-2 is also demonstrated. More robust data on efficacy by age and comorbidities are nevertheless expected to be provided in the final report, as well as against t he variants. The duration of protection is not known. The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the context of a conditional MA: the MAH should submit the final c linical study report for the randomised, placebo -controlled, observer -blind study VAC31518COV3001. The study subjects are expected to be followed for 24 months after the first dose.

Clinical safety 2.6.1. Patient exposure Overall, 54,586 adults 18 years received Ad26.COV2.S or placebo regardless of the dose level or schedule studies January 2021) (of which 17,940 participants were 60 years of age, 10,746 were 65 years, and 1,848 were 75 years). Of these 54,586 adults, 1,596 adults received 2 doses of Ad26.COV2.S or placebo. An overview of the safety database for participants that received 5x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S up to the cut-off date of each analysis for each study is provided in Table 25.

Unsolicited AEs collected from the day of vaccination until 28 days after each vaccination. b Immediate AEs collected within 30 minutes after vaccination (COV3001 only). c Younger Adults: 18 to 55 years for COV1001 and COV2001; 20 to 55 years for COV1002; 18 to <60 years for COV3001 and COV3009. d Older Adults: 65 years for COV1001 and COV2001; 60 years for COV3001 and COV3009. e In study COV3001, solicited and unsolicited AEs are only collected for the safety subset. f Includes exposure to a single -dose or 2 -dose vaccination regimen with Ad26.COV2.S at the selected dose level (5x1010 vp) wit h at least a 28 -day interval between doses for the 2 -dose regimen. Main clinical study: VAC31518COV3001 In COV3001, a total of 44,325 participants were random ised of whom 43,783 were vaccinated (21,895 in the Ad26.COV2.S 5x1010 vp group and 21,888 in the placebo group) and included in the Full analysis set (FAS). Of these 43,783 participants, 6,736 (3,356 in the Ad26.COV2.S 5x1010 vp group and 3,380 in the placebo group) were included in the safety subset . Of the participants in the FAS, none had completed the study at the time of the analysis. Of the participants in the FAS, 49 subjects (0.2%) in the Ad26.COV2.S 5x1010 vp group and 96 subjects (0.4%) in the placebo group, had discontinued the study prematurely, mainly due to Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 145/218 withdrawal of consent (35 [0.2%] participants and 66 [0.3%] participants in the Ad26.COV2.S and placebo group, respectively). At the time of the primary analysis, the median follow -up after vac cination was 58 days in both groups. Longer safety follow -up of >2 months is available for 23,903 participants in the FAS: 11,948 participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group (54.6%) and 11,955 in the placebo group (54.6%). However, only 34 participants in the Ad 26.COV2.S group (0.2%) and 31 in the placebo group (0.1%) have been followed for close to 4 months. Long -term safety is identified as a missing information in the RMP. Demographic and baseline: Main clinical study: VAC31518COV3001 In the FAS, with a median age of 52 years of age, there were 21,895 adults 18 years of age, including 17,636 adults 18 -64 years of age (80.5%) and 4,259 adults 65 years of age (19.5%) (with 809 adults 75 years of age - 3.7%), including 8,936 adults with comorbidities (40.8%) (w ith 2,271 adults 65 years of age with comorbidities - 10.4%), and including 2,151 adults seropositive at baseline (9.8%), who received Ad26.COV2.S at the selected dose level of 5x1010 vp. In the safety subset, with a median age of 54, there were 3,356 adu lts 18 years of age, including 2,593 adults 18- 64 years of age (77.3%) and 763 adults 65 years of age (22.7%) (with 150 adults 75 years of age - 4.5%), and including 1,135 adults with comorbidities (33.8%) (with 341 adults 65 years of age with comorbid ities - 10.2%), and including 154 adults seropositive at baseline (4.6%), who received Ad26.COV2.S at the selected dose level of 5x1010 vp. There were 1,320 subjects 60 years of age in Ad26.COV2.S group and 1,331 subjects 60 years of age in placebo group. This is in line with protocol requirements which requested to have at least 2,000 elderly participants 60 years of age without comorbidities that are associated with increased risk of progression to severe COVID -19 among the approximately 6,000 participants in the safety subset (including approximately 1,000 Ad26.COV2.S recipients and approximately 1,000 placebo recipients). In the FAS and the safety subset, the demographic and baseline characteristics were similar among participants who received Ad26.CO V2.S or placebo The demographic profile of Ad26.COV2.S was generally similar between the safety subset and the FAS, with the exception of race, country, and serostatus at baseline. In the FAS, participants were mainly from US (44.1%), Brazil (16.6%), South Africa (15%); in addition to Colombia (9.7%), Argentina (6.8%), Peru (4%), Chile (2.6%) and Mexico (1.1%). In the safety subset were included only participants from the US (51.5%), Brazil (38.5%) and South Africa (10.1%), for practical reason (Cf. methodology section). In the safety subset, the proportion of White participants was greater (83.4%) compared to the FAS (58.7%). The proportion of participants who were SARS -CoV-2 seropositive at baseline was lower (4.6%) compared to the FAS (9.6%). Demographic and baseline: Other clinical studies In the Phase 1 and 2 studies ( VAC31518COV1001 [Cohorts 1a and 3], VAC31518COV1002, and VAC31518COV2001), demographics and baseline characteristics were generally well balanced between the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine groups and the placebo groups. In Studies VAC31518COV1001 and VAC31518COV2001, most participants were w hite. Study VAC31518COV1002 was conducted in Japan only. In study VAC31518COV2001, the proportion of males was 63.4 % versus 36.6% of females. In study VAC31518COV1001 Cohort 1b (participants aged 18 to 55 years), a total of 25 participants were random ised and vaccinated. By the cut -off date of 11/01/2021, all participants had completed the study treatment or had discontinued early. Overall, 56.0% of pa rticipants were female and 44.0% were male. The median age was 42 years (range: 22 to 52 years) and the median BMI was 24.8 kg/m 2 (range: 18.8 to 29.9 kg/m2). Most participants were White (88.0%).

Relationship to vaccine is assessed by the investigator. Solicited local reactions During the 7 -day post -vaccination period, the frequency of solicited local AEs was higher in participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group (50.3%), compared to participants in the placebo group (19.5%) (table below). The most frequently reported solicited local AE was vaccination site pain with a frequency that was higher in participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group (48.7%), compared to participants in the placebo group (16.7%). Vaccination site erythema (7.3% vs. 3.9%, respectively) and vaccination site swelling (5.3% vs. 1.6%) were also more frequent in participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group. Local solicited adverse events were mainly grade 1 or 2. The frequency of Grade 3 solicited local AEs was low overall, but higher in participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group compared to participants in the placebo group: vaccination site pain (0.3% vs. 0.1%, respec tively), vaccination erythema and vaccination site swelling (0.2% vs. 0.1%) (no grade 4). All solicited local AEs are considered related to study vaccination by definition. These local solicited AEs are adequately specified, with the appropriate frequencies, in the ADR table in the SmPC.

The median time to onset of the selected solicited local AEs was within 2 days after vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S (including day of vaccination), and within 1 to 2 days with placebo. The median du ration for the most frequent solicited local AEs (vaccination site pain, vaccination site erythema) was 2 days after vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S or placebo. The median duration for vaccination site swelling was 3 days after vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S an d 1 days after placebo. Solicited systemic reactions During the 7 -day post -vaccination period, the frequency of solicited systemic AEs was higher in participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group (55.2%), compared to participants in the placebo group (35.1%) (table below). The most frequently solicited systemic AEs were headache (39% in Ad26.COV2.S group vs. 23.8% in the placebo group), fatigue (38.3% vs. 21.6%, respectively), and myalgia (33.2% vs. 12.8%). Nausea reported at 14.2% in Ad26.COV2.S group vs . 9.7% in the placebo group. Pyrexia (defined as body temperature 38.0\u00b0C, as recorded by the participants) was reported in 302 (9.0%) participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group, compared to 20 (0.6%) of participants in the placebo group. These systemic solicit ed AEs are adequately specified, with the appropriate frequencies, in the ADR table in the SmPC. Most solicited systemic AEs were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity (no grade 4). The frequency of Grade 3 solicited systemic AEs was low overall, but higher in pa rticipants in the Ad26.COV2.S group compared to participants in the placebo group. The most frequently reported Grade 3 solicited systemic AEs reported for fatigue (35 participants - 1%) and myalgia (32 participants - 1%) during the 7- day postvaccination p eriod. Grade 3 headache were reported by 23 subjects (0.7%), and grade 3 nausea by 6 subjects (0.2%). Grade 3 pyrexia was reported in 8 (0.2%) participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group. Among these 8 participants, 7 participants were in the 18 to <60 years age Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 149/218 group and these 7 participants were all <35 years of age. In the 60 years age group, 1 participant reported Grade 3 pyrexia. No Grade 3 pyrexia was reported in the placebo group. Table 28.

Most solicited systemic AEs were transient in nature and reported as resolved. Overall, the median duration of the selected solicited systemic AEs was similar in both groups (1 to 2 days after vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S or with placebo), and also the median time to ons et (within 2 days after vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S and within 2 to 3 days after vaccination with placebo) Supportive studies (COV1001, COV1002 and COV2001) Overall, the solicited and unsolicited AEs in supportive studies were consistent with the pivotal phase 3 COV3001 study. Solicited AEs after dose 1 In all supportive studies, most solicited local and systemic AEs were Grade 1 or 2. No grade 3 solicited local AEs were reported in COV1001 and COV2001, although, a 2% of the participants reported a Grade 3 vaccination site pain in COV1002. The frequency of subjects with any Grade 3 solicited systemic AE in COV1001 was 9.9% in cohort 1a and 0.6% in cohort 3; it was a 7.8% in COV1002 and a 2.9% in COV2001. Solicited AEs administered as 2 -dose regimen Safety data of a 2 -dose regimen of Ad26.COV2.S (5x1010 vp) administered at a 56- day interval was available from COV1001 in 77 adults 18 to 55 years (Cohort 1a) and 81 adults 65 years (Cohort 3) of age. In general, no safety concerns were identified after vacci nation with two doses of Ad26.COV2.S (5x1010 vp) at a 56 -day interval, as no apparent difference was observed regarding the frequencies of solicited local and systemic AEs, and unsolicited AEs, when comparing a one dose and Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 153/218 two dose regimens, in adults age d 18 to 55 and aged 65. There were slightly higher frequencies of solicited systemic AEs after post- dose 1 than after post -dose 2. The main difference was regarding pyrexia. All solicited local AEs and the majority of solicited systemic AEs were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. Lower frequencies of Grade 3 solicited systemic AEs were observed after a second vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S in both age groups. Unsolicited AEs Study VAC31518COV3001 As defined in the protocol, for the participants in the safety subset, the investigator was to record systematically all unsolicited AEs, whether serious or non -serious from the time of vaccination until 28 days post -vaccination. Without such a requirement for a systematic collection of all unsolicited events for those par ticipants in the FAS who were not in the safety subset (although spontaneous unsolicited reports were captured in the eCRF), and although a much larger number of subjects have been vaccinated with Ad26.COV2.S in FAS (21,895), the frequencies calculated in the safety subset (3,356 subjects vaccinated with Ad26.COV2.S) is preferred (higher than in the FAS). The selection of unsolicited AEs to be presented in the ADR table in the SmPC was made applying the following criteria (all criteria had to be met): Event occurred with a frequency of at least 0.1% in the safety subset; The AE was not collected as a solicited AE (to avoid duplication of the event in both solicited and unsolicited sections); The unsolicited AE occurred at a higher frequency (of >0.1%) in the Ad26.COV2.S group compared to the placebo group; A medical review was done to establish plausible connection to the vaccine and to assess confounding factors. Moreover, it has been checked that the unsolicited AEs reported in Ad26.COV2.S FAS (applying the same criteria as for the safety subset) are also present in the ADR table. In the safety subset, the frequency of unsolicited AEs reported during the 28- days post -vaccination period was similar for participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group (13.1%) compared to participants in the placebo group (12%). In the Ad26.COV2.S group, the most frequently reported unsolicited AEs by PT (1.0% of participants) were headache, fatigue, myalgia, and vaccination site pain, which were also recorded as solicited AEs. In the Ad26.COV2.S group, the unsolicited ADRs (not recorded as solicited AEs) selected for the ADR table in the SmPC are chills, arthralgia, malaise, asthenia, muscular weakness and pain in extremity (table below).

Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 154/218 Most reported unsolicited AEs were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity. There was as similar frequency of participants with unsolicited AEs of at least Grade 3 in both group (0.6% in the Ad26.COV2.S group vs. 0.5% in the placebo group). The frequency of unsolic ited AEs that were considered related to vaccination was higher in participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group (7.2%) compared to participants in the placebo group (4.6%) (table below). There was an imbalance between vaccine and placebo in related unsolicited AE s (difference 2 related events in favour of vaccine group) observed for cough (12 related with vaccine vs. 4 in placebo), sneezing (10 vs. 8), oropharyngeal pain (5 vs. 1), tremor (3 vs. 1), back pain (3 vs. 1) and hyperhidrosis (2 vs. 0). These related events have been appropriately added in the ADR table in section 4.8 of the SmPC.

Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 156/218 Table 33: Number of Subjects With Unsolicited Adverse Events of at Least Grade 3 and Related to Vaccination by System Organ Class and Preferred Term; Safety Subset (Study VAC31518COV3001) Supportive studies (COV1001, COV1002 and COV2001) Unsolicited AEs after dose 1 In all studies, most solicited local AEs were Grade 1 or 2. No grade 3 unsolicited AEs (related or not) were reported with dose level 5x1010 vp of Ade26.COV2.S in COV1002 and COV2001. However, in COV1001, only 2 participants in each age group reported severe related unsolicited AEs. Unsolicited AEs administered as 2 -dose regimen Safety data of a 2 -dose regimen of Ad26.COV2.S (5x1010 vp) administered at a 56- day interval was available from COV1001 in adults 18 to 55 years (Cohort 1a) and 65 years (Cohort 3) of age. There was no apparent difference in the frequencies of unsolicited AEs after vaccination with 5x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S post -dose 1 compared to post -dose 2 in adults 18 to 55 years of age. There was slightly higher frequency of unsolicited AEs in participants who received 5x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S. after dose 1 than after dose 2 in adults 65 years of age. Most unsolicited AEs were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. Lower frequencies of Grade 3 unsolicited AEs were obs erved after a second vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S in both age groups. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 157/218 2.6.3. Immediate adverse events In the main study COV3001, the first 2,000 participants in each of the 2 age groups (18 to <60 years and 60 years) remained under observation at the study site for at least 30 minutes after vaccination to monitor for immediate reactions. No early onset had been observed in either age group at the time of the Day 3 safety review of the initial 2,000 participants, therefore the observation period at the study site was reduced to at least 15 minutes for the remaining participants in the study. No anaphylactic or severe hypersensitivity reactions were observed immediately after vaccination (at the cut-off). Anxiety related reactions to vaccination, includin g vasovagal reactions such as syncope and presyncope, were rare (<0.1%) and evenly distributed amongst the Ad26.COV2.S and placebo groups. Immediate unsolicited reactions occurring within 30 minutes of vaccination were infrequent and occurred in 0.2% of pa rticipants in both the vaccine and placebo groups. There were 0.3% of participants with solicited reactions in in the Ad26.COV2.S group (0.3%) compared to participants in the placebo group (0.1%). None of the immediate events reported in the Ad26.COV2.S an d placebo groups were considered serious. These findings are consistent with the safety data of the Ad26- vector platform. 2.6.4. Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events SAEs and deaths in pivotal study VAC31518COV3001 Deaths Up to the cut -off date o f 22 January 2021, fewer deaths were observed in the Ad26.COV2.S group (3 [<0.1%]) compared to the placebo group (16 [0.1%]) (table below). Out of the 16 deaths reported in the placebo group, 6 were confirmed to be associated with COVID -19. There were no deaths confirmed to be associated with COVID -19 in the Ad26.COV2.S group.

Note: Adverse events are coded using MedDRA Version 23.0. All 3 deaths reported in the Ad26.COV2.S group were assessed by the investigator as not related: fatal SAE of lung abscess co -reported with AEs of chest pain, cough, and vomiting in 42 years of age male with a TTO of 32 days, case maybe confounded by under lying condition; negative COVID -19 test result), fatal SAE of pneumonia (reported in 61 years of age female with a TTO of 11 days, negative COVID -19 test result; without any other explanatory factors, the relation of the death to the vaccine cannot be excl uded), and 1 death of unknown cause at the time of data cut -off (in 66 years of age female with a TTO of 44 days, insufficient information to perform a causality assessment, but in the absence of reactogenicity symptoms and long time to onset, the event is considered not related by the applicant). Serious adverse events Overall, 90 [0.4%] subjects in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 137 [0.6%] subjects in the placebo group reported 1 or more SAEs. However, a total of 83 (0.4%) subjects reported SAEs not associated with COVID -19 in the Ad26.COV2.S group compared to 96 (0.4%) subjects in the placebo group. SAEs associated with COVID -19 were reported in the infections and infestations and in the investigations (SARS- CoV_2 test positive) SOCs (system organ class). A total of 8 (<0.1%) participants reported SAEs associated with COVID -19 in the Ad26.COV2.S group compared to 44 (0.2%) participants in the placebo group. Among the SAEs not associated with COVID - 19, overall, no major imbalances were observed by SOC. The most frequently reported SAEs by SOC in the Ad26.COV2.S and placebo groups were infections and infestations (0.1% in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 0.1% [27 participants] in the placebo group) and nervous system disorders (< 0.1% [10 participants] in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 0.1% [8 participants] in the placebo group). Treatment related SAEs Nine participants reported a total of 10 SAEs (7 in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 3 in the placebo group) which were considered to be related to the study vaccine by the investigator. The 7 related SAE reported by 7 subjects in the Ad26.COV2.S group were Grade 4 Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome, Grade 3 radiculitis brachial, Grade 3 post -vaccination syndrome (asthenia), two Grade 2 facial paralysis (Bell's Palsy), Grade 4 p ericarditis and Grade 3 hypersensitivity (angioedema). Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 159/218 Medical attended adverse events MAAEs were reported for all participants from the moment of vaccination until 6 months after the vaccination, except for MAAEs leading to study discontinuation, which w ere to be reported during the entire study. Up to the cut -off date , 304 (1.4%) participants reported one or more MAAEs in the Ad26.COV2.S group compared to 408 (1.9%) participants in the placebo group. Overall, no major imbalances were observed by SOC. The most frequently reported MAAEs by SOC in the COVID -19 vaccine and placebo groups were infections and infestations. SAEs and deaths in supportive studies (VAC31518COV1001, VAC31518COV1002, VAC31518COV2001 and VAC31518COV3009) Overall, safety data o n deaths, SAEs, and AEs leading to study discontinuation are available from supportive clinical studies COV1001, COV1002, COV2001 and COV3009. As most of the data is still blinded, the data reported is aggregated and not divided between the vaccine and pla cebo groups. The studies include >10,500 participants 18 years of age who received either placebo or active vaccine at doses up to 1x1011 vp. In the supportive studies, up to the cut -off date of 11 January 2021 non -related death was reported, and few SAEs were observed. Early discontinuations of vaccination or study due to (S)AEs were infrequent in all groups. A total of 26 participants reported 1 or more SAEs. Of these, 2 SAEs were considered to be related to the study vaccine. In COV1001, a Grade 3 SAE pyrexia was reported post dose 1 of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (1\u00d710 11 vp) and led to discontinuation of further vaccination. A multiple sclerosis event was reported during follow -up post -dose 1 in study COV1001 for a participant who received placebo that led to discontinuation of further vaccination. This SAE was considered related to the intervention by the investigator but was considered chronic and preceding vaccination by an expert neurologis t. In addition, 7 SAEs considered unrelated and 18 nonserious AEs consisting primarily of COVID -19 infections led to discontinuation of the vaccine or study. 2.6.5. Adverse Events of Interest In COV3001, as, per protocol, there were no pre- specified AESIs for Ad26.COV2.S clinical development, the applicant followed a dynamic medical review of incoming AEs to identify potential safety issues. Up to the cut- off date , in the FAS, 140 (0.6%) participants reported at least one treatment emergent AESI in the Ad26.COV2.S group compared to 134 (0.6%) participants in the placebo group. Few reported AESIs were assessed as related: 0.2% in the Ad26.COV2.S group compared to 0.1% participants in the placebo group. For the majority of the reported AESIs, because of lack of plau sible biological mechanism, too long time to onset, alternative explications (such as underlying pathologies) and confounding factors, causality could not be clearly established. Allergic reactions In study COV3001, the most frequently reported AEs in the broad SMQ 'non -anaphylactic allergic reactions' (6 participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group) were rash (24 participants active vaccine including 10 assessed as relate, 16 placebo including 6 related), urticaria (8 participants active vaccine including 3 related, 3 placebo - none related), and hypersensitivity (6 participants active vaccine including 1 related, 4 placebo - none related). Hypersensitivity, rash, urticaria and anaphylaxis have been identified as ADRs in the SmPC. Anaphylaxis has b een include d as an important identified risk in the list of safety concerns of the RMP. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 160/218 Immune -mediated neurological disorders There was 1 subject with Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome in each group (1 possibly related grade 4 SAE in the Ad26.COV2.S group with a plausible tem poral relationship, 1 non -related SAE of Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome in placebo group). The risk of Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome is included in the list of AESIs taken in consideration for routine and additional pharmacovigilance activities. There were 3 cases of B ell's palsy (facial paralysis) in the Ad26.COV2.S group (2 SAE considered as possibly related SAEs by the investigator, but not related by the sponsor; and 1 non -related AE) compared with 2 cases in the placebo group (non -related). Relatedness to the vacci ne cannot be excluded and 2 events of facial paralysis are considered at least possibly related to vaccination. Based on data from reported events, a causal relationship between Ad26.COV2.S vaccination and Bell's palsy could not be confirmed nor ruled out. Bell's palsy is included in the list of AESIs taken in consideration for routine and additional pharmacovigilance activities. Other Nervous system disorders A numerical imbalance observed between the Ad26.COV2.S group and placebo group for: - Tinnitus: Six cases of tinnitus were reported in the Ad26.COV2.S group and none in the placebo group. For these events, a causal relationship with the Janssen COVID -19 vaccine cannot be determined. The assessment of causality was confounded by the presence of underlying medical conditions that could have contributed to these events. - Convulsions/seizures: Four cases were reported in the Ad26.COV2.S group (1 serious) and one case (non-serious) in the placebo group, all of which were considered not related t o the study vaccine by the investigator. The risk of generalised convulsion is included in the list of AESIs taken in consideration for routine and additional pharmacovigilance activities. Injection site bruising There were 22 subjects with haemorrhagic di sorders in the Ad26.COV2.S group compared to 25 in the placebo group. An appropriate warning has been specified in SmPC section 4.4 (i.e. caution in individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals). Thromboembolic disorders A numerical imbalance was observed for the venous thromboembolic events with 11 subjects in the vaccine group vs. 4 in the placebo group. In the vaccine group, there were: 6 DVT type events, 4 pulmonary embolism, 1 transverse sinus thrombosis (including 6 SAEs & 1 non -serious related AE; 8 events occurred within 28 days following vaccination). In the placebo grou p, there were: 2 DVT events, 1 pulmonary embolism, 1 thrombosed haemorrhoid (including 1 related SAE & 1 none- related SAE, all within 28 days of vaccination). The majority of the participants had underlying medical conditions (such as obesity, hypothyroidi sm, diabetes) that could have contributed to the thrombotic and thromboembolic events. Only 1 SAE of DVT was reported with Ad26 vaccine (in adult FAS after 28 days after vaccination) in AdVac report V5. Venous thromboembolism has been included as an import ant potential risk in the list of safety concerns of the RMP. Respiratory disorders AE of asthma was reported for 7 participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group versus 1 participant in the placebo group. For the majority of the participants (including the participant in the placebo group), the assessment of \"not related\" was made considering the nature of the condition and the subject's medical history (including longstanding history of asthma). Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 161/218 In the Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, 10 subjects r eported 10 SAEs in the COVID -19 group (3 Pulmonary embolism, 2 Dyspnoea, 2 Hypoxia, 1 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 1 Pleural effusion, 1 Pneumothorax spontaneous) compared to 4 subjects reporting 6 SAEs in the placebo group (Pulmonary embolism, D yspnoea, Cough, Oropharyngeal pain, Respiratory distress, Respiratory failure). Although the causality is not clear, because there is an imbalance, the risk of exacerbation of chronic pulmonary disorders (i.e. asthma and COPD) might be further monitored in the planned PASS if feasibility is confirmed . Increased HIV acquisition risk The risk for increased HIV acquisition after vaccination with Ad26 -based vaccines is considered to be theoretical. In the AdVac Safety Database V5.0, there were 3 cases of incide nt HIV infection in Ad26 - vaccinated individuals in HIV -V-A004, all captured as SAEs from the same site, which is situated in a high endemic region for HIV infection (all cases presenting risk factors for HIV infection) (compared to none in the placebo grou p). To date, there were no incident HIV infections reported in clinical studies with Ad26.COV2.S. The applicant has been recommended to submit the next version of the Adenoviral Vaccine Safety Database (V6.0) including a discussion of the potential increased risk of HIV acquisition in individuals vaccinated with adenovirus -based vaccines with a review of reported cases in the updated Ad26 platform data (expected for approximatively April 2021) ( see list of recommendations ). 2.6.6. Laboratory findings Clinical laboratory evaluations were only conducted in COV1001, COV1002 (blinded), and COV2001 (blinded). Overall, a low number of laboratory abnormalities were reported as an AE after vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S. In study COV1001 Cohort 1a, laboratory abnormalities w ere reported as AEs (Grade 1 or 2 in severity), in the active vaccine groups but no risk minim isation procedures were considered needed. Examination of safety laboratory assessments at the different timepoints for all vaccination groups showed no notable d ifferences compared with baseline values and/or with values from the placebo group. Overall, the percentages of participants with abnormal safety laboratory values (biochemistry, haematology , coagulation, and urinalysis) were very low and no differences we re noted between vaccine and placebo groups, vaccine dose levels, and first versus second dose. In study COV1002 at the time of the interim analysis, one laboratory -related AE was reported in a participant in the placebo group with Grade 1 C - reactive prote in increased 15 days after the first vaccination. The AE was considered not serious and not related to vaccination. The event resolved by the next measurement which occurred 18 days later. In study COV2001, no laboratory -related AEs were reported post -dose 1. Individual laboratory data at the different timepoints were not available at the time of this analysis. Vital signs measurements included body temperature, pulse/heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure. Overall, a low number of vital sign -related AEs were observed after vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S. In study COV1001 the following vital signs -related AEs were reported: one Grade 3 AE of hypotensive crisis after vaccination which was considered related to the study vaccine by the investigator and one serious Grade 3 AE of decreased blood pressure, one Grade 2 AE of bradycardia, one Grade 2 and one Grade 1 AE of syncope and one Grade 1 AE of hypertension, all of them after vaccination and which were considered unrelated to the study vaccine by the investigator. The event of hypotensive crisis occurred immediately after vaccination and coincided with an anxiety reaction and the applicant is, therefore, of the opinion that the event of hypotensive crisis was anxiety related. As anxiety -related Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 162/218 reactio ns post vaccination are listed in the warnings and precautions section of the SmPC and based on the described vital signs -related AEs, no additional risk minim isation procedures are considered needed. While looking at the Emerging worst vital signs abnormalities in COV1001, frequencies of subjects with abnormalities (bradycardia, hypertension, hypotension, and tachycardia) were comparable in the different groups (active vaccine groups or placebo group). Only the respiratory rate seems increased post-dose 1 in the 5\u00d71010 vp Ad26.COV2.S / 5\u00d71010 vp Ad26.COV2.S group (19.5%) compared to PL/PL group (11.7%). This difference is not seen post -dose 2. In study COV1002 at the time of the interim safety analysis for Cohort 1 one vital signs -related AE of presyncope was reported in a participant who received Ad26.COV2.S at 5x10 10 vp. In COV2001, a total of 4 participants in the Ad26.COV2.S (2 participants in the Ad26.COV2.S 5x1010 vp [0.7%] and 2 in the 1x1011 vp [2.7%] group) were repor ted with hypertension. Overall, 3 participants (all reported in the Ad26.COV2.S 5x1010 vp [1.1%] group) were reported with pyrexia and 2 participants (1 participant in the Ad26.COV2.S 5x1010 vp [0.4%] and 1 in the 1x1011 vp [1.4%] group) were reported with syncope. Other AEs (PTs) occurred in at most 1 participant in the combined Ad26.COV2.S groups. No vital signs -related AEs were reported in the placebo group. No Grade 3 vital signs- related AEs were reported. In study COV3001, up to 28 days post vaccinati on, 14 (0.4%), 7 (0.2%) and 4 (0.1%) of the participants (safety subset) in the Ad26.COV2.S group were reported with pyrexia, hypertension and syncope, respectively, versus 5 (0.1%), 2 (0.1%) and 5 (0.1%) participants, respectively in the placebo group. Ot her AEs (PTs) were reported in at most 1 participant in the Ad26.COV2.S group and/or the placebo group. No Grade 3 vital sign -related AEs were observed after vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S. Two Grade 3 hypertension AEs were reported after vaccination with pl acebo which were considered unrelated to the study vaccine. In COV3009, overall, blinded data (FAS; AEs up to 28 days after the first vaccination) were in line with the observations in COV3001 with the most frequently reported vital signs -related AEs being pyrexia (25 [0.3%] participants overall) and syncope (3 [<0.1%] participants overall). Other AEs (PTs) were reported in at most 2 participants overall. 2.6.7. Safety in special populations The safety parameters were reviewed by subgroup for age at random isation , comorbidity at baseline, by Region, by gender, baseline serostatus and HIV infection. Overall, the safety profile of Ad26 5x1010 was generally similar independently of the subgroups, in particular the frequencies of subjects with SAEs, MAAEs and AESIs (rare). In the Ad26 5x1010 group, for all subgroups, most solicited AEs were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity, and most solicited AEs were transient in nature and reported as resolved. The nature of the local and systemic AEs recorded was similar, showing the s ame pattern as for the pooled population. 2.6.7.1. Age groups Main clinical study: VAC31518COV3001 Overall, the demographic and baseline characteristics were consistent between these age subgroups. However, not surprisingly, in the Ad26 5x1010 group (safety subset), there were less comorbidities at baseline in the younger group (31% for subjects 18 to 64 years of age), compared to the older group (45% for subjects 65 years of age). Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 163/218 In the Ad26 5x1010 group the frequency of subjects with solicited local AEs clearly decreases with age 55.7% for subjects aged 18 to 64 vs. 31.8% for subjects aged 65 years. This lower frequency in participants aged 65 years was reported for all selected solicited local AEs, including the most frequent solicited local AE, ie, vaccination site pain: 54.3% in subjects aged 18 to 64 (86% grade 1, 13.4% grade 2, 0.6% grade 3) vs. 29.6% in subjects aged 65 years (94.3% grade 1, 4.4% grade 2, 1.3% grade 3). The frequency of subjects with solicited systemic AEs also clearly decreases with ag e: 59.6% for subjects aged 18 to 64 vs. 40.2% for subjects aged 65 years. A higher frequency was reported for all selected solicited systemic AEs (fatigue, headache, myalgia, nausea, and pyrexia) in younger subjects. In particular, there were 11% subject s aged 18 to 64 years with pyrexia compared to 2.4% subjects aged 65 years. In the Ad26 5x1010 group, for all the 2 age subgroups, most solicited AEs were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity. There were slightly more grade 1 solicited local and systemics AEs in subjects aged 65 years compared to subjects aged 18 to 64, and less grade 2 solicited local and systemics AEs.

Subjects 18 -64 years of age with comorbidities at baseline shows less local solicited AEs than the subjects 18- 64 years of age wi thout comorbidities, and less systemic solicited AEs than the subjects 18-64 years of a ge without comorbidities. Subjects from 65 years of age with comorbidities at baseline shows similar reactogenicity than the subjects from 65 years of age without comorb idities. No specific concerns arise in the observed safety profile so far. 2.6.7.3. Use in pregnancy and lactation Up to the cut -off date of 31 December 2020, 8 pregnancies were reported in the GMS database for study COV3001: 4 in COVID -19 vaccine group and 4 in placebo group. In the COVID -19 group, 2 pregnancies were still ongoing, and there were 1 spontaneous abortion and 1 ectopic pregnancy (both assessed as not related to vaccine). In the placebo group, 1 pregnancy was still ongoing, and there were 1 incomplete abortion and 2 elective abortions. Although, up to the cut- off date of 31 December 2020, 285 breastfeeding women (128 in Ad26.COV2.S group and 157 in placebo group) were enrolled, no further information regarding breastfeeding was requested during the study. Use during pregnancy and in breastfeeding women are considered as missing information in the RMP. 2.6.7.4. By Region In the safety subset of the main trial COV3001, the frequencies of subjects with local and systemic solicited AEs were slightly higher in Northern America compared to Latin America and Southern Africa in the Ad26.COV2.S group only (differences not observed in the placebo group). 2.6.7.5. By gender In the Ad26 5x1010 group (FAS) regarding the main trial COV3001, there were 12,071 males (55.1%) and 9,820 females (44.9%). Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 165/218 In the safety subset, the frequencies of subjects with local and systemic solicited AEs were higher in females compared to males in the Ad26.COV2.S group only (differences not observed in the placebo group): - In the Ad26.COV2.S group, the frequency of local solicited AEs was higher in female (54.5%) compared to males (46.2%). - In the Ad26.COV2.S group, the frequency of systemic solicited AEs was also higher in female (59.9%) compared to males (50.7%) No major differences are observed for the grade 3 local solicited events (1% in females vs. 0.4% in males). 2.6.7.6. By baseline Serostatus In the Ad26 5x1010 group (FAS) regarding main trial COV3001, there were 2,151 subjects (9.8%) seropositive at baseline and subjects (respectively, 2,066 subjects (9.4%) and 19,822 subjects (90.6%) in placebo group). Overall, the safet y profile of Ad26 5x1010 was generally similar in adults seropositive and seronegative at baseline for SARS -CoV-2. The nature of the local and systemic AEs recorded was similar, showing the same pattern as for the pooled population, without any clinically meaningful differences in frequencies. However, the number of vaccinated subjects who were seropositive at baseline is too limited in the safety subset to draw any definitive conclusions. No specific concerns arise in the observed safety profile so far. 2.6.7.7. By HIV infection In the main trial: COV3001, there were 601 subjects (2.7%) HIV infected at baseline and 8,335 subjects (38.1%) not HIV infected at baseline vaccinated with Ade26.COV2.S. No safety concern was observed in adults with stable/well -controlled HIV infection who received the COVID -19 Vaccine Janssen Nevertheless, the number of vaccinated subjects HIV infected at baseline is too limited in the safety subset to draw any conclusions regarding reactogenicity (34 in Ad26.COV2.S group and 25 in placebo group). Use in immunocompromised patients is identified as a missing information in the RMP. 2.6.7.8. By dose level Supportive Clinical Studies (COV1001, COV1002, COV2001) Safety data from Ad26.COV2.S administered at different dose levels are available from COV1001 (5x10 10 vp and 1x1011 vp) and COV2001 (1.25x1010 vp, 2.5x1010 vp, 5x1010 vp, and 1x1011 vp) in adults 18 to 55 years and 65 years of age and from COV1002 (5x1010 vp and 1x1011 vp) in adults 20 to 55 years of age. Safety data up to 28 days post dose 1 for each study are described below. For COV1001 and COV2001, data post dose 1 were pooled within each cohort by dose level within each study. Overall, no safety concerns were identified after vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S at dose levels up to 1x10 11 vp. The available safety data are supportive of the dose selection for the Phase 3 studies. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 166/218 2.6.8. Immunological events Refer to AESIs for an overview of immunological events. 2.6.9. Safety relate d to drug -drug interactions and other interactions Interaction with another vaccine was not studied. Interaction with other vaccines is identified as a missing information in the RMP. Antipyretics/analgesics were recommended post -vaccination for symptom re lief as needed. In FAS, a similar frequency of subjects used corticosteroids in both group (2.8% in Ad26.COV2.S vs. 2.7% in placebo). In the safety subset, a higher percentage of participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group than the placebo group used antipyretic s/analgesics in this period (19.9% and 5.7% of participants, respectively). The frequencies of subjects with local and systemic solicited AEs were clearly lower in subjects who did not used antipyretics / analgesics (A/A) post -vaccination compared to thos e who used A/A in the Ad26.COV2.S group (and also for the grade 3 solicited AEs): The frequencies of subjects with solicited AEs were slightly lower in subjects who did not used corticosteroids compared to those who used corticosteroids in the Ad26.COV2.S group 2.6.10. Discontinuation due to adverse events In study COV3001: For all participants, all SAEs, AEs and MAAEs leading to study discontinuation were to be reported until completion of the participants last study -related procedure. No AEs or MAAEs resulting in study discontinuation were reported. Up to the cut -off date of 11 January 2021 (COV1001, COV1002, and COV2001) and 14 January 2021 (COV3009): In COV1001, 3 unsolicited AEs resulted in study vaccine discontinuation: 1 Grade 3 SAE of pyrexia reported post -dose 1 in the 1\u00d71011 vp active vaccine (considered related to the study vaccine by the investigator), 1 Grade 1 AE of COVID -19 reported post -dose 1 in the 1\u00d71011 vp, (considered not related to study vaccine); 1 Grade 2 SAE of multiple sclerosis reported in post -dose 1 follow -up in the placebo group). One SAE of nephrolithiasis (Grade 4) was reported during post -dose 1 follow -up for a participant who received active vaccine at the 5x1010 vp dose level which led to discontinuation of further vaccination (consi dered unrelated to the study vaccine by the investigator - acknowledged: past medical history of kidney stones etc...). In COV1002, there were 3 discontinuations due to SAEs (2 blood pressure increased, 1 dizziness postural - all not related) with blinded va ccine. In COV2001, there were 3 discontinuations due to SAEs (not related lung adenocarcinoma and related parasthesia) with blinded vaccine. In COV3009, there were 3 discontinuations due to SAEs (couch, delirium and pleuritic pain - all not related) with b linded vaccine. 2.6.11. Post marketing experience No data available as Ad26.COV2.S has just been authorised through EUA in the US A since 28 February 2021. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 167/218 2.6.12. Supportive clinical safety data of vaccine using the Ad26 Vector As of 04 September 2020, different Ad26 platform -based vaccines developed by Janssen have been administered to 114,174 participants. Safety data are available from six reports: AdVac safety database report V5.0 (4,874 participants enrolled as of the data cut -off date of 20 December 2019), additional reviews of individual case safety reports of SAEs and pregnancy exposures (up to 31 October 2020; cases which were not part of the current AdVac report), complete cumulative reviews of SAEs and pregnancy cases (up to the cut -off of 21 December 2020), and complete cumulative review of neuroinflammatory AEs (up to the cut- off of 21 January 2021). Data from the AdVac safety database report V5.0 supported the accelerated development of the vaccine candidate Ad26.COV2.S for the prevention of COVID -19, incl uding the dose levels used in the FIH. Most of the data are from the Ebola programme. Significant amount of data is also available from the RSV and HIV programme. Data for other inserts are very limited. The majority of enrolled individuals were healthy, B lack or African American, or White. Imbalance between groups observed in the AdVac safety database V5 (in particular, for region and ethnicity) should be explained and the impact on the results should be discussed (see list of re commendations ). Baseline se ropositivity to Ad26 was evaluated in the three large Janssen Vaccines' clinical vaccine programs (Ebola, HIV, and RSV) across various geographic locations and in varying study populations (n=3851). Ad26 seroprevalence varied by continent, with the highest seroprevalence reported in Africa (77.9% [95% CI 75.9;79.7],n=1,872), followed by Asia (41.4% [28.9;55], exclusively in Thailand, n=58), and comparatively low seroprevalence levels in North America (15.1% [13.5;16.9], exclusively USA, n=1,748), and Europe (11.6% [7.4;17.5], n=173). To assess the influence of natural pre- existing immunity to Ad26 on humoral responses, a cross -study analysis was performed by assessing insert -specific Ab specifically post 1 Ad26- based vaccination. Based on the limited data, i t is considered that an impact of pre -existing anti- Ad26 vector immunity on insert specific vaccine -elicited immune responses cannot be excluded. The applicant has also presented the first data obtained in the COVID - 19 program to further document this pote ntial impact of immunity to Ad26. However, the data gathered so far do not allow the assessment of the impact of natural pre -existing anti -Ad26 vector immunity since only 2 subjects had Ad26 nAb at baseline. Of importance, the data of COVID -19 program so f ar do not indicate an apparent negative impact of anti -Ad26 vector immunity induced by the first vaccine dose on the insert specific vaccine -elicited humoral immune responses post- dose 2. The impact on T cell responses was not presented. The potential impa ct of natural or vaccine induced pre-existing anti- Ad26 immunity on vaccine efficacy remains unclear and should be further documented. Further data are expected with the COVID -19 program and would help to better character ise the impact of natural and vacci ne-induced Ad26 immunity on the antigen specific vaccine- induced immune responses, and its possible impact on vaccine efficacy (see list of recommendations ). In healthy younger adults (18-60-year-old), overall, Ad26- based vaccines were well tolerated, irrespective of the insert, the dose level and the dose number; however, safety data have been provided irrespective of dose levels and per subject (cumulating AE after all doses). In next Advac reports, the applicant is recommended to provide the solicited AE separately for dose level 5x1010 (relevant for the COVID -19 vaccination) and other dose levels, and, separately, after dose 1 and after dose 2 (compared to placebo) (see list of recommendations ). Several factors could influence reactogenicity (age, region , pre-existing immunity to Ad26, antigen insert, and dose level). In particular, it has been observed that: The frequencies (per subject) of local solicited AEs following Ad26 was slightly higher in the younger age category (64.0% of adults aged 18- 30 year s) compared to the 31 -50 years and 50 years (56.5% Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 168/218 and 57.2% respectively). The frequencies of systemic solicited AEs following Ad26 was also higher in the younger age category (73.5% of adults aged 18- 30 years) compared to the 31- 50 years and 50 years (62.9% and 62.3% respectively). The frequency of solicited AE local and systemic is generally much lower in West Africa than in other regions (East and Southern Africa, North America, Europe, and Asia), both for the active and placebo groups. Discrepancies across regions could also reflect differences in terms of pre -existing immunity to Ad26 (higher in Africa) and methodological differences between studies. This should be discussed in the next Advac report (see list of recommendations ). Overall, the frequency of solicited local (most notably injection site pain) and systemic AEs (mostly headache, fatigue, myalgia, and chills) tended to be lower in individuals with pre- existing Ad26 neutralising antibody titres (Ad26 VNA positivity at base line) compared to individuals without pre - existing Ad26 neutralising antibody titres at baseline. This was observed for Zabdeno (EPAR) and confirmed by the cross -study analysis summar ised in the report 'Influence of Natural Pre -existing Immunity to Ad26 on Humoral Immune Responses post 1 Ad26- based Vaccination' (Ebola and HIV programmes). The cross- study analysis indicated that the association remained when stratifying by continent. This observation is unlikely to impact the use of the vaccine. The independent effect of pre - existing immunity to the vector on reactogenicity remains not fully clear. For the inserts that have been tested in more than 100 subjects, high differences of frequency of solicited local and systemic AE (all grade and severe - related t o vaccine or not) have been reported depending on the insert. These differences are difficult to interpret given the confounding effect of study location (Africa vs other regions), age distribution, and dose level used. Hence, the independent effect of the insert on reactogenicity remains unclear. This should be discussed in a next Advac report, based on more detailed stratified analyses (see list of recommendations). It is difficult to establish an effect of dose level, as relatively few individuals receiv ed Ad26 doses of 1\u00d710 9 vp, 1\u00d71010 vp, and 9\u00d71010 vp. When only groups with more than 100 individuals were considered (0.8\u00d71010 vp, 2\u00d71010 vp, 5\u00d71010 vp, and 1\u00d71011 vp dose levels), there was a trend towards an increase in the frequency of some local solicited AEs (all grade and severe, in particular injection site pain), and solicited systemic AEs (all grade and severe, and considered related to study vaccine, in particular arthralgia, chills, fatigue, headache, myalgia, and nausea), following the increase in Ad26 dose. There was no clear trend in the frequency of unsolicited AEs with increasing the Ad26 dose. An increased risk of HIV acquisition in individuals vaccinated with adenovirus -based vaccines is considered as an important potential risk. This safety concern has been raised with an Ad5 -vectored HIV vaccine. An increased risk of HIV -1 acquisition was observed in subjects vaccinated with an experimental Ad5- vectored HIV vaccine compared to control subjects (Buchbinder et al ., 2020). It was hypothesised that activated Ad5- specific CD4 T cells could increase rates of HIV -1 acquisition. Although the associati on between risk of HIV -1 acquisition and Ad5 -based (or other Ad- based) vaccines is controversial and the mechanism for increased risk is unclear, this potential risk should be taken into account in studies with this viral vector platform. The overall asses sment of the risk for increased HIV acquisition after vaccination with Ad26 -based vaccines is considered to be theoretical. In the AdVac Safety Database V5.0, t here were 3 cases of incident HIV infection in Ad26- vaccinated individuals in HIV-V-A004, all ca ptured as SAEs from the same site, which is situated in a high endemic region for HIV infection (all cases presenting risk f actors for HIV infection) (compared to none in the placebo group). In study VAC52150EBL2002 (Ebola vaccine), one adult male participant tested HIV seropositive approximately 1 year after receipt of one dose of Ad26.ZEBOV (sexually inactive at study enrolment; no further information available about risk factors for HIV infection). There have been no HIV infections reported in the develo pment programs of RSV, Filovirus, and malaria Ad26 -vectored Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 169/218 vaccines. To date, there were no incident HIV infections reported in clinical studies with Ad26.COV2.S. The next version of the Adenoviral Vaccine Safety Database (V6.0) should be submitted including a discussion of the potential increased risk of HIV acquisition in individuals vaccinated with adenovirus - based vaccines with a review of reported cases in the updated Ad26 platform data (expected for approximatively April 2021). ( see list of recommend ations ) Adults aged 60 years have been included in a Phase 1 and a Phase 2a study of the RSV vaccine clinical development program. In total, 228 individuals aged 60 years received an Ad26.RSV.preF based regimen in these studies. Overall, no safety concerns have been raised to date i n this population. However, data are very limited, and only brief conclusions have been given for adults 60 years. In next Advac reports, the applicant should provide more detailed data by age group (less than 65, between 65- 74, 75- 84 and 85 and above) an d to discuss them (see list of recommendations). In the Ad26 platform safety data, 1,631 pregnancy cases were reported (majority reported in Ebola vaccine trials in DRC and Rwanda) and 939 final pregnancy outcomes were reported: healthy baby for 781, vario us other outcomes for 158 pregnancies (including 102 spontaneous abortions), ongoing for 243, and unknown/not reported for 449. Of these 1,631 pregnancies, caesarean section delivery was reported as delivery method in 193 pregnancies and 61 reported normal delivery. Overall, pregnancy outcomes are consistent with what could be expected in sub -Saharan Africa. For most pregnancies, vaccine exposure took place within 3 months preceding conception (N=464). The number of pregnancy cases is similar for exposure during the first (N=280), second (N=242) or third trimester (N=267) of pregnancy. For 378 cases, time of vaccine exposure was not reported. The number of pregnancies exposed in the first trimester (280) is lower than the threshold of at least 300 pregnanci es exposed to reach a conclusion on the effect on malformation (\"Guideline on risk assessment of medicinal products on human reproduction and lactation: from data to labelling\" EMEA/CHMP/203927/2005). Moreover, although, overall, the cumulative review of p regnancies is promising, a comparison with the frequency of outcomes in pregnancies that were not exposed to Zabdeno is missing to interpret the data adequately. The majority of the reported solicited AE were of low or mild intensity and lasted for few day s after administration of the vaccine. No significant safety issues have been identified to date. Overall, the Janssen Ad26- based vaccines have an acceptable safety profile in all populations studied, including young adults, children and adolescents, 60 -year-old, HIV -infected individuals, pregnant women and individuals with pre -existing Ad26 neutralising antibodies. The numbers of children and adolescents, and individuals 60 -year-old in the safety database is however limited, as well as the number of HIV -infected individuals. Safety data of Ad26- based vaccine in (older) adults with comorbidities, which are relevant for the COVID -19 vaccine, are lacking. Moreover, it is noted that only about 10% of all subjects in the AdVac safety database were European, a nd about one third were White. The absence of safety concern may be considered reassuring in terms of the safety of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine and other future Ad26 based vaccines. However, safety and reactogenicity may be driven by both the platform and the insert. It is noted that differences in the frequency of solicited AEs were reported across inserts, although the independent effect of the insert on reactogenicity and safety is currently unclear (given the confounding effect of factors such as dose level used, age, region, and pre- existing immunity to the vector). Overall, it remains unclear to which extend the safety profile of Ad26 vaccines can be extrapolated from one insert to another. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 170/218 2.6.13. Discussion on clinical safety 2.6.13.1. Exposure The clinical safety database consists of 54,586 adults 18 years who received at least one dose of Ad26.COV2.S or placebo regardless of the dose level or schedule in studies COV3001, COV3009, COV2001, COV1002 and COV1001 up cut -off January 2021 for COV3001 and 11 January 2021 for the others). Ad26- based vaccine p latform clinical safety data, and clinical safety data from studies COV1001 (Phase 1/2a), COV1002 (phase 1 in Japan), COV2001 (phase 2a) (cut -off date for these 3 studies: and the phase III trial COV3009 (cut-off date: 14/01/2021, blinded) are supportive. The assessment of Ad26.COV2.S safety is mainly based on the interim analysis of the results from Phase 3 study COV3001 (cut -off 22/01/2021), comprising 43,783 participants 18 years of age who received e ither a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S at a dose level of 5x1010 vp (21,895 adults) or placebo (21,888 adults) (Full Analysis Set - FAS). Reactogenicity (solicited local and systemic events) and unsolicited adverse events were collected in a subset of 6,736 pa rticipants who received either vaccine (3,356 adults) or placebo (3,380 adults) (Safety subset). At the time of the primary analysis, the median follow -up after vaccination was 58 days in both groups. Longer safety follow -up of >2 months is available for 2 3,903 participants in the FAS: 11,948 participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group (54.6%) and 11,955 in the placebo group (54.6%). However, only 34 participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group (0.2%) and 31 in the placebo group (0.1%) have been followed for close to 4 months. Long -term safety is identified as a missing information in the RMP (uncertainties). In the FAS and the safety subset, the demographic and baseline characteristics were similar among participants who received Ad26.COV2.S or placebo (age, gender, Region, ethnicity, BMI, serostatus at baseline, presence of comorbidities at baseline...). In the FAS, with a median age of 52 years of age, there were 21,895 adults 18 years of age, including 17,636 adults 18 -64 yoa (80.5%) and 4,259 adults 65 yoa (19.5%) (w ith 809 adults 75 yoa - 3.7%), including 8,936 adults with comorbidities associated with an increased risk of progression to severe COVID -19 (40.8%) (with 2,271 adults 65 yoa with including adults seropositive at baselin e (9.8%), who received Ad26.COV2.S at the selected dose level of 5x10 10 vp. Most common comorbidities were obesity (28.5%), hypertension (10.3%), type 2 diabetes mellitus (7.3%), serious heart conditions (2.3%), and asthma (1.3%). Other comorbidities were present in 1% of the participants. In the safety subset, with a median age of 54, there were 3,356 adults 18 years of age, including 2,593 adults 18- 64 yoa (77.3%) and 763 adults (22.7%) 150 adults 75 yoa - 4.5%), and including 1,135 adult s with comorbidities (with 341 adults 65 yoa with comorbidities - 10.2%), and including 154 adults seropositive at baseline (4.6%), who received Ad26.COV2.S at the selected dose level of 5x1010 vp. The demographic profile of Ad26.COV2.S was generally similar between the safety subset and the FAS, with the exception of race, country, and serostatus at baseline. In the FAS, participants were mainly from US (44.1%), Brazil (16.6%), South Africa (15%); i n addition to Colombia (9.7%), Argentina (6.8%), Peru (4%), Chile (2.6%) and Mexico (1.1%). In the safety subset were included only participants from the US (51.5%), Brazil (38.5%) and South Africa (10.1%), for practical reason (Cf. methodology section). In the safety subset, the proportion of White participants was greater (83.4%) Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 171/218 compared to the FAS (58.7%). The proportion of participants who were SARS -CoV-2 seropositive at baseline was lower (4.6%) compared to the FAS (9.6%). Nevertheless, the safety sub set represents a population with diversity by age, gender, race, health status, comorbidities and SARS -CoV-2 serostatus, which includes those most at risk of severe COVID - 19 and is representative of a real -life setting. As a small number of HIV participant s were included in COV3001 safety subset. Use in immunocompromised patients is identified as a missing information in RMP (please see discussion below). Interaction with another vaccine was not studied (missing information in the RMP). Of note, the demogra phic and baseline characteristics were also generally well balanced between the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine groups and the placebo groups in supportive studies (COV1001, COV1002, COV2001). All the participants from Study COV1002 came from Japan. All the adverse reactions reported in the safety subset of the clinical trial COV3001 have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 2.6.13.2. Adverse events Solicited AEs, unsolicited AEs, SAEs (including deaths), MAAEs and AESIs were evaluated. Solicited Adverse Events Reactogenicity in pivotal study COV3001 In the pivotal study COV3001, reactogenicity was assessed in the safety subset. During the 7 -day post -vaccination period, in Ad26.COV2.S group, all solicited local AEs (vaccination site erythema, vacci nation site pain, vaccination site swelling) (50.3%) and solicited systemic AEs (fatigue, headache, myalgia, nausea and pyrexia) (55.2%) were reported more frequently than in control group (19.5% and 35.1% respectively). Pyrexia (defined as body temperatu re 38.0\u00b0C, as recorded by the participants) was reported in 9.0% participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group, compared to 0.6% of participants in the placebo group. The most frequently reported solicited local AE in Ad26.COV2.S group was vaccination site pain ( 48.7% in Ad26.COV2.S vs. 16.7% in placebo group). The most frequently reported solicited systemic AEs were headache (39% in Ad26.COV2.S group vs. 23.8% in the placebo group), fatigue (38.3% vs. 21.6%, respectively), and myalgia (33.2% vs. 12.8%). Solicited adverse events were mainly grade 1 or 2. The frequency of Grade 3 solicited AEs was low overall, but higher in participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group (2.2%) compared to participants in the placebo group (0.7%) (no grade 4). The most frequently reported Gra de 3 solicited local AE was vaccination site pain reported in 0.3% of participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group (vs. 0.1% in placebo group), and the most frequently reported Grade 3 solicited systemic AEs were fatigue (1% in Ad26.COV2.S vs. 0.3% in placebo) an d myalgia (1% vs. 0.2% , respectively). All solicited local AEs are considered related to study vaccination by definition. Most solicited systemic AEs after vaccination were considered to be related to study vaccine: 98.16% (1819/1853) of the solicited systemic AEs were considered related to the study vaccine, and 95.2% (1131/1188) to the placebo. Regarding the severity, most Grade 3 solicited systemic AEs were considered as related to Ade26.COV2.s, there was only one report of grade 3 headache that was not considered related to the study vaccine . Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 172/218 Most solicited AEs were transient in nature and reported as resolved. Overall, the median duration of the selected solicited AEs was similar in both groups (1 to 2 days after vaccination), and also the median time to onset (within 1 to 3 days after vaccination). Reactogenicity in supportive studies (COV1001, COV1002 and COV2001) Overall, the solicited and unsolicited AEs in the supportive studies were consistent with the pivotal phase 3 COV3001 study. Safety data of a 2 -dose regimen of Ad26.COV2.S (5x1010 vp) administered at a 56- day interval was available from COV1001 in 77 adults 18 to 55 years (Cohort 1a) and 81 adults 65 years (Cohort 3) of age. In general, no safety concerns were identified after vaccination with two doses of Ad26.COV2.S compare to 1 dose with similar reactogenicity and unsolicited events. By dose, sligh tly higher frequencies of solicited systemic AEs (main difference regarding pyrexia), and unsolicited AEs were observed post-dose 1 compared to post -dose 2 . . Lower frequencies of Gr ade 3 solicited and unsolicited AEs were observed after a second vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S compared to the first dose in both age groups (adults aged 18 to 55 and aged 65). Unsolicited Adverse events (COV3001) As defined in the protocol, for the part icipants in the safety subset, the investigator was to record systematically all unsolicited AEs, whether serious or non -serious from the time of vaccination until 28 days post -vaccination. Without such a requirement for a systematic collection of all unsolicited events for those participants in the FAS who were not in the safety subset (although spontaneous unsolicited reports were captured in the eCRF), and although a much larger number of subjects have been vaccinated with Ad26.COV2.S in FAS (21,895), th e frequencies calculated in the safety subset (3,356 subjects vaccinated with Ad26.COV2.S) is preferred (higher than in the FAS). The selection of unsolicited AEs to be presented in the ADR table in the SmPC was made applying the following criteria (all cr iteria had to be met): Event occurred with a frequency of at least 0.1% in the safety subset; The AE was not collected as a solicited AE (to avoid duplication of the event in both solicited and unsolicited sections); The unsolicited AE occurred at a higher frequency (of >0.1%) in the Ad26.COV2.S group compared to the placebo group; A medical review was done to establish plausible casual relationship to the vaccine and to assess confounding factors. Moreover, it has been checked that the unsolicited AEs reported in Ad26.COV2.S FAS (applying the same criteria as for the safety subset) are also present in the ADR table. In the safety subset, the frequency of unsolicited AEs reported during the 28- days post -vaccination period was similar for participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group (13.1%) compared to participants in the placebo group (12%). In the Ad26.COV2.S group, the most frequently reported unsolicited AEs by PT (1.0% of participants) were headache, fatigue, myalgia, and vaccination site pain, which were also recorded as solicited AEs. In the Ad26.COV2.S group, the unsolicited ADRs (not recorded as solicited AEs) selected for the ADR table in the SmPC are chills, arthralgia, malaise, asthenia, muscular weakness and pain in extremity. Most reported unsolicited A Es were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity. There was as similar frequency of participants with unsolicited AEs of at least Grade 3 in both group (0.6% in the Ad26.COV2.S group vs. 0.5% in the placebo group). The frequency of unsolicited AEs that were consider ed related to vaccination was higher in participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group (7.2%) compared to participants in the placebo group (4.6%). There were an imbalance between vaccine and placebo in related unsolicited AEs (difference 2 related events in favo ur of vaccine group) observed for cough (12 related with vaccine vs. 4 in placebo), sneezing (10 vs. 8), oropharyngeal pain (5 vs. 1), tremor (3 vs. 1), back pain (3 vs. 1) and hyperhidrosis (2 vs. 0). These related events have been appropriately added in the ADR table in the SmPC. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 173/218 Five subjects (0.1%) reported 6 unsolicited AEs of at least Grade 3 considered to be related to the study vaccine in the Ad26.COV2.S group (compared to 1 in placebo group): 1 chill, 1 fatigue, 1 malaise, 1 diarrhoea, 1 pain in ex tremity and 1 headache (none of grade 4). Of note, no imbalance was observed in the frequency of unsolicited AEs in the Nervous System Disorder class between the Ad26.COV2.S and the placebo group in the FAS or the safety subset (all AEs or related AEs). Immediate unsolicited reactions occurring within 30 minutes of vaccination were infrequent and occurred in 0.2% of participants in both the vaccine and placebo groups. There were no reports of anaphylaxis immediately following vaccination (at the cut- off). 2.6.13.3. Treatment -emergent AESIs (COV3001) As, per protocol, there were no pre- specified AESIs for Ad26.COV2.S clinical development, the applicant followed a dynamic medical review of incoming AEs to identify potential safety issues for conditions including, but not limited to immune mediated and/or (neuro) inflammatory events (e.g., hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylaxis, Guillain -Barr\u00e9 Syndrome, Bell's palsy) and thrombotic and thromboembolic events (e.g., pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis). Treatment emergent AESIs were evaluated in the FAS. Up to the cut- off date , in the FAS, the same frequency of subjects reported at least one treatment emergent AESI in both groups (0.6%). Few reported AESIs were assessed as related: 0.2% in the Ad26.COV2.S group compared to 0.1% participants in the placebo group. Allergic reactions In this study, the most frequently reported AEs in the broad SMQ 'non -anaphylactic allergic reactions'(6 participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group) were rash (24 participants active vaccin e including 10 assessed as relate, 16 placebo including 6 related), urticaria (8 participants active vaccine including 3 related, 3 placebo - none related), and hypersensitivity (6 participants active vaccine including 1 related, 4 placebo - none related). Events of urticaria and rash were considered as likely related to the vaccine. Further assessment of the events under the PT 'hypersensitivity' showed most of these events to be either seasonal allergies or allergy to a medication other than the vaccine. In addition, an SAE of type IV hypersensitivity (Grade 3), not classified as anaphylaxis, was reported in 1 vaccinated individual with rash and erythema from day 2 after vaccination, and urticaria and angioedema of the lips without respiratory distress from day 4 . This case does not meet the Brighton Collaboration criteria for anaphylaxis. The event was assessed as Type IV hypersensitivity and was considered likely related to the vaccine due to the close temporal association. Moreover, since the data lock, the applicant received a SUSAR report of pyrexia, swollen tongue, and dyspnoea from study VAC31518COV3012 (ongoing study in South Africa). The participant received Ad26.COV2.S in an open label fashion. This case with 1 major respiratory criterion (tongue s welling) and 2 minor criterion (dyspnoea and urticaria) meets the Brighton Collaboration case definition criteria for anaphylaxis with level 2 of diagnostic certainty. Of note, another SUSAR of anaphylaxis was received from the same study, but the event is confounded in underlying COVID -19 infection (the symptoms included headache, fever, chills and dizziness). This case with 1 major cardiovascular criteria of hypotension and no other major or minor criteria does not meet the BCCD of anaphylaxis. Additional information has been requested by the applicant for further assessment. Hypersensitivity, rash, urticaria and anaphylaxis have been identified as ADRs in the SmPC. Finally, anaphylaxis is considered as an important identified risk in the RMP . Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 174/218 Immune -mediated neurological disorders There was 1 subject with Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome in each group (1 possibly related grade 4 SAE in the Ad26.COV2.S group with a plausible temporal relationship, 1 non -related SAE of Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome in placebo group). The event of Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome is included in the list of AESIs taken in consideration for routine and additional pharmacovigilance activities. There were 3 cases of Bell's palsy (facial paralysis) in the Ad26.COV2.S group (2 SAE considered as possibly r elated SAEs by the investigator, but not related by the Sponsor; and 1 non -related AE) compared with 2 cases in the placebo group (non -related). Relatedness to the vaccine cannot be excluded and 2 events of facial paralysis are considered at least possibly related to vaccination. Participants had underlying medical conditions (diabetes, hypertension, obesity) that could also have contributed to the event. Overall, b ased on the reported data f, a causal relationship between Ad26.COV2.S vaccination and Bell's palsy could not be confirmed nor ruled out. Bell's palsy is included in the list of AESIs taken in consideration for routine and additional pharmacovigilance activities. Other Nervous system disorders A numerical imbalance observed between the Ad26.COV2.S group and placebo group for: - Tinnitus: Six cases of tinnitus were reported in the Ad26.COV2.S group and none in the placebo group. All these cases were considered non -serious. Two cases were considered related by the investigator. Review of the cases revealed no pattern in terms of temporal association with the vaccine (Time to onset range 1 to 22 days). All participants had underlying medical conditions (such as history of tinnitus and migraine, history of hypertension, seasonal allergies and hypothyroidism) or used medications that offered a more plausible alternative cause for the event than the vaccine. None of these events have reported further complications such as hearing loss. In addition, there was only one case of tinnitus in the safe ty database from the AdVac platform (RSV program). - Convulsions/seizures: Four cases were reported in the Ad26.COV2.S group (1 serious) and one case (non-serious) in the placebo group, all of which were considered not related to the study vaccine by the investigator. Majority of the subjects had underlying medical conditions (such as dementia/epilepsy and diabetes) were present that could have contributed to the events of convulsions/seizures. The risk of generalised convulsion is included in the list of A ESIs taken in consideration for routine and additional pharmacovigilance activities. Injection site bruising There were 22 subjects with haemorrhagic disorders in the Ad26.COV2.S group compared to 25 in the placebo group. There were 13 AESIs of injection s ite bruising (including contusion, haematoma and ecchymosis) with Ad26 5e10 compared to 10 in placebo. An appropriate warning has been specified in SmPC section 4.4 (i.e. caution in individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals). Thromboembolic disorders A numerical imbalance was observed for the venous thromboembolic events with 11 subjects in the vaccine group vs. 4 in the placebo group. The majority of the participants had underlying medical conditions (such as obesity, hypothyroidism, diabetes) that could have contributed to these events. In order to assess the impact of vacci nation on coagulation, and the risk of inducing a hypercoagulable state, it has been requested to include laboratory tests for the assessment of potential vaccine -induced antiphospholipid syndrome and vaccine -induced activation of coagulation (lupus anticoagulants, anti - beta 2 glycoprotein, anti -cardiolipin and D -dimers), pre and post vaccination in further subjects Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 175/218 enrolled; and to perform assessments of, at least, anti -cardiolipin lgG and lgM, and anti -2- Glycoprotein 1 IgA, IgG, IgM in frozen serum mater ial pre - and post -first and second vaccination. One SAE of DVT was reported with Ad26 vaccine (in adult FAS after 28 days after vaccination) in AdVac report V5. Venous thromboembolism has been included as an important potential risk in the list of safety concerns of the RMP. Respiratory disorders AE of asthma was reported for 7 participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group versus 1 participant in the placebo group. For the majority of the participants (including the participant in the placebo group), the assessment of \"not related\" was made considering the nature of the condition and the subject's medical history (including longstanding history of asthma). In the Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, 10 subjects reported 10 SAEs in the Ade26.COV 2.S group (3 Pulmonary embolism, 2 Dyspnoea, 2 Hypoxia, 1 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 1 Pleural effusion, 1 Pneumothorax spontaneous) compared to 4 subjects reporting 6 SAEs in the placebo group (Pulmonary embolism, Dyspnoea, Cough, Oropharyngea l pain, Respiratory distress, Respiratory failure). Increased HIV acquisition risk The risk for increased HIV acquisition after vaccination with Ad26 -based vaccines is considered to be theoretical. In the AdVac Safety Database V5.0, there were 3 cases of i ncident HIV infection in Ad26 - vaccinated individuals in HIV -V-A004, all captured as SAEs from the same site, which is situated in a high endemic region for HIV infection (all cases presenting risk factors for HIV infection) (compared to none in the placebo group). In study VAC52150EBL2002 (Ebola vaccine), one adult male participant tested HIV seropositive approximately 1 year after receipt of one dose of Ad26.ZEBOV (sexually inactive at study enrolment; no further information available about risk factors for HIV infection). There have been no HIV infections reported in the development programs of RSV, Filovirus, and malaria Ad26 -vectored vaccines. To date, there were no incident HIV infections reported in clinical studies with Ad26.COV2.S. The next version o f the The applicant is recommended to submit the Adenoviral Vaccine Safety Database (V6.0) including a discussion of the potential increased risk of HIV acquisition in individuals vaccinated with adenovirus -based vaccines with a review of reported cases in the updated Ad26 platform data (expected for approximatively April 2021) ( see list of recommendations ). Conclusion on AESIs Besides the numerical imbalances described above, there were no notable patterns or numerical imbalances between the Ad26.COV2.S a nd placebo group for treatment -emergent AESIs (including neurologic, neuroinflammatory, and cardiovascular events) that would suggest a causal relationship to the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. The overall total number of cases of AEs of interest observed in the stu dy were low and within the rates observed in the general population. For the majority of the reported AESIs, because of lack of plausible biological mechanism, not plausible time to onset, alternative explications (such as underlying pathologies) and confo unding factors, a causality could not be clearly established. Finally, the absence of a clear causal association is further enforced by the safety data from the platform. SAEs and deaths Pivotal study COV3001 In study COV3001, SAEs (including deaths) were evaluated in the FAS. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 176/218 Fewer deaths were observed in the Ad26.COV2.S group (3, none confirmed to be associated with COVID -19) compared to the placebo group (16, including 6 confirmed to be associated with COVID - 19). All 3 deaths reported in the Ad26.COV2.S group were assessed by the investigator as not -related to vaccination : fatal SAE of lung abscess , fatal SAE of pneumonia , and 1 death of unknown cause at the time of data cut- off . Until the cut -off date , in the FAS, 90 ( 0.4%) subjects in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 137 ( 0.6%) subjects in the placebo group reported 1 or more non -fatal SAEs. However, a total of 83 (0.4%) subjects reported SAEs not associated with COVID -19 in the Ad26.COV2.S group compared to 96 (0.4%) subjects in the placebo group. SAEs associated with COVID -19 were reported in the infections and infestations and in the investigations ( preferred term: SARS- CoV_2 test positive) SOCs. Among the SAEs not associated with COVID -19, overall, no major imbalances were observed by SOC. The most frequently reported SAEs by SOC in the Ad26.COV2.S and placebo groups were infections and infestations and nervous system disorders. For the nervous system disorders, 10 subjects reported 12 SAEs in the COVID -19 group (compared to 8 subjects reporting 8 SAEs in the placebo group). Six SAEs are considered related to the Ad26.COV2.S (2 Facial paralysis, 1 Cerebral haemorrhage, 1 Guillain -Barre syndrome, 1 Radiculitis brachial and 1 Transverse sinus thrombosis: please Cf. AESIs discussed before). None were considered related in the placebo group. For the respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, an imbalance was observed with 10 subjects reported 10 SAEs in the COVID -19 group (3 Pulmonary embolism, 2 Dyspnoea, 2 Hypoxia, 1 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 1 Pleural effusion, 1 Pneumothorax spontaneous) compared to 4 subjects reporting 6 SAEs in the placebo group (Pulmonary embolism, Dyspnoea, Cough, Oropharyngeal pain, Respiratory distress, Respiratory failure). None were assessed as related to vaccine in both groups. An imbalance was also observed for the hepatobiliary disorders with 4 subjects reported 4 SAEs in the COVID -19 group (2 Cholecystitis acute, 1 Cholecystitis, 1 Cholelithiasis) compared to 1 subject reporting 1 SAE in the placebo group (Cholecystitis chronic). None were assessed as related to vaccine in both groups. There were no (S)AEs leading to discontinuation. Supportive studies (COV1001, COV1002 and COV2001) Safety data on deaths, SAEs, and AEs leading to study discontinuation are available from supportive clinical studies COV1001, COV1002, COV2001, and COV3009. The studies include >10,500 participants 18 years of age who received either placebo or active vaccine at doses up to 1x1011 vp (the vast majority had o nly a follow up of 26 days). As of the cut- off date, only 1 death was reported (accidental death of a COV3009 participant). Few SAEs and early discontinuations due to AEs were observed in all groups. The available data from the supportive studies does not raise any safety concern. Medically attended Adverse Events Pivotal study COV3001 In study COV3001 MAAEs were evaluated in the FAS Until the cut -off date , in the FAS, 1.4% participants reported one or more MAAEs in the Ad26.COV2.S group compared to 1.9% participants in the placebo group. Overall, no major imbalances were observed by SOC. The most frequently reported MAAEs by SOC in the COVID -19 vaccine and placebo Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 177/218 groups were infections and infestations (0.5% in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 0.8% in the placebo group). By PT, COVID -19 infection was the most frequently reported MAAE for 16 (0.1%) of participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group compared to 35 (0.2%) participants in the placebo group. When evaluating the MAAEs not associated with Covid -19, up to the cut -off date , 286 (1.3%) participants reported one or more MAAEs in the Ad26.COV2.S group compared to 361 (1.6%) participants in the placebo group (and 0.3% grade 3 in each group). As expected, the majority of MAAEs associated with COVID were in the infections and infestation SOC. There were 0.1% of related MAAEs (not associated with covid- 19) in both groups. Most of these are discussed in the SAE and AESI sections. In the Ad26.COV2.S group, the MAAEs were m ainly in the following SOCs: nervous system (2 facial paralysis, 2 headache, 1 Guillain -Barre syndrome, 1 radiculitis brachial, 1 syncope) and general disorders and administration site conditions (2 pyrexia, 1 chills, 1 influenza like illness, 1 injection site reaction, 1 vaccination site hypersensibility, 1 vaccination site swelling). 2.6.13.4. Clinical laboratory parameters An evaluation of the clinical laboratory parameters was included in COV1001, COV1002a and COV2001 (haematology, chemistry COV1002a, and haematology in COV2001). Overall, a low number of laboratory abnormalities were reported as an AE after vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S. 2.6.13.5. Safety by subgroup (COV3001) Overall, the safety profile of Ad26 5x1010 w as similar independently of the subgroups, in particular the frequencies of subjects with SAEs, MAAEs and AESIs (rare). In the Ad26 5x1010 group, for all subgroups, most solicited AEs were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity, and most solicited AEs were transie nt in nature and reported as resolved. The nature of the local and systemic AEs recorded was similar, showing the same pattern as for the pooled population. However, the following differences were noted: By age group: The reactogenicity was milder and lower in older adults aged 65 years compared to the younger adults aged 18 to 64. Overall, the demographic and baseline characteristics were consistent between the different age subgroups. However, as expected, in the Ad26 5x1010 group (safety subset), there were less comorbidities at baseline in the younger group (31% for subjects 18 to 64 years of age), compared to the older group (45% for subjects 65 years of age). Adults with comorbidities at baseline: The reactogenicity was lower in participants with an y comorbidity at baseline than in adults without any comorbidity. The difference in reactogenicity profile by comorbidities was observed in adults aged 18- 64, but no difference was observed in adults aged 65. Subjects 18 -64 years of age with comorbiditie s at baseline reported less local solicited AEs than the subjects 18- 64 years of age without comorbidities, and less systemic solicited AEs than the subjects 18-64 yoa without comorbidities. Subjects from 65 years of age with comorbidities at baseline rep orted similar reactogenicity than the subjects from 65 years of age without comorbidities. By Region: Subjects from Northern America reported a higher percentage of reactogenicity than subjects from Latin America and Southern Africa. However, differences i n the demographic and Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 178/218 baseline characteristics, as well as cultural differences in AE reporting in clinical practice, could interfere with this observation. By gender: Females reported a higher percentage of reactogenicity than males (although both subgrou ps had a similar median age). By baseline seropositivity: The nature of the local and systemic AEs recorded was similar, showing the same pattern as for the pooled population, without any clinically meaningful differences in frequencies. However, the number of vaccinated subjects who were seropositive at baseline is too limited in the safety subset to draw any definitive conclusions. Seronegative subjects 18- 64 years of age reported similar frequency of local solicited AEs than the seropositive subject s 18-64 years of age , and slightly more systemic solicited AEs than the seropositive subjects 18- 64 years of age . Seronegative subjects from 65 years of age reported less local solicited AEs than the seropositive subjects from 65 years of age , and similar frequency of systemic solicited AEs than the seropositive subjects from 65 years of age . By HIV infection at baseline: The frequency of local and systemic solicited AEs was slightly lower in HIV infected adults at baseline. However, the number of vaccina ted subjects HIV infected at baseline is too limited in the safety subset to draw any conclusions regarding reactogenicity (34 in Ad26.COV2.S group and 25 in placebo group). Concomitant therapies The frequencies of subjects with local and systemic solicited AEs were clearly lower in subjects who did not use antipyretics / analgesics (A/A) post -vaccination compared to those who used A/A in the Ad26.COV2.S group (and also for the grade 3 solicited AE s). The frequencies of subjects with solicited AEs were slightly lower in subjects who did not use corticosteroids compared to those who used corticosteroids in the Ad26.COV2.S group. Use in pregnancy In COV3001, up to the cut -off date of 31 December 2020, 8 pregnancies were reported in the GMS database for this study: 4 in COVID -19 vaccine group and 4 in placebo group. In the COVID -19 group, 2 pregnancies were still ongoing, and there were 1 spontaneous abortion and 1 ectopic pregnancy (both assessed as no t related to vaccine). In the placebo group, 1 pregnancy was still ongoing, and there were 1 incomplete abortion and 2 elective abortions. In the Ad26 platform safety data (cut -off 21 December 2020), of the 1,631 unique pregnancies (majority reported in Eb ola vaccine trials in DRC and Rwanda), 939 final pregnancy outcomes were reported: healthy baby for 781, various other outcomes for 158 pregnancies (including 102 spontaneous abortions), ongoing for 243, and unknown/not reported for 449. Overall, pregnancy outcomes are consistent with what could be expected in sub -Saharan Africa. The number of pregnancy cases reported is similar for exposure during the first (N=280), second (N=242) or third trimester (N=267) of pregnancy. For 378 cases, time of vaccine exposure was not reported. The number of pregnancies exposed in the first trimester (280) is lower than the threshold of at least 300 pregnancies exposed to reach a conclusion on the effect on malformation (\"Guideline on risk assessment of medicinal products on human reproduction and lactation: from data to labelling\" EMEA/CHMP/203927/2005). Although, overall, the cumulative review of pregnancies did not reveal any safety concern related to Ad26- based vaccine exposure during pregnancy, a comparison with the fr equency of outcomes in Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 179/218 pregnancies that were not exposed to the Ad26 - vaccine is missing in order to interpret the data adequately. The applicant has categor ised the use of Ad26.COV2 during pregnancy as an area of missing information in the RMP. An open -label, Phase 2 study to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S in healthy pregnant participants (Trial VAC31518COV2004) and a COVID -19 Vaccines International Pregnancy Exposure Registry (C -VIPER) are planned. In COV3001, up t o the cut -off date of 31 December 2020, 285 breastfeeding women (128 in Ad26.COV2.S group and 157 in placebo group) were enrolled. However no further information regarding breastfeeding was requested during the study. Use in pregnancy and while breastfeedi ng is considered as missing information in the RMP. Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA The final clinical study report for study VAC31518COV3001 will be submitted no later than December 2023 and is subject to a specific obligation laid down in the MA, to confirm the safety profile of Ad26.COV2.S COVID -19 vaccine and provide long term safety data. 2.6.14. Conclusions on the clinical safety The safety evaluation of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine is based on the interim analysis of the results from Phase 3 study COV3001 (cut -off 22/01/2021), comprising 43,783 participants 18 years of age who received either a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S at a dose level of 5x1010 vp (21,895 adults) or placebo (21,888 adults) with a median of 2 months of follow -up aft er vaccination. Reactogenicity was collected in a subset of 6,736 participants who received either vaccine (3,356 adults) or placebo (3,380 adults). The safety of Ad26.COV2.S is mainly characterised by local and systemic reactions occurring during the first 7 days after vaccination. Reactions were mostly mild to moderate and transient. The reactogenicity was milder and lower in older adults aged 65 ye ars compared to the younger adults aged 18 to 64. There has been observed higher reactogenicity in females than in males and lower reactogenicity in subjects with 1 or more baseline comorbidities than those without any comorbidity, mainly observed in part icipants aged 18 -64. There was no major difference in the reactogenicity between seropositive and seronegative participants at baseline and by race/ethnicities. SAEs and AESIs were infrequent in the Ad26.COV2.S and placebo groups. Although no specific risk has been identified, a causal relationship between Ad26.COV2.S vaccination and Guillain -Barr\u00e9 Syndrome, Bell's Palsy and chronic pulmonary disorders exacerbation (i.e. asthma and COPD) could not be confirmed nor ruled out. Guillain -Barr\u00e9 Syndrome and Bell 's Palsy are included in the list of AESI and taken in consideration for routine and additional pharmacovigilance activities. The risk of exacerbation of chronic pulmonary disorders (i.e. asthma and COPD) might be further monitored in the planned PASS if f easibility is confirmed . Vaccine -associated enhanced disease (VAED), including vaccine -associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD), and Venous thromboembolism are considered as important potential risks. Anaphylaxis is considered as an important identified risk. More frequently reported AESIs in the vaccine group, rash, urticaria, and hypersensitivity are included as Adverse reactions in the PI. Anaphylaxis has also been included in the SmPC section 4.8 . In conclusion, the observed safety profile is c onsidered as favourable. The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the context of a conditional MA: the MAH should submit the final clinical study report for the randomised, Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 180/218 placebo -controlled, observer -blind study VAC31518COV3001. The study subjects are expected to be followed for 24 months after the first dose. (see Annex II of the product information ). Regarding missing data to confirm safety in subpopulations that were not studied or whose data are limited please refer to section 2.7. 2.7. Risk Management Plan Safety concerns The applicant has submitted an RMP including the following summary of safety concerns: Sunmmary of safety concerns Important identified risks Anaphylaxis Important potential risks Vaccine -associated enhanced disease (VAED), including vaccine - associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) Venous thromboembolism Missing information Use in pregnancy and while breastfeeding Use in immunocompromised patients Use in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders Use in frail patients with comorbidities (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], diabetes, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders) Interaction with other vaccines Long-term safety Risks considered important for the inclusion i n the summary of safety concerns Anaphylaxis has been added as an important identified risk based on one confirmed case of anaphylaxis (Brighton Collaboration Level 2 of diagnostic certainty) reported in the op en label study VAC31518COV3012. Anaphylaxis is known to possibly occur with any injectable vaccine. Ad26.COV2.S contains polysorbate 80 whose structure presents similarities with PEG, recently suspected to be involved in anaphylactic reactions with mRNA vaccines. The potential for polysorbate 80 to trigger hypersensitivity and the possibility of cross -reactivity between PEG and PS80 have been discussed in the literature3;4. Cases of PS80-induced hypersensitivity have been reported and have involved different drugs, including a vaccine, and different routes of administration, including intramuscular 5;6;7. Anaphylaxis is also anticipated to be reported in the context of larg e-scale vaccination, where many more individuals will be vaccinated. Moreover, mass vaccination campaigns may involve healthcare 3 Castells MC, Phillips EJ. Maintaining Safety with SARS -CoV-2 Vaccines.

Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 181/218 professionals who do not routinely administer vaccines and should therefore be fully aware of the risk minim isation measures re lated to anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is thus considered as an important identified risk. The analysis of safety data provided in the cMAA identified Venous thromboembolism as an important potential risk : inclusion was proposed, based on the numerical imbalanc e observed in the Ad26.COV2.S group vs the placebo group (i.e. 11 vs 4 cases; including 6 vs 2 SAEs) (refer to section 2.6.5 for further details). Additional PV activity are planned to further characterise this risk . It is recommended that the study will i nclude laboratory testing for evaluating potential vaccine -induced antiphospholipid syndrome and vaccine -induced activation of coagulation lupus anticoagulants, including vaccine -associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD)' was included as an important potential risk. At this stage, VAERD/VAED is still a theoretical risk. Non -clinical studies with Ad26.COV2.S -immun ised Syrian hamsters and NHP did not show evidence of VAED or VAERD, but showed an induction of neutralising antibodies and a Th1- skewed immune response after Ad26.COV2.S dosing, suggesting that the theoretical risk of VAERD and VAED for Ad26.COV2.S is low. Data from clinical trials did not show any indication of the presence of VAED, including VAERD. However, as long -term safety and efficacy data are not yet available, the risk VAED/VAED remains an important potential risk. Missing information: 'Use in pregnancy and while breastfeeding ': considering the limited data in pregnant women vaccinated with the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (i.e. 8 pregnancies reported for trial COV3001; 4 in Ad26.COV2.S group and 4 in placebo group) and the planned Phase 2 study VAC31518COV2004, this issue should be included as missing information and further characterised as part of the pharmacovigilance plan. Considering the limited data in vaccinated breastfeeding women (i.e. 128 breastfeeding women received Ad26.COV2.S in trial COV3001), this population is considered as missing information. 'Use in immunocompromised patients ': the Ad26 platform data in HIV infected adults and the absence of replication of Ad26.COV2.S suggest that no safety issue is expected in this population. This should be further supported by clinical data from trial COV3009 as available. At the time of cM AA, no safety issue was raised in HIV subjects vaccinated with Ad26.COV2.S in the trial COV3001. However, only a very limited number of vaccinees were included in the Full Analysis Set (i.e. 601 (2.7%)). Moreover, HIV patients under treatment may represent a distinct population from other immunocompromised subjects, including patients under immunosuppressive treatment, transplant patients or patients with hereditary and/or acquired immunodeficiency disease states. Additional pharmacovigilance activities are planned to monitor this safety concern. 'Use in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders ': other sub -populations with clinical conditions stable under non -immunomodulator treatment (e.g. autoimmune thyroiditis, autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic disease such as rheumatoid arthritis) were included at very low number clinical development precluding the provision of meaningful data. This safety concern will be monitored as part of the pharmacovigilance plan. 'Use in frail patients with co- morbidities (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders) ': subjects with comorbidities associated with increased risk of severe COVID -19 were included in the clinical development plan: i.e. 8, 936 (40.8%) of vaccinees with one or more comorbidities were included in the COV3001 Full Analysis Set. However, the safety and efficacy of frail subjects who also have comorbidities associated with increased risk for severe COVID -19 has not yet been asses sed and is considered as missing information. Additional pharmacovigilance activities are planned to characterise this missing information. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 182/218 'Interaction with other vaccines ': co-administration of Ad26.COV2.S with other vaccines has not been evaluated in c linical trials. However, data on interaction, mainly with flu and pneumococcal vaccines which are often given to elderly, are needed for vaccinators and prescribers. An interventional clinical trial is planned to further characterise this missing informati on. 'Long term safety data ': long term safety data are available at the time of the cMAA. The relevance of the long -term follow -up is discussed, and adequate pharmacovigilance activities are proposed. Risks not considered important for inclusion in the summary of safety concerns The reactogenicity is in line with what can be expected from a vaccine, and it is considered acceptable to not include those events in the list of safety specifications. As usually observed, the reactogenicity profile differs with age, with lower and milder reported solicited events in older adults. Anxiety -related reactions can occur in anticipation or as a result of an injection of any kind. These reactions are not related to the vaccine, but to fear of the injection. The most commonly reported manifestations are fainting (syncope and presyncope), hyperventilation, vomiting. A statement on those reactions is included in section 4.4, and it is agreed that they do not require further characterisation or risk minimisation. Vaccination errors may be introduced in the context of mass vaccination campaign. The following situations have been identified as potential source of immunisation errors: risk to erroneously administer Ad26.COV2.S twice as a 2 -dose schedule is implemented for other authorised vaccines in EU; risk to administ er a higher dose of Ad26.COV2.S as multidose vials will be used, risk for Ad26.COV2.S being erroneously administered in adolescents aged 16- 17 years as this age group is included in the indication of other manufacturer's COVID -19 vaccines, and finally risk of mixed schedule. . Risk minimisation activities in the form of communication messages in the PI are considered adequate to minimise the risk. Vaccination errors reports will be monitored in the PSURs and monthly reports. 'Exacerbation of chronic pulmona ry disorders ( i.e. asthma and COPD)' : (i.e. asthma and COPD)' An AE of asthma was reported for 7 participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group versus 1 participant in the placebo group. For the majority of the participants (including the participant in the placebo group), the assessment of \"not related\" was made considering the nature of the condition and the subject's medical history (including longstanding history of asthma). Besides, 1 subject reported 1 SAE of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the COVID -19 group compared to none in the placebo group. Although the causality is not clear, because there is an imbalance with a significative number of cases with Ad26.COV2.S, the risk of exacerbation of chronic pulmonary disorders (i.e. asthma and COPD) should be followed. Adverse events of special interest (AESI) are taken in consideration for routine and additional pharmacovigilance activities. A set of AESI has been identified taking into consideration the available lists of AESIs from the Brighton Collabora tion (SPEAC) (Law 2020), ACCESS protocol (2020), US CDC (preliminary list of AESI for VAERS surveillance) (Shimabukuro 2020), and MHRA (unpublished guideline). The proposed list of AESI is considered dynamic and may change following the evolving safety profile of the vaccine. Currently, medical conditions covered by the list of AESIs include Immune -mediated and (neuro -)inflammatory disorders (including Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome an d Bell's palsy), Thrombotic and thromboembolic events, Major organ disorders (in cluding neurological, cardiovascular, hepatic, and respiratory), Events associated with COVID -19. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 183/218 Conclusions on the safety specification It is agreed that the list of safety concerns in the RMP are appropriate. Pharmacovigilance plan Routine pharmacovigilance activities The applicant will follow standard pharmacovigilance processes, along with the additional actions referenced in the EU -RMP. The applicant has a Global Safety Database in place to manage the receipt, processing, and reporting of individual and aggregate safety data to regulatory authorities, and to support pharmacovigilance activities including safety signal detection and ongoing evaluation of the benefit -risk profile of the vaccine. ICSR reporting The applicant will submit Indiv idual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) in accordance to EMA GVP guidance. Follow -up for spontaneous and solicited ICSRs ICSRs are followed up promptly to obtain additional information relevant to the report as necessary to provide a complete description of the safety event. Two specific adverse reaction follow up questionnaire s will be used to collect follow -up information on reports of anaphylaxis, and vaccination failure/lack of effect, including events of VAED and VAERD. Monthly summary safety reports In line with EMA's 'Consideration on core requirements for RMPs of COVID -19 vaccines' guidance. the applicant will submit monthly safety reports containing a review of safety information received during the reporting interval, as well as cumulative data. T opics covered by the monthly safety reports will include , at a minimum : Interval and cumulative number of reports stratified by report type (medically confirmed/not) and by seriousness (including fatal separately). Interval and cumulative number of reports , overall and by age groups, and in special populations (e.g. pregnant women). Interval and cumulative number of reports per High Level Term and System Organ Class. Summary of the designated medical events. Reports per EU country. Exposure data (including per EU country). Changes to reference safety information in the interval. Ongoing and closed signals in the interval. AESI and RMP safety concerns reports - numbers and relevant cases, including O/E analysis, where appropriate. Fatal reports - numbers and relevant cases, including O/E analysis, where appropriate. Risk/benefit considerations. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 184/218 Pregnancy outcomes and sudden death are AEs of interest that will each be discussed in separate sections of the periodic reports. The need and frequency of s ubmission of the summary safety reports will be reevaluated based on the available evidence from post -marketing six months after the conditional marketing authorisation of the vaccine. Literature review Literature monitoring for Ad26.COV2.S includes both a n automated daily search for published and pre- publication/online first references in 2 commercial database products (Embase and Ovid Medline), as well as a daily manual review of one or more literature aggregator services. Search criteria include any COVID-19 vaccine product, irrespective of manufacturer or vaccine technology, and a report of AE(s) without restriction by seriousness or severity. References retrieved by the above search strategies are reviewed by a healthcare professional and are escalated based on reporting of either new safety observations or new aspects of known risks that require further assessment. Signal Investigation All available safety information across clinical investigations, post- marketing data, and all other sources of informat ion is reviewed on a regular basis. Other sources of pertinent data may include nonclinical studies, manufacturing and product quality reports, relevant publications, epidemiology data, data from external safety databases, safety -related health authority a nd healthcare provider queries, and safety -related health authority communications and assessment reports. Routine aggregate signal detection will include regular surveillance of AE reports received in the applicant 's Global Safety Database, irrespective o f country of origin, seriousness, medical confirmation, or validity, as well as reviews of external databases. The Table below shows an outline of data sources and frequency of monitoring. Data source Frequency of monitoring applicant 's database Weekly for temporal and disproportionality analyses Time to onset analysis as proof of concept every 2 weeks FDA VAERS Weekly data review and monthly data mining EudraVigilance Weekly data mining WHO VigiBase Data mining every 3 months Methods for signal detection activities will include: a. Disproportionality analysis b. Time-to-onset analysis c. Temporal analysis d. O/E analysis, when applicable Traceability The SmPC includes instructions for healthcare professionals to: Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 185/218 clearly record the name and lot number of the administered vaccine to improve traceability (SmPC section 4.4); report any suspected adverse reactions including batch/lot number if available (section 4.8). Traceability is available for every shipping container of Ad26.COV2.S, which is fitted with a unique device that provides real -time monitoring of geographic location 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Each device will also trace the batch/lot of the associated shipment. The device is activated prior to shipment and informati on is transmitted wirelessly to the applicant at a predefined cadence until delivery to each country's government distribution center. Each shipment will be accompanied by a passive temperature datalogger. Alarms for excursions (per predefined specificatio ns) are programmed into the device. If the display on the device doesn't show an alarmed status, the vaccine can be received. If the display shows an alarmed status, the product needs to be stored in the appropriate temperature conditions upon arrival and the receiver needs to follow the applicant 's instructions for reporting an alarmed shipment. These data may be used for the assessment of a safety signal. The vaccine carton box also includes a 2D matrix barcode which has the batch/lot number, GTIN product code, and expiry date, should there be capability at a vaccination site to util ise this as an information source. Further, the applicant will make available vaccination cards to vaccinees that may be completed at the time of vaccination. The vaccination cards contain the following elements: Pre-printed vaccine brand name and manufacturer name. Placeholder space for name of vaccinee. Placeholder space for date of vaccination and associated lot number. For EEA countries, reference to the National Reporting System for AE reporting. QR code and URL (www.covid19vaccinejanssen.com) for additional product information. In addition to the vaccination cards, 2 stickers per dose, containing pre -printed vaccine brand name, lot information, and a 2D matrix ba rcode will be made available to support documentation of the lot information on both the vaccination cards for vaccinees and in the vaccinee medical records in mass vaccination centers. It is acknowledged that some countries may require util isation of nati onally mandated vaccination cards or electronic systems to document the lot number; therefore, the available vaccination cards and stickers with printed lot information may not be utilised in all countries. The use will depend on national requirements and/ or national competent authority guidance. The following milestones apply for the availability of the stickers with printed lot information: For EEA countries: sticker sheets with printed lot information will be provided at the same time and alongside the v ial cartons from initial launch. Projected 2022: Upon development and approval of single- dose vials, stickers with printed lot information will be available inside the vial box or carton around it. The proposed routine pharmacovigilance activities are considered appropriate for the safety profile of the product and the pandemic circumstances. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 186/218 Additional pharmacovigilance activities The applicant proposes the following 11 studies to further evaluate safety and effectiveness, and to address missing information in the post marketing setting. There are six interventional studies and five non-interventional studies (five safety and two on effectiveness).

The new EURD list entry will there fore use the 25 February 2021 to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 2.9. New Active Substance The applicant declared that adenovirus type 26 encoding the SARS -CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (Ad26.COV2 -S) has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in the European Union. The active substance Ad26.COV2.S is a recombinant adenoviral vector that contains the sequence that encodes the SARS -CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. After administration, the replication incompetent adenoviral particles w ill infect cells and the sequence encoding the SARS -CoV-2 spike glycoprotein will be transcribed into mRNA and subsequently translated into SARS -CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (which will Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 193/218 serve as antigen to evoke an immune response). Although the adenoviral par ticle itself does not contain any SARS -CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, the coding sequence of the SARS -CoV-2 spike glycoprotein is an integral part of the genome of the adenoviral construct. Therefore, the adenoviral particle as an entity should be considered as active substance (and not just the coding sequence of the SARS- CoV-2 spike glycoprotein). Although recombinant replication incompetent a denovirus serotype 26 has been previously used in different constructs, this vector has never been used for expression of SARS- COV-2 spike glycoprotein and/or as a Covid -19 viral vector vaccine. Other Covid -19 vaccines or medicinal products that are currently registered do not contain recombinant replication incompetent Ad26 viral vector expressing SARS -CoV-2 spike glycoprotein as active substance. In conclusion, since a medicinal product containing recombinant, replication -incompetent adenovirus serotype 26 vectored vaccine encoding the SARS -CoV-2 spike glycoprotein has not been previously authorised in the EU, the active substance Ad26.COV2.S (recombinant, replication -incompetent adenovirus serotype 26 vectored vaccine encoding the SARS -CoV-2 spike glycoprotein) is considered a new active substance in itself. The CHMP, based on the available data, considers adenovirus type 26 encoding the SARS -CoV-2 spike glycoprotein ( Ad26.COV2 -S) to be a new active substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 2.10. Product information User consultation The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of the label and package leafl et of medicinal products for human use. Labelling exemptions The following exemptions from labelling and serialisation requirements have been granted on the basis of article 63.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC. In addition, the derogations granted should be seen in the context of the flexibilities described in the Questions and Answers on labelling flexibilities for COVID -19 vaccines (EMA/689080/2020 rev.1, from 16 December 2020) document which aims at facilitating the preparedness work of COVID -19 vaccine developers and the associated logistics of early printing packaging activities. The ultimate goal is to facilitate the large scale and rapid deployment of COVID - 19 vaccines for EU citizens within the existing legal framework. EU packaging specific derogations a) Outer and immediate labelling in English only (from start of supply until end 2021) Outer and immediate labelling will be provided in English only for all EU Member States, as well as Norway and Iceland. Country/language specific outer/immediate labelling shall be p rovided in all EU languages by beginning 2022. This exemption is justified on the necessity to provide maximum flexibility of supply and speed of Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 194/218 vaccine production/deployment due to the ongoing pandemic. Production of d ifferent vaccine packs in different languages will significantly reduce the supply chain efficiency. The multiple changes on packaging lines will result in significant time and capacity losses and would slow down the rapid deployment of COVID -19 vaccines. The use of unified English -only pack components will allow the vaccine to be distributed across multiple countries simultaneously. A QR code and URL printed on the outer carton, QR card and the patient information leaflet will provide access to the product information in the national language(s). b) Printed package leaflet in English only (from start of supply until end 2021) A printed package leaflet (PL) will be provided in the national language(s) for those MSs that require so. All other MSs, that have granted a temporary exemption for an English -only PL, will receive the English printed PL. Moreover, the MAH shall contact MSs directly to agree on the exact numbers of PLs to be distributed in line with the published Q&A on labelling flexibilities . A QR code and URL printed on the outer carton, QR card and the PL will provide access to the package leaflet in the national language(s) . Moreover, the MAH shall contact MSs directly to agree on the exact numbers of PLs to be distributed in line with the p ublished Q&A on labelling flexibilities. The MAH shall provide a printed package leaflet in all EU languages by beginning 2022. The MAH shall engage with the National Competent Authorities (other than the 6 mentioned above) to discuss and speed up the pro vision of PLs in the respective national language(s) of the MSs concerned. The MAH shall also contact MSs directly to agree on the exact numbers of PLs to be distributed, again in line with the published Q&A on labelling flexibilities. c) Outer and immedia te labelling. Temporary omission of certain particulars on the labelling (from start of supply to end 2021). The following exemptions are temporarily agreed for the outer labelling. These exemptions are justified on the necessity to label batches ahead of time. Outer carton and printed package leaflet o Common name: 'COVID -19 vaccine (Ad26.COV2- -19 vaccine (Ad26.COV2- S [recombinant])' (agreed during evaluation [with square brackets]). This exemption on the common name is temporarily agreed for the outer carton and the printed package leaflet for the first batches until end 2021. Outer carton o Statement of the active substance. Due to the expedited development, product specifications were not final at the early stage of printing packaging materials. Therefore, the statement of active substance will be fully omitted from the outer carton for the first batches until end 2021. o Abbreviated MAH name and company logo d) EU Marketing Authorisation number (from start of supply to end 2021) The inclusion of the EU Marketing Authorisation number in the labelling will be implemented with the switch to national variants of the EU packaging by beginning 2022. The MA number will be available on the electronic version of the EUPI. e) Blue Box (from start of supply to end 2021) Due to the use of one unified pack across all the EU countries, an exemption for the Blue Box has been Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 195/218 granted to omit it from the outer carton. The information normally provided in the market specific packaging Blue Box area of the carton will be provide d as an electronic version on the website (via the QR code/URL) under the country page, if required by the National Competent Authorities in each MS. The QR code and URL address (website) will be made available on the PL, carton box and QR card. The Blue B ox will be included in the updated carton component when national variants of the packaging will be possible by beginning 2022. f) QR card (from start of supply to end 2021) One QR card will be supplied in each carton box. The QR card will include a QR cod e and an URL address (website) that links to an electronic product information translated in all EU languages. h) Manufacturers responsible for batch release (from start of supply to end 2021) Due to the use of two manufacturers responsible for batch rele ase for the supply of this vaccine in the EU, an exemption is requested for not indicating which is the manufacturer responsible for the release of the concerned batch in the printed package leaflet. This request is justified to meet capacity demands, and to ensure there is sufficient flexibility to accommodate for possible delays at some manufacturing sites or unavailability of release capacity. Both manufacturers responsible for the batch release will be listed in the printed package leaflet. In addition, the following sentence: \" For the specific manufacturer of the vaccine you have received, check the Lot number on the carton or vial and please contact the local representative of the Marketing Authorisation Holder .\" will be included in the package leaflet for traceability purposes. Exemption from the obligation of serialisation - All EU Member States have accepted a temporary derogation from serialisation for the EU pack for a period of 3 months starting from the EC decision date. - the MAH shall provide monthly progress reports on the serialisation: referring to details on the progress achieved in terms of ensuring compliance, e.g. proof of acquiring the relevant equipment, the date for the validation, the proof of contract to connect to the European Medicines Verification Organisation; - the MAH shall provide additional mitigating measures, e.g. immediate reporting of any stolen product during the period of exemption, reporting of any counterfeit or falsified vaccine in the EU or third countries in the le gal supply or internet, reconciliation of product distributed and used in the respective territory; - the MAH should also consider technical solutions to the serialisation due to the risk of falsification. The following safety features were endorsed: proprietary name Janssen varnish on via label and folding box; digital watermark on vial and folding box; hidden image on folding box; glues anti tamper evident flaps. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 196/218 Quick Response (QR) code A request to include a QR code in the labelling and the package leaflet for the purpose of providing information to Healthcare Professionals and vaccine recipients has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable. The following elements have been agreed to be provided through a QR code: Statutory information Approved regulatory information, including the patient information leaflet (PIL) and Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC); Vaccination Card; Blue Box information as required by each Member State; Storage, dosing and administration b rochure; Access to the national reporting systems for adverse events websites; Contact numbers for more information on the COVID -19 vaccine including product quality complaints; Link to the COVID -19 vaccine Janssen on the EMA website. Addit ional monitoring Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, COVID -19 Vaccine Janssen (adenovirus serotype -cov-2 spike glyco protein (Ad26.COV2 -S)) is included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU and it is approved under a conditional marketing authorisation. Therefore , the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a stat ement that this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 3. Benefit -Risk Balance 3.1. Therapeutic Context Disease or condition The claimed indication for COVID -19 Vaccine Janssen is active immunisation for the prevention of coronavirus disease -2019 (COVID -19) in adults greater than or equal to 18 years of age. COVID -19 is a respiratory disease caused b y the novel coronavirus SARS -CoV-2. The virus has spread worldwide during 2020, causing WHO to declare a pandemic in March 2020. The virus infects the airways and causes a broad spectrum of respiratory symptoms ranging from asymptomatic infection to Sever e Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and ARDS. The pandemic is still ongoing despite unprecedented efforts to control the outbreak. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 197/218 Available therapies and unmet medical need COVID -19 case management has evolved during 2020 and includes, among others, anti -viral therapy and anti -inflammatory agents. In EU, remdesivir has been granted a conditional marketing authorisation for the treatment of COVID -19 in adults and adolescents (from 12 years of age and weighing at least 40 kg) with pneumonia who require supplemental oxygen (low - or high -flow oxygen or other non -invasive ventilation at start of treatment) based on positive results in some subgroups from clinical study NIAID -ACTT-1, in which remdesivir could speed up the recovery time with 4 to 6 days (Beigel 2020, EMA 2020b). Dexamethasone can be considered a treatment option for adult and adolescent patients who require supplemental oxygen therapy based on published data from the RECOVERY study which showed a relative reduction in the number of deaths within 28 days of 35% compared to usual care in patients on invasive mechanical ventilation and 20% in patients receiving oxygen therapy without mechanical ventilation. There remains an urgent public health need for the rapid development of novel prophylactic therapies, including vaccines, both for protection of particularly vulnerable groups as well as mitigating the effects of the pandemic on a population level. Several vaccine candidates are being developed and three of them (Comirnaty, COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna , and COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca) were granted a conditional marketing authorisation in the EU. There is a very high global demand for suitable vaccines to help counteract the ongoing pandemic. Main clinical studies Five studies are ongoing with Ad26.COV 2.S, of which 3 Phase 1/2 studies evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of Ad26.COV2.S and 2 large phase 3 trials evaluate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S in adults. The first efficacy trial, VAC31518COV3001, is the pivotal study for this application. The trial VAC31518COV3001 is a random ised, double- blind, placebo -controlled, Phase 3 study in adults 18 years of age conducted in the US, several Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Mexico, Colombia), and South A frica. Participants were random ised in parallel in a 1:1 ratio to receive Ad26.COV2.S at a dose level of 5x10 10 vp or placebo intramuscularly. Individuals are planned to be followed for up to 24 months. The trial design was revised after EUA in the US (on February 27, 2021) to offer Ad26.COV2.S vaccination within the trial (for participants who had received placebo), and unblinding of participants and investigators. All participants will be encouraged to remain in the study and continue to be followed for e fficacy/effectiveness, safety and immunogenicity as originally planned for up to 2 years post -vaccination on Day 1. A total of 43,783 random ised participants received the study vaccine (21,895 and 21,888 in the Ad26.COV2.S vs placebo arms). Random isation was stratified by site, age group (18- <60 y ears of age vs 60 years of age), and absence/presence of comorbidities that are or might be associated with an increased risk of progression to severe COVID -19. 3.2. Favourable effects Efficacy of Ad26.COV2.S for the co -primary endpoint 'moderate to severe/critical COVID -19' with an onset from Day 14 after vaccination was 66.9% (adjusted 95% CI: 59.03; 73.40) over a median follow -up time of 58.0 days, in seronegative individuals . For the co -primary endpoint 'moderate to severe/critical COVID -19' with an onset from Day 28 after vaccination, efficacy was 66.1% (adjusted Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 198/218 95% CI: over the same period, in seronegative individuals . The primary objective was met for both co- primary endpoints s ince the lower limit (LL) of the 95% CI of vaccine efficacy were above the pre- specified limit of 30%. Number of cases and efficacy estimates were consistent when using the US FDA Harmonized (CDC) COVID -19 case definition or when using the endpoint 'sympt omatic COVID -19' cases which include cases classified as either mild, or moderate to severe/critical days). There were very few mild cases, and the vast majority of 'symptomatic CO VID-19' cases were thus captured by the primary endpoint. These data therefore support an indication against COVID -19 of any severity. For this reason, 'COVID -19' is used in the SmPC section 5.1 to describe for the primary outcome of the study. It is consi dered misleading to use the exact primary endpoint of 'moderate to severe/critical COVID -19' as it could suggest that the cases corresponding to the primary endpoint were more severe compared to other vaccines' trials, which is not the case. Efficacy agai nst severe disease was demonstrated. Of the 116 vs. 348 primary endpoint cases with an onset at least 14 days after vaccination in the vaccine vs. placebo group respectively, 14 (12%) vs. 60 (17%) were classified as severe/critical (further referred to as severe, also in the SmPC). The point estimate of VE against severe disease was 76.7% (adjusted 95% CI: 54.56; 89.09) over a median follow up of 58 days, in SARS -COV-2 seronegative subjects. Of the 66 vs. 193 primary endpoint cases with an onset at least 28 days after vaccination in the vaccine vs. placebo group respectively, 5 (8%) vs. 34 (18%) were classified as severe. VE against severe disease was estimated at 85.4% (adjusted 95% CI: 54.15; 96.90) over the same follow -up period in seronegative subjects. Of the 14 vs. 60 severe cases with onset at least 14 days after vaccination in the Ad26.COV2.S group vs. placebo group, 2 vs. 6 were hospital ised. Three died (all in the placebo group). Most of the remaining cases only fulfilled the oxygen saturation (SpO2 ) criterion for severe disease (SpO2< 93%). For many cases this was based on self -measured abnormal oxygen saturation episodes (at home). During the COVID - 19 event, at least one measurement was taken by the investigator's site or by a home visit by investig ator's personnel. All cases were adjudicated by an independent committee of clinical experts. The cumulative incidence curves of molecularly confirmed moderate to severe/critical COVID -19 cases (Kaplan Meier) for the placebo and vaccinated groups suggests that the onset of protection is around Day 14 post -vaccination. There were 2 vs. 8 cases of m olecularly confirmed COVID -19 requiring hospitalisation at least 14 days after vaccination in the active vs. placebo group , respectively . The finding was supported by post -hoc analyses which identified 2 vs. 29 cases of all COVID -19 related hospitali sations by implementing a broader search based on all available information (including SAE forms) in the extended data set, i.e. all COVID -19 cases with a positive PCR result, including all cases from a local lab oratory result not yet confirmed by the centr al laboratory at the time of the analysis. In participants 65 years, based on the primary endpoint, efficacy was 82.4% (95% CI: the PP analys is set, 40% of the participants had at least one comorbidity , the most common being obesity (BMI 30 kg/m2, 28%), hypertension (10%) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (7.5%), followed by serious heart conditions (2.5%), HIV infection (2.5%), asthma (1.5%), COPD (1%). It should be noted that only participants with stable condition s were enrolled. Efficacy against molecularly confirmed 'moderate to severe/critical COVID -19' was observed both in participants with and without comorbidities with point estimates respectively of 62.9% and 69.1% for cases with onset at least 14 days after vaccination, and 48.6% and 72.6% for cases with onset at least 28 days after vaccination. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 199/218 Efficacy against molecularly confirmed 'moderate to severe/critical COVID -19' was demonstrated in each participating country. Except for South Africa, all point estimates were >65% for events with onset at least 14 days after vaccination (not computed in Chile and Mexico due to small numbers of cases). In South Africa, vaccine efficacy was of lowe r magnitude compared to other regions/countries (39.6% [95% CI: 8.77; 60.46] for cases days and 57.3% [95% CI: 26.51; 76.03] for cases with onset at least 28 days after vaccination). Heterogeneity across regions was much less marked when considering the PCR positive cases from any source (including those not yet confirmed by the central lab oratory ) (South Africa: 52.0% [95% CI: 30.26; days, 64.0% [95% CI: 41.19; 78.66] for cases with onset at least 28 days after vaccination). Higher vaccine efficacy estimates were determined against severe disease (secondary endpoint) . In the extended data set, when considering cases with onset at least 14 days after vaccination, the VE against severe COVID -19 wa s consistently high, including in South Africa 17.0; 98.0] in Brazil). When evaluated at least 28 days after vaccination, VE point estimates were above 81.7% and comparable between South Africa, the US and Brazil Colombia. The applicant has character ised the virus from 71.7% of the cases and it was found that, for South Africa, 94.5% of the sequences correspond ed to the 20H/501Y.V2 variant (B.1.351 lineage, which shows 9 aminoacid differences and a deletion of two aminoacids in the S protein as compared to the strain included present in the vaccine), in Brazil 69.4% of the sequences corresponded to the variant from the P.2 lineage and 30.6% to the W uhan-Hu1 reference sequence+D614G variant, whereas in the USA 96.4% of the sequences corresponded to the Wuhan- Hu1 reference sequence+D614G. As there were predominant variants in the US A and South Africa, VE in those countries are likely to reflect the efficacy against the respectively circulating variants. These results predict high vaccine efficacy in case the South -African variant 20H/501Y.V2 spreads globally. Ad26.COV2.S elicited both humoral (close to 100% seroconversion) and cellular immune responses in vaccinated subjects, as early as 14 days post -vaccination, in both young and older adults. 3.3. Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects Duration of protection beyond 8 weeks is not known. Efficacy data are not available after this timepoint. L ong-term vaccine efficacy data will become available from post- authorisation effectiveness studies and from the ongoing clinical trials . However, participants in the placebo arm are being unblinded and offered vaccination following the FDA EUA for this vac cine. Therefore, it is unclear whether robust efficacy data can be generated. Preliminary immunogenicity results from the FIH trial demonstrated antibody persistence up to 3 months post- vaccination. Whether antibody titers will persist over a longer period of time is not known. Also, to date, no immunological correlate of protection has been established. Whether efficacy is higher against severe cases compared to all symptomatic cases is not confirmed yet, but there is a trend in that direction. Data sugges t that efficacy point estimates tend to increase with the degree of severity of the case definition. For the severe COVID -19 case definition efficacy was 76.7% and 85.4%, while for the moderate COVID -19 case definition efficacy was 64.8% and 62.0%, respect ively after 14 days and after 28 days. The efficacy was demonstrated in the overall participants aged 18 years and older, and in participants 65 years. However, the number of cases in individuals aged 75 and older at highest risk of severe COVID -19 is limited. No COVID -19 cases were detected in individuals aged 80 years. As baseline Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 200/218 frailty status was not assessed, no information on efficacy data in frail subjects was obtained . Long term health care re sidents were not studied for this application. Efficacy was demonstrated in trial participants with and without comorbidities. Point estimates tend to be lower in participants with comorbidities, but the 95% C Is are overlap ping. When considering efficacy after 28 days , when the numbers of events are the lowest , for the older participants with comorbidities, the lower limit of the 95% CI was <0. For cases with onset at least 28 days post - vaccination, vaccine efficacy was 33.2% (95% CI: - 77.59; ( -85.99; 85.26) for participants 65 years. The 95% CI are very wide as estimates are based on few events. At this stage it is not considered that there is an efficacy concern in individuals with comorbidities. Given the natur e of the comorbidities ( i.e. no immunocompromised participants), there is low biological plausibility for a significantly low efficacy in these study participants. Nevertheless, efficacy by age and comorbidities will need to be assessed over a longer FU ti me to generate more robust estimates. Data are lacking in individuals with uncontrolled underlying disease and in those with several underlying diseases. Efficacy could not be assessed in participants with 3 comorbidities due to the limited number of cas es. There is no data on immunocompromised persons due to condition or immunosuppressive therapies. The applicant is planning an immunogenicity trial in immunocompromised participants as described in the RMP. Considering the lack of an immunological correla tes of protection ( ICP) and the heterogeneous nature of the various types of immune deficiencies, on ly some of which may impact on the immune response to a specific type of vaccine , the applicant is recommended to discuss the study design with competent au thorities prior to study start . Findings related to asymptomatic cases are preliminary since Day 71 samples were available for 6% of the FAS seronegative population. After 28 days post -vaccination, efficacy was 59.7% (95% CI: 32.75; 76.64) for ion -19 based on seroconversion to the SARS- COV-2 N protein and/or on positive PCR. Of the undetected/asymptomatic cases, most of the cases were ascertained based on seroconversion. These preliminary data are promising, as t hey suggest efficacy against asymptomatic SARS -COV-2 infection, at a level that may be consistent with efficacy against symptomatic disease. Preliminary data suggest no impact of vaccination on upper respiratory tract viral load levels and duration of virus shedding in COVID -19 breakthrough cases, but this finding will need to be confirmed when the whole data set will become available . It is not known if the vaccine prevents reinfection in those who are SARS -COV-2 seropositive at baseline, because efficacy could not be estimated as the number of cases was very low. Of 4,156 participants SARS -CoV-2 seropositive at baseline, 7 COVID -19 cases were reported as PCR positive from any source (3 vs. 4 in the active vs. placebo group after Day 14) of which one was confirmed by the central laboratory. However, efficacy is anticipated in this group. The immunogenicity data , albeit limited, support this assumption. Concomitant administration with other vaccines has not been studied. A study evaluating the safe ty and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S co -administrated with seasonal influenza vaccine is planned in the RMP. An analysis of e fficacy per variant was not performed. However, efficacy was demonstrated in South Africa where the South African variant 20H/501Y. V2 was predominant. Efficacy was demonstrated in Brazil, but there was no predominant variant in Brazil. Two third of the cases may be attributable to the P.2 lineage. Spike sequence data were available for only 70% of the cases and a higher proportion of samples were sequenced in the placebo group as compared to the vaccine group, which could lead Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 201/218 to biases. An analysis of vaccine efficacy per SARS -CoV-2 variant is planned upon completion of the sequencing. Preliminary data showed that n eutralising antibodies elicited by Ad26.COV2.S were able to neutral ise the B.1.1.7 lineage variant in vitro, although less efficiently than the reference strain. Thus, some protection against this variant too is anticipated . More data should be generated post -authorisation to continue assessing vaccine efficacy against these variants. The extent and the onset of cross -protection against other relevant circulating or newly emerging strains of SARS -CoV-2 is unknown and should be investigated post -authorisation . Ad26 seroprev alence varies across regions, with higher seroprevalence reported in Africa. In Europe seroprevalence is around 12%. Preliminary results of the COVID -19 program do not indicate a major impact of pre -existing Ad26- nAb on the vaccine -induced SARS -CoV-2 S pro tein binding Ab responses, but this issue needs to be followed up post-authorisation . 3.4. Unfavourable effects The assessment of Ad26.COV2.S safety is based on the Phase 3 study COV3001 (up to the cut -off date of 22 January 2021) , comprising 43,783 participants who received either a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S at 5x1010 vp (21,895 adults) or placebo (21,888 adults) (FAS). Reactogenicity data were collected in a subset of 6,736 participant s who received either vaccine (3,356 adults) or placebo (3,380 adults) (Safety subset). Information on unsolicited AEs was collected for 28 days after vaccination, information on AESIs and SAEs is collected for the entire study duration. At the time of the primary analysis, the median follow -up after vaccination was 58 days in both groups. Any solicited local and systemic AEs were reported more frequently in Ad26.COV2.S than in the control group (66% and 41.9% of evaluated participants respectively , within the first 7 days following injection). The most frequently reported solicited local AE after Ad26.COV2.S vaccination was injection site pain (48.7% vs. 16.7%, respectively). The most frequently reported solicited systemic AEs were headache (39% in Ad26.CO V2.S group vs. 23.8% in the placebo group), fatigue vs. 21.6%, respectively), and myalgia (33.2% vs. 12.8%). Pyrexia was reported in 9.0% participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group (vs. 0.6% of participants in the placebo group). Most solicited AEs were transient and self -timing. Overall, the median duration of the selected solicited AEs was similar in both groups (1 to 2 days after vaccination), and also the median time to onset (within 1 to 3 days after vaccination). Solicited adverse events were mainly grade 1 or 2. The frequency of Grade 3 solicited AEs was low overall, but higher in participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group (2.2%) compared to participants in the placebo group (0.7%). There was no grade 4 solicited AEs. In the safety subset, the frequency of unsolicited AEs reported was low and similar in both (13.1% vs. 12%, respectively). Unsolicited AEs were largely consistent with solicited AEs observed following vaccination, such as headache, fatigue, myalgia, and vaccination site pain. The most frequ ent unsolicited ADRs that were not recorded as solicited AEs were chills, arthralgia, malaise, asthenia, muscular weakness and pain in extremity. Most reported unsolicited AEs were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity. There was a similar frequency of participan ts with unsolicited AEs of at least Grade 3 in both groups. The frequency of unsolicited AEs that were considered related to vaccination was higher in participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group as compared to placebo (7.2% vs. 4.6%, respectively). Up to the cut -off date , in the FAS, the same frequency of subjects reported at least one treatment emergent AESI in both groups (0.6%). Few reported AESIs were assessed as related (0.2% vs. 0.1%, respectively). Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 202/218 Fewer deaths were observed in the Ad26.COV.2.S group (3, none confirmed to be associated with COVID -19) compared to the placebo group (16, including 6 confirmed to be associated with COVID - 19). In the FAS, 0.4% subjects in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 0.6% subjects in the placebo group reported 1 or more non -fatal SAEs. However, a similar frequency of subjects reported SAEs not associated with COVID -19 in both groups (0.4%). Of the 227 SAEs reported, 7 SAEs (reported for 7 participants) in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 3 SAEs (reported for 2 participants) in the placeb o group were considered to be possibly related to the vaccination . The reported SAEs considered related by the investigator for the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine were Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome, pericarditis, brachial radiculitis, post- vaccination syndrome, Type IV hyp ersensitivity and 2 cases of facial paralysis Overall, the safety profile of the vaccine was similar independently of the subgroups. However, reactogenicity was milder and less frequent in older adults aged 65 years compared to the younger adults aged 18 to 64. Higher reactogenicity was reported in females compared to males (although both subgroups had a similar median age). In study COV3001, the most frequently reported 'non -anaphylactic allergic reactions' were rash (24 vs. 16; 10 related vs. 6 related, respectively), urticaria (8 vs. 3; 3 related vs. none, respectively), and hypersensitivity (6 in the vaccine group including 1 related, 4 in the placebo group of which none related). Moreover, since the data lock, a SUSAR was reported which meet the Brigh ton Collaboration case definition criteria for anaphylaxis from an ongoing study in South Africa. Hypersensitivity, rash, urticaria, and anaphylaxis are considered at least possibly causally related to vaccination and have thus been listed as ADRs in the S mPC. Anaphylaxis is also considered as an important identified risk in the RMP. Regarding i mmune -mediated neurological disorders , there was 1 subject with Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome in each group (1 possibly related grade 4 SAE in the Ad26.COV2.S group with a plausible temporal relationship, 1 non -related SAE in placebo group). The risk of Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome is included in the list of AESIs taken in consideration for routine and additional pharmacovigilance activities. There were 3 cases of Bell's palsy ( facial paralysis) in the Ad26.COV2.S group (2 SAE considered as possibly related SAEs by the investigator, but not related by the Sponsor; and 1 non -related AE) compared with 2 cases in the placebo group (non -related). Based on data from reported events, a causal relationship between Ad26.COV2.S vaccination and Bell's palsy could not be confirmed nor ruled out (at least 2 cases possibly related to the vaccine). Bell's palsy is included in the list of AESIs subject to routine and additional pharmacovigilance activities , but not in the SmPC as there is no clear imbalance vs. placebo . A numerical imbalance was observed for the venous thrombotic events with 1 1 subjects in the Ad26.COV2.S group (6 DVT 8 type events , 4 pulmonary embolism, 1 transverse sinus thrombosis; 6 SAEs; 8 events occurred within 28 days following vaccination) vs. 4 in the placebo group (2 DVT events, 1 pulmonary embolism, 1 thrombosed haemorrhoid; 2 SAEs ; all within 28 days of vaccination). Two of these cases were considered related to the study vaccine by the investigator (1 in each group). However, as the majority of the participants had underlying medical conditions (such as obesity, hypothyroidism, diabetes) that could have contributed to the thrombotic and thromboembolic events, the causal relationship between Ad26.COV2.S vaccination and venous thrombotic events was not shown. Venous thromboembolism has been included as an important potential risk in the list of safety concerns of the RMP . Asthma was reported for 7 participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group versus 1 participant in the placebo group , although most were unrelated to study treatment . In the Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal 8 includes one event reported as venous thrombosis limb and one event reported as embolism venous Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 203/218 disorders, 10 subjects reported 10 SAEs in the Ade26.COV 2.S group (3 Pulmonary embolism, 2 Dyspnoea, 2 Hypoxia, 1 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 1 Pleural effusion, 1 Pneumothorax spontaneous) compared to 4 subjects reporting 6 SAEs in the placebo group (Pulmonary embolism, Dyspnoea, Cough, Oropharyngea l pain, Respiratory distress, Respiratory failure). Although the causality is not clear, because there is an imbalance in the number of cases vs. placebo , the risk of exacerbation of chronic pulmonary disorders (i.e. asthma and COPD) might be further monit ored in the planned PASS as an AESI (pending feasibility assessment that will be included in the draft protocol). 3.5. Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects At the time of the primary analysis, the median follow -up after vaccination was 58 days in both groups. Longer safety follow -up of >2 months is available for 23,903 participants in the FAS: 11,948 participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group (54.6%) and 11,955 in the placebo group (54.6%). However, only 34 participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group (0.2%) and 31 in the placebo group (0.1%) have been followed for up to 4 months. Long -term safety data is not yet available and will be characterised as part of the continuation of the pivotal clinical trial, other trials and a PASS. No safety issues were i dentified in vaccinated seropositive subjects, however, due to the limited number of subjects in the safety subset, no definitive conclusions can be drawn (154 in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 147 in the placebo group) . There is no data in immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy, thus the safety of Ad26.COV2.S in these individuals will be evaluated post- authorisation as described in the RMP . There is only very limited clinical experience in pregnant women with Ad26. COV2.S (4 exposed pregnant women). However, there were a significant number of pregnancy cases (1,631) reported for the Ad26 platform safety data (cut -off 21 December 2020; mainly from Ebola vaccine trials N=1,522) of which 280 were exposed during the firs t trimester) . In addition, d ata from non -clinical studies do not indicate any harm during pregnancy. In the absence of clinical data with Ad26.COV2.S to confirm the favourable profile seen with other antigens , risks during pregnancy remain s theoretical. Considering the Ad26 vector is a non -replicating vector, and considering the small amount that is administered intramuscularly, it is deemed unlikely that this vaccine may pose a specific risk during pregnancy, apart from the risk that may be associated with a fever -reaction. Use of Ad26.COV2.S in pregnant women will be investigated in the planned PASS. Although, in COV3001, up to the cut -off date of 31 December 2020, 128 breastfeeding women were enrolled in Ad26.COV2.S group, no data on shedding in breastmi lk was collected during the study. Use in breastfeeding women will be investigated via a PASS . The available data (non -clinical, clinical, neutralising capacity of antibodies) do not raise a concern regarding vaccine -associated -enhanced disease for the tim e being. However, the possibility of enhanced disease cannot be excluded with certainty. The RMP lists VAED (including vaccine -associated enhanced respiratory disease - VAERD) as an important potential risk to be followed up post- authorisation. Co-administ ration with other vaccine s was not studied , but a co -administration study of Ad26.COV 2.S with seasonal influenza vaccine is planned . In the COV3001 FAS, there were 21,895 adults 18 years of age, including 809 adults 75 years of age (3.7%) , of which 495 adults had comorbidities (2.3%), adults with comorbidities (40.8%) , of 2,271 adults were 65 years of age (10.4%). Frailty has not been evaluated yet. Therefore, u se in frail patients with co -morbidities (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmona ry disease COPD, Asses sment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 204/218 diabetes, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders) will be investigated via the ongoing study COV3001 and in the planned PASS. 3.6.

For a full summary of all adverse reactions refer to the Summary of Product Information section 4.8. 3.7. Benefit -risk assessment and discussion 3.7.1. Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects Overall, the efficacy of a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S at a dose level of 5x1010 vp has been demonstrated for the prevention of symptomatic CO VID-19 in adults 18 years of age, as well as an acceptable safety profile, based on the large pivotal phase 3 trial included in this MAA. The results are considered robust based on the study design and are further supported by the different secondary endpoints and analyses. Ad26.COV2.S has been shown to protect against severe disease. Subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint showed efficacy for elderly (65 years), as well as for participants with medical comorbidities associated with high risk of severe COVID -19, which is considered as the population at highest need for preventative strategies. Efficacy against COVID -19 was demonstrated in each participating country, including South Africa (where the variant of concern 20H/501Y.V2 was the predo minant circulating strain during the study), although efficacy was of lower magnitude compared to other region/countries. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 206/218 The main shortcoming of the current efficacy dataset is the unusually short median follow up of approx. 58 days, but longer -term data will be submitted post- authorisation as detailed in the specific obligation and recommendations. More data will be generated post -authorisation to further characterise longer term protection. In the current situation this gap in knowledge is outweighed by urgent need, high COVID -19 disease burden, and limited availability of preventative and therapeutic remedies. It would be desirable to confirm if this vaccine also has an effect on asymptomatic infection and viral transmission . These aspects cannot be eval uated fully based on clinical trials data and will likely be further elucidated through effectiveness studies post -authorisation. The observed safety profile is considered well characterised and acceptable based on the short-term data available . The safety of Ad26.COV2.S is mainly characterised by local and systemic reactions occurring during the first 7 days after vaccination. Reactions were mostly mild to moderate, transient and self -limited. The reactogenicity was milder and lower in older adults aged 6 5 years compared to the younger adults aged 18 to 64. SAEs and AESIs were infrequent in the Ad26.COV2.S and placebo groups. Long term safety has to be characterised further, and it is important to analyse the full year safety follow -up of the ongoing tria ls. The current dataset gives no indication of vaccine -enhanced disease, a potential risk that should be followed up as detailed in the RMP. There is limited clinical experience in pregnant women with Ad26.COV2.S, but a significant experience was accumulated with the Ad26 platform. In addition, preliminary preclinical data are reassuring; therefore, noting that pregnancy as such is a risk factor for severe COVID -19, that pregnant women may additionally belong to other risk groups, and that a protective eff ect is anticipated, vaccination may be considered on a case by case basis. Data in pregnancy will be generated post -authorisation , as detailed in the RMP. Although breastfeeding women were included in the clinical studies with Ad26.COV2.S, there are no dat a available. However b ased on biological plausibility, no risk in vaccinating breast -feeding women is anticipated. Immunocompromised individuals were excluded from the efficacy trial. Some i mmunocompromised individuals may not be protected as well as immunocompetent individuals by vaccination. However, no safety issues are anticipated, and the B/R balance in immunocompromised subjects is deemed positive, also in light of the underlying excess risk of COVID -19. Further data will be collected post - author isation as detailed in the RMP . Also, subjects with severe underlying diseases were not included in the studies, and the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine in these groups will be followed up post - authorisation as detailed in the RMP . Regarding serop ositive subjects, no safety issues have been observed in this population, and efficacy can be anticipated. Therefore, the vaccine can be administered without performing previous SARS - CoV-2 serology testing. 3.7.2. Balance of benefits and risks Given the demonstra ted favourable effect and considering the overall characteristics of the unfavourable effects, a positive B/R balance in the proposed indication is concluded. 3.7.3. Additional considerations on the benefit -risk balance Given the current emergency situation, it is considered that the identified uncertainties could be addressed post -authorisation through specific obligations, including the continuation of the pivotal Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 207/218 clinical study as long as possible, and post -approval effectiveness studies and routine safety surveillance. Conditional marketing authorisation Efficacy, safety and immunogenicity was demonstrated using clinical batches of the vaccine. The active substance and finished product are acceptable in relation to control of critical quality attributes and i mpurities. Studies to demonstrate batch -to-batch consistency of the finished product in terms of process validation studies/process performance qualification studies (PPQ) have not been fully completed in the finished product commercial manufacturing site Catalent Indiana . Nonetheless, sufficient data have been provided for full scale lots (including some PPQ lots) at the commercial sites and at other sites using the commercial process. Considering the above and the current public health emergency, the information provided on the manufacturing of the finished product is considered acceptable. Nevertheless, in order to confirm the consistency of the finished product ma nufacturing process, the applicant should provide the completed process validation ( including hold times) and comparability data for the Catalent Indiana site as a post -approval specific obligation . It is considered likely that the applicant will be able t o provide the requested data and thereby fulfil the specific obligation. Furthermore, the CHMP considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing authorisation: The benefit -risk balance is positive, as discussed. It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data. Based upon the applicant's justification and commitment, detailed plans have been agreed with the applicant and reflected in the quality part of this assessment regarding data to be generated and submitted with interim milestones for assessment by the CHMP in order to complete the proposed specific obligation. Based on the applicant's plans and documentation, it is expected that data to fulfil the quality SO will be submitted grad ually between March and August 2021. Furthermore, the applicant will continue the ongoing pivotal Phase 3 randomised, placebo- controlled study COV3001 to obtain 2- year long -term data and to ensure sufficient follow -up to confirm the efficacy and safety of COVID -19 Vaccine Janssen. The completion of the Phase 3 study COV3001 will lead to comprehensive date on the efficacy and safety of COVID -19 Vaccine Janssen. Unmet medical needs will be addressed, as There is an urgent public health need for rapid development of vaccines to prevent the global burden of disease associated with SARS -CoV-2 infection and COVID -19. Currently there are two mRNA vaccines and a monovalent vaccine composed of chimpanzee adenovirus encoding the SARS CoV -2 spike glycoprotein (ChAdOx1 -S) approved in the EU to prevent COVID -19. Despite the recent granting of a conditional marketing authorisation for Comirnaty, COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna, and COVID -19 vaccine AstraZeneca, there is still an urgent need to provide additional prophylactic options in the context of the pandemic across the EU. The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 208/218 The demonstrated efficacy and the satisfactory safety profile support the immediate availability of the product in the current emergency setting, notwithstanding the outlined uncertainties. 3.8. Conclusions The overall B/R of COVID -19 vaccine Janssen is positive. Eligibility to a conditional marketing authorisation as well as fulfilment of the requirements have been demons trated in line with provisions of Article 14 -a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. 4. Recommendations 4.1. Outcome Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the benefit -risk balance of COVID -19 vaccine Janssen is favourable in the following indication : COVID -19 Vaccine Janssen is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID -19 caused by SARS- CoV-2 in individuals18 years of age and older. The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions: 4.2.

In particular, differences have been noticed for region and ethnicity. In the Ad26 vaccination and placebo groups, respectively 37% and 52.2% of the subjects were from North America, and 26% and 9.5% from West Africa. Moreover, there were 34.8% white subjects in the Ad26 vaccination group and 48.5% in the placebo g roup; and 60.3% black or African American subjects in the Ad26 vaccination group and 46.8% in the placebo group. In further reports, this should be explained and impact on the results should be discussed. Immunity to the vector should be presented across g roups, and any imbalance should be discussed. REC Clinical 43 In the AdVac safety database V5, safety data have been provided irrespective of dose level and per subject (cumulating AE after all doses). In further reports, the applicant is recommended to provide the solicited AEs data for dose level 5x1010 and separately for other dose levels. Data should be presented separately, after dose 1 and after dose 2 (compared to placebo). REC Clinical 44 High differences of frequency of solicited local and systemic AE have been reported depending of the insert. These differences are difficult to interpret given the confounding effect of several factors which could influence reactogenicity. REC Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 217/218 Overall, the frequency of solicited local and systemic AEs tended to be lower in individuals with pre -existing Ad26 VNA positivity at baseline compared those without pre- existing Ad26 VNA positivity at baseline, but again the independent effect of immunity to the vector is unclear. There were also differences in reactogenicity profile across regions and age categories. In further reports, the applicant should list the factors that could influence reactogenicity and provide local and systemic solicited AE stratified for these factors, to allow for a better understa nding of the independent influence of insert, pre- existing immunity to the vector, and other factors on reactogenicity. Clinical 45 The frequency of solicited AE local and systemic is generally much lower in West Africa than in other regions (East and Southern Africa, North America, Europe, and Asia), both for the active and placebo groups. Other differences were noted between African and other regions, such as that in the 3 African regions, no consistent difference between groups was observed as in America, Europe, and Asia. Moreover, in Ad26 individuals, the frequency of severe solicited systemic AEs (all, and related solicited systemic AEs) was lowest in East, West and Southern Africa compared to the other 3 regions. Regional differences in safety were already noted in the Zabdeno EPAR. At that time, the applicant argued that cultural differences may explain the differences in reporting rates of AEs across countries and regions. Discrepancies across regions could also reflect differences in t erms of pre-existing immunity to Ad26 (higher in Africa) and methodological differences between studies. These discrepancies across regions should be discussed in further reports. REC Clinical 46 In the AdVac safety database v5, the applicant stated that \"solicited local and systemic AEs were generally collected from the day of vaccination until 7 days after each vaccination for all populations studied\", and \"unsolicited AEs were collected up to 28- 30 days/4 weeks post - vaccination in most studies\". This s hould be clarified in further reports. If any differences across studies/programmes, they should be REC Assessment report EMA/158424/2021 Page 218/218 described. In addition, the applicant should provide information on the duration of studies. Clinical 47 In the AdVac safety database V5, only limited clinical safety data, and brief conclusions have been given for adults 60 years, based on data from the RSV vaccine clinical development program. In further reports, the applicant is required to provide an adverse events table by age group (less t han 65, between 65- 74, 75- 84 and 85 and above) and to discuss it. REC "}
