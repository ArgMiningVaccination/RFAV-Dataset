When the Tibetan monks create the 7 chakra bowls, the bowl begins as a molten mixture of the special seven sacred metals, gold, silver, iron, mercury, tin, copper and lead. Each of the sacred metals is aligned with the seven heavenly bodies in our solar system and the seven chakras of our body. It takes three to four people to hammer each bowl. One holds the hot metal with blacksmith tongs while two or three others alternate hammering and chanting, infusing the bowl with healing intentions while it is created. The Power of Group Meditation If you are looking for a breakthrough in your personal development, your spiritual journey, your health, and your meditation practice, group meditation is one of the most powerful ways to do that. In a group setting, we tend to go deeper more quickly, and we tend to meditate longer. Also, we literally can meet on the same wavelength: recorded EEG results show that brainwaves synchronize while meditating! Studies have shown that, among other benefits, meditation can help reverse heart disease. It can reduce pain and enhance the body's immune system, enabling it to better fight disease. Group meditation can even lower crime rates (see \"Maharishi effect\"). Meditation also helps people better relate to one another as it can make people less angry, more self-reflective and more loving. The effects are far reaching, life changing, world healing, and consciousness evolving. That is why Unity of Boulder Spiritual Center has been hosting this weekly group meditation since 1978. It is no wonder people say that stepping into Unity's Sanctuary and Meditation Room gives them an instant feeling of peace, balance and harmony. We look forward to meeting you and experiencing oneness, peace and healing together! What a blessing to share the magnificence of the divine in this way. Free Childcare is Provided. "}
