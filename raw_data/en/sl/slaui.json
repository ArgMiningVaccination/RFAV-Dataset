CURRENTLY ON MATERNITY LEAVE - Will return in November, 2023. [ Read More ](#/staff_member/1/bio) Thomas Heikes is passionate in helping guide people to feel connected, healthy, and empowered. He is a Chinese medicine practitioner of acupuncture and is a medical herbalist. Together we resolve obstructions that stagnate the free flow of your vitality by guiding the powerful energies that dance in your acupuncture channels, with the medicine plants that heal our vessels, with the foods of this beautiful planet that nourish life, through lifestyle guidance, education, energy work, and so much more. Health and resilience are experienced when the mind, body, and spirit find harmony and balance. Thomas graduated from a three year Traditional Chinese Medicine program at Pacific Rim College in British Columbia, Canada in 2020; he is a licensed acupuncturist in the state of Idaho; and he is board certified by the NCCAOM (National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine). Thomas has deeply studied Western herbal medicine for many years thorough intensive apprenticeships, many professional courses, and much self exploration, and sharing plant medicine is his true passion. He has also studied Medical Qi Gong, Biodynamic Craniosacral Therapy, and energy work for several years now and enjoys weaving it into treatment as well. What Thomas truly offers is an invitation to stillness, to be fully seen with an open heart in a sacred and safe space. This is an opportunity to feel the winds of change and remember your wholeness, to let go of that which no longer serves your truest expression. Thomas thrives when exploring the depths of life and he shines brightest when sharing with those who welcome journeying into the unknown to reconnect with our wholeness, even if it may be a challenging process. Thomas works with all conditions as a general practice, but is most aligned with those seeking deep healing, to guide a journey into the unknown and see what is inhibiting your fullest expression and together we may meet it, understand and transform it. This includes digestive challenges, mental conditions, energy issues, and everything between. This is the work, the art of living and dying each day, the celebration of life in its entirety. Thomas can often be found outside connecting with plant spirits, and gathering in intentional circle with community. He also love to play (and build) the wooden flute, didjeridoo, and the handpan drum, is an avid gardener, permaculturist, and food enthusiast, among so much more.

And I know exactly what it feels like to struggle with your body's limitations, whether it's dealing with body image issues, living with chronic pain, or simply wanting to be healthy and fit enough to do your favorite activities. Know Yourself, Know Your Body As a professional dancer for nearly a decade, I've spent years pushing my body to the limit and struggling through pain, injury, and the challenges of a stressed and aging body. It took time (and maybe an ego check) for me to develop sustainable movement habits that helped me recover from injury, live pain-free, and maintain a high level of fitness so that I can run a thriving online business and continue to perform. FeelFit You don't have to workout to exhaustion to reach your goals. If I can replace 30+ hours of dancing with three targeted workouts weekly and become stronger, leaner, and more flexible, I know you can experience the results you want too. In the last seven years, I've helped 100s of people benefit from a holistic mind/body approach that rewrites the old fitness story that more and longer workouts are better. Specialties Athletic Conditioning Improve your athletic performance and fine tune your body with workouts that build you up instead of breaking you down. We'll find the perfect exercises to help you stretch, strengthen & condition for your specific performance goals, so you can keep doing what you love; better than ever. Graceful Aging Whether you're 25 or 85, you should spend your days doing what you love. Stay active and healthy as you age with a customized workout plan to safely build strength and flexibility, improve posture and balance, and boost body confidence while relieving daily aches and pains. Chronic Pain Management Rather it's moving without pain, recovering from surgery, managing a chronic health condition, or reducing daily discomfort, we're here to help you learn how to best care for your unique body and minimize pain flare ups while building strength from the ground up. Postpartum Recovery Get your body back. We'll find the perfect exercises to safely rebuild your core and pelvic floor, balance your body, soothe your nervous system, and boost your energy so you can feel like yourself again. FAQ: How does online coaching work? Online sessions are held via Zoom. Your trainer will guide you with a mix of verbal cues and demonstrations so you feel clear on every exercise and don't spend much time looking at the screen. Online sessions are highly effective, with comparable results to in-person, and we've even found most local clients still prefer online sessions for their ease and convenience. Do I need any special machines or equipment? Nope! If you already have workout equipment, such as Therabands or free weights, we may incorporate them into your sessions, but no special machines or equipment are required to get great results. Can I get in person coaching? Where are you located? We're currently seeing in person clients through Shift Medicine in beautiful Moscow, ID. We'd love to see you for an in person session if you're in the area! Just check \"in person\" on your intake form when you book your intro package with us. I don't see a time that works for my schedule. Do you think you can fit me in? Yes! Outside of our listed hours we can often be flexible. Reach out to hello@hannahraetraining.com with your preferred dates and times and we will get back to you within 24 hours. Hi, I'm Hannah Rae.
