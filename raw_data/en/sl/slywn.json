The vision of your school should describe success for students, for the school as a whole, and for any other entities that are critical to your mission. 1) Provide the mission and vision for the proposed school. Mission - The foundation and mission of the proposed Mind Your Books Charter School is to improve the academic achievement of at-risk students, encourage the use of effective and innovative methods of teaching, and provide an accurate measurement of educational achievement. We pioneer a wrap-around model of high-quality educational best practices, and the development of social-emotional wellness strategies in a holistic and therapeutic approach. Vision - Mind Your Books Charter School will provide families with a public-school option yielding private school results through holistic therapeutic services that support social-emotional competence. Through Psychotherapeutic Board approved best practices, students will develop strategies through therapy sessions. They will develop emotional resources so when faced with adversity and strong emotion they have the power to rewrite the moment. Students will balance emotional wellness with a sound academic foundation received at The Mind Your Books Charter School. Balancing the left and right brain; logic and emotion, thereby creating a stabilizing life-force for the student; which levels the playing field in any arena. Our students will be able to lead future endeavors, gain and create access to possibilities and opportunities for life-long achievement in high school, college, and life in general. Vision Explained - Students will be able to academically persevere through the support of their social emotional well-being. Students will receive a solid academic foundation which includes the ability to demonstrate creativity, think critically, collaborate with peers and adults, and communicate effectively, both orally and in writing. Students will develop and learn how to demonstrate social emotional competence through emotional regulation, positive social interactions, rapport, and trust built with LCSW Interns who are earning their college credits through The School of Social Work at UNLV. Our intern therapists will be working with MYBCS students through individual, group, and family therapy right on campus. MYBCS Students will develop their emotional intelligence by building resources on how to overcome adversity through restorative circles led by LCSW Interns. Students will learn how to change their responses to challenges in the moment so they can ensure a positive outcome and reduce suspensions and expulsions by spending time with therapists during in-school suspensions and in moments of heightened aggression and frustration. As students internalize these life-long skills, they will gain access to possibilities and opportunities that will enable them to lead future endeavors while improving the students' long-term quality of life. 2) Briefly describe how the mission and vision statements serve as the foundation for the proposed school, including: a) The students and community to be served: Mind Your Books Charter School (MYBCS) proposes to serve students in grades K-8th grade, here in Las Vegas, NV in the zip code of 89115 starting in the 2024-25 school year. MYBCS will serve students with an effective and innovative approach which provides a rigorous academic experience while supporting the social emotional well-being of all students through quality academic and balancing clinical services. MYBCS believes that all students need to develop the social emotional skills to develop into strong, confident individuals who positively contribute to the community. b) The key components of your educational model: Mind Your Books is a clinic with a school inside. We host a model that reflects the dualities of both sides of the brain in effort to educate and seek emotional balance for our students; holistically. Monitoring of quarterly assessments of academic standards based on a pre-written curriculum calendar that will cover all standards by the end of the school 11year will begin with a pre-assessment. Teachers will grade, discuss, and plan interventions based on this data by using a reflection template to analyze strength, weakness and operation pitfalls of the curriculum before it is officially taught. Midway through each quarter, the standard will be assessed in a short Evidence of Learning assessment. Teachers will once again meet with students and each other to analyze data and ensure that all standards are covered for the proposed quarter before the end of quarter assessment. The purpose of this assessment cycle each quarter will be to measure whether students are on track to meet the standard for all expected learning by the end of the year. If the data shows that students are not meeting the standard, coaching from mentoring teachers and the principal will take place during professional development. Project Based Learning is at the heart of all daily instruction. Within the project-based learning model, we are responsible for ensuring our students learn to the standard necessary to find college and career success. Project Based Learning promotes a love of learning and application of skills taught in real word examples. \"Two major new gold-standard studies conducted by researchers from the University of Southern California and Michigan State University, provide compelling evidence that project-based learning is an effective strategy for all students. outperforming traditional curricula not only for high achieving students, but across grade levels and racial and socioeconomic groups.\"2Students will learn as part of a graduated release model where skills are taught explicitly to students so that they have the tools necessary to show mastery through Project Based Learning culminating activities. As the weeks progress through the quarter, activities and interventions will be tailored to the inquiry aspects of education utilizing the skills taught during the first weeks of the quarter. Near the end of the quarter, teachers will work with the principal to design an assessment that best displays and predicts academic outcomes towards mastery of the state standards. Academic Core Tenets High Academic Standards Standards Based Curriculum and Assessment Calendar Standards-based curriculum is state approved and directed toward mastery of Nevada State Standards. Our education model is focused on the continuous development of our students' skills within the standard of each content area so that our students will eventually prove mastery through project based learning projects. The standards calendar will be developed each summer by the curriculum team. Once standards are planned out, a quarterly assessment cycle will be put in place to ensure the necessary data for interventions are in place. Our drive will be for as many students as possible to meet and exceed mastery of all Nevada State Standards. Data-Driven Instruction Facilitated Through Weekly Data Meetings Data-driven instruction will be the bedrock of maintaining a high academic standard everyday. Teachers and staff will meet weekly to discuss achievement data based on the Standards Based Curriculum and Assessment Calendar. The focus of the meeting will be on either the pre-assessment, evidence of learning (mid semester assessment), or post-assessment. These meetings will be used to provide feedback, plan collaboratively for reteaching of the failed standard, and chart future 2https://www.edutopia.org/article/new-research-makes-powerful-case-pbl 12planning to ensure we are on track to meet all Nevada State Standards by the end of the year. The data from these meetings will be used to inform future assessments as well. Additionally, special education and ESL teachers will use this data to inform future interventions. NWEA MAP will be administered three times a year as a tool to measure growth between quarters and from one year to the next. The Learning Continuum will also be used as an intervention tool for small group instruction and interventions. The Spring to Spring, Fall to Fall, and Winter to Winter Growth Reports will paint a clear picture from an overarching view of exactly how our education programming is doing.Trauma-Informed Instruction Trauma-informed instruction considers how trauma impacts learning and behavior, understanding that trauma can slow down or completely stop the ability to learn; CASEL informed curriculum and DESSA assessments will help us to gauge the well-being of our students. Our teachers will receive professional development from the UNLV during the school year so that they are up to date on the best practices for instructing students that have experienced trauma.Project Based Learning Project Based Learning (PBL) is a teaching method in which students learn by actively engaging in real-world and personally meaningful projects. Each year, we will have an overarching problem that our school community will work together to solve. This overarching school wide project will teach our students and families that we all can have an impact on the world if we work diligently together in collaboration. In year one, we will work to solve world hunger by creating a self sustaining food source within our school. For middle school, they will create an urban farm through a year-long process of various stem projects and assessments. Our students will learn how to grow food indoors using various science inquiry methods. For each quarter, our students will begin with a traditional model of instruction to teach students skills at the standard of the content. Once students have proven mastery, project based learning assignments and projects are given to students to deepen their depth of knowledge. All content subjects will close each quarter with a unit assessment of all content taught that quarter or a culminating project based learning assignment geared towards solving the overall school wide problem of the year.Holistic Instruction Mental Health Assessment CASEL, DESSA, and quarterly student surveys. A comprehensive mental health assessment will involve clinical assessment and information gathering in the following areas: presenting problems, personal history, 13current functioning, relevant cultural issues, previous assessments and interventions, medications, family history, developmental history, substance abuse, suicide risk screening (only when appropriate), and development of Treatment Plan. Parents will be required to attend assessments conducted by therapists in a HIPAA compliant environment when a student is newly diagnosed by the Clinical Director or an MSW. The design of the environment fosters a joy for learning, a sense of connection, a sense of belonging, and a contribution to the whole person. Therapy with UNLV MYBCSS proposes a full-time Clinical Director to oversee the MSWs from UNLV. Therapists are proposed to provide integrated mental health resources to help students overcome academic, behavioral, social, or emotional issues that interfere with success at school, home, and community. Treatment Plans are developed to address these issues. Treatment Plans include behavioral goals and time-bound benchmarks to reflect growth and improvement. We are a contracted learning campus for UNLVs School of Social Work. Restorative Justice In place of excessive suspensions, our plan is to hold restorative circles during in-school suspensions where the students can discuss their \"issues\" and \"violations\" with licensed therapists from our partnership with the UNLV School of Social Work. If an out-of-school suspension is deemed necessary, the student will process through reentry circles with licensed therapists upon return. Along with psychoeducation, students will still be receiving academic work and teacher support during in-school suspensions. Out-of-school suspensions will receive a home visit by a therapist to ensure emotional wellness and connectivity to the school community.Parent-Teacher-Therapist Conference (PTTC) A parent-teacher-therapist conference is a meeting between a student's parents, teacher or teachers, and therapist, to discuss the child's progress academically, socially, and emotionally about ensuring a positive outcome. It will also include a review of the Treatment Plan and the progress toward emotional benchmarks identified or set by the therapist as goals. The teacher is present and reviews with the team and family all academic benchmarks. 14Therapeutic Core Tenants Mental Health Assessment The family decides if they want their student to receive a mental health assessment as recommended by the Clinical Director in a HIPAA compliant environment. Parents are welcome during assessments, and also for family therapyAnnual or biannual formal diagnosis with treatment plan will be written by licensed therapists and interns from the UNLV Psychotherapy program. Interns earn hours on the Mind Your Books Charter School campus by working with our students Therapy Treatment plan goals and objectives are written for social-emotional regulationTherapists data meetings are held with the teachers weekly in order to compare notes regarding social emotional growth and academic achievement through setting frequent goals Psychoeducation (Bibliotherapy) Students are guided toward understanding self and what common symptoms look like in the DSM regarding their diagnosis. Students learn how symptoms show up in their body, mind, and emotions. Students receive 1 hour sessions with licensed therapists using Psychotherapy Board approved mental health curriculum in the form of diagnosis and age appropriate workbooksStudents with an official diagnosis are given child-friendly workbooks about managing the symptomatology of their diagnosis. These therapy based, best practices workbooks can be used by the student in their therapy sessions scheduled into their day. Referenced in a private session with the therapist, the workbooks serve as a Psychotherapy Board approved curriculum to help the student find and maintain their zone of regulation. c) The outcomes and goals you expect to achieve for students and the school overall: Subject 2023-2024 2024-2025 2025-2026 Math Each year, 75% of students will achieve 1.5 years of growth on the NWEA MAP Math targets.Students will achieve 30% proficiency based on the Nevada State Math Tests.Students will achieve 40% proficiency based on the Nevada State Math Tests.Students will achieve 50% proficiency based on the Nevada State Math Tests. ELA Each year, 75% of students will achieve 1.5 years of growth on the NWEA MAP ELA targets.Students will achieve 30% proficiency based on the Nevada State Math Tests.Students will achieve 40% proficiency based on the Nevada State ELA Tests.Students will achieve 50% proficiency based on the Nevada State ELA Tests. Science Each year, 75% of students will achieve 1 year of growth on the NWEA MAP Science targets.Students will achieve 30% proficiency based on the Nevada State Math Tests.Students will achieve 40% proficiency based on the Nevada State Science Tests.Students will achieve 50% proficiency based on the Nevada State Science Tests. 15Goal #1- Academic Growth NWEA MAP Assessment Each year, 75% of students will achieve 1.5 years of growth according to the NWEA MAP data. The reason for the 1.5 year expectation of growth lies in the current state of achievement of students within 89115. If students grow a year and a half in one year, they will be college and career ready academically by the time they have fully matriculated from our school. Achieving growth will mean that educators will receive support and professional development for data use after disaggregation which will be an essential component in ensuring that our expectations of high academic standards are consistently achieved. Intentional planning of interventions for students is a cornerstone. Every Wednesday, during our staff data meetings, the teachers will receive support and will discuss student data based on the most recent assessments both formal and informal. Specifically, the NWEA MAP assessments will allow us to track data Fall to Fall, Winter to Winter, and Spring to Spring to determine the effectiveness of instruction. The interpretation of the data from interim assessments will determine their effectiveness. MTSS (Multi-Tiered Student Supports) is an additional layer of accountability and measure to ensure that we put interventions in place if students are failing to achieve. Tier II supports will center around remediation within the classroom setting. Tier III support will focus on independent practice such as 1:1 with an aide or by working in small groups. Students that remain in Tier III will be a part of the SST (Student Support Team which for us could be a PTTC) for potential further evaluation. The SST/PTTC will also monitor the program to weigh its effectiveness for the individual student regarding academic and SEL goals. Students will have 1:1 conferences with the teacher of each subject that was assessed for the NWEA MAP and will chart their progress in their Student Portfolios.. After an analysis of the zip code of our proposed school, the impact that we would like to have is clear. Most schools are operating below 50% proficiency and are 1 or 2 star schools in 89115. Our opening proficiency goals will be set for 50% on the SBAC, and 75% of our students will meet Spring to Spring Growth targets. We will achieve this growth by using The NWEA Learning Continuum as a source for data to inform whole and small group instruction. We will offer tutoring in after school programs to provide support for students. Goal #2- Social Emotional Competencies UNLV is the backbone of our clinical services which are at no cost to families. The domain of CASEL 5 is reflective of where we will focus emotional wellness competency studies for students. We will assess the students informally and quarterly through CASEL short-form assessments as surveys emailed out to students. Hard copies will be available on campus. The surveys will be electronically returned to the clinical staff for evaluation. The 5 domains of CASEL are self-awareness, self-management ,social awareness, relationship skills, responsible skills, and responsible decision making. These goals are supported daily for all grades (K-8) through the Second Step curriculum taught at Tier 1 as whole school classroom instruction every morning. The UNLV therapist interns will review the CASEL short forms quarterly to create theme-based therapy groups such as depression, grief and loss, and other important topics that balance mental health & wellness for the students that may be revealed in the surveys. We will administer the Devereux Student Strengths Assessment (DESSA) to gather data about the student's emotional state, and will note the findings and observations reported by the members of the PTTC (parent-teacher-therapist-conference) teams. DESSA and CASEL are intertwined, and this is referenced in the image below. The two are not entirely separate. The results for DESSA derive from a norm-referenced behavior rating scale that assesses SEL competencies and provides a score. The analysis of the DESSA report indicates a need for a student to be placed in group, individual, and potentially family therapy sessions. The DESSA score that raises a flag for clinical intervention falls into the following categories: Strength T-score of 60 or above, Typical: T-score of 41-59, Clinical: T-score 40 or below and students scoring in this range would be scheduled to speak with the UNLV clinical team. According to the CASEL meta-analysis, teachers in schools that emphasize the CASEL Framework on their campuses, and as compared to working in schools that did not emphasize SEL, \"93% of teachers want a greater focus on SEL in schools and agree that social and emotional skills are teachable and are calling for schools to prioritize the integration of SEL practices and strategies,\" and, \"56% of educators believe resources to support SEL in the classrooms post-pandemic is critical. 82% agree that a well-crafted fully integrated SEL approach 16makes an impact on academic achievement outcomes.\" The same analysis reports that, \"as of 2021, 62% of parents feel that teaching SEL is important, compared to 55% three years ago.\" Furthermore, \"the benefits of SEL are well researched, with evidence demonstrating that an education that promotes SEL yields positive results for students, adults, and school communities.\"3MYBCS is seeking to host a well-crafted fully integrated SEL approach and will capture the data from the campus in effort to contribute to this culture of calm that benefits the school and the community at-large. Goal #3- Student Self-Regulation Students will be encouraged to reach their full potential through goal setting. They will monitor their own portfolios that will keep them encouraged to improve their scores, grades, attendance, SEL targets, short and long-term academic and emotional goals that will enable them to assess their own strengths and weaknesses. Keeping a snapshot of their own progress teaches students what they have and have not learned. They will be responsible for keeping records of their own skills, attributes, experiences and accomplishments to highlight their own successes, failures, work, values, and achievements. MYBCS seeks to become a school that highly values incentivising growth and progress so the students find value in their effort. \"Students may also create portfolios to compile their best work from a unit or period of time, again allowing them to reflect on the time they've spent learning a particular topic and choosing items they think best showcase how they've put that knowledge to good use.\"4 SEL TIERS The social emotional program will include an approved social emotional curriculum coupled with culturally responsive pedagogy and trauma-informed instruction for K-8 to reduce self-harm, campus violence, and negative behavioral escalation. The focus will be on developing the skills of self-regulation and social emotional competencies rooted in self-awareness and psychoeducation. The Tier I level will include district-approved whole group instruction on social emotional curriculum for each class. At the Tier I level, MYBCS will hold Parent-Teacher Conferences (PTCs) to support the whole child academically, socially, and emotionally. In Tier II and Tier III levels, MYBCS will hold Parent-Teacher-Therapist-Conferences (PTTCs) to support the whole child academically, socially, and emotionally. The Tier II level will include strategic small groups based on assessment results through our Clinical Director, or through the findings of any preexisting Treatment Plan given to the school by the parent or guardian. The groups are also established through the DESSA results that indicate a need for further emotional support. Under the direction of our Clinical Director, 4The Student Portfolio: How to Use This Powerful Tool in Your Classroom | Teach Starter3https://casel.org/fundamentals-of-sel/what-does-the-research-say/ 17who is a fully licensed LCSW, UNLVs Interns will report to the Clinical Director about the treatment course. As stated, the Tier III level will also receive intensive small groups which are based on the DESSA mental health assessment results. Treatment Plans and school based assessment results inform the specific psychoeducation needed to help the student reach therapeutic goals. Students at the Tier III level will also receive specific and individualized psychoeducation through workbooks designed to teach the student about their diagnosis, common symptoms, and how those symptoms affect their body, mind, behaviors, and emotions. The Tier III level will provide individual, group, or family therapy sessions conducted by UNLV LCSW intern therapists under the supervision of our campus based Clinical Director. The Clinical Director works under the direction of UNLVs Director. The goals of school-based therapy will reduce the shameful stigma of counseling, invite a calm and stable culture for the school, develop cooperation and participation of the family, reduce campus violence, suspensions, expulsions, decrease or eliminate returns to juvenile detention, raise self-esteem and self-awareness, and provide therapeutic services in a school community that primarily serves students of color who often do not have access to, nor knowledge of the powerful and positive effects of counseling and therapy. At the Tier II and Tier III level, MYBCS will hold Parent-Teacher-Therapist-Conferences (PTTCs) to support the whole child academically, socially, and emotionally. A parent or guardian may opt their child out of individual therapy, but they will not be able to circumnavigate the interaction with LCSW therapists that are proposed to conduct restorative circles and group sessions with all students involved in escalated behavioral incidents that may require disciplinary action or redirection. The parent/guardian will not be able to opt the student out of interaction with the LCSW therapists if the student is suspended and needs to be reprocessed onto the school campus. Upon return from both in-school and out of school suspensions, students are proposed to matriculate through therapist-led reentry circles to ensure the student returns to school in a balanced, and emotional state. Restorative circles include all involved in effort to rewrite any miscommunications and misunderstandings designed to improve peer-to-peer, and perhaps staff to staff interactions. According to research completed by the NSEA (Nevada State Education Association) a published report titled, \"Addressing the Epidemic of Trauma in Schools Report'' reflects that, \"indeed, once one becomes aware of it, trauma seems to be hiding in plain sight in our schools. From school shootings that shock the nation with grim regularity to the daily toll of violence, poverty, abuse and addiction in our communities that rarely makes headlines, America's students and their families often experience traumatic events that can shape their lives forever. Although there is little reliable data to measure the problem of trauma in our schools, there is a prevailing sense among educators, communicated through their associations, that trauma and trauma-related behavior issues are reaching crisis levels in classrooms across the country.\"5The NSEA also \"believes that supporting students' needs around the issues of trauma will enable them to come to school ready to learn and meet academic challenges that reinforce the development of life skills, mental stimulation, and student learning. When schools become trauma sensitive, they strive to ensure that all students are receiving the support they need to succeed.\"6MYBCS shares in the overarching mission and vision of the NSEA. d) Key supporters, partners, or resources that will contribute to the school's success: An important partner that will contribute to the success of the proposed MYBCS includes the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) School of Social Work. The University will provide Social Worker Interns to work under the direction of the University to provide free therapeutic services for students and families. The Proposed MYBCS would be a learning campus for UNLVs interns who are earning their service hours. Additionally, the local community has provided a few key supporters, partners, and resources, such as STEMfinity, First Nevada Robotics, Mathnasium, Discovery Children's Museum, Three Square Foods, SYSCO, and The Center for the specific needs of the LGBTQIA+ community. 3)Identify the statutory purpose(s) 4F7that the school will fulfill and explain the alignment to the school's mission and vision.(The six statutory purposes are: a) Improving the academic achievement of pupils, b) Encouraging the use of effective and innovative methods of teaching, c) Providing an accurate measurement of the educational 7NRS 388A.246(2)6Trauma-Informed Schools | Nevada State Education Association (nsea-nv.org)5Addressing the Epidemic of Trauma in Schools - NCSEA and NEA Report.pdf 18achievement of pupils, d) Establishing accountability and transparency of public schools, e) Providing a method for public schools to measure achievement based upon the performance of the schools, and f) Creating new professional opportunities for teachers.) MYBCS' stated purpose identified in the mission and vision as well as throughout the application that align with the statutory purposes of NRS 388A.246 are as follows: The six statutory purposes are: (a) Improving the academic achievement of pupils: Rigorous academic achievement is the primary focus of the school and supports the MYBCS' vision and mission to educate through a strong academic foundation which will yield extraordinary patterns of growth year-over-year, offer superior rates of proficiency, and academic preparation for college or the ability to earn a high-value career credential. All students will be educated through Nevada's Academic standards-based curriculum which is guided by benchmarks and frameworks. Effective instructional strategies include culturally responsive pedagogy. Teachers will receive professional development frequently to deliver trauma-informed instruction. Data-driven instruction will ensure that students have opportunities to excel. The goal is for MYBCS to achieve a minimum of a 4-star rating within the charter term. (b) Encouraging the use of effective and innovative methods of teaching: The most effective and innovative methods of teaching, especially for the educationally disadvantaged, and students of color is culturally responsive pedagogy and trauma-informed instruction. The Clinical Model is rooted in social-emotional competencies such as a growth mindset, intellectual curiosity, perseverance, self-efficacy, self-regulation, and social awareness. The teachers will be professionally developed to learn how to work within the duality of mental health and academia, and how to recognize the base needs of a student who may have experienced trauma. When teachers recognize the impact of trauma, and can understand the symptoms, they are better able to develop meaningful relationships with students who can now learn in the least restrictive environment. Furthermore, the focus on trauma informed instruction will ensure that no students fall through the cracks and that growth occurs to close the achievement gap. (c) Providing an accurate measurement of the educational achievement of pupils: By administering frequent formative and summative assessments using curriculum-based measurements, through teacher observation, Northwest Evaluation Association (NWEA), Measure of Academic Progress (MAP), World-Class Instructional Design and Assessment (WIDA), Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (SBAC), and iReady, MYBCS will assess formally and informally as the foundations upon which teachers will drive instruction through data analysis. (d) Establishing accountability and transparency of public schools: The results of the formative, summative, and observational assessments will be presented to the Board quarterly to ensure that the Board can make informed decisions about the use of human and fiscal resources. These strategies establish accountability and transparency of public schools because these presentations will take place during open and public board meetings. Parents will have the opportunity to participate in all board meetings. All school documents including academic reports, financial reports, policies, and procedures are public records which can be reviewed to ensure that the MYBCS is spending taxpayer money efficiently, legally, and ethically. (e) Providing a method for public schools to measure achievement based upon the performance of the schools: MYBCS is potentially seeking to serve students in or near the 89130-zip code in a public charter school. We wish to develop healthy relationships with the other public schools in the area. Charter Schools are schools of choice, and parents have the right to choose the school that will provide the best education for their child. We offer a unique clinical program that other schools do not offer. We have a unique program that will benefit the community with free education and clinical care. 19(f) Creating new professional opportunities for teachers. MYBCS' teachers will have a variety of new professional opportunities. All teachers will receive professional development on the curriculum, SIS Infinite Campus, PBL from the Buck Institute, CASEL competencies through the Second Step curriculum and UNLV School of Social Work, data analysis and data-driven instruction, culturally responsive pedagogy, trauma-informed instruction, parents as partners, and the therapeutic model that ties into our discipline and restorative justice components. 2.2 TARGETED PLAN 1) Building on the school's mission and vision, describe the community that the school plans to serve, including the intended student population and the educational options currently available. The foundation and mission of the proposed Mind Your Books Charter School is to improve the academic achievement of at-risk students, encourage the use of effective and innovative methods of teaching, and provide an accurate measurement of educational achievement. We pioneer a wrap-around model of high-quality educational best practices, and the development of social-emotional wellness strategies in a holistic and therapeutic approach. The mission of our charter school is in direct alignment with the greatest need of our chosen community. According to CDC data, our youth everywhere need to balance emotional wellness before they can excel academically and socially. 89115 has a high number of citizens that are in need of social-emotional and academic support. By focusing on high academic expectations while ensuring that any student and their family who may need mental health services can receive it immediately within the school day will offer an advantage because we will not need to send students out of our building for that care. 89115 struggles academically. Most schools within our zipcode operate with students testing at about 15-25% proficiency. Students in the 89115 zip code that are below grade level will only fall further behind each year that they do not achieve proficiency. Students will have their assignments and goals tracked each week to check for completion and performance. Students that have more than one F will have an opportunity for remediation and practice as part of our after school program. Parents will receive a weekly report of academic performance generated through Infinite Campus. 2) Provide a brief executive summary of your educational model and how it meets the needs of the community you wish to serve. MYBCS has worked with the families and community members through various parent meetings and community events in order to prepare this application to meet the needs of students in the 89115 zip code and its surrounding area zip codes to include 89030, 89101, 89104, 89110, 89121, 89142, 89156. A brief summary of our model is that it is a Clinical Model to address the emotional urgencies of the hour. MYBCS is clinically based coupled with academic best practices. The clinical base of the MYBCS model addresses the mental health disparity felt all around the country, and according to the CDC, they support and study SSE (school support environments) and have reported that \"what works in schools is an approach to school based health that has been shown to improve health behaviors and experiences, support mental health and reduce suicidality in schools that implement mental health programs. These programs work by: 1) improving mental health education, 2) connecting young people to the services that they need, and 3) by making school environments safer and more supportive.\" 89115 is a low income area with a high FRL rate of 100%, and also according to the CDC, \"8.7% of people who have incomes below the poverty level report severe psychological distress,\"8 and that \"poverty causes stressors such as insecurity and uncertainty about food, housing, and income. Low income communities tend to have limited resources, poor houses, high crime and violence rates, and an inadequate school system, which are all associated with poor mental health outcomes.\"9MYBCS seeks to offset some of the community disparity by providing a strong academic foundation as well as professional support with mental health disparities through UNLV that may include the entire family at no cost to them. 9https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/whatworks/index.html8Low-Income Communities | Anxiety and Depression Association of America, ADAA 20The feedback from the community over the years was that students need rigorous academics and support for their social emotional well-being. The focus on social emotional well-being through social emotional curriculum, culturally responsive pedagogy, trauma-informed instruction, frequent assessments, and site-based therapy came from feedback received from our stakeholders in our pre-existing community model as a 501 C3 non-profit organization. The population of the 89115-zip code is roughly 70,080 residents with a median household income of less than $45,000 which will identify most students as socioeconomically disadvantaged. Nearly 30% of the families are headed by a single parent and over half of the total population are households with school-aged children. Nearly all the working residents have a daily commute from 20-40 minutes per day. The educational attainment level for persons 25 years or older is very low. The percentage of people who did not graduate high school is among the highest in the nation at 34.2%. The percentage of people who only graduated from high school is 49.9%. The percentage of people who have an Associate's degree is 4.8%, a Bachelor's degree is 6.8%, and a Master's degree is 3.1%. The educational attainment level is important because it translates into blue collar workers earning low wages. Based on the current demographics in the area and the surrounding schools, MYBCS anticipates that the student ethnic breakdown will be about 59% Latino, 21% Black or African American, 8% white, 10% of students who represent Two or More Races, and 2% other. MYBCS anticipates that the students with disabilities will be about 15%, the students who are English Learners will be 35%, and 100% of the students will qualify for free and reduced lunch because they are socioeconomically disadvantaged. This was determined by an average representation of the elementary and middle schools in the 89115 zip code. 213) Describe how the proposal meets at least one of, and preferably multiple, academic, or demographic needs identified in the SPCSA's Academic and Demographic Needs Assessment10: 1) Demographic Need, 2a) Academic Need: Geographies with 1- and 2-star schools that continue to have an index score below 50, and/or 2b) Academic Need: Students at risk of dropping out of school. For details on the identified needs, refer to the SPCSA's Academic and Demographic Needs Assessment. Academic Need: Geographies with 1- and 2-star schools that continue to have an index score below 50: According to the data from the 89115 zip-code, the demographic need addressed herein is, for one, an academic need within the geographical location of the surrounding schools that continue to have an index of score below 50, and whose schools also host 1 and 2 star ratings. (See table above) This gives MYBCS an opportunity to contribute to quality education and quality schools in the zip code. 2.3 Parent and Community Involvement 1) Describe the Committee to Form or CMO's ties to and/or knowledge of the target community. We have two committee members, Ema Rowe and Ron'nika Oliver that are parents and residents of the 89115 community and are stakeholders of 89115. Our committee members harvest a wide range of expertise in various fields of business and education such as Dr. James Harden, Stuart Elzy, Sharon Szeman and Cami Taiwo. Dr. Harden is a legal analyst and has a law enforcement background as a police officer and as DEA, as a legal investor for the United States Military, and as Director of Human Resources. For the integrity of the Clinical Model, we have two members with long standing clinical careers; Sharon Szeman RN, and Bruce Mufson, LCSW. As previously stated, we have three Committee to Form members that are awaiting the enrollment of their children into the proposed MYBCS, and two who have pre-existing ties to the community in business and as residents. These committee members have been integral in the development of community relationships within 89115 by introducing MYBCS to key community stakeholders. Some, but not all of the committee may become the Board of Directors for MYBCS. The 89115 community exhibits identical overarching needs that we profess as goals, mission, and vision for attention to mental health, community resources, and better school options. 2) Describe the role to date of parents and community members in the development of this application. What specific strategies have been implemented to engage parents and community members? Provide specific examples of how input from parents, neighborhood and community members has impacted the application. To engage the families, MYBCS has held Zoom Q&A's and attended festivities as vendors to gather the opinions of the families, to garner support, and to share the mission and vision of the school. These parents have signed their children up as potential enrollment interests. These vendor's events in the community have been hosted by the parents who have signed the interest to enroll forms. Some of the parents serve their community in various ways and introduce us to the community nonprofits and have hosted food and clothing drives where we come out and meet people to hear their ideas. The MYBCS will host an arts & crafts festival on Friday, June 23, 2023 in 89115 to sign up more families and meet the people. We have gone door-to-door and distributed flyers in the 89115 apartment complexes. For the interested persons on the sign up sheets, we will host subsequent Q&A events to find out which programs parents would like to see on the campus grounds such as sports, clubs, or events. 3) Describe how you would continue to engage parents, neighborhood and community members from the time the application is approved through the opening of the school and once the school is operating. What specific strategies would you rely on to establish buy-in and to understand and respond to parent priorities and concerns during the transition process and post opening? 10NRS 388A.220(6) andNRS 388A.249 22MYBCS will continue to practice a variety of approaches to engage parents and have a presence in the community before the school is open. Even a period following the application's submission but preceding its authorization, the Proposed MYBCS will continue to take specific steps to engage parents, businesses, neighborhoods, and community members. To encourage buy-in, we have spoken to the kids in the middle of the sidewalk to ask them what they want in school, we have gone door-to-door and distributed flyers in the 89115 apartment complexes. We walked and talked with people. For the interested persons on the sign up sheets, we will host subsequent Q&A events to find what the parents would like to see on the campus grounds such as sports, clubs, or events. We want to know how the parents choose to intersect with the MYBCS campus life so that we can develop their ideas into inclusive programs that will benefit their children. Some fathers have asked to coach and build sports teams over the summers preceding opening. The greatest sports interest among the children was for football, basketball, and dance troops for the girls. We have participated in table events as vendors at community fairs and concerts to promote the school and talk to parents that have signed the interest of enrollment form. We have a translator on the committee; Ema Rowe, who translates English into Spanish in order to engage Spanish-speaking families who may need translation. This engenders buy-in because the families are seeing their desires toward their children become manifested in quality programs that they can participate in. We would continue to engage parents during the incubation year and after approval. MYBCS designed a website at inception as a non-profit 501 c3 in 2018, and continues to evolve to bring the community current and up to date information relating to the creation of the school, values, enrollment, resources and links to MYBCS' social media accounts. The website offers links to a chat option with document upload, a blog, a Facebook page, an Instagram account, Podcasts, an NWEA test practice link, and a YouTube Channel that hosts professional development information for educators, as well as district-approved K-12 Science videos for student use on hundreds of standards-aligned Science topics accessible for free to the public, and for classroom use. The website is designed to inform parents and families in the community of the work and value that Mind Your Books has already brought to the community of Southern Nevada including its mission, vision, diversity, and inclusion statements. In addition, MYBCS will continue to nurture its community partnerships such as Nevada Partners who assist families with finding housing programs, career training and development options, GED support, job preparedness, financial coaching, and credit counseling. We intend to duplicate community engagement during the incubation period. Other meetings are currently being negotiated that will be open to all in the community who may wish to receive information. We are still nurturing partnerships in the business community of 89115 and will continue to do so during incubation in Year 0, and post-opening. 4) What programs, activities, and procedures will be implemented to encourage the participation of all parents, including parents of students with disabilities and English language learners? We want to continue to establish relationships with families prior to the opening of the school. W e walk ed the s tr eets of 8 9 1 1 5 , and s pok e t o many of the families with childr en. T he childr en ex pr es s ed an inter es t in s por ts ; namely football and basketball. Some of the parents expressed interest in coaching and refereeing the teams. This is a great buy-in for the children to participate in building teams in the summertime so that they can continue to enjoy the teams at the campus. We want to hold classes that host diabetes education awareness, food drives, adult education support courses, and resume building seminars for job readiness for parents. MYBCS already offers a host of community resources such as gently used clothing for women which may help them prepare for job interviews. Students with disabilities are welcome as well because all activities and festivities are accommodating to disabled persons, and for ELL, we have translators at all events. We informed the families of our plan to continue to engage them in after school support programs such as tutoring, and such as Family math night and math games, STEM clubs, robotics clubs, video gaming nights, field trips, Robotics competitions, ESL classes for ELL student's families, and UNLV's parent training on coping with and helping to navigate their child's diagnostic symptoms. During these events there may be opportunities for parent volunteering, but it is not required. 235) Describe any opportunities for parent volunteer activities as well as any policies related to parent volunteering. MYBCS recognizes the role parents play in the education of their children, however in lieu of safety, we will host a closed campus to the public and will discourage families in the hallways and classrooms of the school campus during school hours, and will meet with parents by appointment, open houses, festivities, field trips, conferences, and assemblies. We prioritize campus safety. To develop a culture of parent engagement, MYBCS will encourage parents to participate in the family therapy sessions, encourage parents to attend PTCs and PTTCs, join or suggest charter school committees and events, and to also attend Board meetings and raise their voices with questions, comments, suggestions, and concerns. MYBCS shall not require a parent of a prospective or enrolled student to perform volunteer service hours, nor make payment of fees or other monies, goods, or services as a condition of their child's admission, continued enrollment, attendance, or participation in the school's educational activities. Parents will become more aware of the school's culture, communicate with school administration, teachers, and staff, distinguish opportunities to support their children, and potentially discover additional ways that they may help the school in the safest way possible. MYBCS will engage parents, teachers, and community leaders to meet on a periodic basis to advise on the operations and programs of MYBCS with the purpose of increasing student achievement, community connection, and to foster an environment of belonging to a greater learning community. These opportunities will include, though not be limited to the following: Parent Advisory Council: four (4) member parents, two (2) member teachers, two (2) staff members and the Executive Director. The Parent Advisory Council may develop, plan, approve required policies, plans for the Charter School, and advise on the use of restricted funds. Monthly, parent workshops presented by the Executive Director, Clinical Director, Social Work Interns, Teachers, Paraprofessionals, or other Parents. Topics may include Diabetes wellness care, Parenting for Success with a child with a diagnosis through UNLV workshops, importance of attendance, recognizing trauma, how to prepare for Parent Teacher Conferences and Parent Teacher therapist Conferences, and GED support program to name a few. Monthly events for families to gather to celebrate their children and the education the students are receiving. Topics may include for example Donuts with Dads, Muffins with Moms, Literacy Nights, Open House, Math Nights, Game Nights, and Arts and Crafts nights, and Movie Nights. Community Sports led by parents Email newsletters: These will go out monthly informing parents, families, and community of the latest 6) Complete the table (duplicate as needed) below for EACH strategic partnership your school has established with community organizations, businesses, or other educational institutions (do not include the CMO/EMO identified, dual-credit partners discussed in subsequent sections, or proposed vendors). Provide, as Attachment 3, existing evidence of support from each of the community partners identified such as letters of intent/commitment, memoranda of understanding, and/or contracts. Although the SPCSA welcomes general letters of support for the proposed charter school, this section seeks information regarding specific partnerships with community partners and specific information regarding community partner's commitments to the proposed charter school. Please refer to the rubric for additional details. 24Partner Name First Nevada Robotics Briefly describe this partnership Robotics and STEM Specify the nature, purposes, terms, and scope of services of any such partnerships, including any fee-based or in-kind commitments from community organizations or individuals that will enrich student-learning opportunitiesThe nature of this partnership is to provide engineering programs through school level teams and competitions, and to support PBL.

Provide families with high quality schools. The SPCSA aims for a majority of schools to be rated as 4- or 5-stars. 2. Ensure that every SPCSA student succeeds - including those from historically underserved student groups. The SPCSA aims for all sponsored schools to demonstrate strong academic growth, high levels of proficiency and on-time graduation across all student groups, including historically underserved student groups. 1) How will you ensure that your school earns, or is on track to earn, a 4- or 5-star rating by the end of your first charter term? MYBCS will seek to achieve 70 points or greater on the NSPF Framework in order to meet standards by assessing and studying data to observe trends and patterns in student and school wide achievement. Mastery of the standards will be measured through inquiry-based direct instruction, PBL projects such as STEM, robotics, and assessments. Each quarter will begin with a review and pretest. Direct inquiry based instruction will dive to the heart of the standards set in the pacing guide and teachers will be supported through PD and staff meetings to support them in gathering resources for student interventions based on data from iReady and NWEA. This ensures that we have enough data to plan interventions for each student through small group instruction. College and career readiness is an indicator to measure tracking for college and career readiness. The two most important growth assessments will be the Fall to Fall and Spring to Spring administrations of the NWEA MAP results to give us a schoolwide snapshot of where to focus interventions. SBAC will predict the annual performance of our students and will be especially useful in year 2 and beyond for data analysis and planning. Our model is proactive in maintaining an emotionally safe environment for our students. Students below grade level will be retaught in small groups in effort to close the achievement gap. Incentives, awards and recognition for meeting and exceeding growth targets will take place every quarter to inspire our students to become pursuant of self-determined goals both academically and socially. 2) How will you drive growth among students at all achievement levels, accelerating the levels of proficiency and on-time graduation of those who are most behind? Students at all levels will be encouraged in self-regulation through growth portfolios to include quarterly interim assessments, NWEA MAP percentile data, DESSA results, formal and informal classroom assessments, SEL goals, and grades. UNLV will be at the center of providing both therapy to students and training of teachers to earmark social competencies. Students will have an aide or a sub present or a UNLV teacher intern working in small groups or 1:1 interventions. \"Project based learning is a teaching method where students gain and apply skills by working on a long project where they complete an in-depth inquiry into a topic or question and is not a standalone. It can be added to the teaching already being done in the classroom. PBL allows for more real-world application and in-depth understanding of the concepts that students need to understand.\"11We will seek to align and meet the SPCSA's strategic goals to provide families with 4 or 5 star schools and to ensure that every SPCSA student succeeds. The elementary and middle schools within the 89115 zip code are 1 to 2 star schools with low star and proficiency ratings. Every Wednesday after early dismissal, we will host a data meeting, professional development, or staff meeting for our teachers. This will serve as an intentional space to make improvements in instructional design and in the general operations and culture of our school. Students will be released early on these meeting days. Teachers will plan groups using The Learning Continuum from NWEA for grouping of standards aligned support. 11The Benefits of Project-Based Learning (and Why It Should Rule YOUR School!) - Performing in Education 273) Describe the distinguishing features of your school, including programmatic components that make your school unique. For each feature, describe how it will be implemented. Key features may include: Note that this question is aimed at understanding what makes your school unique, how those features are implemented, and how they fit together. If a key feature is described in another portion of the application, you may reference that section rather than repeating information and focus your response to this question on implementation of the key feature. MYBCS is a school that offers therapy. This is currently being done all over the country and in every school. What makes us distinguished is the consistency of the therapy model that intertwines with the daily schedule for the wellness of all students who may need stronger emotional support, or who may have treatment plans. a) Programs (e.g., curriculum, professional development, after school program, parent program, etc.), Our K-8 SEL curriculum that hosts full class blocks with curriculum and PD, an account with New Harbinger for psychotherapy workbooks, internal and external professional development for curriculum and psychotherapy training through UNLV. After school programs include engineering through robotics, coding, science club, math camps, parent-led flag football (interest), diabetes and job readiness programs, GED programs, clothing scarcity and free 30 day RTC bus pass support for parents. b) Principles (e.g., restorative practices, individualized learning, learn at your own pace, etc.), and Our restorative practices are deeply rooted in clinical service and case management through our Clinical Director and through UNLV and is spelled out in our discipline policy. Individualized learning is correlated to the staff support of data analysis and disaggregation of the data to inform interventions and to plan for small group instruction. PBL enhances the learning experience. Individualized learning is supported through the use of student portfolios. c) Structures (e.g., blended learning, small learning communities, small class sizes, etc.). Our structure is a Clinical Model; and a school with a clinic inside where students can learn in a non traditional setting of comfort and calm. We expect to grow quickly due to the necessity of the model, but to begin we wish to host small class sizes of 20 students per class. We will use data specific to student groupings. The data collected reflecting the school climate will be pertinent to the decisions that will be made for overall school improvement efforts. 4) Explain how these key features will influence student success. Cite evidence from your own experience, valid research, and/or provide a well-defined logic model and plans for studying the effectiveness. The clinical design of the school is a key feature of the school that will influence student success by balancing the mind. The assessments in the fall of each year will provide an academic baseline. Interim assessments both formal and informal will track student achievement of standards and we will check student learning from quarter to quarter, week to week, and assessment to assessment. We will be intentional with the data because we know that if the clinical data is qualitatively positive, then the quantitative aspects of learning will be much easier to achieve. The CDC is collecting data in support of therapy in school. According to the CDCs (SSE) Safe and supportive environments in support of therapy at school, \"Studies show that protective factors like providing SSE can reduce health risk behaviors related to HIV and STDs in adolescents, such as, encouraging condom use and delaying sexual initiation, as well as lowering the likelihood of substance use, violence, suicidal thoughts or attempts, and pregnancy. Adolescent connections to family and school during middle school and high school are also related to numerous positive outcomes in adulthood, including: Fewer sexual partners and STI diagnoses. Reduced emotional distress and suicidal ideation. Lower likelihood of being a victim of or committing violence. 28Less prescription drug use. Higher likelihood of attending and graduating from college.\"12 5) Are there any portions of an existing school model that you will utilize in this proposed school? If so, identify the school and describe the student performance results driven by that model. In our research, we found and studied schools in New York and Pennsylvania that incorporate the same pillar tenant of SEL. Even on the opposite end of the country and in the South, the recognition that SEL is critical to all children is even more apparent than pre-pandemic. At Evergreen Charter School, social emotional wellness is aligned with the CASEL Framework. Some of their overarching precepts are to promote social and emotional development, to develop problem solving strategies, and work cooperatively to solve problems. They have grade level SEL activities embedded in their school day. Where MYBCS is unique and set apart is that we are working with therapists to address deeper underlying trauma which would be revealed in the DESSA assessment. Wissahickon Charter School has a 71% math proficiency and a 84% reading proficiency rate in correlation to the social emotional wellness of their students.13We know that through our own community work that balancing the emotions yields a greater academic outcome when there is teacher/therapist collaboration. 3.2 CURRICULUM AND INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN The proposed framework for instructional design must both reflect the needs of the anticipated population and ensure all students will meet or exceed the expectations of the Nevada Academic Content Standards. 1) Provide a description of the proposed instructional design of the school and the type of learning environment the school will provide. Include the planned class size and structure, and the teaching methods that will be used. The primary focus is to provide effective and innovative instruction. The focus will be on providing high-quality, data-driven instruction through Project-Based Learning (PBL). The students will be frequently assessed both formatively and summatively, and the teachers will work collaboratively to analyze the data and develop lesson plans and activities to specifically teach the prerequisite skills students need to master standards. The students will be grouped to ensure mastery and the instruction will be differentiated. An important pillar inclusive to our educational model is the provision of mental health services and standards aligned curriculum. In the 89115 community there is limited access to cohesive mental health services. Second Step (K-8) Aside from available campus therapy, the Committee chose Second Step; a CASEL incorporated, district approved K-8 SEL curriculum for daily instruction and support. In this environment, MYBCS students will learn that they have value, practice self-reflection, participate in therapy and social emotional activities. In turn, a reduction in the shameful stigma of social emotional support and mental health services can be seen with new optimism. MYBCS believes that the community will best be served by providing social emotional resources and instruction, coupled with standards-aligned academia which supports the bedrock of successful academics. These approaches will increase scores, reduce student discipline referrals, violence, and aggression thereby developing a safe, positive, affirming school culture. Second Step provides a full Social Emotional curriculum for each grade level and is replete with activities, Powerpoints, games, and parent information in English and Spanish. English Language Arts The English Language Arts program has various components known to be effective and enriching in this area. These formats are aligned with the Nevada Academic Content Standards and aligns with Common Core and includes the components of the language arts program and will be integrated throughout the week in the following formats: ELA matters across all subjects. Foundation reading is paramount to long term success. Words matter and we 13Wissahickon School District Test Scores and Academics - Niche12What Works: Safe and Supportive School Environments | DASH | CDC 29must ensure students master vocabulary. We must be intentional in the structure and practice of how we teach students how to read. ESL is not a barrier to becoming an amazing reader. Mathematics All students will be engaged in challenging, hands-on math activities. Developing mathematical understanding and skills are crucial to academic success. The curriculum builds upon the standards set forth by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. These formats are aligned with the Nevada Academic Content Standards and align with Common Core. Success in mathematics is an indicator of long term problem solving success. A standard has not been mastered unless it has reached the conceptual understanding of it. Math is best learned when it is modeled with student participation and bursts of independent practice. The math we chose will prepare our students for success beyond our school. Science MYBCS' science program is based on inquiry-based science instruction that aligns to both Common Core and the Next Generation Science Standards. Science will be the backbone of our STEM project based learning program. Students learn best through inquiry based science labs and experiences. 100% of students will participate in the school science fair. Social Studies Social Studies is an extension of ELA. Students that can think critically through historic events will also think critically throughout life. All history is history. STEMScience Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) is a powerful course that can be used to supplement lessons, implement activities and bring content material to life. MYBCS' primary goals are to develop strong oral and written communication, and educate global citizens who can speak and engage confidently with others. STEM is used to enhance the achievement of these goals. Clinical & Mental Health Workbooks Also called \"bibliotherapy,\" The rationale for the choice in the mental health workbooks listed above is that they provide activities that are DSM-V and Psychotherapy Board Approved specific to a diagnosis or a state of being. They were selected by the proposed Clinical Director who is a fully licensed LCSW. Bruce Mufson, LCSW has 26 years' experience as a licensed LCSW and serves here in Las Vegas currently as a social worker in private practice. These workbooks will be used in individual and group settings with students and UNLV therapists. These books also align with the CASEL Framework's 5 domains: Self-Awareness, Self-Management, Social Awareness, Relationship Skills, Social Awareness, Responsible Decision Making. \"In February 2023, the CDC reported that 60% of teen girls feel persistent hopelessness and sadness, and that 25% of these girls have an actual suicide plan. They go on to report that \"depression is hitting teen boys, too. Overall, more than 40% of teens said they felt so sad or hopeless within the past year that they were unable to do their regular activities, such as schoolwork or sports for at least two weeks. The LGBTQ+ community reported high depression rates, too. 52% of teens who identify as LGBTQ+ said they struggle with mental health because of stigma and violence toward them.\"14When having group discussions with the MYBCS clinical team in SEL groups, the use of these books are a good barometer to see how students are feeling both emotionally and mentally. By recording responses in the book, it gives students a chance to be anonymous in describing their feelings because they may be uncomfortable speaking aloud in the group setting. For the clinician reading the responses in the book, it can give them an understanding that something is wrong and that deeper clinical services may be required. Whatever is revealed in the workbooks, care would be taken, and the information would not be used as a punitive measure, but to create a bridge so that the student can find comfort with whatever is going on in their world. The rationale of these workbooks is to structure the responses of the anxieties that youth have experienced exponentially since COVID lockdowns. There has been a surge in suicidal ideation, anxiety, depression, and ongoing panic attacks in young people. The use of these books will be helpful as an outlier to capture the feelings and emotions. The goal is to be able to control the symptoms before they become too severe for the student to control on their own. The psychoeducation that they will receive through the MYCBS/UNLV clinical services will help to reduce self-harm, hospitalizations, violence, and self-destructive actions such as cutting and drug and alcohol usage 14https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/2023/increased-sadness-and-violence-press-release.html 302) Using the table below, provide a comprehensive list of the school's curricula for core academic subjects 6F15: English Language Arts, Math, Science, and Social Studies, and describe how these curricula align to Nevada Academic Content Standards 7F16.Add rows as needed until the table reflects all grade levels and subjects. Mind Your Books has an established account with McGraw Hill. After we researched options, McGraw Hill seemed fitting for the 89115 student population because it aims for the middle kids (bubble kids) with room to differentiate in any direction. All of the curriculum that we chose is not too simplified nor too difficult and can support accelerated enrichment and remediation of failing and struggling students as well as resources for differentiation. All curriculum choices align with Nevada Standard expectations. The choice for the Science curriculum is up to the Charter and so we did select Amplify Science.

Physical education and health are essential parts of trauma informed instruction. The Nevada Statute 389.485 for P.E requires that students demonstrate competency in motor skills, patterns of movement and safety practices needed to perform a variety of physical activities needed to perform manipulative skills in combination with locomotor or non locomotor movements in a variety of environments. Students may be exempt from P.E. as cited in statute 389.488 for psychological or medical reasons, otherwise, all students will participate in related arts that will provide physical education and health, recess, movement, art, music, and STEM. We will ultimately want to have a computer lab for students in order to enhance technological literacy, but will operate from laptops until we can add a computer lab. We did seek a quote from Bright Box for Smart Boards to inspire the use of technology in the classroom which includes the digital component of the curriculum in case of pandemics or lockdowns in a virtual environment. Art classes allow students to express themselves and calms racing emotion and is great for an in class therapeutic response. Students may be exempt from P.E. through as cited in statute 389.488 for psychological or medical reasons. Students will participate in project based learning assignments after an introduction to the components of STEM, and they will learn how they work together in project based learning. Students will have access to design software, 3D printers, and the latest tools and tech for our students to create with, such as STEM projects, science projects and engineering through FIRST Nevada robotics and coding. 4) Identify the instructional strategies that will support the education plan. Explain why they are well suited for the anticipated student population. Outline the data, methods, and systems teachers will use to provide differentiated instruction to all students. Again, the data is formal and informal to be collected, disaggregated and used to inform all planning. The most effective and innovative methods of teaching, especially for the educationally disadvantaged students of color, are culturally responsive pedagogy and trauma-informed instruction through PBL. Once our teachers are professionally developed to understand the impacts of trauma on the students in their classroom, they are then able to develop meaningful relationships with students which allows them to learn in a safe environment. Furthermore, focusing on mastery-based instruction will ensure that students are making gains to close achievement gaps. The teachers will review formative and summative curriculum-based assessments through iReady, NWEA MAP, WIDA, and SBAC and will work together on Wednesday afternoons to disaggregate the data to develop lessons and strategize interventions. 19NRS 389.018(3)18https :/ /www .newharbinger .com/ 385) Explain how the proposed instructional model and curriculum will meet the needs of and enable measurable growth for all students, including students with disabilities, English language learners, economically disadvantaged students, at-risk students, and students above or below grade level, according to the Nevada Academic Content Standards 9F20 . The proposed instructional model and curriculum will meet the needs of all students because the program was designed for the population that we intend to serve and the curriculum is designed for differentiation. Students below grade level will be grouped according to the NWEA Learning Continuum and the curriculum that we selected has resources for students above and below grade level as well as for ELL students and the gifted student. For our gifted 3rd-5th graders we are considering GATE as a special education program for the gifted student that needs extended academic support. Our curriculum choice was based on reaching the bubble kids and not to select a curriculum that caters exclusively to the top achievers where everyone else is left behind, nor to the bottom where no one else is engaged; but to the middle which makes extension and modification easier for the teachers to design lessons for the gifted and the special education student. Our curriculum choices are aligned with the content standards for Nevada and have a plethora of resources for ELL students for all subjects with built in differentiation. We also looked at edReports to make sure that everything that we selected meets state expectations. 6) If the proposed charter school intends to include a career and technical education program, provide a description of the career and technical education program and courses that will be implemented by the charter school. This section is not applicable to Mind Your Books Charter School. 3.3 PROMOTION AND GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS Questions 1 and 2 are required of all applicants. Questions 3 and 4 are only required if the proposal includes a high school program. 1) Explain how students will matriculate through the school (e.g., promotion/retention policies) and how stakeholders will be informed of these policies. MYBCS is committed to ensuring students experience academic success with social emotional support. It will be the exception to the rule to retain a child as it is rarely the most effective intervention for a student. Most students will matriculate through the school based on their age and social promotion as outlined in the MYBCS Promotion & Retention Policy. If a teacher or parent believes that it is in the best interest for a student to be retained, the Charter School will hold a Student Study Team (SST) meeting. During the SST meeting, the team will discuss the recommendation, the interventions that have been implemented during the school year, and which interventions would be put in place to close the achievement gap. It may be that the student needs to be assessed for special education services based on Child Find laws. The team including the parent, teacher, and the Executive Director/Principal will need to agree that retention will be the most effective intervention. If the decision is made by the team to retain the student, they will sign the Retention Acknowledgement Form and the SST form. Regardless of promotion or retention, if there is a concern, the team will continue to monitor the progress of the student. Requirements for 8th grade promotion: English and Math must both have 1 \u00bd credits, Science and Social Studies must both have 1 credit. The student must have passing grades in these core classes during the seventh and eighth grades in order to be promoted to high school. If an eighth grade student does not meet the requirements, the student may be retained the following school year in eighth grade. An exception to this would be to place the student on academic probation with promotion to high school as long as the student meets the criteria. The criteria for academic probation is as follows: (1) the student needs \u00bd credit in one of the core classes, (2) the student meets or exceeds CRT scores needed 20https://doe.nv.gov/Nevada_Academic_Content_Standards/ 39for the credit deficiency, and (3) the student reaches 16 years of age at the start of the school year or during. Remedial instruction will take place in the core class where credit is needed during the ninth grade. If the student receives a passing grade, the probation will be removed. If a parent elects not to have the student on academic probation, the student will be retained in eighth grade the following school year. Parents will be informed of promotion and retention by email, physical mail, and as a letter attachment to the last parent report card pick up at the end of the 4th quarter. 2) Explain what systems and structures the school will implement for students at risk for retention, and/or dropping out, and/or not meeting the proposed graduation requirements, including plans to address students who are overage for the grade level. For high schools, describe your plans to support students needing to access credit recovery options. The systems and structures that MYBCS will implement for students at risk for retention include monitoring the academic progress of the student through frequent formative and summative assessments and monitoring the social emotional well-being through data. As the student reaches grades 4 and higher, the student will play an active role in the process of setting short term and long term goals for themselves in student portfolios. Students and parents will receive written resources about strategies to prevent dropping out of school. MYBCS will assess and evaluate students in Kindergarten, third, fifth, and eighth grades for retention and must offer every available intervention before a student is retained. The parents will receive notification blasts from Infinite Campus regarding their student's low scores or failures because the teachers will be required to enter grades into Infinite Campus a minimum of 2 grades per week. When there are more than 15 absences in a school year retention is imminent and conferences with the Principal, parent, teacher(s), and therapist will help to determine the best interventions for promotion. Teachers will monitor the student and inform all parties of progress or will inform the Principal if the student is not meeting the goals outlined in the first conference. The Principal and the teacher in agreement, will have the final decision to retain a student. Students will be retained only once for the same grade level in Kindergarten, 3rd, 5th, and 8th. If an 8th grade student becomes overage and has failing grades and low test scores then we will refer them to Beacon Academy for credit deficient students who need a pathway toward graduating on time in the 12th grade. 3.4 DRIVING FOR RESULTS The SPCSA will evaluate the performance of every charter school annually, and when considering applications for renewal and contract amendment according to a set of academic, financial, and organizational performance standards that will be incorporated into the charter agreement and measured by the SPCSA Charter School Performance Framework 1 1F21, the Nevada School Performance Framework adopted by the Nevada Department of Education 12F22, and applicable law and regulation. Applicants are expected to propose additional goals to complement or supplement, but not supplant, the SPCSA's performance standards. These goals should be school-specific, mission-driven academic, financial, or organizational goals. All included indicators, measures, and metrics are expected to be rigorous, valid, and reliable. 1) Describe the mission-specific academic goals for the school. State goals clearly in terms of the measures or assessments you plan to use and describe the process by which you will determine and set targets. Mission-Specific Goals: According to the data and statistics for 89115, students will come to us with academic deficiencies and we want to be proactive in measuring whether our education model is having a significant impact year over year. We believe that balancing the emotions with academic strength is pivotal to ensuring that 22https://doe.nv.gov/Accountability/NSPF/21https://charterschools.nv.gov/ForSchools/Accountability/ 40our students are well balanced in logic, emotion, and academics. MYBCS' goals are rooted in academic growth and proficiency, social emotional competencies, and student self-regulation. It is the responsibility of MYBCS to ensure that our students are prepared to compete at a national level, and to pursue self-determined goals and aspirations in order to have meaningful contributions to the community through engaged citizenship. Annual Performance and Growth Goals: After attending MYBCS for two years, 70% of the student population will achieve academic growth based on RIT scores from their NWEA results. ELA Proficiency: Students will gain 10% growth in ELA proficiency based on the SBAC ELA results annually. Reading Level: After attending MYBCS for two years, 70% of students will achieve a reading level on or above their grade level. Math Proficiency: Students will gain 10% growth in Math proficiency based on the SBAC Math results annually. Science Proficiency: Students will gain 10% growth in Science proficiency based on the Nevada Science Assessment results annually. Social Studies Proficiency: After attending MYBCS for two years, students will achieve 75% on informal internal assessments quarterly. Social Emotional Learning: After attending MYBCS for two years, 70% of students will achieve a T-score of 41 or above through DESSA & CASEL Framework. 2) In the table below, outline the annual performance and growth goals that the school will set in order to meet or exceed expectations as outlined in the SPCSA Academic Performance Framework indicators and to meet state expectations for student academic growth in accordance with the Nevada School Performance Framework (NSPF). You may add rows as needed.

The baselines for the data were set based on the Clark County School District proficiency rates. Using all data, we will set and revise quarterly performance targets to ensure that we are on a trajectory to align with the SPCSA performance standards as well as Academic Standards. 4) Articulate how the school will measure, evaluate, and report academic progress - of individual students, student cohorts, special populations, and the entire school - throughout the school year, at the end of the academic year, and for the first six years of operation. How will the school monitor for disparities in academic performance between student groups? 42We will measure academic proficiency by using the Nevada Academic Standards for all curriculum and assessment. We will then take the data from all assessments and disaggregate it in our Wednesday meetings which will be led by the Principal in order to get a snapshot of academic performance both grade level and school wide. Teachers will receive intervention support and resources through Professional Development led by Nevada Ready, teacher leaders, and administration in order to learn how to create support for their students in their lesson planning. When disparities are found between student groups, the Learning Continuum will provide a standards based overview of where students need greater support, and small groups can ensue. MYBCS will measure, evaluate, and report academic performance of individual students by collecting data from all assessments both formal and informal by running reports on all tests that we will administer such as NWEA, iReady, SBAC, and classroom assessment. 5) Describe the corrective actions the school will take if it falls short of student academic achievement goals at the classroom, cohort, special population, and/or school-wide level during the year or based on end of year assessments. Explain what performance levels would trigger such corrective actions and who would be responsible for implementing them. Our leadership team will collaborate with those teachers that are falling short of professional and classroom goals and the teacher would be required to complete additional PD courses in the lacking areas reflected in their evaluations. Support will be offered to each teacher who may need help with creating and monitoring student groups within their classrooms by teacher leaders and/or by the Principal. End of year assessments results will be reviewed over the summer by the Principal and the Board in order to develop school wide interventions to align the school with academic and SPCSA Framework goals. The performance levels that would trigger corrective action are such as if the school scores lower than 50 points on the SPCSA Framework, and if the students are not meeting growth targets and proficiency levels by scoring beneath the target projections. If SPCSA Framework goals are out of alignment, then the Board and the Principal will be responsible for implementing corrective actions that will bring the school back into alignment with the goals. These actions will help to strengthen the core of the school year-over-year as the snapshot becomes clearer over time because our practices will strengthen and deepen while sharpening our focus and informing action steps. 6) In addition to mandatory state testing, identify the primary interim academic assessments the school will use to assess student learning needs and ensure progress towards SPCSA and state proficiency targets. Describe how these assessments will be used. a) How will you support teachers in developing embedded assessments and checks for understanding in order to ensure that instruction meets student needs? Our primary interim assessment vehicles are iReady, NWEA progress monitoring, MAP, WIDA, and classroom assessments, and end of unit assessments. Teachers will use the MYBCS curriculum to develop embedded assessments. There is professional development through workshops that prepares teachers to review core features of curriculum, data triangulation through the use of assessment results, and inspiring the use of curriculum creativity where teachers will learn how to create standards based assessments and to identify evidence-based, function-informed interventions. Workshops will be planned and staff PD is scheduled for Wednesdays in order to support all stakeholders. b) Explain how you know that the proposed interim assessments are valid and reliable indicators of progress. Explain how these interim assessments align with the school's curriculum, performance goals, and the Nevada Academic Content Standards. Our interim assessment platforms are used in Clark County Schools both public and charter schools and are in alignment with Nevada Academic Content Standards. The curriculum has embedded assessments and the teachers will be developed into using their creativity to make assessments within their classroom that match the objectives and standards of the lessons. 43c) Articulate how interim assessments will be used to inform instruction and key decisions throughout the school year. How will teachers and school leaders be trained in their use? Interim assessments will be used to determine progress, create interventions, and track RTI information daily, weekly, and quarterly. The process for the instructional model would be to have diagnostic research, plan instruction, teach, assess, analyze, and then determine whether to move on to another topic or reteach the current topic. Teachers will be trained in the data-driven process and analyze the data during the Wednesday weekly meetings. 7) For each interim assessment identified above, provide quarterly performance targets that you will use to confirm that the school is on-track to meet the previously described academic goals throughout the school's first year with students. Add rows as needed.

The student's information will be uploaded prior to enrollment and it is secure. MYBCS would activate or \"go live\" in the Summer of 2024. The data is uploaded and stored in a repository and is HIPAA and FERPA compliant. If our teachers were grading in Google Classroom and conducting quizzes to be graded, then the gradebook pass back will populate the score, placing it into IC for grades and assignments for each student without a breach of data. Infinite Campus is also a record holder for discipline notes, behavior incidents, attendance, FRL applications, and a parent portal. There is also a messenger blast alert system regarding grades and weather in text and voice. 9) Describe the school's organizational or financial performance goals the school will have. Explain how these align to the SPCSA Organizational and Financial Performance Frameworks MYBCS organizational and financial performance goals are in complete alignment with the SPCSA's financial framework requirements which represent a financially healthy charter school. They are namely maintaining a healthy current asset to current liability ratio exceeding 1.1, maintaining cash on hand of 60 days or more, correctly projecting enrollment, not defaulting on debt or lease payments, maintaining a healthy operating margin on an annual basis of 3% or more, maintaining a healthy fund balance on an ongoing basis of 5% or more, maintaining a debt to asset ratio above 1.0, and maintaining a Debt and/or Lease service ratio at 1.1 or better. This is all projected to be accomplished within just a few years of opening if not sooner. 3.5 A TRISKSTUDENTS AND SPECIALPOPULATIONS At Risk Students 1) What is the school's definition of at-risk students? What academic and behavioral data, processes, and methods will be used to identify at-risk students and their needs? 45MYBCS defines at-risk students as individuals that are living in environments that produce negative and vulnerable conditions. These conditions do not provide adequate resources nor do they direct attention to their developmental needs, and the risk is greater than the child's ability to control or address. At risk students have little to no resources. This population of students that are underserved in their community come from various economic households and are students from diverse backgrounds. These students may have chronic absenteeism. They may also suffer from food scarcity and homelessness. The homeless student would receive automatic enrollment rights into MYBCS and other benefits cited in the McKinney-Vento Act such as case management for emergency shelter, health care services, and food stamp services. The students who lack adequate mental health resources will be addressed by clinically managing the mental health disparities through our Clinical Model. The MYBCS Mission and Vision declares to serve students in a manner that balances the whole brain; both logic and emotion, and couples it with academic best practices. Our staff and leadership will mirror the school culture of social emotional justice. Upon enrollment, students will be ranked into three tiered groups in order to identify the emotionally at-risk student. With regard to clinical placement levels, Tier 1 includes every student on the MYBCS campus. From Kindergarten through 8thgrade, each grade will engage in a morning SEL class through Second Step curriculum in order to set the tone for the day. This class has a professional development component for teachers that is self-paced, taught by the teacher to the students, and supported by the therapist interns who will address SEL topics of social-emotional regulation. These topics may include empathy, making friends, respecting others, etc. Tier 2 students have IEPs or 504 Plans for behavioral regulation. Parents may opt to have their child's treatment plan reviewed by the Clinical Director; LCSW (and not the interns). Their IEPs or 504 plans would be reviewed by the Special Education Director and shared with the Clinical Director and the teachers. The goals of the treatment plan are encouraged through our UNLV interns and checked quarterly for benchmark growth. Campus support is readily available because the teacher knows that this student has a diagnosis and will have received PD for best management strategies through Nevada Ready for SEAD/SEL 101 with Strategies for Students, Restorative SEL, and our Clinical Director. We will encourage pre-existing clinical goals and not override them. These goals and data are reviewed in our Wednesday staff meetings by the clinical team and PTTCs are planned. Short Form CASEL surveys will be given to students quarterly, and teachers will receive CASEL PDs. DESSA assessments will be a part of our culture and students will have their own portal to engage in a reflection of their own social and emotional strengths and empowers them to set goals for growth. Academic goals are reviewed by the teachers in conjunction with the therapists and parents and students for data use in their student portfolios. Tier 3 students may be diagnosed by the Clinical Director in the parent's presence and at their documented request, and this student may also have an IEP or 504. The clinical goals are discussed in conjunction with the academic benchmarks and the team meets to assess growth toward or away from academic and therapeutic goals. MYBCS will not discriminate against any student regardless of gender, race, religion, disability, socio-economic status, or sexual preference. We will enroll all students who are eligible to apply. We anticipate that we will have 97% FRL students. Families can identify this risk by providing their Income Verification form at the time of enrollment to qualify for free and reduced lunches. The Academic data that will be used to identify student's academic needs is NWEA Reading and Math taken three times a year beginning in the Fall of 2024. Upon baseline enrollment and every quarter thereafter, MYBCS will provide students with a Short Form Assessment Survey to inform CASEL benchmark needs that UNLV would use to inform therapeutic groupings. From this data, the therapist interns and the clinical director will design groups to address overarching mental health concerns, thereby forming groups that are socially emotionally based such as anger, grief & loss, or any other topic that dominates the assessment data. When students enroll at MYBCS, and they have a preexisting IEP from another school, then the IEP will be given to the Special Education Director to store this FERPA Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act protected file-document within Infinite Campus while maintaining the very strict FERPA compliance. A digital copy of the IEP will be provided to all parties such as the teacher and the therapist through Infinite Campus. The Special Education Director will cross-reference the IEP in Infinite Campus to ensure that we are receiving the updated copy with the most recent modifications and goals. 462) Describe the school's approach to help remediate students' academic underperformance. Detail the interventions to be implemented. Cite the research/rationale for the chosen methods. How will you measure the success of your academic remediation efforts (in year 1, year 3, year 5, and beyond)? Per Nevada Law NRS.388.208, an annual review of a student's academic plan is required. MYBCS' approach to support students requiring remediation is established through data collected both formally and informally. Year 1 is when we capture baseline scores for the whole school using iReady, NWEA MAP, and SBAC data. Research shows that students using iReady consistently outperform their peers once tested on state measures. \"Evidence standards show positively and statistically significant gains for students receiving iReady instruction above that of their control group counterparts in both reading and mathematics in iReady and externally such as the SBAC, and NWEA MAP.\"23The MYBCS end of year 1 academic review would take place with all stakeholders at the table such as teachers, administration and SPED Director. Data is collected and analyzed during our Wednesday data meetings. This comprehensive overview of each student's performance will inform our methods and programs and interventions for year 2. As data is collected MYBCS will provide ample intervention strategies for students during the school year. The teacher then sets progress monitoring goals in reading through NWEA weekly. Data-driven instruction for K-8 is differentiated based on these assessment results. We can see what strategies and interventions worked and what didn't work through data analysis. We make the adjustments in year two by continuing our academic and support programs, removing some, or adding new ones to pair with iReady, which addresses fluency, decoding, and phonics for grades K-2. We would use all available data to study trends in SEL, school climate, and academics and make data-driven decisions about everything. With the NWEA MAP(K-8) data, and SBAC (3-8) data we can establish interventions for students individually. When we find underperforming students, we form small group instruction and work with community partnership to establish Mathnasium tutoring, Family Math Nights for after school ELA and math enrichment in order to address math and ELA deficiencies. We will measure the success of our remediation efforts by analyzing data collected school-wide from year one to see what worked and what didn't. We add or remove programs in year two and continue to assess and analyze data to inform instruction. By year 3, we have data collected as a cross-sagittal study. This study further reveals what strategies are working and we do more of that to maintain an incline in year 4, year 5 and beyond. We will also track how the school wide performance affects our NSPF ratings in middle and elementary. We will use the NSPF data to adjust our strategies and interventions to achieve the maximum points for elementary and middle school growth, proficiency, achievement, and engagement according to the SPCSA Framework. 3) Describe your Response to Intervention model in detail, including the interventions and the anticipated proportion of the student body served at each tier level. Explain the methodology for determining these proportions. Oursystem will be mirroring the best practices provided by the Multi Tier System of Supports (at the American Institutes for Research) which includes three tiers of intensity for instruction, intervention, and support. Tier 1 includes high-quality, schoolwide academic, social, emotional and behavioral programming and supports designed to meet the needs of all students. At Tier 2, we will provide small group, standardized academic interventions or targeted behavioral or mental health supports using validated intervention programs to support students identified as at-risk. Tier 3 includes intensive intervention for students not responding to Tier 2 through instruction and supports that are intensified and individualized based on student need. At all levels, attention will be on selection of evidence-based practices and fidelity of implementation, with consideration for cultural and linguistic responsiveness and recognition of student strengths. 23i-Ready Research Efficacy Brief 2019 (sbsd.k12.ca.us) 47Tier 1:includes academic, social, emotional, and behavioral curriculum, instruction, and supports aligned to grade-level standards and student needs. At Tier 1, our staff will use instructional strategies and practices shown to be effective for the student population and educational context. In effective Tier 1 systems, most students benefit from Tier 1 programming alone and teachers use differentiation to ensure all students can access and benefit from core programming. Consistency in the use of evidence-based practices and supports is essential for collective efficacy at Tier 1. Effective Tier 1 ensures a positive school climate and conditions for learning. Tier 2:provides small group, standardized academic interventions or targeted behavioral or mental health supports using validated intervention programs. The intervention and support design will demonstrate a positive effect for desired outcomes and are aligned with student needs. Tier 2 interventions and supports are delivered with fidelity at an appropriate duration and frequency to ensure students have increased opportunities for practice and corrective feedback. Tier 3:Our schools implement intensive intervention to help students with severe and persistent learning and/or behavioral needs, including students with disabilities. Data-based individualization (DBI) is a validated approach to providing intensive intervention in academics and behavior. This process will be characterized by an increased intensity and individualization of instruction and tailored support. Because the proportions will vary from grade to grade it will be data-driven with each tier specifically proportioned. The methodology will include the following processes advocated by the MTSS: 1.Screening: Identifying students' level of risk and evaluate the effectiveness of core instruction 2.Diagnostic: Determine student strengths and skill gaps, as well as factors within the instruction, and environment that impact learning 3.Progress Monitoring: Measure student responsiveness, quantify a student's growth rate, and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions 4.Fidelity: Measure the extent to which practices and assessment are used as intended. 4) How will you communicate the need for remediation to parents? MYBCS will communicate the need for remediation through official data reports from various platforms such as iReady, NWEA, and SBAC. MYBCS will provide weekly communication such as Class Dojo which connects the parent directly to the teacher in the classroom. We will send out emails and mail letters to home. Students will receive report cards quarterly. Parents can check for grades in Infinite Campus as the expectation is for the teacher to enter two grades per subject per week and families can set notifications when a score drops below a certain threshold. Families will receive phone calls and participate in PTTCs (parent-teacher-therapist-conferences) to discuss goals and benchmarks.24 5) What interventions will be offered for students exhibiting early signs of behavioral concerns, mental health concerns, and/or need for social emotional supports? How will individual plans for students be implemented and monitored? MYBCS is a proposed clinic with a school inside and this model will help us to offer interventions for students exhibiting early signs of behavioral and mental health concerns as reflected in their DESSA scores and Short Form Surveys. This is what our vision and mission entails; the balancing of logic and emotion so that learning can occur. UNLV will render therapeutic services that support social-emotional competence. We host three social emotional Tiers established during enrollment. Daily students will develop strategies through full SEL classes and therapy sessions on campus. They will develop emotional resources so when faced with adversity and strong emotion they have the power to rewrite the moment. Balancing the left and right brain; logic and emotion, thereby creates a stabilizing life-force for the student 24NRS: CHAPTER 388 - SYSTEM OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION (state.nv.us) 48which levels the playing field in any arena. Our students will be able to lead future endeavors, gain and create access to possibilities and opportunities for life-long achievement in high school, college, and life in general. Students will be able to academically persevere through the support of their social emotional well-being. Students will receive a strong academic foundation encouraging the demonstration of creativity, thinking critically, collaborating with peers and adults, and effective communication skills. Students will develop and demonstrate social emotional competence through emotional regulation, and positive social interactions. Our core vision and mission precepts are rooted in intellectual curiosity both in emotional self-regulation and a strong academic foundation. According to the CDC National report in 2018-2019, 15% of children between the ages of 12-17 had major depressive episodes. The CDC also reported in 2016 that children ages 3-17 suffered depression and received treatment by 78%. 59.3% had anxiety and received treatment, and more than 53.5% had behavior disorders and received treatment. We know according to national stats that our Clinical Model will be an asset to the community due to a consistent rise in these negative and dangerous social emotional trends in children.25This includes suicidal ideation across all ages and grade levels. One in 6 children had a diagnosis of mental, behavioral, or developmental disorder, and 8.9% had attempted suicide. With the anxieties of our ever-changing world, we believe that a campus focused and rooted in the perseverance of emotional wellness to clear the way for learning will help MYBCS to raise citizens that will be able to balance logic and emotion who are better able to listen and learn. They will be able to rewrite the moment. Individual plans will be implemented by intersecting academic goals based on formal and informal data and assessment results both clinical and academic. The clinical goals which align with the DSM-V and CASEL benchmarks will be general topics taught in Second Step classes and reinforced in therapy sessions for students with treatment plans and for families that require it according to DESSA scores. The clinical goals may be derived from pre-existing treatment plan goals that are monitored through UNLV therapists in conjunction with the MYBCS campus clinical director. All the stakeholders come to the table to progress monitor the goals through PTTCs (Parent-teacher-therapist-conferences). Every student will have an individual pathway to closely monitor behavioral goals. Many of their common goals will be the base for selecting therapy group topics such as depression, grief and loss, or hopelessness. The clinicians will know where the groups are most needed through the Short Form Assessment Surveys and DESSA results. The students will take these quarterly Short Form assessments and work with those goals in therapy for the entire quarter. The Short Forms will be sent to student emails. The short form aligns with CASEL benchmarks. The PTTC will also analyze the results of DESSA which the students will take as formal assessment. The Dessa K-8 assessment is a teacher parent rating tool established as 72 questions, 5-8 minutes to complete, hosts 8 competencies which align with CASEL benchmarks and is available in English and Spanish. This data will be imperative in the PTTC conferences to inform therapeutic support and the establishment of clinical goals for students with or without treatment plans. Here is an image of how DESSA merges with CASEL benchmarks and domains. \"Trusted by Johns Hopkins University, American Institutes for Research (AIR), the Rand Corporation, City Year, and the Y of the USA for use in major studies, the DESSA sets the standard for SEL assessment. The Dessa measures were developed to meet or exceed the standards for SEL assessment. The DESSA measures were developed to meet or exceed the standards promulgated by the American Educational Research Association, the American Psychological Association, and the Natural Council on Measurement in Education (AERA, 2014).\"26 Special Populations 1) Explain the track record of one or more members of the founding school team (e.g., founding board member, identified instructional leader, etc.) in working to achieve high academic outcomes for: a) students with disabilities, including students with mild, moderate, and severe disabilities, 26https://apertureed.com/dessa25https://www.cdc.gov/childrensmentalhealth/data.html 49MYBCS has worked with several special education teachers during the application process that showed an interest in teaching at the Charter School, but did not want to become part of the Committee to Form due to prior commitments. At the appropriate time we will interview and hire licensed Special Education Teachers and a Special Education Director. b) English language learners, As a special education requirement, we will hire ELL/TESOL endorsed teachers prior to opening. Again, the teachers that showed an interest had prior commitments to their current jobs. c) homeless and migrant students, and As teachers, Cami and Stuart have taught students that have experienced homelessness when working side by side with kids and therapists from the Juvenile Justice Department. While serving students through case management for families needing community resources such as homelessness, they have both helped families receive resources such as tutoring and food scarcity support through Three Square. When the school opens we would follow the McKinney Vento Act to ensure that homeless students receive priority enrollment as well as follow up with case management for the families. Upon enrollment families would need to complete the SPCSA Student Residency Form so we can determine who may need further assistance. d) intellectually gifted students. Cami and Stuart have worked as teachers that have taught gifted students. We have had to differentiate and modify lessons to accommodate and extend learning for this body of students. PBL will offer extensive opportunities to extend lessons for deeper cognitive experience. 2) Explain how you will identify and meet the learning needs of students with mild, moderate, and severe disabilities in the least restrictive environment possible. Specify the programs, strategies, and supports you will provide, including: a) How will the school identify students who require special education services? How will the school handle overidentification of students having a disability that qualifies them for special education services? What will be the process to transition a student out of special education who has been incorrectly identified as having a disability in the past? Special education students will be identified during the enrollment process by the parent, staff, or physician through either health, behavioral, (504) or developmental screenings that may be pre-existing. If no concerns are identified then the student remains in the general education population and documentation is kept for 6 weeks to ensure that no concerns arise. If concerns are identified through the screenings, then the student is referred to special education for the evaluation and determination of eligibility for services. If they meet the criteria for special education services then an IEP is developed by the SPED team and the student's placement will be reviewed annually. If the data reflects that the student does not meet this criteria then they will return to the general education population without accommodation and modification of work expectations. After the initial year of enrollment, we will have an idea of the special education needs of our students. Being a school that focuses on trauma-informed instruction as a critical value, then we will likely be a choice for many students that have disabilities. We do not see this as a barrier as we will accommodate all disabilities that enroll at our school. Students will be identified for need services following an evaluation if a parent sends consent or a diagnosis from a physician. If a student is identified to need an IEP then the meeting to develop the IEP must happen within 30 calendar days of the initial eligibility requirements. When a student is deemed ready to exit the SPED program, then the parents 50are notified and involved in the exit process. All information is reviewed such as parental observations and notes, classwork, therapy notes, assessments, and review of goals and short-term objectives. b) What specific instructional programs, practices, and strategies the school will employ to provide a continuum of services? Describe how students with severe intellectual, learning, and/or emotional disabilities will be served. The program that we are happy to bring to the community is through the partnership we have solidified with UNLV to provide free counseling and therapy for all students in need which includes therapy during the day and can be scheduled into the student's school day. In practice, UNLV and Nevada Ready will provide professional development so that our teachers are up to date on the best practices of trauma informed instruction. Socio-Emotional classes will take place as part of our counseling program. The CASEL curriculum will be used to provide a base of instruction. Students with severe intellectual, and learning disabilities will be supported through our Clinical Model and Special Education program. c) How will special education and related service personnel collaborate with general education teachers (e.g., team teaching, team planning, etc.) to ensure that all students are able to access a rigorous general academic curriculum? Every Wednesday, teachers will have an opportunity to collaborate and plan, assess data, and receive professional development. Each classroom teacher will have prep periods and in addition, the special education teacher, ESL, and general education can plan together during our Wednesday meetings. Our school believes that collaborative planning is an essential part of the learning process and have made it a part of our education model to carve a space for it to happen with fidelity. d) How will you ensure qualified staffing to meet the needs of students with disabilities? Federal and Nevada law requires licensure for special education teachers, related service personnel, and psychologists at charter schools. As part of our hiring process, we are requiring that all special education teachers are fully certified according to the State of Nevada upon hire. Clinicians and psychologists will be contracted based on the needs of our students. e) What are your plans for monitoring and evaluating the progress and success of students who qualify for special education and related services, including the process for exiting students from special education services, as needed. How will curricular and instructional decisions be tracked and monitored by IEP teams and school personnel? Our tier one data monitoring approach will encompass all students. For students that are identified for special needs outside of tier one instruction will be monitored by the student support team which will meet monthly. Progress monitoring data from classrooms will be discussed along with the grades and attendance of students that are special needs. f) What are your plans for monitoring and evaluating the extent to which your special education program complies with relevant federal and state laws? The Special Education Director will serve as the district representative during IEP meetings and will bear responsibility for special education plans and for remaining in SPED compliance. They are the main person on the IEP team monitoring the assurance that all IEPs are in compliance. At board meetings, a report will be given so that they are aware of the special education statistics. 51g)For proposed middle and high schools, discuss how you will develop and implement transition plans for special education students. Our 8th grade students with special needs (special education and ES) will spend the second half of the semester sharing plans or receiving guidance on next steps to enrolling at the right high school and prospects for what students will do for college or career success. Students will always receive college and career mentorship within the project based learning in classroom assignments. As part of the transition files for rising ninth graders, students will have plans with the most up to date data for proficiency, growth, and interest data. It is important to our school that students land in the right school and have college and career success. 3) Explain how the school will meet the needs of English language learners (EL), including: a) How will the school ensure proper identification of English language learners? How will you work to avoid misidentification and ensure proper identification of all students who qualify for services? During the enrollment process, parents will complete the SPCSA Home Language Survey (HLS). If the survey shows the student speaks another language other than English, or if the child's first language was not English, or another language is utilized in the home other than English, then that student will be identified as a potential EL student. MYBCS will use the ACCESS test (English Language Proficiency Assessment produced by WIDA) to assess our students. The results of this assessment will help to determine if a student qualifies for EL services. Annually, students who have limited English proficiency will be required to test during the beginning of the school year per the Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015. We will avoid misidentification by ensuring the EL/TESOL teachers are certified and that there is oversight by the leadership staff. b) How will the results of the WIDA Screener and other identification and program placement decisions be communicated to staff and parents? According to the results of the Home Language Survey, parents will be notified within 30 days that their child will take the WIDA assessment at the beginning of the school year. After the student completes the ACCESS, the parents will be notified within 15 days of the results. If the student does not qualify for EL services, then the EL/TESOL teacher will inform parents of the rationale for disqualification by communicating the results. After the parents are notified of the student's qualification of EL services, then the EL/TESOL teachers will inform the teacher of record and the Special Education teacher. c) How will you ensure qualified staffing to meet the needs of EL students, conduct assessments, and monitor the progress of EL students? Nevada law requires licensure (TESL endorsement) for the primary teacher providing EL services in pull-out and inclusive environments at charter schools. MYBCS will employ EL/TESOL teachers who have the certification and ELAD endorsement. The EL/TESOL teachers will complete professional development structured around English Language Learning during MYBCS scheduled PD time two weeks before the start of instruction and throughout the school year. The Nevada State Education Association (NSEA) has specialized PD for ELL and teachers can complete up to 8 micro-credential courses (15 hours each).27These courses include advocating for ELL students, analyzing assessments, understanding academic language, using second language acquisition, strategies, formative assessments, and using standards to plan instruction and practice. It is ideal to hire bilingual teachers of English and Spanish to ensure that the needs of the students will be met. The EL/TESOL teachers will be conducting the assessments and monitoring the progress of EL students, with the Special Education Director in oversight of the program. 27CategoryDetail (certificationbank.com) 52d) What specific instructional programs, practices, and strategies will be employed to ensure academic success and equitable access to the core academic program for English language learners? MYBCS will have a translator during assemblies, PTTCs, school-wide events, and family night. We have PBL as a core tenant, research shows that it is beneficial to the EL student to experience language through project base rather than just studying words and language in isolation. \"PBL projects can give students something to latch onto as they're learning to use a new language. This can be more engaging than studying words and skills in an abstract way, as the language is being used for an authentic purpose.\"28 e) What plans are in place for monitoring and evaluating the progress and success of EL students, including the process for exiting students from EL services as needed? EL/TESOL teachers will be monitoring and evaluating ELL students with formal and informal interim assessments throughout the school year. Along with the WIDA test data from the Fall baseline and the interim assessment data, teachers will adapt instruction to meet the student's needs. Teachers will work collaboratively with the Special Education director to ensure the student's growth and progress is inclining. In order for students to exit EL services, students should be able to speak, write, and understand English proficiently. They should be able to demonstrate English proficiency in all academic core classes, including reading and comprehension. If a student scores a 4 on the ACCESS test, then MYBCS determines that the student will be exited from EL services. If a student scores a 6 on the ACCESS test, then the student will be automatically exited from EL services.29 4) Explain how the school will identify and differentiate to meet the needs of intellectually gifted students in a way that extends their learning and offers them unique, tailored opportunities. Include information on how staffing will be structured to ensure that gifted students are adequately supported. MYBCS will identify intellectually gifted students by analyzing data and taking note of who consistently exceeds in their assessment performance. We will create small groups for them based on the NWEA Learning Continuum and other assessment data. Students may be referred by their parents, therapist, teachers, or Principal for gifted services. We propose to incept a GATE program that eligibility is determined by an IQ test. The GATE assessment is used by many public-school districts including several in California and New York State. It is an IQ test for kids based upon the Otis-Lennon School Ability Test (OLSAT). The tests measure basic math, reasoning and verbal skills, and are typically given in the 3rd through 5th grades and if we include GATE, then our teacher would be properly endorsed to work with gifted students. We would be sure to make sure that this student population would have robust PBL opportunities during school and in after school clubs. 5) Explain how the school will meet the needs of homeless/migrant students: a) How will the school ensure proper identification of students and families who qualify for homeless and/or migrant services? How will you work to avoid misidentification and ensure proper identification of all students who qualify for services? To avoid misidentification and to ensure confidentiality, upon enrollment, families will complete the SPCSA Residency Questionnaire as a document added to the enrollment package. The McKinney Vento Act is administered by FEMA (The Federal Emergency Management Agency) and protects homeless students and their families through certain government protected rights. The SPCSA has developed a questionnaire that families will quickly fill out during the enrollment 29All About Wida Online (nv.gov)28Supporting ELLs in PBL Projects | Edutopia 53process to help us determine what services they may need granted as rights through the McKinney Vento Act. By law, we will automatically enroll homeless students. b) How will you assess the needs of homeless and/or migrant students and their families and ensure that they receive required services? The SPCSA Residency Questionnaire highlights the various needs of the families and the results are shared with UNLV therapists for case management. UNLV will connect families to the proper care in the community such as shelter information, food stamp or TANF acquisition, health care and mental health care. The students will be able to benefit from the MYBCS Clinical Model which is at no cost to families as it is part of our mission to ensure the emotional vitality of students. 3.6 PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT 1) Discuss the core components of professional development and how these components will support effective implementation of the educational program. Discuss the extent to which professional development will be conducted internally or externally and will be individualized or uniform. Some PDs will be internal and some external. The core components of professional development for MYBCS are to build and strengthen learning communities to increase effectiveness and results for all students to reflect continuous improvement in goal alignment, leadership to increase educator effectiveness by developing capacity, advocation, and creating support groups, resources to increase educator effectiveness and improves results for all students, datato increase educator effectiveness for students by creating or developing standards based interventions based on formal and informal assessment results, learning designs that increases educator effectiveness by integrating theories, research, and models of human learning for student interventions, implementation by sustaining support for professional learning for long-term change, outcomes professional evaluations to increase effectiveness and results for all students, equityto increase results for all students on equitable access for opportunities and outcomes with emphasis on achievement and closing gaps and disparities between student groups, cultural competency increases educator effectiveness and facilitates educator self-examination and awareness of their own knowledge, skills and actions that pertain to culture and culturally-responsive strategies. PD will be both individualized as well as uniform and will be held weekly, quarterly, and as needed on Wednesdays and at other required times throughout the year. 2) Provide an overview of professional development that will take place prior to school opening. Explain what will be covered during this induction period, how teachers will be prepared to deliver any unique or challenging aspects of the curricula and instructional methods, and a general timeline for when this professional development will be delivered. Ensure alignment to the incubation year plan. The MYBCS induction period will be from July 24, 2024 to August 9, 2024. We have scheduled July 24th-26th 2024 as the first 3 days to work in your classroom days, one day of icebreakers, staff lunch, and meet and greet, and 2 weeks of state mandated PD for the Board, school leaders, teachers, and non certified staff which is scheduled to begin on July 30, 2024. July 29, 2024 is scheduled for teachers to meet the Clinical Director and receive PD on PTTCs and how the clinical resources merge with the classroom so that our teachers will be prepared to deliver unique and challenging aspects of the curricula and instructional methods that intersect both clinical and academic goals. Many of the PD are mandated and will be planned annually per their associated NRS code directives. The PD will include MTSS Tier 1 Summer workshop August 6th, and 7th, the Model Policy for a Safe and Respectful Learning Environment NRS 388.134 on July 30, 2024, Bullying & Cyberbullying NRS 388.1342 on August 2, 2024, on August 1, 2024, SafeVoice NRS 388.1455.4 on August 2, 2024, Handle With Care NRS 388.1451 on July 30, 2024, School Safety Specialist Training NRS 388.910 on July 31, 2024, Crisis Response and Emergency Training 54NRS 388.245.4 (h) on July 31, 2024, Suicide Prevention for School resource Officers NRS.2565 on August 5, 2024, Suicide Prevention for Teachers and Students NRS 388.256.2 (c) on August 5, 2024, and Response to Incident on August 1, 2024. School based PD will be ongoing and constant throughout the year. On Thursday, August 8th the Clinical Director and interns will provide a workshop for all staff on understanding common mental health diagnoses in children and how specific symptomatology in children manifests in order to teach resilience, and PPTC protocol. On August 9th, we will provide securities training for active shooters, curriculum, (NEPF) Professional Standards review, and to begin planning lessons for the week. The staff may come in on Saturday, August 10th to finish organizing their rooms and bulletin boards. 3) Describe the expected number of days/hours for professional development throughout the school year, and explain how the school calendar, daily schedule, and staffing structure accommodate this plan. Include time scheduled for common planning or collaboration. How will such time be used? We have planned a minimum of 46 PD days including our Wednesday staff meetings from 2pm to 4pm for data discussion and to plan strategic interventions. Wednesdays are early dismissal days and the students are dismissed at staggering times but will all be dismissed by 2 pm. For the parents needing options for early drop off and after school care we will seek to contract Safe Key a before and after school remediation based program. The dismissal times are outlined in our daily schedule. Staff development days are scheduled for data analysis and team level meetings K-2, 3-5, and 6-8. Grade level teams will be organized by the lead teacher, and may replace whole staff meetings on Wednesdays. We have scheduled Professional Development for the staff which are outlined on the school calendar as September 9th, October 7th & 8th, January 27th, and April 7th. Data disaggregation, Second Step, and Infinite Campus are some of the professional development training that will occur during the summer and require maintenance throughout the school year. There will be professional development for our curriculum usage and differentiation, as well as EL resource use. 4) Describe how teachers will be coached in and supported outside of the professional development outlined so far in this section. Teachers will be coached upon request, walkthroughs, biannual evaluations, mentorship, and also by suggesting PDs to us that they may have found useful. National Charter Schools Institute (NCSI) and National Association of Elementary School Principals (NAESP) will provide professional development courses, conferences, webinars, virtual training, and events for the Principal/Executive Director. For teachers, the Professional Learning Board on the NSEA website provides professional development towards the renewal of their license. Touro University and Southern Nevada Regional Professional Development Program (RPDP) are proposed websites that teachers can utilize for finding personal PD courses. Teachers are free to use other PD websites, such as Lead 4 Change and will be encouraged to continue to seek personal growth and to maintain their CEUs for licensure because we hope to work with new teachers and teacher interns. 5) How will teachers be supported and developed to ensure they are prepared to meet the needs of students who require additional supports (ex. special education, English language learners, etc.)? Teachers will be evaluated biannually through NEPF and will attend feedback conferences from administration. In support, we will hire subs to relieve classroom teachers for peer-to-peer observation with Leads. Teachers will meet with the Special Education Director to learn SPED accommodation and modification support in Wednesday PDs. 6) Identify the individuals (or positions) and/or vendors responsible for professional development. 55The people that will be responsible for professional development are the Board members, Principal/Executive Director, Special Education Director, Clinical Director, Office/Operations Manager, general education teachers, special education teachers, EL/TESOL teachers, and UNLV interns. 3.7 S CHOOLCULTURE 1) Describe the culture or ethos of the proposed school. Explain how it will promote a positive academic environment and reinforce student intellectual and social development. The principles of our school are holistic education, high academic expectations, and project based learning. Within all of those areas, we will support the vision of all students getting a high level education. Trauma informed instruction and decision making is a major part of ensuring a holistic education for students. UNLV will be a central part of this plan because they will provide professional development and counseling for our students. They will also help with the maintenance of the plan for trauma informed instruction. 2) Explain how you will create and implement this culture for students, teachers, administrators, and parents starting from the first day of school. Describe the plan for assisting students who enter the school mid-year to adapt to the school culture. We will administer the emotional climate of our students and staff through the US Department of Education Climate Tool to assess the culture of the school. DESSA is our evaluative tool to monitor the emotional state and well-being of students, staff, and families because it undergirds the CASEL Framework for social emotional wellness. Teachers will engage in professional development two weeks before students are scheduled to begin. As the students start school on Monday, August 12, 2024, the staff will be demonstrating what they learned in PD. All stakeholders will continually reinforce the plan, purpose, and vision until we can generate a cohesive culture. The PDs we have scheduled include the Youth Mental Health First Aid (YMHFA) on September 9th, 2024, SEAD for SEL 101 to introduce the CASEL Framework, and Restorative SEL to introduce proactive restorative practices on October 7, 2024. Digital SEAD and Center Modules are planned for October 8, 2024. These PDs include the governing board, staff, parents, and teachers, to ensure alignment with the mission and vision of MYBCS as a viable Clinical Model. We will introduce our policies, mission, and vision on the first day of school to all stakeholders and maintain a cultural and emotional check throughout the school year. We will frequently review with all stakeholders, students, parents, administrators, and teachers the MYBCS Mission and Vision Statements. When we hire teachers and administrators, a requirement will be to have the same personal mission and vision closely aligned to human service and the wellness of people. If a student enters the school mid-year, the student will be assimilated into the culture and will have teacher and peer support. New students will have an opportunity to learn cultural expectations through school-wide assemblies and through our system of incentives and rewards. 3) What are the school culture goals? How will you evaluate school culture and the implementation of your culture plan. Our main cultural goal will be to be intentional in providing trauma informed instruction in a safe environment. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion will be a big part of ensuring safety for all stakeholders within our school through summer professional development. We will hold assemblies at the beginning of the school year to talk about the collective values of the school and the expectations for the campus to ensure that students understand their roles, rights, and responsibilities toward establishing and maintaining their culture of calm within the hallways and classrooms. We will use the US Department of Education Climate Tool to ensure that our culture will be serving the needs of our students, teachers, and staff. The data from those assessments are matched to specific scientifically proven guidelines for providing 56needed support. We will also use YouthTruth or the Hope Survey bi-annually as a cross-check on the effectiveness of our school culture. 4) Describe the school's approach to help support all students' social and emotional needs. In order to more precisely manage our responsibility to educate our students we make the meeting of their primary human needs the first order of business, with their secondary and particular needs a close second. Those first two orders of business are the solid foundation upon which we build our rigorous academic instructional program. The so-called \"social and emotional needs'' of all the people in our school are inherently supported through this approach. Using the YouthTruth Student Survey is a technique that ensures that we are successful with our first order of business from the classrooms to the staff rooms and to the board room. We will use our bi-annual YouthTruth surveys or Hope Survey to ensure our order of business is being handled. 5) Discuss any required dress code or uniform policy. MYBCS will be required to wear uniforms. The shirts will brand the MYB logo and the optional shirt colors will be red, white, navy blue, or black. Uniform pants may be either black or khaki in color with black shoes with black shoe strings. Families in need may receive a donated uniform from the school once they show a financial hardship so that uniforms do not create a barrier for the economically disadvantaged student. Parents can fill out a simple document citing financial hardship and may receive a discount or a uniform donation of one uniform per child, per family either all or in part. 3.8 S TUDENTDISCIPLINE 1) Describe the school's discipline policy. If the proposed policy is fully developed, provide as Attachment 4. Discuss the practices the school will use to encourage student to meet school expectations, including restorative justice practices, consequences for infractions, and incentives for positive behavior, as applicable. The discipline policy for MYBCS student behavior is as follows: To encourage our students in the first weeks to buy-in to our culture of calm, the school will host a school-wide assembly for the education about the cultural expectations of social emotional wellness and focus for the school. Students will be introduced to the student discipline policy which will also be found in the student handbook. As part of the restorative justice practices, UNLV will provide one or more therapy sessions to students who may be placed under in-school suspension. They will receive their student work and complete it in isolation from the general population of peers, but as a part of their day they will receive counseling in restorative circles in order to address any behavioral concerns that landed them there. If it involved another student(s), then all students would participate in therapist-led restorative circles to address the social and emotional components. Research shows that restorative circles promote just and equitable relationships and that \"restorative justice circle processes are designed to facilitate relationships in which everyone is treated with worth and dignity, regardless of their race, ethnicity, religion, nationality, ability, ability, economic class, language, body type, gender, or sexual orientation. For example, circle processes allow for everyone in the circle to have the opportunity to speak from their own experience. In the circle, no one is more important than the other and everyone's perspectives are respected. Likewise when emotional harm occurs, restorative conferencing is primarily a space for those harmed to have their needs met; this further ensures upholding the worth and dignity of all. Those causing harm are held accountable and have the opportunity to contribute to the healing process where possible,\" and that \"we develop our potentialities as human beings and enhance our collective well being when our needs are respected, expressed, listened to, defined with care, and ultimately met.\"30 30Evans, Catherine and Vaandering, Dorothy. The Little Book of Restorative Justice in Education: Fostering Responsibility, Healing, and Hope in Schools 572) Explain how the school will ensure that discipline practices do not disproportionately impact certain student populations as well as protect the rights of students with disabilities in disciplinary actions and proceedings, exhausting all options in order to promote the continuation of educational services in the school. The school will ensure that our discipline practices do not impact our students disproportionately by enforcing the Nevada Statutes and codes regarding discipline and potential expulsion of students according to NRS codes 385A.250 under Discipline of Students and NRS 392.466 and 392.467 regarding expulsions. MYBCS seeks to offer a new disciplinary landscape that offers more emotional support for students that may have heightened emotions especially when their behaviors disrupt the learning environment. UNLVs School of Social Work is uniquely imperative to this process because in place of excessive suspensions we will offer therapy whether group or individual to help the student reset in their emotions, think things through, and use the skills taught in SEL classes and in therapy to make things right with the others that may have been affected by the incident. With our intervention of care, the student can return back to the school community of their teachers and peers. The goal is for the progression of disciplinary action combined with therapeutic intervention in order to modify behavioral outcomes. According to Assembly Bill #14 regarding Special Education Students, if a student has a disability and is a Special Education Student, they may be suspended or expelled from the school the same as a general education or gifted student as long as the behavior is not a manifestation of their disability which is verified by the IEP and the Clinical Director. 3) Describe the procedures for due process when a student is suspended or expelled, including a description of the appeal process that the school will employ for students facing expulsion. All students that have committed expellable offenses have a right to due process regarding out of school suspensions and hearings. In the event that a suspension/expulsion may be imminent, an administrator will open an investigation by taking the statement of the student and all parties involved. If enough evidence is in place, we will then make a determination if the consequences are warranted for the accused behavior. In the event of behavior that is against the law, we will seek the expulsion of the student through a Board of Directors hearing, and an Officer(s) will investigate and make a determination of final actions and inform the school of the consequences. For those students that participate in special education and have a disability, the same process applies to them if the disability did not cause the behavior. Due process for out of school suspensions include: (1)frequent warnings and documented behavioral infractions in Infinite Campus, (2)Clinical and administrative interventions, and (3)notification to the parent(s) to come and pick up their child because of suspension. Notification to the parent will include a phone call, an email blast. During out of school suspension, the UNLV clinical team will conduct a well-check visit to the home by UNLV case management if the previous attempts to contact parents were not successful, and also to foster a sense of connectivity for the student. If a student was receiving campus therapy weekly and they are not on campus, therapy will ensue virtually so that there is no break in clinical services. Due process for expulsions include (1)verbal warnings and documentation in Infinite Campus (2)notification to the parent(s) for their decision to participate in a hearing at the school within 24 hours from the date on the last write up in Infinite Campus, (the Executive Director can request an expedited parent meeting), (3)parental response within 24 hours of the original notification, and (4)Board of Directors are notified of the hearing request for expulsion, (5)the Board must meet and set a date for stakeholders to participate in the expulsion hearing, and (6)the Board will come to a final decision with the consultation of the Executive Director. The decision by the Board and the Executive Director is final and binding. In the event that the student was voted to be expelled from MYBCS, the student will not be eligible to return since all previous restoration attempts would have been exhausted. 584) Who will be responsible for implementing the school's discipline policy, including ensuring that accurate disciplinary records are maintained and reported to the SPCSA? The responsible persons to implement school discipline are the teachers, Clinical Director, Executive Director, and the therapists which are critical to the discipline model. The teachers will receive professional development through UNLV as well as from the Clinical Director in order to understand the symptomatology of their student's diagnosis, that is, if they have a Treatment Plan. Teachers will also complete a self-paced Second Step PD that supports our Tier I classroom instruction that will be offered K-8. The Executive Director is the support for all stakeholders and will not necessarily be notified and included in the intervention meetings until and unless a student's behaviors classify as a Major or Urgent incident; or level 3 on the MTSS Behavioral incident chart for Clark County Schools. The discipline records are recorded in Infinite Campus and can be accessed by the teachers, administrators, and the Clinical Director. This ensures that the accuracy of records will be protected and reported to stakeholders and to the SPCSA, because discipline records are kept in the student information system which timestamps and dates all records for accuracy. 5) Describe the school's goals for student behavior. How will the school track discipline data and how will this data be used? Our goal each day is for 100% of students to be in attendance and for 100% of students to maintain strong competencies for social emotional balance in the learning environment. Discipline data is tracked and recorded in Infinite Campus and is readily available for conferences, school level hearings, Board level hearings for expulsion, for PTTCs, and for SPCSA tracking requirements. 3.9 S CHOOLCALENDAR AND SCHEDULE 1) Explain how the proposed school calendar reflects the needs of the student population and the educational model. As Attachment 5, provide the annual academic schedule for the school. The annual academic schedule incorporates 180 days of instruction. The calendar mirrors the Clark County School District calendar to allow for families to take advantage of community-based opportunities like summer day camps. The calendar reflects the needs of the community and allows for summer school opportunities to support the educational model. 2) Describe the structure of the school day and week, including the length of the school day, start times, and dismissal times. Include the number of instructional minutes/hours in a day for core subjects including English language arts, mathematics, science, and social studies. As Attachment 6, provide a draft teacher and student schedule for grade levels served in the first year of operation. MYBCS staff will be contracted to arrive at 7:30am. Breakfast starts at 8am for all students (K-8). School starts at 8:30am for all students. The school day begins with Tier 1 instruction through the teacher-led SEL class for all grades (K-8). This 50-minute instructional block includes the entire campus K-8. Each school day consists of core classes for all grade levels, including specials (Art/Music) or additional therapy sessions separate from the time allotted for Second Step/additional therapy sessions. Core subjects (English, Math, Reading, Science, and Social Studies) instruction is 150 minutes for Kindergarten through second grades, and 200 minutes for grades 3-8. Kindergarten has 235 minutes of instruction, dismissal is at 1:40pm, and there is an option for family therapy in the Kinder grades for their families from 1:45pm-2:25pm. First and second grade consists of 320 minutes of instruction with dismissal at 2:20pm. Third and fourth grade consists of 360 minutes of instruction with dismissal at 3pm. Fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth grade have 355 minutes of instruction with dismissal at 2:55pm. Each grade has 30 minutes for lunch. There are scheduled bathroom breaks for K-4. Grades 5-8 have no specific bathroom schedule. Bathroom breaks will be at the teacher's discretion, and they will use a pass system that includes a sign-out sheet, as long as they do not intersect with the lower elementary 59schedule. There will be an after school clinical option for family therapy set by appointment with UNLV clinical staff and the clinical director. The teachers' school day will be contracted to dismiss at 4pm. Please see Attachment 6 3) Explain why the school's daily and weekly schedule will be optimal for the school model and meet the needs of the student population. The schedule that MYBCS has proposed supports working parents by offering an extended day that includes after school programs and clubs such as Robotics and coding, Mathnasium tutoring groups, health seminars, parent resources, and therapy sessions. Our core classes are requirements of the state of Nevada which are geared toward advancing in higher education. The tenants of the MYBCS program will encourage students to pursue self-determined goals and aspirations. Social emotional tracking supported by UNLV's clinical team works synergistically to assist with learning and gaining lifelong skills through self-regulation which helps to improve academic alignment. We wish to support a least restrictive environment where students can manage their emotions, thoughts, and behaviors along with the support of personalized professional teams such as our PTTCs which are designed to track academic and clinical goals. The social emotional competencies through CASEL and DESSA assessments are designed to foster a growth mindset and spark intellectual curiosity, to teach endurance and perseverance, to raise self-awareness and self-efficacy, to encourage self-regulation, and to improve upon social awareness skills. We host a strong academic foundation that will reflect extraordinary patterns of growth year-over-year. MYBCS will offer superior rates of proficiency compared to local district averages in an effort to promote college awareness and preparedness that would encourage students to understand high value degree choices or a trade as a viable career option. 4) Describe your goal for student attendance and explain how you will ensure high rates of student attendance. Who will be responsible for collecting and monitoring attendance data? What supports will be in place to reduce truancy and chronic absenteeism? Our daily attendance goal is 95%. Attendance is an important part of maintaining a safe place for students and staff because consistency cannot be achieved if students are not consistently present. We will collect all absent data within our student information system. Attendance excellence will be celebrated each day for perfect attendance as a class and marking streaks of perfect attendance for students. Our front office team will call the family of every absent student each day. An attendance ladder of consequences will also be communicated once a student has been marked as habitually absent or having missed more than 5 days in a single quarter. 4 OPERATIONS PLAN 4.1 B OARDGOVERNANCE Questions in this section refer to the governing board of the entity that is proposed to hold the charter as indicated in section 1.2 Applicant Team Information. 1) Describe the primary roles of the governing board and how it will interact with the principal/head of school. Describe any board committees, advisory bodies, or councils to be formed, including the roles and duties of those bodies and how the governing board will interact with these committees, advisory bodies, and/or councils. The MYBCS Board of Directors will operate according to its Bylaws. To ensure effective governance and meaningful oversight of school performance, operations, and finances, the Board has the responsibility for hiring the Executive Director using the New Leaders Principal Evaluation rubric. The yearly evaluation will be conducted using the NEPF for School Administrators. The Executive Director is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the school and will ensure 60that the mission, vision, goals, and outcomes are accomplished. The data regarding such will be reported to the Board quarterly. Special meetings can be held for matters that arise between official meeting dates according to the MYBCS Bylaws. The Board is responsible for the hearings and appeal of expelled students. The Executive Director/Principal will report on the performance progress quarterly. The Board is accountable for the oversight of academic, financial, and organizational functions of MYBCS in full transparency to the community, general public, and in accordance with all authorizer, state, and federal regulations for Nevada. The Board is responsible for resolving appeals and objections in accordance with due process based on severity, escalation, resolution, and appeal. The Executive Director is authorized to attend all meetings pertaining to MYBCS. Board members are encouraged to visit the school campus and give feedback. The MYBCS Board will receive training from BoardOnTrack, a company that oversees the functionality of the Board and offers PD on the domains of effective governance by working with the members of the Board directly as a third party. The MYBCS Board will host a minimum of five members and a maximum of seven members. NRS 388A regulation requires one Board member to be a parent of a student; one who is not a teacher or employee of the proposed charter school to give voice to the parents. Additionally, all meetings will be held in public and will be posted by date and location of the meeting so that the parents and community may participate in Board meetings during public comment. The Board will also evaluate feedback provided by parents through surveys, parent workshops, and advisory committee reports once established. Committees and councils will be formed as the need arises and will encompass 2 Officers. Their rights and responsibilities are outlined in the Bylaws. 2) Explain how the board will evaluate the success of the school. Outline the regular reports that will be provided to the board, their frequency, and who will provide them. This should include financial, operational, and/or or academic reports. What key performance indicators will the board rely on to know if the school is meeting its mission including its academic, financial, and organizational performance goals? The Board will meet 5 times per calendar year and may hold special meetings when emergency issues arise with a minimum of a Quorum. It is the Board's responsibility to evaluate the alignment of the mission, vision, goals, measurable outcomes, policies for academic and financial operation, and approval of contracts. The Executive Director will implement the mission, vision, goals and measurable outcomes at the campus and will share the results of these domains in Board Meetings. During the 5 Board meetings, the Executive Director will present a report on enrollment, attendance, school climate and culture activities, student discipline, therapy hours, professional development, and family involvement activities. Quarterly, the Executive Director will present the student achievement data to the Board and will provide reports on fund raising, recruiting, hiring, training, evaluation, supervision, retention of teachers and support staff, oversight of curriculum fidelity and instruction, facilities management for maintenance and repair, school climate and culture including student attendance, student discipline, student engagement, family relations and partnerships, health and safety of students and staff, committee reports, advisory bodies, community partners, fiscal management of accounts payable and payroll. The Board will review revenues and expenses, transportation costs, facility costs, SMART goals, graduation rates, attendance rates, student-to-teacher ratio, leadership ratio, grants, proficiency rates, staff attendance, staff retention rates, test scores and survey results. 3) Summarize the qualifications and experience of proposed members of the governing board of the school. Identify each proposed board member and describe why they are uniquely qualified to serve on this governing board serving this target community. How will the board ensure that there will be active and effective representation of key stakeholders, including parents? Additionally, complete the Board Membership Template and provide it as Attachment 9. 61Some, but not all of the Committee to Form members may become Board Officers. We will interview for Board positions starting July 1st 2023, and will advertise until May 31, 2024 to ensure that all Board training required prior to being seated are accounted for. Sharon Szeman RN, BSN I got into Nursing to help people and contribute to those who needed help. I've been a nurse for 7 years and have worked at acute hospitals as well as rehabilitation hospitals and home health. I realized I could reach more people with an online business and am pursuing that currently besides working full-time at the Veteran Affairs Hospital in North Las Vegas. My son needed help academically and that is where I found that Mind Your Books would service my area mobile. My son improved tremendously within a few months and I was grateful. When talk arose of a new charter school, I was excited to hear the services offered for children, and I knew it would work because it worked for my son. I had been trying for at least 7 years to get help for my child and the public school system kept letting him fall through the cracks. He also needed help mentally/emotionally, which Mind Your Books was a wonderful program that included mental wellness and academics. I plan to include my diabetes program into the charter school as a student and community resource. It would be a great opportunity to reach children and their families since the disease is increasing exponentially. If we teach children how to be healthy, it will be easier for them as they grow into adulthood. The health of a child is the most important aspect next to education. Ema Rowe I love kids and I am dedicated to children of trauma. I am also a foster mom because I need to protect and educate children, it's a part of my make up and I am excited to be a part of this organization that protects and educates children as well. I am originally from Guatemala and came to the U.S in 2012. I have since worked for mental health agencies for children and I do see a need for such services. I became a certified substitute teacher in 2021, because I wanted to do something to help the kids in my community. I live near the 89110 zip code and I can personally attest to the fact that we need mental health resources and better academics in our neighborhood. My goal was to work for CCSD and help shape the minds of our future generations, but I ended up helping to build something else that I have seen make a difference, even in the life of my own son; and that was through Mind Your Books Education Inc., so a Charter School where we can reach and help more families is ideal. I am glad to be on this team. Through my own parental struggles I was dismayed that my son was not receiving the help he needed from school here in Nevada. I am thrilled to be a part of an organization that takes care of the well being of the whole child with having both therapeutic services and also academics that actually help children to advance through quality programs that focus on the whole child. I look forward to enrolling my own children into the school. Stuart Elzy I have been an educator for over 20 years. I am also a second generation educator. I have a Bachelor's and Master's Degree. I am certified for administration in the State of Nevada. In addition to my academic and experience qualifications, I have been a foster parent for over seven years. I have been fortunate enough to have over 17 children come to my house. I truly understand the needs of all students of various academic backgrounds, especially ones that need a higher level of care and therapy. Janet Staackmann I feel very strongly that all children's needs should be met emotionally as well as academically in a school setting. Children should be respected and have respect for each other in the classroom. I have always wanted a school that meets the needs of children and not just school support but learning mindfulness and kindness helps to create all-encompassing human beings. MYBCS will help students to reach their full humanitarian potential by focusing on the whole child and not just state scores while learning in a safe space. Cheryl Heatley I am a special education teacher in the St. Louis, Missouri area. I have been teaching for 23 years and at the end of May I am retiring. I have a degree in Elementary Education from the University of Central Missouri in Warrensburg, Missouri. I have a Master's in Special Education from the University of Missouri-St. Louis (UMSL) in St. 62Louis, Missouri and a Master's in Administration from Grand Canyon University in Phoenix, Arizona. I wish to serve on the board to help increase the value of education and provide knowledge, insight, wisdom, and dedication. I will proactively collaborate with students and staff to improve policies and processes. I want to be able to assist in making decisions for all students. I am dedicated to enhancing the educational experiences for all students. My job as a board member is to listen and advocate for students, families, and staff. Please see attachment 9 4) How will the board expand and develop over time? If the full founding board has not yet been identified, describe plans and timeline for adding board members and increasing the capacity of the governing board. The full founding Board has not been fully identified at the writing of this application and will not consist of all Committee to Form members. However, when we expand we will seek to include clinicians, STEM experts, and experts with alternative programs such as SPED programs, sports programs, etc. Vacancies for the Board will be filled by vote. The health of the Board will be governed by National Charter Schools Institute (NCSI) who is contracted to manage all components of the Board for MYBCS, its needs, its timelines, and its training, and document processing. We will expand the capacity of the governing Board by electing new officers with skills and track records of success in their respective roles. Board members will complete a background check, sign nondisclosure noncompete documents, receive on-boarding and annual training of fiduciary operations and restrictions, learn Bylaws, Conflict of Interest, Code of Ethics policies, evaluate the Executive Director, review 990 forms from the IRS. MYBCS will adhere to any applicable state and federal laws as they pertain to conflict of interest for non-profit organizations. The Board is strong, committed to the success of MYBCS, and demonstrates the skills and capacity to fulfill the MYBCS mission and measurable outcomes. We will advertise and market for Board Members because we want to increase the strength of the Board and will have the Board positions filled by June of 2024. 5) Explain how the board is or will become representative of the student population and/or the community to be served. How and when will the board engage with the school community and the broader community? The health of the Board will be managed by a third party BoardOnTrack. We will seek to seat in a more diverse Board over time. The engagement with the school community and the broader community is with honesty, integrity, and transparency. There are no prohibited familial relationships nor will there be now or in the future, and neither between charter holders now or in the future, nor are there any members who are within the third degree of consanguinity or affinity nor any supervisory nor business relationships. There is an outlined and reasonable process for resolving student/parent objections. 6) Describe the board's ethical standards and procedures for identifying and addressing conflicts of interest. Provide, as Attachment 10, the board's proposed Bylaws, Code of Ethics, and Conflict of Interest policy. The MYBCS Board's ethical standards and procedures for identifying and addressing conflicts of interest is of highest priority. The Board describes these standards and procedures with direct transparency. Since the Board is running a public, non-profit organization, it is accountable to the stakeholders and will follow the bylaws and policies as written. The Board will identify and address conflicts of interest by ensuring that if a member should be publicly recused under the policies or bylaws, that the member announces this openly in a public meeting. The standard of care will address an actual or perceived conflict. After the Charter is authorized, the Board will approve the proposed Bylaws, Code of Ethics, and Conflict of Interest policies. Any amendments will be incorporated as per the authorization. Annually, the Board will receive training provided by an experienced, third party on their fiduciary duty, Conflict of Interest, Code of Ethics, and evaluation of the Executive Director/Principal. As any new Board member is added, the President and Secretary are 63responsible for securing an onboarding session for the new member to ensure their success, and immediately enrolling them into our platform for Board Professional Development through National Charter School's Institute. Please see Attachment 10. 7) Identify any existing relationships that could pose actual or perceived conflicts if the application is approved; discuss specific steps that the board will take to avoid any actual conflicts and to mitigate perceived conflicts. This information should match the disclosures in the Information Sheets provided for members of the Committee to Form, Board Members of the CMO, Employees of the CMO, and any other proposed governing board members, as applicable. There are no existing relationships now, nor will there be in the future that could pose actual or perceived conflicts according to the Bylaws. The specific steps that the Board will take to avoid any conflicts and to mitigate perceived conflicts are include vetting any new Board member; have them complete nondisclosure, non compete forms; provide on-boarding and annual training on fiduciary duty, Conflict of Interest, Code of Ethics, and evaluation of the Executive Director/Principal; review of transactions or contracts to ensure that no board member may benefit personally from any contract or receive compensation; and implement the policies in order to protect the Charter School. MYBCS adhere to any applicable state and federal laws as they pertain to conflict of interest for non-profit organizations and outlined in the Conflict of Interest Policy. 8) Describe the orientation or training new board members will receive as well as the ongoing development that will be provided to existing board members. What topics will be covered? What is the timeline and expected time commitment? Who will be responsible for providing training to the board? We have an interest in a company that provides training for board members. The topics they cover are helping the school maintain compliance and effective school oversight. They provide a dashboard to track goals, a recruitment plan for bringing on new board members, CEO/Executive Director evaluation tools and meeting management. The commitment is contracted and so their services are optional. The orientation is introductory to their services and how they can assist the school. After comparing options, the Committee to Form selected the National Charter Schools Institute (NCSI) to train our board members for professional development and compliance. NCSI is IACET accredited and emphasizes providing boards with knowledge and skills for effective governance structure. The main components include but are not limited to the roles and responsibilities, student success, insight, strategies, finances, and budgeting. The developers of the training are leading national experts. Their purpose is to \"inspire and democratize excellence in education.\"31The membership is paid yearly and per board the cost is $3,500, which includes up to 30 members per campus, which would encompass the Board of Directors and school leaders. If a board member were to join mid-year, the new member would be required to take specific training with NCSI before being able to be seated as Officer. MYBCS would require all Officers to participate. In the Spring of 2024, we plan to have the board members complete this training which would take approximately 1 week. 9) Explain the process that the school will follow should a parent or student have an objection to a governing board policy or decision, administrative procedure, or practice at the school. The Board will follow the MYBCS policies in regard to handling internal complaints. The process to be followed should a parent or student have an objection to a governing board policy is as follows. The student or parent should seek to resolve the objection at the school level with the teacher or Principal. If this does not resolve the objection then: 1. Collect information from the parent or student regarding the objection 31Board Network - National Charter Schools Institute 642. \"File an Objection\" link that will be on the website 3. The Board calls a meeting to review the objection which may include a review of the Principal Evaluation according to the Standards of the NSPF and the SPCSA Performance Framework 4. Thorough review of the petition and evaluate concerns for adjustment if necessary 5. The Boards decision is final in all matters involving policy, administrative decisions and practices In the event that there is a high risk, high profile legal matter, the Board will provide legal expertise to best direct such sensitive information in effort to protect the student, family, and school. In addition, we would leverage partnerships with local law enforcement and County CPS for direction and next steps in such cases. This will be conducted with all discretion over any sensitive matters. Dr. Harden may serve on the Board after the Committee to Form dissolves and holds the credentials of legal investigator with a Doctorate in Humanities and has held 30 years of experience in investigative matters. 4.2 LEADERSHIP TEAM 1) Provide, as Attachment 11, organizational charts for the school in year one and for when the school reaches full capacity.

The ratio of adults to students in the building is 14:1. 3) Explain how the staffing model described above aligns to the school model and is well suited for the community the school intends to serve. The staffing model aligns to the school model because it is well suited for the community that we wish to serve. It is a Clinical Model and has a strong support in place for the trauma based student and the family with a hardship basis. 4.4 HUMAN RESOURCES 1) Describe your strategy, plans, individuals responsible, and timeline for recruiting and hiring teachers. Explain key selection criteria and any special considerations relevant to your school design. 67The Operations Manager will be responsible for the hiring process. The timeline for recruiting would be January through May. The hiring and onboarding process would be May through July. In the beginning of January, job descriptions will be posted online. By March, pre-screening interviews will begin for candidates. In May, interview selection will begin and conclude by the First of June. Background checks, drug tests, and references will be conducted in June which will solidify and conclude the candidate selection process moving them to onboarding. Candidates must be aligned with MYBCS's mission and vision. 2) Describe your plan to recruit and hire teachers, leadership, and staff who are representative of your student body. MYBCS plans to post jobs on such platforms as indeed and ziprecruiter with the specific details of job expectation duties. In addition, listing all necessary licensing documents and references. We will expand the process to include the diversity that reflects the student population in the community and to include but not limited bi-lingual and English speaking candidates, with proven experience to our demographics of students. MYBCS maintains a working relationship with the University of Las Vegas Nevada and will invite developing teachers to complete their student hours on its campus. These UNLV student candidates will be considered to serve as teachers' aides and earn hours for their licensure upon completion. The hiring process is detailed to include specific steps answered in question 4 of this section. This will cover teachers, leadership, and on-campus staff that will be working with the student population. 3) Describe the school's employment benefits, as well as any incentives or reward structures that may be part of the compensation system. Explain the school's strategy for retaining high-performing teachers. MYBCS has a collaborative working relationship with Distinctive Insurance Brokers. Working together collectively and ensuring that we maximize the best practices associated with the benefits for employment and the PERS retirement. This will include for our paid staff health, vision, and dental benefits. As a member of Nevada State Education Association (NSEA), they offer personal benefits including retirement planning and a home and auto insurance program. In order to retain teachers our first step is to appreciate their efforts, energy and their expertise. This will be accomplished by creative celebrations. MYBCS will take a more concerted approach to make sure all teachers are appreciated and acknowledged. In addition, as the budget allows we will make every effort to provide bonuses, compensation incentives, and as funding increases salary increases for full time staff. 4) State the procedures - including the individual responsible for each step - for hiring and dismissing school personnel, including conducting criminal background checks. Step 1:Interested/qualified candidates review all job postings. The candidate can apply for more than one position. Step 2:Application: The candidate will complete an application, attach a current resume, letter of interest, and three (3) professional letters of reference. All professional licenses will be required to be attached along with a copy of all transcripts and license (if available). Official copies of transcripts and licenses will only be required if a candidate is offered a position. Paper documentation will be accepted, but not encouraged at Step 2. Step 3:Screening Interview: Screening interviews will be required for applicants and potential intern candidates. The screening interview provides the principal a chance to meet and recommend an applicant for a selection interview. The screening interview may be waived when circumstances dictate. Step 4:Selection Interview: The applications are screened by representatives from the board, staff and committee representation. The principal will review available candidate information (letter of interest, resume, professional 68references, online application, transcripts, professional license, and/or screening interview score). Based on this information, the principal will invite candidates for \"team interview\" format at this level. Depending on the number and quality of candidates, additional interviews may be necessary to identify the finalist(s) for recommendation. Step 5:Criminal Background Check; Reference Checks: The school will use a nationally recognized vendor to conduct extensive criminal background checks for potential new hires. The screening includes a multi-state criminal record search, along with a federal criminal background check, as well as a search of the multi-state sex offender registry. If a candidate does not want the board to check references with a specific individual, the applicant is expected to submit this request, in writing, at the time of application. Step 6:Final HR Interview: A final interview will be scheduled with the Human Resource Department prior to making a hiring recommendation. Step 7:Candidates recommended for employment by the Human Resource Personnel must be approved by the Board. A hiring decision is not official until the Board approves the recommendation at the next regularly scheduled Board meeting. Step 8:Employment File: Once a candidate is approved by the Board, an employment file will be created. New hires must have the following items on file: All official college transcripts Appropriate Nevada teaching license (employer's copy) - licensed staff only Clear background check Completion of other required documents The selection process is confidential, to ensure that committee members will speak freely during the selection deliberations, and to ensure all contacted references will provide honest responses. Dismissal Guidance: Staff and or school personnel will be disciplined and dismissed per Nevada Revised Statute NRS 391.750 as the governing document that will give guidance to specific violations and or conduct. According to NRS.391 the guidance from the revised statute clearly identifies procedures that will thoroughly cover the many opportunities that could arise for disciplinary action and dismissal of teachers and staff.32Terminable offenses will be outlined in the Teacher Handbook. 5) Describe the school's performance management system and process for teacher evaluation. Provide your teacher evaluation tool(s) as Attachment 15, as well as any supporting protocols or documentation. MYBCS will utilize the performance management framework called NEPF (Nevada Educator Performance Framework) to align the indicators with best practices, and also as the focal point for Principal Evaluation. Each teacher will meet with the Principal in the first 30 days of the school year to establish their goals for the school year. The Principal will provide frequent, meaningful feedback to teachers as a result of observations and walk-thrus and informally in general forms of support. There will be two formal observations per year, unless a concern is identified which would require an improvement plan and perhaps additional formal observations per year. The teachers will be invited to provide evidence to demonstrate self-reflection, student work, data analysis, and lesson planning which the Principal will take into account in providing the mid-year and final evaluations. The teacher and the Principal will meet to discuss the observed lesson and the written evaluation within 10 days of the formal observation. Please see attachment 15 32NRS391.750 NRS391.755 NRS391.760 NRS391.765 NRS391.770 NRS391.775 696) Explain how the school intends to identify and address unsatisfactory leadership or teacher performance. MYBCS will evaluate its teachers twice a year in the 2nd and 3rd quarter, or under emergent basis in effort to support them and not just highlight shortcomings. MYBCS will identify and address unsatisfactory leadership or teacher performance when the Principal evaluates teachers through the NEPF in focus of connecting new knowledge to prior learning, high cognitive demands for diverse learners, student engagement in discourse and strategy, student engagement in metacognition (thinking about their thinking) to take responsibility for their own learning, and integrating assessment into instruction. The Board will use the New Leaders Principal Evaluation Handbook to evaluate the Principal annually, or as needed, and in focus areas of creating and sustaining a focus on learning, creating and sustaining a culture of continuous improvement, creating and sustaining procedure relationships, and creating and sustaining structures, and to gather evidence through direct observation, indirect practices, artifacts, and school data. MYBCS intends to work with the leader or the teacher to improve their skills, interactions, and outcomes; however, if the performance is not improving after the individual has been placed on an action plan or if the performance is egregious, the individual must be dismissed to protect the integrity of the institution and most importantly, to protect the students. Prior to dismissal, the action plan will consist of goals to meet within a specified timeframe. 7) Will your organization require additional support (from third parties or consultants) for core Human Resources functions (e.g., payroll, benefits administration, employee relations, etc.)? If yes, detail the areas that will require additional support and the costs and criteria for selecting such service providers. If not, provide a detailed description of how and by whom these functions will be managed. MYBCS anticipates requiring additional support for core operations functions by contracting with a back-office support provider. During the application process, MYBCS worked with Charter Impact, Inc. to prepare the application budget. The decision to continue working with Charter Impact will be continued once we are approved. The Principal has the primary responsibility for working directly with and being responsive to the back-office support provider. The Operations/Office Manager has the secondary responsibility for working directly with and being responsive to the back-office support provider. 4.5 STUDENTRECRUITMENT AND ENROLLMENT 1) Explain plans for student recruitment, marketing, and enrollment during the incubation year. a) Describe in detail the recruitment and enrollment strategies that will be used, the timelines for implementing these strategies, and who will be responsible for implementing these strategies? MYBCS will employ the following strategies to recruit and enroll, now and also starting November 1 through March 14 in year 1 and subsequent years. In the incubation year, the Committee to Form is responsible for implementing strategies to recruit and enroll students. The principal and office manager will be responsible for implementing these strategies starting in year 1. Marketing Materials: We will use social media and design flyers and distribute informational materials to appeal to various racial, ethnic, ability, economic, and linguistic groups within the area. Flyers are distributed at nearby apartment complexes, local markets/grocery stores, food banks, coffee shops, libraries, preschools, and businesses. Marketing outreach will occur at group homes and the regional center (Regional Center provides diagnostics and service-coordination for those living with developmental disabilities) meetings and parent support groups for children with disabilities. Marketing outreach will occur at counseling centers. Materials are currently developed in English and Spanish. 70Host Community Events: The Charter School will host 3-5 community events during the 2022-23 school year in preparation for open enrollment. Community events will be scheduled for November through March, including Prospective Parent Nights and school tours. These community events provide families an opportunity to learn about the Charter School and receive answers to various questions. Prospective Parent Nights: The Charter School will host a variety of prospective parent nights which will address the needs of special populations in the community. MYBCS will describe how they can meet the needs of their child with a disability. MYBCS will describe the programs that will help academically low-achieving students through interventions. These meetings may include conversations about uniforms, meals, supplies, and other items that the Charter School will provide. The programs for ELLs and RFEPs are discussed at the Prospective parent events in addition to the interventions provided to students who are academically low achieving. The Charter School discusses the criteria for reclassifying students, continued support, and monitoring for RFEPs, and strategies for LTELs to assist them in reclassification. Advertising: The Charter School will maintain its website (https://www.mindyourbookseducation.org/). The website will be equipped with Google Translate. The Charter School will issue press releases and advertise in local newspapers and publications specific to the target community in English and Spanish. The Charter School is in the process of identifying businesses in the target community where it can hang signs or banners advertising the Charter School. Attend and Establish Presence at Community Events and Businesses: The Charter School will continue to make meaningful efforts to establish visibility in the community. The Charter School team will attend and host community events and visit local parks. The Charter School will set up information tables/booths in high traffic and high visibility areas during well-attended local and regional community events, as well as at local businesses and restaurants. Prior to opening and after approval we will conduct arts & crafts festivals, face painting booths, flag football hosted by the parents, hold fundraisers, and continue to walk the grounds shoulder to shoulder with the people of 89115. Community Organizations: The Charter School is always open to potential partnerships within the local and regional communities inclusive of our community's organizations such as churches, shopping centers, grocers, art organizations, community centers, and the Chamber of Commerce. Social Media and Online Advertising: MYBCS will continue to host social media sites and will continue to stay up to date with social media platforms. Here are some of b) How will you ensure equal access to interested students and families, including families in poverty; students zoned to attend 1- and 2-star schools; students with disabilities; English language learns; and other at-risk students as defined in the SPCSA's Needs Assessment? MYBCS' plan for student recruitment and marketing that will provide equal access to interested students and families compliant with the requirements of R 131. The outreach plan seeks to achieve a balance of racial and ethnic students, socioeconomically disadvantaged students, academically low-achieving students, students with disabilities, ELs and 71RFEPs and other youth at risk of academic failure by creating a school community that reflects the diversity of the general population residing in the 89115 zip code. MYBCS will strive to recruit students from a range of racial, ethnic, linguistic, ability, and socioeconomic backgrounds. MYBCS' commitment to supporting each student individually will encourage families from diverse and multicultural backgrounds who are seeking rigorous academic and social emotional well-being. This commitment will assist in the overall recruiting efforts. The Charter School is committed to designing measurable approaches to underscore the dedication in establishing a diverse student body. The Charter School will maintain an accurate accounting of the balance of racial and ethnic students, socioeconomically disadvantaged students, academically low-achieving students, students with disabilities, ELs and RFEPs and other youth at risk of academic failure students enrolled in the Charter School and will use this information to determine where additional outreach efforts are needed. MYBS will employ the following recruitment and outreach strategies in support of its commitment to ensuring a diverse student population. c) How will you ensure that the school meets at least the minimum enrollment set forth in question 4 below? The re-enrollment (or the number of students returning the following year) rate goal is 85% due to natural matriculation and residential moves and a 13% transiency rate in the schools located in the 89115 zip code. If enrollment falls short, the principal and office manager will use marketing and recruit using the strategies as explained above. If those efforts do not meet the requirements, the board will then be called upon to take action in assisting with these duties. d) What are the marketing, recruitment, and enrollment targets throughout the winter and spring leading up to the first year of operation and who will be responsible for monitoring progress towards these targets? Note that the enrollment audit for new schools which determines initial per pupil funding is conducted on or before June 15 of each year. The Board has collaborated with events in the area near 89115 and will continue to do so to inform and recruit prospective families in the incubation year. In addition, social media platforms have been established with an easy form for prospective families to fill out. We will continue to recruit and market as explained above until we have 1.25 of the enrollment target (225 seats) put forth by the minimum enrollment tables below in question 4 in this section. The Board will monitor the progress in the incubation year and will reach out to these families to have a Q&A with them about the proposed school hoping to recruit and enroll those students. Our enrollment target for the first year is 200 students. In year 1, the Principal will be responsible for monitoring the progress towards these targets. In year 2, the Principal will hand-off this responsibility to the Office/Operations Manager. 2) Describe the application and enrollment process. a) What is the application and enrollment calendar for both the first year of operation and subsequent years of operation? Specify the dates on which the school will begin accepting applications and how long the enrollment window will last prior to conducting a lottery. Please see the table below.November 1 - March 8 Intent to Enroll Forms available at the Proposed MYBCS's website. In subsequent years, forms will also be available in the school office 72March 8 (the second Friday in March) All Intent to Enroll Forms due to MYBCS March 15 (the third Friday of March) Random public lottery conducted, if necessary March 18 (the Monday following, 2 days following the lottery)Admission notification sent to families for enrollment, enrollment packets distributed March 29 (the last Friday of March) Parents inform school of acceptance or declination of enrollment by calling or emailing the school May 24 (the Friday before Memorial Day) Completed enrollment packets due back to the Proposed MYBCS, which includes proof of immunizations or exemption form, proof of residency, and proof of age requirements b) Describe the school's proposed lottery policy including any proposed preferences and/or weights for certain student groups. Every year, students qualify for the school's lottery as long as the seats are full in their respective grade. Although we would not have a weighted lottery, the proposed preferences for a seat would be of the family members of staff and the siblings of enrollees and returning students year-over-year. We would have an online selection process using randomization software. According to Nevada law, any child that lives here can submit an application to attend MYBCS. We do not discriminate on the basis of religion, disability, sexual orientation or gender. Homeless students would by law receive preferential seating. MYBCS will host an equal opportunity application submission based on NRS 388A.453(6) and any child who resides in Nevada may submit an application based on NRS 388A.453(1). Once the seats are filled for each grade level then the online selection process would allow us to admit students randomly through the public lottery in March of 2024. We would have a waitlist for backfill. Within two days of the lottery, the families would be notified by text, call, or email blast based on the contact info collected during the interest phase. Since the lottery is online and will be a randomization software, the parents would not need to physically attend the lottery. c) What systems will you put in place to ensure that staff members are knowledgeable about all legal enrollment requirements pertaining to special populations and the servicing of specific populations of students? All staff, particularly the office staff, will be trained annually and as needed about legal enrollment requirements pertaining to special populations like young Kindergarteners, English Learners, Students with Disabilities, Children of Military Personnel, Homeless, and Foster Youth. They will become experts on these legal enrollment requirements. 3) Describe the student recruitment plan once your school has opened. In what ways will it be different than your pre-opening year, in terms of the strategies, activities, events, persons responsible and milestones? How will the school backfill vacancies in existing grades? What strategies will be used to retain existing students? 73The student recruitment plan will be the same as the incubation year. We will backfill vacancies in existing grades in the same manner as discussed previously through an Intent to Enroll process, filling spaces as they are available and holding a public, random lottery if necessary. Strategies used for retaining existing students will include incentives, rewards, academic growth, and social-emotional growth. We will build a community within the school, build trust with families, have a system of care, engage and partner with parents, quarterly surveys of how the students are feeling through YouthTruth, quarterly surveys for school climate using the U.S. Department of Education's ED School Climate Surveys (EDSCLS), connection programs, wellness programs, help to have students feel enriched outside of the classroom, and become a community hub for the student as well as the entire family to have a sense of belonging. 4) Complete the following tables for the proposed school.

MYBCS is confident that the demand for the Charter School will be high based on the strong academic program and the attention to the students' positive well-being. The rationale for opening K-8 grade levels is based on the current interest of the Charter School in the K-8 program. Parents of current students are not pleased with the middle school options in the community, and they want their children in a small K-8 school rather than in a large middle school. The target population's main needs include reducing chronic absenteeism, improving low ELA and Math achievement rates, and providing effective individualized instruction for educationally disadvantaged students (i.e. students who come from economically disadvantaged families, students with individualized education plans, and English Learners). According to an analysis of the Nevada Report Cards (2020-21) for the elementary and middle schools in the 89115 zip code, an average of 37.81% of the students in the target population were chronically absent, or absent for more than 10% of their enrolled school days compared to 34.3% in Clark County and 31.2% statewide, and only 23.17% of elementary students and 26.07% of middle school students in the target population scored Proficient or better on state-standardized ELA tests, compared to 29% of students in the Clark County School District and 41.95% of students statewide. Similarly, only 11.86% of elementary students and 12.90% of middle school students in the target population scored Proficient or better on state-standardized Math tests, compared to 29.95% of students in the Clark County School District and 26.4% of students statewide. The known organizational and academic challenges that accompany opening multiple grade levels in a start-up environment will be compensated by intense professional development and organizational support from the governing Board. The established goals will help ensure that instructional practices and policies are consistent across grade levels while allowing for differentiated support models to be implemented to allow for individual student achievement. 6) As Attachment 16, provide evidence of demand from prospective students and families within the community you intend to serve as described in the Targeted Plan section. Please see attachment 16 7) Describe how you will maintain engagement with families that have already demonstrated interest (see question 6) through the application window and maximize the number who apply to enroll. Engagement will be maintained by periodic zoom calls, emails, phone calls, social media plugs, and any events being held in or near 89115 in the incubation year. We are still going door and holding community vendors events where we will continue to engage and sign up interested families pre and post approval. Once approved we will continue or even increase the number of engagements with the community. 4.6 INCUBATION YEARDEVELOPMENT 1) Provide a detailed start-up plan for the planning year (the year leading up to the opening of the school) to ensure that the school meets all of the SPCSA's Pre-Opening Requirements and is ready for a successful launch. Using the template provided, outline key activities, responsible parties, and milestones, and submit as Attachment 17 (\"Incubation Year Planning Table\"). Please see Attachment 17. 2) Describe the plans for leadership training and development of the selected school leader during the incubation year prior to school opening and how these plans support your year 0 goals. If partnering with an organization to 75provide training and development, briefly describe the main components of the training program and why that organization was chosen. The committee decided upon the National Association of Elementary School Principals (NAESP) for professional development of the Executive Director/Principal to further their knowledge and skills in the domains of childhood practices, instruction, career building and leadership, evidenced based social-emotional learning, equitable outcomes, diversity, culture, health and wellness, family and community, and strategies for best practices. We would require our Principal to become a member of the Association. NAESP has more than 40 years experience in leadership development. The National Leaders Conference will be held in the spring of 2024, and ideally, all school leaders will attend. The NAESP is hosting a training; Webinar: The Literacy Lever: Every Reader, Every Leader, Whatever It Takes on May 10, 2023 for $50 for non-members. They offer a few different programs including a mentorship. The PD for the will include MTSS Tier 1 Summer workshop August 6th, and 7th, the Model Policy for a Safe and Respectful Learning Environment NRS 388.134 on July 30, 2024, Bullying & Cyberbullying NRS 388.1342 on August 2, 2024, on August 1, 2024, SafeVoice NRS 388.1455.4 on August 2, 2024, Handle With Care NRS 388.1451 on July 30, 2024, School Safety Specialist Training NRS 388.910 on July 31, 2024, Crisis Response and Emergency Training NRS 388.245.4 (h) on July 31, 2024, Suicide Prevention for School resource Officers NRS.2565 on August 5, 2024, Suicide Prevention for Teachers and Students NRS 388.256.2 (c) on August 5, 2024, and Response to Incident on August 1, 2024. The PD we have scheduled includes the Youth Mental Health First Aid (YMHFA) on September 9th, 2024, SEAD is a PD booked for SEL 101 to introduce CASEL on and Restorative SEL to introduce proactive restorative practices on October 7, 2024 and Digital SEAD and Center Modules on October 8, 2024. After comparing options, the Committee to Form selected the National Charter Schools Institute (NCSI) to train our board members for professional development and compliance. NCSI is IACET accredited and emphasizes providing boards with knowledge and skills for effective governance structure. The main components include but are not limited to the roles and responsibilities, student success, insight, strategies, finances, and budgeting. The developers of the training are leading national experts. Their purpose is to \"inspire and democratize excellence in education.\"33The membership is paid yearly and per board the cost is $3,500, which includes up to 30 members per campus, which would encompass the Board of Directors and school leaders. If a board member were to join mid-year, the new member would be required to take specific training with NCSI before being able to be seated as Officer. MYBCS would require all Officers to participate. For personal professional development of our teachers, we will propose they use Touro University and Southern Nevada Regional Professional Development Program (RPDP). Teachers can choose courses related to specific topics that would be beneficial for their licensure and to enhance the teacher's professional career.34Teachers are free to use other PD websites, such as Lead 4 Change and will be encouraged to continue to seek personal growth and to maintain their CEUs for licensure because we hope to work with new teachers and teacher interns. We selected Nevada State Education Association (NSEA) as an additional resource for professional development. NSEA has had 120 years experience and its goals are to \"enhance student learning, provide quality teaching, promote parental involvement, and increase student accountability.\"35As a member of NSEA, they offer personal benefits including retirement planning and a home and auto insurance program. With the training courses of the Professional Learning Board on the NSEA website, a teacher can renew their teaching license.36Teachers can complete paid courses toward the 36Renew a Teaching License by Professional Learning Board35Our Mission, Vision, and Values | Nevada State Education Association (nsea-nv.org)34Touro University Nevada - Touro Nevada andRPDP33Board Network - National Charter Schools Institute 76renewal hours needed and the Professional Learning Board provides a free PD tracker. There is also a free PD course for recognizing child trafficking and child abuse on the NSEA's website.37 School-wide professional development of MYBCS teachers would occur on Wednesdays and this will consist of data analysis, Second Step SEL PD, McGraw-Hill curriculum PD, special education PD with the Director of Special Education and the Clinical Director for understanding our students' diagnosis. 3) Explain who will work on a full-time or part-time basis immediately following approval of this application to lead development of the school(s). Explain who will employ these individuals, describe plans to compensate these individuals, and describe each individual's core responsibilities during the incubation year. Immediately following approval of this application, Cami Taiwo; the Founder of Mind Your Books and Nevada Administrator license #96309 may serve as the school administrator on a full time basis, after stepping down as the Mind Your Books President she will continue to oversee year 0 incubation planning and preparation. Stuart Elzy is a proposed Board member. The core responsibilities would be to oversee the elements of the incubation table according to the timeline, recruit teachers, participate in leadership professional development (cited above) and to continue engaging the community to recruit more students for the lottery and waitlist, and to continue to develop relationships within the 89115 community. The budget reflects the Principal's salary at $85,000. Sharon Szeman will work full time during the incubation year and as needed on any element required in the incubation table to oversee the best practices of the school as it relates to all compliances as a Board Officer. Ema Rowe would be the proposed Treasurer. Janet Staackmann would be the proposed Secretary. No one else on the Committee to Form would be a school employee or Board member. Board and Committee positions are non compensatory. 4.7 SERVICES 1) Describe plans for supporting all operational needs of the school, including but not limited to those services listed below. Explain how any vendors will be selected, evaluated, and held accountable. Explain how you will fund the provision of these services. a) Transportation: Describe your plans for providing student transportation. If the school will not provide transportation, identify how the school will ensure that this does serve as a barrier to enrollment or ongoing attendance. MYBCS plans to have buses that we will petition for a transportation grant or seek donations although we would primarily be a neighborhood school for the bulk of our students. We learned about a transportation grant that will be made available for 2024 from a successful Founder of another Charter school in Nevada. We do not perceive transportation to be a barrier because we will suggest carpooling amongst the parents. As our petition is proposing to open in 89115, that means that MYBCS would be located near multiple apartment complexes thus making access to the school available for many families. Most students would be able to walk to school with some students living in adjacent zip codes with the ability to take public transportation. MYBCS will provide transportation for students whose IEP requires transportation. MYBCS will provide transportation to homeless students who qualify under McKinney-Vento. Due to the high demand for the Charter School in the community, MYBCS is confident that the families will ensure their children attend school every day and on time through family driving or carpools which MYBCS will help to facilitate. MYBCS will monitor the enrollment and accessibility and may determine the transportation needs to be provided. The Board will meet annually to discuss the cost, value, maintenance, and efficient routes once we add bus service. 37Renew a Teaching License by Professional Learning Board 77b) Food Service: Outline your plans for providing food service at the school, including whether and how you will be your own school food authority or will contract with another provider. If the school will not provide food service, identify how the school will ensure that this does serve as a barrier to enrollment or ongoing attendance. We plan to have a commercial kitchen/ cafeteria on campus and to contract with Sysco Foods who will provide breakfast and lunch, and training and certification for the kitchen cook in food safety training, and how to set up the kitchen. Breakfast starts at 8am for the school and they will come in and set up the food and will deliver the food Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday for the week. MYBCS will serve a nutritionally adequate lunch to students, and the Operations Manager will be responsible for keeping accurate records of applications, qualifications, direct certifications, payments, meals served, and ordering for SYSCO. Periodic evaluations will be conducted by the Operations Manager to evaluate and monitor the safety, quality, and cost of this food service, and to evaluate the adherence to Southern Nevada Health District food policy and regulations. The school will apply for CEP status after establishing the base year. This vendor will be funded with the Federal and State reimbursement revenue as the school will have a population exceeding 90% Free and Reduced Lunch students. We will also have Three Square supply after school meals. c) Facilities maintenance (including janitorial and landscape maintenance) We will service the campus grounds by considering the most fiscally conservative vendor of 3 bids when we contract services such as cleaning and janitorial services for landscaping and property management. The Board will meet and decide on the vendors. Annually, the Operations Manager will evaluate the quality of work, costs, length of time to complete the job, and the overall value of these services. Facilities Maintenance will be contracted and is included in the budget at $20,570 which is $2.00 per square foot. d) School health and nursing services: Describe your plans for providing nursing services, including how student required immunizations will be monitored. A full time FASA (First Aid Safety Assistant) is included in the budget, this position will monitor for immunization requirements. A nurse contractor is included in the budget for $5,000 as annual required services (i.e. vision and hearing checks) will be provided as well. The Board has decided to hire AMN Healthcare to supply the school nurse. The Regional Director has been in contact and is preparing for the first school year 2024-2025. Our plan is to contract FASA services for student care, advocate for the health and well being of students, to train and delegate medications and treatments, to educate the staff about the management of illnesses, and attend multidisciplinary team meetings for students with special needs. MYBCS will comply with NAC 391.305, NAC 391.307, and NAC 391.310 for endorsement to serve at a school in Clark County. MYBCS will comply with NRS 392.435 regarding immunizations. Student required immunizations will be monitored by MYBCS in the following manner. Students, guardians, or parents must submit vaccination records to MYBCS before the start of school compliant with the NRS 439.550. MYBCS will generate a report for those students who have not provided documentation for required immunizations. MYBCS will attempt to reach out to families for a request of documentation. Families are allowed to submit a written exemption, if they choose to not have the student vaccinated. If MYBCS has not received documentation for immunizations nor an exemption statement, and previous attempts have not been successful, the student will not be allowed to enter the school nor enroll pursuant with NRS 388.090 until documentation of immunization records, or exemption of immunization has been submitted. If the student is enrolled and a certificate from a physician or health department states the student will be immunized, the student will be placed on a list as conditional. The documentation must be turned in within 90 school days for the student to continue to be enrolled and attend. Prior to December 31, MYBCS will submit a form with the number of students that have been immunized to the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services. The Operations Manager will 78perform evaluations on the nursing service such as cost for value, student outcomes, diagnosis and assessment accuracy, attentiveness, and ability to act swiftly. e) Safety and security (include any plans for onsite security personnel). We plan to hire a campus monitor either part or full time and will also have a security system through a company such as Volta Systems Group and are currently working on an MOU with them. MYBCS will develop the Emergency Management Plan in coordination with local authorities and statutes as required by the State of Nevada (NRS 388.229-266 and 388A.190). The Executive Director/Principal will be primarily responsible for the implementation of the Emergency Management Plan to include conducting monthly emergency drills as per NRS 392. The Operations Manager will be responsible for ensuring attendance at mandated training, practice sessions, and emergency drills. MYBCS will develop the policies and procedures for visitors and volunteers at the Charter School to include sign in and out procedures, visitor badges, live scan and tuberculosis risk assessments. Yearly, the Operations Manager will evaluate the security vendor by cost, outcomes, and analyzing performance indicators such as timely intervention. f) Other services that will be critical to the academics, operations, or financial management of the school. Any needs and services that arise post opening and post approval will be measured against all legalities and Bylaws. The Board will call a meeting to discuss any services that do not meet performance expectations prior to their evaluations and determine a course of action. 2) Outline plans to ensure that the school will have information technology infrastructure, equipment, software, and policies to effectively support the school model and operations. MYBCS is committed to teaching students how to use technology in order to close the digital divide. The technology infrastructure at the Charter School will be developed and installed to the school site at the end of the incubation year. This process will include procuring on onsite server, running fiber optics to the site as part of the service contract with the carrier, installing CAT6 cables in the walls to the access points and compatible with the routers, switches, and server, ensuring secure wireless system, deploying telephonic services, securing a digital cloud backup, installing software to include malware and malice prevention, student online safety systems and firewalls, and academic programs. The classrooms will be equipped with one to one Chromebooks or the like for students in addition to laptops, projectors, and document cameras for teachers. MYBCS will develop technology policies and procedures which will include device management and technology and internet usage agreement included in the Family Handbook. These policies and procedures will be reviewed by an attorney experienced in Charter School law and reviewed annually by the Board to ensure the effectiveness of services. The cost of technology infrastructure and devices is included in the Financial Plan Workbook. 3) Describe the systems and procedures that the school will implement in order to ensure data security and privacy in compliance with FERPA and other statutes and regulations that may protect student and/or employee information. $5,500 is budgeted for an alarm security system. Infinite Campus will protect our student information and keep us in compliance with FERPA, and Charter Impact will protect our employee information through their payroll and other personal and sensitive data that is federally protected. Our parents will have the right to inspect their child's education record and challenge what they believe to be incorrect. If MYBCS does not amend the records, the parent has a right to a hearing. We will not disclose records unless allowed under certain conditions as listed in all FERPA policy manuals. Parents can opt out of directory disclosure. 79MYBCS will develop policies and procedures on document retention to include clinical services while maintaining student (cumulative, demographic, academic, special education, health, mental health, attendance, and discipline, etc.) and personnel files that follow HIPAA and FERPA and the recent legislation related to the protection of personally identifiable information. These policies and procedures will include policies for data stored on personal and portable devices to minimize theft and inadvertent disclosure and for removal of hard copy data from the office and for access of this data by contract staffing (i.e. psychologist). In the Family Handbook, the parents/guardians will be informed about their rights under HIPAA and FERPA. NRS 385A.800. These policies and procedures will be reviewed by an attorney experienced in Charter School law and reviewed annually by the Board to ensure the effectiveness of services. Student and personal files will be stored digitally in secured, access granted systems (user access control) for student information (Infinite Campus) and for personnel information, and for mental health records (Therapy Notes) for HIPAA compliant document storage, and where which the Clinical Director, LCSWs and UNLV interns can render Teletherapy if a student is in the height of symptomatology and cannot be present for in person sessions, a virtual one can be rendered within compliance. Both the student information and mental health records systems will have fire walls, malware and malicious software prevention and removal capacities to prevent the information from being hacked. The digital data will be backed up on the onsite server daily and on the secured cloud weekly to facilitate recovery in case of disaster or destruction. Moreover, all paper documents will be stored in a fire safe, locked file cabinet onsite for the current year, then stored in a secured, accessible location for the duration of the retention period. Additionally, mental health records, and MYBCS financial documents: invoices, receipts, bank statements, payroll registers, audits, etc. will be stored in alignment with the document retention policies established. Paper documents of mental health records will be stored behind two locks. (1)in a locked file cabinet and (2)behind a locked door (office/closet) and will require the approval and signature of the Executive Director and/or the Clinical Director for access by Contract Staffing. A signature sheet to track any removal, faxing, transmitting, or movement of all mental health records will be under the direction of the Clinical Director in conjunction with UNLVs School of Social Work. The Clinical Director will be responsible for maintaining HIPAA compliant data regarding mental health records and mental health information of students, and will be audited by the Clinical Director under the supervision of UNLVs School of Social Work. Appropriate staff will be trained annually on the policies and procedures to include user access control policies to include limitation and termination of rights to access upon departure of an employee. The training will include an evaluation of current policies and procedures, effectiveness of systems, breaches and threats to the systems, and thoroughness of the training. These results will be shared with the Board annually. 4.8 FACILITIES 1) Describe the facility needs of the proposed school for year one and at capacity, including any unique features necessary to implement the school design and academic program including: a) The desired location of the school facility. The desired location and proposed zip code is 89115. We do not yet have an address, but we are seeking. Michael Hiltz of Corcoran Global Living Commercial Realtors has introduced us to a building located at 4884 Lake Mead BLVD, but we do not have an MOU yet for it nor an LOI. b) The number of general education classrooms required each year. 9 classrooms annually c) Any additional classroom space required for special education or EL services, labs, specialty classes and intervention or enrichment programs. 803 therapy offices, a health office, front office, and conference room, 2 SPED rooms d) Space requirements for administrative functions, food services and physical education. Main office, conference room, health office, functional kitchen and cafeteria that could double as a PE space 2)If a facility is not yet identified, or if the identified facility will not meet the school's needs long-term , describe the organization's approach to finding a suitable facility, including progress to date, timeline for selecting and preparing the facility (including development and renovation, if applicable), partners, and any evidence that supports the credibility of the plan. Include the organization's plans to finance the facility, including: a) Total project cost b) Financing and financing assumptions c) Total facility costs that the financial model can handle - debt service + lease + maintenance + utilities + etc. -AND/OR- If a facility, including either a short- or long-term facility has been identified, provide evidence, such as a lease, MOU, or Letter of Intent, and other applicable information regarding the identified facility as Attachment 18. Briefly describe the facility, including location, size, and amenities. Explain how the facility meets or will be modified to meet the needs previously described. If construction, renovation, and/or tenant improvements are required provide a schedule and timeline as Attachment 19. Note that charter schools must demonstrate that a facility has been inspected and meets requirements of any applicable building codes, codes for the prevention of fire, and codes pertaining to safety, health, and sanitation 30 days before the first day of school 14F38. MYBCS has begun the process of seeking a suitable facility in the identified area. This has included meeting with a commercial real estate broker. MYBCS understands that securing a facility to accommodate enrollment is the highest priority and this work will continue with a goal of having a letter of intent ready to sign once the charter is approved. 3) Describe the Committee to Form's or CMO's capacity and experience in facilities acquisition and management, including managing build-out and/or renovations, as applicable. None of the current committee has experience in this area, but MYBCS will work with a broker (Michael Hiltz has been contacted for this purpose) or an asset management company such as Red Hook depending on the final facility decision. 4) Explain the organization's plan to maintain the facility. Maintenance costs are budgeted as part of the facilities expenses based on expected square footage. 5) Describe timelines and plans for ensuring that the facility (whether identified or not) will have proper permitting to operate as a school. Explain the applicant team's interactions with the local jurisdiction to date and plans for future engagement, including the applicable planning department/division and traffic department/division. If the applicant has approval from the local jurisdiction for the proposed location, provide that as part of Attachment 20. MYBCS is planning to lease an existing facility in the area targeted. Permits will be obtained if tenant improvements are required for occupancy. With that in mind, this process will begin the moment the charter is approved. 38NRS 388A.360(1) 816) Provide, as Attachment 21, a list of the types of insurance coverage the school will secure, including a description of the levels of coverage. Types of insurance should include workers' compensation, liability insurance for staff and students, indemnity, directors and officers, automobile, and any others required by Nevada law or regulation 15F39. See attachment 21 5 FINANCIAL PLAN 1) Describe the systems and processes by which the school will manage accounting, purchasing, payroll, and audits. Specify any administrative services expected to be contracted for the school and describe the selection process and criteria for the selection of these contractors. This will be handled by a third party provider such as Charter Impact and has been included in the MYBCS budget. 2) Public charter schools in Nevada are required to conduct an annual financial audit 16F40. Describe the annual audit of the financial and administrative operations of the school. Discuss the planned financial controls and their implementation plans. Include evidence that the school will adhere to the accounting, auditing, and reporting procedures and requirements that apply to public schools operating in Nevada. This will be managed by a third party provider such as Charter Impact. MYBCS Policies will be put in place that align with the SPCSA's recommended financial policies and procedures for charter schools in Nevada. 3) Discuss in detail the school's contingency plan to meet financial needs and ensure the success of the school if revenues are lower than anticipated. Factoring receivables is part of our contingency plan if revenues are short of our fundraising target. The CSP Opportunity 180 grant is also a part of that plan because we will apply for startup school funding to help secure financing. ALso, if the governor's current proposed budget is passed, there will be no need for fundraising. 4) As Attachment 22, present a budget narrative including a detailed description of assumptions and revenue estimates, including but not limited to the basis for revenue projections, staffing levels, and costs. The narrative should specifically address the degree to which the school budget will rely on variable income (e.g., grants, donations, fundraising, etc.). Include the following: a) Per-Pupil Revenue: Use the figures provided by the SPCSA within the Financial Plan workbook. b) Anticipated Funding Sources: Indicate the amount and sources of funds, property or other resources expected to be available through banks, lending institutions, corporations, foundations, grants, etc. Note which are secured and which are anticipated and include evidence of commitment for any funds on which the school's core operation depends. If corporate, foundation, or other entity or individual fundraising revenues are included at $5,000 or more in any year, include as Attachment 23 a copy of any conditional or other commitment letter(s) to support the amount assumed in the budget. Designate in the narrative how much of the anticipated funds may be restricted, such as for a sports field or art equipment. c) Anticipated Expenditures: Detail the personnel and operating costs assumptions that support the financial plan, including references to quotes received and the source of any data provided by existing charter 40NAC 387.77539NAC 388A.140 andNAC 388A.190 82school operators in Nevada or other states and required contributions to the Public Employee Retirement System (PERS). Include, for example, anticipated salary ranges for each role identified. d) Applicants that choose to project revenue from Federal Title Programs (I-IV), Federal IDEA, state special education, and state weighted funding streams should include information in their budget narrative regarding: The projected number of students in each applicable subgroup and how this number was determined, How the school will ensure federal grant funds, state weighted funds, and state special education funds are used in alignment with applicable requirements (ex. Allowable and reasonable expenses, supplement vs. supplant), and How the school will adapt if the student population is different than the projection and/or if the per-pupil allocation is different than anticipated. State special education and weighted funding are based on validated prior year enrollment counts; new schools in the first year of operation do not receive these funds. See attachment 22 5)Submit the completed Financial Plan Workbook for the proposed school as Attachment 24. In developing the budget, ensure that the school does not appropriate for any fund any amount in excess of the budget resources of that fund (in any single year) 17F41. See attachment 24 41NAC 388A.730(2) 837 COMPLETENESS CHECKLIST42 This section is to be completed by SPCSA staff. Applicants should refer to this section to ensure that they have met all submission requirements. In the event that an application is found to be incomplete, the applicant will be notified and provided with approximately two business days to provide the missing information. To the extent that a specific section does not apply to a proposed school (e.g., an elementary school will not offer dual credit), the application should state the reasons that the section is not applicable. Applicants must use SPCSA templates where specified. The completeness check is NOT intended to be a qualitative review of the charter school proposal. The completeness check is ONLY intended to ensure that the charter school proposal, as presented, complies with certain statutes and regulations, and includes all required narrative sections and attachments.

In accordance with NAC 389.445, mastery of learning is dependent upon the success of certain factors such as attendance, meeting reading levels, and passing grades in core subjects according to grade level Standards. K-8 Attendance Retention No more than 15 days of unexcused absences for the school year K-5 Grade Promotion *Demonstrate 1.25 years of growth in each subject area according to grade level Standard *\"Meets\" ELA, Math Science, Social Studies *Less than 15 days unexcused absence 6-8th Grade Promotion *Demonstrate 1.25 years of growth in each subject area according to grade level Standard *English 1 \u00bd credit *Math 1 \u00bd credit *Science - 1 cre dit *Social studies 1 credit *For 8th: Pass all core classes during the seventh and eighth grades in order to be promoted to high school by 70% or greater. *Less than 15 days unexcused absences \"Meets\" ELA, Math Science, Social Studies F&P (Fountas & Pin ell) Benchmark Assessment System (K -8 Requirements) A Comprehensive reading readiness assessment to determine readiness for reading and instructional levels *Grow a minimum of 3 levels on F&P OR *Reach grade level 8th Grade Retention & Exceptions If an eighth grade student does not meet the requirements, the student may be retained the following school year in eighth grade. An exception to 8th grade retention would be to place the student on academic probation with promotion to high school as long as th e student meets the criteria. The criteria for academic probation is as follows: (1) the student needs \u00bd credit in one of the core classes, (2) the student meets or exceeds CRT scores needed for the credit deficiency, and (3) the student reaches 16 89years o f age at the start of the school year or during. Remedial instruction will take place in the core class where credit is needed during the ninth grade. If the student receives a passing grade, the probation will be removed. If a parent elects not to have th e student on academic probation, the student will be retained in eighth grade the following school year. Students in special education may be promoted to high school if the student meets the requirements of the IEP in place. Promotion MYBCS teachers must c omplete a three -year academic plan for all students in the sixth grade that includes specific academic goals for the student to achieve by eighth grade. The academic plan will be reviewed yearly and will be revised if necessary. Retention MYBCS will assess and evaluate students in Kindergarten, third, fifth, and eighth grades for retention and must offer every available intervention before a student is retained. Teachers are to inform the Principal immediately of any student falling behind, more than 10 absences in a school year, or at -risk for retention. Students who are at -risk for retention will be included in a conference with the Principal, parent, teacher(s), and therapist to determine the best interventions for meeting the requiremen ts at MYBCS. Teachers will monitor the student and inform all parties of progress or will inform the Principal if the student is not meeting the goals outlined in the first conference. The Principal and the teacher in agreement, will have the final decisio n to retain a student. Transfer Students The Principal will evaluate the credits earned from the previous school, during the school year or in summer school, and/or state required scores, where the student resided, for students transferring to MYBCS duri ng the seventh and eighth grade school years. If the Principal finds the student to be at -risk, a conference will be arranged with the parent and student to discuss options offered at MYBCS. 9091 Service LICENSURE & CERTIFICATION : State of Nevada License for Educational Personnel K -8 Professional/Elementary (2018 Obtained) State of Nevada License for Educational Personnel: Professional/Special Education/School Administrator State of Nevada License for Educational Personnel: Elementary K -8 (2012 Obtained ) ISBE Approved Certification Program in Partnership with Chicago Public Schools for NCLB Initiatives Certified as \" Highly Qualified \" under the No Child Left Behind Act /Illinois Statute Type 22 Initial Alternative Elementary Teaching Certificate: 2007 Obtained Type 23 Provisional Alternative Elementary Certificate: 2006 Obtained Endorsements : General Education, All Elementary, Science, Special Education, General, Gifted Building Principal and Administrator EDUCATION Roosevelt University -Bachelor of Science in Biology , Chicago, Illinois , 2000 Dominican University - Masters in Teaching, Riverside , Illinois , 2008 Concordia University -Masters in Educational Leadership , Riverside , Illinois , 2012 Sierra Nevada College - Administration Endorsement , Building Principal 200+ Internship Hours , 2018 PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE Mind Your Books Proposed Charter School (2023 -2024 SY ) Founder and Official Trustee President Charter Authority meetings and trainings for school setup (Ongoing) Opportunity 180 Fellowship Leadership Competency Training (J an 2022) Mind Your Books Education, Inc .

We initiated our business relationship so Ms. Ta iwo could refer her students that needed additional math education to our organization. We both are focused on making sure that students that are having difficulty with their current math education get the support to remediate the foundational gaps in math ematics. I am the co -owner of seven Mathnasium locations here in the Las Vegas Valley. The program that Ms. Taiwo is proposing will provide academic, social and emotional support to at -risk students in K -8th grade. Mathnasium serves as supplemental math education and remediation support for students in grades K -12. By offering Mathnasium support for her students that have the highest amount of math deficits, Ms. Taiwo in partnership with Mathnasium, understands the despair students feel when they have the inability to master basic concepts and how incredibly important it is for students to have foundation mathematical skills before they can move forward with more complex mathematical concepts. By understanding how this aspect of education impacts student c onfidence she is providing the social -emotional wrap -around student support that is vital for at -risk students in our community. We are both excited by the prospect of supporting students and being able to provide supplemental services for Mind Your Books Charter School. There are limited options for at -risk K -8th grade students in Clark County, yet there is a tremendous need for this type of program. Once MYBCS is approved, Mathnasium is proposing to support the students and their families in the followin g ways: Hosting Math Family Game Nights Offering after school individualized math enrichment for struggling students. Many at -risk students, today, could have greatly benefitted from a program like Mind Your Books is proposing. Early identification and intervention for students facing academic, social and emotional challenges is critical to preventing students from making poor decisions and dropping out of school. I appreciate your consideration of Mind Your Books charter school application. Please let me know if you have questions or concerns.

MYBCS seeks to offer a new landscape that offer s more emotional support for students that may have heightened emotions, especially when their behaviors disrupt the learning environment. UNLVs School of Social Work is uniquely imperative to this process because in place of excessive suspensions we will offer therapy, whether group or individual, to help the student reset their emotions and make things right with the peers that may have been affected. With our intervention of care, the student can return back to the school community of their teachers and peers. The goal is for the progression of disciplinary action to modify behavioral outcomes through the UNLV clinical team and through therapeutic intervention. Minor Infractions & Classroom Management The teacher manages Minor behavioral infractions thro ugh classroom management as expectations set forth in the first few weeks of school. These expectations are enforced and practiced throughout the entire year until they become classroom habits and expectations for the students. Classroom management is para mount to fostering a least restrictive learning environment and is critical to the school's culture of calm. When Minor Infractions occur, the teacher can issue a verbal warning to the student by restating the classroom or common area behavioral expectations in effort to redirect the student's behavior. The teacher may call the student's parent as an option; however, verbal warnings will be recorded in Infinite Campus as documented behavior of a minor incident. After the 4th Minor infraction such as excess ive talking, or consistently breaking classroom rules established by the teacher, then the student will be placed on the next tier in the MTSS incident flowchart. Minor/Major Infractions & Due Process for In school Suspension Minor/Major violations are disruptive to the learning environment and overturns classroom rules and the rules of the common areas of the school such as the hallways, playground, or the cafeteria. These infractions are recorded in Infinite Campus as behavioral documentation, and adm inistration will be notified. Parents will be notified by the teacher. The student will be escorted from class and sent to the office where support is given to the teacher through administrative backup. A therapy intern or administrator will speak to the s tudent, redirect them, and afterwards the student will be sent back to class. In school suspension may be required to ensure the student is not suffering silently from something troubling them and catalyzing the disruptive behaviors. Due process for in sch ool suspension (1) 3 Verbal warnings documented in Infinite Campus (2) parent notification, ( 3) student -teacher conference (4)individual therapy session. After the 4th Major/Minor infraction, the student moves into the Major level of the discipline model. 182Major Infractions, Therapeutic Intervention & Due Process for Out of School Suspension Student behavioral violations at the Major infraction level exhibit behaviors that go against school policy and not just classroom management rules. These behaviors may impact student and staff safety. The behaviors at this level may cause property damage, and will require parent interaction, therapeutic intervention, and administrative attention. The campus monitor may be required to remove the student from the immed iate environment. These major behaviors are also recorded in Infinite Campus for data tracking. According to the MTSS incident flowchart, after the 4th Major infraction, the student becomes an urgency to the campus, and prior to any subsequent incidents, a ll campus resources will have been exhausted including clinical intervention and a possible mental health assessment by the Clinical Director, LCSW. Depending on the severity of the 4th infraction, or if the student commits a 5th infraction, then the stude nt will be suspended out of school for 3 -5 days and a mental health assessment will be conducted off -site. Depending on the severity of the infraction, the behaviors at the Major Infraction level could possibly , but does not always lead up to expulsion of the student from the school. Potential expulsions will be discussed at the school level and does not include the parent or the student, but provides a space where the stakeholders at the school can compile discipline and academic data to get a full picture of the student's campus behaviors. Due process for out of school suspensions include: (1) frequent warnings and documented behavioral infractions in Infinite Campus, (2) Clinical and administrative interventions, and (3) notification to the parent(s) to c ome and pick up their child because of suspension. Notification to the parent will include a phone call, an email blast. During an out of school suspension, the UNLV clinical team will conduct a well -check visit to the home by UNLV case management if the prev ious attempts to contact parents were not successful, and to foster a sense of connectivity for the student. If a student was receiving campus therapy weekly and they are not on campus, therapy will ensue virtually so that there is no break in clinica l services. Urgent Infractions, Out of School Suspensions, School Level Hearings, Board Level Hearings, & Due Process for Expulsions Urgent behaviors may include, but may not be limited to weapons, sexual assault, battery, life -threats such as threat of violence and harm to others with evidence of a plan in place, drug or alcohol use or possession, violence, or threat of violence toward the school campus, destruction of school property, or illegal activity. All urgent incidents will be immediately reported to the office and will have an immediate response from the administration . These incidents may likely require expulsion, restorative justice, law enforcement involvement, securing the area, and escorting parties for the safety of others. Incidents will be log ged into Infinite Campus. Administration will follow the rules and regulations of the state legislature NRS 392.466 and 392.467. Students will be suspended out of school pending expulsion if the expulsion has been decided upon at the school level hearing. Due process for expulsions include (1) verbal warnings and documentation in Infinite Campus (2) notification to the parent(s) for their decision to participate in a hearing at the school within 24 hours from the date on the last write up in Infinite Camp us, (the Executive Director can request an expedited parent meeting), (3) parental response within 24 hours of the original notification, and (4) Board of Directors are notified of the hearing request for expulsion, (5) the Board must meet and set a date f or stakeholders to participate in the expulsion hearing, and (6) the Board will come to a final decision with 183the consultation of the Executive Director. The decision by the Board and the Executive Director is final and binding. In the event that the stude nt was voted to be expelled from MYBCS, the student will not be eligible to return since all previous restoration attempts would have been exhausted. 184185Mind Your Books

Its purpose is to supplement t he Conflict of Interest Disclosure Code as adopted to ensure compliance and adherence to the laws and expectations of the Political Reform Act Terms Persons: Director, Officer, staff, employee, personnel committee members with powers of the Board, anyone with direct or indirect financial interest, family members, and spouses of, upper management Organization: MYBCS, MYB, Charter School, the school, Mind Your Books Charter School Financial or Fiduciary Interests: Any person with a financial interest direc tly or indirectly, ownership investments, transactions and agreements, compensation arrangements, negotiations, receiving compensation from the organization for services rendered within 12 months previous, independent contractors, entities or individuals n egotiating transaction arrangements gifts and favors of substantial nature. Procedures Disclosure: any interested person must disclose possible or literal conflict of interest and should disclose any financial interest and facts to the Board and committee members considering any and all proposed financial opportunity Addressing the Procedures for Interest Conflicts When a decision is based on financial interest, written disclosure should be made to the immediate upper management or to the immediate supervisor , and if an intere sted party who is not a Board Director decides that they should not make a decision based on financial interest , then u pper management should reassign the matter at hand to another employee and forward the disclosure notice to the Executive Directo r/Principal who documents t he employee 's disqualification status. If the interested person is the head of an agency , then the disclosure should be made in writing to the Board of Directors. Interested Persons as Directors No one serving on the Board should be an be an interested pers on and if the Board member's financial interest comes into play after the member has been elected then according to Government Code Sections 1091 or 1091.5, the Board should not enter into the agreement because the Government Code Section 1090 prevents the Board as a whole from voting on said contract, or if partaking in such, the Board member must resign and this will be on their official record . 213Violations of the Conflict Policy If the interested person fails to disclose to the Board of Direct ors the literal and possible conflicts of interest then the person shall be afforded an opportunity to explain their action. If investigation warrants anything further such as the deliberate failure of the interested person to disclose, then appropriate disciplinar y and corrective action will be taken which may include removal and an immediate exit of all duties of Board membership, rights, and privileges. Termination would be immediate and the transaction would be nullified and voided by the courts, and the con tract that stood in violation of the Government Code section 1090 would become voided rendering it powerless to harm the organization. Records of Proceeding Regarding the Board and all committees with Board powers, the minutes should include the disclosing person's names of all who are connected to the financial interest, the nature of the interest and all actions taken, the names of these persons present for voting related to the transaction, what they talked about, and any record of votes connected to the event . Annual Statements Yearly, all Directors and officer s and committee members should sign a statement affirming the receipt of the Conflict Policy after having read it, and after having agreed to comply with the contents therein, in order to acknowledge that a charter school; namely MYBCS, is a nonprofit public benefit organization which operates as a public school and that to maintain its 501c3 status it must engage in the practices of one or more of its tax-exempt purposes. Periodic Review To guarantee that the school operates in accordance with the charitable purposes of, and does not engage in any activities that may jeopardize its tax-exempt status, then reviews will be conducted periodically. The Code of Conflict policy will be reviewed yearly by the Board of Directors, and by each of its members an y all changes to the policy will be communicated right away to all interested persons. . 214 215MIND YOUR BOOKS CHARTER SCHOOL ORGANIZATIONAL CHART : YEAR 1 Board Principal Office/Operations Manager School Operations Support StaffCampus Monitor FASAClinical Director/LCSW UNLV Mental Health InternSpecial Specials UNLV Teacher InternsTeacher's Aide/Assistants 216MIND YOUR BOOKS CHARTER SCHOOL ORGANIZATIONAL CHART: FULL CAPACITY Board Principal Office/Operations Manager School Operations Support StaffCampus Monitor FASAClinical Director/LCSW UNLV Mental Health InternSpecial Education Director Special Education cami@mindyourbookseducation.com Vegas, Nevada, 89113 702-772-9604 (Cell) 702-761-6567 ext. 1 Mind Your Books Education, Inc .

The financial statements include a 6-year pro -forma annual budget and monthly cash flow statement ( the planning year pl us 6 years of operations for 2023-24 through 202 9-2030 inclusive ). Students: Enrollment, Demographics and Average Daily Attendance Revenues for Mind Your Books Charter School will largely depend on the number of students enrolled or Averag e Daily Enrolled (ADE). It is planned that Mind Your Books Charter School will open in 20 24-25 with enrollment of 200 ADE and grow to 280 ADE at capacity . The following table shows MYBCS projected enrollment . Table A: Enrollme nt 311Revenues Factoring in all reven ues at the school, per -pupil funding is expected to be around $11,000 /ADA at MYBCS except in the early/initial, start -up year when some revenue streams are not immediately available . State revenue streams provide the largest source of funding, making up about 84% of MYBCS total revenues beginning in Year 2 of operation . All revenues are monitored throughout the year as various funding estimat es are refined and recalculated. Table B: Summary of Projected Revenues State Revenues State Revenues are estimated based on specific programs as identified below, with the majority of funding dependent upon the annual S tate budget and the school's student population. Pupil Centered Funding Plan (PCFP) The New School Application Funding Plan Template (The SPCSA Funding Model) provided by the State Public Charte r School Authority (SPCSA) was used to d etermine the PCFP projections for each year of the above revenue projections which are paid in Year 1 at $7,293 per expected student AD E and the expected weighted population count of students at MYBCS of 90% Free and Reduced Lunch Tale nted Students . For Special Education Students 12% is calculated as the population percentage based on Clark C ounty 's population . These estimates are consistent with the demographics of the zip code . These projections show that in year 1, a total of $1,458 ,600 will b e paid out based on the proje cted ADE. In Year 2, a conse rvative 1.5% COLA is applied to the PCFP and i n add ition , weighted funding will begin to be paid out totaling $213, 403 along with the projected ADE payout of $1,817,863. Going forwa rd these nu mbers will increase based on added enrollme nt an d the COLA incre ase calculated conservativel y at 1. 50% per annum . It should be noted that a 1.25% PCFP Sponsorship fee is deduc ted from the se amo unts each year. Table C: Projected State Revenues 312Federal Revenues & Other Funding Special Edu cation MYBCS provides Special Education services and will work with local Special Education providers to ensure compliant services are provided , and efficient and effective delivery of s ervices. MYBCS State Special Education funding includes general state funding of $3,694.00 per Special Education Student as projected i n the SPCSA funding model . In addition to state special education funding, the revenue projectio n for MYBCS also assumes $3,000 per Special Education student of IDEA Federal Special Education funding beginning in year 2 per the SPCSA model . Free and Reduced -Price Meal Eligibility The federally funded National School Lunch Program provides free and reduced -price meals for lunch and breakfast to eligibl e students, based on parent/guardian income levels. For this budget, we assume that the percentag e of our students eligible to receive federal funding reimbursements will be about 90%. Additional receipts from paid student meals have not been included for conservatism since we do not have historica l information. Food expenses for this program are show n below; serving staff expenses are included in classified salaries and benefits. Title Programs Based on roughly 90% of students qualifying for free and reduc ed prices meals, MYBCS has also included Title funds at rates projected in the SPCSA funding Model and based o n the per centages of the weighted populations in the chosen area code and in line with the local School Distri ct- Clark County School District (CCSD .) Other Revenues MYBCS is projecting $250,000 in fundraising in the first year of oper ations . This is based o n lette rs that have been collected to date that total approximately $ 30,000 with one more year to secure the additional assumptions . Additionally , MYBCS is currently in contact with m ultiple businesses that have expressed a str ong interest in funding MYBCS 's start up , but due to a compressed timeframe, MYCBS has no t been able to get a written comm itment in time for petition submission . However, reaching the funding target by year 1 is believed to be reaso nable at this stage . Table D: Projected Federal Revenues & Other Funding 313 Expenditures The pr ojected expenditures through 2029-30 are shown below and are followed by a su mmary of assumptions for some of the larger expenses. Table E: Summary of Projected Expenses Total Compensation - Salaries and Employee Benefits Total compensation costs (salary and benefits) at capacity remain relatively constant near 65% of total expe nditures after year 1 . \"Com pensation\" includes the salary costs of all staff, including those who work full -time and part -time , and includes all staff benefits including social s ecurity, Medicare, and workers' compensation. MYBCS 's teacher staffing levels are based up on enrollment p rojections. Ratios of Certificated Teachers to Students are expected to be at or below 28:1 over the course of the full 6 years of operations . However, that ratio is slightly below 14:1 or below after year 1 when including all staff who are in Student/Pro gram sup port roles. Table F: Instructional Staff Ratio The staffing tables associated with our fi nancial projections are shown below: 314Table G: Staffing Summary For the first year of operations ( 2024-25), it is assumed that the School and Site Directo rs and other 12 - month employees will begin on July 1, 20 23. The average salary structure for key FT E staff positions is listed in the table below . The budget assumes a 3% cost of living adjustment every year . Note that the projected total salary amount s in Tabl e E also includes support staff costs. Table H: Average Budgeted Salary by Position Table I: Employee Benefits The table above lists the total projected annual employer costs for all employee benefits, on a year -by- year basis. Within employee benef its, most benefits are statutory and are determine d by either s tate or federal man date and are based on current rate fa ctors. These benefits d iffer by whether they are full- time, part -time and /or hourly employees . MYBCS employees participate in different comb ination s of 315PERS , Social Securi ty, Medicare, and workers ' com pensation depending on position. For full -time employees , who participate in Nevada PERS (and not in the Federal Social Security system), the employer contr ibution is expected to be 16.5 0% which reflects a blended rate of 50/50 (15.25%) vs. PERS 100 (33.25%) with a clear bias towards PERS 50/50 as most teaching staff in a new charter trend to the younger demo graphic and rema ins flat annually thereafter . General Operating Expenses Many o f the core pr ogramming cost projections after the initial start -up period beginning in Year 1 are based upon a per p upil estimate that is reasonab le for the school size including professional development , office supplies, instructional supplies, textbooks , library book s, online curricula , project materials , field trips, school uniform costs, contracted SPED Services, contracted back-office at 2.5% of revenues , student assessm ents , bank fees, and meeting expense s all included in the Instructional Supplies ex pense line . MYBCS will provide breakfast and lunch for all students and wi ll participate in the Nation al Free and Re duced Lunch Program. Total Contracts and other services include an estimate for legal fees a nd audit fees. Table J: General Operating Expe nses Furni ture , Fixtures, Equipment an d Technology (FFE&T) The purchase of equipment will also be a critic al part of the instructional program. The budget accounts for the purchase of this equipment ( furniture and technology ) per pupil, pe r full -time staff member and general purchases. As these items do wear out over time and need replacement, the budge t accounts for the replacement of requisite devices over time in addition to the initial purcha se in the first year of oper ation. 316 Table K: Furni d Technology (FFE&T) Mark eting Expenses Marketing Expenses are calculated at $5,000 in year 1 and $2,500 there after. Insurance Costs Insurance costs are cal culated at $33,686 in year 1 with a 2% inflation adjustment in subs equent years. 317 Facilities Expenses MYBCS is planning to o ccupy and lease a third -party site . Based on current real estate conditions and the geographic area targeted , the budget is projecting faci lities costs of $10.08 per square foot per year during the first year of operations with a 3% escalator calculated . Per the SPCSA f inancial Funding Model, the calculated square feet required in year 1 will be 11,000 . This w ill increase each year bas ed on the student growth to a total of 15,400 square feet at capacity . This rate ha s been di fficult to nail down and compar atives have been difficult to obtain . This rate represents the lower end of advertised commercial real estate in the same zi p code. Table L: Facilities, Repairs and Other Leases Expenses 318Cash Flow Due to the expected high costs o f starting up a school , MYBCS has targeted philanthropy as a bridge to meet cash fl ow needs in the opening year of $250,000 because of a limited openi ng cash balance starting in Year 1. However, as t he fundraising is not guaranteed past the currentl y confirmed $30,000 it is possible that borrowing will be necessary via factoring portions of the State PCFP receivables at approximately 4 .5% for the amount needed. I t is estimated that approximately $300, 000 will need to be factored if the fund raising target isn't met. Th is would add appro ximately $13,500 to the f irst-year expenses. Additionally , MYBCS will be appl ying for the CSP Opportunity 180 grant that would provide additional funding in the st art-up year if needed a nd will allow for s ome of the assumed costs to be covered such as furniture and curriculu m. As a final thought, if the governor 's proposed budget passe s, the school could get approximately an additional $400,000 in year one. This would offse t any potential fundraising shortfall and les sen the need for factoring . In the 2nd year of operations , the timing of the PCFP payments will be much less of an issue , and minimal factoring would be needed . In addi tion, the year -over -year surpluses will all ow for the schoo l to begin growing a substantial cas h reserve to protect itself against economic uncertainty and other cash flow timing pitfalls. Ending Cash Balance The cash balance at the end of 2024 -25 is projected to be minimal at $13,671 but will gro w from there as the State funding calculations catch up with the school's e nrollment at cap acity. 319Fund Balance The fund balance is expected to be above the State-recommended levels by Year 2 and in each year of operations thereafter and grow to 28.20% by the end of year 6. Table S: Statement of Fund Balance Contin gencies As mentioned previousl y, there are numerous possibilities n ot assumed in this p etition. First, it is likely that the governor 's budget w ill pass very close to what was recomm ended. If not, t here should be a reasonable COLA th at is passed that is safely above what is assumed as a st arting p oint in this petition per the SPCSA financial model which is $7,2 93.00 which is the current rate in FY22 -23. Second, the CSP 180 Charter Sta rtup grant will be applied for which could he lp to fund the school and significantly cover some of the assumed costs w hich will allow the school to reach a healthy endi ng fund balance in year 1. Third , factoring of receivables is a significant possibility in year 1 based on the timing of PCFP payme nts and Federal grants being reimbursement based but is not currently assumed based on the assumed fundraising in year 1 . Howe ver, this is certainly a possibility that w ill be used if the need arises as the relati onship with a le nder has al ready been established with this possib ility in mind. 320 321April 15, 2023 TO: REBECCA FEIDEN Nevada State Public Charter School Authority 1749 N. Stewart Street, Suite 40 Carson City, NV 89706 From: Janet Staackmaan 7815 Kostner Avenue Skokie, Illinois 60076 I am writing this letter in support of MYBCS's commitment to the overall well -being of all children. I am truly impressed with the ideals that are the basis of and wrought into the fabric of the whole system. My prayer is that this will be the first of hun dreds of like schools across the country, the continent and the world. Hopefully, this is the new model upon which all educational environments will be emulated. MYBCS acknowledges that children need to learn not only academics, but they also have the dire need to express their emotions and deal with their feelings in a healthy manner. This will be of major importance in their maturation process for life. We all now know that buried feelings never die. I believe in MYBCS to achieve this all-important missio n especially in these current times. I will personally help with a donation of up to $25,000 so that their goals are accomplished. Thank you. Janet Staackman 847-208-9230 322To Rebecca Feiden Nevada State Public Charter School Authority 1749 N Stewart Street, Suite 40 Carson city, NV 89706 RE: Mind Your Books Charter School Dear Ms Feiden, This letter is written to express my concern and commitment to the community of Las Vegas and that through MYBCS success that it will spread through out not only in Nevada but to other cities and states. I am a mom of 4 grown children. There is a need for a school that will address the emotional and scholastic needs of our children, especially in the early years of school. The MYBCS will provide a therapeutic and health model of education. With the rise of schools senseless violence, and self harm, I beli eve investing in the emotional education of our students early is a wise way to preserve and rescue our children. I am excited that there will be K -8th grade school that will address the developmental needs of our children while ensuring that they are saf e. I am planning on helping MYBCS for the 2024 school year a donation of $5,000.00. After hearing about the goals of this school, I believe in supporting them by sowing the seeds into our children.

Our robotics programs, for kids grades PreK -12, feature curriculum- based social and STEAM learning experiences . Our mission is to inspire young people to become science and technology leaders, by engaging them in exciting mentor -based programs that build sci ence, engineering and technology skills, that inspire innovation, and that foster well -rounded life capabilities including self -confidence, communication, and leadership. As an organization, w e're happy to support Cami Taiwo and her plan t o found the Mind Your Books Charter School (MYBCS) here in Las Vegas. We've known Cami since 201 8 when she was an educator at Rainbow Dreams Academy. Mind Your Books plans to build an alternative charter school learning environment for troubled and at -risk children grades K -8. This is a great need in Clark County: an educational institution that provides support in the classroom and outside of it. As part of our partnership with the T esla education investment and the Nevada Department of E ducation to secure a robotics program in every school in the state, we're a ble to provide access to equipment to ensure public and charter schools have the training and resources needed to start su stainable teams for many years. We work closely with school administration and staff to support robotics programs in every corner of the state, and the program at MYBCS would be no different. After MYBCS is chartered, we look forward to working with Cami and the rest of the institution's staff in building a robust robotics program that can compete with other schools and organizations annually.

We were careful to ensure that they would be already five years old in Kindergarten by 2024, for example we did not sign up any newborns or 1-2 year olds. 89015 3 We knew that the 6th graders would be in the 8th grade by 2024, and so for example if a kid was already in the 7th grade as we were talking to their parents, we knew that they would not qualify because by 2024 they would be in high school and so we did not sign them up. 89032 2 Regarding children getting to school and transportation issues, we have already looked into the cost of renting a van, and perhaps purchasing one. We assume that we would be able to afford a van with the increase in per pupil funding. Also many parent outside of the 89115 area drive and we asked them if they were mobile. They are interested in the model and feel it is worth the drive. 89118 1 89130 3 89052 1 89143 1 89081 4 89102 1 89128 1 TOTAL 200 "}
