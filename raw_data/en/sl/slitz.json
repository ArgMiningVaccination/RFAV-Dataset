Remember that the medical community did not know anything about this virus until just 3 years ago. There is a tremendous amount of research being done all over the world. I am trying to keep up with the latest data, and I am passing that information on to anyone who wishes to receive occasional emails. Please do NOT rely on information from any president about any health matter. Here are my recommendations at this time: 1. Wash your hands. Wash your hands. Wash your hands. Plain soap & water actually kills virus ~ scrub for 30 seconds minimum Hand sanitizer with a minimum of 60% alcohol is a good alternative when soap and water are not available. Do not put sanitizer on pets. DO NOT use sanitizers that contain methanol (wood alcohol), a substance that can be toxic when absorbed through the skin. 2. Try not to touch your face. Especially not your mouth or nose 3. Get plenty of Sleep! Many people are worried during these difficult times, but if you take your worries to bed it can interfere with getting a good night's sleep. Poor sleep or lack of sleep weakens the immune system, making us more vulnerable to coronavirus. Failing to get enough rest can reduce infection-fighting antibodies. In fact, sleep-deprived people are more likely to get sick after being exposed to the common cold virus than people who get adequate sleep. Getting a good night's sleep of at least 7 hours, and ideally 8-10 hours actually strengthens the immune system. 4. Diet Eat a healthy diet with as many fresh organic vegetables and fruits as possible. 4-5 servings of vegetables to 1 serving of fruit. Avoid refined sugar and fructose, especially high fructose corn syrup. Refined sugar prevents your white blood cells from performing their important duties for hours. Fructose lowers your Vitamin D level. Avoid processed foods. Focus on fresh, local, organic produce. Foods that strengthen the immune system and help your body fight viruses include: greens mushrooms berries onions peas beans/legumes/lentils seeds nuts cruciferous vegetables citrus fruit garlic green tea apple celery tomato black tea red bell pepper carrots fermented food (yogurt, kefir, kombucha) kale lean protein (seafood, organic chicken) spinach Stay well hydrated with clean water and other liquids that do not contain sugar or HFCS. 5. If you smoke, please at least cut back on the smoking because it impairs your lungs' ability to fight off the virus, and endangers your loved ones at home. Smoking increases ACE2 receptors in the lungs where the coronavirus binds to get into your body. Smokers have a greater chance of getting sick from the virus, and have more severe cases when they catch it. If you would like support to quit smoking, contact me to learn about helpful measures to support you successfully quitting smoking. 6. If you have diabetes or pre-diabetes, blood sugar control is very important during the pandemic (and during tick season). If you have not checked your hemoglobin A1C level recently, it should be checked and doses of medicines if taken adjusted for optimal blood glucose control. Make an appointment with me for guidance on effective herbal treatments. 7. Vitamins, Supplements and Herbal Medicines that support the immune system to fight off infections, including coronavirus: Vitamin D Most of us are deficient in Vitamin D. I have advocated for many years taking Vitamin D3 to support the immune system for all kinds of infections, including Lyme disease and coronavirus. High Vitamin D levels are associated with lower rates of breast cancer, colon cancer, diabetes, and depression. Vitamin D activates innate immune cells and induces cathelicidin, an antiviral peptide secreted by immune cells and respiratory epithelial cells. Studies of coronavirus cases indicates that people with the lowest Vitamin D levels experience more severe COVID-19 infections, while people with higher Vitamin D levels have milder symptoms. Adults should be taking Vitamin D3 in a dark capsule with oil inside, not a tablet form. This is because Vitamin D is an oil-soluble vitamin. It is poorly absorbed if taken in a tablet form, or taken with water. Look for doses of 5,000 IU or 125 mcg in an oil base capsule. Take the Vitamin D3 at the same time that you are eating or drinking an oil- or fat- based food or drink. (cream in coffee, vegetables sauteed in olive oil or butter, salad dressing with oil in it, whole milk, cheese, avocado, meat, poultry, fish, etc) These foods that contain oil or fat trigger enzymes that break down oil and fat so your body absorbs those nutrients, including absorbing the Vitamin D into your body much more effectively. So take the Vitamin D3 capsule at the same time that you eat these types of foods (or drinks) that contain healthy oil or fat. I recommend that adults take one capsule of 5,OOO IU / 125 mcg dose a day if you are younger than 60 and spend little time in the sun. If you are older than 60, or if you have dark skin, you may need a higher dose. Ideally, the exact dose of Vitamin D3 best for you to take should be individually determined by checking your Vitamin D level - a blood test I can order for you. If you develop symptoms of COVID-19, increase the dose to 2 capsules (10,000 IU) a day for four days only. Then resume the dose you were taking before you started to feel ill. Vitamin C Ascorbic acid form of Vitamin C is fine. Buffered Vitamin C is preferred, but any form of Vitamin C you can obtain. I recommend that adults take 500 mg - 3,000 mg a day unless you have had kidney stones or other kidney disease. In that case, 250-500 mg a day would be fine. Push up the dose of Vitamin C until your stools get loose, then lower the dose until your bowel movements normalize. Your intestines will tell you what dose your body can handle. It is best to take Vitamin C split into 2-3 doses a day when taking more than 500 mg a day. Vitamin C has direct antiviral effects, and it boosts the immune system to fight off infection. Vitamin C is an antioxidant, and neutralizes free radicals. It reduces NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which is responsible for pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome in avian influenza H5N1 infection. If you develop symptoms of coronavirus infection, increase the Vitamin C dose to at least 5,000 mg (5 grams) a day, in divided doses, with lots of water. IV Vitamin C has been used successfully in some hospitals, but taking it by mouth may be just as effective. Astragalus I advise taking 500 mg capsule twice a day on days when you will be interacting with people in public indoor spaces (and for the duration of tick season, unless you are in treatment for Lyme disease). Do not take astragalus for more than two weeks. Astragalus is an herbal medicine that has been used all over the world for thousands of years. It strengthens the part of the immune system that I refer to as the \"first responders\". Specifically, astragalus supports Natural Killer cells that drive the key immunological response to viral infection. Astragalus has also been shown in animal studies to decrease the activity of ACE2 receptors, where the coronavirus attaches to our cells. If you develop possible coronavirus symptoms (fever, chills, sweats, headache, weakness, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, loss of taste or smell, stomach ache, diarrhea), double the doses above for 4 days, then reduce back to the doses listed above. Baby Aspirin Research indicates that people who take low-dose aspirin (81 mg, enteric coated) every day have significantly lower risk of complications or death from COVID-19 if they get sick enough to need hospitalization. If you are already taking a baby aspirin every day to prevent cardiovascular disease, don't make any changes. Before initiating a daily low dose of aspirin you should discuss this with your primary care provider to thoroughly assess the pros and cons of starting this based on your individual medical history and conditions. 8. Melatonin A study done at the Cleveland Clinic found that use of the supplement melatonin is associated with a reduction of 30% likelihood of testing positive for the coronavirus. The reduction for African-Americans is 52%. Melatonin is a hormone secreted by the pineal gland and by certain naturally occurring bacteria in the body. Melatonin regulates the body's circadian rhythm and sleep-wake cycle. Some people find it helps them sleep better. Melatonin has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and is also known to be an anti-viral agent that can be used to treat viral infections other than COVID-19. The study findings justify recommending low dose melatonin before bedtime, especially in the elderly and African Americans. Doses of 0.3 mg to 3 mg are safe and help some people sleep better. 9. Stress management These are very stressful times, but it is important to keep your stress level under control. Psychological stress disrupts your immune system and causes inflammation in the body. Prayer and various mindfulness techniques such as meditation, breathing exercises, yoga, and guided imagery can help you calm down, reduce that inflammation, and keep your immune system healthy and strong. Lemon balm, lavender, and other calming herbs can be used as teas or diffused as essential oils. If you feel like you are not able to keep your stress level under control, seek help from a counselor or therapist. COVID-19 affects different people in different ways. Infected people have had a wide range of symptoms reported - from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19: Fever* or chills Cough* Shortness of breath* or difficulty breathing Fatigue Muscle or body aches Headache New loss of taste or smell Sore throat Congestion or runny nose Nausea or vomiting Diarrhea * these are the 3 most common symptoms of COVID-19 infection Look for emergency warning signs for COVID-19. If someone is showing any of these signs, seek emergency medical care immediately: *Trouble breathing *Persistent pain or pressure in the chest *New confusion *Inability to wake or stay awake *Bluish lips or face If you get sick with COVID-19, it is best to avoid aspirin, tylenol or ibuprofen. Let the fever burn. There are treatments you may wish to consider, such as zinc, quercetin, NAC, chaga, Vitamin A, andrographis, olive leaf extract, melatonin, glutathione, resveratrol, flavonoids, chinese skullcap, or certain prescription medications. I can order a reliable COVID-19 Antibody test at a local lab. Be aware that antibodies do seem to stick around for at least 8 months, and much longer in most cases. Regardless of antibody status, if you have had a COVID-19 infection and recovered (as the vast majority of people do), you will have activated T Cells that may protect you from reinfection. "}
