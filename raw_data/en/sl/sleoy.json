After indicating how the Fathers understood the psyche and its relationship with body and spirit, the author gives a detailed analysis of the different causes they attribute to mental illness and the various treatments recommended. At the same time he shows how, relying on fundamental Christian values, they manifest a constant solicitude and respect for the sick, and how they are at pains to integrate them into community life and have them participate in their own healing, foreshadowing in this way the needs and aspirations of our own time. The last part discloses the deep significance of one of the strangest and most fascinating forms of asceticism the Christian East has known: 'Folly for the sake of Christ', a madness feigned with the goal of attaining a high degree of humility, but also a way well-suited, through a close experience of their condition, to help those who are often among, today as in the past, the most destitute. Praise for Mental Disorders and Spiritual Healing \"Mental Disorders and Spiritual Healing clearly reveals dimensions of patristic psychology that are not what most of us would have expected. It is a book that should be of interest to people in many fields, laymen as well as professionals. Its unique insights will be of benefit to anyone sincerely seeking a greater self-knowledge\u2014the sort of knowledge that is based on the true, but now largely forgotten, stature of humanity.\" \u2014 JENNIFER DOANE UPTON author of Dark Way to Paradise: Dante's Inferno in Light of the Spiritual Path About the Author Jean-Claude Larchet is docteur of Th\u00e9rapeutique des maladies spirituelles and The Theology of Illness, he is a specialist in questions of health, sickness, and healing.
