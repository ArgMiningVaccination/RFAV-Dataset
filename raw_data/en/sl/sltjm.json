Learn why we use roots, flowers, and leaves \u2014 and meet the herbs you love. Leaves Leaves are often prized for their mineral-rich, nutritive properties, along with their high content of aromatic oils (think mint & sage). Holy Basil leaves invigorate both the mind and the digestive system with their warming, volatile oils.* Flowers We formulate with flowers for their cooling, moistening properties that help to soothe irritated tissues and calm the mind. St. John's Wort flower is the perfect example of a mind-brightening herb.* Roots Roots are grounding, moving, clearing tools that support our natural detoxification pathways.
