Although outbreaks of EHM have been recognized for cen- turies in domestic horse populations, many aspects of this disease remained poorly characterized. In recent years, an improved understanding of EHM has emerged from experimental studies and from data collected during eld outbreaks at riding schools, race-tracks and veterinary hospitals throughout North America and Europe. These outbreaks have highlighted the contagious nature ofEHV-1 and have prompted a re-evaluation of diagnostic procedures, treatment modalities, preventative measures and biosecurity pro- tocols for the disease. This review concentrates on these and other selected, clinically relevant aspects of EHM. /C2112008 Elsevier Ltd.

Although equine a sporadic and relatively uncommon manifesta- tion of EHV-1 infection, it can cause devastating losses and have a severe impact on the equine industry, as exem-plied by recent outbreaks at riding schools, racetracks andveterinary hospitals throughout North America and Eur-ope ( Kohn et al., 2006; Henninger et al., 2007 ).The neurological signs of EHM reflect a diuse, multifo- cal myeloencephalopathy et al., 1986; Wilson, 1997 ). The sudden onset and early manifestation of ataxia, paresis and urinary incontinence, the involvement of multiple horses on thepremises, and a recent history of fever, abortion or respira-tory disease in aected horse populations are typical fea-tures, although there is considerable variation betweenoutbreaks with respect to epidemiological and clinical nd-ings ( Wilson, 1997 ). Prevention is dicult because many horses are latently infected, allowing the virus to circulatesilently in horse populations, and currently available vac-cines do not confer protection against neurological mani-festations of infection ( Patel and Heldens, 2005; Slater, 2007). Although outbreaks of EHM have been recognized for centuries among domestic horse populations, manyaspects of the disease remain poorly characterized. Selectedand clinically relevant aspects of EHM, such as diagnostic work-up, treatment, prevention and biosecurity, are reviewed in this article. 1090-0233/$ - see front matter /C2112008 Elsevier Ltd.

These include equine or Kohn and Fenner, 1987; Wilson and Pusterla, 2004 The sudden onset of neurological signs, including ataxia, paresis and urinary incontinence, the involvement of multi- ple horses and a recent history of fever, abortion, or respi-ratory disease in an aected horse population are sucientto make a tentative diagnosis of EHM ( Fig. 1). Pyrexia has consistently been reported as the major clinical sign before the onset of neurological disease but is frequently not pres- ent by the time neurologic decits become apparent ( Fri- day et al., Henningeret al., 2007 ). Denitive ante-mortem diagnosis of EHM is frequently not possible, since as test results lack consistency. How-ever, a diagnosis can be supported by ruling out other con-ditions, demonstrating xanthochromia and an elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein concentration, in identi- fying or isolating EHV-1 from the respiratory tract, buycoat or CSF and in demonstrating a 4-fold increase in anti-bodies using serum neutralizing (SN), complement xation(CF), or ELISA tests performed on acute and convalescentserum from aected or in-contact horses 7-21 days apart(Blythe et al., 1985; Friday et al., 2000; Van Maanen et al., 2001 ). Hematological abnormalities in horses with EHM are inconsistent and may include mild anemia and lymphope-nia in the early stages, followed a few days later by mildhyperbrinogenemia ( Paradis, 1996; Wilson, 1997 ). Azote- mia and hyperbilirubinemia may occur secondary to dehy-dration and anorexia, respectively. CSF analysis typically, although not always, reveals xanthochromia, an increased protein concentration (100-500 mg/dL), and an increased albumin quotient (ratio ofCSF to serum albumin concentration), which reflects vas-culitis with protein leakage into the CSF. The nucleatedcell count in the CSF is usually normal (0-5 cells/ lL) but is occasionally increased ( Jackson and Kendrick, 1971; Kohn and Fenner, 1987; Donaldson and Sweeney, 1998;Wilson and Pusterla, 2004 ). Abnormalities in the CSF are not present at the onset of clinical signs in some horsesand changes resolve quickly, so that the CSF may be nor-mal within 2 weeks of the onset of clinical signs. The presence of antibodies against EHV-1 in the CSF of clinically aected horses is strongly suggestive of EHM,although antibodies are absent in many cases ( Jackson et al., 1977; Kohn and Fenner, concentrations and EHV-1 antibody titer in both serum and CSF should be taken into account when interpreting CSF antibody Fig. 1. Algorithm to establish a rapid ante-mortem laboratory diagnosis of EHV-1 infection in a horse with neurological decits. Dashed arrows represent a presumptive, and solid arrows a diagnostic pathway.280 N. Pusterla et al. / The Veterinary Journal 180 (2009) 279-289results. Since the albumin quotient is usually elevated in aected horses and the IgG index is normal, the presenceof EHV-1 antibodies in the CSF reflects leakage of proteinacross a damaged blood-brain or blood-CSF barrier al., 1983; Keane et al., 1988 ). Antibodies are, therefore, more likely to be present in theCSF of aected horses with concomitantly high serumtiters. Blood contamination during collection of CSF, and other diseases that cause an increase in the permeabilityof the blood-brain barrier or bleeding into the subarach-noid space, may falsely elevate CSF antibody titers if serumtiters are also high. The detection by molecular methods or the isolation of EHV-1 from the CSF of aected horses will conrm a diagnosis but is rarely successful. Virus isolation is considered the 'gold standard' test for a laboratory diagnosis of EHV-1 infection and should beattempted, especially during epidemics of EHM, concur-rent with use of rapid diagnostic tests such as the polymer-ase chain reaction (PCR), in order to achieve retrospectivebiological and molecular characterization of the viral iso- late. Isolation and identication of EHV-1 from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs or buy coat samples is stronglysupportive of a diagnosis of EHM in a horse with compat-ible clinical signs. This requires submission of nasal ornasopharyngeal swabs in viral transport medium and anuncoagulated blood sample. Results of virus isolation may, however, be negative because the peak of virus shedding has usually passed by the time neurological signs appear, virus may be shed inter- mittently and local antibodies may interfere with virusrecovery ( Mumford, 1984 ). The likelihood of isolating EHV-1 during outbreaks of neurological disease isincreased by monitoring in-contact horses and collectingnasal or nasopharyngeal swab and buy coat samples fromthese animals during the prodromal febrile phase beforeneurological signs develop. However, it must also be con- sidered that the interpretation of positive viral cultures can be confused, given that EHV-1 has been isolated fromthe respiratory tract of healthy horses. Rapid laboratory tests for detection of EHV-1 are most useful in potential epidemics, because rapid identicationof the causative agent is often critical for guiding manage-ment strategies. PCR has become the diagnostic test ofchoice due to its high sensitivity and specicity and PCR detection of EHV-1 is routinely performed on secretions from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs or from uncoagulatedblood samples. Many conventional PCR detection proto-cols using single or nested methods and targeting specicEHV-1 genes have been published in recent years ( Ballag- i-Pordany et al., 1990; Sharma Borchers and 1993; Kirisawa et al., 1993;Lawrence et al., 1994 ). Although considerable progress has been made in developing PCR assays, the lack of lab-oratory protocol standardization and quality assuranceprocedures remain ongoing challenges.The increasing application of PCR in EHV-1 detection in practice settings has presented new dilemmas in testinterpretation, since such assays are unable to dierentiatebetween replicating (lytic), non-replicating or latent virus.Advances in technology and the use of novel PCR plat-forms, such as real-time PCR (RT-PCR), et al., 2006; Elia et al., 2006; Hussey et al., 2006 ). Viral load testing, although not routinely oered by many veterinarylaboratories, represents a major advancement in the diag-nosis of EHV-1 infection, as it allows better characteriza-tion of disease stage, better assessment of risk ofexposure of in-contact horses, and better monitoring of response to therapy. RT-PCR has recently been used to document dierences in EHV-1 viral loads in blood andnasal secretions between horses in the febrile and neurolog-ical stages of disease and between clinical and subclinicalcases ( Pusterla et al., 2008a ). These studies found high viral loads in the nasal secretions of animals with neurologicalsigns, conrming their importance as a potential sourceof contagion for other horses, and highlighting the need to impose strict biosecurity when horses are identied with suspected or conrmed EHM. However, random testing of clinically normal horses for EHV-1 by PCR should be avoided, since practicing veteri-narians and regulatory ocials, on receipt of positive testresults, may be unaware of the complexities involved in testinterpretation, leading to inappropriate decision-making inrelation to the quarantine of equine facilities or the cancel- lation of competitions. However, the situation is somewhat dierent when healthy horses, at high risk of exposure, aretested during an outbreak of clinical EHV-1 infection.Under such circumstances, horses that test positive byPCR on nasal or nasopharyngeal secretions should be iso-lated and closely monitored for the development of clinicalsigns, since the viral load aecting animals during the earlyincubation period is similar to that of subclinical carriers (Pusterla et al., 2008b ). Follow-up assessment of viral loads in blood and nasal or nasopharyngeal secretions can guide modications to control measures, including the lifting of quarantine forindividual horses that test negative on subsequent sam-pling. It should be noted that exposed but latently infectedhorses may test positive for EHV-1 but never exhibit clin-ical disease following exposure to an index case. Such latently infected horses may continue to test positive for extended periods of time, thus further confusing their clin-ical evaluation and confounding control procedures for in-contact horses. A recently identied variable region in the EHV-1 gen- ome correlates with neurological disease ( Nugent et al., 2006). This sequence variation occurs in the DNA poly- merase gene (ORF 30) involved in initial viral replication within cells. PCR assays based on ORF 30 have recently been developed and used to dierentiate between EHV-1isolates from neurologically and non-neurologicallyN. Pusterla et al. / The Veterinary Journal 180 (2009) 279-289 281aected horses ( Allen, 2007; Leutenegger et al., 2008 ). However, the genotyping of eld isolates needs to be inter- preted carefully, since between approximately 14% and24% of EHV-1 isolates from horses with EHM do not havethis neuropathogenic marker ( Nugent et al., 2006; Perkins et al., 2008 ). Strain characterization may be important however, given that the odds of neurological disease wheninfected with the neurotropic EHV-1 genotype versus thenon-neurotropic genotype are 162 times greater ( Perkins et al., 2008 ). Furthermore, detection of a neurotropic EHV-1 strain may influence therapy, especially the use ofanti-viral drugs, such as valacyclovir, used to decrease vire-mia and prevent the development of neurological sequelae. Serology that demonstrates a 4-fold or greater increase in serum antibody titer, using SN or CF tests, on acuteand convalescent samples collected 7-21 ( Friday et al., 2000; Van Maanenet al., 2001 ). Many horses with EHM, however, do not exhibit a 4-fold rise in SN titer, since titers rise rapidlyand may have peaked by the time neurological signs appear(Jackson and Kendrick, 1971; Jackson et al., 1977; Mum- ford, McCartan et al., 1995; Friday 2000;Van Maanen et al., 2001 ). Although serology is limited in conrming EHM in an individual horse, testing of pairedserum samples from in-contact animals is recommendedgiven that a signicant proportion of these animals sero-convert, providing indirect evidence of EHV-1 infection.Interpretation of serology is complicated by the fact thatthe SN, CF and ELISA tests in use at most diagnostic lab- oratories do not distinguish between antibodies to EHV-1 and -4. A specic ELISA based on the C-terminal portionof glycoprotein G of both viruses has been developed andshould prove valuable in the investigation and manage-ment of disease outbreaks in the future ( Crabb and Studd- ert, 1993; Crabb et al., 1995; Drummer et al., 1995 ). Histopathological examination of the brain and spinal cord is essential in conrming EHV-1 infection in a horse with suspected EHM. Vasculitis and thrombosis of small blood vessels in the spinal cord or brain are consistent his-topathological changes ( Whitwell et al., 1992 ) and virus detection in the CNS is achieved using immunohistochem-istry, in situ hybridization and PCR ( Schmidt et al., 1994; Leutenegger et 2008 ). Thus, molecular assays have supplanted more cumber- some and diagnostic modalities in the rou- tine diagnosis of EHV-1 infection. One of the main drawbacks of the PCR method has been the lack of stan-dardized protocols and the need for a consensus on theinterpretation of the results. It is suggested that diagnosticlaboratories should consider reporting quantitative infor-mation regarding PCR EHV-1 viral loads in blood andnasopharyngeal secretions, since this may influence the riskof exposure of other horses and may help practitioners and regulatory ocials make appropriate decisions regarding the management of horses that test positive. Furthermore,the detection of viral transcripts for 'late' genes may facil-itate the dierentiation of lytic and latent infection and theuse of PCR assays that determine viral genotype will helpin assessing the risk of an animal developing EHM follow-ing exposure. Although molecular detection techniqueshave become more complex in their interpretation, theinformation gleaned from such methods will help prevent disease spread and maximize treatment options for aected animals. Treatment The treatment of EHM is challenging and the outcome is directly related to the severity of the neurological decits in the aected horse. As no specic treatment is available,the management of aected animals is directed towards supportive nursing and nutritional care and in reducing CNS inflammation. Non-recumbent horses should be encouraged to stand and should be protected from self-inflicted trauma by theprovision of good footing (such as a grass paddock), byplacement of food and water in accessible locations at aconvenient height above ground level and by other mea-sures, including the use of padded hoods and the removal of obstacles. Patients that become recumbent should be maintained in a sternal position on a thick cushion of dryabsorbent bedding and should be rolled at least every 2-4 h to reduce the risk of developing myonecrosis and decu-bital ulcers. Whenever possible, animals should be lifted to,and supported in, the standing position using an appropri-ately tted sling. Slings are most benecial for moderatelyaected horses that are too weak to rise but are able to maintain a standing position with minimal assistance. Aected horses usually maintain a good appetite, even when recumbent, although hand feeding may be necessary to encourage some animals to eat. Maintenance of hydra-tion is important, and provision of a laxative diet or theadministration of laxatives, such as bran mashes, mineraloil, or psyllium, may be necessary to reduce intestinalimpaction. The nutritional and hydration needs of anorec- tic patients can usually be met by feeding gruels of alfalfa- based or similar pelleted feeds in water or balanced electro-lyte solutions via nasogastric tube. If oral intake is insu-cient to meet hydration requirements of 60-80 mL/kgbodyweight per day, hydration can be maintained by theintravenous (IV) administration of balanced electrolytesolutions. Partial or total parenteral nutrition can also beused to address the caloric needs of anorectic recumbent horses. If aected horses are unable to stand and urinate, or if bladder function is signicantly impaired, manual evacua- tion of the bladder by application of pressure per rectummay be necessary. If these measures are unsuccessful, judi-cious urinary catheterization is indicated and should beperformed aseptically with the collection tubing attachedto a sterile closed bag in order to minimize the risk of uri- nary tract infection. Urine scalding can become a major problem, particularly in mares 'dribbling' urine. Prevention282 N. Pusterla et al. / The Veterinary Journal 180 (2009) 279-289of such scalding involves the regular washing of the peri- neum, tail and hind legs with water, the application ofwater-repellent ointments and the braiding or wrappingof the tail to simplify cleaning. Administration of enemasor manual emptying of the rectum may also be necessaryto promote defecation and improve patient comfort. The medical treatment of horses with EHM focuses mainly on decreasing the inflammation associated withthe induced vasculitis. Recommended drugs routinely usedin the treatment of EHM are listed in Table 1 . Since the vasculitis, hemorrhage and edema, which are prominentearly lesions of EHM, may have an immunological basis,early treatment with corticosteroids is recommended. How-ever, no objective data are available to validate the ecacy of these or other anti-inflammatory drugs, and the use of corticosteroids remains controversial. A short course oftreatment with corticosteroids, such as prednisolone ace-tate or dexamethasone, for aected animals ( Kohn and The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory flunixin meglu- mine is indicated for treatment of CNS vasculitis and is typically used to treat EHM. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) administered IV as a 10-20% solution in normal saline orin 5% dextrose once daily for up to 3 days is commonlyused to treat horses with suspected CNS trauma or inflam-matory disease, such as EHM ( Henninger et al., 2007 ). Although the ecacy of DMSO in the treatment ofEHM has not been evaluated, its reported ability to inhibitplatelet aggregation and scavenge free-radicals supports its continued use. Because of the high risk of developing cystitis and other secondary bacterial infections, it is advisable to administer broad-spectrum antimicrobials, such as potentiated sulfon-amides or ceftiofur, particularly when accompanying corti-costeroid treatment. The choice of antimicrobials for thetreatment of secondary bacterial infection of the urinarytract, respiratory tract or other areas should be based onthe results of culture and susceptibility testing. Acyclovir, a synthetic purine nucleoside analog with inhibitory activity against several human herpesviruses,has recently been used in the treatment and prevention ofEHV-1 infection. The ecacy of acyclovir has been demon- Garre \u00b4et al., 2007a ). There describing the in vivo ecacyof acyclovir against EHV-1 infection and controlled clini-cal studies have yet to be carried out. The apparent benetof acyclovir therapy is supported by the successful treat- ment of congenital EHV-1 infection ( Murray et al., 1998; Friday et al., 2000 ) and by a reduction in the incidence of EHM in horses treated prophylactically with acyclovir during recent outbreaks ( Henninger et al., 2007 ). Pharma- cokinetic studies in adult horses with single oral adminis-trations of 10 and 20 mg/kg of acyclovir indicated poorbioavailability ( Bentz et al., 2006 ). This has raised questions about its use and, although IV admin-istration at 10 mg/kg theoretically produces therapeuticconcentrations, the high cost and lack of practicality maylimit its routine IV use ( Wilkins et al., 2005; Bentz et al., 2006). The primary route of elimination of acyclovir is renal, and some human patients with renal failure have developedadverse eects, primarily manifested as neurological distur- bances ( Adair et al., 1994 ). Therefore, renal function should be monitored and maintained when administering the drug. Recent preliminary data indicate that anothernucleoside analog, valacyclovir, may have promise in boththe treatment of EHV-1-aected horses and in the prophy-laxis and containment of EHV-1 ).

However, experimental studies areneeded to dene the appropriate doses of valacyclovirand acyclovir in horses and to document their ecacy inthe treatment of EHM. Aected horses that remain standing have a good prog- nosis, and improvement is generally apparent within a fewdays. Several weeks to more than a year may be requiredbefore horses with severe neurological decits completelyrecover. Some horses may be left with permanent residualneurological decits, including urinary incontinence andataxia. Prevention Following recent outbreaks of EHM in horse popula- tions in several regions of North America, many racing jurisdictions and managers of equine facilities and eventshave imposed EHV-1 vaccination requirements for incom-ing and resident horses in the hope that EHV-1 infectionand the development of EHM can be prevented. The merits of such an approach remain unproven and, in fact, fre- quent revaccination of mature horses to prevent EHM isnot clearly justied in most circumstances given thatEHM is a relatively rare disease from a population perspec-tive, most mature animals have previously been infectedwith EHV-1 and are latent carriers and none of the cur-rently available EHV-1 or EHV-4 vaccines claim to preventEHM. Currently available vaccines do not reliably block infec- tion, the development of viremia or the establishment oflatency and EHM has been observed in horses regularlyvaccinated against EHV-1 at 3-5 monthly 2000; Henningeret al., 2007 ). Furthermore, vaccination has been cited as a potential risk factor for the development of EHM, although the supporting evidence is far from conclusive. In contrast, eld experience in North America stronglysuggests that regular revaccination of pregnant mares andother horses on breeding farms reduces the risk of EHV-1 induced abortion and is thus justied ( Ostlund, 1993 ). Although there is no reliable method of preventing EHM, implementation of routine management practicesaimed at reducing the likelihood of introducing and dis- seminating infection Bryans, 1986 ). New arrivals should be isolated for at least 3 weeks before joining the herd, distinct herd groups should be maintained based on their age and use,and care should be taken to minimize or eliminate contactbetween resident and transient horses. In particular, preg-nant broodmares should be maintained in groups separatefrom the remaining population. In addition, it is prudent to minimize stress associated with overcrowding and handling procedures in an attempt to reduce recrudescence of latentEHV-1 infection.As with other herpesviruses, the ability of EHV-1 to infect horses and establish a long-term latent-carrier statein the face of the host immune responses assures indeniteendemic EHV-1 infection in the equine population. Resis-tance to resulting from recovery from eldinfection with EHV-1 is short-lived, lasting only a few weeks to a few months. After infecting the horse via the respiratory tract, EHV-1 rapidly becomes intracellular,including within circulating lymphocytes, and passesdirectly from cell to cell without an extracellular phase sothat the virus is not exposed to neutralizing antibodiesand other protective components of the immune response.In order to be eective, EHV-1 vaccines must satisfy a chal-lenging set of demands and activate a protective response that exceeds that provoked by natural infection. An ideal EHV-1 vaccine would not only be safe and lend itself to ecient delivery, it would also invoke strong, per- sistent (virus surface in order to block infection(Slater, 2007 ). In addition, such a vaccine would be required to induce durable systemic humoral and CTL responses to rapidly clear free virus and to destroy virus- infected cells in the event that the mucosal response didnot prevent systemic infection ( Slater, 2007 ). Beyond that, the ideal vaccine would need to induce this broad spectrumof responses in young foals to protect them against eldchallenge that inevitably occurs during their rst 2 yearsand leads to a chronic latent-carrier state ( Slater, 2007 ). Not surprisingly, currently available vaccines fall short of these ideals. Of the 17 vaccines containing an EHV-1 antigen mar- keted in North America or Europe, 15 are inactivated whole virus vaccines and two are MLV. All are adminis-tered by IM injection, 15 are licensed to aid the preventionof respiratory disease, and three (all inactivated) arelicensed to aid the prevention of abortion ( Patel and Hel- dens, 2005 ). The EHV-1 vaccines currently marketed in North America include two single-component inactivatedvaccines, namely Pneumabort K-1B (Fort Dodge) andProdigy (Intervet), that are licensed for the prevention ofabortion in pregnant mares, several multi-component inac-tivated vaccines (Prestige, Intervet; BoehringerIngelheim; Innovator, Fort Dodge) and one MLV vaccine(Rhinomune, Pzer) for the prevention of respiratory dis-ease induced by EHV-1 and -4. In Europe, Duvaxyn (Fort Dodge), an inactivated vaccine, is licensed to prevent both respiratory disease and abortion. Viral shedding after infection with EHV-1 is reduced in horses vaccinated with inactivated vaccines that Of the available inactivated vaccines, Calven- za, and both vaccines marketed for preventing abortion (Pneumabort K-1B and Prodigy) stimulate higher levels of VN antibody than do other multi-component vaccinesagainst respiratory disease ( Holmes et al., 2006 ). The284 N. Pusterla et al. / The Veterinary Journal 180 (2009) 279-289potency of vaccines protective against abortion is associ- ated with the stimulation of VN antibody and appearsrelated to their high antigenic mass relative to that of therespiratory disease vaccines. Furthermore, the carboxy-polymer adjuvant is likely to be an important contributorto the potency of Calvenza, a vaccine of lower antigenic mass than the abortion vaccines. Even though both abor- tion vaccines are inactivated, they have recently beenshown to induce interferon-gamma production, suggestingactivation of a T-cell immune response ( Holmes et al., 2006). Whereas there is good evidence that inactivated EHV-1 vaccines that stimulate high levels of VN antibody arecapable of reducing viral shedding and the incidence and severity of respiratory disease and abortion in both 'eld' and experimental settings, compelling evidence for theirecacy in preventing EHM is lacking. Of the few publishedstudies 2/6 (33.3%) of non-vaccinated control pregnantmares developed neurological disease and 3/6 (50%)aborted when challenged with the Army 183 strain ofEHV-1 in a study assessing the protective ecacy ofPneumabort K-1B against abortion ( Moore and Koonse, 1978). In contrast, none of the 11 mares vaccinated twice with Pneumabort K-1B 62 days apart developed neurolog-ical disease and 18% (2/11) aborted when challenged withthe Army 183 strain by nasal spray 15 days after the secondvaccination ( Moore and Koonse, 1978 ). Although a shorter mean duration of viral shedding was observed invaccinated than in control mares (0.72 relative to 3.5 days),statistical analysis of the signicance of apparent dier- ences between the two groups with regard to viral shedding and the development of neurological signs post-challengewas not carried out. Interestingly, the Army 183 strain ofEHV-1 has recently been shown to carry the D752 poly-merase gene mutation associated with an increased riskof inducing neurological disease ( Perkins et al., 2008 ). In contrast to the ndings with inactivated vaccines, attenuating eect of vaccination with Rhino- mune MLV on viral shedding post challenge does not appear to be dependent on induction of high levels ofVN, again providing circumstantial evidence for the impor-tance of cellular and local responses in reducing viral shed-ding ( Goodman et al., 2006 ). Five horses challenged with the neuropathogenic Findlay 03 strain of EHV-1 by aero-sol 2 weeks after completion of a two-dose immunizationseries with Rhinomune shed signicantly less virus for a substantially shorter period than did a group of ve unvac- cinated control horses and a group of ve horses vacci-nated with a low antigenic mass inactivated EHV-1/-4vaccine al., cinated horses shed virus transiently after challengewhereas all ve horses in each of the other groups shedvirus. In addition, none of the ve Rhinomune-vaccinatedhorses developed neurological signs after challenge, whereas 3/5 (60%) horses in each of the other two groups did. All horses used in this study were mature adults agedfrom 3 to 10 years old and were presumably not na \u00a8ve toEHV-1 infection, even though serum EHV-1 VN antibodytiters were <24 in all animals prior to vaccination. While the results of these challenge studies are promis- ing and constitute a valuable contribution to the literature,the low numbers of horses used, the failure of either vac-cine to prevent infection or signicantly reduce the level of viremia, the lack of statistical signicance of the results pertaining to the prevention of neurological signs, and thewell-known diculties encountered in accomplishing aconsistent and reproducible challenge model for neurologicEHM justify caution in their interpretation. However, thesignicant reduction in viral shedding observed in vacci-nated horses provides reasonable justication for boostervaccination of non-exposed horses at risk for infection in order to reduce viral shedding in the event of exposure to EHV-1. By enhancing herd immunity, it is hoped that thelevel of infectious virus circulating in the at-risk populationand, in turn, the risk of individual horses in the populationdeveloping disease, will be reduced ( Kohn and Fenner, 1987). This approach also relies on the assumption that the immune system of most mature horses has been primedby prior exposure to EHV-1 antigens through 'eld' infec- tion or vaccination and can therefore be boosted within 7- 10 days of administration of a single dose of vaccine.Although the validity of this approach has not been criti-cally evaluated for the prevention of EHM, its implementa-tion seems rational when faced with one or more horseswith conrmed clinical EHV-1 infection of any form. Whereas booster vaccination of horses that are likely to have been exposed is not recommended, it is rational to booster vaccinate non-exposed horses, as well as those that must enter the premises, if they have not already been vac-cinated against EHV-1 during the previous 90 days. Use ofRhinomune MLV or one of the inactivated EHV-1 vac-cines known stimulate high circulating titers of VN anti-body appears justied in this context. Horse owners mustdevelop an understanding of the concept of boosting herdimmunity to help protect individual horses rather than hav- ing an (as yet unattainable) expectation that the attending veterinarian can reliably protect an individual horse fromdeveloping potentially fatal EHM by administering oneof the currently available vaccines. At the present time, acombination of appropriate biosecurity and regular vacci-nation is likely to reduce the risk of acquiring infection. Intensive research to develop more ecacious EHV-1 vaccines has been ongoing at multiple centers around the world for many years. In addition to improved adjuvants and delivery routes, novel technologies currently underinvestigation include the use of vaccine vectors such ascanarypox, baculovirus, or vaccinia to deliver the EHV-1glycoproteins gB, gC, and gD or the immediate early gene,and the use of DNA vaccines that deliver genes encodingthese same glycoproteins, together with candidate CTL epi-topes al., 2006; 2006; Slater, 2007 ). In addition, prom- ising results have been obtained using an attenuated livevirus vaccine based on the temperature sensitive and host N. Pusterla et al. / The Veterinary Journal 180 (2009) 279-289 285range mutant clone 147 of EHV-1. This vaccine is novel in that a low dose administered intranasally replicated in thetarget species and conferred exceptional protection againstrespiratory disease, virus shedding, viremia and abortionfollowing a severe EHV-1 challenge ( Patel et al., 2003a,b, 2004). It is claimed that this intranasal MLV also protects against less common manifestations of EHV-1 as paresis and jaundice. Biosecurity There are signicant diculties in applying accepted prevention and control methods to EHV-1 infection in horses given that infection often occurs early in life andanimals tend to harbor the virus for years. Such features make the diagnostic testing of asymptomatic horses unpro- ductive. Secondly, the known tendency of the virus forrecrudescence during periods of stress makes the identica-tion of probable sources of infection extremely problem-atic. The following strategies are necessary to helpprevent the introduction of EHV-1 and to control thespread of this virus during neurological and non-neurolog-ical outbreaks. Strategies to prevent EHM in veterinary clinics To prevent EHM within veterinary clinics and hospitals, all horses presenting with signicant fevers and non-specic clinical signs that may or may not include neurologicalsigns should be strictly isolated until a diagnosis is secured.Such an approach can prevent the later quarantine of an entire hospital should EHV-1 infection be diagnosed subse- quently. The blood and nasal secretions of suspect horsesshould be tested repeatedly by RT-PCR for EHV-1, andother infectious agents, until these tests and accompanyingclinical signs conrm or rule out active EHV-1 infection.Once EHV-1 infection is conrmed, strict isolation proce-dures and secondary quarantine of both the clinic andthe source stable of the particular horse should be employed (see below). Strategies to prevent EHM on stables and farms All newly arrived horses should be isolated for at least 3 weeks. Foot-baths, boot covers and coveralls should be provided and adequately maintained for sanitary purposes.Separate equipment, tack, bedding and feedstus should be used in the care of these animals. Grooms and other per- sonnel should be instructed to work with these animals lastin the course of their daily routine. Exercise periods shouldbe conned to a time when other horses are not present inthe training areas and riders should wear protective cloth-ing and clean and thoroughly disinfect their boots, tackand hands after contact with such animals. Similarly visi-tors from other horse facilities should be instructed to park their cars at a distance from horse barns and stables and wear clean clothes and shoes or shoe covers and protectiveclothing provided by the stable. Horses returning fromshows or extended traveling events should be isolatedaccording to their particular circumstances. Minimum iso-lation precautions include the prevention of fomite trans-mission through 'nose nose' contact or the indirecttransmission of infective nasal secretions by mechanical transmission through stable employees or horse owners. All horse vans and trailers should be thoroughly cleanedand disinfected after use. Strategies to prevent EHM following equine athletic events Prevention of EHM following horse shows, races or other athletic events is problematic. While the requirement of an 'active vaccination status' prior to admittance andduring extended stays at such events may lessen the prob-ability of outbreaks of the respiratory form of EHV-1infection, no vaccine currently oers protection against the development of EHM. Consequently, the eectiveness of any such strategy in this context is questionable. Sincethe positive predictive value of PCR testing for EHV-1infection in asymptomatic horses is very low ( Pusterla et al., 2008b ), the requirement of a negative test prior to entry to an equine athletic event has very little merit. Like-wise, the testing of normal and unexposed horses stabledon the grounds of an event during an outbreak is not rec- ommended. The high percentage of horses known to have EHV-1 infection at any given time, combined with its pro-clivity to recrudescence, render the testing of asymptomatichorses a confusing and mostly futile exercise. Thus, the examination of newly arrived horses for clin- ical signs of disease, including twice daily assessment of rec-tal temperature, must for the time being remain the mosteective tool in determining possible sources of virus introduction. Strategies for control during outbreaks of EHM Following the identication of a horse with clinical signs consistent of EHM (such as fever, nasal discharge and the acute onset of neurological decits) measures must be insti-tuted immediately to conrm the diagnosis and control dis-ease spread. It is known that the nasal secretions of horseswith EHM contain large amounts of replicating virus andthese secretions in particular contribute to the spread ofdisease to other susceptible individuals. As a consequence, horses suspected of having EHM must be removed from the stable environment as quickly as possible and placedin strict isolation. Failure to remove these animals facili-tates the continued viral contamination of the environmentand contributes to the spread of disease. Attempts to prevent the spread of EHV-1 infection to additional horses without the removal and isolation of sickhorses is ineective (N. Pusterla, personal communication). Clinically aected horses should remain in strict quarantine until such time as they are proven either not to have EHV-1286 N. Pusterla et al. / The Veterinary Journal 180 (2009) 279-289infection or to have fully recovered and have been shown to be asymptomatic for 21 days. Horses known to have had intimate contact with a sus- pected EHM case should be maintained in their existingbarns and segregated from other horses during exerciseperiods until a diagnosis is made. Once conrmed, appro- priate quarantine restricting the movement of all poten- tially exposed horses is necessary to prevent the spread ofdisease to other locations. Aerosol transmission is considered less important than direct contact or spread of secretions on fomites betweenhorses by handlers (N. Pusterla, personal communication).These procedures may begin with the focal quarantine ofindividuals in the immediate area of exposure, such as a single barn or other unit of housing within a facility. Horses in the immediate focal contact area of the clinicallyaected (index) individual should be monitored twice dailyfor fever and, if found to be febrile, tested for EHV-1 infec-tion by PCR. Because of the known tendency for latencyand recrudescence with EHV-1 infection, contact horsesnot exhibiting fever or clinical signs should not be testedwith PCR methods, since the results obtained may not be related to disease transmission (see above). Since stress may play a role in eliciting the onset of clinical signs, horsesstabled in areas of known exposure should not be subjectedto strenuous physical exercise or long-distance transportuntil their health status is determined. If after focal quarantine measures, additional clinically ill or EHV-1 positive horse(s) are identied at other loca-tions within the facility, additional quarantine of exposed horses should be instituted and the area under quarantine may be expanded to include other aected barns or theentire stable area. An optimum strategy is the impositionof a series of focal quarantine procedures in an expandingseries of 'concentric rings' of disease control. Individual animals that have tested positive for EHV-1 infection within the designated quarantine area, whethersymptomatic or not, should be periodically retested until disease is conrmed or eliminated based on lack of clinical signs and a negative PCR test result. Quarantine should bemaintained until absence of further clinical cases and posi-tive tests from exposed horses suggest no new cases areoccurring. At this point areas of the facility under focalquarantine may have their restrictions rescinded in areverse concentric ring approach. Thus, early recognition of suspected cases and the close monitoring of high risk horses represent the most reliablemeasures of preventing outbreaks of EHM. Isolatinghorses with suspected EHM until a diagnosis is conrmedis recommended to prevent the exposure of susceptiblehorses. Conclusions Although EHM is a relatively uncommon manifestation of EHV-1 infection, it can cause devastating losses during outbreaks, as recently experienced at riding schools, race-tracks and veterinary hospitals throughout North Americaand Europe ( Kohn et al., 2006; Henninger et al., 2007 ). These outbreaks have highlighted the contagious natureof EHV-1 infection and the importance of rapid and reli-able detection methods. The traditional approach of virusisolation has been supplanted in recent years by more sen- sitive and rapid molecular-based detection techniques. Ante-mortem diagnosis of EHM relies mainly on the PCR detection of EHV-1 in nasal secretions and blood. Traditional qualitative PCR assays should not be used insupport of a diagnosis of EHM since such assays areunable to dierentiate between lytic and latent infection.Alternatively, novel quantitative PCR platforms, such asRT-PCR, should be used as these can determine the amount of virus present in blood and nasal secretions, a direct measure of the level of viremia and viral shedding,respectively. Further, molecular characterization of theviral state (lytic versus latent) is currently possible by thedetection of transcripts of 'late' genes. These novelapproaches, combined with new assays that can determinethe viral genotype (neurotropic versus non-neurotropic),may help equine practitioners determine the risk of expo- sure of other horses and to implement appropriate manage- ment practices to minimize disease spread. Management of horses aected by EHM must be aimed at supportive nursing, nutritional care and reducting CNSinflammation. Synthetic purine human herpesviruses, have recently been used in thetreatment and prevention of EHV-1 infection. Horses exhibiting sudden and severe neurological signs consistent with a diagnosis of EHM pose a denite risk to the sur-rounding horse population. Consequently, early interven-tion to prevent the spread of infection is required. Disease control measures, such as isolation of aected animals, segregation and monitoring of exposed horsesand quarantine measures, should be established in orderto prevent the spread of the virus. While there are several vaccines available against both the respiratory and aborti- genic forms of EHV-1 infection, currently no vaccines areprotective against the neurological strain of the virus.
