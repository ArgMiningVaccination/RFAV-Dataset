More than 261 million cases and 5.2 million Covid-19 deaths have been recorded so far. Coronavirus has the ability to mutate. The new variants such as omicron, beta, delta, gamma, lambda and mu seem to be more resistant to the existing vaccines like those of Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson and Sinovac. Covid-19 vaccines have been available for almost a year. Despite having one of the most successful vaccination programs in the world, USA remains as the worst affected country. More than 49 million cases including the 9.4 million active cases and around 800,000 deaths have been recorded in the US. Data showed that about 1 in 7 covid-19 deaths were in the US. Covid-19 Death Rate Known to be an airborne virus, coronavirus can stay in the air for a few hours. Coronaviruses tend to survive longer indoor. It can survive on non-porous surfaces (water resistant) like metal for up to 5 days and plastic for up to 9 days. Data from around the world showed that the Covid-19 death rate among infected people is around 2%. The ten worst affected countries as per 28th of November 2021 11:00 GMT: 1. USA with 799,312 covid-19 deaths 2. Brazil with 614,236 covid-19 deaths 3. India with 468,554 covid-19 deaths 4. Mexico with 293,859 covid-19 deaths 5. Russia with 272,755 covid-19 deaths 6. Peru with 201,071 covid-19 deaths 7. United Kingdom with 144,724 covid-19 deaths 8. Indonesia with 143,808 covid-19 deaths 9. Italy with 133,627 covid-19 deaths 10. Iran with 129,549 covid-19 deaths \" I developed Hair Loss Solution for Men and Women to help me dealing with my own androgenic alopecia.\" Henry Tianus [learn more >>>](https://henrytianus.com/products/hair-loss-solution-for-men-and-women) The Symptoms of Covid-19 Covid-19 is a highly infectious respiratory disease that can trigger inflammation in the lungs. Covid-19 may cause severe breathing difficulties that starve the body of oxygen. The symptoms of Covid-19 may include: - cough usually a dry persistent cough. Be well informed that Covid-19 patients may have runny nose and phlegm coughed up from the lungs. - breathing difficulties such as rapid sallow breathing, worsening chest pain with every deep breath and cough. - fever, shiver and sweating. - rapid heartbeat. - loss of appetite and energy. - joint and muscle pain. - headaches or even vomiting. - confusion and disorientation (drowsiness). Like with the other types of pneumonia, Covid-19 is a potentially life-threatening illness. For comparison, in 2017, there were more than 90,000 people died from pneumonia or influenza in the UK (The UK's Office for National Statistics). In the USA, every year there are around 50,000 people die from pneumonia. Pneumonia is the world's leading cause of death among children under 5 years old. Younger children and elderly people are generally more vulnerable to the deadly effects of pneumonia. Surprisingly, in the US, around half of the mortality due to pneumonia occur in people age between 18 and 64. The effective treatment for Covid-19 has yet to be found. Vaccines may help reduce Covid-19 mortality rate, however, they don't seem to be highly effective at preventing infection. \" It took 15 years to perfect the current formula of hair growth serum which I have developed to deal with my own androgenic alopecia.\" Henry Tianus [learn more >>>](https://henrytianus.com/products/hair-growth-serum) How to increase our survival rate from Covid-19? 1. Stay calm and rest In most cases, infected people start to experience Covid-19 symptoms within seven days, nevertheless, it may take up to 27 days for the symptoms to show up. By nature, our body is designed to fight off the infection, hence we need to rest if we are tested positive for Covid-19. 2. Self Isolate Infected people may get mild symptoms or even no symptom at all, however, they need to self isolate to prevent spreading the infection to others. Wear a face mask whenever you need to be around other people. In fact, it is better to keep wearing a face mask especially in indoor places for everyone (infected or not) during this ongoing pandemic. It is possible to catch more than one Covid-19 variants at the same time. We need to limit the exposure to different types of coronavirus when we are infected with one. This helps reduce the severity of the symptoms and increase our survival rate. 3. Seek medical help If the symptoms are getting worst, seek medical help immediately. The risk of dying from Covid-19 is significantly higher among elderly people and people with certain medical conditions such as asthma, high blood pressure, cancer, diabetes, lung and heart disease. 4. Eat Healthy There is no vaccine or drug or food that can fully prevent the coronavirus infection. However, we can strengthen our immune system to fight off covid-19. Cut down on junk foods and eat plenty of fresh vegetables, fruits, herbs and spices every day. A healthy diet helps reduce Covid-19 mortality rate. Data from six countries suggests that plant-based diets help reduce the severity of Covid-19 symptoms (BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health, June 07, 2021). Studies showed that garlic and ginger have antiviral properties. Both may help increase our survival rate from Covid-19. Fresh ginger helps fight off the viral infection caused by human respiratory syncytial virus. Ginger may also help reduce the breathing difficulties. Garlic and ginger have excellent anti-inflammatory properties to help calm down inflammation. I have been eating 2-4 cloves of raw garlic, 2-3 table spoons of raw ginger and 1 table spoon of turmeric powder every day since the pandemic started in early 2020. Turmeric contains curcumin, anti-inflammatory compound which has been shown to help reduce the severity of pneumonia caused by Influenza A virus (H1N1). I usually cut the garlic and ginger into tiny pieces then mix them with my foods. You can divide the portion into 3 for breakfast, lunch and dinner. For their therapeutic benefits, garlic and ginger should be eaten raw. You should not cook or heat them. Allicin, the main therapeutic substance in garlic is very sensitive to heat. If you are on medication for whatever reason, you should ask your GP first before you eat raw garlic, ginger or turmeric everyday. Garlic has detoxifying effects, hence it may reduce the efficacy of your medication. \" It took more than 10 years to perfect the current formula of Scalp Stimulator which I have developed to restore my hair density.\" Henry Tianus [learn more >>>](https://henrytianus.com/products/scalp-stimulator-hair-root-activator-for-thinning-hair) 5. Aromatherapy Essential Oils To Help Reduce Covid-19 Symptoms Studies showed that eucalyptus essential oil contains cineole that helps reduce inflammation and infection in the lungs. Eucalyptus Radiata essential oil has antiviral effects against coronavirus SARS. Rosemary essential oil has been shown to be effective against Klebsiella pneumoniae, a bacteria which causes pneumonia in humans and animals. Thyme essential oil has been shown to have antiviral activities against Influenza A virus (H1N1), while menthol with its cooling-effect has also been shown to reduce breathing difficulties. These essential oils may help you dealing with Covid-19 symptoms. If you don't have essential oils, use the steam from hot water to improve your breathing. Pour hot water into a cup or bowl and then breathe in the steam. Again, when the symptoms are getting worst, get medical help immediately. Covid-19 has been around for almost 2 years and we still don't know yet when this pandemic is going to go away. I hope this article helps people to learn how to live with coronavirus being around.
