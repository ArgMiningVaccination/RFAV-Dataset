Our specialists can provide you with the latest headache and migraine treatments. They will make sure your headaches are not being caused by a serious underlying health issue and, as needed, use state-of-the-art treatment technology to address both primary and secondary causes. Headaches are separated into two main categories: primary and secondary. At Advocate Health Care, our neurologists have the experience and expertise to identify and treat both primary and secondary headaches. A primary headache is generally triggered by nerves, blood vessels or muscles in your head and neck. Primary headaches can also be caused by diet and lifestyle including alcohol consumption, sleep deprivation, skipped meals and stress. Primary headaches include: A secondary headache is a symptom of another medical issue, ranging from a sinus infection to a stroke. Secondary headaches can be caused by serious conditions, such as: While most headaches are benign, sometimes a headache can be the only sign you'll get of a serious condition. Go to the emergency room or call 911 if you notice any of these things about your headache: Other symptoms to take seriously are changes in vision, slurred speech, confusion, balance problems, memory loss, stiff neck, fever, nausea, vomiting, pain with chewing or a headache that starts suddenly. Within the category of primary headaches, there are many different types. Each different type of headache has different symptoms and needs to be treated differently. The pain associated with migraine headaches is often described as throbbing or pounding. Migraine attacks cause moderate to severe pain that: Migraines also tend to run in families. We don't know what causes migraine headaches. You may notice that certain foods or ingredients tend to bring on migraines such as: Migraines often include a symptom called an aura. Migraines with aura are more common than migraines without an aura. A migraine aura happens before your headache starts and includes some sensory changes. Your hearing, speaking or vision may be affected, and you may notice weakness or tingling in your muscles at the same time. Cluster headaches are extremely painful - painful enough to wake you up if one starts while you're sleeping. The pain is described as an intense piercing or burning that: Men are more likely than women to have cluster headaches. Sometimes, cluster headaches go into remission (go away) for a long time. But they may come back later. Tension headaches come and go over time. They're the most common type of headache among teenagers and adults. Tension headaches cause mild to moderate pain that usually begins gradually and may last only minutes or go on for days. Women are slightly more likely to have tension headaches than men. We don't really know what causes headaches. Blood vessels and muscles in the head appear to send pain signals to your brain. The cause of those signals isn't clear. While we don't know what causes headaches, several things seem to be related to the start of a headache. Here are some common signs of an oncoming headache or migraine attack: Keeping a record of your headaches may help you identify triggers that affect you. Having a record can also help your doctor diagnose your headache and choose effective treatments. Keep track of the time of day, severity of pain on a scale from 1 to 10, description of the pain (e.g., pounding, burning, pressure), any triggers you noticed, and any medicine or other things that helped ease the pain. Your doctor will perform a complete physical examination and gather your health history - including your observations about your headaches. They may run some of the following tests to help diagnose your headache: Your doctor will recommend treatment based on your diagnosis. They may prescribe medication or recommend lifestyle changes for your headache care. Make sure to tell your doctor about any other medical conditions you have. Conditions like depression, insomnia and anxiety can contribute to headaches, so it's important for those conditions to be treated effectively. Medications for headaches fall into three general categories: preventive, acute and rescue. It's important to keep all kinds of prescribed medication refilled. Acute and rescue medications need to be available as soon as you need them. Preventive medications need to be taken regularly in order to work. Making sure you have medications available lets you treat headaches early and aggressively. To help treat your headaches, you can try resting with your eyes closed and a cool cloth over your eyes or an ice pack on your forehead. Taking a nap can also help. Make sure you drink enough water, particularly if you've been vomiting. To prevent migraines or other types of headaches, we may recommend these lifestyle changes. We help you live well. And we're here for you in person and online. "}
