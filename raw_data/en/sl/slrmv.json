It is typical to have good and bad days as well as ups and downs, but as a common rule, it is crucial to retain a middle ground or inner calm to which we return. However, people with bipolar symptoms experience extreme mood swings. They have a propensity to lose their internal balance, discovering themselves at extreme and opposite ends of the emotional scale. They can even find themselves switching between periods of mania or exuberant elation, when everything seems possible, and periods of bottomless miserable depression which can leave them in bed for several days or weeks unable to perform in their daily lives. We know how to balance these upheavals with safe, natural drug-free approaches. You can stop suffering from bipolar symptoms and medication side effects. To find out more about bipolar symptoms and how our residential mental health center provides a way for people to overcome bipolar disorder without long-term use of medication, call an Admissions Counselor. You can read more about our program below. 15 Years Experience by Professionals Who Understand Your Journey. Many with Bipolar Syndrome Are Unaware of the Seriousness One of the difficulties with bipolar disorder is that those struggling with the disorder are usually unaware of the seriousness and disturbance caused by their sporadic mood states.1 In the throes of a manic mood, the person is often convinced that absolutely nothing is abnormal about their behavior, and sometimes that may even declare that they've never felt better. Because of this, it is common that friends, family, or medical professionals who observe a problem might recommend professional treatment. When left untreated, the effects of bipolar symptoms can be incredibly disturbing and even dangerous.2,3 Don't delay your desire to receive natural medicine for bipolar. We use scientifically proven, drug-free approaches to stabilize brain function. Individuals in manic states have had a propensity to take large irrational risks which could have severe consequences such as car accidents, bankruptcy, getting fired, or unintentionally hurting others or themselves. Depressive moods are just as dangerous. Suicide rates are reported to be very high with this disorder.4 If you see these symptoms in others or yourself, you are encouraged to call our professional staff now. Help for Bipolar Disorder While prescription medication is the most traditionally given treatment for bipolar disorder, all of the medications prescribed for this disorder have various side effects. Some of these side effects can be quite severe. In some cases, the use of medication does not help bipolar symptoms or even makes them worse. Alternative to Meds Center uses cutting edge techniques, such as orthomolecular bipolar disorder treatment, to help people come off of prescription medications safely and comfortably. If you are currently on medication, we are equipped to provide medically supervised medication withdrawal relief and natural treatment for bipolar disorder. Do you wish to see yourself, or a loved one, living life in ways you know are achievable? We aim to teach our clients how to be their own mental health self-care experts. Holistic Treatment for Bipolar A highly practical holistic treatment while overcoming bipolar symptoms is CBT. Your therapist can help you discover the things that trigger unwanted mood swings and working together, strategies can be developed to find relief. For example, altering certain behaviors during a manic or depressive state can help. CBT addresses negative thought patterns and views of one's self and the world. As the name cognitive behavioral therapy suggests, there are two primary parts to CBT: Cognitive therapy helps change negative thoughts that contribute to emotional distress, and behavioral counseling helps change the way one acts to circumvent mood triggering situations. Strategies in Natural Medicine for Bipolar include: A clean, organic diet with adequate protein. Increased exposure to sunlight and fresh air.* Lab testing for toxic accumulations and removal of them, i.e., mercury, cadmium, lead, etc. Correcting hypoglycemia through diet and supplements. Avoid sugars, alcohol, caffeine, energy drinks, artificial sweeteners, food additives. Avoid exposure to neurotoxins found in cleaning supplies, body products, carpeting, etc.** *Studies6 have found a distinct relationship between suicidality and certain weather and temperature changes, such as winter months where exposure to sunlight is limited. Persons with bipolar disorders are even more likely to experience suicidal thoughts than others during these months, according to the extensive study presented by Dr. Marco Di Mercola in March of 2020. **Chemicals in household products can be neurotoxic, acting as endocrine disruptors, and can cause neurologic adverse effects7 according to a published review by Wong and Durrani in 2017. Natural Medicine for Bipolar Natural remedies for bipolar symptoms feature lab testing to identify any potential vitamin or mineral deficiencies. To address these deficiencies, natural substances are targeted to stabilize the neurochemistry. Additionally, IV nutrient treatments, supplements, and calming herbs are provided. Each person is given an entirely customized treatment plan, depending on the exact needs of their distinct biochemical makeup. This is the value of the lab testing we do, to discover the best path forward. At Alternative to Meds Center, we believe that food is a part of medicine. We use orthomolecular medicine for bipolar disorder to help correct underlying problems and create mental and physical stability. Effective remedies include dietary changes, nutritional therapies, correcting vitamin and mineral levels. Lifestyle changes can be important. One can try to get more exposure to sunlight as a simple lifestyle change that could be beneficial. Available sunlight changes with the seasons. Studies have shown that suicide attempts rise significantly in areas where there are big seasonal and temperature changes, i.e., during winter months where you find decreasing hours of sunlight.5 However, a primary therapy is the removal of chemicals and built up environmental toxicity through a blend of low-temperature sauna, ionic footbaths, nebulized glutathione, castor oil packs, and more depending on the specific client's needs. We focus on finding the underlying causes of bipolar symptoms. Our professional team creates a custom plan for each client's success. Factors Contributing to Bipolar Symptoms Genetic, environmental, and neurochemical factors likely contribute to the emergence and progression of bipolar symptoms. Stress is commonly blamed as a cause of mood swings, anxiety, and depression, but the source of stress and other similar problems is usually physical in nature. Hypoglycemia is one of the primary physical causes of stress. Hypoglycemia includes a range of emotional and mental symptoms such as anxiety, nervousness, restlessness, depression, irritability, violent outbursts, inability to concentrate, and mood swings. Hypoglycemia solutions include nutrient and dietary recommendations and intake of supplements and vitamins. Hypoglycemia may be implicated in a number of bipolar disorder cases. Foods for Overcoming Bipolar Disorder Many individuals struggling with this disorder find it beneficial to eliminate specific foods from their dietary regimen. Excluding alcohol and drugs is essential for people with bipolar, as alcohol and other drugs are depressants that can cause mood swings. Sugar is another food that can trigger mood swings. Simple sugars such as those in desserts are known to worsen mood swings. It's imperative to stay away from caffeinated food and drinks like chocolate, coffee, and soda. These can boost energy and mood temporarily, however they may result in exhaustion ( crash ) later. A natural mental health addiction treatment program that provides a healthy foods diet is necessary for the brain and body to receive the proper amount of nutrients and vitamins daily. Eating a whole meal with vegetables, fruits, fish, and poultry products, can assist someone with this disorder in overcoming mood swings. A healthy brain is one that is well-fed and clear of chemicals.
