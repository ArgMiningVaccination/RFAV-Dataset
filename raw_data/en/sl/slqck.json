No student may commence placement at ACT Health prior to a National Police Check and issuing and assessment of a National Police Certificate. ACT Health will accept a National Police Certificate from the Australian Federal Police, the National Police Checking Service, State Police, and accredited organisations, provided it is dated no more than twelve (12) months prior to the first clinical placement with ACT Health. Please see the links below to the AFP police check and the ACIC list of accredited organisations. AFP - [https://www.afp.gov.au/what-we-do/services/criminal-records/national-police-checks](https://www.afp.gov.au/what-we-do/services/criminal-records/national-police-checks) ACIC - [https://www.acic.gov.au/](https://www.acic.gov.au/) A NPC for health/hospital workers in the ACT provides a complete disclosure certificate, which means all recorded offences are released. Students are to provide a copy of their National Police Certificate to their Education Provider placement coordinator well in advance of a scheduled ACT Health clinical placement date. Students with positive police checks are required to complete an 'Authorisation to Investigate' form and provide their National Police Certificate with a statement to their education provider. The Education Provider will forward it directly to either the CPO Manager or, for Allied Health students only, to the CPO Allied Health Placement Officer. Clearance for placement will be sought from ACT Health's People and Culture Branch. Clearance must be obtained prior to the student being allocated for placement. ACT Health will determine whether a student or trainee with a criminal record is accepted for any clinical placement in accordance with the CPO NPC review process. Where the placement concerns a student or trainee who is not affiliated with an Education Provider, the student or trainee should submit the required information directly to the CPO. For International Students and Trainees International students may be required to undertake a local police check, as well as an Australian National Police Check prior to placement with ACT Health.
