Stanford researchers helped to develop the first FDA-approved cancer cell therapies, and Stanford remains at the leading edge of CAR T-cell therapy research to expand the use of cell therapy across more types of cancer. 900 Blake Wilbur Drive Palo Alto, CA 94304 Phone: [650-723-0822](tel:650-723-0822) [Getting Here \u00bb](https://stanfordhealthcare.org/medical-clinics/cell-therapy-program.mapmodal.html) What We Offer You for Cell Therapy Care - Pioneering expertise in treating recurrent non-hodgkin lymphoma and recurrent or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia [Go to Conditions Treated](#conditionstreated) - Advanced treatment options in cancer cell therapy [Go to Treatments](#treatments) - Team-based approach to treatment planning and delivery to tailor care to your needs [Go to Your Care Team](#careteam) [Clinical trials to harness cell therapy in the fight against additional cancers and noncancerous conditions](#careteam) [Go to Clinical Trials](#clinicaltrials) - Comprehensive support services to help you and your family focus on health and healing [Go to Support Services](#supportservices) Understanding CAR T-Cell Therapy CAR T-Cell therapy is a type of immunotherapy, which increases the capacity of immune cells to fight disease. A type of white blood cell called a T-Cell is collected and genetically modified to develop a chimeric antigen receptor or CAR. Those receptors latch onto a specific antigen on the surface of the cancer cell to disrupt and destroy it. Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a cancer. Like other cancers, it starts when cells grow out of control, multiplying and crowding other normal cells. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma starts in the lymph system, which contains the lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow. The lymph system is part of the body's immune system that protects it from infections and diseases. Lymph nodes contain the lymph fluid that carries white blood cells through a network of thin tubes spreading through the body. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Leukemia is a cancer of the blood. In leukemia, normal blood cells are transformed in ways that lead to high counts of white blood cells called lymphocytes. Cancer Cell Therapy Guidebook The Stanford Cancer Cell Therapy care team developed a guidebook to help you understand what to expect before, during, and after cancer cell therapy. [Click here to learn more: Cancer Cell Therapy Guidebook (PDF) \u00bb](/content/dam/SHC/clinics/cell-therapy-program/docs/Cell%20Therapy%20Guidebook.pdf) Lymphocytes are made by the bone marrow and by organs of the lymph system. The term \"acute\" means that the disease progresses rapidly. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a fast-growing, aggressive cancer. Sometimes ALL also spreads beyond the blood and affects internal organs or other areas of the body. Treatments Chimeric Antigen Receptor Therapy, or [CAR T-Cell Therapy,](https://stanfordhealthcare.org/medical-treatments/c/car-t-cell-therapy.html) is a type of immunotherapy that increases the capacity of immune cells to fight disease. A type of white blood cell called a T-Cell is collected and genetically modified to develop a chimeric antigen receptor. Those receptors attach to cancer cells and kill them. CAR T-Cell Therapy is approved by the FDA and offered at Stanford for patients with specific types of [non-hodgkin lymphoma](https://stanfordhealthcare.org/medical-conditions/cancer/non-hodgkin-lymphoma.html) and [acute lymphoblastic leukemia](https://stanfordhealthcare.org/medical-conditions/cancer/acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-all.html) in patients up to the age of 25. It is available through clinical trials for these diseases and other forms of cancer. Clinical Trials We offer one of the nation's most robust Cancer Cell Therapy clinical trial programs. New CAR T-cell treatments are being developed and evaluated at Stanford. As a Stanford Health Care patient, you may be eligible to participate in open clinical trials. Contact your doctor for more information. Your Cell Therapy Care Team Each person's cancer experience is unique, which is why we personalize your treatment plan and care team needs.

FAQs for Cell Therapy CAR T-Cell therapy is a type of immunotherapy, which increases the capacity of immune cells to fight disease. A type of white blood cell called a T-Cell is collected and genetically modified to develop a chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR. Those CARs latch onto a specific antigen on the surface of the cancer cell to disrupt and destroy it. CAR T-Cell therapy is approved by the FDA to treat some forms of non-hodgkin lymphoma and for patients with recurrent or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia up to age 25. There are several ongoing trials of CAR T-cell therapy for other forms of blood cancers and some solid tumors. We work with patients and insurers to secure health insurance coverage for eligible patients. More insurers are covering care for FDA-approved therapies. Side effects are generally easier to tolerate than those associated with chemotherapy. Our care team will monitor your response to the treatment and manage any reactions or complications. Side effects can be mild or more severe but are treatable and generally indicate the therapy has activated the immune system to fight the cancer. The most common side effect of CAR T-Cell therapy is called cytokine release syndrome or CRS. It can affect up to 9 in 10 CAR T-Cell patients. It is generally brief, lasting about a week. Many patients liken it to the flu with fever, low energy, and body aches. It is treatable with medication. The other side effect is known CAR T-Cell-related encephalopathy syndrome or CRES. Its symptoms are more severe than those of CRS and may include memory loss or confusion. In rarer cases, they may affect speech. CRES is treatable. Symptoms usually go away after a few days. Stanford has the knowledge and resources to manage these reactions when then they occur. The treatment process involves: - Evaluation to confirm that CAR T-Cell Therapy is a recommended treatment - Collection and sorting of blood cells to isolate T-cells for therapy - Genetic modification of T-cells in a lab to cause them to develop chimeric antigen receptors that target cancer - Culturing these modified cells in a lab to increase the number of available CAR T-cells - Preparative regimen of chemotherapy to get your body ready to receive the CAR T-cells - Infusion of the CAR T-cells into the body - Recovery of a few months, while your immune system stabilizes and gets stronger For Referring Physicians PHYSICIAN HELPLINE Fax: 650-320-9443 Monday-Friday, 8 a.m.-5 p.m. Stanford Health Care provides comprehensive services to refer and track patients, as well as the latest information and news for physicians and office staff.
