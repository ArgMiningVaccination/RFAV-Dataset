It's the only place you have to live. - Jim Rohn In Just the Fats Ma'am, you learned what a healthy fat looks like, how to cook safely with different fats, and why fats are good for you. In This Is Your Brain On Fats, you learned how Omega-3 fatty acids are highly concentrated in the brain and play a critical role in brain function. In this final installment, you'll learn how healthy fats are essential to your physical health and how they help improve your well-being. Low-fat options have exploded in the grocery aisles but so has American obesity. Why? As described in the previous blog entries about fat, the human body needs fat to survive and flourish. The answer is not cutting out fat. Instead, eating the right types of fat in the right ratio and reducing processed carbohydrates and sugars are the keys to weight management and optimizing health. The Right Types of Fats Natural fats from whole food sources - whether saturated, monounsaturated or polyunsaturated - are all healthy. Fake fats, such as trans fats, and rancid fats from highly processed vegetable oils or cooking fats past their smoke point are not healthy. This was established in Just the Fats Ma'am. Furthermore, Omega-3 fatty acids enhance health in a myriad of ways, both preventative and protective. The most substantial is in the prevention of heart disease. Clinical evidence shows that omega-3 fatty acids help lower the risk of heart attack, stroke, and abnormal heart rhythms. Omega-3s also appear to slow the development of arterial plaque and blood clots and may play a protective role in cancer: Colon cancer - Omega-3s may reduce the risk of colorectal cancer and help slow the progression of colon cancer at early stages. Breast cancer - Women who eat foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids over many years may be less likely to develop breast cancer. Prostate cancer - Omega-3s may help prevent the development of prostate cancer. That's not all omega-3s can do to improve body health. Various studies show that omega-3s may also be beneficial in the following ways: Reduce cholesterol - Omega-3s can lower total cholesterol and triglycerides in people with high cholesterol levels. Lower blood pressure - Omega-3s can lower blood pressure in people with hypertension. Decrease Risk of Diabetes - Omega-3s can lower triglycerides and apoproteins (markers of diabetes). Reduce symptoms of Rheumatoid arthritis - Omega-3s can reduce symptoms, including joint pain and morning stiffness. Improve Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) - Omega-3s can reduce symptoms of lupus, an autoimmune condition characterized by fatigue and joint pain. Decrease Risk of Osteoporosis - Omega-3s can increase levels of calcium in the body and improve bone strength. Improve Skin disorders and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) - Omega-3s can help with psoriasis and IBD when taken with prescription medication. Relieve Asthma - Omega-3s can help relieve asthma symptoms. Prevent Macular Degeneration - Omega-3s can help in preventing macular degeneration. Reduce Menstrual Cramps - Omega-3s can help reduce menstrual pain. The Right Ratios of Fats As mentioned in Just The Fats Ma'am, consuming roughly each of the three major types of fats - saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated - over the course of your week can create variety while improving overall health. Let's dive deeper into a subcategory of fats, the Omegas. There are two major types of polyunsaturated fats - Omega-3 and Omega-6. You learned in This Is Your Brain On Fats that omega-3's are found in marine life and some plants. Omega-6 fats are found in seeds like sesame and sunflower as well as vegetable oils like corn, evening primrose, safflower, and soybean oils. Omega-3s are anti-inflammatory while omega-6s are pro-inflammatory. Although inflammation sounds bad, both fats are beneficial. Inflammation is important for survival, protecting against infection and healing injuries. The issue is inflammation in excess. Excess inflammation may be one of the leading drivers of heart disease, many types of cancer, and other serious diseases. The body needs to find balance of protective and healing inflammation without going overboard. That balance can come from a better ratio of omega-3 and omega-6 intake. A diet high in omega-6 but low in omega-3 increases inflammation. Unfortunately, most Americans eat way more omega-6 fats than omega-3 fats - the average ratio is 16:1! This heightens the problem, creating a nationwide epidemic of detrimental inflammation. Compare that with a 1:4 ratio of the Inuits, who don't suffer from many of the chronic diseases that plague people in the United States. You don't have to live off whale, seal and walrus to optimize health! Instead, work toward a better ratio of omega-6 to omega-3. A healthy ratio can range from 4:1 to 1:4. How do you maintain a healthy ratio between omega-3s and omega-6s? Eat low-mercury fish at least twice per week, snack on nuts and seeds, eat plenty of green vegetables and, most importantly, reduce consumption of highly processed vegetable oils, refined carbohydrates and sugars. Reduce Refined Carbohydrates and Sugary Foods According to a large analysis published in 2009, replacing saturated fats in the diet with carbohydrates did not reduce risk of heart disease. In fact, refined carbohydrates and sugary foods have been found to increase triglyceride levels and high triglycerides may be associated with heart disease and diabetes. Refined carbohydrates and sugary foods provide no natural fiber and little to none of their original nutrients. Instead, reach for whole food carbohydrates - whole grains, pseudograins like quinoa, fresh fruits and vegetables and beans and legumes. These are in their most natural state, are absorbed slowly which stabilizes blood sugar, and supply plenty of energy, fiber, vitamins, and minerals. With simple swaps, and a new found love of healthy fats, you will be on your way to a happier, healthier you! "}
