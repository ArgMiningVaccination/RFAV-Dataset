Detox Herbal Tea helps to flush out the systems that collect toxins, as well as both healing and supporting those systems. By starting with the blood, Detox Herbal Tea contains herbs that cleanse, detox and support healthy blood pressure. Diuretics help increase bile production which break down, bind, and excrete toxins from the body while supporting the kidneys and bladder in eliminating waste and excess fluid. This tea assists in the removal of toxins by binding to toxic metals to extract them from various tissues. The healing and support of the body's systems comes from anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antibacterial properties to protect and support the regeneration of healthy cells. Flavor Profile: Detox Herbal Tea is a complex and delicious blend that offers a bold, savory flavor with grassy notes and a subtle warming spice. The Burdock Root and Turmeric give the tea a grounding, earthy flavor, while the Cilantro Leaf and Ginger Root add a bright, spicy kick. The Nettle Leaf and Parsley Leaf give Detox Herbal Tea a gentle, grassy sweetness. Botanicals: Burdock Root: Burdock Root helps to purify the blood. The burdock plant contains active ingredients in its root system that can remove toxins from the bloodstream, detoxifying and increasing circulation to the surface of the skin. Cilantro Leaf: Cilantro Leaf is a chelator, meaning that it can bind to heavy metals and allow the body to excrete them. Cilantro leaf also has diuretic qualities which helps the body to rid itself of excess fluid. It is full of antioxidants, in a powerful anti-inflammatory herb, and nutrient dense with high levels of vitamins A, B, C, E, K, folate, iron, calcium, magnesium, and potassium. Dandelion Root may help improve the secretion of insulin, the hormone that regulates blood sugar levels, as well as the absorption of glucose in the muscles leading to improved insulin sensitivity and lower blood sugar levels. Ginger Root: Ginger Root reduces inflammation and stimulates digestions, all while suppressing the appetite. The compounds, gingerols, are responsible for improving digestion and stabilizing blood sugar levels. By decreasing blood pressure, Ginger Root prevents the formation of blood clots in the arteries and blood vessels, improving circulation. [Milk Thistle Seed:](https://vanatisanes.com/2018/10/18/milk-thistle-seeds/) Milk Thistle Seed contains active ingredients that are plant compounds collectively known as silymarin. Silymarin protects the liver against toxins while improving its function and reducing inflammation. By reducing damage to the liver caused by toxins and free radicals, the liver is able to metabolize these toxic substances. Nettle Leaf: Nettle Leaf is full of antioxidants, vitamins and minerals which helps defend your cells from damage caused by free radicals. It stimulates nitric oxide production, which acts as a vasodilator, meaning that it relaxes constricted blood vessels. Nettle Leaf has compounds that act as calcium channel blockers, which relax the heart by reducing the force of contractions. It is also helpful in lowering blood pressure while raising the heart's antioxidant defenses. Parsley Leaf: Parsley Leaf is a natural diuretic which helps to cleanse infectious organisms from the bladder to help speed up recovery from UTIs and prevention of kidney stones. By helping to increase urination, decrease calcium excretion, and raise the acidity of urine, Parsley also aids in the treatment of kidney stones. [Turmeric:](https://vanatisanes.com/2018/04/18/turmeric/) Turmeric has powerful anti-inflammatory properties and one of its active ingredients, curcumin, helps to improve the function of the endothelium or the lining of the heart and blood vessels.
