This book is a holistic, natural and positive guide to inspire and support caregivers and parents. Paperback | 112pp | \u00a38.99How can we provide appropriate boundaries for children while adapting as children grow? In these extracts from Why Children Need Boundaries , experienced kindergarten teacher and educational consultant Lo\u00efs Eijgenraam offers guidance on the sensory development of children from birth to seven years, and champions the value of learning through play. attention to children's signals from birth, and learning how to respond appropriately, helps them develop a strong sense of life. Children who receive this attentive care know that they can trust themselves and their environment. The task of parents and caregivers is to care for all children's bodily functions so that they can sustain independently working organs each with their own purpose. This is achieved by, among other things, supporting the development of the senses. The sense of movement develops primarily between the first and third year. During this phase children are busy learning to sit, crawl, walk and climb. Through falling and learning to get back up again children develop During this early stage of life, children's bodily senses develop, which lay the physical foundations for all children's inner and outer experiences. Through the sense of touch , children experience the boundaries of their bodies: I am here, the world begins there. They begin to experience objects, such as toys or the side of the crib, as being separate from themselves. From this, children gradually establish their own inner world and learn to differentiate between 'me and someone else', an important step in becoming an independent human being and developing a strong sense of self. Our skin is the organ that lets us experience the sense of touch. Through the sense of life children experience how their body is doing: whether they are hungry, thirsty or tired. It allows children to recognise whether they feel at ease in themselves and with others, whether they are 'comfortable in their own skin', in harmony with themselves and the world. Paying close resilience. Through a healthy dose of frustration they develop will power and perseverance, as shown when children learn to walk or in kindergarten when they learn to tie their shoelaces. If we look at learning to walk, every child does this in a unique way. If we leave children in a baby walker that keeps them upright, we deprive them of learning by trial and error, of achieving something all on their own. Learning to walk, ride a bike or tidy their rooms by themselves all allow children to develop their will. Parents offer a safe haven in which all of this can take place. The amount of space given depends on the age of the child, the parents' approach to parenting, and the circumstances in which the child is being raised. Over time children explore what is possible within the safe boundaries laid down by their parents; this safety net enables children to feel freer and more confident in discovering the world. The sense of movement does not only relate to physical movement but also to a child's changing emotions and their capacity to be moved: a baby calms down when we sing, young children become restless when a storm is building, a story with lots of repetition gives toddlers and kindergartners exactly the predictability they need. Just as children need to get a feel for their physical sense of balance when they are learning to walk or ride a bike, so too do they need to develop an emotional balance in order to navigate the world around them. In this regard, as in so many others, all children are unique. Some cry more quickly than others, not because they are prone to overreact but because they are more sensitive: their inner equilibrium, or balance, is more easily thrown off. Some children never seem to get thrown off at all: they take everything in their stride. It's important to observe children closely and with love and empathy so we can establish rules and boundaries that support their own individual needs. Play is something innate which children must do. A young toddler plays alone. At this age, children have so much to discover about themselves and the world around them that they do not have energy or capability to also play with someone else. Older toddlers start playing next to their peers, and sometimes run into each other while playing. Soon they will take the first steps towards playing together: one child is the 'father' or 'mother', the other is the 'child'. Older kindergartners, five to six years of age, develop a more advanced form of playing together, which can be called imaginative or cooperative play. They plan together, collect everything they need and, while playing, the game develops. Not until later in their development will one child be in charge of the game and the other children agree to have one child in charge. These various types of play help build children's social skills. The only prerequisite is that children are given sufficient time and space for their play. Children whose schedules are filled with sports, music, ballet, play-dates and babysitters have too little time to play on their own. Valuing free play also means letting go, leaving children alone and not asking unnecessary questions such as: 'What are you doing? Are you having fun?' Children need the freedom to play independently without being disturbed. One of the purposes of play is to process experiences. During play, children can become someone else and this can help them regain their balance. For example, a kindergartner goes to the doctor with an earache. The doctor examines the girl's ear with a lamp and then puts drops in her ear. All this makes a great impression on the child. Once home, the child's dolls, bear and other stuffed animals all have their ears checked. The child pretends to be the doctor and processes the experience through play. In another situation, she will be able to revert back to this moment. The more experiences lived through and processed in play, the more children can learn from them. Positive memories help to create a sense of trust in the world. When trust in the world grows, self-confidence also grows and this provides a solid foundation for the development of good social skills.

It is the first of three volumes celebrating one hundred years of Waldorf education. 150+ b/w illus | HB | of Steiner-Waldorf Education, Nana G\u00f6bel tells the story of the growth of this revolutionary schools movement. Here, we share an extract exploring the founding principles of this innovative approach to learning. from many individuals and groups, both local and further afield, who supported the Verein f\u00fcr ein Freies Schulwesen [World School Association] and only to a small extent on direct tuition and contributions from well-to-do parents. Waldorf pedagogy is often seen as one of the many attempts at school reform at the beginning of the 20th century. A call for 'child centered' education was on everybody's lips at that time. In the form that Ellen Key chose, it even became a motto for the 20th century. It goes without saying that Waldorf pedagogy is part of a larger movement toward renewal of education in this time and that it shares some basic ideas with the various attempts at school reform. But the most important, and at the same time most controversial, basis is unique to Waldorf, namely that it is rooted in the anthroposophical view Right from the start, two impulses came together in the founding of the Waldorf schools: a pedagogical and a social impulse. On the one hand, the foundations for an education toward freedom had to be developed, on the other hand, the school had to truly serve the community. The school was open for children of all social and economic backgrounds. Children from the most diverse families and strata of society were to have the chance to learn together, grow up together, and build up a friendly understanding amongst themselves. In this endeavor, an important contribution was to be made in building up a society not split into different segments, but held together by the glue which is formed when mutual understanding is built through sharing experiences and doing things together. This was not always easy because the Waldorf School in Stuttgart did not receive any public funds from the time of its founding until it was closed in 1938 and, instead, depended mostly on the private capital of Emil Molt and the Waldorf Astoria Corporation. It depended further on the contributions of the human being. And there is no doubt that the initiators of the first Waldorf School shared a longing for a fundamental renewal of education and wanted to do their bit to grow beyond common school practices such as rote learning and iron discipline. Of equal importance to the direct pedagogical practice in the school for which Rudolf Steiner prepared the future teachers was the propagation of the larger aim of freedom in education for society in general. This did not result in dogmatically insisting on this principle because Rudolf Steiner was willing to make compromises when needed, which was actually quite unlike him. Such compromises had to be made for the Waldorf school on the Uhlandsh\u00f6he in Stuttgart both with regard to the school entrance age and the duration of elementary school time. Steiner was fully conscious of the fact that the school movement would have to grow considerably in size in order to unfold the needed larger effect within society as a whole and to realize the aim of more freedom in education. For that reason, it was Rudolf Steiner's intention right from the beginning to found not just one school but hundreds of schools. Then as now, the point was that free human beings can only be educated in free schools. For Steiner, the word \"free\" in this context meant freedom from state intervention in education to begin with. In a positive sense, \"free\" meant that the innovative strength of each teacher to shape the lessons out of both psychological considerations and insights into the subject had to be safeguarded. \"Free\" also meant teachers being free and independent in basing their teaching on the particular students they had in front of them. For the individual teachers that meant the freedom to work without a prescribed and limiting curriculum as well. Freedom in education and the reduction of governmental oversight were part of the concepts of the movement for social threefolding. Rudolf Steiner wanted to bring about a true change in society and open up real developmental opportunities for people by means of a completely different school structure. Freedom did not mean license for him, but rather a high degree of inner moral responsibility, something which can be seen in the way he described in his book, The Philosophy of Freedom , the inner path of development we need to tread in order to achieve freedom. In this respect, the ideal to found a school in which human dignity is valued was at the heart of the Waldorf school movement right from its inception. \"Children from the most diverse families and strata of society were to have the chance to learn together.\" \"Rudolf Steiner wanted to bring about a true change in society and open up real developmental opportunities for people by means of a completely different school structure.\" \"Then as now, the point was that free human beings can only be educated in free schools.\" \"The initiators of the first Waldorf School shared a longing for a fundamental renewal of education.\" Left: The first Waldorf school, 1927.

With this awareness, we can make conscious choices, which serve all life. Spin a Scarf of Sunshine offers a picture of wholeness, which, I hope, is both affirming and inspiring. In your experience, why do you think stories are so important for children? Ben Okri said: \"Stories can heal profound sicknesses of the spirit... Stories work with all the internal Stories, cycles and sunshine What inspired you to write Spin a Scarf of Sunshine ? My love of knitting and my love of nature. Why do you think it's important to teach children about cycles in nature? We live at a point in history when for decades consumer culture has promoted a way of life that is disconnected from nature. It has been considered normal to buy 'stuff' without awareness of how things are made, or where they end up once they have been used. The result of that disconnect has been deforestation, ocean pollution, land desecration, species extinction and climate crisis. At last, I see change; I see all around me the awakening of a new environmental consciousness, and I feel relief, and hopeful excitement. I believe it is important for all of us, children and adults alike, to understand the connections between our daily lives and the web of life; materials of the mind and self. They become part of you while changing you ... beneath the waters of consciousness, they are altering your world ... Change the stories individuals or nations live by and tell themselves, and you change the individuals and nations.\" Stories speak direct to the soul in the language of dreams; like dreams, they unfold, from image to image, universal archetypes that resonate within us. Stories are to the soul as food is to the body. Just as we nourish our children's bodies with wholesome food to help them grow healthy and well, so we can give them wholesome stories, to nourish their spirits and nurture their inner growth. What is the key message you would like to share with this book? For me, part of the magic of stories is that they are open, offering many meanings. A single story can offer different wisdom or healing at different Dawn Casey is a children's author inspired by the wonder of the natural world. She has previously worked in publishing and as a primary school teacher. Stila Lim is an illustrator based in Seoul, South Korea. Spin a Scarf of Sunshine is her first picture book.Spin a Scarf of Sunshine follows Nari as she cares for a little lamb on her farm.

Hardback | 32pp | \u00a312.99The world's natural rhythms are wonderful subjects to be explored and celebrated with children. We spoke to author Dawn Casey about the importance of stories, her love of wool and her new picture book, Spin a Scarf of Sunshine , which delights in the turning of the seasons and the cycles of nature.points in our lives, depending on what is current for us at that moment. We each receive just what we need from a story. For me, Spin a Scarf of Sunshine is a song of praise to the beautiful connectedness of all life. It is also a celebration of the pleasure of knitting! Do you knit like Nari? What have you made with wool? Yes, I love knitting! I love the softness of the wool and the smoothness of the wood in my hands. I find the rhythm of knitting soothing, meditative almost. I use pure wool, my favourite yarn is organic and chunky. I enjoy playing with natural dyes, the colours have far more depth and richness than chemical dyes. Over the years, I have knitted cardigans and shawls, scarves and hats, cuddly cats and snuggly bunnies, for my children and for my nieces, and for many beloved dolls and soft toys! Over the years, my children and I have also enjoyed making many lovely things from felted wool, both as gifts and for our nature table, as well as book-marks and notebook-covers, balls for babies and glasses cases for grandmas, Easter eggs and spring chicks, summer birds and autumn acorns, birthday crowns and Christmas stars. When my children were little, before they knew how to knit, they created yards and yards of finger- knitting and fork-knitting. I warmly recommend finger-knitting as a lovely way for very young children to enjoy wool. Wool is one of my favourite things! I imagine and hope that Spin a Scarf of Sunshine will be a gorgeous gift book, especially given along with a hand-knitted little lamb! \"Just as we nourish our children's bodies with wholesome food to help them grow healthy and well, so we can give them wholesome stories, to nourish their spirits and nurture their inner growth.\" Why not share your own knitted lambs with us on social media? @FlorisBooks Click here for a knitted lamb tutorial.

Then spring came, and everywhere was alive with blossoms and birds. Yet in the garden of the selfish giant it was still winter. Because there were no children, the birds did not sing and the trees did not bloom. The snow and the frost were the only ones who were pleased. \"Spring has forgotten this garden,\" they cried, \"so we will live here all year round.\" The snow covered the grass with her great white cloak, and the frost painted all the trees silver. Once there was an enormous giant's castle beside a small village. The giant had been away for many years. Every day after school, the village children played in the castle garden. It was a large and lovely garden, with soft green grass, beautiful flowers and peach trees that bore delicate blossoms in spring and rich fruit in autumn. But then the giant came back. He had been to visit his friend the Cornish ogre. Striding up to his castle, the giant found children playing all around it. \"What are you doing here?\" he shouted, and the frightened children ran away. \"My own garden is my own garden,\" said the giant, \"and I will allow nobody to play in it but me.\" So he built a high wall around it and put up a sign that read: TRESPASSERS WILL BE EATEN He was a very selfish giant. The poor children had nowhere to play. They would wander around the Then they invited the north wind. Wrapped in furs, he roared around the garden all day. \"This is a delightful spot,\" he said. \"We must ask the hail to visit.\" So the hail came too. Dressed in grey, her breath was like ice. She rattled on the roof of the castle until she broke most of the slates, then stormed about the garden in a flurry. \"I cannot understand why spring is so late in coming,\" said the selfish giant, as he looked out at his cold white garden. \"I hope there will be a change in the weather.\" But spring never came, nor summer. The autumn gave fruit to every orchard, but to the giant's garden she gave none. \"He is too selfish,\" she said. So it Nurture courageous children by sharing inspiring stories. An Illustrated Collection of Fairy Tales for Brave Children , illustrated by Scott Plumbe, is full of emboldening tales where children face their fears. Why not share this classic tale of bravery and generosity from Oscar Wilde?The Selfish Giantwas always winter there, and the north wind and the hail and the frost and the snow danced through the bare trees. One morning the giant woke to the sound of a bird singing outside his window. Surprised, he peered out and saw that the hail had stopped dancing and the north wind had ceased roaring. \"Spring has come at last!\" he cried. Through a little hole in the wall, the children had crept into the garden. They were sitting in the branches of the trees, which were covered with blossom. Birds twittered with delight, and the flowers danced. But in one corner, it was still winter. A little boy stood crying by a snow-covered tree. He was so small he couldn't reach the branches. The giant's heart melted. \"How selfish I have been! I will knock down the wall, and my garden shall be the children's playground forevermore.\" But when the children saw the giant, they ran away and winter returned. Only the little boy remained. The giant gently lifted him into the tree, and it burst into bloom. Unafraid, the boy flung his arms around the giant's neck and kissed him. When the other children saw, they came running back, and spring came with them. \"It is your garden now, children,\" said the giant, and he knocked down the wall. The children played all day. When they said goodbye, the giant asked for the small boy who hadn't been afraid. \"He's gone,\" the children answered. And though they returned to play every afternoon, they never saw the little boy again.

Underneath stood the little boy from long ago. The giant rushed to him, asking, \"Are you alright? You are still a boy... Who are you?\" \"I am the child of love,\" he answered. The giant was filled with wonder and knelt before the boy, who smiled and said, \"You let me play in your garden once. Today you shall come with me to mine, in Paradise.\" When the village children came to play that afternoon, the giant had gone.

But the enraged master's wife, Louhi, called for swordsmen to attack Lemmink\u00e4inen, and he was forced to flee. Yet in the yard his horse was nowhere to be seen. Lemmink\u00e4inen was anxious. He could already hear the rumble from the village, as Louhi's message travelled from house to house: \"Go after Lemmink\u00e4inen, men!\" He quickly transformed himself into an eagle and soared high into the sky. He arrived home feeling very sorry for himself. \"The men are sharpening their swords for me,\" he gloomily told his mother. \"I killed the master of Pohjola.\" \"I told you not to go,\" his mother said anxiously. \"You wretched creature, you are always looking to wage war and do battle. Soon you will lose your handsome head.\" There was nothing Lemmink\u00e4inen could do but flee. His mother advised him to hide on an island beyond nine seas, where Lemmink\u00e4inen's father had also hidden during years of war. Handsome Lemmink\u00e4inen took a sack of provisions, pushed a boat onto the water and sailed away. tongues, writhed in front of the gate and snapped at Lemmink\u00e4inen. But he remembered the words of creation for a snake, which his mother had taught him. If he sang them correctly, the serpent's power would diminish. \"Serpent, you are kin to the ogress and the evil water sprite,\" Lemmink\u00e4inen shouted. \"Soon you will swell up and burst! Get out of my way, you vile worm!\" When it heard Lemmink\u00e4inen speak his words of power, the serpent slowly slithered away. After surviving so many dangers, Lemmink\u00e4inen was even more eager to join the celebrations at Pohjola. He yanked open the door to Louhi's house and bounded right to the middle of the room. \"Greetings!\" Lemmink\u00e4inen shouted, quite unashamed of his rudeness. \"Master of Pohjola, does this house have ale to offer a wedding guest?\" \"Yes,\" the master replied from the head of the table, displeased to find Lemmink\u00e4inen in his house. \"If you behave yourself and sit by the kitchen door, like all uninvited guests.\" Lemmink\u00e4inen grimaced. \"I will never sit there. Bring me some ale!\" A tankard was placed before him. Inside, snakes were slithering, worms were squirming and lizards were writhing. Lemmink\u00e4inen threw them all on the floor and sliced off their heads with his knife. Then he drank the ale and demanded more. The master of Pohjola became angry. He also knew how to do magic and he conjured a puddle of water onto the floor. \"Drink from that!\" \"I am not a calf,\" Lemmink\u00e4inen shouted, and onto the floor he chanted Lemmink\u00e4inen journeyed on to Pohjola, but suddenly his horse whinnied and came to a stop. Stretching forwards to see what had frightened his steed, Lemmink\u00e4inen saw that his mother had been right when she predicted he would encounter great danger. In front of him lay a fiery river, and in the rapids was a fiery island, and high on the island was a fiery eagle. Flames shot out of its wide-open beak, and its feathers bristled with sparks. Yet Lemmink\u00e4inen was not afraid. He remembered the enchanted feathers in his pocket, pulled them out and rubbed them between his palms. All at once, from the hollow of his hand, a flock of great black birds rose into the air. Lemmink\u00e4inen guided the birds into the monstrous eagle's gaping beak. The fire in the eagle's mouth died down as it was forced to devour the flock of black birds. And so Lemmink\u00e4inen was able to continue his journey. The horse galloped onwards until again it suddenly snorted with fright. Once more, Lemmink\u00e4inen's mother had While Ilmarinen and the Maid of Pohjola were celebrating their wedding, Lemmink\u00e4inen was ploughing his fields. Yet his keen hearing picked up the noise of the wedding feast all the way from Pohjola. Although the bride and groom had good reason not to invite Lemmink\u00e4inen, nevertheless he was annoyed when he realised that he had been left out. Lemmink\u00e4inen abandoned his ploughing and hurried home. \"Heat up the sauna!\" he ordered his mother. \"And bring me my armour and weapons! I am going to the wedding.\" His mother and his wife, Kyllikki, both tried to talk him out of it. They warned him not to attend the wedding, because he had not been invited and he might be welcomed by men with swords. His mother also predicted that he would face many dangers on his journey. But reckless Lemmink\u00e4inen did not listen. He took his father's powerful sword and bow, hastily harnessed his horse and set off. After riding for a while, Lemmink\u00e4inen saw a flock of black grouse on the road ahead. Frightened by the approaching hooves, the birds fluttered away. Yet they left some feathers behind. Knowing that such feathers were magical, Lemmink\u00e4inen slipped them into his pocket.correctly predicted that he would meet danger: a fiery ditch filled with burning rocks extended across the road and far into the distance. Yet Lemmink\u00e4inen was unperturbed. He raised a mighty blizzard and made it snow upon the blazing ditch until the flames were put out. Next he conjured an icy bridge across, and so he continued his journey. He was close to his destination when suddenly the horse stopped again. A bear lay in wait on the road ahead, and beyond it, at the gate to Pohjola, there was a wolf. Lemmink\u00e4inen merely took some curls of lamb's wool from his purse, rubbed them in his hands and blew them into the air. Immediately the wool curls transformed into sheep. The bear and wolf attacked the flock, leaving Lemmink\u00e4inen free to continue. But when he reached the farmyard of Pohjola, it was surrounded by a palisade of pure steel that reached a hundred fathoms underground and a thousand fathoms up into the sky. Spears bristled on top and snakes hissed between the rails. His mother had also foretold this danger. Lemmink\u00e4inen was not afraid. He calmly pulled out his father's sword and slashed at the palisade, slicing through snake-ridden rails and opening up the steel fence. The most terrible serpent of them all, with a hundred eyes and a thousand The Kalevala , the well-known Finnish saga, is filled with exciting stories featuring fiery rivers, slithering serpents and soaring eagles which offer important lessons for young minds. In this extract, we follow Lemmink\u00e4inen's journey to Pohjola, where a magical battle awaits!A lavishly illustrated epic a bull that quickly drank the puddle dry. The master of Pohjola sang a wolf into existence to kill the bull, but Lemmink\u00e4inen sang a rabbit to draw the wolf's attention. The master sang a dog to kill the rabbit and Lemmink\u00e4inen, in turn, a squirrel to tease the dog. The master's pine marten caught the squirrel, but Lemmink\u00e4inen's fox devoured the marten. The master conjured a hen to coax the fox, but Lemmink\u00e4inen sang a hawk, which snapped up the hen in an instant. The disgusted master roared from the head of the table, \"Enough! Leave now, unwelcome guest\" But Lemmink\u00e4inen did not move a muscle. The master of Pohjola grabbed his flaming sword from off the wall and challenged Lemmink\u00e4inen to a duel. The master of Pohjola tried to slash off his opponent's head, but instead hit a rafter and cut it in half. They moved their fight outside. Lemmink\u00e4inen's fiery sword sparked in his hand, and he slashed just once. The master only had time to wonder at the force of the blow before his head fell to the ground like the top sliced off a turnip. Lemmink\u00e4inen grabbed the head and stuck it on a stake. Then he marched insolently into the house and Kirsti M\u00e4kinen (1939-2016) was a lecturer in Finnish language and literature.

Out came each man's flint and steel. The men lit pine-brand torches. Each with a torch in his hand, they strode into that still hall. No one sat on the long bench. No one sat on the high seat. Yet an ale vat stood in the midst of the hall, and food on the long table. Torch in hand, the men went from the hall into the long sleeping room. A sheepskin rug lay on each wide berth. But no man lay asleep there. Kornar the Monk shook his head. \"I do not like it, Lord,\" he said to King Olaf. \"I think this must be a hall of ill name and ill fame. Ill things have power at midnight in such a place.\" \"It is here we spend the night or out in the mist,\" said King Olaf. \"Of the two, is not this the better place?\" The men set the pine-brand torches along the walls. They lit fires. They drew ale. They sat down to eat and drink. When it was time to rest, King Olaf said, \"No man is to set foot alone in KKing Olaf of Norway was out in the dales with a band of his men when a thick mist came up. The track they rode along grew less and less clear. At last it split into seven. \"This mist blots out all our landmarks,\" said King Olaf. \"Tell me, my men, which track is ours?\" One man said this track. The next man said that track. And all the time the mist grew thicker. Thorstan the Icelander was with King Olaf. \"What do you counsel, Thorstan?\" the king asked him. \"Lord,\" said Thorstan, \"it is clear we have lost our way. Our men's wits cannot hope to find it. All we can do is grope in the mist, for it is now so thick that I cannot see my hand before my face. But our steeds have other wits than ours. Let them pick the way. If a homestead is near, I think they will take us to it.\" \"That is good counsel,\" said King Olaf. So each man let his reins hang slack. King Olaf's steed began to sniff the mist to left and right. Then it began to pick its way along one of the tracks. The other steeds came after. Soon King Olaf saw the wall of a hall loom up in the mist. He got down from his steed, strode to the porch, and gave three loud raps on the door. All was still within. No one came to unbar the door. No sound of song or mirth came out to King Olaf and his men. \"Let me try, Lord,\" said Thorstan. He gave the door a mighty rap. The door swung wide. Outside, it had grown dark, and all was dark and still within.this hall this night. The berths in the sleeping room are wide; you will sleep two and two. If a man has need to get up in the night, he must wake his bed- mate and take him with him. Do you hear, my men?\" \"We hear, Lord,\" said his men. \"All Icelanders are famed for being full of self-will,\" said King Olaf. \"Do you hear, Thorstan?\" \"I hear, Lord,\" said Thorstan. But at midnight Thorstan woke up. As he lay awake in his berth, he began to think. He said to himself, \"Much do I marvel why the King said no man must set foot alone in the hall this night. I have a mind to get up and go and find out.\" Thorstan lay still a while. The snores of his bed-mate told him he was fast asleep. At last he rose, and set his feet in his sandals. Over his back he cast the sheepskin rug from his bed. Out of the sleeping room and into the hall he stole. The pine-brand torches had been put out, but a glow from all that was left of the fires still lay on the hall. By this dim red light, Thorstan found a horn and drew ale. He drank, then went to the bench. With the horn of ale in his hand, and with the sheepskin rug over his back, he sat down to wait. Thorstan began to look about him in the dim glow from the fires. Soon he saw a slight stir in the gloom at the far end of the hall. It was as if some small Norse Myths and Viking Legends brings together thrilling tales of power and cunning, magic and destiny, artfully retold by Isabel Wyatt . In this story, 'Thorstan Shiver', one of King Olaf's men fails to heed an important warning.Epic sagas and dramatic talesthing rose up out of the floor. \"Who sits there in the gloom?\" asked Thorstan. \"An imp,\" said the small thing at the far end of the hall. And as he spoke, he came a step closer. \"Where do you come from?\" \"From hell,\" said the imp. \"Tell me about that said Thorstan. \"Who bears his pain best there?\" \"Sigurd the Dragon-Slayer,\" said the imp. And as he spoke, he came a step closer. \"What pain has he?\" asked Thorstan. \"He fires an oven,\" said the imp. \"That does not seem a great pain for so great a hero to bear.\" \"Indeed it is,\" said the imp. \"For he himself is the fire.\" And as he spoke, he came a step closer. \"Indeed, that is a great pain, then. And who bears his pain worst?\" \"Starkad the Old,\" said the imp. \"He whoops and he whoops with his pain, so that we imps get no rest for his whooping.\" And as he spoke, he came a step closer. \"What pain has he?\" asked Thorstan. \"He is on fire up to his shins,\" said the imp. \"That does not seem a great pain for so great a hero to bear.\" \"Indeed it is,\" said the imp. \"For he is on fire up to his shins as he stands on his head.\" And as he spoke, he came a step closer. \"Indeed, that is a great pain, then. Can you show me how he whoops?\" \"I can,\" said the imp. And he threw back his head, and he drew in his breath, and he whooped a great whoop, and he came a step closer. \"Is that how he whoops?\" asked Thorstan. \"Is that his biggest whoop?\" \"Indeed it is not,\" said the imp. \"That is only the whoop of a little imp like me.\" And as he spoke, he came a step closer. \"Whoop a little more like Starkad\" \"I will,\" said the imp. And he threw back his head, and he drew in his breath, and he whooped a mighty whoop, and he came a step closer. \"Is that his biggest whoop?\" \"It is not,\" said the imp. \"It is no bigger than his smallest.\" And as he spoke, he came a step closer. \"Whoop me now his biggest whoop.\" \"I will,\" said the imp. \"And then I shall be so close that I can clutch you. And then you will be mine.\" And he threw back his head, and he drew in his breath, and he whooped so mighty a whoop that Thorstan had to put his hands over his ears. And he came the last step closer. But as he put out his arm to clutch Thorstan, Kornar the Monk's holy bell began to ring. And at that sound the imp sank into the floor, and all in the hall was still. Then Thorstan drank the rest of the ale in his horn, and rose from the bench, and stole back into the sleeping room. Isabel Wyatt (1901-1992) was born in England and wrote many books for children. She spent years teaching young children and was then, until her retirement in 1965, co-director of studies at Hawkwood College in Gloucestershire.Thorstan Shiver is just one selection from Norse Myths and Viking Legends ; a thrilling collection of Norse Tales for children, including the epic sagas 'The Saga of King Ragnar Goatskin', .

At dawn the men got up, and King Olaf went to pray. When he came back, he asked, \"Did any man go alone into the hall last night?\" Then Thorstan rose, bent his head and said, \"Lord, I did.\" \"Ah,\" said King Olaf. \"Men say truly that you Icelanders are full of self-will. And what did you see in the hall?\" Thorstan told him. \"And why did you ask the imp to whoop?\" asked King Olaf. \"Lord,\" said Thorstan, \"when I saw him step ever closer, I began to see why you had told us not to go alone into the hall. And I said to myself that his whooping might wake you up, Lord, and I might get help from you.\" \"So it did; and so you did,\" said King Olaf. \"For I had Kornar the Monk ring his holy bell to that end. Were you much afraid at his whooping?\" \"Afraid is a thing I have never been,\" said Thorstan. \"But so mighty was that last whoop, I did feel a sort of shiver.\" At this, King Olaf held his sides with mirth. Then he cried in glee, \"Thorstan Shiver shall be your nickname from now on, and I will give you this sword as a gift to fasten the name.\" And King Olaf gave him a sword that later stood him in good stead. And that was how Thorstan Shiver got his nickname. \"I cannot see my hand before my face. But our steeds have other wits than ours. Let us let them pick a way for us.

Before drawing, decide on a back ground colour, which should be paler than the colour used for the figure. Draw the form on the paper lightly in pencil. Next, using the colour you have chosen for the figure, start plaiting: over and under, over and under. Cover the surrounding area with the background colour until the pencilled guidelines disappear. Will the end result look 'correct' if you plait alternately over and under? If a pupil finds that this doesn't work, ask them to check carefully that they have gone over and under. It should always work. Encouraging children to experiment with their own interpretations in form drawing is crucial to developing their aesthetic instincts. These inspiring exercises from Henrik Thaulow's Living Lines are perfect to try with Class 5.Plaiting and problem-solvingAesthetic problem-solving This is a demanding exercise, so try it out yourself first and then decide if your pupils are ready to attempt it. In class, allow pupils to sit together in problem-solving groups so they can deal with obstacles that arise. Ask pupils to draw this wavy line in a circle, then superimpose the same type of wavy line on top. The next step is to create examples using fewer waves: try eight, then seven, six, five and so on, for as long as this is possible. Henrik Thaulow is a class teacher in Waldorf Schools, and a lecturer at the Steiner College in Oslo. He trained at the Granum Painting School in Oslo and the Goetheanist Study Centre in Vienna where Form Drawing was the subject of his master's thesis.Living Lines is a practical and inspiring full-colour book for Steiner-Waldorf teachers, offering new ways to teach form drawing. It includes over one hundred form drawing exercises for Classes 2-5. Paperback | 192pp | \u00a320.00 Decorations Simple or complex plaits can be used for borders and corners. Encourage your pupils to experiment with different designs. Start using a simple form and build upon this by dividing lines and joining them together in new ways. The three forms below consist of two simple and identically formed lines (imagine using threads or rope to achieve the same results).Plaited patterns Experiment with one, two or three rows of dots. This is a continuation of a technique introduced in Class 4, but now ask your pupils to develop the form to make braided patterns. When using two rows there will always be loose ends, while three rows result in one or more continuous lines. Allow pupils to discover this themselves if they haven't explored this area before. In this way they can discover additional and more advanced braided patterns. Sculpting figures Pupils can 'sculpt' figures in a pale colour before providing definition with edge lines and plaiting, as shown. Metamorphoses Start with the fourth figure in the top row and transform it in both directions, as shown. Allow your pupils to try themselves and see how far they get. Let them work together once the task is complete to discuss results and the process. Additional exercise Drawing these three forms will give pupils who need an extra challenge something to work on.Juxtaposition To achieve this figure, start with the form drawn with a thick line, as it is simpler, and draw the form with the thinner line around it. Are there other ways to weave forms into one another? Consider these final examples. Plaited heart border The challenge in these forms is to keep the heart shape in mind even when it is upside down. These forms need practice and preparation. Consider whether your pupils are capable of this yet.

How beautiful, how balanced, how well judged, how is everything so in place that the senses are not harmed? Secondly, of course, we offer parent education and adult learning. Many Waldorf schools have that, but not all parents are able to, or do attend. Concentrate on the hours you have with the children and do your very best for them, but also offer to the parents as much as possible about how they can protect and nurture their children at home. Can we really understand how the sense of beauty needs to be nourished through the senses? We need to expose the etheric body repeatedly to beautiful sense impressions in order to develop the aesthetic sense, which is this combination of the etheric and the astral. Therefore in our curriculum we have so much activity in kindergarten and the first school years where singing and playing music is done alongside painting and free play. Later we can practice speech exercises, communication exercises, little plays and performances and dramas, in which children can learn to experience all these aesthetic activities. In our artistic lessons on color, we can ask, \"Which is more beautiful? Is it when the blue is within and the yellow surrounds it, or is it the other way round?\" These manifold aesthetic questions help. The teacher learns to draw in front of the class so that the children can imitate a person struggling with the beautiful. It can be awkward or discouraging during a lesson if the teacher were to open the blackboard to reveal to the children only the 'perfect' end result of their strivings. It is better not to show such a ready-made picture, but to draw in front of the children. The drawing can be simpler, or use your holidays to take a painting course, to learn what you want your children to learn. If you think the children will learn to do something that you are not able to, or if you are not willing to learn, then they cannot copy you and will dislike your teaching. And yet they need to copy you. Using our senses, we are lifelong imitators. We copy what we see, we sense what we see, and therefore teachers need to be models when we What does the future of education look like? Dr Michaela Gl\u00f6ckler explores the importance of the development of the aesthetic sense in this extract from Truth, Beauty and Goodness . Exploring the pillars of truth want to develop the sense for beauty. We need really to be models in all that we do and strive to be better, a little bit at a time. As a striving human being, to get the best possible from your children, you might even say in your class, \"Who can make this freehand circle more round than I was able to? I am not so skilled maybe as some of you.\" Be honest, and then the sense for the beautiful can develop. It is a process. It is not a miracle, it falls not from heaven. It needs years to develop. Dr Michaela Gl\u00f6ckler is a former head of the Medical Section at the Goetheanum in Dornach, Switzerland and is also an anthroposophical pediatrician. She is the author of many books on child health and development.Truth, Beauty and Goodness draws on Gl\u00f6ckler's lectures to discuss the three pillars of truth (science), beauty (art) and goodness (religion), exploring their impact on social life and Waldorf education in particular.
