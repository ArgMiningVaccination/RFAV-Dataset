Astin, PhD, Karen Soeken, PhD, Victor S. Sierpina, MD, and Brian R. Clarridge, PhD Purpose: Examine physicians' attitudes toward the incorporation of psychosocial factors in diagnosis and treatment and identify barriers to the integration of evidence-based mind-body methods. Method: Random sample of primary care physicians and physicians from selected non-primary spe- cialties was drawn. A total of 1058 physicians completed a 12-page survey. Results: The response rate was 27%. Although a majority of physicians seem to recognize the impor- tance of addressing psychosocial issues, approximately one third believe that addressing such factors would lead to minimal or no improvements in outcomes. A minority reports their training regarding therole of psychosocial factors was effective, and relatively few indicate interest in receiving further train-ing in these areas. Males were less likely to believe in the importance of addressing psychosocial factors. Additional factors included perceptions that training was poor in these areas; feelings of low self-efcacy to ad-dress psychosocial issues and the perception that such factors are difcult to control; lack of knowledgeof the evidence-base supporting the role of psychosocial factors; and lack of time and inadequate reim-bursement to address the psychosocial domain. Conclusions: These results suggest the need for more comprehensive training in the role of psycho- social factors in health. In addition, the nding that physicians identify lack of time and inadequate re-imbursement as signicant barriers suggests that the current health care delivery system may, in manyrespects, be antithetical to the biopsychosocial model. (J Am Board Fam Med 2006;19:557-65.) The call for greater recognition of the role of psychological and sociocultural factors in medicineis certainly not new. Engel 1published a seminal article almost 30 years ago calling for an expansionof the biomedical model to a biopsychosocial one.However, despite such calls for reform, studies sug-gest that psychosocial factors continue to be over-looked or frequently missed in clinical encoun-ters 2-7and tend to still be underemphasized inmedical education.8,9Studies also suggest that em- pirically supported mind-body interventions for such common health problems as pain and insom-nia 10,11are used by only a minority of patients suffering from these conditions.12 Consistent with these ndings, in October 2004, the National Institutes of Health issued a requestfor applications (RFA) focused on \"strengtheningbehavioral and social science curricula in medicalschool.\" This RFA grew out of an Institute ofMedicine report issued earlier that same year inwhich the authors noted that \"no physician's edu-cation would be complete without an understand-ing of the role played by behavioral and socialfactors in human health and disease, knowledge ofthe ways in which these factors can be modied,and an appreciation of how personal life experi-ences influence physician-patient relationships.\" Although there is a growing body of evidence pointing to the role that psychosocial factors suchas stress can play in health and illness, and thewell-accepted, contemporary value that medicalpractice should be grounded in solid scientic evi- This article was externally peer reviewed.

Downloaded from dence, it is also well documented that evidence of a given therapy's effectiveness is frequently insuf-cient to change clinical practice. 13Therefore, if medical training and practice are to move toward amodel that gives adequate attention to nonbiologi-cal (ie, psychosocial) concerns, the varied and com-plex barriers to integration must be identied andaddressed. 13,14 The present study reports the results of a na- tional survey of physicians that was designed toexamine attitudes toward the role of psychosocialfactors (eg, stress, emotional states) in medicine,and to identify factors that might account for dif-ferences in the extent to which physicians recognizethe importance of such factors in health and areopen to using mind-body approaches (such as re-laxation, stress management, meditation, and be-havioral counseling) in clinical practice. 11,12More specically, the study aimed to identify personal,attitudinal, and social-environmental factors thatfacilitate or inhibit physicians' openness to consid-ering psychosocial factors in diagnosis and treat-ment, and to seek a better understanding of the rolethat medical education plays in shaping physicians'attitudes and practice patterns relative to theseareas. Method In collaboration with researchers from the Centerfor Survey Research (CSR) at the University ofMassachusetts, Boston, we obtained a list of physi-cian mailing addresses from the American MedicalAssociation (AMA) master les. This list of poten-tial respondents was drawn from a broad spectrumof primary care specialties and a select group ofnon-primary care specialties. Primary care special-ties included family medicine, internal medicine,pediatrics, and obstetrics/gynecology. Several non-primary care specialties were selected includingrheumatology, gastroenterology, pain manage-ment, and cardiology. The principle we applied wasto include specialties that were in the front lines ofprimary care and/or whose practitioners might rea-sonably confront symptoms and diagnose condi-tions for which evidence-based mind-body meth-ods could be considered appropriate adjuncts tocare. 11 In May 2002, we conducted a series of focus groups with physicians (N /H1100522). This information was used, in part, to inform both domain and itemselection for the survey.15Once the questionnaire was formatted, CSR conducted cognitive inter-views (via telephone) with 20 physicians who com-pleted the measure to assess whether any itemsneeded to be revised or omitted. This feedbackresulted in several minor revisions that simpliedthe questionnaire's administration and clariedcertain test items. The nal questionnaire was 12pages in length and took approximately 20 minutesto complete. It contained 36 items that along withassessing basic demographic information, asked re-spondents about their attitudes toward the role ofpsychosocial factors in health, their perceptions oftraining in these areas, their use of mind-bodymethods in clinical practice, and their perspectiveon factors that might serve as barriers to the inte-gration of such methods. A Web-based version ofthe survey was also developed, giving respondentsthe option (in the mailed cover letter) to take thesurvey on-line at a designated URL. There are a number of terms that are used (often interchangeably and at times with slightly differentconnotations) by both researchers and clinicians todescribe the general topic area we were interestedin exploring. any confusion that might have re-sulted from our use of terms that respondents wereeither not familiar with, or for which they helddifferent interpretations, the questionnaire beganas follows: This survey asks for your views on the psycho-social aspects of patient care. The informationyou provide will help us clarify the currentstatus of mind-body medicine among practic-ing physicians. The terms \"psychosocial\" and\"mind-body\" refer to those approaches thatemphasize the role of nonphysical factors suchas stress, emotions, attitudes, and beliefs in thediagnosis and treatment of physical illness. Initially, a random sample of 3350 physicians (from the above disciplines) was drawn from theAMA master les. Of these, 3057 were deemedinterviewable (eg, appropriate specialty, valid tele-phone number or address). Physicians were mailedthe survey, along with a cover letter, fact sheet, andreturn envelope. A small monetary incentive was tobe included in the initial mailing but because of aclerical error at CSR, these were omitted.

Downloaded from what the effect of including an incentive would have been, CSR contributed an additional randomsample of 1000 physicians and mailed surveys with$20 incentives to these potential respondents. Forboth groups (incentive and no incentive), remindertelephone calls were begun approximately 14 daysafter the initial mailing. A second questionnairepacket was sent to all nonresponders, followed byanother series of follow-up phone calls. Results Response RateOf the original 3057 mailed surveys, 683 completedresponses were received (22%). A total of 18 phy-sicians (2.7%) opted to use the Web-based versionof the survey. For the second, incentivized mailing,completed surveys were received from 375 of 873eligible physicians constituting a signicantlyhigher response rate of 43%. The combined sam-ple used for all descriptive and multivariate analysesis N/H110051058, (overall response, 27%). Tests for nonresponse bias indicate that among physicians receiving no incentive, females weremore likely to respond, as were those who com-pleted medical school after 1995. For this reason,we weighted the nonincentivized sample to adjustfor these potential biases. Further analyses of the 2samples (incentivized and nonincentivized) indi-cated that respondents who did not receive a mon-etary incentive tended to hold slightly more favor-able attitudes toward the topic area (ie, theimportance of incorporating psychosocial factors intraining and practice). For this reason, we added\"receipt of incentive\" as a covariate in all analysesto control for this potential bias.

Use of Mind-Body Methods The majority of physicians seem to recognize theimportance of addressing the psychosocial domainin clinical practice. For example, in response to thequestion, \"What would be the overall improvementin treatment outcomes from increasing the appli-cation of psychosocial methods,\" two thirds (66%)indicate that including such methods would lead to\"moderate\" or \"big\" improvements (score of 3 or 4on a 4-point scale), compared with 34% who statethat such an addition would lead only to \"small\" or\"almost no\" improvements. Analysis of the 4 pri-mary care specialties included in our survey showedsmall but nonsignicant differences across groups,with 70% of family medicine physicians indicatingthat psychosocial methods would signicantly im-prove treatment outcomes, followed by pediatrics(68%), internal medicine (67%), and obstetrics-gynecology (65%). Respondents were given a list of representative mind-body interventions and asked to comment onthe extent to which they used and/or referred out toeach of these as part of their clinical practice.

Perceptions about Training A minority (25%) of respondents indicate that theirformal training (medical school, residency) was\"helpful\" (score of 4 or 5 on a 5-point scale) inlearning how to address the psychosocial domain(either diagnostically or in terms of actual treat-ment), whereas 44% rate the quality of their train-ing in these areas as \"not helpful\" (score of 1 or 2)(see Figure 2).Forty-three percent indicate that mentors in medical school did a good job with respect to di-agnosing psychosocial factors, whereas 24% saythat teachers effectively mentored them about in-cluding mind-body methods in treatment.

Approxi-mately one third of respondents indicate that committed\" and 49%\"somewhat committed.\" Multivariate Analyses In an effort to better understand potential barriersto the integration of the biopsychosocial model inmedicine, we examined the extent to which selectedvariables predict both attitudes toward, and prac-tice of, mind-body methods. Based on our review ofthe literature and the results from the focus groupswe had previously conducted, 15we hypothesized that the following predictors be analyses: lack ofclinical expertise (ie, low self-efcacy); perceptionsof control (ie, inability to influence psychosocialfactors); lack of time to address psychosocial issues;degree of social (peer) support; importance of reli-gion/spirituality, and personal use of mind-bodyapproaches. Because of missing data on some questionnaire items, the overall N (listwise present) for the re-gression analysis was 948, which represented 90%of the completed surveys. Of those excluded fromthis analytic sample, most (75%) failed to respondto only one of the variables included in the multi-variate analyses. Two dependent variables wereconsidered: belief in the \"value-added\" of mind-body methods (\"Attitude\"), and current clinical variables are signicantly correlated: r/H11005 0.43 (P /H11021.001). In all regression analyses, diagnos- tics indicate no evidence of multicollinearity andthe plot of standardized residuals suggested a nor-mal distribution with fewer than 1% of standard-ized residuals exceeding an absolute value of 3.0.Three cases, only 0.3% of the sample, were iden-tied as multivariate outliers based on Mahalanobisdistance but given the small number, they were notdeleted for analyses. Predictors of Attitude When the dependent variable, belief in the value-added of mind-body methods (\"Attitude\"), was ex-amined, the following variables emerged as statis-tically signicant in the regression (see Table 2): 1)belief that absence of demonstrably effectivemind-body techniques\" \"usefulness of personal use of mind-body therapies ( /H9252/H11005.15), 4) being female (/H9252/H11005.15), 5) belief that lack of ex-pertise does not limit use ( /H9252/H11005/H11002 .07), and 6) im- portance of religious/spiritual beliefs /H9252/H11005.06). Together, these factors explain 21.4% of the vari-ability in attitude toward mind-body issues (ad-justed R 2/H110050.205). These results indicate that phy - sicians who perceive increased value-added whenmind-body methods are used in concert with othermedical therapies are more likely to be female, ratetheir formal education as more useful in addressing Figure 3.

Downloaded from psychosocial issues, use mind-body methods for their own health more often, state that their spiri-tual/religious beliefs are important to them in theirwork, not feel that the absence of evidence (ofefcacy) limits their use of mind-body approaches,and believe that \"lack of expertise\" does limit theuse of such methods. Predictors of Practice When use of and/or referral to mind-body thera-pies (\"Practice\") was tested as the dependent vari-able in the regression, the following factorsemerged as signicant predictors: personal use beyond one's capacity tocontrol or influence\" ( /H9252/H11005/H11002 .07). The model t signicant ( P/H11021.001) with 20.3% of the variability explained by this set of predictors. Theseresults indicate that physicians who use and/or re-fer to mind-body therapies more frequently in clin-ical practice tend to report using such methods fortheir own health, rate their formal training as morehelpful, and are less likely to say that lack of exper-tise, poor evidence of efcacy, insufcient clinictime, and low feelings of perceived control (to in-fluence psychosocial factors) are signicant obsta-cles. Neither medical specialty nor year graduatedmedical school predicted either attitude toward orpractice of psychosocial/mind-body methods. As noted above, being female, using mind-body methods for one's own health, and believing thattraining in medical school and residency effectivelyaddressed these areas, each emerged as signicantpredictors of greater openness to and/or actualclinical use of mind-body methods. For example,77% percent of female physicians, compared with61% of their male counterparts, believe that theaddition of mind-body methods would lead to sig-nicant improvements in treatment outcomes.Among those who report using such methods toaddress their own health issues, 78% say that inte-grating mind-body methods would lead to signi-cant improvements in treatment outcomes com-pared with 51% of those who do not personally usesuch methods. We note that female physicians arealso more likely to use such methods to managetheir own health (66%, compared with 50% ofmen). Among physicians who rate their formal training as \"not helpful,\" 55% state that the inclusion ofmind-body methods would lead to improved treat-ment outcomes, compared with 84% of physicianswho consider their training in these areas to havebeen \"very helpful.\" Interestingly, physicians whorate their training in the role of psychosocial factorsmore positively are also more likely (30%, com-pared with 16%) to express a strong interest inreceiving further training in mind-body methods. Discussion The present study sought to examine physician'attitudes toward the role of psychosocial factorsand mind-body methods in medicine. An additionalgoal was to identify factors that might account forphysicians' relative openness and willingness to in-tegrate a more biopsychosocial perspective into theway they view and ultimately practice medicine.Several themes emerged. In this sample, a majority of physicians seem to recognize the importance of psychosocial factorsand the potential value of incorporating mind-bodymethods in the treatment of a number of commonmedical conditions.

Downloaded from proaches such as psychological counseling and other \"mind-body\" therapies (eg, relaxation, med-itation, imagery) include insomnia, headache, andlow back pain. Despite this widespread recognition that psy- chosocial factors can often play a critical role inunderstanding the causes of as well as treating,certain health problems, it is important to point outthat there are a signicant number of physicianswho seem to be skeptical of the benet to be gainedfrom integrating psychosocial factors into medicaldiagnoses and treatment. Approximately 1 in 3physicians, for example, indicates that the use ofmind-body methods would result in either small orno improvement in clinical outcomes. It is difcult to determine the extent to which the attitude and practice patterns we identied aregeneralizable to the larger population of practicingphysicians in the United States. Although onlyspeculative, it is possible that our lower than antic-ipated response rate (27%) may have reflectedsome general lack of interest in or enthusiasm forthe topic among the sample of physicians we ini-tially contacted. Such an interpretation seems morelikely given our nding that respondents receivingno monetary incentive held somewhat more favor-able attitudes toward the role of psychosocial fac-tors than those who received an incentive. In otherwords, physicians receiving no incentive may havebeen biased in favor of the topic and hence willingto take part in the survey despite not being com-pensated. Although we cannot be certain, given thisresponse rate and pattern of responding, it is rea-sonable to think that physicians in the general pop-ulation may be less likely to recognize the impor-tance of psychosocial factors than the group ofphysicians who responded to our survey. One mustalso consider the possibility that members of theAMA (where we drew our physician sample from)may not be a representative group with respect toattitudes toward mind-body medicine. Despite the possibility that (for the reasons noted above), our study ndings may be painting asomewhat more favorable picture regarding physi-cian attitudes toward the role of mind-body factorsthan is actually the case, there was still considerableskepticism among respondents in our sample, andthis skepticism seems, at least in a number of in-stances, to be in conflict with the actual evidencebase. For example, a recent meta-analysis con-cluded that the adjunctive use of psychological in-terventions improves clinical outcomes such aspain, function, and quality of life in patients withrheumatoid arthritis. 16Similar data exist for osteo - arthritis indicating that psychosocial interventionsimprove treatment outcomes. 17,18However, in our sample, only 20% of physicians (and 12% of rheu-matologists) indicated that the inclusion of psycho-social methods would lead to signicant improve-ments in patients with arthritis. Similarly, although evidence from randomized controlled trials 19 -22points to the potential value of mind-body interventions in the management ofhypertension and cardiovascular disease, only a mi-nority (36%) of physicians feel that there would belarge value-added if such methods were used asadjunctive treatment for these conditions, althoughalmost one third believe there would be little ifany value-added by using such approaches.Among the cardiologists in our sample (N /H1100552), only 1 in 5 indicate that there would be largevalue-added if mind-body methods were in-cluded as part of the treatment for cardiovasculardisease or hypertension. With respect to future intentions regarding the integration of mind-body approaches, there alsoseems to be considerable variability. Less than aquarter of physicians express high interest in ob-taining further training in such methods, whereasapproximately one third indicate that they havelittle if any interest in receiving additional mind-body training. Again, this variability is reflected inthe fact that approximately one third of respon-dents are either not very or not at all committedto using mind-body approaches in their clinicalpractice, whereas approximately 1 in 5 are \"verycommitted.\" Our multivariate analyses identied several fac- tors that with physicians' attitudestoward mind-body medicine. First, women wereconsiderably more likely than men to be open tothe role of psychosocial factors. Second, physicianswho report using mind-body methods (eg, relax-ation, meditation, imagery) to manage their ownhealth are also more likely to feel that such meth-ods can be valuable as medical treatments. Physicians' perceptions of the quality of their formal medical training in mind-body methods andthe role of psychosocial factors also emerged as asignicant predictor of both attitude and practice.Those who report that the training and mentoringthey received was not very useful in these areas are http://www.jabfm.org Barriers to the Integration of Mind-Body Medicine 563 on 13 September 2023 by guest.

Downloaded from signicantly less open to the value of incorporating mind-body approaches in practice. In an effort to identify additional barriers, we asked physicians to indicate the extent to whichthey felt that various factors limited their interest methods,\" and the perception that\"psychosocial factors were beyond their capacity tocontrol or influence.\" These results, which lendempirical support to our previous focus group nd-ings, 15suggest that low self-efcacy (to compe - tently address psychosocial issues), perceptions thatsuch factors are frequently difcult to control orimpact, lack of knowledge of the evidence basesupporting the use of mind-body methods and therole of psychosocial factors in health, and the lackof time to adequately address such issues, are allserving as barriers to medicine's more fully inte-grating the biopsychosocial perspective. Policy Implications We believe our nding that physicians rate theirtraining in these areas as relatively poor providesstrong empirical support for the earlier mentionedInstitute of Medicine report, highlighting the needto continue strengthening medical school as well asresidency training in the areas of mind-body rela-tionships and the potential impact of psychosocialfactors on health. Such a conclusion is further sup-ported by our nding that the majority of physi-cians report that lack of expertise regarding the useof mind-body methods is a signicant limiting fac-tor in their use of such approaches, and that poortraining in these areas contributes greatly to theinfrequent use of mind-body approaches amongphysicians. To increase medicine's integration of the bio- psychosocial perspective and to promote appropri-ate use of/referral to mind-body therapies (eg, re-laxation, stress reduction) in clinical practice, ourndings suggest 2 other potentially useful strate-gies. First, it will be important to expose morephysicians and physicians-in-training 23to the com - plex interplay of biological, psychological and so-cial factors and their influence on human physiol-ogy and health. 24 -26This need for greater exposure to the evidence base is reflected in the fact that theview held by many physicians' that mind-bodymethods are not efcacious is actually contradicted by the evidence-base. 11,18It is reasonable to con - clude that this misperception occurs, at least inpart, because physicians are simply unaware of theexisting basic science, epidemiologic, and clinicalevidence linking mental-emotional factors (eg,stress) to physiologic function and health. Thiswould seem to be an area of continuing medicaleducation that is ripe for further development. 27 Second, a signicant predictor of both attitude toward the role of psychosocial factors in health,and the likelihood that physicians would actuallyadopt mind-body methods in clinical practice, wasthe use of such methods to care for their ownhealth. Therefore, as part of educating physiciansabout the potential clinical value of mind-bodymethods, it may be important to make the trainingin these areas experiential as well as didactic, pro- viding physicians with opportunities to actually ex-periment with (experience the value of) such meth-ods in the \"laboratory\" of their own lives as aprecursor to their introducing patients to them.This idea is supported by studies suggesting thatinterventions designed to change physician behav-ior seem most effective when they are not merelydidactic in nature but include both active partici-pation and direct experience. 14,28 Finally, 2 other ndings of potential policy sig- nicance are physicians' time and issues of reim-bursement. The majority of physicians in our sur-vey (more than 70%) reported that lack of time (toaddress psychosocial issues) greatly limited theirability to integrate such factors into their care ofpatients. This is consistent with other data suggest-ing that physicians frequently experience managedcare practices as negatively impacting the doctor-patient relationship. 29In our study, the vast major - ity (more than 85%) also indicated that inadequatereimbursement from health insurers representedanother signicant obstacle to the utilization ofmind-body methods. From a policy standpoint, these ndings suggest that our current health care delivery system may, inmany respects, be antithetical to the biopsychoso-cial model. Specically, the increasingly restrictedtime physicians are able to spend with patients maybe resulting in a medicine that is, at best, subopti-mal, precisely because it limits the extent to whichphysicians are actually able to adequately addressthe psychosocial domain of patients lives, either 564JABFM November-December 2006 Vol. 19 No. 6 http://www.jabfm.org on 13 September 2023 by guest.
