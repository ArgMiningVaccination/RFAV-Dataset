The term \"ocular TB\" describes an infection by the M. tuberculosis species that can affect any part of the eye (intraocular, superficial, or surrounding the eye), with or without systemic involvement. \"Secondary ocular TB\" is defined as ocular involvement as a result of seeding by hematogenous spread from a distant site or direct invasion by contiguous spread from adjacent structures, like the sinus or cranial cavity. EPIDEMIOLOGY General Information - TB is an airborne communicable disease that most commonly involves the lungs. - Nearly one-third of the world's population is latently infected with TB, and more than 9 million new cases are diagnosed each year, 95% in developing countries. - Ocular TB may not be associated with clinical evidence of pulmonary TB; up to 60% of patients with evidence of extrapulmonary TB may not have diagnosed pulmonary TB - Ocular TB may be an initial presentation of extrapulmonary dissemination of infection - Posterior uveitis is the most common presentation of intraocular TB. [http://www.aravind.org/downloads/aravindnewsaug07/3.pdf](http://www.aravind.org/downloads/aravindnewsaug07/3.pdf) Region-Specific Information (Asia) | | Country | | Prevalence of presumed ocular TB | | India | | 0.4-9.8% | | China | | 4.0% | | Japan | | 7.0% | | Thailand | | 2.2% | | Philippines | | 6.8% PATHOPHYSIOLOGY/DEFINITION Ocular involvement from TB can either occur as a primary active infection or a secondary infection from a distant site, usually through hematogenous spread. The conjunctiva, cornea, and sclera are sites of primary ocular involvement. Diagnosis Clinical manifestations of ocular TB vary, which poses a challenge for diagnosis. The definitive diagnosis of TB is established by isolation of M tuberculosis bacilli from ocular tissues. However, because this is difficult to achieve, the diagnosis of ocular TB is often presumed in the presence of suggestive ocular findings in combination with any of the following: - Systemic findings consistent with TB infection - Positive interferon gamma release assay - Positive tuberculin skin test in asymptomatic individuals In addition, clinical response to anti-TB treatment (ATT) further supports a presumed diagnosis of ocular TB. SIGNS/SYMPTOMS In general, blurred vision and light sensitivity are the most common symptoms and may be the only reported symptoms. Patients can also be asymptomatic or have other complaints, such as headache, flashes, floaters, or redness of the eye. - Anterior Uveitis ( [Figure 1](#figure1)) - Unilateral precipitates - Iris nodules may be present near pupillary border or on iris surface - Broad-based posterior synechiae - Hypopyon may be observed Often accompanied by vitritis - Posterior Uveitis - Unilateral or bilateral - Solitary tubercle - Miliary choroidal tubercles may mimic tumor) ( [Figure 3](#figure3)) - Usually complication of untreated tubercule - Lesions predominantly present in choroid and in a serpiginoid pattern and coalesce - Individual lesions heal centrally and show centrifugal spread in amoeboid fashion - Usually bilateral, noncontiguous to optic disc and associated with mild vitreous inflammation - 2 distinct patterns: - Multifocal, discrete choroidal lesions that are initially noncontiguous and later progress to form diffuse lesions with an active edge resembling serpiginous choroiditis - Solitary, diffuse plaque-like lesion with an amoeboid extension Retinal vasculitis: predominantly involving veins with perivascular cuffing with infiltrates; may Choroidal Tubercles ( [Figure 5](#figure5)) - Most recognized lesions in intraocular TB - Yellowish lesions with poorly defined borders and typically elevated centrally - Commonly situated in posterior pole - Solitary and few in number - Inflammatory cells and subretinal fluid may be present - Tubercles near or at macula present with diminished visual acuity (otherwise, may be asymptomatic) - Immune recovery uveitis (IRU) ( [Figure 6](#figure6)) - Can occur among patients with concurrent HIV and TB infection during antiretroviral therapy - Has also been reported among patients with HIV and concurrent TB, cytomegalovirus retinitis, and varicella zoster TB involvement of retina alone is uncommon - Retina is often involved in setting of choroidal TB as retinochoroiditis - Exudative retinal hemorrhagic uveitis is highly suggestive of tubercular etiology - Orbit - Orbital involvement occurs most commonly in children, although rare cases have been reported in adults - Findings include a draining sinus tract and/or radiographic evidence of bony destruction - Eyelid - Often presents as an eyelid abscess or chalazion-like mass - Spontaneous drainage of abscess can form draining sinus tract - May also become involved as an extension of infection from surrounding skin - Lacrimal gland - Can present as symptomatic dacryoadenitis - Presentation may be indistinguishable clinically from bacterial infection - Conjunctiva - May present as an ulcer, subconjunctival the number of organisms is scarce so acid-fast bacilli may not be observed - Keratoconjunctivitis - Infection of cornea presents with pain and photophobia - Examination may demonstrate corneal erosion with stromal infiltration - Local lymph nodes may be enlarged - Sclera ( [Figure 7](#figure7)) - Involvement of sclera from hematogenous spread - Diagnosis often based upon evidence of scleral inflammation in patient with active TB LABORATORY EVALUATION - Microbiological or histopathological evidence of M tuberculosis - Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) on direct smear or culture of MTB from ocular samples - Pros: gold standard, definitive - Cons: low sensitivity, delayed diagnosis due to slow-growing nature of bacteria - Tuberculin skin testing (TST) - Used to assess immunological evidence of MTB infection, latent or active - Pros: low cost and easy availability - Cons: two-step process, subjective, low sensitivity and specificity, potential false- positive in prior Bacilli Calmette-Guerin (BCG) Objective, single-visit blood test that quantifies IFN-gamma response of T cells after in vitro stimulation of patient lymphocytes by MTB antigen - Pros: more specific, not affected by prior BCG vaccination and atypical mycobacteria - Cons: not superior to TST in sensitivity, high cost, technical difficulty; does not distinguish between latent and active disease - Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Pros: powerful tool for rapidly detecting mycobacterial genome from small sample of ocular fluid; allows fast detection and quantifies pathogen load in sample, minimal risk of carryover and cross-contamination; can also be helpful in identifying drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium - Cons: can still lead to false-negatives from ocular fluid samples - Chest x-ray (CXR) - To evaluate patients with suspected intraocular TB, when lungs are primary site of TB infection - Fluorescein angiography (FA) - Used in the evaluation of retinal vascular leakage and active choroidal lesions Reveals moderate to low internal reflectivity of large tuberculomas Patients diagnosed with active TB should also be tested for HIV due to high incidence of co-infection. TREATMENT - Ocular TB is generally treated under the same guidelines for active pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB - Standard anti-TB treatment (ATT): 6 months of therapy based on WHO recommendations ( [Figure 8](#figure8)) - First 8 weeks: Pyrazinamide - Next 18 weeks: - Pulmonary TB patients exhibiting drug resistance are switched to an alternate regimen based on culture reports; the same can be done for progressive ocular inflammation if drug resistance is suspected. Alternatively, escalation of corticosteroids may be helpful in case of increased ocular inflammation in presumed ocular TB. - Currently, no randomized trials for optimizing therapeutic regimen of anti-TB treatment in intraocular TB - Corticosteroids (topical and/or oral) may be used to control inflammation and are tapered over 6-12 weeks. Patients may have worsening of inflammation after starting ATT due to a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction related to release of Mycobacterium antigens upon initiation of antimicrobial therapy. This reaction can be controlled with systemic steroid therapy.
