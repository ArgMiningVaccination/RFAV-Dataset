It's more than fixing what's wrong. It's about celebrating what's right and making sure you're on the path to a healthier, stronger you. Often patients find their way to our clinic with goals of minimizing medications. If a patient ends up on a medication and needs to take it more long-term, we want the patient to be savvy on what nutrient deficiencies to look out for while on that medication. Medications are formulated to help override or block a specific biochemical pathway in our body. Long-term use of certain medications can change the way our body absorbs, excretes or metabolizes certain nutrients. Here are a few commonly used medications, and the nutrient depletions to consider. Statins (HMG CoA Reductase Inhibitors) If you are currently taking a statin, your body might eventually be lacking in coenzyme Q-10 (CoQ-10). Statins work by inhibiting an enzyme needed to produce cholesterol. Sounds great, right? But, blocking this enzyme also blocks the body's ability to make CoQ10. Why might this be a big deal? CoQ10 is a required nutrient in the body's production of energy. Chronic fatigue, heart dysfunction and migraines are conditions linked to CoQ10 deficiency. I have yet to see research that taking CoQ10 alongside a statin would help decrease chances of muscle side effects that statins can be infamous for causing. But something I still encourage patients to supplement for the purpose of optimal nutritional status. Oral Contraceptives (Birth Control Pills) Long-term oral birth control use can cause depletions in Vitamin B6, B12, folic acid and magnesium. These nutrients are critical for heart health and mood, and play a role in hormone balancing. If you are on OCPs for longer than a few months, I recommend taking steps to ensure your diet is rich in these nutrients, or if needed, supplementing with a high-quality B-complex. Testing blood levels of these nutrients could also be beneficial. Metformin This drug is usually a first line therapy for patients with pre-diabetes/diabetes. Over time, metformin use can deplete the body of vitamin B-12. When you look at the research, 30% of people who take metformin chronically have reduced levels of serum B-12. Symptoms of B-12 deficiency can include fatigue, weakness, and if severe can cause tingling/pain in the feet. Pain and tingling in the extremities is also a common symptom of uncontrolled diabetes. Other risk factors for B12 deficiency include: older age, vegetarian diet, proton pump inhibitor use and chronic NSAID use. Serum B-12 is a blood test that can screen for B-12 deficiency, but also available is a functional test for B-12 status called serum methylmalonic acid. Loop and Thiazide Diuretics Many diuretics can cause your kidneys to excrete higher than normal levels of potassium, magnesium and thiamine. If you are taking a diuretic, focus on increasing potassium and magnesium rich foods in your diet. Food sources can include swiss chard, spinach, avocado, apricots, apples, pumpkin seeds and broccoli.
