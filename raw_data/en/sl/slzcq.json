During the 2023-24 academic year, the AOA's Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA) will accredit 40 colleges of osteopathic medicine offering instruction at 65 locations to more than 38,000 medical students. Following medical school, DOs complete internships, residencies and fellowships, which can last between 3-8 years and prepare them to practice a specialty of their choosing. Each year, fourth-year osteopathic medical students and DOs seeking graduate medical education placements participate in the NRMP Match to secure residency positions at training institutions across the country. Breaking records from all previous matches, the 2023 Match placed 7,132 osteopathic medical students and past DO graduates into residency positions in 37 specialties. Outside of the NRMP Match, additional DO candidates secured residencies through NRMP's SOAP, the San Francisco and Urology matches, and the Military Match, leading to a final total placement rate of 99.5% for DO seniors.
