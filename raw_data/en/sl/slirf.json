With the announcement of federal authorization of the pandemic H1N1 vaccine, Nova Scotia is set to begin its biggest immunization campaign yet, Dr. Robert Strang, the province's chief public health officer, announced today, Oct. 21. The federal authorization order for H1N1 vaccine means the government of Canada is satisfied the vaccine is safe and effective. Specifics of the Nova Scotia plan include: - H1N1 vaccine will be available for free to all Nova Scotians who want it; - People in high-risk groups for seasonal flu can get seasonal flu and H1N1 shots at the same time; - H1N1 vaccine will be available through community clinics, some doctor offices and workplace clinics; - Community clinics will begin across Nova Scotia within the next two weeks. \"I have every confidence that the H1N1 vaccine is safe and effective for Nova Scotians,\" said Dr. Strang. \"I urge all Nova Scotians to get the H1N1 vaccine. It is the best way to protect yourself and your community.\" Nova Scotia has ordered 1.4 million doses of the vaccine. The first shipment, 52,000 doses, arrived Oct. 19. The province will pay about $4.5 million for the vaccine. District health authorities are organizing community immunization clinics. Doctors will also have the option to offer the vaccine in their offices. Private nursing agencies can also get the vaccine for workplace clinics. H1N1 vaccine is also being provided to hospitals and long-term care facilities to immunize staff. Each district health authority will organize its immunization program, including clinic dates and times. Nova Scotians should check with local district health authorities for dates and times. \"Every Nova Scotian who wants the H1N1 vaccine will be able to receive it,\" Dr. Strang said. \"Our priority is to ensure that all Nova Scotians have the opportunity to receive the vaccine in a timely manner.\" If Nova Scotians have questions about the vaccination, they can go to [www.gov.ns.ca/h1n1](http://www.gov.ns.ca/h1n1) , call their local public health unit or call HealthLink 811. Groups at high risk for seasonal flu can receive that vaccine at the same time. \"In the weeks past, we were recommending that only people above the age of 65 and those in long-term care facilities get the seasonal flu vaccine,\" said Dr. Strang. \"Our decision was based on the best information we had available to us at that time. \"New data indicates that we can offer the vaccines concurrently. In an effort to make it easier for Nova Scotians, both the H1N1 vaccine and seasonal flu vaccine will be offered at the mass immunization clinics.\" As in previous years, the seasonal flu vaccine will also be available through doctors' offices. We are now starting to see signs of H1N1 activity in Nova Scotia. There have been 17 cases of H1N1 in the province since Aug. 29. There has been one death in Nova Scotia associated with the virus. Dr. Strang continues to advise Nova Scotians to make every effort to minimize the spread of the virus. The most important step is to stay home if sick with flu-like symptoms, which are fever and/or cough with unusual tiredness, head/muscle/joint aches or sore throat. Along with immunization, people are also encouraged to take the following precautions to prevent illness: - Wash hands often with soap and water, especially after a sneeze or cough. When soap and water are not handy, alcohol-based hand sanitizers are an acceptable alternative. - Cough and sneeze into elbow or sleeve. - If using tissues, dispose of them appropriately and wash hands. - Limit touching eyes, nose and mouth. - Do not share drinking glasses, water bottles, mouth guards, cosmetics or eating utensils. - If concerned that medical advice or care is needed, contact HealthLink 811. Like any illness, should symptoms worsen, visit a doctor or walk-in clinic.
