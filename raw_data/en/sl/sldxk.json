In the , dark of a wild night a shiJ? strikes a rock and sinks, but one of\"i ts sailors clings desperately to a piece of wreckage and is eventually cast' up exhausted on an l.Ulknown and deserted beach. In the morning he ,struggles to his feet and, rubbing his salt-enc11Isted eyes, looks around to learn where he is. ,The only human thing he sees is a gallows. \"Thank God,\" he exclaims, 'llcivilization.lI There cannot be many of us \"'lho have not heard this story or~ when we-first heard it~ laughed at it. The . sailor's reaction was, we think, absurd. Yet, however old the story, the fact is that the gallOi'ls has not even yet been abOlished among us;, and , ... e count ouxs;E?lves among the civilized peoples of the world. \" , Moreover, the attempt to have it abolished by the Supreme Court may only . have succeeded in strengthening its structure . I do 'not ,knOi'l whether the intellectual ''lorld l'laS surprised when\" only two days prior to the nation's two hundredth birthday, the Supreme Court held that capital punislli~ent is not, under all circumstances, a violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. I do know, or at least have very good reason to believe,' that the Court's decision came as a bitter blow, not only to the hundreds of persons on death rOi'l who now faced the v,ery real prospect of being executed\" but to the equally large number of persons \\'1h9 had devoted their time, talent\" and, in some cases, their professional careers to the cause of abolishing this penalty . had been making progress toward this end. Only four years earlier, the Court had held that the manner in' ,.,rhich death sentenc~s ,.,rere ',~'~being\" imposed by judges capriciously\";'\" ;.:~~ cori~.tituted cruel and unusual puni'shrnent, and this decision seemed to be an inevitable step along the path described by still ea;iier d~~isions, a path that would lead ultimately, and sooner rather than later, to the goal 'of complete and final abolit~,~m. T:rue,' they were four dissenters ,in the 1972 cases; and Justice Douglas, one o:Ethe five justices in the majority, had since retired; but the abolitionists had reason to hope that some of the 1972 qissenters l'lOuld reconsider their positions. The Chief Justice, for example, had indicated his sympathy for the abolition cause, saying that if he were a legislator making a pOlitical judgment, \" rather than a judge making a 'constitutional judgment, he ''lould either\" vote to abolish the penalty altogether or-rest-rict its 'use \"to a small category of the mo.st heinous crimes.\"* And in a poignant opinion, Justice , Blackman had spoken of the \"excruciating agony\" of having to vot,e to uphold death sentences. and of the depth of his abhorrence of ~he penalty ~ \"with all its aspects of physical distress and \"fear ahd of moral judgment exercised by finite minds. \"** Perhaps he coul.d be prevailed upon to set \" aside his constitutional scruples; after all, ohe year later he had written' the Court r s opinion invalidating 'the abortion 1 al'lS, *** and that opinion was at least as bold in its disregard of constitutional scruples as anything the abolitionists l'lere asking of him. * Furman v,. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, .375 (1972). 'Dissenting opirtion. *** Roev. Wade, .410 U.S. 113 (1973). '~ , '.' .,. .' .-3-,. Besides, judges are not immune to popular opinion or able to isolate 'themselves completely from the trend of the times~ and the trend \\'l'aS clea,rly in the direction of abolition. Juries se~med increasingly umli],).irtg to impose the sentence of death, and this was true in other countri~~s as Vlell as\u00b7 in America. Whatever the case in the Soviet Union and Saudi Arabia, or other such barbarous places, civilized co~ntries \\;~re abolishing the penalty, l'lhether in practice, as in France, or by statute, .-\u00b7as in Eiritain. Only a month or so before the Supreme Court held it to be . . not unconstitutional~ the C~nadi?-n House of Commons. had voted to .abolish it for all crimes, thus bringing to a successful conclusion a campaign that had engaged thepassions of many of that country's most dedicated intellectuals. Rather than to doubt the 9utcome, abolitionists had cause to wonder why it had taken- and in America \\'las taking-so long. U must have see~~d to them that decent and th0t;tghtful and j\\.rthur Koestler- and the public had long since demonstrated its opposition to punishments' considered by them to be less barbarous than the death penalty.. This generation of Americans, unlike their forbears would not support the branding of convi cted criminals J or. \"ear-cropping. \" Pub lie opinion \\'1as, as the Court had said as early as 1915, becoming more enlightened on these matters, and the cause o\u00a3this enlightenment \\'1as a grmving appre.ciation of \"a humane justice.\"* This grmving enlightenment had constitutional significance because the meaning of \"cruel ,and unusual\" varies \\'1i th the times. .~ the Warren Court said in 1958, this Eighth Amendment term derives '* Weems v. 'United States, 217 U.S. .~' u., . . -4- of dec~ncy that mark the progress \"\\ ,<\",~f a maturing society. \"* , good .. '.-;~:~ e' .' .< e an:11LcertainlY good reason to hope,. that by 1976 society would have matured :;l~ stil1 further and that the Court \\'lOuld acknowledge this officially by declaring the death penalty to be Itcruel and unusualll according to the standards then governing. It was this hope that was cruelly dashed by the decision in Greggv. Georgia, the leading 1976 case.** Perhaps the .Court began to doubt its premise that a \"maturing )~ society\" is an ever more gentle society; the evidence on this is surely not reassuring. The steady moderating of the c~iminal law has not be~n accompanied by a parallel moderating of the ,'laYs of criminals or bya steadily evolving decency in ,the conditions ll.Tlder which men around the l'lorld must live their lives.

As I shall show, our criminal 'justice institutions impose punishment only as a last resort and with the greatest reluctance, as if they \\'lere embarrassed or ashamed, a~d they avoid executing even our Charles, Mansons. It \",ould appear ,that Albert' Camus l'laS rig~t when he said that Hour civilization has lost the pnly valu~s'that, in a certain \\'lay, can justify [the death] penalty.\"* What is beyond doubt is that our intellectuals are of thi~ opinion. The idea that the presence Df a gallows could indicate the presence of a civilized people is, as I indicated at the out.set, a joke. I certainly thought so the first time I heard the story; it \\vas on,ly a few years ago that 1. began to suspect that that sailor may have been right. What led me to change ;my mind ''las the phenomenon of Simon Wiesenthal. Like most Americans, my bu~iness did not require me to think , ,about criminals or, more precisely, the puni~.hm~nt of criminals. In a vague \\~ay, I , .. as a\\\\Tare that there was some disagreement concerning the purpose of punishment -.deterrence, rehabilitation, or retribution- but I had no reason to decide ''lhich lvas ,right or to l'lhat extent they may all have been right. :: I did knO\\o1 that retribution 'vas held in ill-repute among . .. criminologists. Then, as 1 said, I began to reflect oir' the work of S:i,<mon WiesentI:al who, from that tiny, one-man office,in Vienna, has devoted himself since 1945 exclusively to 'the\u00b7task.of hunting down the Nazis who sunrived the War and escaped into the world.

He says his conscience forces , him \"to b!'ing the guilty ones to trial. \"* And if they are convicted, then 1'\"= \\.;hat? Punish them~ of 'course. But \\-.rhy? To rehabilitate them, to incapaCitate them, to deter others from doing what they did? ,The answero..- to me and, Isuspect,everyoneelse who agrees 'that they should be punished was clear: to pay.them back. And how do you pay back ObersturmfUhrer kno'vs, Eichmann 'lias executed, and I suspect that most of the decent, civilized Norld agrees' tha't this was the only way he, could be paid back.

The Biblical Argument The first man and woman violated God's commandment and were banished from paradise. Their first-born son killed his brother, and God made hima. fug~tive and a \\'Janderer upon the earth .. forbidding the soil to yield up its fruits to him, and put a mark on him, \"lest any finding him should kill him.1I Vengeance, said the Lord, is mine, and if anyone kills Cain, it shall be taken on him sevenfold. \"And Cain \\'lent out from the presen~e of the Lord .and d\\<lelt in the land of Nod .. on the east of Eden.\" Both homicide and its punishment are almost as old as history, and the disagreement over 1'lho'sha11 impose the punishment, and what that punishment ~hould be ......:death or banishment- fOllowed immediately upon the fi:!::st homicide. jhen AdamIs wife bore him another son, Seth, to replace Abel slain by Cain, and the generatio~s of Seth multiplied on the face of the' earth. With . them .. however, \\'lent \\'lickedness, making the eaTth corrupt in God's sight, until He resolved to destroy it, putting an end to all flesh. But Noah was a -righteous man, \"perfect in his generations,\" and God spared him and his family .. and gave him dominion over every living creature, and made a covenant with him, .. promising never again to destroy the earth \\vi t~ a' flood but, in exchange, re\u00ad . qJ.~!.::ing a reckoning of him. \"Of every man I s brother will I require the-:'life .6f-:InCl;x~\u00b7/! +~:njt .~I\\~hC'so sheddeth man! s blood, by man blood be shed; \" .,,' ',' for . . in the image of (i~d ma:Ueh~Jn.~~t), t~ 'it would se,em, then, that in the eyes of God murder is one of the \\'IOT-St of~,'rfP\\~~nseso~eaus;~'tQ Rill a Xr*an is to . .. .1 e, .' ,', / 2 0' (j the flood, a.nd~ in tilCle, to His favored nation o~od gave ,:the law, and with it, again, the ,specific prohibition of murder: 1ClJ.'hou shalt not kill.\" God gave men the law, but, in fashioning them in His olln irlage, He also mede them aimre of themselves and of their interests, and endow:ed them with reason. whereby they might know' good a.'1d evil, and with passions--anger, for e;xample, and envy--and thereby made it both possible and likely that they wO:U;ld brea.~, i? the In5... Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that He endowed them' with these qu~lities and therefore fo~d it necessa~J to give them the law to guid~ and restrain them. But men have never ceased to kill their own k:ind. ';['hey .. have killed in war, they have killed in anger or out of envy for gain and they have enacted their own l~ws authorizing them to kill those vho violate the laws of God or what they understand to be the lal';s of' God.

Of course, the Biblical texts leave, some. doubt as to this,. to s9{t;rthe least. The question is whether in giving the law to Moses and the Jewish-nation, (:) Glod also gave them the authority to punish infractions of the Ia1.. God (!ommands us not to kill, but the context suggests that this com:mandment, like tne others forbidding theft,\u00b7 and adultery, :for example, falSIe testimony, isaddre~5ed individual :person rathel'\\~~~; t~ the legal ~ommunity. was' addressing the legal community, or would appear to have been doi~g so, 'Q God. vhen He said (Leviticus24:17),\"And he that kilieth 3Ily man shall surelly be, put to death, life of a murderer, which is guilty of , ,',.

The other passages are more troublesome for the opponents of capitalpunishm~nt, which may explain \\vhy one of them shifts the ,.\" ,.'t' argument from what the Bible. says to what Judaism or Jewish law said.

But the argument is ma.de that Je\\dsh IaN p~aced so many rest-.rj.ctions on the trial of capital cases that. it became \"virtually impossible to enforce the death penalty.\"** But virtually impossible is not absolutely impossible. The state of Israel does not authorize capita.1 punishment except- and the law was\u00b7 adopted l'lith the consent of the rj3:~igious parties -for the likes of Eichmann. Some Christian writers point to Jesus' declaration that He had not come to abolish the 1m'/' but to fulfill it (Matthew 5:17), and in5ist that He amplified His 11leaning lvhen, in verses 21-2\" He added that H\\.;hoever kills shall .j\"' be liable to judgment.\" This, they say, includes the jU9-gment of capital punishment. But the text does not say this. Besides, as opponents of the death penalty say, Christians should forgo quoting \"this or that verse,\" and I> -Book XIV (!lie Books of pp. 150-15,1, 163. Israel J ..

In fact~ the first avowed a~d forthright argument against:, the death penal ty was written by a man who was horrified by the legal practices of Christia.'1 nations . Opposition to capital punishment was born out of liberalism, and liberalism vas born in the seventeenth century in reaction to the politics of nominally Christian Europe and, ,especially, no~nally Christian Britain.

Within a :few years he himself was to sut~fer horribly for his . false testimony Since his oTfense was not a felony in the eyes of the law but only a misdemea.~or, Oates could not be sentenced to death; instead\" he was pilloried, whipped fro~ Aldgate to l:leW'gate, then, after a two-day interval, ,.,hipped times, according to someone who dyuuted--from HeW'gate to 'lYburn.

The Natural Public Law Argument The campaign to abolish the death penalty was begun only in 1764 by Cesare Beccaria in one chapter of his unusually influential book, On .\u00b7Crimes and Punishments, and with its publication, Beccaria achieved instant fame, being hailed, throughout Europe, invit~d to Paris by the' Abb[ Morel let and praised by Voltaire as the :i;irst manto apply the, principles of the new physical and moral sciences-the principles of the Enlightenment- to e crime and its treatment. * Macaulay, Ope cit., vol. 5, eh. 15. e. i1: ';. -9- His re\u00a3~;rms req~tred much more than a revision of\u00b7 a criminal code; they , ' .required a neiv order of. state, a state founded on new principles and a state from Hhich the church's influence would be excluded. There are three classes of virtue and vice according to Beccaria,' the religious, lvhich are derived from a revelation; the natural, which are derived from natural law;. and the political, . or conventional, which are derived Ilfrom the expressed or tacit compacts bf men. 11* They need not be in contradiction, he says\" but \\'Ihat. is derived from one' need . not be derived from another; and, more to the point he is about to make, what isertjoined by one is not necessarily enjoined by the others. His point is that the'la\\![ should enjoin only \\'ihat is derived from the third, \"the expressed ~{ or tacit compacts of men, II and he thinks that enlightened men l,dll not make a tacit compact ratifying all the la\\'1s of: Hoses, for example. He makes an effort ,. to conceal the implications of this, and thereby to avoid proscription by the ~, Church, by disingenuously declaring that since he is going to speak only of the -\" '. third class of virtues and vices, he cannot be said to adopt principles , \"contrary either to natural la\\'l or revelation\";** but, of course, the Church \\'las not deceived, and would have been unusually obtuse to have been deceived. In a later chapter Beccaria says the Im![s, and only the laws, form \"the basis of human morality.\"*** Wise governments do not punish \"wholly imaginary crimes,H but neither do th~y tolerate tlfan41tical sermons\" disturb the public \\\\ ty. tvise'\\.governments aJ!!ow citizens to db anything \"that is not contrary to the laws, \\\u00b7iithout having to fear any other inconvenience than that \\vhich may res,ult from the action itself\"; the laws of a just state will be built on self-interest, the ~ ...

Bather than to relJt on Biblicill exegesis, Beccaria would abolish capital punis1unent by bllilding a political order that does not recognize the relevance of the Bible and, not to speak IJeriphrastically,. derives from principies that a.re inconpatible with the Bible.

Utopia isa dialogue and, like those of Plato f s on which it is modelled, it is made up of speeches by characters and in specific settings. The arglli~ent against the death penalty is :'-advanced in Book I by the ch~acter, Raphael, to &'1 English la.-,.;yer and in the presence of a cardinal of the churcn, the Archbisnop of Canterbury. Without at all entering into I\"rore' s meaning~ it is enough to say that. Raphael, a few pages later in Book I, praises the penal laws he observed in the country of the \"Polyerits, II and these laws imposed the death penalty for various crimes. In Book II, Raphael describes the la~fs and the l1wise and good consti tutionH of the Utopians, among whont, he says, he lived for five years. Those laws prescribe, e.g., that those -who are guilty of adultery and, having been pardoned by the Prince, relapse, lIare punished with death.\" Nore's teachi.ng cannot be l.mderstoofi from these speeches alone, but if Ancel refers to one speech, he is obliged to take account of the speeches that contradict that one \" .; ------- ------ Ie -15 -, , , ,'\" all his ,judicial predecessol's tOBether, it ins~ired and used the meo.nest .\" and ugliest of', the passions. liDost thou believe trDost thou believe in hell i'ire?

Unable to prove.c.that imprisonll1ent is' a.-.,sui\",ficient deterrent--he 'was writing long before the time '. . of empirical social. science--he points to countries where, for a time, the death penalty wa.s not imposed, and he was satisfied that the murder rate had not increased there. In this fashion, Beccaria originated the most frequently- used argument against the death penalty, namely, that it is unnecessa.r\"J. He did not begin with it--he began with the argum6nt that civil society was not author:ized to take human life;:--out he used it to buttress his (~'-) . '. .' . case. In itself the argument not .compell~\\ng-=;,&, pract~ce th the argui11ent concerning the illegality of the death penalty., it acquir~s considerable :force.

( '! death is the only penalty sufficient to deter heinous crimes, especially IIi~Jider. If this can be shown not to be true, the case against abolition \\-rould seem , \\r-'.! to have'been destroyed. The abolitionists have devoted a good deal of energy to the task of demonstrating that the death penalty is u:necessar,f, that, when weighed \u00b7..rith the possible alternatives--for example, li:fe imprisonment--it has no di:f.ferential effect as a deterrent. Most students of the question have been persuaded by social science studies that \"the ine:ffectiveness of the death penalty as a deterrent to , * murder has been'demonstrated convincingly.\" The point is made that the rate \" '. 01 homicides varies :from place to place ,and from time to time, but that the imposition of the death penalty rather tha..J. a long-term prison sentence is not a .factor in these variations, or, ata minimum, has not been ShovTU to be a factor. To this the abolitionists have testified in hearing after hearing, trial after trial, a~d investigation after inve9tigation. Iri what is surely the most influential study of deterrence, a study cited favor;=.bly by a number of govern.t:lental commissions, here and abroad, ~1iorsten Sellin. compares the homicide rates in contiguous states, some ,.;1 th and some wi thaut the death pena.J.ty, and finds no significant differences among them in the number of' bomicid~per 100,000 population. He then examines the murder ~ate within * Hillia.1l Bailey, \"Murder and the Death Penalty,\" The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminolc,gy,. vol. 65 (September, 1974), p. 416.

He concludes that \"the death ,penalty, as ,\u00b7re use it, 7:\u00adexercises nb influence on the extent or fluctuating rates of\" capital crimes. It Other soci8~ scientists have found similar results. T4ey have tested tIle retentionists I proposition that the death penalty is a superior deterrent' . to life imprisonment for criminal homicide, and, even if it cannot be said that the proposition has been disproved, it can be said that it has not been confirmed; in fact, one authority insists that i'G has been \"disconfirmed\" by. the uniformity or consistency of the findings published. 'l'his is suff'icient to st~port their case for abolition: to deter criminal homicide it is not necessar.1 to resort to this a..l1cient a.Tld barbaric practice. rf~vertheless it bears repeating that ho'.;ever r:mch the J:1odern debate on capital punishr:tent has ~ focussed on the deterrence issue, the abolitionists do not rest their case on their findings that show it has no differential deterrence capaci t7.

The Constitutional Argument We Americans have debated the morality and neces'sity of the death penalty throughout almost the entire period of our experience as a nation, and, until 1976 when the Supreme Court ruled in favor of its constitutionality,** it had been debat,ed among us in constitutional terms, \\'lhich is TIot true elsewhere. The Eighth Amendment clearly and expressly forbids the imposition of IIcruel and unusual punishments, II a prohibition that applies TImV' to the states as . well as to the national government, and, it was argued, the death penalty lV'as such a punishment. It is, of course, incontestable that the death penalty was not regarded as crpel and unusual by the men \\I/ho \\..zrote and ratified the Amendment. They may have forbidden cruel and unusual punishments but they acknO\\V'ledged the 1egiti- , maey of capital punishment when, in the Fifth Amendment, they provided that no person \"shall be held for a capitai . crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury,\" and when in the same amendment they provided that no one shall, for the same offense, \"be t\\vice put in jeopardy'o\u00a3 life or limb,\" and when, in the Fifth as well as in the Fourteenth Amendment, they forbade, not the taking of life, but the taking of life Ilh'ithout due process of law.\" We also knO\\v that the same Congress which px:oposed the Eighth Amendment also provided for the death penalty in the first Crimes Act.*** Even .;' ',~ *Victor Gollancz, Capital Punishment: The Heart the Matter (LondoI,1: Victor Go11ancz, 1955), p. 7.

So the death penalty can be held to be ,cruel and ~'1usual in the constitutional sense only if it has somehow become so in the pa,ssage of time. Until recently the Supreme Court had invalidated punishments ~'1der this clause only on the ground of inappropriateness: in 1910, the Court held \\ it to be inappropriate and therefore cruel to sentence a ma.'.l convicted c:f fraudulent practices to fifteen years imprisonment at hard labor 'and to be chained, 'wrist to ankle, a:~ing twelve years of' this sentence, and \";0' be ' ..... * pernanently deprived of some .of his civil rights .. ,., In a sense, this means that the Eighth ltrnendment requires the punishment to fit the crime. But., this is not the,only respect in 1fhich a pu.rlishment may be cruel a...'1d unusual: some punishments are intrinsically so, irrespective .of the crimes :for which t~ey are inflicted, fu'1d would hav~ been so regarded by the authors of the Amendment.

Is it not relevant that the American people have insisted that executions be .. carried out by more h~~ane methods and that they not be carried out in public a~d that the penalty be imposed Tor fewer and fewer crimes, and that juries have shown a tendency to refuse to convict \u00b7for capital crimes? In these ways the people are merely demonstrating what has been true for centuries, namely, that, when given the opportunity to act, the average ma.\"l (as opposed to judges . ** '. and vindictive politicians ) wi~l refuse to be a. party to legal murder One of the :l:'amiliar fcrcts about English juries during the period when the death sentence was mandator'J for scores of felonies \\fas their tendency to go to great lengths to avoid having to ,convict for a capital crime. If, \"- for example, it was a capital crime to steal property valued at 40 or more shillings, m~\"lY a jury solemnly and shamelessly set a value of 39 shillings on property worth much more. TOe willingness to accept a defense of insanity is merely one of the ways modern juries accomplish the same end. Perhaps the !p.ost interesting illustration of this uneasiness in the face' of the death penalty is the ancient privilege of benefit of clergy. This privilege.had a history in England that extended from the earliest time for which we have recor(is up to the year 1827, when it was finally abolished by Act of Parliament * Arthur J. Goldberg and Alan N.\u00b7 Dershowitz, \"D~claring the Death Penalty Unconstitutional, 11 Harvard Law Review, vol. 83 ('June 1970), pp. 1787-8. ** Koestler, \" . . At the time it originat.ed all felonies excep\u00b7t petty larc;eny and mo.yherrt. carried the death penalty at cornmon law, but clerics in ora.~rs c~)Uld be tried oilly in ecclesiastical courts which were not authorized to impo~e the death penalty for MY of'fense.

The fact of the matter, or so it is alleged, is that .A:nerican;)juries have show\"Il an increasing tendency to avoid imposing the death penal.ty except on a certain class of o.ffender, who are distinguisbed not by their criminality but by their race or class. Justice Douglas emphasized this in his opinion .... . in the 1972 capital punish:rr!ent cases. \"One searches 01U' chronicles in vain for the execution of any meobers of the affluent strata of this society, If lu~ saiu. \"T'ne Leopolds and Loebs are given priscln terms, not sentenced to death. tI** The facts in those cases seem to bear him out.

A struggle ensued which she lost. Holding the scissors to her throat, Jackson then raped her. ,Georgia law a't t~is time, ~1:968, permitted the jur-j' to choose between the c1eath penalty, life imprisoml!ent or \"imprisonment and labor in the penitentiary for not less than one year nor more than 20. years. II Tne jury chose death.

Texas la\" provided that a l' perSOn convicted ~of rape should be puniLphed 'by death or life imprisonment or imprisonment \"for any terrI). o:f years not less tha..'1. five. II Once again, t:he jury chose to iEPose the death penalty. Such are the facts in these three cases that reached the Sllpreme Court in 1972. In the light of the sentences imposed, however, the salient facts were these: all three offenders were black and all three 'victims ,{ere white. Death sentences ar~ imposed not out of a hatred of the crimes co~Idtted, it is said, but out of a hatred of blacks. Of the 3859 persons executed in the United St.ates in the period 1930-1967,; * 2066, or 54 percent were black. Nore than half of the prisoners now under . sentence of death are black. In short, the death penalty, W'e have been told, \"may have servedll to keep especially blac,ks !tin a position of! ~~lbjugation * , Sourceoook of Criminal Justice Statistics -1974, itself is unconsti tu\u00b7tiona'l. \" ~. f 6.

The movenent to abolish capital p1l.l1iE:!hment in .An.erica and to reform. the law of' punishment was initiated by Dr. Benjamin Rush in Philadelphia in 1787 in a paper delivered in the house of Benjamin Franklin. Tne reform movement could have begu..'1 un.der more auspicious circtLlJlstances, or perhaps it i'rouldbe more accurate to say, under more favorable ampices) only if it , , could have attracted the active support of the leading Founders; but these sober men held themselves aloof,' perhaps because they thought the constitutional ~ provisions met the case. Still, Rush himself was a signer of the Declaration of Independence, Philadelphia was the city in which the Constitution was 'tJritten, 1787 was the year in which it was written, and it would be supere;rogatory \\\\ to detail Franklin f s various contributions to the nation's founding.

The colony's :first constitution, Penn's \"Great Act\" of 1682, had effected a significant reform of the criminal lair by abolishing the death penalty for all crimes excep t premeditated murder, and it was only at the insistance of the Crown that, on the occasion of' Penn I s death in 1718, the II intoler2$t an.a sanguinary system law 'Was reimpos ed on the colony. Pennsyl va'\u00b7lia restored. the reform in 1794, after independence, and in the spirit of Penn began the task of reforming the whole of the criminal la\";/'. Rush's first call for abolition of the death penalty was part of !IAn Enquiry into the Effects Of Public Plli'\"lishments Upon Criminals 8...11d Upon Society.lI In this paper, and even more markedly in his 1794 paper devoted ...... , solely to capital p~l1ishment, Rush showed the influence of Beccaria.

II , \\1ith this, the :rcform ,; movement ~ook on. a cha'racter that marks it to this day. . , The penitentia.ry vas seen as an alternative-to the punishments imposed. ;~t in Bri tain--death and banishment--as well as to the P.mer~can pr~ctice of \\'. inflicting publicpunishuents in the form of the whipping post, the pillory:> the stocks and what Rush saw as degrading public labor. (His particular target was the so-called \"vheelbarrow la.',,\" l.hiQh required persons convicted of felonies to perform 'ifork on the s Greets of Philadelphia.) For reasons to be eA~lained shortly, Rush saw the primary purpose of punishment to be reform of the criminal and, quite obviously, the penalty or death \"tTaS least calculated to achieve this. For someivhat similar reasons, he rejected banish- ment; not only was ~t \"next in degree1 in folly and in cruelty, to the punish- ment of death,\" but it deprived society or the advantages that derive :from a . man 1 s love of' kindred a..'1d COll..'1tr'J, to Rush a natural passion that could. be rekindled in' the he'art of' every criminal. And public pll..'1isbmepj.,: he said, '~. \"t, is calculated to have a deleterious ei'fect not only on those vho suffer it but on those ,\u00b7rho . observe it . H RefolT.l of the criminal ca..'1not be achieved by subjecting him to public display a..'ld disgrace.. The inf'amy attached to it destroys his sense of' shame and his reputaiion~ and having lost these~ he has nothing left to lose in society; the likely e:ff'ect is to harden his criminal propensities and to instill in hin a desire to revenge himself' on the society whose laws subjected him to ,,~ this treatment. Besides, being usually of short duration , a public punishment produces no changes in body or mind of' the sort 'needed tore.forlll the habits of vice. It is said that public punishment, by striking terror in the hearts of those who observe it, deters them from committing crimes. Not so, says Rush u . t 1. I ! L_ f'. ) ,.. '\" In the first place, it fosters' fortitude i?~ the criminal (and this is said ! to be especiallY true in the case of public executions*), wh'o is then admired .-)\", by the g,oes withoutt saying- for Rush, a't least- that criminals should not be admired. But this is only part of the story. The sight of the criminal's suffering is calculated to pr?voke sympathy for \" him; b:rt; forbidden by the law (and their good character which has been developed by the law) to sYmpathize \\vi th criminals, this sympathy is Hrendered ~bortive,\" insofar as it is deprived of an object to \\\u00b7ihich it ~ , can attach itself. The effect of this-or ~ Rush maintains -~ is positively harmful to society. \"The principle of sympathy after being often opposed by the law of the state, which forbids it to relieve the distress it , . commiserates, will cease to act altogether; and from this defect of action, and the habit aJ.-ising out of it, will soon lose its place in the human breast.\" People will then come to view ''lith indifference .... . .. prisoners-\u00ad i'fU1d '-what is worse all, of' our moral f'aculty is ': :J removed, there is nothing to guard the mind from the inroads ,of' every positive ** vice.1f T'nis natural sensibility, or natural mox'al sense, must be kindled and cherished; i'rom it comes the Obligation to love lithe lrhole human race\"; but the * See, e.g., Bernard Ma.\"\"ldeville, J..n Enquiry into, the Causes of' the Freouent Executions Tyburn (London: 1725). illandevillesuggested that much of the intrepidity displayed on the gallows was due to the liquor consumed by the condemned.

The Auburn system adopted the principle of isolation but modified it by requiring \"- the prisoners to leave their solitary cells during the day in order to perform 'j : useful labor in the common workshops, b,ut it obliged them to observe a rule of absolute silence during the period outside the cells. The prisoners would continue to reflect (and repent) in their isolation from one another, and the silence rule, enforced by the whip, would p:;-event their niutual criminalization, while the work in common would spare them the worst consequences of absolute , . isolation: severe depression, demoralization w,d, indeed, insanity.

One man--tra very dexterous thi~f\"--declared that he blessed the day he had. been confined and that he 'i;ould never \"commit another robbeT\"J as long as he liyed!!; but hi~ manner led Dickens to call this \"unmitigated hypocrisy.\" As Beaumont anp. Tocqueville had observed ten years earlier, the convict \"has an interest in showing to the chaplain profound repentence tor his crime, and a lively desire to return to virtue,\" which is a phenomenon * Ibid., l?~, 288. ** Dickens's account is said to be, in part, a product or\" his \"fertile imagin- ation,\" and \"Was immediately challenged by friends of the system.

(The administrative lesson \u00b7to be drawn from t]1is is that the evaluation of a reform program cannot be left in the hands of its friends, or in the hands. of those hired by its friends.) Perhaps it was not inevitable that the \"house of repentancell become the sort of institution it is today-that the Auburn of the early nineteenth century New York become the Attica of the twentiet~ ... -but it was hot reasonable to think that the typical prisoner could be led, by any sY!?J;~m, to become a genuine : \"./ co.' penitent. Some surely, but to build a system'fo.r the many that is contrived , to benefit only the fe\\'i is politically irresponsible. That ''ias the conclusion dra,m by Beaumont and Tocquevil~e: \"an institution is only political if it is founded on the interest of the mass; it loses its character if it oniy pro~~ts a small number. 11** And the penitentiary system ted -and still profl ts- only a small number. There are those l~ho insist it profits nobody. Benjamin Rush began with the scientist's confidence that every problem has its solution and every disease its cure. He said just that.. Since crime was a disease, it remained only to find the \"remedy. or reme<iies\" appropriate to each of its manifestations; this inevitably meant a search fo~the\u00b7treatment appropriate to each criminal. Hence, \"let no notice be taken, in the law, of the punishment that awaits any particular crime.fI To the contrary, punishments\u00b7 should al\\'iays be varied in degree \"according to ,the temper of ~riminals, * Beaumont and Tocqueville, On the PenitentiaryS}~ste11i in America, p. 89. ** Ibid o , \" ; -20 - . ,,* or the progress of their reformatl.on. In -the event, it was not Rush's .\" treatment tha:t:. .W'as established in the penitentiaries. Criminals were locke(l in solitary cells, made to work, importuned. to re]?ent, and at the outset, at '\" least, there ,{as a genuine attempt to classifY them at:!corcling to their crines, to the end of providing them with individualized treatment. But the administra- ti ve problems .and costs of such a program were immense. A system or discrete treatments \"Tould have to ,-Tai t upon the development or psychiatry (and beyond tha-b) and the growth of the economy that is expected to pay for them. In the I circUmstances of the nineteenth century, the only variation in \"treatment\" was in' the length of time presumed to be requi/:t'ed to cause prisoners to repent, and in the course of' time the penitentiaries ceased altogether to spea..'Jt of repentance. As early as the 1850's official commissions began to report the f'ailure of the penitenttary system. Its' object was to make the prisoner a better member \"\"\"\"\" of society, but this it did not succeed in doing, and var;! early it ceased to trJ. E.C. WInes and Tlieodore }P,.;ight reported to the New York legislature in 1867 . that there was not a state prison in the entire coUntry that\\:made the reformation '''\"* of convicts the one supreme object of its discipline.\" To say nothing of other reasons' 'for this f'ailure, the typical convict was functionall~{ i11i terate and theref'ore unable to read the Bible with which he was provided.

II The difficulty ;\"as greater than he and~ more to the point, the penitentia~J officials, imagined. To speak. strictly, penitence requires. one ,to acknowledge histransgressiort) and to ruonifest the desire to be cleansed of it, as well as the willingness tJ to pa.y the price required. It is /\"iiimilar to expiation insofar as the cleansing <\"';-or the remission :of the sin depends on \\\"ithhold His punishment, although expiation is the older phenomenon and is usually associated i'li th more wra.~~ful gods, gods ,.,ho '>'-,\\ -. d~martd payment ratherthan pe'rmit it. It is likely that such a gDd \\'Jill be ~\u00b7,:~~t; ,', appea'~ed only by a severe punishment iinflicted on the guilt! perspn or a member J, \".;\" :';,~t; of his family. Thug, according to Homer, when Agamemnon kiiled the stag ,> sacred to Artemis, she responded by spreading a pestilence among the Greek army and calming the i.,rinds, thereby keeping the Greek fleet in port; and she was appea~ed only by Agamemnon's agreement to sacrifice his daughter, Iphigenia. \u00b7And in a somewhat different example we read in Numbers XXXV, 33, that God said to Moses: \"the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein\" but by the blood of him that shed it.\". In Christian doctrine, however, God may be appeased by the tra~sgiessor's voluntary acc~ptance of punisr~ent~ the desire for the punishrnent\" bOeing the cond~}tion of his being cl eansed of his sin. Rather than insisting on. or prescribing the punishment, God insists 6n the penance, or the contrition combined l'lith the de.sire to make amendments; and the punishment serves only the secondary purpose of allowing the trans- gressor-to demonstrate that he is truly penitent. The political significance of this consists in this: whereas God knows \\vhether the transgressor .is truly penitent, and knows it without th~ actual imposition of the pUI'l;ishment\" a -; state I 5 penal. author~ties, lacking the power to. examine the human heart, will require a demon.stritj,;on, and this can consist only \"in the voluntary acceptance of punishment. Stated otherlVise~ penitence requires the' transgressor, the law-breaker~ to punish him~elf rather than for the state to inflict punishment .on him. The state m~es punishment available to him as a kind of welfare service; if he accepts it l'lillingly, he . demonstrates that he is penitent -and also demonstrates the success of the penitentiary system. If he does not., he demonstl.\"ates that he is not penitent I', ,e I !\\:o . e' e e e -23 - and is' not fit to be released. In the event, of course, it will ElJ.3?pear that the state is inflicting the punishment on the offender, and in this way a .(~~~ 'p\u00a3i\"ni tential, or penitentiary, ?ys~em is only too likely to resemble expiation \", . :'P'~~i .' ~\".'l except that it is a wrathful state, rather than a god,.tp.at is ,being appeased.

Indeed, even the recidivism rate is not that precise a measure,. since in one study it may involve minor parole violations and, in another, actual arrests for the commission of crimes. At a'IJ.y' rate, hundreds of programs have been instituted and evaluated in one 1fay or another, and the resulting eyaluati ve studies have recently been.subj~cted to a scrupulous review by Robert Martinson, an kleriy;;m criminologist.

For e~<:a.tnple, the success claimed for the California o Youth Authority Community Treatment Project was found to be the result of the tendency of the probation officers to discriminate in favor of the experimentaJ. group and against the control group.

'3. Conclusion: Blaming Crime on Society The penal reform movement began. in the United States when Benjamin '. Rush, moved by compassion and a faith in science, said that the first purpose < ;.\"t, of punishment iv-as reform of the punishment least calculated to crblln\\l.l. Since the death penalty was the !f Ii (( achhwe that end, it \\IJas to be replaced by the penitentiaries where. criminals would be caused to repent and to learn, to liv:i;{\u00b7l[J.e,Q lives. In the course of time, the agents of this reformation changed \" from priests to general medical practitioners to social workers and psychia- trists, duri~g which repentance gave way to rehabilitation or adjustment, and \"<\" cure. In his characterization of the struggle over the death penalty since Beccaria's time, Thorsten Sellin, as I indicated earlier, spoke of the con- tending forces as the ancient and deeply rooted b~liefs in retribution, atonement or vengeance on the one hand, and, on the other, beliefs in the personal value and dignity of the common man.\"*** It is not by chance, however, that the reform penology \"has profoundly undeinocraticconseqUf;mces. Not only .. Doing Justice: The Choice of Punishments, Committee\u00a3or the Study of Incarceration (New York: , ,~ ~ \"\"\", IN ' -41- \", does it subj ect prisoners to courses ofi, treatment against their ldll_ a: fact that has caused it to be criticized by prisoners and criminologists alike-but .~ . it substitutes rule by th~ few for rule by the people. Whether a part~.c~lar .. /---\\' I.; mode of punishment or treatment \\'fi11 effect the reform of the criminal is a.n issue on \\vh1ch the public mayor may not have opinions, but it is riot an issue in whose resolutiorl the public's opinion should be given any weight, eveIi.:in a\" democrasy. It is not a question of justice but of medicine and, as such, shQuld be turned over to the experts in medicine, the psychiatrtsts or whatever. Whether a particular criminal is j,n fact reformed is, of' course, a que,stion of fact, and should be answered by those who are al(lTIe qualified to answer it. They will determine when a criminal is cured and, therefore, they will determine the' length of sentence. Hence, the public's notion of justice that is embodied i~ .\"J every schedule of punishment TI~st be superseded by indeterminate sentences, and, j.n penology, democracy must be superseded by what might be called I!'-' , psychotocr.acy. . The\"'::,belief in the IIpersonal value and dignity of the common mand does not include a belief in hiscaPilCity to decide questions .of punishmeht. Common .. men serve on juries and mete out death s.entences; uncommon men serve on \".J the Supreme Court and set aside those sentences, accusing juries of being .. arbitrary, capricious, bigbted,- cruel. Common men cO;f1tinue to be moved by the. concern for the iitnessthat we call justice and that manifests itself in the J) rul~ that people should get what they .(deserve; our .uncommon reformers insist that the issue is not one of justice\u00b7 but o~ medicine. Having said this, I must inunediately qualify it: there is a school of /'-, reformers that is very much concerned ,'lith ll\"hat they riJtderstand to be justice.\" It is preciseiy their concern.for justice that prevents them from following. 0 the trend in criminologyall\"ay from the rehabiiitativ.e model.. and toward the' i- (! ,> puni ti ve I:lodel. 'l'hey agree that l\"efo:nn and rehabilitation them a,pr:l.rt Morris, .\u00b7for exampl~, is their insistence tho.t .:.\" .punishment is unjust. And what sets them apart from the earliEr refortJ.ers is their:'opinion that society is unjust and~ because it is tffijust, has no right either ,to punish or to treat criminals. In their vievr, criminology has been at .fault because it .looked for the causes of crime in t!'Je sow. or body of the' criminal, whereas they are actually to be found in society or in the 1I\u00b7~onditions.\" . It follows that it is. the \"rotten If society or the \"system\" that must be reformed, not those ifhom it labels, criminals. as the .~erican Friends Service Committee sees it, most crimes are I, com .. !lit\"tJ;~{f by tne nagenc:t~s of government,,\" just as most murders have been * co~~tted by govel!Unents.

The sight of crime and the criminal arouses anger, but the sight of someone suffering \\<lith a disease arouses compassion for him. Anger with crime is naturally combined with compassion for the victims of crimes, and this is as it should be: persons who are angry with crime and criminals and feel s9rry for the victims of crime are likely to be law-abiding citizens. And the legal system that allmvs them 'to express that anger (or expresses it in their name) and to express that compassion is a legal system that is doing a pr;Per job; it is teaching the lesson. that a society of law must somehow teach.

A good deal of ingenuity was' employed in devising painful pun.ishments, and, if \\'1e are to judge by \\vhat \\vas done, the purpose of pre-modern punislunent 'vas simply to cause pain. This is no lo~ger the case. The purpose of modern punishment (to the extent that punishment is pennitted) is, in principle, to instill fear. This change is the consequence of a change in the ends of civil society itself, Criminal 1m'l refonn began 200 years ago '''hen B~ccaria applied to crimes and punishments the liberal principles delineated by the philosophers of natural rights. These rights were possessed in the state of nature but they were not enjoyed there because the state of nature resembled too closely the state of war of ev~ry man against every man. To se.cure these rights, governments, had to be instituted'among men; to provide this security became the chief end of govenunent, which is to say that peace, * Na~ Weber~ On Lm'l in Economy and Society, ed.

His experience convinced Hobbes~ the first of the natural rights philosophers,* that peace was endangered most of all by the seditious doctrine (which he called \"one of the diseases of a commonwealth\") according to which every private man is jUdge. of good and evil actions and of the justice and injustice of the laws. This doctrine, so per-. ' nicious in its consequences, was fostered most of all by the clergy- Hobbes' \"ghostly\" or \"spiritual\" authority -and so long as the' power of the clergy remained intact, men would continue to offer the sovereign,only . a conditional obedience because they would fear eta'rnal damnation more. than the sovereign's laws. This subjected the commonwealth to the con- tinual and IIgreat danger of civi~war and dissolution.\"** PeJ.ce, then, required that men'be rid of this unreasonable fear of \"the power of spirits invisible\";*** peace required enlightenment. The enlightened sovereign wO~1ld subordinate thespiri tual authority and, in Beccaria's words, \"see to it that men fear the laws and fear nothing else.\"**** The true measure of crinles was not in their intrinsic character but in the \"harm done to society.\" This palpable truth, so long obScured by the clergy working on \"the timid credulity of men,\" would, as a consequence of the \"present enlightenment, \"***** soon be made evident to everyone.

'r'nere are a number of reasons for this, the most obvious being the \\\\liffi~ ,\\ . \\, culty in identifying the effect of one' among factors \"that probably aff~:t; . . ~ , . ~ the murder rate. Just as we have r.eason to believe that a soybean pla....'1t, to '\\. \\~\" \\' choose a simple illustration, req,uires more 'than slL.'1light to grow to its \\, optimum height, '\\{e suspect that the murder rate depends on factors in addition '. . to the severity and kinds of punishrlents imposed on murderers; in fact, we suspect that many more (and pore obscure) factors are involved than in the case 'of soybean culture.

He might also speculate ' that the number of murders-by-shooting depends on the number o~ handguns in ~he co~nunity, and whether a license is required to purchase a~d carry them, ~,d on their cost. It is also possible that the murder rate is sensitive to the w.ount of ' violence ShOlffi on television, a~ , ... ell as to the amount of poverty and unemployment, or depends on the e~ficiency of the police, the state o~--, medical scienc.e, the proportion of the populat}on in a particular age group, and so on. To isolate the effect of anyone of 'j:;hese f'actors--say, the rate of executiqns--it is necessary to hold. constant all the others\" Whicb,\\\\ SOWlds sinple b~t is . . -. thi~ ,problem by st;tldy'.ing the homicide rates\"'in '~ l I- I, I .0 -7-I. contiguous states, some with and some without the death penalty, on the as sump- tion that these states \"are as alike as possible in character of population> social. and economic conditions, etc. \" His conclusion was that the death * . penalty has no ei'1'ect on the murder rate, and most criminologists 'were convinced. R~ by his study, even though Sellin did not succeed in overcoming all the di1'ficul- t' ties involved in this kind 01' study. In the first place, Sellin J,ooked for correlations between the ho!r1icide rate and the 'legal status of the death penalty, rather than the number of execu- tions actually carried out in the states where it was a legal punishment; but the nUmber of executions is much more likely than the mere legal existence of the penalty to have an effect on potential killers. Then, ~though j.t may be true that contiguous states are similar with respect to the sociological factors that are thought to 'impinge on tlie homicide rate, it may also not be true; and without thorough investigation, which he did not underta..~e, Sellin hadn~~ay of knowihg whether the states he assumed to be equal in all respects except in the punislnnents they authorized. for homicide were, for one example, equally adept in apprehending and convicting those who committed it. All of which is to say that this sort of simple cross-state comparison, even a cross- contiguous-state comparison, does not and cannot adequately \"control\" for the other factors. This difficulty can be avoided by studyil?-g the murder rate within a state that has abolished the death penalty and then (most convenient~ for the social science researcher) reimposed it. Unfortunately, most of the states that abolished the dea.th penalty did so J.l'....!lnY years a.go (.Hichigan was the :first in 1846) when the statistics are either unavailable ,or especially unreliable. On the\u00b7 basis of the information that is available, however, Professor Sellin ~e!lched the conclusion reported above. But aga.In there is an obvious dif1'iculty: * Thorsten Sellin, The Death Penaltr., A Report.for the Nodel Penal Code Project ot:, t~~!Am~rican Institute (Philadelphia, 1959), p.' 63.. \u00b7\"\\\"'i.(~:,~:,;,:.:,t\",;:'J\u00b7n~)j C;,. ,/ .1' I !

'. i/ -8- whereas a f'actors that -\" may di:ffer :frdm state to state, a simple cross-time comparison within one state cannot \"control\" :for the factors that may di:f:fer :from time to time. Then there is the problem o:f distinguishing between incapacitation and deterrence. It is entirely possible that the death penalty prevents murders~ but only because it prevents y~o~~murderers from committing additional murde~s . , . , ' and not because it \"deters\" potential murd<=rers. The distinction is obv:iousiy or direct relevance to the deterrence issue, because known mUrde~ers can be inca2acitated by imprisoning them (if we ignore the problem of ~he murders D they commit in prison and the p~ssibility that they might escape) as well as by executing t,hem. ' One other ait'ficulty deserves mention. vlhereas the plant scientist can assume that the height of' a ~oybean plant may depend on the amount o:f sunlight it receives, his testing of this assumption is not compli'cated by the necessity to consider the possibility that the amount of' sunlight may be af'fected by '-, the height or his soybeans. T'ne social scientist cannot ignore,:.;the equivalent assumption concerning executions ,and the murder rate. While executions nu~y , ,\" tend to produce a decline in the murder rate, it is entirely possible that both the number and rate of' executions increase with the murder rate. The reason . u ~ :for-this is that when the murder rate is high, or is perceJ.V'ed to be high, judges and juries may impose the death sentence on a larger :proportion o:f convicted murderers than when it is low or is percei yea to be low. Thus, the number or \". executions m~ be both cause and efi'ect of the murder rate. One implication of this' is that an increase in the number or e:JSecutions \"caused\" by an increase in the murder rate lllaY' appear to be an incre~e' iti'the murder rate \"cam>edu t;- ;' \" the number of' executions. !: N~ si.Inple technique can distinguish \" the two~ Then, again, jpries may be relucta~tto convict ,under a:' statute that '1 \" ..\" \" () -9- in verdicts of guilty ot' one degree or another ot' manslaughter. I' Thls' woul'd give the aPJ>earance of a ~'ase where the threat o.t' capital punishment II causes\" a Despite these technica.l dif.ficulties, there have been a number of studies ot' deterrence in addition.tothose conducted by Professor Sellin, and, until recently, there was a ~~itor.mity and consistency in their finw.ngs. In the words of l'Torval Morris and Gordon Hawkins, the conclusion t~at emerges from thes~ l?tudies, \"and from all the literature a.~d research reports on the death ./'\\.\\ . pe\\2;~f~ty is, to ~he point of monotony: the existence or nonexistence of capital punishment is irrelevant to the murder, or attempted murder, rate. TI This, they \\ .. ,' * sa:y, flis as well established as eny other proposition in social s\u00b7cience.1! Other researchers ,have denied this and, in the course of doing so, have suggested that th~/yriminologists were convinced by the studies because. they 'Wanted to be convinced. It has been said that the studies on which t)1ey rely w'er.e underta..~en under the assumption that punishment in general does not deter crime in ** general. Hugo Adam Bedau, perhaps the best kno ...... -n of America' s abolitionists, lent some substance to this charge when he conceded that some criminologists were skeptical of the death penalty's capacity to deter bec8;use they doubted *** the capacity of any punishment to deter \"crimes of personal violence.\" Such an opinion would appear to be extravagant (and Bedau does not share it), but it is held by reputable criminologists. As recently as 1967 Walter Reckless, in the fourth edition of his textbook, said flatly that punishment *1 \" Norval l-Iorris and Gordon Hawkins, I From Murder and Violence, Good Lord, Dellver Us,\" r\u00b7fidvN\", .vql. 10 (Summer, 1969), p. .

Tnis position reflects the simplistic notio~, too commonly prevailing in matters of socie~ action, that nothing has been achieved-merely because not everything is accomplished that ve should like. It is sometimes said that high crime r~tes prove that sanctions do not deter or that pencn'ties actually inn te the crimes or men who seek ptmishment to dissolve their feelings of guilt.

Canada's decision in 1967 to'cabolisl;l capital punishment for a trial. period of f'i veyears provided criminologists with a good opportunity to observe the consequences of this cha..\"lge in the penal la\u00b7\".

The gains appear in his nodel of' the rlmurder supply function\" iIi the form of annual statistics respecting the u...\"1employment rate, the labor force participation rate and an estimate of real per capita income; which is to say, he made the asstunption that the gains to be won by mur- del\" will be related to the economic factors expressed in these statistics. The f~rmer (the probable costs) appear as statistics, from the same years, ,.respecting the probability of murderers being apprehended, then con.victed and ., ... then executed. With these he included statistics of the percentage of the population in the age group 14-25 in each of' the years stuclied, tIE assumption being (and it is a 'fell-founded assumption) that this group has a higher propensity to commit murders. His hypothesis was that the murder rate is dependent on these eigh~ variables in a particular relationship both to each . that other and to murder, ana/these relationships can be eXpressed mathematically in a set of simultaneous equations.

One of the. frequently-used arguments against the death penal ty is . ./ that murder is a crime that cannot be deterred. It is insisted that, beyond ...... all others J murder is a crime of passion J a. cr'ime committed by wife against husband, or husband against \\vife, or under the influence df alcohol by friend against .erstwhile friend, and., on the whole, the statist-ics bear this out. Whereas persons tend overwhelmingly to commit their armed robberies against strangers, they tend to murder their friends, lovers and acquaintances and to do 'so in the familiar surroundings of the home.* Acting in a fit of passion, murderers are incapable of a yational calculation of costs and benefits, and, th'erefore, it is argued, incapable of being deterred by the threat of capital punishment. But the same argument leads to the conclusion that they are in- capable of being deterred by the threat of any punishment; and if deterrence is the only purpose of punishment, and if no punishment can deter the typical murderer, then it \\lIould seem that the law is wasting its ti~e and our money when it punishes him. Rehabilitation (even if it were possible) is irrelevant here: a'murderer is the le.ast likely of criminals to repeat his crime --Henry . Jarrett~ is an exception to the rule --so nothing'is accomplished by incapacitating him, either by executing him or ~mprisoning him. The 11 f ~ ~ ~ t * Sourcebook of Criminal Justice Statistics -1974, pp. 246, 247. . . (l ., -26- ;', conclusion to which this argument leads is not'merely that murderers ought not .' .;'~\"''if: to be executed, but that they ought not even be imprisoned, or, for that matter J ;,~,~, atTested. In fact, murder ought not to be considered a criminal offense. , ..... ;:. .. \\'i,. In addition to leading to conclusions that no sane man will accept, ,\",-t;- this argument fails to prove what it sets ou~ to prove.~\"fl The fact that murder J}. tends to be a crime of passion does not prove that murder cannot be deterred by the threat of severe punishment. It ispos.sible that precisely becau.se of the severe punishments prescribed, murders tl=lnd to be committed, On the whole, only by those unable to l<leigh the possible costs against the probable --' . benefi ts. Others, even those \\'/ho stand to gain by murdering (and most of us are in this category), are deterred by the costs, or may be deterred by them. At least, the crime of passion argument does nothing to cast doubt on the possibility that lye are deterred by the threat of punishment: Who \\'/ould be so bold as to preq.ict that the murder rate would not rise if murderers l.,rere n,ot punished in any way? Besides, lye know as a fact that the number of murders tends to :rise with the crime rate in general- and not only in Ii America -\\'/hich suggests that a significant numbe:r of murders are being cOIrll'ni tted \"incold blood\" by persons other than jealous ,husbands or forsaken .. ~'-.\"\" .. lovers. Interestingly enough, this proves to be true. In 1966, 16 .. 3 percent of all murders were \\\"hat the FBI'refers to as \"Spouse-spouse\" murders; this proportion dropped steadily 1.ll1til ,:>in 1974, it reached 12.1 percent. rvr6re or less the same thing happened respecting the proportions of' murde~s comnitted by parents, \"other relatives,\" and by those involved in \"romantic triangles and lovers 'quarrels.\" The proportion ; 0 of I~il1ings aris'ing out room brm'l1s) reni'ained in 1966 and ;4'0',(!;; percent1.:n. 1974). . '\u00b7~~t The on~ category that shewed a marked increase is These constituted 14.8 percen,t of the total in 1966 . ~. , . and 22.2 percent in 1974.* More murders and a greater proportion of murders . ' , are being committed by professional criminals in \"cold blood\" in the course of com .. '11itting other felonies. In New York City, 1,645 homicides were c~mmittedin 1975, and more than a third of these were classified as \"stranger murders,\" the highest rate ?-.n the country. Such murder cases are more di ffi cuI t to -solve, and l~e can. expect that as the proportion of them rises,' the proporti.on of cases \"cleared\" or solved \\>[i11 drop and that the proportion of ,murderers puniShed Hill also drop. New York police managed to make arrests in m'1ly 64.5 percent of its homicide:' cases in 1975, which was the lowest \"clearance\" rate among the large American cities.** My point is a simple one: if crime in general could. be deterred more effectively, murder in particular m~.ght also be deterred more effectively. Crime \"in general is not now being deterred because, compared to the amount ii of crime, almost no one is being punishfld, and almost no one is being punished partly because our judges do not believe in punishment. They still believe in rehabilitation . It is no longer fashionable to deny that the crime rate is \u00b7increasing and doing so at a ra.te that, however grudgingly j dralvs acknowledgment from persons formerly disposed to deny it. We know about the crime rate from '.-' the FBI f sUnifonn Crime Reports. and while these annu'al reports are less \"reliable than we would like them to be, they are no less reliable t.his year * Unifo~ Crime Reports, 1972 (p. 9) and 19'74 (p,' 19) ** The ,Nell{ York Sunday Times, June 13, 1976 pp., 1 and (J --~---~~~-~ -~----~---;c- ------ , -28- than last, nor were tl1ey less reliable last year than the year before. It ,.\"~Js also true that an ... 1.~;. appreciable part of the increase is attributable to . . ~- i~~i. disproportionate growth in' the younger age group which, we know as a\u00b7 . '.:' fact, commits a disproportionate part\u00b7 of the crime, Stlil, deriving all the comfort we can from such factors; the amount\\\\ of crime and the rate of crime are increasing,- and almost everyone (except, of course\" Jessica Mitford) admits it. There l'lere, for example, 10, 192 index crimes known to have been corrunitted in the Unitea States fJuring the year 1974, *. an increase Q.f 203 percent over 1960; in this same period, the per capita .c,rime rate (crimes per 100,000 population) jumped from 1875.8. to 4821.4, an increase of 157 percent. Of particular interest here is the number of murders: '20 ~600 in 1974 and 9,0?O in 1960. This is an increase of 127 percent, and an ~. increase in the murder rate of 90 percent. In this-same period,the rate of forcible rapes increased 175 percent; robberies, percent; aggravated vehicle thefts, 153 percent.** Thus, the public'$ perception that crime is a l'lorsening problem is ~_ ,I borne out by the statistics; so too is the public's perception th~t not much ,~: c is being done about it. The police.manage to mGkeoan arrest in approximately 20 percent of the cases, but only a small portion of those arrested are actually convicted in the courts, and a still smaller portion punished. The * Index crimes (the category is theFBl's) comp:r.ise\u00b7 (1) murder andnormegligent ~ manSlaughter, (2) forcible rape, (3) robbery, (4) aggravated assaultlo(5) burglary, (6)-larceny-theft, and (7) motor vehicle thefts. . Reports, 1974,p. 55. o\u00b7 \",' '. -29- -\" figures are as follows (per 100 index crimes * .' Arrests ......... ., offense .... 0.8 Persons acquitted or dismissed ........ 2.4 Juveniles referred to juvenile courts ... 5.8 Thus, for every 100 index crimes reported to the,police ~here are 5.8 convictions, not counting the convictions in the juvenile courts. The number of these is not reported, but 'if we assume that thase courts convict half the offenders referred to them, the total conviction rate is 8.7 percentj which is to say, that for everyone hundred index crimes known to have been committed there are 8.7 convictions. This means that an estimated 91.3 percent of the reported crimes go unpunished. But the s'ituation is actually worse because most crimes are not reported This fact had long been suspected and now, thanks to the victimization surveys conducted by the Census Bureau for the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, it has been verified. Information in these victimization reports is obtained from twice-yearly interviews with a national representative sample of 60') 000 households and 15, 000 businesses, \\'lho are asked to report the specific crimes committed against them during the period covered. Exc.ept that murder is not included, the crimes surveyed are roughly equivalent to the FBI's index crimes. What we learn, among o~her things tl is that there is a marked ~ispari ty~bet''I'een the nUmber of crimes reported ,to the police (and recorded by the FBI) and the number of ci'imes committed., \" *lbia.; p. 176. These statistics, the only on'es available, are drawn from the rt;ports of 1496 cities. I am (l,sswning that the same rates appl.y in the .country as a whole. ';--'\" '- -30- , -. '; Thus, for example, in 1973 the FBI reported the rate o~ forcible rape to be 24.3 per 100,000, and the National Crime Survey. reported it to be 100, or four times greater; and the robbery rate as recorded by the FBI was 198.4 and, as reported by the victims, 690*. In a press release of April 15, 1974, the LEAA Administrator at that time, Donald E. Santarelli; indicated that only 37 percent of the crimes suffered by Detroiters were reported to the police, and this figure was not out of line with the survey resul ts in other cities covered in the report. *~' (The figures mentioned , .. ere 36 percent [Chicago] > 34 percent [Los Angeles], 47 percent [New York] and 20 percent [Philadelphia].) These data suggest, then, that the true amount of crime is in the order of three times greater than 'vhat is re- ported by the FBI. If so, the total of index crimes actually committed in 1974 was 30,576,000. This means that if there are 8.7 convictions- for \" everyone hundred recorded index crimes, there are only 2~gconvictions -, . for everyone hundred crimes connni tted, ,.,rhich is to say that 97.1 percent of the crimes committed go unpunished (assuming, for the moment,that everyoz:e convicted is punished).

D'espite the fact that the number of index crimes known to the police increased from 3;363,700 in 1960 to 8,666,200 in 1973, an increase of 158 percent, the total number of persons in federal and state prisons a.ctually declined.* There are many more criminals, but they are not in prison. IfeN/e exclude probation from the category of punishm,ent, we arrive at this conClusion: 2.9 convictions for everyone hundred crimes committed, and half of those convicted are punished. Hence; 98.5 percent of the crimes committed go unpunished. This ,surely, is a situation that Hobbes and Beccaria did not foresee when they first advanced the prpposition that the purpose of punishment is to instill fear of the sovereign's lat'ls . Rather than fearing ,the laws, American criminals have good reason to regard them with contempt . Judges are ~reluctant to punish because the idea of punishment fell \" into disrepute in prestigious iegal ciTcles. Part of a la1Qyer's, and especially a judge's, education has been that the use of punishment sh~Uld be avoided. The American Law Institute's Model Penal Code (which is one of the most influential legal documents of the past fe,., decades) instructs judges to avoid imprisoning a convicted criminal except (i) to incapacitate him, (ii) to rehabilitate him, or (iii) when necessary to avoid depreciation of the seriousness of his offense. Thus, withholding a sentence of imprisonment is to be the rule and imprisonment is to be the exception, and from the sentencing section itself one might conclude that no one should (* .!Ql4., pp. 471, 434. There were 212,953 pris,one;rs -34- be ilrinpri~oned in order to deter others from committing similar offenses. ok i~: :~~:~ The I same principle animated the Council of Judges of 'the National' Council n . . on Crime and Delinquency ~ ... hen, even in the second edition of their Model '. ::,<'c'?~Sentencing Act (published in 1972); they provided, that, except for dangerous .\". ,~. i:f\\: ~ffenders\" \"persons convicted of crime shall be dealt Nith in accordance \" , Hith their potential for rehabilitation, considering their ~ndividual characteristics, ciTcumstances and needs.\" ,In the comment accompanying '; this article, they acknOl'lfedge that while \"some persons\" including. a few ,members of the Council of Judges, maintain that punishment per se has a proper place in a sentence, the consensus is that the term \"punishmentU :) standing alone is vague.\"** (This sentence is itself vague, but its implication seems clear enough: the Council of Judges is persuaded that !,J criminals ought not to be punished.) * The American LaN Institute, Model Penal Code, Proposed Final Draft (Philadelphia, July 30, 1962)~' p. 106.

He is firmly convinced, he says, that not only are too many persons sentenced to prison terms that are fal' too long (an opinion that can be supported l'l~th persuasive evidence), but that \"too many people\" are being imprisoned.** Hence, he, too, even as he complains of statutes providing for indeterminate sentences, calls for \"creative thought\" to be given to rehabilitation .~~ prograpls '~--=='\"~~- i; l:tke, as if there were some reason (but he knows there is none***) to believe that .rehab,i1itation works. Admittedly, there are gross,:-,\\disparities in sentencing, but the evidence' reviewed above suggests that for every, \"hanging judge\" lvho imposes excessively severe sentences, there are several whose illusions or softness cause them to err in the opposite direction. The fact is that a \"shockingly large number [of criminals] go unpunished\", as a recent task force report puts it, and that this has \"seriously affected the deterrent value of criminal sanctions. \"****HO\\'1 could it be otherwise' \" * Harvin E.

In this situation, the question is not \\'ihy so many. persons commit crimes but why so many persons do not commit crimes, when, from a certain point of view, it is obviously in their interest to do so. They are laboring under an illusion if they are being restrained by the fear of punishment.\u00b7 ~he possibility of being punished is altogether remote; it is remote not only because of the difficulty of catching criminals, but because o~ the unwill~ngness' of the courts to punish them when caught and convicted, and also because of the difficulty of convicting them.* 4. The Court Problem ,From the beginning crirdnology has asserted, that if punishment has, any capacity to deter crimes'(and in the beginning there was no doubt about this), it consisted in its certainty and in the promptness of itsimposition~ Beccaria made these t\\'lO arguments in consecu~cive chapters of his treatise. \"One of the greatest curbs on (crime\", he said,\"is not the cruelty of punishments.. but their infallibility\", and the ,\"more promptly and the more closely punishment follows upon the commission of a crime .. the more just and useful h will,be.\" He therefore, in true.

Defendants (even, apparently, those in custody) favor delay because it enhances their chances of having the charges 'against them reduced or even dropped: lvitnesses may disappear, become discouraged, forget, or even die. Defense attorneys favor delay because it serves as a means to enable them to collect their fees (Katz reports that this is a common practice*), because it enables them'to accept more cases that\",lthey couldJl . ' under a more rigid calendar, handle, and because, l'lhen acting as court-s appointed attorneys, the fee structure discourag~'r going to trial. ** I,,~) But the law-abiding community is penalized by delays; unfortunately, as Katz says, this community is simply not adequately \"represented in the courts, and the courts permit delay. JlBetween defendants and Im'lyers- and it must be .. kept in mind that judges and prosecutors are lmvyers too- the procedures are being neatly emasculated to ensure that only 'their .respective interests are protected ,11*** (Katz himself is a lawyer.) ;:'t There is a need for more judges and other court personnel, and ~ good deal of effort is being exerted to make the courts more efficient: comput~~f;S to assist .in record keeping and scheduling, for example, and nel~ management *Katz, Justice is the Crime, pp. 42, 76-77, **They are paid more for a case that is tried~ but the differential is not enough to justify the necessity to accept fewer cases, Trials are'time\u00ad consuming.'

But trial judges are not solely responsible for the inefficiency of our criminal justice system. Some cases are tried-- and tried and tried-- but final judgment does not typically follow immediately upon the con- elusion of the trial. When a case begins with a s.earch or arrest warrant, or a wire-tap, or when it depends on a confession, and when the defendant enjoys the assistance of assiduous or pertinacious counsel, the opportunities for avoiding final judgment are almost limitless. Fleming says such a defendant may be able to \"postpone the day of final judgment to Armageddon,\"** and for this he blames the Supreme Chief Justice Warren ~, Court, and particularly the Court under A defendant abo~t to be tried in a state court may begin by asking a federal court to enjoin the state prosecution' on the ground that the statute under which he is to be tried is unconstitutional on its face or is one whose enforcement \\vould have a \"chilling\" effect on the exercise * Ibid.\" p'. 79. ** Fleming, TIle 'Price of Perfect Justice,p. 27 \\) ,' ..

Fleming calls these techniques llpreconviction s!mttles. rr If the defendant is nevertheless finally convicted.. he call begin the postconviction relief journey through the state's\" appellate system and then to the Supreme Court of the United States. Ev.en if he loses in each of these courts and i:sfinally imprisoned.. he is not yet 11i thout remedy. The next st,ep is one made more readily available by the Sup:rame Court some tl'lenty years ago I'lhen it affirmed the right of a state defendant, whose conviction,flas already been affirmed on direct appeal, to apply to a federal district court for habeas corpus. If this is denied, he can then appe\"l.lthe denial to the federal Court of Appeals and, finally~ to the Supreme Court of the United States again. The number of habeas corpus petitions filed annually by state prisoners now exceeds 12,000, $ome 2, 000 of which reach the Supreme Court. ** . It is inevitable that procedures so solicitous of a defendant's interests \\'1i1l produce cases that make criminal justice appear ridiCUlOUS, and Fleming provides an example of one: * Dombrowski v.

I't is always possible (although, ~ \"!\"'-since the advent of the Burger court, not likely) _that the Supreme Court .:~(. \\>lin announce a new constitutional rule of criminal procedure and then apply the ntle retroactively, thus making it possible for Bates' and Chavez to have a new trial and, assuming thy \\'Ii tnesses are sti1l available to testify and the evidence has not been destroyed, if they are again convicted, to begin the appeals process once again. The retroactive application of the rule of Gideon v.

On :ixteen occasions (as I count them) the state and federal courts examined this trial and, finally, pronounced it a fair one at the time it took place, but it is not impossible that in the future it will be found to be unfair according to some standard still to be set. Yet, as Fleming says, it has never been controverted \"that Bates threl.,the gasoline on the floor of the Mecca Bar:; that Chavez threw a book of lighted matches on the gasoline, and that six persons died in the ensuing holocaust.\"*** Punishment in America, even after conviction, ,is neither infallible nor prompt. ~\\ ) * Gideon v~ Waim.,right, \u00b7372 U.S. 335 (1963). op. cit., p. 15. *** Ibid.~ p. 29; , --- \" -46 .~ In our present\u00b7 situation, it is easy to find fault with our manner of conducting criminal trials and to overlook the faults in other systems. It is, for exmnple, deplorable that so much time is spent impaneling an American jury (five 1.\u00b7reeks in the trial of the notorious Charles Manson and \"family\"), and it is easy to envy the British and Canadians who lUan\u00a7l:ge to impanel a jury in a matter of minutes or hours. But there is another side to this,. as a recent Canadian example serves to illustrate. In the province of Manitoba the names of prospective jurors are taken at random from the voters I lists and the jurors are not routinely questioned before appearing for duty. Nor are defense counsel permitted to interrogate them in order, ostensibly at least, to discover whether ,f>iey have opinions \" ) . . on the case. Fair enough, one is inclined to say: much m~re efficient than allowing all those peremptory challenges and evidentiary hearings on the composition of juries ,\\'Ii th their allegations of discr~mination of one sort or another. Unfortunately, a recent attempted-murder trial in Mani toba' ended:\u00b7 in a mistrial when, after three days of testimony, it Has discovered that two of the jurors could not understand English and a third was so deaf that by his (;}lvn admission he was able to hear only about half of what had been said in the trial. *.

No federal official in the United States has an authority over local police equivalent to that enjoyed by the British Home Secretary, for example. The Supreme Court made the exclusionary rule into a rule of constitutional law only because there seemed to be no othel~ way of getting the police to behave properly . Yet, r the rule has been of no use in this regard. As even Leonard Levy admits (and Levy is one'of the Warren Court1s strongest supporters), the impact of the rule \"misses the police and falls upon prosecutors.1I The police can con~inue their illegal searches, seizures, and interrogations without suffering any penalty deriving from the exclusionary rule (the prosecutors suffer the penalty); indeed, the rule cannot conceivably reach those cases \\\\Ihere a remedy is most evidently needed: illegal searches in- volving innocent persons.

After all, I there is a difference betiveen the :rights of a defendant and his interest. ,His rights are described in the Constitution and in the rules of criminal procedure; his interests is to escape punishment. Justice.Bxennan once said, in a case concerning the availability of federal postconviction remedies, that ~conventional notions of finality of litigation have no place where life or liberty is at stake and in:fringemelit of constitutional rights is alleged.\"** It is instructive to calculate how' often this occurs. Liberty is at stake in every case in 'vhich the accused <,' has been found guilty and sentenced to a tern of imprisonment; allegations of infringement of a constitutional right are made in almost all cases .~.f) appealed. How many cases are appealed? Leaving aside the cases tried in state courts (for which the relevant statistics are m;available), in. 1974- a total of 36,229 persons were fou?d guilty in the United States District '* Fleming, The Price of Perfect Justice1 pp. 31-36\" ** :,-. -49-'.

J~, e . . 406~7, or 64 percent, filed appeals in the United States Courts.o\u00a3 Appeals.* Justice Brennan's statement means, then, that conventional notions of finality of litigation have no place in the typical or IIconventionalll federal criminal case. Prestunably the British are as determined as we are to prevent illegal imprisonments and convictions of innocent persons, put they nevertheless have designed a judicial system in which,. by our standards, appeals are rarely taken. I11 1974, a total of , 374,918 persons we.re found guilty of indictable offenses in the courts of England and Wales; there is no ''lay of knowing from what has been published how many of these entered pleas!of guilty and hO\\\\I many were fo~nd guilty after trial, but of the :total; only 4481 applied for,leave to appeal, or approximately 1.2 percent**. The parallel American figure is 11.2 percent, or about tell times greater.

A person _ \" \" ,1:.; ~ ~,[f;t:t;t named Db\\mum and three others were charged with mail theft and with forging ;.: '. ?:~; (and \"uttering\") checks stolen from the mails. The three co-defendants .' /J pleaaed guilty, but DO\\\u00b7dtum elected to stand trial. The case was called and both sides announced they \"\"ere ready to proceed. The jury \"\"as selected~ . sworn and then immediately instructed to ret~rn at 2.00 p.m. the same afternoon. During the recess, the prosecutor learned that he l1ad been misinformed, that his key witness was not in fact present; he informed the judge of this during. the recess ,and, when the court reconvened, he immediately asked ~hat the jury be discharged.. His motion lvas granted . TlVO days later, a second jury \\'las impaneled and DOi~lltun, after complaining of double jeopardy .. \\qas convicted. The Court of Appeals affirmed, but the Supreme:: Couit reversed and Downum \\vas set free. * Now the Fifth Amendment provides that no person should be subject for the same offense \"to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb\", and it does ,\"\" so in order to pr'event the harassment of an accused by successive prosecutions, or to prevent declarations of a mistrial so as to afford t~e prosecution .. ;: a more favorable opportunity to convict in a subsequent tria'L Douglas made these points.

Rather than to resolve any doubt in favor of the defendant, a reasonable person would more likely contend that in this case' there was little if any doubt ,to resolve. A Court capable of the ,pownum decision is not one that believes that the primary rpnction of a criminal trial is to determine the ~ilty and bring him to justice. Consider another example from the Warren Court .era. Harrison con\u00ad fessed to the crime of felony murder. At the trial\" in order to overcome the effect of the confessions he had made to the police during interrogation, ,\\ J(., ' Harrison took the stand, which he WaS'flOt required to do, and his own' testimony placed, him at the scene of the crime. He '''as convicted, but the Court of Appeals held his confessions inadmissible and ordered him to be retried.

But the Supreme' Court reversed, holding that 1:':.:::: his oral testimony in the first trial was inadmissible in the second. The Court acknOlvledged that the established rule ai,lowed testimony in a former trial to be admitted in subsequent proceedings, but insisted that the rul~ did not apply here because his testimony was not really voluntary; it had been \"impelled\" by the necessity to counteract. the confessl.onswhich ,vere S \" 0 later held to be inadntissible.

In each case, this is self-incrimination) Which the Fifth Amendment forbi<!1s; this is compeliing a\u00b7 person to be a lvitness against himself. * This is also going to excessive lengths to avoid authorizing punishment of a confessed murderer. 5. Conclusion The Supreme Court is not final because it is infallible, as Justice \"'\\, Jackson once said in an important '~ criminal case,**it ecause, 2n t ese criminal cases, it speaks in the name of the Constitution, the supreme law of the land. The manner in which it interprets that 1m., determines the scope of a criminal defendant T s rights and therefore affects every criminal trial in the country. Thanks to the Warren Court '. a criminal trial -nO\\~ takes, on the average, twice as long as it did in 1960, and this does not include the time consumed in appeals. The court systems, by which I mean the number of judges, prosecutors, court reporters, bailiffs, clerks and- .the;:.,,~, courtrooms themselves, were designed with the expectation that only ten percent of the defendants would plead not guilty and would, therefore, stand trial. But the proportion of 'guilty and nolo contendere pleas in the federal district: courts was only 78.7 percent in 1964 and has fallen steadily since then, until in 1971, it reached 61.7 percent.*** (And there is every reason to believe , * Harrison v.

Not C: (.\",(~surprisinglY, the rate of convictions has declined proportionately. '~~.,'\" lri~;:g reference to this situation, 'Chief Justice Burger, shortly after his appointment, said to the American Bar Association tha.t \"if ever the 1m-v is to have a genuine deterrent effect on criminal conduct, we must make some drastic changes.lI* The only change he recommended on that occasion \\vas the appointment of additional court personnel, but he has been instrumental in effecting others. Downum, for eX3.i1lple, has not been directly overruled, but its stature as a precedent was considerably reduced in 1973 when the Court, over the objections o...:g four holdovers from the l~arren Court era, refused to\u00b7 uphold a claim of double jeopardy in a case where, after the jury had been impaneled and sworn but before any evidence had been presented, the trial judge discovered a defect in the indictment that' could not be cured by amendment and declared a mis~.rial. \" The Co~rt held that jeopardy had not yet attac~~d and upheld the defenaant's conviction in a subsequent trial.** It has consistently refused to extend (and its critics insist that it hasundeJ:mined) the r'firanda j~, ' \\ rule concerning a suspect I s right to remain sili:mtJ. Hari1is v. New York involved a statement made to thepol:i,ce by a su-spect who had not been told. of his rights to coun~el and to remain silent. It was, therefore, inadmissible as evidence, but, because it was trustworthy according to prevailing legal standards, the Court pelillitted the prosecution to use it for impeachment * Chief Justice Warren C.

In one federal case, the prisoner petitioned for habeas corpus two years after his conviction and asked for a free transcript of his trial, which transcript, he alleged, would shaH that he had not had the assistance \"of effective counsel. A federal statute provides for free transcripts if the trial judge certifies that the asserte'd claim is not frivolous. The petitioner object,eq. to this provision, and the Court of Appeal agreed with him, but the Supreme Court reversed.** It is not impossible .-.~ . . that these and other recent decisions might make it easier for the criminal courts of the country to perform their primary function. The Supreme Court, however, has the p0\\1er to do more than pre- scribe the law; be,cause of the esteem in which it is held, it has the power. to influence prG\u00a3oundly what it is intellectually respectable to think about the problems that arise in the la\\Y. Thanks to the Burger Court, the day may come when it is once again respectable for judges and lawyers, as \\'lel1 as for criminologists) to advoc(tte that convicteccriminals be punished, and to admit that punishment has the capacity to deter crime. Whether this will have the desired effect on the crime and murder rates depends on factors still to be considered. *Harris v. New York, 401 U.S. 222 (1971). See also Michigan v.

The end was peace, and Beccaria's purpose was to show that in the enlightened commercial society crimes would be fewer and of a less violent character~ and that the punishmluts could he proportionately milder.

() -6- Why, indeed, should a person of sensibility, after \"glancing over. a code of \"loll-made laws and observirig that 'he has\" lost only a baneful liberty to injure others, \" then feel constrained \"to bless the throne and its occupant\" ....... in short, \\'/hy should he obey the sovereign's la\\'ls? Beccaria's anst'ler is that it is in his int:erest to do so, and not simply because it is'in his interest to avoid punishment The alternative to men's obeying the laws is the return \" :.;. to the state of nature wherein no man's rights are secure; and men can be taught to under$tand that. No \"enlightened person\" can fail to see hO\\'1 useful is the compact that provides 'mutual security\" and how necessary it is tha.t he~ and everyone else, obey the 1m-IS made possible by the compact. He \\'lillthen be constrained to :act \\1ith others as he \\'lants others to ,act with him, n4lt because he has been taught this as a moral duty,. but bec?t0<l the law has so commanded him and because it is in his interest to obey the law. Traditionally men had been taught that they lived under a moral law that not only forbade them to rob and assa~l t travellers on the road fl'om Jerusalem to Jericho but required them to follow the exampl~ of the good Samaritan and lend assistance to anyone who had been robbed and assaulted. 'The, familiar rule, do unto others as you would have others do unto you, summed it up. Hobbes' reformulation of this expr\u20ac.)sses the difference between traditional (;h:r:istian 'or POliCY2 and the nel'! natural rights not do that to another, tvhich thou ,.;ouldest not have done to thyself.\"* Under 'this regime, no one is taught .. l.' that h~\",must go to the assistan~e of travellers on the road to Jericho; 'one is only t:;ught that it ,'lin not be in his self-interest to be a thief or murderel\". Beccaria, like Hobbes, \\Vas confident that this system would work. ,,* Hobbes, Leviathan) I, ch.' 15. . ' ~7- . But is it men -' some wicke~ men-will see' . . immediately that their interests could best be advanced if others obey the maxim while they disobey it? Rousseau though~ 5:0, \\.,rhich is why he, long before objected to this Hobbean (a,nd soon to become Beccarian) system. He said that the wicked man would profit from the justman's \", probity and his own injustice.

'( While it is true tha\u00b7t the wicked man, along with everyone who/thinks about it, will want to avoid a return to the lawlessness of the state of nature, he will know that his disobedience alone will not cause such a return.' The conclusion from all this is that the fear of punishment will not work with, the fearless (Orlov)4 the irrational (Petrov), or the rational and wicked (whose names we are not likely to ~nm'l) ~ Some proportion;\"\" and perhaps' a considerable proportion -of this last group'might be deterred by the threat of t~~ly ruthless punishment summarily imposed. For example, the incidence of shoplifting \\.,rould probably shm.,r a marked decline if supermarket check-out clerks\\'lere authorized summarily (perhaps with small seal e guillotines conyenientlY located next to their cash registers)to chop off the hands of everyone apprehended in the act \" l' of stealing from the store. That is, it would show a marked decline if the ~. management\u00b7 could find check-out clerlcs who \\'lould inflict the penalty. J Whatever may be the case in Saudi Arabia, that is not likely to be possible in America. We can be fairly certain that such. a punishment could not be * Rousseau,Bnile, Book IV.

It was because he sa\\v the possibility of this that Beccaria was opposed to capitalpunishm~nt. }laving begun his chapter on the death penalty by demonstrating (tp his own. satisfaction, at least) that the sovereign has no right to impose the sentence of death on any citizen, Beccaria immediately contradicted himself by suggesting that the issue \\'ias not whether the sovereign had a xight to execute for crimes but whether there \\vere circumstances in which it was necessary to do so, and he conceded that there were. There are only t\\'lO possible motives for believing that the death of a citizen is necessary. The first: when it is evident that even if deprived of liberty he still has connections and power such as endanger the security of the nation\u00ad when, that is, hi's existence can produce a dangerous revolution in the established form of government. The death of a citizen thus becomes necessary when a nation is recovering or losing its liberty or, in times of anarchy\" when disorders themselves take the place of la\\vs.\u00b7 But \\\\Thile the laws reign tranquilly, in a fonn of government enjoying the consent of the entire nation, \\'/e11 defended externally and internally by force, and by opinion,' \\vhieh is perhaps even more efficacious than force, Hhere executive pO\\ .... er is lodged Hi th the true sovereign alone, lvhere riches purchase pleasures and not authority.

What foTTIl. of punishment ,,,as most fearful and, therefore, lvas best calculated to effect obedience to the lm'i's? The anS\\ver to this question turned on the sentiments of the population: ':, The 'death,penalty becomes for the majo:,rity a -. spectacle and for some others an object of, compassion mixed' 'l'Tith disdairi; these .tlVO sentiments rather than the salutary fear \\vhich the la\\'ls pretend to inspire occupy the spirits of the spectators. But in moderate and prolonged' punishments the dominant sentiment is the latter, because it is the only one. The iimit which the legislator ought to fix on the rigor of punishment:s Hould seem to be determined by the sentiment of compassion itself; when it begins to prevail over every other in the hearts of those \\vho are the witnesses of puniShment, inflicte,d for their sake rather than for the criminaf' s . ** -Punishment must fit the sentiments of 'the lalv-abiding popalation rather than the crime. It must be rigorous enough to strike fear in the hearts of that population, but not so rigorous that tha.t population sympathizes ''lith the criminal. -It must be rigorous enough to deter, but not so rigorous that ~J;le people refuse to allow it to' be imposed .. This. allows us to see that, t\u00b7J * Ibid., pp. 47, 49. ** Ibid., p. 47. '.' .u f) ,,\" except in barbaric\u00b7 places, shoplifting cannot in fact be deterred by a threat . . ,. to chop off the hands of those \\'Iho are caught. It also allm'l's us to see why tile death penalty may be regarded as the most d;readful penalty and, at the Saii1:1e time, why it may not deter the crimes for \\vhich it' is prescribed .. Pre\u00ad ,,, cisely because it is so dreadful, juries, their compassion aroused by the sight of the offender who faces death if convicted, may refuse to bring ill verdicts of guilty incases for which death is the mandatory punishment. Thus; to generalize, an excessively severe punishment will not serve to deter Orlov, Petrov, or anyone else, because it \\'lill not be imposed. But there is another' aspect to this subj ect as to 'l'ihich Beccaria was silent, perhap~ because it ~s an aspect that ca.Tl find no place in the deterrence theory of puniShment, Whether juries will in fact refuse to bring in verdicts of guilty in 'such circumstances depends not merely on their view of the penalty; it depends as \\.,rell on their attitude tm'lard the crime\u00b7 commi tted by 'the offender. The more heinous the crime, the less likely they are to feel compassion for the offender and the more likely they are to ovote for the most severe penalty permitted unde.!.\" the law. What this means ;1 is :~,that in imposing punishments the people ,'lill be guided not simply> or p.erhaps not even at al1, by considerations of \\'fhat is \u00b7required to strike fear in the hearts of the nonoffenders, but rather by their 110tions of what is deserved. The worse the crime, the heavier the penalty. This, of course, i~ the principle of just deserts, and among unsophisticated people there' seems to be what might be described as a natural tendency to adopt it. At any rate, a jury will naturally \"look back at 'the crime :rather-than forward tot!he effect of the punishment; ,,,hen looking back C!t the crime, it is likely to feel compassion for its victims rather than for 'its perpetrator. '. -11- In a murder case espec\"ially (so long as murder is, seen as' a terrible offense) ~ it is likely to feel compassion for the family and friends of the victim (as well as for the victim himself) 'and to want to assist them, even to the extent of satisfying their desire for retribution. In short, the jury that is permitted to look back at the crime is likely to become angry, both at the crime and the criminal- unless, of course, it has been taught 'to do otherl'lise. Beccaria's hope !'las that they could -be taught to do othe:tl'lise. \u00b7It shou~d be clear from his words on the subject that the principle of deterrence is incompatible with the principle of just deserts. This does not mean that punishments inflicted because the criminals deserve them may not serve to deter others from committing similar offenses; nor does it mean that a schedule of punishments devised in order to deter may not happen to correspond to one devised to make punishments fit the crimes. But deserved punishment is for the \"sake\"of the crime. and not for the sake. of the \" \",vi tnesses\" :0 as. aecc~ria put it ,or the nonoffenders. As such, it requires a looking back at the crime to determine what it deserves\" rather than a looking forward to determine whether it will dete),' others. It requires calculations that cannot be made by someone who holds that the purpose of punishment is only to prevent the criminal from inflicting ne\\'l injuries and \"to deter others from similar acts.\"* -The deterrence theorist will ,not recognize the victim of crimes or his anger; indeed, he. calls this anger a desire for revenge and his purpose is to offer no place in a schedule of' -, punishment$ for the desire for revenge, even if it goes by the name of retribution. Compassion for the victim does -not enter his calculations; the f( * Ibid. J p. 42. -12~ unly compassion he recognizes is that likely to be felt for the criminal.. lIe is not (at least in principle) an ~]lgry man, and his purpo'se is nOloJ, as \",\"/ \\'lith Beccaria, to teach the' law .... -and the judges and juries that administer the lau-not to be angry. Yet, a focus on deterrence instead 'of on the crime may have the paradoxical consequence of undermining . det'errence, or of limi~ing its effectiveness, not with the Orlovs and Petrovs-\" they are, in a sense, beyond the reach of the la\\oJ ~ but with the great bulk of the population who are amenable to instruction by the law. This is likely to be the consequence because the population will lose sight of the immorality of crime. The modern purpose of punishment is not to teach men that it is immoral to commit a crime, even the crime of murder, but that it is contrary '. I.l to their interests to do so. Hobbes is explicit on this point. The sovereign inay kill the subject, and the subject, whether guilty or innocent, may) to preserve himself,,'kiP the sovereign-:-or the sovereign's agents: jailer, executione~ or whoever aids them,and thereby threatens his li\u00a3e.* The sovereign acts with a vie\\oJ to his interest and the subj ect acts \\oJi th a vie\\y to his interest, and neither may impute blame to the other for so doing; and:e~ch, when he perceives his self-interest to require it, may kill the other. It might be said that a subject is \\oJrong to kill, because ''1hen he entered i~to the contract organizing civil society he agreed not to . kill, but he agreed not to kill o,nly because otherS also agreed and he calculated that this loJa;,s the most efficacious way to keep himself from being \\\\ killed. But if the law\"\"then decrees that he must die, he is absolved of his * Hobbes, Leviathan, II, ch. 21. \" , \" -13- contractlJal obligation not to kill.

Locke, one of the ,aqkno\\vlcdged founders of modern liberalism, put this 'bluntly: \"Everyone, as' he is' ~bound to preserve himself and 'not to quit his station wilfully, so by the like reason, when his 01'111 preservation comes not in c~nlpetition, ought he, as much as he can, to preserve the rest of mankind . \"* Not even murder is intrinsically immoral. It should be prevented, and it is the '\" function of penal laws to prevent it by demonstrating to everyone that it is 4t not in his interest to murder; but, quite obviously, when the sovereign show~ every intention of executin a a man, it is in the interest of that man to 0 kill his guards and escape. The question is, what is the effect of a system of law that says only that it is not in the interest of a man to commit a crime? Of a lalv that designs punishments lvith a view only to demonstrating to everyone tha.t it is not in his int,erest to commit a crime? Or, once again, of a lal'l that does not impute bla'lle to the crime committed by a man acting in what he . ., , perceives to be hjs mYn interests? is, there Ivill be more crime 4t C':i because once people are no longer governed by their morals-manners, as Rousseau put it, \"they will soon enough discover the secret of how to evade the lm'ls.\"** In short, deterrence will \\'iork only -if the threat of punishment is combined l'lith the conviction that the furbidden acts are not only illegal and therefore punishable but immoral. In the abs~nce of that conviction, the easily frightened \\dll not break the lm'1, but the fearless will break the lal'1, the ~rrational will break the law, and all the others will break the la\\.\" and the clever ones among them will do \"50 wi tn impunity. * Locke, Second Tre~tlse of Civil Government, ch. 2, sec. 6.

Crimine~ogy refers to. this educational capacity of the criminal law as general prevention,and under this label it is associated preeminently wi th the name of Johannes Andenaes, a NonTegian criminal lawyer. By general prevention he means the capacity of the criminal laH and its enforcement to promo.te obedience to lal.\" not by. instilling a fear of punishment, but rather by inculcating lm'i:-abiding habits. \"The. idea is disappro.val ef strengthen the public's moral code and thereby , . creates conscious and unconscious inhibitions against committing crimes.\"** Because he regarded this function of punishmEfIit, to be mere significant than: its capacity to instill fear, and because so little \\'las known of the mechanisms by which it w.orked, if it werked at all J he called for an *Engel v.

Yet1 it is possible that some part of that question can be ans\\.;ered. Xn the first place, it' seems clear that a system of so:\"called punishment, by which I mean punishment designed to rehabilitate the offender, is not likely to produce'the ,desired result. As I pointed out at the epd of the secpndchapter, this system has the pernicious effect pf capsing sympathy for the criminal. The.same objection can be made to a system of punishments designed solely to deter others f:rom committing crime; this, too, as I said earlier in this chapter, distrac'ts OUT attention from the crime, and this distrac- tion., makes it altogether too easy to feel compassion for, the criminal. , l\\That Andenaes wants to promote are habits by law-abidingness or habits of acting justly, and, the means by which that might be done must somehOif incorporate or recognize the justness of what is being done when lye punish.

( There seems to be an instinctive feeling in most ordinary men that a person who has done an injury to others should be punished for it .... Tt has, therefore, been pointed out that if the criminal law refuses to recognize retributive punishment then there is a danger that people will take the law into their own hands. A far greater danger, to my mind, is that without a sense of retribution we may lose our sense of '~rong. Retribution in punishment is an expression of the communi ty'\"s disapproval of crime, and if this retribution is not gi V'&l1 recognition then the disapproval may also disappear. \\\\~ community which is too ready to for.- give the wrongdoer may end by condoning the crime.* We have become accustomed to thinking of deterrence and retribution as independent or unrelated theories of puniShment, but Andenaes and Goodhart (and, of course, other \"old fashioned\" writers whom I have not men.tioned) are suggesting in this notion of general prevention that there is a point \\.;here they come together. We can recognise that point, of convergence by ---..., . adopting a very old manner of speaking, and say that the la\\~ works by praiSing, as 'well as by blaming. The law blames' \\~hen it prescribes punish- (., ntent, for certain acts and when it subjects those who commit those acts to punisl-l!1lent.

The mechanism by '~nich this praise is bestowed on the la\\.i-abiding'takes the form of sat,isfying some demand that springs from an aspect of their souls. What is satisfied _ is their anger. * A.,L. Goodhart, English Law and the Moral La\\.,. (London: be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the Lord, mercy shall compass him about .. .Be glad in'the Lord, an'd rejoice, ye righteous: a.nd shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart!\" (Psalms XXXII, 10-11). What is said here 93Jout the Lord must also be said about the 1m.;, and as belief in divine relvardand punishment declines, it must be said more ef.\\phatically about the law: we must trust in the \"i lal'l, and those who do ,yill be rewarded. The 1m.,; must respond to the deeas '. '. '. of the \\'licked, and the righteol}-s must have confidence that the law will respond, and do 59 in an appropriate manner. It must punish the wicked because the righteous Or law-abiding citize]fs make this 'demand of it. They are angered by the sight or presence of crime, and anger is not merely- a selfish passion. Roosevel t Gri er, the fdrmer New York Giants defensive linesman, and, the other friends of Robert Kennedy see him shot down before their eyes. They are shocked, then grief stricken, then angry; but California la\\-; cannot permit them.; to discharge that anger on its cause, Kennedy's -assassin; they must be restrained, \"and the appropriate way of restraining them is to assure them that it, the 1m .. , \\Vill respond to this crime. The law' must assuage that anger by satisfying it, but not, as Goodhart correctly says, simply to prevent them from taking the law into their own hands. Consider another example. A few years ago, a seven-year-old-boy \\vas ,~;rutally murdered on the lower East Side of Manhatten. The next day, in a nearby neighbourhood, a twenty-eight-year old girl ~yas stabbed to death in the\u00b7'.doorway to her, apartment. ,I The police caught the man suspected of doing it, and had a hard time protecting him from an angry crO\\yd of local . I I. I I I I I\u00b7 I I r -23-.',',; residents. A week later a thirty-one-year-old\u00b7man \\'las stabbed to deatfi by a burglar in his Ninth Avenue apartment (one of the ip<;:rea.sing number bf ~ \\~ felony murders), this before the eyes of his wife. The Times account continues as fo11m.,s: On the lower East Side, most residents seemed to agree with the police that the next time a murder suspect is',identified, Tuesday's mob scene is very likely to be repeated. There is a l'lidespread feeling that the police, the courts, the entire criminal justice system simply acts out a sort of charade~ and that it is up to the community to demand that justice is done. \"When the police find him, they'll just say he's a sick man and send him to a hospital, for t\\ofO years II ~ said .. a Delancey Street shopkeeper. \"Then he'll be right back on the street. The only thing to (\\0 is to kill this man right a\\vay, quickly and quietly.lI* . , , The la\\'1 must not allow that to happen, and not merely because the criminal may indeed be sick; it must provide the forms of justice in order to fulfill its educative function. ..... Robert Kennedy's friends \\vere angry; that East Side mob was angry; and it is not only right that they be angry (for murder is a terrible crime)~ but punishment depends on it and punishment is a way of promoting justice. Wi thout anger, or as And'enaes says in an e~;say \\'lri tten eighteen years original prevention, I.' 'vi thout moral indignation, \"punishment is inflicted only reluctantly.\"** Indeed, if a. society is truly indifferent to crime, punishment will not be inflicted at all. But a just society is one where everyone gets \\'1hat he deserves 2 and the, wicked deserve to be punished--:\" they deserve ''many sorrows\", as the Psalmist says -and the *'The'Neli Sunday, August of the WeekllJ,.:;IJ . 6. ** ~lorris (Ann Arbor: The University of'Michigan Press, 1974) ,\" p. 133.

It rewards ,.:the law-abid~,ng by satis:(:,ying the a71ger he feels at the sight of crime. It ~C\\\"ards, and by rewarding teaches, law-abidingness. 'Adam Smith said we feel cheated if a criminal shoufd die of a fever ' befo:re he is brought to ju~tice. * /, \"Cheat\" is, of course, the very verb ''fe use to describe this sort of thing, and while it is fashionable in liberal circles to deplore the usage and condemn the passion that gives rise to the sentiment, neither is reprehensible. We are deprived of something very valuable when a crimin<l:l escapes punishment, even if he does so by dying. I think, in fact, the ordinary person tends to react in the same Dlanner if a criminal is punished'before he is convictea. Consider the' ,case of Adolf Eichmann. As much as he lvash.ated by the Israelis, and, for that matter, by all decent men, they would have felt cheated if, lvhen he ,vas run down~ he had simply been gunned dOlm. He had to be brought to justice, and that could be done only by bringing him to trial, at considerable expense and not ,'lith out risk. Justice requires not only punishment, it ;requires the forms of justice; and the reason for this is that while the lat., might bla.\u00b7ne the crime by summarily punishing the criminal; it cannot praise \"ehe 1mv-abiding without providing the solemnities of a trial. There must be a trial, and it must b,e attended by all the dignity .. maj est)r, arid righteousness of the la\\o{.. in order to place an indelible stamp of justice on what is being done; only such a trial can fully justify the anger that demands punishment of the criminal.

Such a society is forbidden to teach righteousness as this is understood by any church or sect, but it may certainly use the offices of the criminal law to praise the opposite of what it may blame; that is, by recognizing the righ~ of the people to pay back those who rob, assault, or murder, for example\" or defraud, combine to restrain trade, file false tax returns;> or conspire to obstruct justice, for other examples, it may teach the rightness of not committing these !lreal crimes.\" The trial plays a necessary role in this educative function: in addition to justifying the people's anger~ it guarantees --or seeks to guarantee --that the people1s anger is directed, ), at the reprehensible act instead of tl'ie unpopular actor This> too, is <1,,\" I} if lesson that needs to taught, , \\\\ \",':-,~ , > ;0,\\ 3. Conci\\~sion In addition advocating that penalties not be p~escribed for \"im.aginary crimes\" but only for \"real crimes, It Hobbes and Becca1.\"ia also argued that the scale 0f punishments be determined solely ldth a vilBl'l to deterring the commission of these \"real crimes.\" Punishment WaS to be \" utilitarian in a very narrow sense. The question to be answered l'laS not, ''ihat punishm~nt is appropriate to this crime, or what punishment does this criminal deserve, but rather what degree of~~everity will deter others f:t'om '\\ 'I committing the same crime. The effect of' thi~\\\\.,as,~ ,as I have a~~ed above~\\ to distract our attention from the crime and th;~ irmnorali ty of crime , to \\ ' ,. '.' ~ , make it easy to forget the victims of crime, apd \\, sympathize \"Hh the . \\\\ . criminal. Paradoxically, it a'lso' makes 'it mOT.e difficult for punishment to do what it set out to do --namely, to deter crimes .. Only under tyrannical conditions ,dll the fear of punishment alone serve to 'prevent men from commi tting criminal acts. Punishment will promote la''1-abidingness, or serve the purpose of \"general prevention,\" only if it is seen to be deserved,' and it can be seen to be deserved only by a people that is capable of moral indignation at the sight of crime. I think the ordinary American is still capable of being morally indignant a{\\'. the sight of crime and criminals, but he has deTived no support for this from the intellectual community. On the contrary, the . . e~fort of criminologists, judges, \"law reformers,\" and the so-called intellectual press has been to deprive him of this anger by making him ash~led of it. In their book, he is su.pposed to feel compassion for the criminal .... . and to punish him only with the greatest reluctance -in the extreme case, to clasp him to his breast. This sentiment is not confined to America. Andenaes R:uotes a Norwegian judge as saying that. \"our grandfathers punished, '.J and they did so ,'Ii tr. a clear conscience [and] ''Ie puniSh too.. but we do it ,'lith a bad conscience. 11* But one can have a bad conscience for punishing, bad men only if one is corrupt, only if one has.lost all cOnfidence in the justice of the la\\~s or .the country .. or .. as I' said in the Introduction /;;:...-;' with ref~rence to the Israeli raid on the Entebbe airport, only if one has been deprived of moral strength.

Unfortunately, he gets no support for his moral judgments from the influential press.* '\" To conclude: there is no point in being angry wit~ the arlovs:. and 1.:< Petrovs among us. They. have to be imprisoned, but I doubt that a~ything beyond :their incapacitation is accomplished by imprisoning them. The law~. abiding person can derive little pleasure from seeing them punished. The la\\.,. can reward, and thereby teach, law-abidingness as it punishes crime only when those who commit the crime can be held responsible for it and~ therefore, can be held to deserve the punishment. And the arlovs and Petrovs are, to a large degree, irresponsible. Fortunately, most criminals are not arlovs or Petrovs, and some good might come from giving them what .they deserve. ,,:' * See, e. g., the revie'is in The NeN York Revie,.,. of Books and The Ne'''' York Times.

The Immorality of Abolition In l1is celebrated history of the ,criminal law of Eng'land, Sir James Fitzjrunes Stephen says that 'ucriminals should be hated [and] tha.t 'the punishments inflic.ted upon them should be so contrived as to give exp'ression to that hatred.\" It isa \"healthy natural sentiment,\" he says~ and, like the sexual passion, is deeply rooted in human nature. The ex- ecution of criminal justice~s the most el}lphatic of the forms in which \"deliberate and righteous disapprobation\" is expressed .. and stands. lito tae one set of passior-;Is in the same relation in which marriage stands to' . .~.. \\ : the oth~r.\"* Which is to say, these conventional institutions turn these- natural passions to. secially useful ends. Gabriel Tarde, the French jurist \\qho lvrote on criminal matters at the turn of the t\\ventieth century, was speaking to the same end in the following passage: (j ., . New so leng as man has absolute need ef.hating something. \\vould it not be a good thing for him to turn his hatred against crime and the criminal? , What bett.er can hatred accomplish than to take '.\\ itself fer its own object and its own sustenance? Is not the executien of an assassin in a way but to feel a hatred of hatred?** * Sir James Fitzjames Stephen ..

Men hated Presbyterian Convenantors and tied Margaret Maclachlan and Margaret Wilson to those stakes in the tidewaters of the Solway; they \" hated the other political party and sliced off Rumbold f s he,ad and dis- played it on a pike at the gates of Edinbu;rgh. When both Hobbes and Beccaria argued that vengeance should play no role in a proper system of punishments, they did so because they recognized only too tliel1 the terrible \\..-::-. things that can be done by men who hate -a,'ld \\'lho hate because they love. They attempted to solve the problem by detaching men from the objects of . th,eir love. One of these objects was God or the church of God. Anglo-Catholics hated Scotch Covenantors because they loved the Anglo-Catholic church,\u00b7'of 'God; they may have prayed for Christ's Church,,; II ,',;'/ ' ,j\"' 1/ they denied that the CoveIlantors were members of Christ's church. Hobbes's solution, which became the modern solution, ,.,as to persuade men to \\'lOrry about their bodies more than their soul s, . in fact, to worry about ,-::', their bodies because that is all they were. Men \\-:ho devote themselves to preserving~t'h.eir bodies and leading comfortable lives are much less' likely ta love -and hate . Men can also love their countries and; to the\" extent that they do, hate foreigners .tl This pro';'ide~ a fertile ground for\\'lar5 in which glory, may be won but in which bodies may be killed.

Love of country is>to be superseded by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Nen can also love themselves and hate those who do not recognize their merit which is,easily transformed in their own minds into their supE'<.riority; but Hobbes teaches that this pride or vanity is illusory,' that o . .. . all meit are equally contemptible, that what all men seek is nothing but pot.,rer;. that their anger is simply selfish, that \"the ~'iorth of a man, is as of all other things, his price/'* and that the Leviathan (the \"King over all the children of pride\" [Job, XLI, 34]) should keep them in their places; by making them fear death more than they love glory or superiority. '-j ',) Hobbes also taught 'men actively to seek the goods of the body, \\\\ l'inich are less likely than ''ihat are thought to be the goods of the soul , . to, give rise to love and hate; or, at least, are less likely to do so once the problem of scaX'ci ty is overcome. Then all men can share in the goods produced by an ever-expanding G:z;-oss National Product. His sUccessors in this re::;pect, John Locke a~d Adam Smith, showed hmv it could be solved; they showed hm'/ the GNP (originally called The Weal th of Nations) c01l1d be multiplied by a factor of ten, a hundred, a thousand, or even, as Locke finally leaves it, tp such an extent as to make nature's original bequest appear \"almost l'iOrthless. 11* They ,.\"era, as we have every reason to know, right; and they and Hobbes ,.\"ere essentially right in tlJe consequences of this emphRsis on the goods of the body: men who pursue material self-interest *Leviathan, I, 'ch. 10.;,\" .

The relatiens ameng them can be expressed centractually and measured in meney. Rather than seek vengeance er fight duel~. for injuries suffered or in suI ts received, men will new file suits asking for compensai:.ion fo.r contracts breached or reputations defamed. The primary contract~- the , '[ contract that makes passible all ethers.-.. is, af course, the sac~~al con.., tract, according to which men agree to yieHl their natural freed<~m to the sovereign in exchange for his premise to. keep the peace, and! it is :1 [' net strange that in time it ll'Ould eccur to. peaple to. make the sqlvereign nanperfarmance tao..

The insu!ance policy takes the place of law enforcement and the posse comitatus, and John Wayne and Gary. Cooper give way to Mutual af Omaha. In principle, the \\'lOrth of a man being his price, ther(:l is no. reason why coverage cannot be extended to the losses incurred in a.murder. It is an almost perfect solution to the crime problem. A peop~e that has been deprived of its moral indignation cannat deter crime through punisocc.nt, but a people that is fully covered oy in$.urance has no need to \" \\'i deter crime. We can expect c],'l.me to. incr\u20ac(ase, of co'urse,;,and thistdll II . \" II increase the premiums\",\u20ac! pay ,/' direct~y 'or-in .the .form of\u00b7 taxes ; but it \\'li11 no longer be necessary to apprehend,,, try and imprison crimina.ls, , I \". ~ I. , if . . which is nOl'l costing us .. more than a bilHon dollar$ a month (e~cluding the U . o \" . II 'tj ,< \"'l'J ,.\".: -5- cost of the federal government's criminal justice activities),* and one can \\. buy a lot of insurance fora billion dollars a month. Only one thing pre- vents this from being a perfect or final solution to the crime problem: there continue to be people who look upon criminals as immoral and de- serving ofpunishmentj people who continue to hate because they continue to 10v.e\". or to have attachments that cannot be measured in money; passionate people .who must be the despair of the Menningers and Wickers; unsophisticated people \\'fho favor capital punishment, not necessarily because they think it serves to deter murder, for example, but because they hate murderers and think they have forfeited the right to live. Perhaps what best characterizes such'people (and they probably . ' constitute a majority of Americans, even today) is their opinion that their relations one \\.,rith another are governed by a laTlJ in addition to r:(,} t.he laws\" that' are~'inscribed in the statute books, or that together they '\"\", constitute some sort of a community tha:;: cannot be described adequately \\\\ in terms only of contractual partnership~. It is this belief in the reality of a moral lal'l that, when'this law is violated, give~ rise to moral ind,ignation. To s\\lch men, crime is more than' crime, more than an eventcoverable by insurance; crime is a denial or a violation of that wJrich COT4stitutes a cornrnun~ty among men and distinguishes them from all '\", -~ f-\u00b7\u00b7~\"0.. ~. otli\"er cr~atu;res.

And it is from the moral community that the perpetrators 'of terrible 'crimes are banished -if necessary, by being executed. \" This is what the death penalty means to the unsophisticated person: a form of banishment from the moral community, imposed on those who have violated what the community understands to be the most solemn and awful of its comman~~ents. Albert Camus, perhaps the most thoughtful of the aboli~ionists, understood this very well, and called for the abolition of the death penalty precisely because he denied, the possib!li ty of the moral community, the only community that might justly impo$e it on anyone. His most sf celebrated novel, L'Etranger (variously translated as The Stranger or The Outsider), is, a brilliant portrayal of what constitutes heroism in a ,. purposeless ''lorld, a world deprived of God, as he puts it. * VEtranger is a modern masterpiece. and is generally ackno:'lledged to be so, and its hero, Meursault (\\~'ho, interestingly enough, is a murderer), is widely , . \" acknm'l'ledged'to be a h\u20acn,',o; but L'Etranger is also a very innnoral book. Meursault is the stranger,or outsider because he neither 10v~s nor hates,nor understands ,.\"hat other people mean when they speak of love o'r seek to attach them;:;oei~~s to other human beings. His mother'S' death ,c'J and funeral, which ,open the novel, leave him unmoved. Whatever he does, ,/''''~''I he does, like any other animal, out of natural necessity: he eats, 1t * and 'dtho~t savoring his food; he has an apartment, but only because he needs shelter of some sort (and he moves all the items necessary i6 his existence into one room 'to save the trouble of cleaning the others); he takes a \\'loman the same \\'lay he takes a meal, and just' ds he must shop for hi.s food~ he is \\'lilling to marry the woman if she insists on this . \"-; ceremony -in fact, as he concedes, he is Willing to marry anyone whose body satisfies. his body's needs. Marriage is not a serious matter, he says. Nothing is serious. TIle world he inhabits is differentiated by night and ...../;::'~~\\, heat and cold (and he enjoys SHimming '<lhen the . beauty r' ~ -:::::::-- o-r ugliness, justice or injustice, war or peace.

He then says that he thinks the magistrate did not understand him. Up ~o this P9int, Camus' is a terrible indictment br:Llliantly achieved, an indictment of Hobbean man seen not in the\" state of nature or upon his first bursting onto the stage of historY-ft Meursault is neither brute nor the vulgar \"bourgeois gentleman\" of MOliere's play-but seen at the end of history, so to speak. Here he is body-preserving man deprived not only .of his dr~ams of heaven and glory, friendship and justice) but . even of his avarice; he is the man wha \\'lants nothing and, as \\<1e shall see soon enough, fears only death. One can ,understand why his sometimes friend, Jean-Paul- Sartre, likened Camus to the Fren~h moralists of the seventeenth century. Then abruptlY, Camus' perspectivn changes, or he makes us see wha',: perhaps we ought to have seen all along: Mem:sault is an \"oL1tsider\" not because he i5 an inhuman man in a human \\'lorId, but\u00b7 becaus6 he is the only honest man in a world of hypocrites. Healone -;;.? -::::::::----;..~:::---' understands that the universe prov~des no sllipport for what men in their ignorance persist in regarding as the human things, say, love and justice. o And in the end Camus asks the reader (and apparently succeeds\", wi th most) ': .to iden1;:ify with that man., As he 'o/rote in his notebook in answer to a c critical revie\\'l of the b09k, \"therei5 no othe;-life possible for a rna,:,. deprived of God; and all men aTe .in that position. n* I Ii * is ailed and spends some months awaiting trial, during . which time he ~s frequently interrogated by his la\\'lyer and the examining magistrate.

Now he was able tO,accept the truth by which he had lived: that the universe is \"benignly indifferent\" to hm'( he or :;:.\\ anyone else lives. Of course, the law is not indifferent to h01'1 he lived- for example, the law forbade him to commit murder-but the law' is simply a collect~'On of arbitrary conceits; other people 1Ye-re not indifferent to liow he lived-for example~ they expressed dismay at his lack of attachment \\) to his mother -Lut other people are hypocrites.

The plots of Shakespeare's tragedies involve political men -Caesar the emperor, Coriolanus the general, Lear the king, Hamlet the son-of a king, and others, including, of course, Macbeth who would be king-and this is ,not fOJituitous, any more than it represents the prejudices of a poet \\'iho liv.ed in an aristocratic age. He chose to \\'iriteabout such men because the moral problems can be made fully' intelligible only in what they do or do not, do and in the \" '\" consequ\u00a2nces of \\lIhat th~y do or do. not do .

Macbeth was such a man, and in his fal1~ brought' -about by his o\\m acts, and in the. consequent suffering he endured, is revealed the meaning of morality. In Nacbe-th the maj esty of the moral 1a\\q is demonstrated to us by the fact that even a great man cannot preva.:U against it. fn'<R~similar 'fashion, the punishments imposed py the legal order remind :us of the reign of the moral order; not only do they remind us of i't, but by enforcing its prescriptions> they enhance the dignity of the legal order in the eyes of moral men. That is especially important, in a 'self-governing community, a community that gives la''ls to itself. That the American legal order must., in t!'te eyes' of its citizens .. have this dignity is the substance of Madison's argument in the 49th Federalist.

Like Duncan in the opini~lf of Macduff .. they ,wuld be \"the Lord's annointed,\" and they \\'lould be obeyed even as lv1acduff obeyed the laws of the Scottish kingdom.

This is also \\'ihy the statutes upheld in 1976 were so carefully drafted. ** All three, and ~specially the Georgia law, embody procedures intended to impress on judges and juries the gravity of the judgment they are asked to make in capital cases; for example, all three require the sentencing decision to be separated from the decision respecting guilt or innocence; and, in one \\Yay o:r j~TlotJler\u00b7~ all three. imply * W'oodson v. 96 S.Ct.2978; Roberts'V.

Finally, all three statutes permit or . require an expedited appeal to or revie\\v by their respective supreme courJcs, ,which are authorized to set aside a death sentence in order ~o ensure, for example, that similar results are reached in similar cases. (That this review is not perfunctory is indicated in the fact that the Florida Supreme Court had~ at the time of the United States Supreme Court decisions, 'vacated eight of' the twenty-one sentences to .. come before it under the ne\\'1 1m.;. *) It is an a\\'1esome power that is also abused when it is used dis- criminatori1y, and Justice Douglas voted to vacate the sentences in. the 1972 cases because it appeared obvious to him that death sentences have * Proffitt v.

' .been imposed and carried out disproportionately \"on the 'po()r,\\l the Negro, and the members of unpopular groups. \"* 'There is surely some truth' in this, and the Chief Justice acknowledged it in his dissent in 1972 when he said that \"statistics suggest, at least as a historical matter, that Negroes have been sentenced to death/with greater frequeJ1cY ,I than \\'ihites in several states, particularly for the crime of.interracial rape.\"** That, of course, is one reason why the Court has insisted that Negroes no longer be systematically excluded from jury service; and that is al,so why, in its new statute, Georgia authorized its supreme court to set aside any death sentence that appeared to ,be the 1'esul t of passion or prejudice on the part of trial judge or jury. This could prove to be an indication of an important change where it is most needed, because, in the period fTom, 1930 through 1974\" Georgia executed 366 of the 3,859 . ~\" persons executed in the ~ntire country, more than any other state, and of the Georgia total, 298 were blacks.*** In themselves these statistics indicate only that the number of blacks executed is disproportionate to the:;'\u00b7;' number of blacks in the population and not to the number of crimes committed l, \" by blacks.

That is what it amounts to~ as the statistic on the proportion of black victims implies. This is simply another version of the familiar southern practice of sentencing the black rapist of a white () ''loman t:o death and the black rapist of a black ''lOman to a short term in \" prison. We have had too much of this sort of thing. ,\\ It is, finally, an a\\'1esome pO\\'1~r that is abused llfhen it is used too often, and historically it has been used too often, no'~ only by religious states against opposing religious sectarians, but also, by stat~s that :\\ apparently knew no other ''lay to deal with their crimin~l elements.

But '. -39- . . except for the most awful crimes, * the death prjnalty is unjust~. Justice requires the punishment to fit the crime, \",shieh requires a'schedule of pun~shments, ranging from the most lenient t.hrough various degrees of severity to the most awful, death, because the moral sentiments of a just people recognize that crimes range from the. most petty through various degrees of gravity to the most awful, the taking oia human life. The law cannot reinforce those moral sent'iments (Gmd its purpose is to do just that) if it executes the pickpocket 0:1': the shoplifter' a.s well as the murdere:r; to do that is to equate petty theft with murder, and petty amounts of property with a human life. The lal'l that does that ''lill lose the respect it must enjoy among the people, tvho Hill neither obey it nor, '''hen serving on juries, enforce it: The movement to abolish capit:al punishment was ill.'...conce;1.ved because its purpose \\'la.s to prevent the people. from expressing their moral opinion of the pu~ishment deserved by terrib~e criminalsj for the same reason, a mandatory death sentence statute is also ill-c~nceived. Such a statute ,'lill either not be enforced among us or, if somehow it were to be enforced /against the opinion of the people, the effect would be to arouse their compassion for the persoll executed, and that compassion would not be offset by the sense that he desenfed what he got. Which is to say that in the moral sense of the people are to be fou~d both the upper and the '. 10\\'1er limits on the number of executions; bl,lt that moral sense has to be carefuHy cultivated by the law. That moral sense gives rise to anger at the sight of crime, Cl.nd anger can be an ugly passion; \\VhE!n it it deforms or misshapes '\" My O\\ffi vie\\i is that the death penalty is deserved by some Il)J-.rrderers as well as by traitors and men guilty of some' especially horrible rapes. o -------- ----~------------------------ -40.., the countenance, making it ugly. Whatever its obj ect, anger is all-lays . self-righteous. (And \\I[ho among us is truly righteous?)

It is the cause of many terrible acts~ lynchings1 for example. Yet is also the cause of many heroic acts committed in the best and nobles't of causes, which should serve to remind us that the ;j objects or causes that provoke or inspire it are not alike. There is a moral 'difference bet\\l[een a lynch mob and a John Brown; but just as Jo1m. Brmm's cause required an Abraham Lincoln to bring it to a just conclusion\" so the lynch mob's cause requires the offices of the la,1[ to ta1l1e it. The moral sense that should describe the upper limits on the 11,umber of executions must .... not be that which manifests itself in the initial anger. As I said in the previous chapter, it is the function of the' law' to tame the people's anger by satisfyi;ng it and therebY justifying it. J II The anger felt on behalf of the victims of crime, as well as on behalf of the moral order constituting the community, is not, as I argued, simply selfish and is not reprehensible. But that anger has to ~e t;~II1ed also in the sense of being calmed, or moderated. 'A., proper c~ijninal trial achieves , ,,\\- this by forcing the jury to determine, beyond a reasonable doubt that the,Co accused is guilty as charged, and the nell[ death penalty statutes' go further by impres.\u00a7ing upon the jurY)that death is not the ordina.:r.y'punishment even f ,:':,\" for those convicted of a capital crime. In order further to calm ,that.' . . o a~ger, I think it proper to insist that executions be public. That, I think, () \" ;. I 11 () '.

It il'-~,\\ coul.d be a truly a''le inspiring occasion, whiclt is what it should be ,~ , \" if it'is to serve its legitimate purpose . There are obvious objections to public executions, even when they are ~ot 'the sort of spectacle t;hat Mandeville was describing in the eighteenth century. * No one can be required to ''litness them, and it J \" would be better if some people riot be permitted to witness them- !\"chndr~n, for ~Eample, and the sort if permitted, . . .-..../ '~happilY join a lynch mob.

Conclusion, ,When abolitionists speaK of the barbarity of capital punishment and when Supreme Court justices denounce expatriation in almost identical lang-uage, they ought to be'reminded that men whose moral sensitivity they would not question have' supported both punishments. Lincoln .. for example~ albeit with the greatest reluctance, allOlved some deserters to be shot and ordered the \"Copperhead!! ClementL. Vallandigham banished; and it w,as ShakesP!=lare's sensitivity to the moral'~issuetJHit required him to have \"\"'\" Macbeth killed. They shOUld also be given some pause by the .knm'iledge, that\u00b7the man who originated the opposition to both capital and exilic, punishment; Cesare Beccaria, was a man whc argt~,ed that there was no morality \\' outside the positive lal,f: and that it is reasonable to love one\"' s property more than one's country. There is nothing exalted in those' opinions .. '::j . . and there is nothing of the'll! that 8.flpear in today's . . I judicial opinions. Capital punishment is said,to be a denfal of human dignity, but in order to re'ach this conclusion Justice Brennan had to reduce\"\"\" human dignity to the point where it be'came, lit'~raliy, ~.(.: being possessed said to , deprivec::a\",man, his to hav,e rights J and everyone\u00b7;,,\u00b7tl,~ lIiatter what ,,\"I does; is entitled to the right to have rights. In order to appreciate the severity of these punishments to the point wher~ they could be called cruEf.l and unusual,it was necessary to, lower the standards against which human' actions are to be judged, and the consequence of this is a depreciation of the gravity of the offenses for which these punishments are imposed, To say that Macbeth does not deserve to be killed is implicitly to ,,) say that 'his crimes 'Were not terrible; and that judgment can rest only on ,a debased standard of right and w;rong, a standa:rd commensurate with the proposition that Macbeth still possessed human dignity. Shakespeare ;) . disagreed. To say that Meursault does not deserve to be executc:i is to reveal a c0r-rupted moral judgment, and the jacket of the Penguin edition of The Outsider provides an illuminating example of such a judgment: .... '\u00b7But he fMeursaul t] has a glaring fault in the eyes of, society -he seems to lack the basic emotions and reactions (including hypocrisy) that are required of him. He observes the facts of life, death, and sex from the outside. Even when he is involved in a personal tragedy which results in a frightening and unjust trial, he considers his Olm feelings and actions of others with a'calm and almost ironic truthfulness. WHat.i.s referred to here as a \"personal tragedy\" was, of course, a senseless murder, artd l'lhat is called a \"frightening and unju'st trial\" was, in fact a trial fair by any decent standard. That the,' author of this statement (some' anonymous editor, no doubt) should not see this shows the corrupting influence of the book. Camus's art causes him to sympathize with Meursault, , who murdered a man and , .. ho admitted that he had murdered a man.

Meursault acquires a kind of dignity; according to Camus himself, he acquires the only'kind of dignity our world has to offer. But it is not a dignity we can live .' with, and Camus admitted that too. \"Society,\" he said, \"neeCls people who weep at their mothers I funerals.
