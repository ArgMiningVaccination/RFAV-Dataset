I remember hearing Bill Johnson in the 1990's talk about his ministry counseling plan. If someone would ask to see him for pastoral counseling, he would say, \"Yes, I can meet with you, but before we meet, I would like to prescribe to you megadoses of connection with God and His Word.\" So, those people would spend extra time in prayer, the Bible, worship, etc., and after doing so, many of them did not need to meet with Bill as they originally thought. Their problem was not circumstantial or emotional, but it was a spiritual disconnection from the Lord. When that was remedied, they were able to get a breakthrough and see their circumstances and themselves differently. Much of our spiritual weakness, emotional instability, frustration, dissatisfaction, and shallowness of spirit is caused by spiritual malnutrition. Once we get back \"plugged into\" the Lord, the fruit of the Spirit will naturally happen. \"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law\" (Galatians 5:22-23). Are you thinking you are far away from peace and confidence? It is very possible all you need is to take a megadose of spiritual intake. Here are some ideas of what that could look like: Bible intake - A good dose of Psalms, the Gospels, Galatians, Ephesians, Isaiah chapters 40-66, Romans, and the Book of Acts will especially do wonders. Prayer - Whether it is an increase in your secret place time with the Lord, crying out for more of Him, praying through the Bible, or \"soaking\" silently in His presence with worship music playing, prayer is so powerful. Deep fellowship - Isolation creates spiritual problems, but strong connections with other believers helps propel us into spiritual vitality. \"But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin\" (1 John 1:7). Worship - When we passionately listen to and sing our favorite worship songs, our heart can connect to God intimately and help melt away any coldness in our spirit. Steve Backlund maybe you could add something here about the power of the things we declare in songs that we might not declare otherwise Declarations - \"Faith comes by hearing\" (Romans 10:17). Speaking an abundance of these faith statements is a great way to encourage ourselves and get out of the doldrums. Which of these stands out to you to increase now? Who can help you be consistent in this? One more question: What could you fast to help this megadose have a greater effect? Here are some ideas: Finally, I suggest megadoses of laughter as well. \"A merry heart is good medicine\" (Proverbs 17:22). How about ending your day with a dose of watching a funny cat video? It will increase your laughter and decrease your stress. About Us Steve Backlund is a prolific encourager, catalytic author, joy activator, and revivalist teacher.
