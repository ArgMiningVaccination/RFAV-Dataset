In contrast to conventional vaccines, which can have an extended lead development time, rapid-response vaccines are quickly developed and easy to scale up and deploy. Recognizing the need for improved technology for emergency vaccines, and in response to the swine coronavirus (porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV)) outbreak in the U.S. in 2014, we have developed novel first and next-generation methods for rapid response vaccine development. Complementary efforts are targeted toward improving the stability and delivery of rapid-response vaccines to stimulate strong maternal immunity and the passive transfer of antibodies via milk to protect against neonatal infection.
