Medical detoxification, or medical detox, is the first step in recovery from drug or alcohol addiction to safely manage withdrawal symptoms in individuals who have become physically dependent on a substance. Withdrawal from drugs or alcohol can be life-threatening if not properly supervised by professionals. That's why Clear offers a medically supervised detox that provides individualized treatment and around-the-clock care. Upon intake, clients meet with a physician who conducts a comprehensive evaluation and designs an individualized detoxification protocol using medication-assisted therapy. Our attending physician, alongside a team of nurses, licensed clinicians, and certified counselors, closely monitor each client to ensure comfort and safety during the detox process in a private and intimate residential setting. Our team is committed to compassionate and individualized care with a sensitivity to the physical and emotional needs that arise during detox.
