These blood vessels are called the coronary arteries. A coronary artery stent is a small, metal mesh tube that expands inside a coronary artery. If you have a blocked artery in your heart, legs, or neck, you may need a stent to keep your blood flowing to prevent serious problems. Let's talk today about stents. A stent is a tiny tube we place in an artery, blood vessel, or other duct (such as the one that carries urine) to hold the tubes open. A stent is left in permanently. Most stents are made of metal or plastic mesh-like material. Stent grafts made of fabric are often used in larger arteries. Stents are used to treat a variety of artery and other problems. Your doctor will make a small cut in a blood vessel in your groin and thread a thin, flexible tube called a catheter to the place in your body where you need a stent. In the heart, a fatty substance called plaque can build up inside the coronary arteries. Plaque narrows the arteries, reducing the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the heart. One stent, called an intraluminal coronary artery stent, is a small, self-expanding, metal mesh-like tube that is placed inside a coronary artery after balloon angiography. This stent prevents the artery from re-closing. Another stent is coated with medicine that helps further prevent an artery from re-closing. In the carotid arteries, which are on both sides of your neck, plaque can build up and slow the flow of blood to your brain. Stents can keep the carotid arteries open. Stents can also open up narrow arteries in your legs caused by peripheral arterial disease. They're also used to treat an abdominal aortic aneurysm, which is when the large blood vessel that supplies blood to your abdomen, pelvis, and legs becomes abnormally large and balloons. After a stent procedure, your doctor will probably recommend that you take aspirin and another anti-clotting medication to prevent blood clots from forming in the stent. Make sure that you talk to your doctor, before getting a stent, about the risks associated with placing a stent to treat your condition, such as tissue growing around the area where the stent was placed. When You're in the Hospital You had angioplasty when you were in the hospital. You may have also had a stent placed. Both of these were done to open narrowed or blocked coronary arteries, the blood vessels that supply blood to your heart. You may have had a [heart attack](/health-library/diseases-conditions/heart-attack) or [angina](/health-library/diseases-conditions/angina) (chest pain) before the procedure. What to Expect at Home You may have pain in your groin area, arm, or wrist. This is from the catheter (flexible tube) that was inserted to do the procedure. You may also have some bruising around and below the incision. The chest pain and shortness of breath you likely had before the procedure should be much better now. Self-care In general, people who have angioplasty can walk around within 6 hours after the procedure. You may be able to be up and walking earlier if the procedure was performed through the wrist. Complete recovery takes a week or less. Keep the area where the catheter was inserted dry for 24 to 48 hours. If the provider put the catheter in through your groin: - Walking short distances on a flat surface is OK. Limit going up and down stairs to around 2 times a day for the first 2 to 3 days. - Don't do yard work, drive, squat, carry heavy objects, or play sports for at least 2 days, or until your health care provider tells you it is safe. If the provider put the catheter in your arm or wrist: - Don't lift anything heavier than 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) (a little more than a gallon of milk) with the arm that had the catheter. - Don't do any heavy pushing, pulling or twisting with that arm. For a catheter in your groin, arm, or wrist: - Avoid sexual activity for 2 to 5 days. Ask your provider when it will be OK to start again. - Don't take a bath or swim for the first week. You may take showers, but make sure the area where the catheter was inserted does not get wet for the first 24 to 48 hours. - You should be able to return to work in 2 to 3 days if you do not do heavy work. You will need to care for your incision. - Your provider will tell you how often to change your dressing. - If your incision bleeds or swells up, lie down and put pressure on it for 30 minutes. Angioplasty does not cure the cause of the blockage in your arteries. Your arteries may become narrow again. Eat a heart-healthy diet, exercise, stop smoking (if you smoke), and reduce stress to help lower your chances of having a blocked artery again. Your provider may give you medicine to help lower your cholesterol. Most people take [aspirin](/health-library/selfcare-instructions/aspirin-and-heart-disease) together with another antiplatelet medicine such as [clopidogrel](/health-library/selfcare-instructions/clopidogrel-plavix) (Plavix), prasugrel (Efient), or ticagrelor (Brilinta) after this procedure. These medicines are blood thinners. They keep your blood from forming clots in your arteries and stent. A blood clot can lead to a heart attack. Take the medicines exactly as your provider tells you. Do not stop taking them without talking with your provider first. You should know how to [take care of your angina](/health-library/selfcare-instructions/angina-when-you-have-chest-pain) if it returns. Make sure you have a follow-up appointment scheduled with your heart care provider (cardiologist). Your provider may refer you to a cardiac rehabilitation program. This will help you learn how to [slowly increase your exercise](/health-library/discharge-instructions/angina-discharge). You will also learn how to [take care of your angina](/health-library/discharge-instructions/angina-discharge) and [care for yourself after a heart attack](/health-library/discharge-instructions/heart-attack-discharge). When to Call the Doctor Contact your provider if: - There is bleeding at the catheter insertion site that does not stop when you apply pressure. - There is swelling at the catheter site. - Your leg or arm below where the catheter was inserted changes color, becomes cool to touch, or is numb. - The small incision for your catheter becomes red or painful, or yellow or green discharge is draining from it. - You have chest pain or shortness of breath that does not go away with rest. - Your pulse feels irregular -- very slow (fewer than 60 beats), or very fast (over 100 to 120 beats) a minute. - You have dizziness, fainting, or you are very tired. - You are coughing up blood or yellow or green mucus. - You have problems taking any of your heart medicines. - You have chills or a fever over 101\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C).
