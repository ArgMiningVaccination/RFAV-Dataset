[Autism](https://www.eliteayurveda.com/diseases/psychological/autism/) isn't a disease. Being autistic does not imply that you have a disorder or illness. It means that your brain functions differently than other people's. It's either something you're born with or something that shows up when you're young. If you're autistic, you'll be that way for the rest of your life. Autism isn't a medical condition that can be treated or cured. However, certain people need assistance with specific tasks. Autistic people are capable of living a complete and active life. Being autistic does not have to prevent you from living a fulfilling life. Autistic people, like everyone else, have things they excel at and things they struggle with. Being autistic does not rule out the possibility of making friends, forming relationships, or finding work. However, you may need additional assistance with these matters. What is autism spectrum disorder? Everyone's experience with autism is unique. Autism is classified as a spectrum disorder. This means that any person with autism is unique. Few autistic people need little or no assistance. Others may need daily assistance from a parent or caregiver. Some people refer to autism by other terms, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) - this is the medical term for autism. autism spectrum disorder (ASC) - some people use this term instead of ASD. Asperger's (or Asperger syndrome) - a term used by some to identify autistic individuals of normal or above-average intelligence. What causes autism? Autism is also followed by sensory sensitivities and medical problems like gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, seizures, or sleep disorders, as well as mental health issues like anxiety, depression, and attention issues. Autism is caused by a variety of factors, as we all know. There is no single cause of autism spectrum disorder. There are likely multiple reasons, given the disorder's complexities and the fact that signs and severity differ. Autism can be caused by a combination of genetic and non-genetic or environmental causes, according to research. - Genetics: Autism spectrum disorder is thought to be caused by a number of different genes. A genetic disorder, such as Rett syndrome or fragile X syndrome, may be linked to autism spectrum disorder in certain infants. Some children may be more susceptible to autism spectrum disorder due to genetic variations (mutations). Other genes may influence brain development or the communication between brain cells, or they may influence the severity of symptoms. Some genetic mutations appear to be hereditary, while others appear to appear out of nowhere. - Non Genetic or Environmental factors: Researchers are currently investigating whether viral infections, drugs or pregnancy complications or air pollution play a role in the onset of autism spectrum disorder. These factors tend to boost a child's chances of developing autism. Note: However, that increased risk does not imply causation. Any autism-related gene variations, for example, can be observed in individuals who do not have the condition. Similarly, not everyone who is exposed to an autism risk factor can develop the condition. In reality, the vast majority of people would refuse. Risk Factors Increased risk - Advanced age of the parent (either parent). - Complications during pregnancy and birth (e.g. extreme prematurity [before 26 weeks], low birth weight, multiple pregnancies [twin, triplet, etc.]). - The pregnancy was less than a year apart. Decreased risk Prenatal supplements containing folic acid, before and after birth. No effect on risk. Vaccines. Each family has particular expertise in diagnosing autism which, for others, leads to the timing of their child's vaccines. Around the same time, scientists have undertaken substantial studies over the past two decades to establish if there is a correlation between infancy and autism vaccines. The findings of this study are clear: Autism is not triggered by: - Poor parenting - Vaccinations, such as the MMR vaccine - poor nutrition - A contagious infection Learning disability and Autism Autistic individuals may be of any intelligence class. Some autistic individuals have intelligence that is normal or above average. A learning disability/disorder affects some autistic people. This means they will struggle to care for themselves and need assistance with daily tasks. Autistic people can suffer from a variety of ailments. Autistic individuals also suffer from co-occurring disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or dyslexia depression or anxiety epilepsy is a form of epilepsy. What are the behaviors of autism? Autistic people can behave differently than others. Autistic people's behaviors change frequently. They may struggle to communicate and connect with others; they may struggle to understand how others think or feel; they may find things like bright lights or loud noises overwhelming, stressful, or uncomfortable; they may become nervous or frustrated in new environments or social situations; they may take longer to understand information; they may repeat actions or thoughts.
