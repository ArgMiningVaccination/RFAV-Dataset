[Naturopathic Medicine is great for improving fertility naturally.](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/infertility/naturopathic-approach-to-infertility.html) Naturopathic medicine focuses on the why you are not getting pregnant, rather than labeling you with [Infertility](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/infertility/toronto-fertility-program.html). As a [Naturopathic Doctor](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/meet-our-therapists.html), my initial focus for fertility treatments is to get to the the why you are not getting pregnant. Some of the things that can effect fertility include, and are not limited to: 1. Diet - Diet has one of the biggest roles to play when it comes to fertility. Shocked? Don't be. For people who consume dairy and meat products of a fairly regular basis, estrogen hormone levels will be effected especially if the meat and dairy are not organic. Cows and chicken pumped full of hormones and antibiotics, which can eventually end up in your body, especially if you consume high amounts of meat and dairy products. High estrogen levels in the body will cause various irregularities in the menstrual cycle and PMS symptoms, as well, effect the amount of testosterone in males. Soy is another product that can effect fertility as well. Soy products contain phytoestrogens, oxalates and phytates and these can effect the endocrine system, especially your thyroid hormone. Regular drinking water from the tap and the plastic bottles can also effect fertility. Talk to you Naturopathic Doctor about how [your diet might be effecting your health](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/nutrition-and-diet-counselling.html) and in turn your fertility. 2. Stress - Everyone goes through [moderate amounts of stress](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/stress-management/toronto-stress-management-centre.html) on a day to day basis. Stress is perceived differently by everyone. Stress is defined as anything that puts the body out of its normal state of being. This would include mental, emotional, dietary, psychological, physical elements. Nutrient status, sleep disturbance, inadequate protein, all of these can create undue stress on the body as well. The body responds by producing [cortisol, a stress hormone](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/stress-management/testing-for-stress-hormones.html), which in turn will effect your female and male hormones and eventually your [thyroid hormone](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/thyroid/diagnostic-testing-for-thyroid-problems.html), and it turn effect fertility. 3. Physiological problems - This relates more to the actual reproductive organs and their placement in the body. Blocked fallopian tubes, issues with sperm count and motility, are some of the factors that may definitely effect fertility. Emotional issues around getting pregnant are a huge factor that effect fertility. Naturopathic Doctors do take into account all of the above before starting any natural treatments for fertility. There are various other factors that can effect fertility that can be improved using naturopathic medicine. The ones mentioned above are just for starters, for more information check [Fertility - causes and naturopathic treatments](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/infertility/toronto-fertility-program.html).
