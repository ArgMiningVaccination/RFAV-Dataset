Gustatory, medically, refers to the sense of taste. The sense of taste helps identify food and forms a taste preference, although the appeal of both sweet- and salty-tasting substances, in large part at least, is innately determined (Beauchamp and Cowart, 1985). Gustatory behaviors, such as neophobia and taste aversion learning, suggest that the gustatory information from the taste buds is compared to gustatory memories at all times during food intake, and thus we avoid ingesting novel or harmful food. Gustatory memories enable us to generate vivid perceptions of taste in the absence of peripheral gustatory inputs. Thus, not only signals from the peripheral gustatory nervous system but also those obtained by recalling gustatory memories play a critical role for gustatory information processing.

Statute of Limitations Students who are candidates for the Bachelor of Science in Business degree have the right to complete degree requirements specified by the bulletin in effect at the time they matriculated at Indiana University, provided (1) that the necessary courses are available, and (2) that no more than eight calendar years have elapsed since matriculation. In the event that courses are not available or more than eight years have elapsed, students must consult with a Business advisor to update their programs to the bulletin currently in effect. Junior College, Community College, and Correspondence Study Credits The maximum number of credit hours allowed from a community or junior college is 64 unless otherwise approved in an articulation agreement.

In addition, it equips the prospective business executive with tools for analysis, prediction, decision-making, and control. It also provides an excellent background for students considering graduate work in business administration or law. Career in Public Accounting (CPA) To sit for the CPA Exam in Indiana, a minimum of 150 credit hours and certain specified courses are required. IU Kokomo's degree with an accounting concentration satisfies all course specifications. You can sit for the CPA Exam as soon as you have earned 150 hours. Steps to a CPA: (1) Earn the 120-hour Baccalaureate Degree in Business with concentration in Accounting at IU Kokomo. (2) Ways to earn 150 hours of college work at IU Kokomo. Method #1. Earn a Master of Business Administration degree (only an additional 33 credit hours). A master's degree will be worth much more in the way of prestige and lifetime earnings than merely achieving 150 hours of college work or taking a double major. Method #2. Earn the Post Baccalaureate Certificate. For students who already possess a bachelor's degree in a field other than accounting. It requires 30 hours of accounting and 24 hours of non-accounting business courses. Careers in corporate, governmental, and not-for-profit accounting do not require 150 hours of college credits. A baccalaureate degree in accounting is sufficient. Students who do not wish to pursue a career in public accounting have many other career options, including corporate, governmental, and not-for-profit accounting. The 120-hour Baccalaureate degree will qualify the graduate to sit for some certification exams designed for these private sector careers, such as the Certified Management Accountant (CMA) and the Certified Internal Auditor (CIA) exams; however, no certification is required for a private sector career.

Policies Governing the Master of Business Administration Degree (MBA) Admission Requirements To qualify for admission to the MBA program, a person must hold a bachelor's degree or equivalent from an accredited college or university. This degree may be in business or another field. All admission decisions are based upon the student's undergraduate grade point average, GMAT score*, professional work experience, and their statement of achievement. To apply, please submit the following: 1) completed application, personal statement of achievement, and resume; 2) official college or university transcripts from all institutions attended; 3) Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT) score*; 4) application fee; and 5) applicants whose native language is not English must demonstrate proficiency in English. The MBA program admits students for fall, spring and summer semesters. Application deadlines for domestic students are June 15 for fall entry, November 1 for spring entry and March 1 for summer entry. Application deadlines for international students are June 1 for fall entry and October 1 for spring entry only. A $60 application fee is required for international applicants. Applicants must meet Indiana University Kokomo's graduate English proficiency requirements. *Applicants whose AI exceeds 1000 using a converted GRE score (as calculated by 200 x undergraduate GPA + converted GRE score) are exempted from the GMAT requirement. **Applicants holding a graduate degree from an appropriately accredited college or university may be exempted from the GMAT requirement if they earned an undergraduate GPA of 3.75 or higher. Overall Program Requirements Graduation with the MBA degree requires successful completion of a minimum of 30 credit hours. A person holding an undergraduate degree in business administration might complete the program in 30 credit hours, whereas an individual having none of the Phase Ifoundation course work would require up to 6 additional Phase I courses. Waiver of Phase I foundation courses is determined through an analysis of an applicant's transcripts. Degree requirements must be completed within six years of admission. Student Course Load Most MBA students at IU Kokomo are employed full time in positions of responsibility. The high standards and workload in the MBA program requires considerable time and effort that must be balanced with other life and work demands. For this reason, part-time students are advised to take no more than 6 credit hours in fall and spring, and 3 credit hours during any one summer session. Course schedules are constructed accordingly, with most courses offered after 4 p.m. Transfer of Credit Up to 6 graduate credit hours may be transferred into Phase II of the MBA program from an AACSB accredited or AACSB candidate schools. No graduate courses where the student earned below a B can be transferred into the program. Transfer credit determination is made by the MBA director in consultation with the appropriate faculty. Only grades earned at Indiana University count toward a student's grade point average. Grades from other universities transfer as credits only. Waiver As noted above, Phase I foundation course requirements may be waived if satisfactory completion of equivalent course work is demonstrated in the student's undergraduate or graduate transcript (B or higher grade required). Work experience and noncredit courses normally do not satisfy the foundation requirements, but may serve as confirming evidence along with academic course work. Validation exams are available for several Phase I courses. Academic Standards Graduation with the MBA degree requires a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.0 or a B average. A student whose GPA falls below 3.0 will be placed on probation and will be required to bring the GPA back to 3.0 within the next 9 credit hours of course work. Failure to remove the deficiency in this timeframe will result in immediate dismissal from the program. A student cannot compensate for deficient course work by completing more credits beyond those required in the program of study. Students must take the ETS exam as a requirement for graduation. Advising Shortly after admission to the program, each MBA student will plan a program of study with the MBA Director. In addition, MBA students seeking career development information are encouraged to confer with the faculty in their area of interest. The IU Kokomo Career Services office is available for career information, and students' own employers often provide career planning assistance. Degree Application Candidates for a degree are expected to meet proper deadlines for the filing of degree applications. Graduation dates at IU Kokomo occur in December, May, and August. Students planning to graduate in December must apply forSeptember 8, 2016 19 their degrees by September 15. The application deadline for May and August graduations is January 15. Decision-Making and Appeal Process The Curriculum Management and Assurance of Learning Committee (CMALC) is the main governing body for the MBA program. This committee, which is responsible for academic policy and curriculum, consists of members of the faculty, the dean of the school (ex- officio), and the MBA director. It is also responsible for recommending admission policy, handling appeals concerning admissions, grades, and related academic matters for which a student seeks redress. The MBA director is the program executive, responsible for day- to-day operations, referring applicants to the admission committee and program advising.

The Kokomo School of Education was later established to serve the growing needs of north central Indiana citizens for easily accessible quality programs. The campus awarded its first Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education degree inSeptember 8, 2016 31 1969 and the Master of Science in Education degree in May 1985. Mission The School of Education maintains the highest standards for students in its initial teacher education programs. The successful teacher must master both a body of content knowledge and effective teaching skills. The initial teacher education programs offer a balance of broad liberal arts education and specialized knowledge in professional education and concentrated areas. Students choose from a variety of options to fulfill their educational requirements. The School's advanced teacher education program provides practicing classroom teachers with graduate study aligned with the National Board for Professional Teacher Standards. P-12 classroom teachers gain advanced knowledge of educational foundations, technology, inquiry, subject area content and content pedagogy. The purposes of the initial teacher education programs are (1) to prepare students to serve as effective teachers and members of the profession, (2) to assist students in meeting Indiana certification requirements for public school personnel, and (3) to assist Indiana University graduates in securing satisfying professional positions. The purposes of the advanced teacher education program are (1) to prepare P-12 classroom teachers in reflective and inquiry-based practices, (2) to prepare P-12 classroom teachers in effectively and efficiently utilizing technology in their practice, and (3) to ultimately improve classroom teaching and student learning in central Indiana. Programs The School of Education offers two baccalaureate degrees: Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education, and a Bachelor of Science in Secondary Education. In addition, a post-baccalaureate licensing program and a Master of Science in Education is offered at IU Kokomo. Accreditation The Indiana University Kokomo School of Education initial and advanced teacher education programs are accredited by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE), and the Indiana Department of Education. Student's Responsibility Advisors assist students in planning a program of study to satisfy requirements; however, each student assumes final responsibility for meeting deadlines and completing requirements for licensure and/or graduation. It is therefore essential that all students be familiar with the degree and licensure requirements set forth in the bulletin and student handbooks. Affirmative Action The School of Education has a strong policy against discrimination that affects student teaching and teacher placement. Discrimination refers to the exclusion of a teacher or a prospective teacher from any position, assignment, or learning opportunity on the basis of any of the following criteria: race, color, minor variations in accent or dialect, religion, gender, national or social origin, economic condition of birth, age, disability, sexual orientation, or any other criterion not directly related to ability as a teacher. The central characteristic of discrimination is the denial of an objective judgment of individual worth by assigning, deliberately orunintentionally, stereotyped status to an individual. It thus introduces criteria that are not relevant to confirmable professional judgment of the quality of an individual's performance. Any complaint concerning discrimination should be called to the attention of the Dean of the School of Education at IU Kokomo. Services Available to Education Students Placement Services for Education Students The Office of Placement and Student Services in the School of Education at Bloomington accepts registration from any person who has either earned a degree from Indiana University or who successfully completed 30 credit hours at Indiana University. Students are encouraged to complete their placement dossiers prior to graduation. The IU Kokomo Office of Career Development and Placement also is available to assist students in preparing and conducting a job search. The office is a point of contact between employers and students or alumni seeking employment. Other Opportunities Undergraduate Research Opportunities are frequently available for undergraduate students to work with faculty on education research projects, and they may be supported by grants. Each student is strongly encouraged to consult with faculty whose academic area is congruent with the student's interest. Honors Program Students with at least a 3.3 grade point average are eligible to earn both university and education honors. Honors in education may be completed within two years and include a summer internship. Interested students should contact the Honors program director for further information. Organizations A student organization, the Education Student Advisory Council (EdSAC), represents elementary student concerns to the School of Education to faculty and administration. In addition, EdSAC provides opportunities for education and service to students beyond the formal classroom. The organization promotes educational leadership skills and assists the School in various professional activities. meshEd At Indiana University Kokomo, students may obtain their grades 5-12 licensure in one of six content areas: Mathematics, English/Language Arts, Science (Chemistry, Physics, Physical Science, Earth/Space Science, or Life Science), Social Studies (History, Political Science, Sociology, Psychology, or Economics), Fine Arts: Visual Arts, and Exceptional Learners: Mild Intervention. It is the goal of meshEd to work together to represent the interests of all six content areas, as well as Education. Members of meshEd plan events and workshops, as well as schedule speakers to supplement the Education classes offered by IU Kokomo. Pi Lambda Theta Pi Lambda Theta is an international honor and professional association of professionals from all levels of education, the health professions, and library science who have achieved high academic excellence and have a demonstrated potential for leadership. Organized in 1910, Pi Lambda Theta now has more than 16,000 members in campus and community-based chapters. The Indiana University Kokomo chapter, Gamma Gamma,32 September 8, 2016 has won awards for both innovation and leadership. Professional Organizations Students in the education programs at IU Kokomo are strongly encouraged to join and support external associations in their field, including the International Reading Association, the Association for Childhood Education, the National Science Teachers Association, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, the National Council for the Social Studies, and the National Council for Teachers of English. Undergraduate Programs Changes in Program Requirements All program descriptions reflect current regulatory guidelines, but programs may be altered by the School of Education to meet changing requirements of the Indiana Department of Education. Every effort will be made to ensure that changes do not jeopardize the progress of the matriculated student. However, students who extend their programs over several years should expect to be required to complete current standards. Students should confer with their advisor concerning the current educational requirements. Admission Requirements Students are admitted directly into the School of Education upon declaring an education major. To complete admission, each student must attend an orientation seminar and be assigned an advisor. Admission to the education major does not guarantee subsequent admission to the Teacher Education Program. Transfer Credit Policies The following policies govern the transfer of credit at IU Kokomo and in this program: 1.The Office of Admissions determines the credit that may be accepted from other institutions and applied toward a degree. 2.Courses from other institutions applied toward an undergraduate education degree must be equivalent to courses offered at Indiana University. 3.Credit is only accepted for work from approved accredited institutions. 4.No more than 64 credits required by the degree earned at a junior or community college will apply toward an undergraduate degree at Indiana University. 5.No credit will be allowed for work in which the student has earned a letter grade lower than C or its equivalent. Teacher Education Program (TEP) The IU Kokomo teacher education programs leading to initial licensure in Indiana are based on the Professional Educator Model, which is aimed at the development of teachers from novice to professional.

Majors/Minors Bachelors Degrees Bachelor of Arts in Psychology Bachelor of Science in Psychology, General Science Track Bachelor of Science in Psychology, Psychological Science Track Minors Psychology Courses Undergraduate Courses Bachelor of Arts in Psychology The Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology provides broad coverage of modern scientific psychology, including the methods by which knowledge is acquired in this field. As a science, psychology seeks to understand the basic principles by which living organisms adapt their behavior to the changing physical and social environments in which they live. The breadth of the discipline, with its links to the humanities, mathematics, computer sciences, and other social and natural sciences, encourages the development of broad problem-solving skills through exposure to research methodology and statistical analysis and contributes to personal growth and the development of communication skills. The psychology major requirements reflect the belief of the faculty that all psychology majors should be exposed to a core of courses, and be allowed to select other courses in the field that are of particular interest. The major is designed so that, in consultation with his or her advisor, each student will be prepared to enter the workforce prepared for positions in human services, social services, or business areas such as personnel or management. The major requirements are also suitable for the psychology major who is considering furthering his or her education at the graduate level in social work, marriage and family counseling, vocational counseling, or the more traditional applied and experimental psychology programs.

Women and Gender Studies Women and Gender Studies is a rapidly growing academic field dedicated to the study of women and their changing position in society. Its importance lies both in its interdisciplinary approach to the study of women and in the timely opportunity it offers for the study of issues long neglected by traditional academic scholarship. Minoring in Women and Gender Studies can potentially complement any major at Indiana University Kokomo. The minor helps students understand the position of women in society, the changes that come about through efforts to eradicate discriminatory social practices, and the transformation still needed to achieve a just and caring society. Such knowledge and sensitivity to women's concerns should enrich students' educational experience both personally and professionally, give insight into their own situations and society, and enable them to work more effectively in their careers. For more information on the minor in Women's Studies, please contact your academic advisor. Requirements for the Minor in Women and Gender Studies62 September 8, 2016 The Women's Studies minor requires the completion of 15 credit hours: 3 required credit hours and 12 credit hours of elective Women's Studies courses approved by the Women and Gender Studies Committee.

Part-time students are eligible for the Dean's List after the completion of 12 credit hours and for each semester they have accumulated an additional 12 credit hours of course work on the Kokomo campus with a GPA of 3.5 or higher. To graduate with academic distinction, baccalaureate students must complete a minimum of 60 credit hours at Indiana University and be in the top 10 percent of the graduating class. (Academic distinction is campus- and program specific. Students should check with the Advising Center for Allied Health and Nursing on the Kokomo campus for policy interpretation and procedures.) Sigma Theta Tau The School of Nursing at IU Kokomo is a proud member of the Alpha Chapter of Sigma Theta Tau, the International Honor Society of Nursing. The mission of the Honor Society of Nursing, Sigma Theta Tau International (STTI) is advancing world health and celebrating nursing excellence in scholarship, leadership, and service. Membership is by invitation to baccalaureate and graduate nursing students who demonstrate excellence in scholarship, and to nurse leaders exhibiting exceptional achievements in nursing. Back General Policies for IU Kokomo School of Nursing Student Responsibility Students admitted to the School of Nursing are responsible for knowing and completing all requirementsfor their degree program. Academic counselors, faculty, and administrators are available to clarify the academic requirements and assist students in academic planning to progress toward their degree. All policies contained in the Indiana University Kokomo Bulletin are applicable for the year in which students are admitted to the Bachelor of Science in Nursing Degree program. The university and School of Nursing have ultimate authority to implement policy/curriculum changes as needed. All students are responsible for acquainting themselves with all university and School of Nursing policies pertaining to their admission, progression, and graduation, and will be subject to policy or curriculum changes as they progress. Students are accountable for compliance with the same throughout their course of study. Disability Statement Some students may have disabilities that would influence their ability to meet nursing program requirements at IU Kokomo. If you have a documented disability or other needs that may require consideration you are responsible for contacting the Career and Accessibility Center at 765.455.9301, Kelley Center Room 200 regarding your needs. The School of Nursing will make reasonable accommodation to assist the student with documented disabilities to successfully complete all requirements of the nursing program. If there is a question about whether a student's disability will interfere with successful program completion, the Student Affairs Committee will consider the case with the assistance of the Affirmative Action Officer. The School of Nursing makes no guarantee to students regarding accommodations that will be made for NCLEX testing or in future professional employment. Confidentiality of Student Records In accordance with federal statutes and regulations, student records are confidential. Disclosure of any information contained in these records to anyone other than the student will be made only in accordance with procedures described in the Code of Student Ethics. Professional Liability Insurance All undergraduate nursing students have liability insurance under the malpractice contract of Indiana University. This policy covers students only while caring for patients/clients in the student role as part of an IU course. Health Insurance Students are required to have health insurance once admitted to the major, and should carry their card with them during each clinical course. Should an incident necessitating student treatment occur while in the clinical setting, associated costs will be the responsibility of the student and billed to the student's insurance provider. Failure to maintain health insurance is grounds for dismissal from the program. Health Requirements All nursing students must provide evidence of compliance with health and safety requirements (immunizations, drug and TB testing, physical examination, background check, CPR, and orientation requirements). Failure to adhere to the policy as posted in the BSN Student Handbook may lead to serious consequences, up to and including course failure and program dismissal.September 8, 2016 101 Requirements are subject to change at the discretion of healthcare agencies. Student result information will be provided to the clinical agency upon request. Notification of requirement changes will be forwarded as soon as they are communicated to the school. Submission of this documentation is a requirement of the healthcare agencies, and not a requirement of the university. Failure to submit the documentation will result in non-placement for clinical courses, and thus prohibit the student from progressing in the nursing major. Clinical Attendance Missing 20% or more of the clinical hours for a course will constitute failure in that course. Further guidance may be found in the BSN Student Handbook. Inappropriate Behavior in Clinical Setting If at any time, in the judgment of an IU Kokomo School of Nursing faculty member, a student appears to be unable to perform clinical responsibilities safely or in any way compromises safe client care, the student will be dismissed from clinical for that day and may not return until the situation is resolved to the satisfaction of the School of Nursing. If a representative of the clinical facility and/or faculty member requests the student have a drug screen prior to leaving the facility, the student must comply (at the student's expense) or face dismissal from the nursing program. Further guidance may be found in the BSN Student Handbook. Standardized Testing Students in the pre-licensure nursing major will be required to take standardized competency tests pertaining to each of the major content areas throughout the curriculum, as well as at program entry and near graduation. These exams may be scheduled at times other than course meeting times. Further guidance may be found in the BSN Student Handbook. Dosage Calculation Testing Students must pass a medication administration proficiency exam at 90% in the sophomore 2 semester in order to progress to the junior year. Medication calculation questions may appear on any or all core nursing exams, even if such calculation was not a part of the material taught directly in that course. Dress Code While in clinical and laboratory experiences, nursing students are expected to wear professional attire and the approved photo identification badge in compliance with the BSN Student Handbook. Students not appropriately attired may be asked to leave the clinical area by their instructor. BSN students admitted to the nursing major are required to purchase the official Indiana University Kokomo crimson uniform bearing the Indiana University logo. The IU Kokomo crimson scrub uniform is to only be worn when the student is in clinical or laboratory or other activities in which the student is representing the School of Nursing. While in uniform, students are expected to behave in a professional manner. Transportation Requirements Clinical learning experiences are varied in setting, location, day of week, and time of day. Students areresponsible for providing their own transportation to and from all clinical experiences. Drug-Free Campus Policy Students are prohibited by Indiana University to use or possess alcoholic beverages, any drug or controlled substance, or drug paraphernalia on university property or in the course of a university activity or student organization activity. Students are responsible for acquainting themselves with this policy and with sanctions for violation of the policy. This policy includes any educational experience associated with successfully completing the nursing program. Eligibility for Licensure Those who apply for licensure examination as a registered nurse in the state of Indiana are required to submit to the Indiana State Board of Nursing written evidence, verified by oath, that they (1) have not been convicted of any act that would constitute grounds for disciplinary sanction under the State Board rules and regulations, or any felony that has direct bearing on their ability to practice competently (note that convictions include the possession and use of alcohol, drugs or controlled substances); (2) have completed an approved high school course of study or its equivalent, as approved by the appropriate educational agency; (3) have completed all graduation requirements at a state-accredited school of nursing; (4) have completed a criminal background check; and (5) fingerprinting. It is each student's responsibility to meet licensure application deadlines. Students wishing to take the licensure examination in another state must contact that state's board of nursing directly. International students and graduates of foreign nursing programs should contact the Indiana State Board of Nursing for specific licensure requirements. Sex Offenders Screening Policy The Indiana Sex Offenders Registry is reviewed every semester for all enrolled students. Any student enrolled in an undergraduate nursing program who has been convicted of a sex offense against children shall be dismissed from the program. Any student already admitted to an undergraduate nursing program whose name appears on the Registry during the time of enrollment in the nursing major shall be ineligible for continuation or completion of their current or any other nursing program. Back Academic Policies for Undergraduate Nursing Programs Good Standing In order to remain in good standing, a student must: Maintain a grade of C (2.0) or above in required general education (pre-nursing) courses, with not more than one repeat in any course. Repeat no more than three (3) required general education courses. Of the three (3) courses, no more than two (2) courses may be a science. Maintain a grade of C (2.0) or above in each Nursing major course. Progression102 September 8, 2016 Progression to the next level of didactic and clinical courses is contingent upon successful completion of the previous semester's general education, didactic, and clinical courses. Academic Probation A student will be placed on academic probation when the semester grade point average is below a 2.0 or when the cumulative grade point average falls below a 2.0 on a 4.0 scale. Academic probation will be removed following the semester in which the cumulative and semester grade point averages are 2.0 or higher. Continuation in the Program The internal grade point average (nursing GPA) must be at least 2.0 to enter each semester of the program. Dismissal A student will be dismissed from the program when any of the following situations occur: 1.Failure of more than three (3) required general education courses. Of the three (3) courses, only two (2) failures will be allowed in science coursework. Any grade below C (2.0) is considered failing. 2.Failure to achieve an internal grade point average (nursing GPA) of 2.0 at the completion of each semester. 3.Failure to achieve a 2.0 IU semester grade point average in any two consecutive semesters. 4.Failure to achieve a grade of C (2.0) or above in any two nursing courses or co-requisite sets of didactic and laboratory (clinical) nursing courses on the first attempt. 5.Failure to achieve a grade of C (2.0) or above in any one nursing course or in one of a co-requisite set of didactic and laboratory (clinical) nursing courses by the second attempt. 6.Failure to meet probationary stipulations (for example, learning contracts and tutoring sessions) in the semester following the assignment of probation. 7.Lack of personal integrity, as demonstrated by but not limited to falsification of records and reports, plagiarism, or cheating on an examination, quiz, or any other assignment. 8.A health condition that has the potential to place the student or patients under his/her care at a safety risk. 9.Failure to adhere to legal and ethical professional requirements, including, but not limited to confidentiality rules (i.e. HIPAA). Students who are admitted to the major but fail to register for first semester courses must seek readmission to the program, subject to competitive review. Any student who has been dismissed from the school has the right to make an appeal according to the guidance in the BSN Student Handbook. Withdrawal Policies 1.Withdrawal from a required general education course in the semester indicated in the curriculum design requires approval from the Advising Center for Allied Health and Nursing.2.Once admitted to the major, students may have only 2 nursing course withdrawals. 3.If a student withdraws from any course with a co- requisite didactic, clinical or lab component, they must withdraw from all components in which they do not already have a final grade assigned. 4.Failure to register in each sequential semester, excluding summer sessions, constitutes withdrawal from the nursing program. 5.After the date for withdrawal with an automatic 'W' has passed, if a student chooses to withdraw from any course the instructor may assign a grade of either W or F, depending upon the level of work to date. Reinstatement Students who have interrupted their nursing program for at least 1 semester and wish to return need to adhere to the following procedural steps: (1) submit written notification of their intent to reenter the program to the Nursing and Allied Health Advising Center AND the pre-licensure track assistant dean by March 15 for fall semester, or October 15 for spring semester; and (2) submit current health and safety requirements August 1 for fall semester, or December 1 for spring semester. All requests for reentry will be evaluated on the basis of the availability of classroom and clinical space. Regardless of the reason for the extended absence, the 6- year rule applies for program completion. Students whose program progression is interrupted will be subject to any curriculum and/or policy changes occurring during the period of interrupted progress. All students must successfully complete an individualized clinical and math skill competency plan as determined by the Assistant Dean of the Pre-Licensure Track or designee prior to the start of the semester for clinical re-entry/ continuation. Intercampus Transfers Students in the nursing major who are in good academic standing may seek intercampus transfer by sending a written request to the Advising Center for Allied Health and Nursing. Intercampus transfer requests will be evaluated individually on the basis of student record review. Transfer students must meet or exceed admission qualifications relevant to the class into which transfer is requested. Further, the availability of courses, faculty, and facilities to meet student needs and program objectives will be considered. Academic Status Full-time status is given to undergraduate students enrolled in 12 or more credit hours during a regular semester or 6 or more credit hours during a summer term. Enrollment of fewer than 12 credit hours during a regular semester or fewer than 6 during a summer term constitutes part-time status. This may impact the student's qualification for financial aid. Auditing of Courses Students have the option of registering for non-nursing classes on a credit or audit basis. Students who are auditing must officially register for a class and pay the applicable fees. Upon completion, the course is enteredSeptember 8, 2016 103 on the permanent university transcript as taken for no credit (NC). Required general education courses taken for NC will not apply toward completion of nursing program requirements. Students may not audit any lab or clinical nursing course. The opportunity to audit a didactic nursing course is dependent on the availability of space and demonstration of adequate program progression on the part of the student. Correspondence/Independent Study Courses Students must have completed any correspondence/ independent study courses prior to enrollment in the final semester of the program or register for the on-campus course in the final semester. Prior Learning Credit Any student, pre-licensure BSN or RN to BSN, may earn up to 15 credits of prior learning credit. Of these 15 hours, up to 3 credit hours of nursing elective credit may be earned by pre-licensure BSN students, and up to 6 credit hours of nursing elective credit may be earned by RN to BSN students. The student must provide evidence acceptable to a committee of nursing faculty that such credit is warranted. For example--a military medic may apply for such credits based on the work she/he did in the field. For RNs elective credit may be related to work experience--1 credit hour for each 4 continuous years of at least 20 hours/week employment (up to 6 credits) or a national certification (3 credits), etc. Elective nursing credits do not take the place of required nursing courses. The remaining credits (up to a total of 15 for previous learning) may come from the student petitioning the school normally responsible for those credits--if the student wants to get credit for a composition course then the student must petition the English Department, etc. This might be a student who has written copy for a newspaper and can bring their portfolio of work to show the committee in the English Department so they can judge the quality and appropriateness of the work to meet a given course's requirements. For RN to BSN students, the Assistant Dean of the RN to BSN track will determine appropriateness of all credit requests. Prior learning credit is based on work or life experience, not on formal education as formal education that has credits associated may be transferred in as appropriate. Priolor learning credits do not include the 35 credits students are granted upon completion of a certain portion of the RN to BSN curriculum. Determination of Grade Point Average (GPA) The Cumulative Grade Point Average is a reflection of all work completed at Indiana University. Courses transferred from another institution are not used in calculating this average. The Interim Grade Point Average reflects grades received between the time students are admitted to the nursing major and the time that they actually begin nursing course work. Students must maintain a 2.5 interim GPA, or admission to the major will be revoked. If the admission is revoked, reapplication to the major is required. The Pre- nursing Grade Point Average includes all IU and transfer grades earned in the pre-nursing courses applicable toward the program, including initial and repeat attempts and excluding IU FX'd grades.Nursing Contact Hours Theory or didactic course credits are generally arranged on a one-to-one credit/contact hour basis. (For example, a 3-credit-hour course meets three hours per week for 15 weeks.) Clinical laboratory courses are scheduled in a 1-to-3 ratio. (For example, a 2-credit course meets six hours per week for 15 weeks). Additionally, the School of Nursing abides by a 50-minute hour in clinical and lab courses. Some differences may occur in courses with significant online or outside experiential learning. Back Bachelor of Science in Nursing Program of Study The purpose of the baccalaureate program is to offer a program for the education of professional nurses prepared to meet current and future healthcare needs of society. The curriculum prepares a generalist in professional nursing and prepares students for graduate study. Baccalaureate education in nursing requires a broad foundation in the sciences and humanities necessary for preparing professional nurses capable of practicing as knowledgeable generalists, and who are responsible, informed citizens in a democratic society. The baccalaureate graduate in nursing uses the nursing process to assist clients in attaining mutually established health goals and in adapting patterns of functioning to promote maximum health potential. As a generalist, the graduate practices in the roles of provider of care, manager of care, and member of the profession. The baccalaureate nurse is responsible and accountable for providing quality nursing care in practice settings that include, but are not limited to, hospital, home, and community. The graduate demonstrates leadership behavior in collaborating with interdisciplinary health team members and others to design health care plans and to develop more efficient and effective approaches to health care delivery and achievement of desired health outcomes. Program Outcomes for the Bachelor of Science in Nursing meet the nationally recognized standards: BSN Essentials for Baccalaureate Nursing Practice (2008), the ANA Code of Ethics for Nurses, the ANA Standards of Practice, and the Indiana State Nurse Practice Act. Differences are based on degree track that relate to the distinctive needs of the pre-licensure and RN to BSN student. Degree Requirements Prospective students should study the requirements for admission to the School of Nursing, the specific curriculum requirements, course sequences, and requirements for the degree. Students are responsible for meeting degree requirements and making application for degree candidacy. The School of Nursing is not responsible for student degree certification if they do not file a graduation application. Application for the degree must be made by the deadlines published by Indiana University Kokomo School of Nursing. All candidates for the degree Bachelor of Science in Nursing must fulfill the following requirements: 1.Meet IU residency requirements;104 September 8, 2016 2.Satisfactory completion of a minimum of 120 credit hours that apply to the degree; 3.Credits earned in remedial skills courses do not apply to the degree Bachelor of Science in Nursing; 4.Credits from courses that have been repeated may be counted only one time to meet degree requirements; 5.Minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.5 and minimum 2.7 grade point average in the courses required to apply to the major; 6.Minimum grade of C (2.0) in a required course or equivalent by the second completed attempt; 7.May repeat no more than three (3) courses totaling 11 credit hours in the general education courses to earn a C (2.0) or higher, of which no more than two (2) courses may be a science; and 8.Students must complete all coursework within six (6) years of receipt of a first semester sophomore year nursing course grade. Back Pre-Licensure Bachelor of Science Track (For students who are not already RNs) For program information, contact Assistant Dean Bridget Whitmore, MSN, at 765.455.9274 or Outcomes: The IU Kokomo BSN graduate will meet program outcomes and embody them in their professional practice as a nurse who is: 1.a critical thinker who demonstrates intellectual engagement and uses evidence as a basis for clinical reasoning and decision making; 2.a culturally sensitive person who provides holistic, patient-centered nursing care for individuals, families, and communities; 3.a knowledgeable care coordinator who facilitates access to resources across the continuum of health care environments in order to meet the evolving health care needs of individuals, families, communities, and populations; 4.an individual who understands and considers the impact of health care policy, finance, and regulatory environments on care delivery; 5.an individual who embodies the professional identity of the nurse and who translates the inherent values of the nursing profession into the ethical and legal practice of nursing; 6.an effective communicator who collaborates with interprofessional team members, patients, and their support systems for improved health outcomes; 7.a competent care provider who is prepared to practice to the full capacity of the professional nurse role in diverse health care environments; 8.an accountable leader and manager who applies principles of systems and organizational processes and who balances resources to promote quality care and patient safety; and 9.an individual who embraces and employs innovations in information management and technology in the delivery of quality patient care.

Consideration of Applications to the Pre-Licensure Nursing Track: Applicants must meet the deadlines for filing an application for admission. If a student is admitted to the nursing major but declines to accept, the student must reapply for reconsideration, and admission is not guaranteed. The student who fails to accept the offer of admission to the major for the second time is no longer eligible for future consideration. All students with completed applications who meet all of the admission criteria stated herein will be rank ordered according to the sum of the rank of the pre-nursing GPA and the rank results of the standardized pre-nursing achievement examination. Students with at least 12 credits from IU Kokomo will have 5 points subtracted from their overall rank. Selection will begin with students at the lowest (best) rank and proceed until seats are filled or there are no further qualified candidates. Students should direct all inquiries concerning the School of Nursing, counseling, application and admission to the campus where they plan to enroll in the major. Admission to Pre-Licensure Nursing Track Considerations: Unless approved by the School of Nursing administration, nursing major courses are open only to basic students accepted into the School of Nursing after applying and meeting application requirements. Students should direct all inquiries concerning the School of Nursing, counseling, and application to the campus where they plan to enroll in the major. See General Education: Fundamental Skills requirements in the \"Academic Regulations\" section of this bulletin. Please refer to \"Academic Policies for All Nursing Programs\" in this bulletin. Admission to Pre-Licensure Nursing Track: Admission to the School of Nursing is a competitive process. Achievement of minimum application criteria does not guarantee admission. The number of students admitted to the major depends upon the number of student spaces available, faculty, clinical resources, andapplicants' performance on admission criteria. Admission is campus-specific and competitive. Satisfactory completion of the prerequisite courses does not guarantee acceptance to the nursing major. All applicants must be admitted to IU Kokomo as a degree seeking student and be in good academic standing at time of application. All applicants must be advised by a Nursing Advisor. All applicants will have achieved satisfactory performance on a standardized pre- nursing achievement exam. Contact the Advising Center for Allied Health and Nursing for details regarding the exam and necessary scores to qualify for application. At least one of these three required sciences (ANAT- A 215, PHSL-P 215, MICR-J 200/J 201) must be successfully completed in order to apply to the major; at least 2 of these required 3 sciences must be completed to begin the nursing major. One of the following math courses must be completed in order to apply: Math-M 105, Math-M 117, MATH-M 125, MATH-M 118, MATH-M 119, MATH-M 215, MATH-M 133 or M 134. Students may fail (with a C- or below) no more than 3 pre-nursing courses totaling 11 credits. Of the 3 failures, only 2 are allowed in the sciences. Students exceeding any of these limits are ineligible to apply to the nursing program. Cumulative GPA\u2014If an IU GPA is not available the cumulative GPA from his/her most recent institution will be used in determining the cumulative GPA. RN to BSN Completion Track (in person or online) (For students who are RNs and graduated from an associate degree or diploma program) For program information, contact Assistant Dean Angie Heckman, DNP, at 765.455.9202 or The IU Kokomo BSN graduate will meet program outcomes and embody them in their professional practice as a nurse who is: 1.a critical thinker who demonstrates intellectual engagement and uses evidence as a basis for clinical reasoning and decision making; 2.a culturally sensitive person who provides holistic, patient-centered nursing care for individuals, families and communities; 3.a knowledgeable care coordinator who facilitates access to resources across the continuum of health care environments in order to meet the evolving health care needs of individuals, families, communities, and populations; 4.an individual who understands and considers the impact of health care policy, finance, and regulatory environments on care delivery; 5.an individual who embodies the professional identity of the nurse and who translates the inherent values of the nursing profession into the ethical and legal practice of nursing; 6.an effective communicator who collaborates with interprofessional team members, patients, and their support systems for improved health outcomes;106 September 8, 2016 7.a competent care provider who is prepared to practice to the full capacity of the professional nurse role in diverse health care environments; 8.an accountable leader and manager who applies principles of systems and organizational processes and who balances resources to promote quality care and patient safety; and 9.an individual who embraces and employs innovations in information management and technology in the delivery of quality patient care. Hybrid RN to BSN (Pod) Completion Track Admission Policy All applicants must hold an unencumbered Indiana RN license. Applicants must have a cumulative GPA of 2.5 on a 4.0 scale in order to apply. Applicants are considered by cohort according to the categories listed below. The number of students selected for each cohort depends upon the number of student spaces available and applicants' performance on admission criteria. Admission is campus-specific and competitive. Selection will be made at least 45 days prior to the start of the first term for the cohort group. Specific selection dates will be available in the Advising Center for Nursing and Allied Health Sciences. Students will be notified of acceptance by letter. In cases where two cohorts will be started at the same time (i.e. for off-site offering), two separate category lists will be generated. The student may sign up on both lists if desired, however they must attend at the site where accepted. Applications submitted are only good for the cohort beginning in the semester noted on the form. If a student chooses to be considered for another starting semester they must complete and submit a new application. Applicants must also complete a criminal background check through CertifiedBackground.com. Complete applications are due: July 1 for Fall Semester cohort; November 1 for Spring Semester cohort; March 1 for Summer Semester cohort. Please check with your advisor as cohorts of RN to BSN students do not begin every semester, but will begin at least one time per academic year. Category 1: (first priority selection) 1) RN has a Cumulative GPA of at least 2.5 on a 4.0 scale either from Indiana University or from a regionally accredited ASN or Diploma program. In case both GPA scores are available, the higher GPA will be used in determining placement; and 2) Student has 12 or fewer remaining credits needed to meet general education requirements. Students seeking category 1 consideration to a fall semester cohort must meet the above criterion as of the spring immediately preceding the desired fall start date. Students seeking category 1 consideration to a spring semester cohort must meet the above criterion as of summer II immediately preceding the desired spring start date. Students are ranked according to GPA within category 1, and selection begins with the highest GPA. If places are still available at the conclusion of the Category 1 selection process, the selection process will continue to fill available slots with Category 2 students.Category 2: (second priority selection) 1) RN has a Cumulative GPA of at least 2.5 on a 4.0 scale either from Indiana University or from a regionally accredited ASN or Diploma program. In case both GPA scores are available, the higher GPA will be used in determining placement. Students with a GPA of 2.3 - 2.5 may be admitted on a probationary status, but must achieve and maintain a 2.5 GPA in Pod 1 courses in order to progress from Pod 1 forward. This performance standard must be met each successive semester; and 2) Student has more than 12 remaining credits needed to achieve general education requirements. Students in this category are ranked according to the number of general education credits yet to be completed, and selection begins with those needing the fewest credit hours. Students who do not meet the minimum GPA requirements to fulfill these criteria may take courses at Indiana University to generate or improve an IU GPA (and should work with advisors to ensure that courses taken apply to the general education requirements). All Online RN to BSN Completion Track An all online RN to BSN Completion Track is available and delivered via web-based and video technologies rather than requiring the student to come to campus. To apply, contact the IU campus closest to you.

Back Department of Public Administration and Health Management Alan Krabbenhoft, Dean Gloria Preece, Director of MBA and MPM Programs DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT FACULTYSeptember 8, 2016 121 Professor: R. Dibie Assistant Professor: Hur Lecturer: Horn The Department of Public Administration and Health Management (PAHM) offers a Bachelor of Science in Public Administration (BSPA). The department also offers a Master of Public Management (MPM). Both the MPM and BSPA allow students to choose a concentration in either public administration or health management. Accreditation While the PAHM department will be housed alongside the School of Business for administrative purposes, it will be exempt from AACSB review due to its relatively low level of business content. Mission The Department of Public Administration and Health Management (PAHM) is a multidisciplinary unit of Indiana University Kokomo and it is organized as a professional division. It is the mission of PAHM to prepare tomorrow's leaders through innovative education, to solve complex problems through interdisciplinary research, and to enrich society through professional service. The Department of Public Administration and Health Management at Indiana University Kokomo defines the mission of both undergraduate and graduate programs in terms of its responsibility to the profession of public administration and health management; to the public, non-profit, and community organizations which the field supports; to the university and its diverse students; and to the national and international communities they all serve. PAHM's teaching mission is defined in terms of the role the department plays in enabling current and future public servants to develop skills necessary to address challenges posed in public management, health management, and administration in nonprofit organizations, governance, policy-making, implementation, and organizational effectiveness. PAHM strives to orient its students to the public interest, humanistic acumen, personal contribution and to the client/citizens, not merely to technical outcomes. In its service mission role, PAHM strives to fulfill the ideal of public service as an example to the profession and to its students as a means to continued personal development as faculty, to provide leadership, technical support, and mentoring in a manner that recognizes social interdependence, democratic ideals, and the needs of social justice. Through its research mission, PAHM strives to meaningfully address the body of social knowledge and experience through interpretation, re-interpretation, and creative insight. We accept the responsibility for helping to create standards of excellence and conduct for the profession of public administration both nationally and internationally. Subsequently, our academic unit uses the criteria established by the National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration (NASPAA) as a guide for hiring faculty members that are academically and/or professionally qualified to serve as instructors. We are especially concerned with knowledge that promotes a functional and responsible praxis of thought and action in the classroom, in the work environment, and in the society within which they co-exist. Overall, PAHM strives to develop student sensibilities to a wide variety of human, social and organizational realties, which assist public and nonprofit organizations in formulating and achieving responsible social change. Goals As an integral part of the university, the Department is committed to providing an academic andsocial environment for its majors that will develop in each student: 1.A basic understanding of the institutions, processes, and actors in the public administration and health management arenas, with special appreciation of the problems and responsibilities of dispensing public governance, public policy, and health management in a democratic social order. 2.A basic understanding of world public administration and health management so as to provide an appreciation of global diversity and to provide a contrast and comparison to the American system. 3.Strong writing, verbal, and analytical skills that will facilitate successful employment inside and/or outside the public management and criminal justice systems and general life-long learning. 4.A sense of professionalism that will assist the student in being a success in his/her post-graduation endeavors. In the context of these goals, IU Kokomo PAHM department offers course work leading to: Bachelor of Science in Public Administration (BSPA) Graduate Certificate in Public Management (GCPM) Graduate Certificate in Health Management (GCHM) Master of Public Management (MPM) with track in Public Management and Policy Master of Public Management (MPM) with track in Health Management Majors/Minors Undergraduate Degrees Bachelor of Science in Public Administration: Health Management Concentration Public Administration Concentration Minor in Health Management Graduate Degree Master of Public Management (MPM) Graduate Certificate Programs Graduate Certificate in Health Management Graduate Certificate in Public Management Courses Undergraduate Courses Graduate Courses Public Administration Concentration Students with a Bachelor of Science in Public Administration (BSPA) degree can continue their education in law, planning, policy analysis, or business administration.

School of Sciences Professors: Deyo, Kinsey Laboratory Instructor: Houston Mission The mission of the School of Sciences is to provide students with the undergraduate academic, research, and experiential background that will enable them to pursue meaningful careers in science-, mathematics- and informatics-related fields or to meet general education or program requirements in their major. The purposeful combination of theoretical and practical educational experiences coupled with the breadth of the available degrees will enable students to prepare for a wide variety of graduate programs, professional schools, secondary school teaching careers, and/or entry into the workplace. Students graduating from the School of Sciences will be prepared to become lifelong learners who are able to make positive contributions in a world where questions involving scientific and quantitative literacy, environmental quality, sustainability, and technology are becoming increasingly important. Degrees Courses in the School of Sciences can be taken in various areas: natural sciences, mathematics, and informatics. The general studies program is also housed in the School of Sciences. Course descriptions and specific degree requirements for each area follow after a general discussion of curricula and degrees. The School of Sciences offers several Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) and Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degrees, as well as Bachelor of General Studies degree. These degrees are four-year undergraduate degrees requiring 120 credit hours of coursework. Students wishing a greater emphasis on their major will likely opt to earn a B.S. degree in their discipline. The B.S. degrees follow the campus-wide general education curriculum. On the other hand, students wishing a greater emphasis on courses outside the School of Sciences will likely opt to earn a B.A. degree in their selected discipline. The B.A. degrees follow the general education requirements established in the past by theSeptember 8, 2016 133 former School of Arts and Sciences, which has a stronger emphasis on the social sciences and humanities than the campus-wide general education curriculum. However, it also meets the campus-wide general education curriculum. The specific general education requirements for the Bachelor of Arts degrees differ from those required for Bachelor of Science degrees. Thus, students must work closely with an academic advisor to ensure that the appropriate general education courses are taken along with the courses required for their major. The Bachelor of General Studies degree offers a flexible program which consists of a core of arts and sciences courses and a wide range of electives. The BGS degree follows the campus- wide general education curriculum. In addition to the bachelor's degrees, the School of Sciences offer minors in biology, chemistry, environmental and earth sciences, informatics, and mathematics. Minors in areas from different Schools or units on campus can also be completed. Please consult an advisor for additional information. The unique nature and flexibility of the School of Sciences programs enable students to tailor their degree selection to focus their studies in a particular field of interest, thus preparing themselves for a specific career or graduate school objective. Through majors in the School of Sciences, a student may complete all of the pre-professional requirements for medicine, dentistry, chiropractic, veterinary medicine, pharmacy, physician assistant, physical therapy, or optometry in the process of earning a Bachelor's degree at IU Kokomo.

Elective and concentration area courses can be used to meet the campus General Education requirements. Previously Earned Credit Recognition of Previously Earned Credit Many students in the General Studies Program have previously earned academic credit at Indiana University or at other institutions. Such credit is applied to the degree requirements of the B.G.S. degree within the guidelines listed below. Credits Eligible for Transfer from Institutions Other than Indiana University Kokomo A maximum of 90 credit hours [64 from a community college] can be applied to the B.G.S. degree, provided the applicant has earned grades of C or better. In order for transfer credit to be applied in any of the required areas of learning, courses taken must be equivalent in nature to those offered by Indiana University Kokomo in these areas. Courses taken at another institution in which the student received grades of D or F will not be accepted for credit. Credit by Examination at Indiana University Kokomo Students who wish to pursue credit by examination at Indiana University Kokomo should consult with their General Studies degree program advisor. Credit by Examination from Other Institutions If the transcript indicates credit by examination and if students do not enroll in sequential courses to validate their knowledge in the subject matter, credit will be granted only on the basis of review by the appropriate academic department of Indiana University Kokomo. Credit Awarded Through Non-departmental Examinations The General Studies degree program awards credit for such programs as Advanced Placement Examinations, DANTES, and College Level Examination Programs (CLEP). For more information, consult your advisor. Credits Awarded for Educational Programs in Non- collegiate Organizations Where relevant to the academic program, the General Studies degree program, will consider the evaluation and credit recommendations of the two publications below as a guide in awarding credit to persons who have successfully completed non-collegiate or in-company sponsored instruction: The National Guide to Educational CreditSeptember 8, 2016 143 for Training Programs, American Council on Education and A Guide to Educational Programs in Non-collegiate Organizations, The State University of New York. Credit for Self-Acquired Competency (SAC) The General Studies degree program recognizes that students do gain college-level knowledge and understanding through various life experiences that are equivalent to the subject matter of specific courses in the university curriculum or that may be recognized as general-elective credit. Students who believe themselves eligible for such credit may accelerate their college programs by discussing their background in detail with their General Studies degree program advisor. A maximum of 15 credit hours can be awarded for Self- Acquired Competency. Transfer of Self-Acquired Competency Credit within Indiana University Self-acquired competency credit awarded by the faculty of Indiana University Kokomo campus is recorded and explained on the permanent record of the student. The student should be aware, however, that such credit will not necessarily be honored by other degree programs of Indiana University, nor by other institutions. Transfer of Self-Acquired Competency Credit from Other Institutions Up to 15 credit hours of the possible credit toward the B.G.S. degree will be awarded for self-acquired competency previously recognized by other accredited postsecondary institutions. Additional credit hours of self- acquired competency credit from other institutions must be reviewed in the same manner as other Indiana University Kokomo self-acquired competency credit. Military Service Credit Veterans of military service and military personnel on active duty are eligible for academic credit as a result of their military training and experience. The General Studies degree program follows the provisions of the American Council on Education's \"Guide to Evaluation of Educational Experiences in the Armed Services\" in granting credit. Paramedic and EMT certification Special credit for students who have their EMT and/or Paramedic certification can be awarded. Graduation Requirements To be eligible for graduation, students must complete the course work specified in their plans of study with an overall grade point average of 2.0 (C) or better. Students must receive a grade of C- or better in all courses used to fulfill course requirements in the three principal areas and the concentration area of learning. Any course in which a student receives a grade of D will count as a general elective to fulfill total credit hours required for the degree program. Student Responsibility Students should understand that the responsibility for designing an appropriate academic program and for meeting every degree requirement rests with them; academic advisors are obligated only to assist students in meeting this responsibility. Students needing clarificationof any of the requirements for their baccalaureate degrees are urged to obtain that clarification from their academic advisors.

Full-time students must have carried at least 12 credit hours of work throughout a semester with a grade point average of 3.5 or higher. Part-time students must have accumulated a minimum of 12 credit hours during the spring semester, summer session, and fall semester with a grade point average of 3.5 or higher. Academic Affairs honor list students are recognized on Honors Day, prior to Commencement activities. Degree Requirements Each student is responsible for planning his/her own program and for meeting the following degree requirements by the time he/she expects to graduate: 1.Apply to graduate by completing and submitting a degree candidate form. Deadlines and the degree candidate form can be found on the main site at www.iuk.edu/registrar. If degree requirements are not met, a change in the graduation date must be made. It is the responsibility of the student to report this change to his/her advisor. 2.Earn a minimum of 120 credit hours toward a baccalaureate degree and 60 credit hours toward an associate degree, excluding any duplicate course credits. Some curricula require more. 3.Earn 30 of the final 60 credit hours toward a baccalaureate degree and 15 of the final 30 credit hours toward an associate degree from Indiana University Kokomo. 4.To complete a baccalaureate degree, earn a minimum of 30 credit hours at the 300- and 400- level of which 15 must be earned from Indiana University Kokomo. 5.To complete a certificate, 15 credit hours must be earned from Indiana University Kokomo. 6.Earn a minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 2.0. Certain curricula require a higher minimum grade point average. Additional degree requirements may be specified by the school of the students' chosen curricula. Students should consult the relevant section of this bulletin for complete information about degree requirements for their programs. The dean of each college is responsible for certifying the completion of degree requirements for each candidate for graduation. Upon certification of the candidates for graduation, those candidates who are free of all University obligations and who are designated as having completed degree requirements are issued the corresponding diploma from the Office of the Registrar. The academic record isclosed once graduation is certified; no record changes will be permitted once the degree is awarded. No further registrations beyond the semester of completion are permitted. If the graduate desires to pursue a second degree, he/she must be readmitted. Extended X Policy Any undergraduate student may retake an IU course for which he/she received a grade below an A. A student may exercise this option for no more than three courses, totaling no more than 10 credits during an academic career. In addition, a student may use this option only once for a given course. The course in which the student reenrolls should be the same course which is being replaced. However, course numbers and titles occasionally change, and this will be taken into account. For the course retaken, only the second grade shall be counted in the determination of the student's grade-point average (GPA). The grade for the course that has been replaced shall be marked with an \"X\" on the transcript. The student's transcript shall record both grades. To exercise the Extended X option, students must obtain an Extended X form from their academic unit, secure the appropriate signatures, and return the form to the Office of the Registrar. The following regulations apply: 1. The policy applies to undergraduate students only. 2. The FX option applies to all undergraduate schools and divisions on all Indiana University campuses. 3. Any prior undergraduate course will be eligible for replacement if the replacement course is taken Spring 2004 or later under the new policy. 4. Courses repeatable with different content are not eligible for replacement under this policy unless an academic unit chooses to permit this by means of a specific authorization procedure. 5. The following grades cannot be replaced under the Extended X Policy: S, P, W, I R, NC. In addition, a grade may not be replaced with a second grade of W, I, R, or NC. 6. A student who has failed a course due to academic dishonesty may not retake that course for grade replacement under this policy. 7. Enforcement of the Extended X policy shall be the responsibility of the school or division which certifies the student's fulfillment of degree requirements. 8. Problems relating to the policy shall be referred to the school or division dean, or the administrator fulfilling the equivalent responsibility on the campus. 9. This policy does not apply to students enrolled in the Purdue University School of Technology programs. Financial Encumbrance Students who incur a financial encumbrance are not permitted to register for another semester or receive official transcripts and will be denied all university services until the indebtedness is satisfied and the encumbrance is removed. Forgiveness Policy A \"forgiveness policy\" was adopted by IU Kokomo in 1997. The purpose of the policy is to establish an effective means for students to return to IU Kokomo after they have158 September 8, 2016 achieved poorly, affording them a fresh start. For details, go to the main page at www.iuk.edu/registrar. General Education The following General Education curriculum is required of each student who is granted a baccalaureate degree at the Indiana University Kokomo campus. Total credit hours will typically number 42 or 44. Each course must be completed with a passing grade, and students must obtain a minimum GPA of 2.0 in the General Education curriculum. If a student takes more than the required number of courses within a section, the course(s) with the highest grade(s) will be used in the GPA calculation. With the exception of courses jointly listed under Sections 1 and 2, no course can be used twice to satisfy multiple requirements. Some courses may have prerequisites. Students should consult with their advisor for more information. Each student is subject to the General Education requirements in place when they were admitted to IU Kokomo. However, students are always allowed to adopt newer course/program requirements. General Education courses essentially qualify backward and forward within a given student's academic career at IU Kokomo. Here are a few examples: If a course is approved to satisfy an area of the General Education requirements after a student is admitted, the student can elect to use that course even if they took it before the course was approved for use in General Education. If a course that was present when a student enrolled is removed from the General Education requirements (but is still offered), the course can be used even if it is completed after the above change. If a removed course is no longer offered, students will need to adjust and enroll in other approved courses.

SCI-E 105* * To facilitate the graduation checklist process, records will need to be kept at the registrar level or the advisor level indicating the goal satisfied in any given semester (if any). Grading Policy Instructors in undergraduate and graduate courses use a grading system that includes plus and minus grades as well as straight grades for all undergraduate and graduate course records. The registrar computes numerical grades for plus and minus grades when calculating grade point averages (GPAs) cumulative grade point average of 2.0 is required for graduation. Credit points are calculated by multiplying the grade points earned in a course by the number of credit hours for that course. For example, 3 hours of A=12 grade points. The grade point average for a semester is computed by dividing the total number of credit points earned by the number of credit hours attemped. Suppose that a student has earned the following grades in a semester: 3 credit hours of A (12 credit points) 3 credit hours of B (equals 9 credit points) 3 credit hours of C+ (equals 6.9 credit points) 3 credit hours of D- (equals 2.1 credit points) 3 credit hours of F (equals 0 credit points) The semester grade point average would be 2.0 (30 credit points divided by 15 credit hours) Students have access to a GPA calculator online at Graduation with Distinction To graduate with distinction, baccalaureate and associate degree candidates must rank within the highest 10 percent of the graduating class of their respective degree-granting units. Additionally, baccalaureate candidates must have completed a minimum of 60 credit hours in residence on the campus where the degree is awarded. Associate degree candidates must have completed half of the credit hours required for their degree on the campus where the degree is awarded. Holds Holds may be placed on the record of a student for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to, academic, financial or misconduct reasons. A hold may preventSeptember 8, 2016 163 services which may not be accessed without authorization from the office that placed the hold. Incompletes The grade of Incomplete (I) is an agreement between the student and the instructor. It is assigned only when the required work of the course is substantially completed and the student's work is of a passing quality. A grade of Incomplete must be removed within the time stipulated by the instructor; under no circumstances may this exceed one calendar year. If a grade of Incomplete has not been removed within the calendar year of its recording, it will be changed to an F. Students should not register for credit in a course in which they have received a grade of Incomplete. Intercampus Transfer A student changing from the Kokomo campus to another Indiana University campus does not need a transcript; however, arrangements should be made with the academic division to have required credentials other than the permanent record forwarded to the appropriate office on the other campus. Intercampus transfer is an on-line process and information can be found at http:// www.iupui.edu/~moveiu/ . Students on other IU campuses are eligible to complete an intercampus transfer as long as they have not been dismissed from another IU campus. If a student has been dismissed, the IU Kokomo readmission policy applies. Moreover, when a student's GPA and total credits would warrant dismissal from IU Kokomo, IU Kokomo's readmission policy will apply. Students requesting an ICT with a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or greater and a most recent semester GPA of 2.0 or greater are considered in good standing. Students who do not meet the above criteria are probationary transfers. The IU Kokomo policy regarding probation and dismissal will apply to these students. Pass/Fail Option The P/F option, which permits students to designate courses to be recorded for either Pass (P) or Fail (F), is available to all undergraduate students for a maximum of two elective courses per academic calendar year, with a maximum of eight courses to be applied toward graduation. These courses may not include those offered only on a Satisfactory/ Fail basis. Graduate students may elect the option for a maximum of four elective courses (which may be restricted to one such course per semester) to be applied toward graduation. Other specific course limitations vary from division to division. The student should consult a divisional advisor for details. Exercise and approval of the option must be completed by the end of the fourth week of classes during the fall or spring semester, or the second week of classes during the summer session. The student should obtain a Pass/ Fail form from the Office of the Registrar, secure the signature of the chairperson or acting representative of the division, and return the completed form to the Office of the Registrar by the deadline noted above. The grades of A, B, C, and D (pluses and minuses) shall be considered as Pass (P) under the option. In no case will these grades be substituted at a later time in place of aP. The grade of P is not counted in computing grade point averages; the grade of F is included. Instructors will not be notified of those students registering for this option. A final grade of A, B, C, D, or F (pluses and minuses) will be submitted by the instructor and will be converted to the appropriate Pass/Fail grade (P or F) by the registrar. Student Load A student may register for a single course or for a full-time college program. A student who registers for 12 or more credit hours a semester (6 or more per summer session) is regarded as a fulltime student. A student working full time should generally not register for more than 6 credit hours during a regular semester or 3 in the summer session. A teacher who is employed full time is prohibited by the Indiana State Department of Education from earning more than 6 credit hours in one semester. A student who expects to graduate in four academic years, not counting summer sessions, should carry at least 15 credit hours during each semester of the regular academic year. Except with special permission from the advisor, a student is not permitted to enroll in more than 18 credit hours. A minimum grade point average of 3.0 (B) is required if a student wishes to carry more than 18 credit hours. Transcripts Official transcripts may be obtained from the Office of the Registrar. Information about transcripts, including cost and how to order, may be found on the main site at www.iuk.edu/registrar. Withdrawals Students who have officially registered and who wish to withdraw must follow withdrawal procedures. Details and deadlines can be found on the main site at www.iuk.edu/ registrar.

Special Programs The faculty at IU Kokomo have designed two programs that will enhance your academic experience. The IU Kokomo Honors Program offers educational and cultural opportunities to foster intellectual curiosity and professional development. In addition to engaging coursework, honor students are given special opportunities to work with faculty on research projects, to present their work at conferences, and to receive individualized mentoring from faculty members in their major area of study. The Overseas Study Program provides students with opportunities to study in a variety of countries for a semester or a year. In addition, the faculty have designed courses that include one week travel experiences as part of a course. These trips usually occur over spring break or in the summer. Honors Program The IU Kokomo Academic Honors Program offers educational and cultural opportunities to foster intellectual curiosity and professional development for talented, highly motivated, and creative students. In addition to coursework, Honors students are given special opportunities, for example, to participate with faculty on research projects, to present their work at regional conferences, and to receive individualized counseling. There are two types of honors courses. Honors colloquia are three-credit courses that focus on interdisciplinary topics, such as \"Ethics and Technology\" and \"Human Intelligence.\" H-Option courses provide students with a way to gain honors credit from regular courses. An H-Option section runs concurrently with a section of a regular course, and the Honors student attends class with other students. The instructor and the Honors student develop a special set of course requirements to fit the student's abilities and interests; typically these include many of the regular requirements. To do this, students must complete an H-Option contract form with the professor's approval and submit the form to the Honors director, who will then arrange for honors credit upon completion of the project. H-Option course sections may also be set up for internships, independent studies, field- work experience, undergraduate thesis, or other research/ creative projects. Students should consult the Honors Director for currently offered honors courses. Incoming freshman students are eligible to apply if they have combined SAT scores of 1100 or better (or an ACT score of 23) and if they have ranked in the upper 20 percent of their high school graduating class. Continuing students who have completed a minimum of 12 credit hours at IU Kokomo and maintain a GPA of 3.3 or higher are also eligible to apply. There are two notations of student attainment. These are noted on the student's diploma and transcript. Students may attain both University Honors and Honors in their majors. University HonorsSeptember 8, 2016 167 To qualify for the University Honors notation, students must complete 9 credit hours in honors course work inside and outside the major, a presentation of work at a student conference, plus two honors colloquia of 3 credits each. Major Honors Each academic division has special honors courses available for students who are majoring in disciplines offered by the division. (There are no major honors available for AHLT students at this time.) To qualify for the degree in major honors, the student must complete 9 credit hours in honors course work in the major, as determined by the division or department, a presentation of work at a student conference, plus two honors colloquia of 3 credits each. Students may count the same two honors colloquia as satisfying both university and major honors requirements. Major Honors in Nursing The major honors in the baccalaureate nursing program follows the general guidelines of the IU Kokomo University Honors program. Students secure eligibility to participate and remain in the major honors in nursing by attending to the eligibility criteria outlined for the Academic Honors Program. Aware of the special needs of superior nursing students, the Major Honors in Nursing Program provides these outstanding students with a variety of opportunities to enrich their nursing career and the nursing profession overall. To graduate with honors in nursing, a nursing student must complete 6 credit hours in honors courses in nursing as well as two 2-credit hour honors colloquium courses. Honors projects within a course are meant to enhance or broaden regular course work. However, the work is in lieu of specific course activities, not in addition to those activities. Honors activities may include: research papers, field work, visual or oral presentations, creative works, analytical library work, annotating a bibliography, writing a series of position papers, or participating in a major scientific project. Honors nursing students and faculty responsible for teaching the specific honors courses work together to create a project and a contract for completing the project. Overseas Study Program Donna McLean, Coordinator IU Kokomo students are eligible to participate in Indiana University's overseas study programs offered at a number of universities including the Kokomo campus. Most credits earned in these programs are considered Indiana University credits, not transfer credits; however, dependent on the course of study selected, some of the courses offered may earn transfer credits. When students enroll in IU programs, they will discover that most university scholarships and loans are applicable to the fees for these programs. Credit usually satisfies Indiana University degree requirements and generally meets the residence requirements. Programs are not restricted to language majors. In fact, there are a broad range of courses offered in multiple schools, geared to meeting varied student interests. Undergraduate students, particularly liberal arts majors, are encouraged to explore the possibilities of experiencing a semester or an academic year at a university in another country.Overseas Programs IU administered and IU co-sponsored programs include the following: 1.One year of college-level language (College of Arts and Sciences language requirement) or the equivalent. 2.Two years of college-level language or the equivalent. 3.Three years of college-level language or the equivalent.

Gustatory, medically, refers to the sense of taste. The sense of taste helps identify food and forms a taste preference, although the appeal of both sweet- and salty-tasting substances, in large part at least, is innately determined (Beauchamp and Cowart, 1985). Gustatory behaviors, such as neophobia and taste aversion learning, suggest that the gustatory information from the taste buds is compared to gustatory memories at all times during food intake, and thus we avoid ingesting novel or harmful food. Gustatory memories enable us to generate vivid perceptions of taste in the absence of peripheral gustatory inputs. Thus, not only signals from the peripheral gustatory nervous system but also those obtained by recalling gustatory memories play a critical role for gustatory information processing.
