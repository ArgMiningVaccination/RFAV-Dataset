Functional Medicine A term coined in 1993 to describe the \"medicine of the future\", functional medicine refers to a higher standard of care that includes diagnostic precision using the latest laboratory testing, specific assessment of genetic markers, and custom nutraceutical, dietary and lifestyle plans that target prevention on an epigenetic level. When you understand how your body works at this level, you can optimize detoxification pathways, work toward optimal genetic expression, and greatly enhance the quality of life. At Kai Wellness, we are proud to partner with cutting edge technologies at top laboratories to add tremendous value in making functional assessments and treatment in Los Angeles. We also partner with top of the line, innovative nutraceutical companies to help you achieve your best possible health. Chinese Medicine & Acupuncture This time-tested medicine has not only thousands of years of practice but an ever-growing base of clinical evidence to support its powerful yet natural effectiveness. Thin, painless needles are inserted at specific points of the body to open energy channels and clear blockages. Includes: Cupping, Gua Sha, Moxa, and Acupressure. Specialty Acupuncture Styles: Japanese (gentle), Esoteric (spiritual-emotional), Pediatric (non-invasive) and Facial Rejuvenation (cosmetic).

Chinese herbs are a safe and effective, time-tested resource for optimal wellbeing. We proudly use only the highest quality herbs and acupuncture supplies for Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture in Los Angeles. Nutritional Counseling Proper nutrition is essential, and without a doubt - food is medicine. Most physical and emotional conditions can be greatly relieved with proper nourishment and supplementation. More than what we eat, it's how we eat and whether or not our bodies are effectively absorbing nutrients from our foods that make the greatest difference. Instead of promoting any nutritional protocols or fad diets, we customize time-tested and thoroughly researched nutritional strategies for each individual based on their unique needs. Yoga Therapy Combining practices of body movement, awareness, and toning, breathwork, meditation, and Ayurveda (a 5000+ year-old system of traditional Indian internal medicine) to balance the Chakra energy system, Yoga Therapy helps you reclaim physical, emotional and spiritual health and wholeness. As a physical therapy, Yoga Therapy addresses not only the target area - it treats the entire body as a whole. Currently, a vast amount of research is becoming available as to the positive effects of Yoga Therapy on physical ailments, mental health, and spiritual attunement. Reiki Energy Healing Reiki being in the lead, research shows the positive effects of subtle energy healing techniques on the immune system, on mental health, and on recovery from surgery and illness. Gentle placement of hands at various energy centers of the body deeply relax and allow powerful insight to come through. Reiki works great alone, and especially well as an adjunct therapy to any treatment. Cosmetic - Microneedling Microneedling is the insertion of very fine needles into the skin for purpose of rejuvenation. This 30-minute, once per month treatment is used to effectively treat and improve conditions like fine lines and wrinkles, acne and scarring, loose skin, skin texture, pore size, brown spots, stretch marks and pigment issues (like melasma and vitiligo), and on the scalp to promote hair growth. Microneedling creates micro channels in the skin, which stimulates collagen production and increases serum absorption by 3000%! Results are seen and felt after the fist treatment. Research shows maximum results to arrive in 4-6 treatments, and last and average of 5 years. Counseling Each of us is on a unique and fascinating soul journey.
