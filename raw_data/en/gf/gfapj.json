INTRODUCTION In 1933, Rebecca Lance eld changed our understanding of b-hemolytic strepto- cocci by developing a system of serologic classi cation based on the carbohydrate composition of cell wall antigens. Of these organisms, the most signi cant in human pathogenicity is group A Streptococcus (GAS), otherwise known as Streptococcus pyogenes . (1) GAS is responsible for an impressively wide variety of clinical manifestations, from noninvasive infections, such as pharyngitis, scarlet fever, erysipelas, and cellulitis, to invasive disease, including sepsis, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS), and necrotizing fasciitis (Table 1). It has also been linked to multiple nonsuppurative complications including acute rheumatic fever (ARF), poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN), and thecontroversial pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS). Globally, an estimated 18 million people are suffering from a serious GAS-related illness, with about 1.78 million new cases annually. Hundreds of millions of people develop less serious GAS infection everyAUTHOR DISCLOSURE Drs Dietrich and Steele have disclosed no nancial relationships relevant to this article.

ABBREVIATIONS ANF acute necrotizing poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis STSS streptococcal syndrome Vol. 39 No. 8 AUGUST 2018 379year, placing a massive burden on healthcare systems. The complications of GAS infections disproportionately affectthose in low- and middle-income countries. Transmission of GAS is via droplets from those with pharyngeal infection or colonization, direct contact, contaminated fomites, or food- borne contamination. (2)(3) The virulence and range of infection and complications of GAS can be attributed to certain characteristics that this gram-positive bacterium possesses, including cellular con- stituents, extracellular products, and unique autoimmune responses it can produce. Important virulence factors in- clude a hyaluronic acid capsule, which protects GAS from phagocytosis, and the M protein, a surface protein that is usedto dene serotypes of GAS. The M protein also contributes to virulence in many ways, including inhibition of opsonization and phagocytosis, as well as facili tating tissue invasion. Extra- cellular products are numerous and play many different roles, and include the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins. Toxins play a particularly important role in invasive GAS infections like STSS, in which mediation of toxin production with the protein synthesis inhibiting clindamycin is especially important. A particular group of streptococcal toxins, called superantigens , stimulate massive cytokine release, which is responsible for the overwhelming and rapid progression of disease that can beseen in invasive streptococcal i nfections. A protease toxin, SpeB, is also known to play an important role in virulence,implicated as contributing to both super cial and invasive disease. (1)(3)(4) This review covers the major noninvasive and invasive GAS infections and complications in children, and will touch on recent research, including vaccine development and burgeoning resistance. NONINVASIVE GAS INFECTIONS Streptococcal Pharyngitis Pharyngitis accounts for about 6% of all primary care physician visits, and about 40% of children older than 3 years presenting with a complaint of sore throat will test positive for GAS. (5)(6) It occurs most commonly in chil- dren 5 to 15 years of age during winter months. (1) Clinical signs and symptoms in school-age and older children include sore throat, fever, tender anterior cervical adenop- athy, pharyngeal and tonsillar exudate (Fig 1), vomiting, and headache. Younger children and infants, on the other hand, may present with generalized lymphadenopathy, fever, andserous nasal discharge. (7) If GAS pharyngitis is suspected, the diagnostic approach should begin with a rapid antigen detection test in children older than 3 years followed by throat culture in those who test negative. Children younger than 3 years of age are unlikely to manifest ARF, and thus diagnosis and treatment are less important. However, physicians may choose to test children younger than 3 years if risk factors are signi cant, for example, when symptoms are present and the child has a relative with GAS. (8) Culture is not necessary in those who test positive with the antigen test. (9) Multiple clinicalprediction rules are available to aid in the diagnosis of GAS. The Centor criteria, for example, assign a point each to temperatures greater than 101.3\u00b0F (38.5\u00b0C), swollen and tender anterior cervical lymph nodes, tonsillar exudate, and absence of cough. These criteria were tested in studies that showed them to be effective in ruling out GAS phar- yngitis in adult patients with 2 or fewer criteria. These criteria must be used with caution in children, however, because multiple studies have demonstrated the unreliabil-ity of clinically observable signs and symptoms. (5)(10)(11) Unless clinical ndings strongly suggest a viral etiology (conjunctivitis, rhinitis, coryza, rash, cough), throat swab with the rapid test should be used to rule out GAS, and these clinical prediction rules should not be used in isolation. The need to treat all cases of GAS pharyngitis in high- resource settings with low incidence of rheumatic fever is controversial. However, current recommendations in the TABLE 1. Various Infection Types with Group AStreptococcus TYPES OF INFECTION Noninvasive Pharyngitis Otitis mediaSinusitisImpetigo streptococcalinfections 380 Pediatrics in ReviewUnited States are to do so. To prevent rheumatic fever, treatment must be started within 9 days of symptom onset. Preferred oral antibiotic regimen is penicillin V or amoxi-cillin for 10 days. Physicians should note the bene t of once- daily dosing of amoxicillin, which may be preferred. Another option, particular ly in patients who may have difculty reliably taking oral medications, is intramuscular benzathine penicillin G. Procaine penicillin has decreased pain associated with the injection. In penicillin-allergic patients who have not had a systemic anaphylactic reaction, arst-generation cephalosporin is recommended for 10 days. Otherwise, physicians may give clarithromycin orclindamycin for 10 days, or azithromycin for 5 days. (8) Posttreatment throat cultures as proof of cure are unnec- essary unless symptoms persist 2 to 7 days after completion of therapy. (12) Scarlet Fever Scarlet fever, or scarlatina, results from the systemic elab-oration of erythrogenic GAS exotoxins, most commonly in association with GAS pharyngitis but occasionally from skin and skin structure infection. More severe manifestations are less common in areas where antibiotic treatment is readilyavailable. The most characteristic symptom is a rash that typically begins on the upper chest or neck 1 to 2 days after the onset of GAS infection and will spread to the extremities and face. There is diffuse erythema which blanches, with a nely papular \"sandpaper \"texture of the skin (Fig 2), with pinpoint areas of deeper red scattered petechiae that do notblanch, and \"Pastia 's lines \"(Fig 3), which are areas of deeper red in the skin creases. Other ndings include circumoral pallor (Fig 4), strawberry tongue, and later desquamation (Fig 5). (1)(13) Treatment is focused on the underlying bacterial infection that is the nidus of toxin production and the subsequent symptoms of scarlet fever. Acute Rheumatic Fever ARF is an illness that involves multiple organ systems, andis the leading cardiovascular cause of death in children in low-income countries. (12) It has an onset typically 2 to 4 weeks after GAS pharyngitis; other types of GAS infection have not reliably shown an association with ARF, thoughthere is some evidence of its occurrence. (14)(15)(16)(17) ARF is thought to be an autoimmune response via molec- ular mimicry. (18) The link between prior GAS infection and onset of ARF is clear, with the advent of antibiotic treatment for GAS pharyngitis leading to a sharp decline in the incidence of ARF. (19) Diagnosis is made using the Jones criteria, in which 2 major, or 1 major and 2 minor, criteria must be ful lled along with evidence of preceding GAS infection (Table 2). Major criteria are carditis, arthritis,chorea, erythema marginatum (Fig 6), and arthralgia, fever, ele- vated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and prolonged PR interval. In 2015, the American Heart Association updated the Jones criteria, distinguishing between low- and moder- ate- to high-risk populations, and emphasizing the use of echocardiography in diagnosing carditis, and the inclusion of monoarthritis and polyarthralgia as major criteria in moderate- or high- risk populations. A low-risk population is one that has an ARF incidence of less than or equal to 2 per 100,000 school-aged children or all-age rheumatic heartdisease prevalence of less than or equal to 1 per 1,000 population per year. (20) The incidence of primary ARF is greatest in children from 5 to 14 years of age with equal Figure 1. Tonsillar exudate and palatal petechiae in a patient with group AStreptococcus pharyngitis. Figure 2. Diffuse erythematous sandpaper rash of scarlet fever. (74) Vol. 39 No. 8 AUGUST 2018 381distribution between boys and girls, though girls have a greater incidence of associated heart disease. (18) Management of ARF focuses on eradication of GAS along with targeted therapy toward individual manifesta- tions. Echocardiography with Doppler should be performedon initial presentation even in the absence of auscultatory ndings, and serial echocardiography should be strongly considered even if carditis is not present on initial diagno- sis. (20) Carditis is treated with bed rest, fluid restriction, car- diac medications and corticosteroids, (18) though it is unclear whether corticosteroids have a true impact on long-term outcomes. (21) There has been no evidence to demonstrate the ef cacy of immune-modulating m edications such as intra- venous immunoglubulin (IVIG). (22) Arthritis is treated with aspirin at 50 to 70 mg/kg per day tapered over several weeks, (14)(15)(16)(17)(18)(19)(20)(21)(22)(23) though there is someevidence that the naproxen is an effective alternative to control inflammation and pain, and circumvents the rare risk of Reye syndrome. (24)(25)(26) Anti-in flammatory medications should be used with caution, however, before a de nitive diagnosis of ARF is made, because they can mask developing symptoms that may contribute to the diagnosis. Sydenham chorea istypically benign and self-limiting, though it can be severe and onset can be up to months after initial infection. Pharmacologic treatment may be considered in patients with severe symptoms, and may include valproic acid, carbamazepine, and short courses of steroids. (18)(27)(28) Children with a history of ARF are at greater risk of ARF recurrence with subsequent GAS infections and should Figure 3. Pastia 's lines in a patient with scarlet fever. (74) Figure 4. Circumoral pallor and strawberry tongue in a patient with scarlet fever. (74) Figure 5. Desquamation of the ngertips in a patient with scarlet fever; desquamation typically occurs about 7 to 10 days after onset of illness. (74) 382 Pediatrics in Reviewbegin prophylaxis as soon as ARF is diagnosed. Prophy- laxis may be intramuscular benzathine penicillin G once monthly or daily oral penicillin, and for penicillin-allergic patients a macrolide is typically used. Duration of prophy- laxis is 5 years since the last episode of ARF or until 21 years of age in patients who did not have carditis, whichever is later. In patients with carditis who do not have residual heart disease (no valvular disease) duration is 10 years since the last ARF episode, or until 21 years of age, whichever is later. Finally, when there are persistent manifestations of rheu-matic heart disease, penicillin prophylaxis is continued until40 years of age at a minimum, and depending on severity of disease, many clinicians choose to provide prophylaxis for life. (12)(29) Impetigo Impetigo is an extremely common super cial infection of the skin described either as bullous or nonbullous. Bullous lesions are much more likely to be caused by Staphylococcus aureus with strains that commonly elaborate an erythrogenic toxin, whereas nonbullous impetigo may result from eitherGAS or S aureus . (30) From the 1950s through the 1970s, GAS was a more common cause of impetigo than S aureus , but since that time S aureus has become more common, accounting for more than 80% of these skin infections today. This change in etiology accounts for the decreased incidence of acute glomerulonephritis in children. Appear- ance of the lesion is not suf cient to identify the responsible organism; thus, if bacterial identi cation is desired, culture is necessary. The infection is most common in children 2 to 5 years of age, though it can occur in any age. (30) Non- bullous impetigo typically manifests in exposed areas, suchas the face and limbs. It is characterized by erythematous papules, which evolve to vesicles that rapidly rupture to form characteristic \"honey-colored \"exudate and thick crusts (Fig 7). (31) For more localized lesions, treatment consists of topical mupirocin or retapumulin. For more extensive or multiple TABLE 2. Revised Jones Criteria for ARF from 2015 American Heart Association Statement (20) Diagnosis of initial ARF requires 2 major criteria, or 1 major plus 2 minor criteria. Diagnosis of recurrent ARF requires 2 major criteria, or 1 major plus 2 minor criteria, or 3 minor criteria.

Figure 6. Erythema marginatum in a patient with acute rheumatic fever. This rash is characterized by nonpruritic, mildly raised ringlike erythema with central clearing. Although present in only a minority of cases of rheumatic fever, this nding is considered a major Jones criterion. (74) Vol. 39 No. 8 AUGUST 2018 383lesions, oral therapy may be considered. Cephalexin, a rst- generation cephalosporin, will effectively treat GAS andmethicillin-susceptible S aureus (MSSA). Physicians should be aware of the prevalence of methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) in their communities, and if it is suspected, con- sider clindamycin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for oral therapy in more severe cases. (32)(33)(34) Although impetigo is a self-limited disease, treatment can shorten the time to resolution, and thus decrease spread of the infection. Culture of the lesion to identify the offending organism can be helpful, but it is also appropriate to empirically treat most cases without performing a culture. Children with impetigo should be withheld from school ordaycare for 24 hours after the initiation of treatment. Erysipelas and Cellulitis Impetigo is an infection of the epidermis, erysipelas is aninfection of the deeper dermis, and cellulitis involves the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. These latter infections are caused primarily by GAS, though they can also result from infections with group C or G streptococci, group Bstreptococci, or less commonly S aureus . (31)(34)(35)(36) Skin lesions such as eczema, chickenpox, or lacerationscan become secondarily infected with GAS (impetiginized) leading to an abscess with surrounding cellulitis termed pyoderma . Erysipelas presents as a raised, painful skin erythema with distinct borders, most often on the face or extremities (Fig 8). Frequently lymphatic involvement is seen with erythematous streaking termed Cel- lulitis presents as edema and erythema that is not sharply demarcated, but also with tenderness, pain, and warmth. (31) Presence of a purulent lesion is less common with GAS and should raise suspicion for S aureus . Treatment for erysipelas and cellulitis without purulent lesions and with- out systemic signs of infection should target streptococci, and many clinicians choose to include coverage against MSSA as well. For erysipelas, which is almost always caused byb-hemolytic streptococci, clinicians may treat with pen- icillin or amoxicillin. In cases in which it may be more difcult to distinguish between erysipelas and cellulitis and when MSSA is a consideration, for outpatient therapy a rst- generation cephalosporin, such as cephalexin, or clindamy-cin is appropriate. Treatment for uncomplicated erysipelas and cellulitis is typically for 5 days. For more severe infec- tions with systemic symptoms, evidence of MRSA infection elsewhere, history of penetrating trauma, or known MRSA nasal colonization, coverage against both MRSA and strep- tococci is recommended. Parenteral treatment should be considered for very young children; rapidly progressing erysipelas or cellulitis; large areas of involvement; involve- ment of the face, neck, or genitals; and children who have systemic symptoms, including fever and tachycardia. (1)(31) (34) Vulvovaginitis and Perianal Cellulitis Vulvovaginitis is the most common gynecologic complaint in the prepubescent girl treated by the primary care physi- cian. Typically, a child with GAS vulvovaginitis will present with vulvar pain or itching, spotting of serous to purulent discharge on the underwear, and vulvar erythema. Perianal cellulitis with GAS presents as a sharply demarcated peria- nal erythema that is often painful and pruritic. Althoughmost cultures of vulvovaginitis in prepubertal girls are polymicrobial, the most consistent agent identi ed is GAS. (37)(38)(39)(40) Unlike other organisms found on cul- tures from patients with vulvovaginitis, GAS is not con- sidered normal vaginal bacterial flora. (41) Several reports have linked GAS vulvovaginitis to a previous pharyngeal infection or colonization with the organism, though this is not required for diagnosis. (42) Although some clinicians Figure 7. Impetigo with characteristic honey-colored exudate and thick crusts. (74) 384 Pediatrics in Reviewdo use rapid antigen diagnostic tests for diagnosing vulvo- vaginitis or perianal cellulitis, these assays have not been validated for genital infections. Etiologic diagnosis is best achieved via culture from a vaginal or perianal swab. The recommended treatment of GAS vulvovaginitis and peria-nal cellulitis is a 10-day course of amoxicillin; for the penicillin-allergic child, clarithromycin has been described. (41)(43)(44) If vulvovaginitis is recurrent, one should con- sider testing the child for pharyngeal carrier status and decolonizing. Evidence to dictate a preferred regimen is not suf cient; thus, decolonizing protocols for pharyngeal carriage may be considered (see section on \"Carrier State \"). Although 1 study demonstrated promising results for recur- rent vulvovaginitis using topical localized treatment, this approach has not been adequately studied. (45) Poststreptococcal Glomerulonephritis Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) is a nonsup- purative and after streptococcal infection, most commonly GAS impetigo. It can range from asymptom- atic to severe with subsequent renal failure, though most cases in children have few long-term complications. PSGN has anonset 2 to 4 weeks after infection in the skin and 7 to 10 days after streptococcal pharyngitis . PSGN will usually manifest as an acute nephritic syndrome, though it can also cause nephrotic syndrome, and more rarely, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. Presenting symptoms include hematuria, which may be microscopic or macroscopic, proteinuria, hyper- tension, and edema. Laboratory studies will typically be sig- nicant for evidence of a past streptococcal infection with positive ASO or anti-DNAse B antibody titers, as well as low levels of complement C3. At diagnosis of PSGN, if the GAS infection is still present, it sh ould be treated with appropriate antibiotics. Treatment of PSGN is typically supportive in nature and depends on clinical presenta tion, but may include antihy- pertensive medications, sodium and fluid restrictions, steroid administration and, if necessary, dialysis. It is important to note that treating streptococcal infections may not prevent PSGN, but importantly, will prevent nephritogenic strains of PSGN f r o ms p r e a d i n gt of a m i l ym e m b e r sa n do t h e rc o n t a c t s .( 4 6 ) ( 4 7 ) Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated With Streptococcal Infections Under the umbrella of obsessive compulsive and tic disor- ders is the subtype pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome, which falls within PANDAS. (48) The de ning symptoms, pathophysiology, and treatment of this condition have been controversial since the diagnosis was rst sug- gested. In general, an abrupt onset of obsessive-compulsive behaviors, tics, choreiform movements, and various behav- ioral manifestations characterize the disorder. (49) PANDAS must be preceded by a proven streptococcal infection with positive ASO or anti-DNAseB antibody titers and occurs typically within a few days to weeks after infection. A leading hypothesis of etiology is autoimmune, with possible basalganglia antigens as targets. (50) Evidence for the management of suspected PANDAS is not robust. Typically, management includes psychiatric treatments focusing on symptoms of obsessive-compulsive behaviors, tics, and behavioral manifestations. Children with active GAS pharyngitis should be treated appropri- ately, and prophylactic penicillin for children with frequent PANDAS exacerbations should be considered; studies for the latter have shown mixed results. (50) A recent 2015 studydemonstrated a non -statistically signi cant improvement in tic symptoms with a 30-day course of cefdinir after a recent onset of obsessive-compulsive disorder or tics. (51) Case reports have documented improvement of PANDAS after tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy, but a large study by Murphy et al did not demonstrate a difference in children who did and did not undergo the procedure. (52) Some studies have indicated a possible bene t of plasma exchange Figure 8. Erysipelas on the face of a young child. Note the distinct, raised borders of the lesion.

(56) INVASIVE GAS INFECTIONS In invasive GAS infections, the organism is found in typically sterile sites such as blood, joint fluid, or cerebrospinal fluid.Based on surveillance data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between 2005 and 2012, between 1,136 and 1,607 deaths occurred per year in both adults and children in the United States secondary to invasive GAS.Among children, peak incidence occurs before 2 years of age. Invasive GAS occurs more frequently in winter and early spring. (57) Although the spectrum of invasive GAS is wide, for the purposes of this review, we will focus on 2 presen- tations that are important for the general pediatrician to quickly recognize: STSS and acute necrotizing fasciitis.

(34) Vol. 39 No. 8 AUGUST 2018 387Streptococcal Toxic Shock Syndrome STSS consists of infection with GAS accompanied by hypo- tension and evidence of multiorgan failure. STSS is usuallypreceded by skin or soft tissue infections with GAS, but can be seen with GAS infection at any site. In STSS, super- antigen toxins trigger massive T-cell proliferation and a subsequent \"cytokine storm. \"(58) The patient may present initially with fevers and a generalized erythroderma and then progress to develop hypotension and multiorgan fail- ure. The pillars of treatment for STSS are aggressive man- agement of shock and organ failure, antibiotic therapy, and consideration of IVIG administration. If soft tissue involve-ment is noted, including necrotizing fasciitis, emergent surgical evaluation is warranted. (29) Antibiotic treatment is dual, with a b-lactamase -resistant b-lactam, such as a penicillin/penicillinase-inhibitor combination or carbape- nem, as well as clindamycin, which serves to reduce the production of superantigens by GAS. (58)(59) In addition, if staphylococcal infection cannot be ruled out, vancomycin should be added to the empiric therapy regimen. Multiple studies, including several observational studies (59)(60)(61) and 1 small, randomized control trial, (62) indicate that IVIG as an adjunctive therapy may decrease mortality inSTSS. Use of IVIG is still in debate, however, and individual clinical judgment is appropriate. If IVIG is given, an accept- able dosing regimen is 1 g/kg on day 1, followed by 0.5 g/kg on days 2 and 3. (29) In the United States, there is currently no recommendation to provide chemoprophylaxis to close contacts. Acute Necrotizing Fasciitis Type II acute necrotizing fasciitis (ANF) is an aggressive,rapidly progressing deep tissue infection caused by GAS, usually alone, but to a lesser extent in combination with S aureus or anaerobes. ANF accounted for 7% of all cases of invasive GAS infections in the United States between 2005 and 2012, with just less than 1% presenting with combined ANF and STSS. Mortality for all cases of ANF was 20%, though this was much lower in the pediatric population. (57) Mortality of combined ANF and STSS is much higher, with some estimates as high as 60%. (63) ANF will typically begin as an apparently innocuous lesion that may be accom- panied by pain that is out of proportion with the examination ndings. Infants may have profound irritability. Children may also present fever, tachycardia, leukocytosis, phosphokinase, hypoalbuminemia, hypocal- cemia, and evidence of coagulopathy. Within 24 to 72 hours, there is a rapid progression to more pronounced in flam- mation, followed by purplish discoloration of the skin, evolving into hemorrhagic or serous bullae. Over the nextfew days, the involved tissue, which may go as deep as muscle, will become frankly necrotic. The most importantstep in halting the progression of the necrosis is surgical debridement, which should not be delayed for further diagnostics if the suspicion for ANF is high. Magnetic resonance imaging may be helpful in the diagnosis but cannot rule out ANF; although gas visualized in the tissues is a classic nding in ANF, often all that is seen is localized tissue swelling. Antibiotic therapy is the same as in STSS: dual therapy with a b-lactamase -resistant b-lactam antimi- crobial combined with clindamycin to mediate GAS toxin, with the addition of vancomycin until MRSA can be ruled out. (29)(63)(64) A recent large study in adults demon-strated no bene t of IVIG in mortality or length of hospital stay in patients with ANF who had undergone surgical debridement and received antibiotic therapy. (65) CONCLUSIONS Vaccination Currently there is no commercially available GAS vaccine, though it has been widely pursued and was included as oneof the priorities in the 2014 Global Vaccine Action Plan. There have been many roadblocks in nding a successful vaccine, including the large diversity of strains of GAS. Chiefly, vaccine developers have been targeting the M surface protein, but a recent approach has also used strep- tococcal pyrogenic exotoxins A and B (66) as well as another antigen, M-related protein, in the already existing multi- valent M protein vaccines. (67) A phase 1 trial is being conducted of a 30-valent M protein vaccine in adults. (68) The governments of Australia and New Zealand, coun- tries which harbor particularly high incidence of GAS-related disease, especially i n indigenous populations, came together in 2014 to develop a Coalition to Advance New Vaccinations against group A Streptococcus (CANVAS). (69) Evolving Resistance of GAS Practitioners should be cognizant of the evolving resistancepatterns of GAS to antibiotics other than penicillin. Several recent publications note fairly signi cant resistance to mac- rolides and clindamycin. One such study in Wisconsin demonstrated resistance to azithromycin in 15% of isolates from primary care clinics. (70)(71)(72) This emphasizes the importance of penicillins as the preferred antimicrobial and should be avoided only in de nite penicillin allergy. In strep- tococcal pharyngitis, azithro mycin may be used, but culture sensitivities should be obtained to ensure susceptibility. In addition, in invasive GAS, clindamycin should not be used 388 Pediatrics in Reviewalone but in combination with a b-lactam because 4% to 8% of GAS strains are resistant to clindamycin. Carrier State Children harboring GAS in the pharynx without clinical symptoms of disease are said to be carriers. A meta-analysis in 2010 estimated the prevalence of GAS carriage at about 12%. (6) GAS carriers are typically not infectious and the colonizing bacteria are less virulent. Colonized GAS is unlikely to become pathologic in the host or result in non- suppurative complications. In general, antibiotic therapy is not recommended to eradicate the carrier state. Thus, if a throat swab is positive for GAS, but the patient lackssymptoms of streptococcal pha ryngitis, treatment is not recommended. In the same vein, \"p r o o fo fc u r e \"after treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis is not recommended unless symptoms persist. Eradication may be considered in select situations, such as a community outbreak of PSGN or ARF, or a family history of ARF. Antibiotic options for eradication include 10 days of clindamycin, penicillin and rifampin, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. (12)(29)(73) Prophylaxis The only indication for GAS prophylaxis with robust evi- dence is for ARF and may consist of monthly intramuscu- lar benzathine penicillin G or daily oral penicillin, or for penicillin-allergic patients, sul soxazole or a macrolide (see section on ARF for more details). (12)(29) Some clinicians may choose to provide prophylaxis to certain high-risk close contacts of patients with invasive GAS disease. These include people who are 65 years of age or older, those who are immunocompromised (eg, human immunode ciency virus -positive individuals), or those with diabetes mellitus. Prophylaxis is not recommended in schools or child-care facilities. (29) Prophylaxis may consist of benzathine peni- cillin G, clindamycin, or azithromycin. (76) Finally, some physicians may choose to provide penicillin prophylaxis to patients with frequent PANDAS exacerbations; this decisionshould be made on a case-by-case basis because the evidence is not robust.

Summary \u0081Group A Streptococcus (GAS) infections are highly prevalent, and account for major morbidity and mortality worldwide, from both primary infections and subsequent complications. \u0081On the basis of strong research evidence, all children older than 3 years who present with pharyngitis without features that strongly suggest a viral etiology should undergo testing for GAS pharyngitis, with negative rapid antigen detection tests followedby a throat swab culture. Posttreatment diagnostics are not recommended. (8) \u0081Diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) should be made using the updated 2015 Jones criteria, which now include separatecriteria for low- and moderate- to high-risk populations. Based on research evidence and consensus, echocardiography should be performed in all cases of suspected or con rmed ARF, even in the absence of auscultatory ndings. (20) On the basis of strong research evidence, prophylaxis is recommended for patients with well-documented histories of rheumatic fever. (12) \u0081Based on strong research evidence, topical therapy with mupirocin or retapamulin is appropriate for localized impetigo,whereas numerous lesions or an outbreak situation should be treated with oral therapy. On the basis of research and observational studies, treatment of cellulitis without systemicinvolvement should target streptococci. On the basis of consensus, physicians may choose to treat cellulitis with systemic symptoms with an agent that covers methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus. (34) \u0081On the basis of expert consensus and observational studies, antimicrobial choice for acute necrotizing fasciitis should include ab-lactam antibiotic with clindamycin to mediate toxin GAS toxin. Vancomycin should also be added initially to covermethicillin-resistant S aureus until cultures are complete.
