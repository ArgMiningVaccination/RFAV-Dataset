Dr. Fejerman is a prominent cancer disparities researcher who led the first genome-wide association study of breast cancer in Latinas that successfully identified a genetic variant of Indigenous American ancestry, which decreases the probability of developing breast cancer. Her groundbreaking work in this area has begun to bring insight into risk factors involved in breast cancer disparities. Dr. Fejerman is an Associate Professor in Residence in the Department of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. Her research focuses on the discovery of genetic and non-genetic factors that contribute to breast cancer risk and prognosis in Latinas, including recent work exploring disparities in breast cancer prognosis by genetic ancestry in Latinas and its potential causes. Dr. Fejerman's past work established a relationship between genetic ancestry and breast cancer risk, where higher European ancestry in U.S. and Mexican Latinas was associated with an increased risk. Her subsequent research built upon this observation. She has explored risk through the exploration of genetic variants, admixture mapping, and genome-wide association approaches and through the investigation of environmental and lifestyle-related factors along with ancestry-gene interactions. Dr. Fejerman earned her PhD in biological anthropology and MSc in human biology at the University of Oxford, England. She completed her undergraduate degree in social anthropology at the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Laundette P. Jones, PhD, received an R01 from the NCI in 2011 and a Workforce Diversity Award (R21) in 2012 that focused on understanding how breast cancer develops. Through her research, Dr. Jones made significant contributions toward understanding how the combination of genetic and environmental risk factors impacts the evolution of breast cancer. This includes understanding novel gene-environment paradigm of breast cancer etiology, namely whether BReast CAncer gene 1 (BRCA1) deficiency is associated with an increased sensitivity to the prevalent environmental estrogen, Bisphenol A (BPA). Today, as an established transdisciplinary scientist, Dr. Jones continues to pioneer advancement in our understanding of the complex interplay between environmental and genetic factors contributing to cancer health disparities. Dr. Jones is an Assistant Professor in the Departments of Epidemiology & Public Health and Pharmacology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Dr. Jones' research investigates how changes in endogenous and exogenous hormonal/environmental factors contribute to breast tumorigenesis. She collaborates with transdisciplinary research teams and communities to understand how the interplay between biological, environmental, social, and behavioral factors leads to cancer health disparities. Dr. Jones received a BS in chemistry from Morgan State University and a PhD in environmental health sciences from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. She completed two postdoctoral fellowships: in the NCI Laboratory of Experimental Carcinogenesis, she investigated DNA-damaging effects of chemicals in cooked meats on the mammary gland, and in the Tumor Biology program at Georgetown University, she utilized genetically engineered mouse models for preclinical breast cancer to understand mechanisms of BRCA1 tumorigenesis.
