Guided Imagery Guided imagery teaches you how to use all five senses and your imagination to visualize a more relaxed and peaceful state of being. This technique can be used during procedures, treatments, and surgery to help ease anxiety. Hypnosis Hypnosis triggers a deeply relaxed and highly focused state of concentration and attention that helps people cope with the physical and emotional components of pain.

We can also teach you methods of self-hypnosis. The 'M' Technique The 'M' Technique\u00ae is a gentle method of structured touch that works on skin receptors to promote relaxation and restful sleep. The 'M' Technique\u00ae is suitable for the very young, older adults, and critically ill or dying patients. Because the technique is completely choreographed, it is easily taught to caregivers to use with their loved ones. Mindfulness Meditation Mindfulness meditation uses the breath to focus your mind, reduce stress, and control emotions. You learn to become aware of your thoughts and feelings, reducing your reactions to them and heling you become less judgmental. This has been found to assist physical and emotional healing. Meditation is used for a variety of conditions such as anxiety, pain, stress, insomnia, and physical and emotional symptoms that accompany chronic illnesses such as [heart disease](/conditions/coronary-artery-disease-in-adults) and cancer. Progressive Muscle Relaxation Progressive muscle relaxation is achieved through either a muscle tightening and relaxation exercise, or with focused awareness on each part of the body. Relaxation techniques have been found to help ease a variety of conditions including insomnia, anxiety, and headaches, as well as the symptoms associated with [fibromyalgia](/conditions/fibromyalgia-in-adults), irritable bowel syndrome, and heart disease. Reiki Reiki is an ancient, gentle, noninvasive, hands-on technique that facilitates deep relaxation. The practitioner places her or his hands on or close to your body in a series of positions. The goal is to release the flow of energy through your body. Practitioners believe this promotes the body's ability to heal itself, ease pain, lessen muscle tension, and relieve insomnia. Relaxation Breathing Gentle, focused breathing teaches you to use your breath to relax your body and mind. This reduces the harmful effects of stress. Therapeutic Touch Therapeutic Touch\u00ae is an evidenced-based energy therapy that is used to promote balance and wellbeing. Direct touch is not necessary for the treatment but may be used. "}
