The Office of Biological and Environmental Research ( BER ), a program office in DOE 's Office of Science, initiated support for researcher access to major user facilities for structural biology in 1990, when DOE was engaged in a similar program for constructing and upgrading these facilities. That initiative was focused on DOE synchrotron light sources and neutron beam facilities.The workshop took place May 9-11 in Rockville, Maryland. Two months before the meeting, leaders from each of the five facilities submitted papers describing the facilities and potential applications in biology (these papers are included in Appendices A-E of this report). A panel of experts in the design, operation, and management of these facilities, as well as in several key nonfacility technologies used in biological research and in major areas of biology supported by BER, read these reports prior to the meeting (see Appendix F for participants list). At the meeting, the entire panel separately heard presentations from and engaged in discussions with representatives of each facility and then developed outlines for the chapters of this report. The Executive Summary and the five chapters were prepared after the meeting by panel members and circulated to the entire panel for comments and editing prior to completion of the report. BER appreciates the involvement of all panel members, especially the co-chairs, Dagmar Ringe of Brandeis University and David Eisenberg of the University of California-Los Angeles. The appendices describing the five facilities were prepared by staff of the respective national laboratories. In some cases, comments from panel members led to revisions of a paper; however, the final version included in this report represents the views of the national laboratory, not the panel members. The efforts of national laboratory staff members to prepare their papers are very much appreciated. All of the written materials in this report were edited and prepared for publication by members of the Biological and Environmental Research Information System group at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. BER is indebted to the members of this group who devoted extensive time and much thought to preparation of all report components for publication. Comments on this report will be welcomed by Roland Hirsch and Susan Gregurick, the BER program managers involved in the workshop.PrefaceU.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Researchiv v U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Executive Summary .................................................................................................................................................... vii C hapter 1.

Biological ques-tions that can only be addressed using high-intensity photon and neutron beams are now being explored. Particle accelerators developed over decades of research in high-energy physics have led to synchrotron light sources that offer very intense beams with tunable energies. Important contributions to the current understanding of a cell's biologi-cal infrastructure and the chemistry underpinning cellular function are based on results from experiments conducted at these synchrotrons. An estimated 30% to 40% of light source users are from the biological sciences, and Nobel Prizes awarded in 1997, 2003, 2006, and 2009 recognized biochemical discoveries enabled by light sources. In fact, the biology community probably rep - resents the largest single user group, even though synchrotron facilities in the United States generally were developed to sup - port research in a variety of other fields, particularly materials science, geoscience, chemistry, and nanoscience. In the United States, large scientific user facilities relevant to biological science are supported by many federal and state agencies. This report concerns facilities funded by the Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Science, which develops and operates the largest base of national user facili-ties in the country. Within the Office of Science, the Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research supports several of the world's fastest leadership computing facilities, with significant applications in biological science. The Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES) maintains 17 user facilities including synchrotron radiation light sources, high-flux neu-tron sources, electron beam microcharacterization centers, and nanoscale science research centers. BES facilities enable progress in many scientific and technological disciplines and are used by more than 14,000 researchers annually. The Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER) operates three major user facilities (the Atmospheric Radia-tion Measurement Climate Research Facility, the Environ-mental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, and the DOE Joint Genome Institute) that serve more than 3,000 users annually. The Offices of Fusion Energy Sciences, High Energy Physics, and Nuclear Physics also operate key facilities for research in physics that, in some cases, also have applications in the life sciences (for example, experiments for development of particle beam therapies). BER has played a major role in enabling new capabilities for biological research at existing Office of Science facilities. The primary focus of BER's Structural Biology activity is to sup-port specialized instrumentation for biology at synchrotron light sources and neutron facilities. The light sources produce intense beams of x-rays and other wavelengths extending into the infrared to terahertz region, while particle accelerators and nuclear reactors produce neutron beams. These beams are directed into experimental stations housing instruments configured for specific biological investigations. This infra-structure provides user access to beamline instrumentation for studies of biological organisms and molecules in all areas of life science research. BER has supported development and operation of many of the instruments at the facilities, in close coordination with counterpart programs at other agencies and in the private sector. These research facilities enable scientific studies aimed at understanding the structure and properties of matter at the atomic, molecular, and cellular levels, experiments not pos-sible with instrumentation available in university, institute, or industrial laboratories. Several major techniques play a dominant role in structural biology: macromolecular crystal-lography, scattering from noncrystalline and semicrystal-line materials, x-ray spectroscopy, and imaging using x-rays or other parts of the spectrum. Each of the five facilities described in this report will offer advanced capabilities for these techniques. Experimental results from such facilities have become critical parts of many investigations into the properties of biological systems from the molecular to cellular level. Facility use has become so important and wide-spread in biology that support staff have been specifically designated to assist novice users in accessing these resources. Facility capabilities are essential for studies at the frontiers of science as well as for industrial research and development. T ransfer of the knowledge gained from basic biological research at these facilities often leads to advances in industry and commerce. For example, the pharmaceutical industry has benefitted from these facilities in developing cancer treat-ments (including a recent therapy for melanomas) and new drugs for combating infections such as HIV . Collaboration viii U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Executive Summarybetween facilities and scientific users ultimately benefits both. Continued involvement of academic scientists work-ing at DOE national user facilities ensures develop me nt of advanced methods, and ongoing facility access allows new scientists to be trained in the design and building of new instrumentation. In fact, the training of new scientists famil-iar with the potential of these facilities is essential for future cutting-edge science in biology and all other fields. New Capabilities for Biological Research With recent advances in synchrotron physics and advanced laboratory automation, national user facilities can now be upgraded to investigate new frontiers of biology. Planning for such enhan c ements thus is timely. Indeed, recent upgrades to European and Japanese synchrotrons are attracting some American investigators to compete for time on these remote facilities to perform advanced experiments not yet possible in the United States. The Office of Science has a long-term plan for development of new or upgraded national user facilities with capabilities beyond those currently delivered. Two such facilities with important implications for biological science recently began full operation, and three others are in various stages of con-struction or planning: A dvanced Photon Source Upgrade (APS-U) at Argonne National Laboratory \u2014 planning stage. L inac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory \u2014 operating. N ational Synchrotron Light Source-II (NSLS-II) at Brookhaven National Laboratory \u2014 under construction, with full opera t ions expected to begin in 2015. N ext Generation Light Source (NGLS) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory \u2014 planning stage. Sp allation Neutron Source (SNS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory \u2014 operating. T o identify the new experimental capabilities that these facilities will provide and assess their potential impact on biological research, BER convened the Applications of New DOE National User Facilities in Biology community workshop from May 9-11, 2011, in Rockville, Maryland. The workshop was co-chaired by David Eisenberg (University of California, Los Angeles) and Dagmar Ringe (Brandeis University) and included a panel of experts in biological research enabled by synchrotron light sources, neutron facilities, and free-electron lasers, as well as in other types of key instrumentation used in biological research (see Appendix F for the workshop agenda and a list of partici - pants). Scientists from each of the national laboratories prepared preworkshop papers about the new facilities (see Appendices A-E) and made presentations and engaged in discussions with panel members during the meeting. The panel then wrote chapters describing each facility and its potential for supporting high-impact biology. The following brief summaries capture the key points in the five chapters. Advanced Photon Source Upgrade APS, the largest synchrotron facility in the United States, runs an extremely successful user program, especially for structural biology. It is the only U.S. light source that can provide high-energy x-ray undulator radiation now and in the near future. APS has been in operation for more than 10 years, and the timely upgrade will allow major advances in synchrotron technology to be integrated into existing or new beamlines. The upgraded facility will provide x-rays with the highest flux and brightness at energies above about 10 and 20 kiloelectron volts (keV), respectively. Such capabilities will be achieved through long, straight sections; revolver and superconduct - ing undulators; higher electron current; and improved beam stability. Novel \"crab cavities\" will enable 1 picosecond pulses in time-resolved experiments. Complementing the machine upgrade is a forefront instrumenta t ion and beamline develop - ment program for ultrafast, high-energy imaging, and in situ studies. The proposed beamline and instrument upgrades build on world-leading programs and fully exploit unique APS properties. Importantly, in view of APS's pivotal role in academic and industrial structural biology, machines will be upgraded with minimal loss of operating hours for ongoing programs. Two infrastructure projects\u2014an automated crys - tallization facility and the Cryo Sample Preparation Facility\u2014will meet the increasingly important need for onsite sample preparation in biological research. In summary, the proposed upgrade program is essential for restoring APS as a leading synchrotron source among new and recently upgraded facili - ties with significant impacts in biology. Linac Coherent Light Source LCLS is the world's first x-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) user facility. The machine produces extremely bright x-ray pulses as short as 10 femtoseconds over the energy range of ~500 to 10,000 eV with ~10 12 photons per pulse. LCLS is capable of producing x-ray pulses of the highest energy of any XFEL worldwide. Five of the six planned multidisciplinary experi - mental stations are open to the user community and have produced exciting results; the sixth (Matter in Extreme Condi - tions) is in commissioning and will begin serving users in May 2012. The initial success of experiments on femtosecond nanocrystallography at LCLS has generated great excitement among structural biologists. Structure determination is based on collection of thousands of femtosecond x-ray diffraction snapshots collected on a stream of nanocrystals by femtosec - ond pulses. As diffraction is recorded in femtoseconds before the sample is destroyed, this method (1) overcomes the radia - tion damage problem in x-ray crystallography, (2) enables data collection on crystals that contain less than 1,000 unit cells, U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research ix Executive Summary(3) allows data collection at room temperature, and (4) may open the way for a new era of x-ray crystallography from nano - crystals. The first time-resolved femtosecond crystallography experiments indicate that LCLS will enable the determination of time-resolved x-ray data that could lead to molecular movies of biomolecules at work on a subpicosecond time scale. Early results from coherent x-ray imaging of single virus particles indicate that single particles can be imaged at LCLS and that the higher peak brilliance of the facility's planned expansion (LCLS-II) may extend single-particle analysis to atomic resolution. Plans for L CLS-II, to be completed in 2018, include increasing the peak brilliance of x-ray pulses, extending the energies accessible to a range from 200 eV to 20 keV , and sup - porting up to six simultaneous experiments. LCLS holds great potential for enabling researchers to obtain high-resolution structural data from biological samples free of radiation dam-age. Realizing this exciting promise will require further devel - opment of new detectors, rapid and low-consumption sample delivery techniques, and improved data analysis methods. National Synchrotron Light Source-II Currently under construction, NSLS-II is set to begin opera- tions in 2014. This synchrotron radiation source, located near the original NSLS, will accommodate at least 58 beamlines covering a wide range of disciplines, including the life sci-ences. Completely new, NSLS-II will deliver an extremely bright beam from the far infrared to the very hard x-ray region. By providing the world's brightest light source x-ray beams ranging from 2 to 10 keV , NSLS-II will be uniquely positioned to provide capabilities in this energy range, such as bright coherent beams for imaging and spectroscopy. For higher-energy x-rays, NSLS-II will be comparable to the best light sources. This facility will open new frontiers in photon sciences and engender development of new instruments and techniques to exploit fully its beam characteristics with cutting-edge projects such as a 1 nm hard x-ray nanoprobe. Planned biological beamlines at NSLS-II encompass mac-romolecular crystallography, scattering, spectroscopy, and imaging, ensuring that NSLS-II will play a major role in future biological research. In addition, the NSLS-II design includes a Biology Village or community of highly integrated groups working in different but related areas of the life sciences. This Village will provide a unified and synergistic environment for life science experiments and change the way researchers interact and work at a synchrotron radiation user facility. NSLS-II promises to be an outstanding source for many new types of experiments in various disciplines and will help the U.S. maintain a strong leadership position in synchrotron-based biological research. Next Generation Light Source NGLS is a new facility in the early stages of planning (antici - pated first light is in 2022). With an array of 10 independently configurable XFELs powered by a superconducting linear accelerator, NGLS will be capable of delivering ultrafast, high-brightness, and high-resolution pulses of low-energy x-rays at high repetition rates. Each of these features distinguishes NGLS from any existing synchrotron or XFEL and contrib - utes to its currently envisaged suite of transformative scientific capabilities for biology. For example, macromolecules, molecular assemblies, organelles, and cells will be imaged in real time and in real biological contexts. Individual biologi - cal objects will be imaged, rather than averaged over a large sample, to enable new understanding of the role of biological heterogeneity. Selective enhancement of scattering from specific chemical groups will permit simultaneous investiga - tions of the structure and chemistry of molecular systems in solution. Additional powerful applications undoubtedly will emerge once this unique light source comes online. Spallation Neutron Source SNS approached its designed operational capability about a year ago, becoming one of the world's two most powerful sources for investigating the structure and dynamics of bio - molecular systems by elastic and inelastic neutron scattering. Isotopic substitution, specifically deuterium for hydrogen in the case of biological systems, coupled with contrast matching of selected components, provides a distinct advantage for these neutron-scattering techniques. This method can reveal key aspects of structure and dynamics over a wide range of length and time scales within complex macromolecular systems. Although important for studying biological macro - molecules in single crystals, these techniques are essential for investigating more complex, noncrystalline systems, including multicomponent macromolecular assemblies in solution and liquid-crystalline membranes. Two important upgrades have been proposed and built into the SNS design. One would expand the proton accelerator's power, increasing by two to three times the flux of spallation-produced neutrons. This increase is highly significant because most neutron-scattering experiments are \"flux-starved\" (i.e., limited only by the avail - able neutron flux). The other upgrade would add a second target station optimized for producing longer-wavelength \"cold\" neutrons important for structural studies of large macromolecular systems at longer length scales. This upgrade also will provide much needed additional capacity, including instruments optimized for studying biological systems. The Path Forward This workshop report describes in detail these five major national user facilities and identifies their potential for sig-nificant impacts on biological research. The facilities\u2014which have begun initial operations or are expected to move from planning to upgraded or new construction in the coming decade\u2014will support a wide range of biological experi-ments. Such experiments include those that can be planned now and others that can be planned only after capabilities of the new facilities emerge. These facilities are expected to offer x U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Executive Summarynew technologies that will advance not only biology, but also many other disciplines such as chemistry, geology, physics, and materials science. For optimal service to the scientific community, the facilities also must consider the collateral needs of users. Of paramount importance will be development of a new generation of detectors, as well as advanced approaches for specimen mounting, preservation, and changing, including robotic devices for high-throughput applications. These capabilities will maximize the output of the experimental stations at the facilities. Advances in technology and methods for data processing and storage will be critical, and adequate plans to recruit, house, and train new users are essential. By focusing on the present and potential future capabilities of the five facilities, this report seeks to increase awareness of them among scientists in all areas of biology and related disciplines. Informing researchers about such capabilities and how they can be used to advance individual research is a challenge for each facility.1 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Chapter 1. Advanced Photon Source Upgradeadvanced PhoTon source uPgrade Brief Facility Description As the largest synchrotron facility in the United States, the Advanced Photon Source ( APS ) at A rgonne National Laboratory runs an extremely successful user program, serving almost 3,800 researchers in 2010. APS generates synchrotron radiation of unrivaled brightness and is the only U.S. light source that can provide high-energy x-ray undulator radiation now and in the near future. The facility has contributed to numerous scientific advances, particularly in structural biology. This success is demonstrated by the impact of APS -enabled insights into, for example, ribosome structures and G protein-coupled receptors, as well as the number of publications and Protein Data Bank depositions resulting from APS work. Protein crystallography with picosecond temporal resolution was pioneered at APS and the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, and the introduction of microprotein crystallogra - phy and related beamline instrumentation and automation was paramount in several high-profile projects. More recently, APS provision of micrometer-sized beams enabled the demonstration of their radiation damage-mitigating properties. The elemental and chemical specificity of x-ray fluorescence and microprobe x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy has been established in microscopy and tomography techniques at APS and successfully applied to biological research, environmental studies, and the imag - ing of nanoparticles. The current APS beam size is about 200 nanometers (nm), and studies are carried out mainly on freeze-dried samples in two dimensions. Recently, the first three-dimensional ( 3 D) distribution maps of trace ele- ments in a freshwater diatom were determined in a ground - breaking experiment. An upgrade of the APS (in operation for more than 10 years) is timely and will allow major advances in the field to be integrated into existing or new beamlines. The upgraded facility will provide x-rays with the highest flux and bright - ness at energies above 10 and 20 kiloelectron volts ( keV), respectively. Such capabilities will be achieved through long straight sections; revolver and superconducting undula - tors; higher electron current; and improved beam stability. Novel \"crab cavities\" will enable 1 picosecond pulses in time-resolved experiments. The machine upgrade is complemented by a forefront instrumentation and beamline development program for ultrafast, high-energy, imaging, and in situ studies. Importantly, in view of APS 's pivotal role in academic and industrial structural biology, the machine upgrade will be realized with minimal loss of operating hours to ongoing programs. The proposed upgrade is essen-tial for restoring APS as a leading synchrotron source among new and recently upgraded facilities. Facility Capabilities and Potential for High-Impact Experiments The APS Upgrade ( APS-U ) has two scientific themes: (1) Mastering hierarchical structures through imaging and (2) Real materials under real conditions in real time. As part of the overall scientific strategy for the upgrade, the APS Scien - tific Advisory Committee strongly endorsed proposals for new biology facilities. These proposals include a new beam-line for microfocus protein crystallography, a new x-ray fluo-rescence microscope (BioNanoprobe II), a new beamline for small- and wide-angle x-ray scattering, and two infrastructure projects focused on sample preparation. These life science beamlines and infrastructure projects are not included in the scope of APS-U (funded by the DOE Office of Basic Energy Sciences) and hence will require separate funding. Microfocus Macromolecular Crystallography Beamline macromolecular crystallography ( MX). Facilities around the world are scrambling to meet user demand by develop in g new microbeamlines, which require an order-of-magnitude greater precision in beam delivery and sample positioning than conventional beamlines. The proposed microfocus beamline will complete APS's MX beamline portfolio. By providing the highest-energy microfocus beam for MX in the world, this beamline will take full advantage of APS's unique source properties and complement the planned microfocus beamline at the National Synchrotron Light Source-II Laboratory. microbeams enable improved signal-to-noise and, when combined with microcrystals, offer Chapter 12 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Chapter 1. Advanced Photon Source Upgradethe largest potential to reduce radiation damage to samples. With appropriate infrastructure, software, and support (see following sections), this beamline will enable data collection from crystals currently discarded as too small or imperfect, thereby reducing the need for time-consuming crystal opti-mization to avoid complete failure of structure solution. The new beamline will complement existing MX microbeams at APS and other microfocus beams under development, adding capacity to meet the strong and rapidly growing demand for dedicated microcrystallography facilities. APS's importance for the U.S. structural biology community cannot be overestimated. NSLS-II construction is currently ahead of schedule, and early access to some beamlines will be available in 2014. However, other beamlines will not be available until 2015 or 2016, and the facility's full capacity may not be reached until 2017. Thus, both the APS-U project and continued availability of APS beamlines operating at the highest performance level are of great importance. Further-more, APS and NSLS-II have complementary energy spectra, and, for x-ray energies above ~13 ke V, APS will remain the nation's highest-flux synchrotron source even after NSLS-II is operational. For these reasons, the workshop panel endorses implementing the upgrade over 6 years with minimal instru-ment downtime for users. BioNanoprobe II: An X-Ray Fluorescence Microscope A second topic highlighted in the APS-U presentation is the use of nanofocused beams to perform x-ray fluorescence microscopy ( XFM ). The proposed BioNanoprobe II will offer a spatial resolution of 20 nm and improve elemental sensitivity by two orders of magnitude over current levels. Importantly, the high energy of APS will be fully exploited to probe all relevant absorption edges with high flux (5 to 30 ke V). These higher energies also will be beneficial for studying thick or highly absorbing samples, both in the bio-logical sciences and in the geosciences. The microscope will be operated in-vacuum, and samples will be held at cryogenic temperatures to minimize photoreduction and structural changes. It also will offer correlative optical cryomicroscopy (e.g., for complementary visualization of fluorophores). Dose fractionation enabled by simultaneous phase-contrast imag-ing is an important development to shorten exposure times and reduce radiation damage. Moreover, 3D reconstruction of the sample structure from the phase-contrast signal signifi-cantly facilitates interpretation of the spatial distribution of trace elements. BioNanoprobe II will provide unique imaging capabilities for biological, biomedical, and environmental studies. It addresses the current gap in resolution between optical microscopies and electron microscopy and offers elemental and chemical specificity on thicker samples. The instrument's impact will be limited only by its throughput. Achieving the highest possible throughput will be critically important because studies of genetically modified bacteria or cells require the measurement of a large number of samples to be conclusive. SAXS and WAXS Beamline Solution small-angle x-ray scattering ( SAXS ) has become an important method in structural biology. SAXS provides information complementary to data obtained with protein crystallography (e.g., the stoichiometry of large complexes and the conformational dynamics of proteins and complexes in solution). This technique also is useful if samples cannot be crystallized or for verifying that the crystal structure corresponds to the solution structure. Although SAXS can provide the molecular envelope of a sample, wide-angle x-ray scattering ( WAXS ) is more sensitive on shorter distances. Combined with computational simulations, they can reveal conformational changes and dynamic processes. A fully automated SAXS and WAXS beamline is proposed with an additional grazing incidence SAXS (GISAXS ) capability. APS lacks a dedicated beamline for biological solution scattering, so the SAXS and WAXS beam would be a central element of a comprehensive suite of instruments for biological research. Infrastructure for Improved Sample Preparation Two infrastructure projects will complement the proposed life science beamlines and greatly benefit biological research at APS: (1) an automated crystallization facility and (2) the Cryo Sample Preparation Facility. The suggested XFM studies of frozen hydrated biological samples rely on state-of-the-art freezing protocols. Current vitrification techniques for protein crystals frequently compromise crystal quality, but optimized protocols may result in samples that are less mosaical and thus able to produce higher-resolution diffrac-tion. Because crystallization and cryofreezing are subsequent steps in sample preparation and to foster interdisciplinary exchange, the workshop panel recommends that the two facilities work in close synergy and, if possible, as one unit. The crystallization facility, housed in a building adjacent to APS that will be funded by the state of Illinois, should be connected as intimately as possible to the beamline facilities. This would enable a fully automated process of crystalliza-tion and crystal screening, followed by x-ray data collection, ideally under \"native\" crystallization conditions. Such a facil-ity would have the greatest scientific impact if the research community could access its automated, robotic technology in a variety of ways. For example, researchers could bring samples for crystallization and then take the resulting crystals for analysis to any APS beamline instead of simply submitting a sample at one end and obtaining a structure from the other.3 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Chapter 1. Advanced Photon Source UpgradeSpecial Capabilities and Ancillary Facilities for Biology Protein microcrystallography relies heavily on optimal sam- ple visualization and adequate beamline automation. T o this end, implementation of an advanced optical or x-ray method should be investigated. Such methods include, for example, the newly developed SONICC (second-order nonlinear optical imaging of chiral crystals) technology or x-ray tomog-raphy. Beamline automation should make any manual sample alignment unnecessary. Since the scattering of micrometer-sized crystals is extremely weak, low-background mounting techniques and a helium sample environment need to be considered to minimize background. Current detectors for MX are optimized to energies around 12 keV , and fully exploiting the potential of hard x-ray microbeams for reduc-ing radiation damage will require the ability to optimize detectors accordingly. Moreover, software for merging multicrystal datasets will be needed to solve structures from microcrystals. Synergies with work done in the context of nanocrystallography at XFEL facilities should be exploited. Finally, optimal use of the automated crystallization facility should include the possibility of in situ diffraction screening and room-temperature data collection. Raman, fluorescence, and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy can provide specific chemical information that typically can-not be inferred from electron density alone. Moreover, radia-tion damage may alter oxidation states and binding length. Thus, the installation of multimode spectrometers at APS's MX beamlines would significantly extend their capabilities. X-ray fluorescence microscopy and tomography are scan-ning techniques and hence very slow compared to full-field techniques. High throughput and sensitivity completely rely on optimized detectors currently unavailable at APS. Since detector development requires substantial resources, a joint program should be considered that includes detector groups at different laboratories and, ideally, industrial partners. Likewise, an industrial partnership is encouraged for further development of the BioNanoprobe end station. Implementation of an automated crystallization facility and Cryo Sample Preparation Facility is strongly supported. These facilities should be operated as general user facilities accessible during all stages of the user projects. T o maxi-mize their impact, the facilities need to make user training and education integral parts of their operation. In fact, the workshop panel suggests that APS go a step further by implementing a support laboratory for biological research. This \"biology village\"\u2014similar to a concept planned for NSLS-II \u2014would be important for fostering multitechnique and multilength-scale approaches. As biological research becomes increasingly specialized and as newer, more power-ful techniques emerge for application to biological problems, providing this type of support to biologists unfamiliar with such techniques will be important. This laboratory thus would be instrumental in ensuring that a broad audience can use the tools and that their scientific potential is known to the wider biomedical community. As techniques become more powerful, such facilities will help develop new biologi-cal applications, even among regular users. With increasingly sophisticated beamline instrumentation and progressively shorter runs, thorough user training is of utmost importance for efficient facility use. In addition, the crystallization facility could be an ideal platform for an APS in situ diffraction capa- bility that allows recording of diffraction data directly from protein crystals in their growth environment. Currently no central depository for x-ray fluorescence microscopy maps and tomograms exists. This hampers the development of the field because neither methods develop-ers nor biologists can easily access recent results. In view of the anticipated rapid growth of XFM , implementing a database similar to Protein Data Bank or gene data banks would be timely. Similarly, a central repository of software for data collection and postcollection image preparation would facilitate more rapid development of the community. Support for Users, Existing Beamlines Regular beamline access by users is key in MX but requires a high staffing level to cope with shorter individual runs. Although automation and remote access alleviate the problem with respect to scientific staff, significantly more technicians and engineers are needed to guarantee high avail-ability of these services. Specific concerns involve the level of support for XFM data analysis and the availability of analysis software offsite for external users. As the upgrade takes place, support for existing beamlines will be needed to adapt optics and front ends to the higher power and power density delivered by APS. An essential part of APS-U will be to ensure APS's many current beamlines are fully operational when the upgrade is completed.4 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research5 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Chapter 2. Linac Coherent Light SourceBrief Facility Description The Linac Coherent Light Source ( LCLS ) at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory is the first operational hard x-ray free-electron laser ( XFEL ). Using the last kilometer of linear accel - erator (or linac), LCLS accelerates electrons and passes them through up to 112 m of undulators. These electrons initiate the self-amplified spontaneous emission ( SASE ) laser process. LCLS has six end stations for experiments in a variety of science areas (see T able 2.1 for key facility para me ters). Sum- maries of LCLS (e.g., Boutet and Williams 2010; Emma et al. 2010) include a description by Galayda et al. (2010) that places the facility in a historical and projected worldwide context. Specific LCLS characteristics enabling new types of synchrotron radiation experiments are the spatially coherent, exceedingly intense x-ray pulses (>10 12 photons/pulse) in very short time inter - vals of <100 femtoseconds (f s ). These intense, short pulses can provide useful x-ray signals that probe specimens on time scales far faster than typical atomic motions. When focused to micron diameters, the x-ray pulses are intense enough to turn all matter into plasma. However, in many cases, the scattered x-rays have escaped the specimen before the sample suffers atomic dis - placements, thereby enabling so-called \"diffract before destroy\" methods. This capa b ility opens new oppor tunit ies in structural biology for nanocrystal - lography (Chapman et al. 2011), single-particle structural methods (Neutze et al. 2000; Seibert et al. 2011), and correlation solution scattering (Kam 1977). If the beam is expanded over larger areas, the specific peak power per unit area is reduced in proportion. Thus, beams spanning several hundred microns allow samples to survive but still are able to probe on subpicosecond time scales, a capability that offers new applications in biological pump-probe crystallography (Schotte et al. 2003). In addition, the very fast time scales Table 2.1 Summary of Key LCLS Parameters Symbol Hard X-Rays Soft X-Rays Unit Photon beam parameters Fundamental wavelength r 1.4 17 \u00c5 Photon energy 9,000 750 to 2,000 eV Final linac e energy mc214.2 4.1 GeV FEL 3D gain length LG 3.3 1.5 m Photons per pulse N 2 20 1012 Peak brightness Bpk 20 0.3 1032 a Average brightness (30 Hz) B 40 2 1020 a Photon bandwidth / ~0.2 ~0.4 % Bunch charge Q 0.25 0.25 nC Final pulse duration (FWHM) f 80 240 fs Electron beam parameters Single bunch repetition rate F 120 120 Hz e energy stability (rms) E/E 0.04 0.07 % e x, y stability (rms) x/ x 15, 10 25, 20 % e timing stability (rms) t 50 n/a fs Peak current stability (rms) I/I 10 6 % Charge stability (rms) Q/Q 2.5 2.5 % FEL pulse energy stability N/N J.

Linac Coherent Light SourcePhoton Energy (keV)LCLS-II hard x-ray seeded LCLS-II soft x-ray present new oppor tunit ies in time-resolved biological soft and hard x-ray spectroscopies. Frontier experi me nts at the now operational LCLS are investigating the feasibility of these novel methods. The availability of the remaining two-thirds of the SLAC linac opens new and exciting possi b ilities for a second set of free-electron laser stations (see Fig. 2.1, this page). Many of these capabilities (e.g., hard x-ray seeding1) have yet to be demonstrated. Indeed, an important use of LCLS facilities, as the first hard XFEL in the world, is to explore the feasibil- ity of new methods and capabilities, both for biology and many other science areas. Although other XFEL s will begin operation in the coming years (Galayda et al. 2010), LCLS has a special obligation as the first hard x-ray laser to continue being very open-minded about biological experiments with low initial feasibility but potentially big payoffs if successful. It may seem strange to say this at this time, but there is a distinct danger that a few highly successful experiments will displace more speculative experiments. Researchers will con-tinue to devise ideas for novel types of experiments, and thus the workshop panel believes LCLS should remain a facility for exploring such experiments and conducting proof-of-concept work. This would help ensure that a few successful experiments not displace newer, more speculative types of research. T o meet this challenge, facility management must be strict and transparent about the procedure for selecting and prioritizing experiments. Beam time at LCLS is highly competitive, and experiments frequently will involve untested and difficult experimental equipment. The presence of the Stanford Synchrotron Radia - tion Lightsource ( SSRL ) on the SLAC site can be beneficial in allowing users to set up experiments that can be partially debugged at SSRL and then quickly installed at LCLS . In at least the short term, LCLS will not be a production facility because it can accommodate only a very limited number of experiments. If very successful, LCLS may help justify con- struction of additional XFEL s, but LCLS itself will not be able to accommodate more than a limited number of experiments. For this reason, traditional synchrotron sources will remain the workhorses for many different types of experiments. Facility Capabilities and Potential for High-Impact Experiments X-ray laser beams, such as those at LCLS , offer three unique features that cannot be realized by storage ring-based x-ray light sources: E xtremely high peak brightness, currently at ~1012 photons/pulse at 8 ke V (more than four orders of mag- nitude brighter than any storage ring-based x-ray source). U ltrashort x-ray pulses down to <10 fs (more than a factor of 1,000 shorter than those from storage ring-based sources). N early complete spatial coherence of x-rays (in contrast to the small coherence fraction of storage ring sources). These new features have the potential to revolutionarily impact biology, not only by extending the capabilities of existing technology, but also by opening up outstanding new research oppor tunit ies. Success of the highest-impact experiments by no means is assured, and con sid e rable research will be required to test the feasibility of many experiments. In this respect, the x-ray laser is a \"sandbox\" for future biology research. LCLS covers a wide variety of experimental methods, includ- ing diffraction, sca tt e r in g, and spectroscopy. The planned experiments are at many stages of develop me nt, from \"nearly ready for broad use\" to \"in the feasibility sandbox\" , with ________________ 1LCLS and other XFELs operate by the self-amplified spontaneous emission process (i.e., x-ray pulses arise from random fluctuations in microbunches). Consequently, each laser pulse is a statis t ical collection of micropulses that varies slightly from one another, leading to lots of pulse-to-pulse varia t ion. In theory, the process could be made more coherent by \"seeding\" the pulse with a pre-existing \"weak\" x-ray pulse fed into the undulator. The new pulse then grows coherently around this seed pulse. This technique has been demonstrated at long x-ray wavelengths but not yet at short ones, which place far more stringent constraints on the process.Fig. 2.1.

[Courtesy of SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory]7 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Chapter 2. Linac Coherent Light Sourcemacromolecular crystallography being the most certain experiment during this initial stage of LCLS . Nanocrystallography X-ray laser pulses of extremely high flux and short duration enable nano cr ystal lo gr aphy, and recent publication of the first feasibility results at LCLS generated great excitement in this community (Chapman et al. 2011). In nanocrystallogra-phy, data are collected on nanocrystals containing only 100 to 10,000 molecules, avoiding the need for growing large single crystals. Each randomly oriented nanocrystal diffracts x-rays from one pulse of the XFEL . Nanocrystallography may enable structure determination of biologically important samples (e.g., membrane proteins and large protein complexes) that cannot be examined with crystallography using conventional synchrotron radiation because of the difficulty in obtaining crystals of sufficient size. Enabling broad use of nanocrystal-lography will require systematic studies on methods to grow and deliver nanocrystals of suitable diffraction quality and to reduce tens of thousands of single-pulse diffraction images to full diffraction datasets. ultrashort x-ray pulses for these types of experi- ments also has great potential to impact biology research. Time-resolved crystallography on a time scale of femtosec-onds would reveal the correlated molecular motions of the chemical processes of enzyme catalysis. The principle of \"dif-fract before destroy\" allows collection of virtually damage-free data, thereby overcoming the problem of x-ray damage in crystallography. Damage-free, atomic-resolution structures would describe an enzyme reaction in unprecedented detail, potentially having significant impact in biochemistry. Con-siderable development of better ways for very quick initiation of the chemical process under study would be required to take advantage of this method. Coherent X-Ray Imaging (CXI) and Correlated X-Ray Scattering (CXS) Studies exploiting the spatial coherence of LCLS x-rays have the potential for a very high impact and are true sandbox experiments because, prior to LCLS , existing x-ray sources could provide only a low flux of coherent x-rays. The capabil-ity for single-molecule structure determination (i.e., CXI) is among the most remark a ble and exciting experiments for an XFEL . Unlike in conventional crystallography, resolution in single-particle experiments does not depend on the quality of a bulk sample but rather is a function of beam intensity, pulse duration, wavelength, and the sample's scattering power. The first biological CXI experiment targeted the mimivirus and demonstrated LCLS 's potential for scattering experiments on biological samples (Seibert et al. 2011); no other research facility in the world currently offers compa-rable capabilities. Three-dimensional (3D) imaging (i.e., tomography) is key to evolving CXI into a widely used structure analysis method. A 3D dataset must be assembled from many diffraction patterns recorded when numerous copies of a reproducible sample are exposed to the beam one by one in random orientations (Huldt, Szoke, and Hajdu 2003; Bortel and Faigel 2007). Determination of molecular orientation and nonreproduc-ible samples will be challenges for CXI experiments, as will be competition from cryo-electron microscopy. CXS is another unique experiment exploiting the coherence of extremely brilliant x-ray pulses. CXS has the potential for time-resolved or static exploration of 3D structures of bio - lo gical macromolecules in solution and should provide much more information about molecular structure than conven-tional small-angle x-ray scattering. X-Ray Spectroscopy X-ray spectroscopy experiments also will take advantage of the ultrashort x-ray pulses at LCLS . Time-resolved spectros- copy of biological processes is important in monitoring, for example, the chemical reaction of enzymes. X-ray spectros-copy can be used in combination with crystallography to determine the chemical states of metal centers or color pig-ments involved in catalysis, and room-temperature spectros-copy and crystallography enable light-induced \"snapshot\" time-dependent studies. Future x-ray laser beams\u2014never used prior to LCLS opera- tion\u2014have numerous capabilities and potential. In addition to the previously outlined experiments, LCLS and its planned expansion ( LCLS-II ) will be pioneers for discovering innova- tive technologies and methods beyond the expectations envi-sioned for x-ray lasers. T o fully exploit x-ray lasers for biology, more beamlines and beam time will be needed. LCLS-II is an excellent start in this direction, particularly if emphasis is placed on the higher-energy x-rays (>10 ke V) needed for most of the described experi me nts. Special Capabilities and Ancillary Facilities for Biology The unique LCLS beams enable many novel and important biological experiments. However, any successful experiment requires more than just the appropriate x-ray beams (e.g., upstream XFEL and x-ray optics). Also needed are (1) meth- ods to prepare and deliver specimens into the beam, (2) in situ probes (e.g., lasers for pump probe and simultaneous spectroscopy probes), (3) suitable detectors to capture x-ray signals, and (4) advanced methods to handle and analyze resultant data. In many biologically important experiments, 8 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Chapter 2. Linac Coherent Light Sourcethese nonbeam factors will be very challenging and certainly rate limiting in terms of delivering scientific results. Only representative exam p les of such factors can be given in this short report, and specifying detailed future needs in the rapidly evolving XFEL field is premature. However, support for ancil l ary equipment and methods research and development (R&D ) clearly is essential if LCLS 's biological promise is to be realized. The model in which university groups develop experiments and experimental equip me nt has been successful at LCLS . Development within the universities builds robust connec-tions, trains the next generation of instrument scientists, and vastly increases the human capital available to develop new ideas. This has been true in such areas as equipment for specimen handling and in situ specimen assays, novel detec-tors, and data handling and analysis. Specimen-Handling Methods Both offline and online specimen handling are critical for bio - logical experiments at LCLS . Offline considerations include standard equipment as well as R&D . Biological materials fre- quently require standard wet-lab capabilities and equipment currently not at the SLAC site. The needed wet-lab capabilities should be provided without presenting R&D challenges. By contrast, much R&D is needed to learn how to prepare specimens for the unique requirements of LCLS experiments. For example, recent LCLS nanocrystallography experiments were enabled by the development of offline second harmonic microscopy [second-order nonlinear optical imaging of chir al crystals ( SONICC ); Wampler et al. 2008]. This technique helped identify materials as crystalline, even if the crystals were too small to be optically resolved. Online methods R&D also will be required. For example, nanocrystallography experiments to date have relied on the development of novel fluid jet methods to deliver nanocrystals into the x-ray beam (Weierstall et al. 2007). This method needs further develop - ment to enable wider use, and other methods should be investigated also. In Situ Probes The means to prepare and probe the state of samples will be of utmost importance. For example, time-resolved \"movies\" of protein structure (Schotte et al. 2003) typically require both in situ lasers to pump the protein process and, ideally, in situ optical methods to monitor the spectroscopic state of crystals. Detectors Perhaps the single most important lesson from the last two decades of biological research at synchrotrons is that better x-ray detectors are needed to take full advantage of x-ray sources. Aside from the development of synchrotron radia-tion sources themselves, no other ancillary equipment has been as rate limiting\u2014or as important in increasing scientific results\u2014as advanced x-ray detectors. XFEL detectors will need capabilities considerably beyond the current state of the art, requiring a consistent long-term program of advanced R&D . In the past, the development of synchrotron x-ray detectors was greatly facilitated by the fact that many beam-lines at different synchrotrons could use the same detector for crystallography, thereby making detector development attractive to commercial firms. This is less likely to be the case for XFEL detectors because they will need to be tailored for the specific needs of each XFEL experiment and thus will not enjoy a mass market. In this sense, XFEL detector R&D will be much more like R&D for other parts of the XFEL . This situation presents special challenges because development of new detectors is very expensive and takes many years for each new detector. Nonetheless, without several parallel detector R&D projects, LCLS simply will be unable to realize its promise. A second lesson from the last few decades is that successful detector development is limited when confined to Depart-ment of Energy laboratories. As in the past, future success will require R&D wherever detector expertise exists, whether in national laboratories, industry, or academe. Data Handling and Analysis Procedures Typical LCLS experiments each deliver terabytes of data. R&D is needed to establish better methods for handling and analyzing these huge volumes of data. Novel procedures will be required to analyze, for example, images from single protein molecules that will be severely Poisson noise limited. Although research has shown that this is not an insur moun table obstacle in principle (Elser 2009; Elser and Eisebitt 2011; Loh et al. 2010), much work remains to be done on practical methods for reducing large datasets so that structures can be obtained. Collaborations with the electron microscopy ( EM) community, which has considerable exper- tise in determining molecular orientation from noisy images, could be highly beneficial. At some point, experiments at LCLS and other XFEL s will transition from isolated demon- strations of feasibility to more routine delivery of structural or other services. This transition will require reduction of data at the point of generation (i.e., via the use of smart detectors and online computational procedures). Support for Personnel to Enable Collaboration Between X-Ray Experts, Biologists LCLS has enormous promise to produce biological results of great impact. New experimental methodologies are needed to test the feasibility of the boldest LCLS experiments and enable the facility to reach its full potential for all biological experiments. These methodologies lie at the interface of the x-ray source and the sample, thus requiring collaboration between LCLS scientists and biological researchers. However, 9 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Chapter 2. Linac Coherent Light Sourcea mismatch of knowledge exists between these two commu- nities because experts in each field need a better understand-ing of the other. X-ray physicists and engineers with expertise in the production, delivery, and properties of LCLS 's pulsed, coherent, and brilliant beams are not steeped in the complex-ities and subtleties of biological systems, nor are they up to date with the constantly evolving understanding of biological processes. Conversely, the most challenging and significant problems in structural biology require careful target selection and involve samples that are extremely difficult to produce. Very few researchers who are adept at project development and sample preparation also have expertise in x-ray physics at the level required to develop experiments at LCLS . The knowledge and training gap exists for many scientific com-munities who will use LCLS but is perhaps widest and most critical in biology. One approach to addressing this gap would be to identify \"glue\" personnel from each community and embed them in the other, perhaps in a minisabbatical format. Another approach would be to convince groups with adequate expertise to participate in experiments, for example, by inviting more experienced crystallography and EM group leaders to visit and discuss new experiments. This would address the current challenge of making more people aware of LCLS and its capabilities. \"Gap\" or \"glue\" personnel will be needed to support biolo-gists using LCLS even after new experimental methodolo- gies are established. The success of this approach is evident at SSRL , where a large and highly effective support staff has streamlined crystallography beamline use, leading to major biological results from true biologist users in contrast to past biophysicist users. The proximity of SSRL is a great advantage for LCLS , offering a good opportunity to develop staff exper- tise in bio lo gical experiments and user support.10 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Chapter 2.

National Synchrotron Light Source-IIBrief Facility Description The National Synchrotron Light Source-II ( NSLS-II ) is a new synchrotron radiation source still under con- struction and planned to come online in March 2014. It is located at Brookhaven National Laboratory ( BNL ) on Long Island, New Y ork, near the original NSLS synchrotron radiation source. NSLS-II is a large 3 gigaelectron volt ( GeV) ring of 791.5 m in circumference, which will accommodate at least 58 beamlines including 27 insertion devices and 27 bend - ing magnet lines. NSLS-II is not just an upgrade to NSLS ; it is a completely new source. It will deliver an extremely bright beam (>1021 ph/mm2/mrad2/0.1% BW) in the 2 to 10 ke V range, approach in g a fully coherent, diffraction-limited source in the vertical plane. In addition, NSLS-II will have a very wide spectral range, from the far infrared (0.1 me V) to the very hard x-ray region (100 ke V). In the medium term, NSLS-II will deliver the brightest low-energy x-ray beams in the world and will surpass other sources, such as the Advanced Photon Source ( APS), in the 2 to 10 ke V range. For higher-energy x-rays, NSLS-II will be comparable to many other sources. This suggests that NSLS-II will be in a unique position to dominate the low-energy x-ray range while still being a major player at higher energies. NSLS-II promises to be an outstanding source for many new types of experiments in a wide range of disci - plines, including life sciences. NSLS-II will provide many new capabilities useful for Department of Energy ( DOE ) Office of Science research programs. Allocation of all NSLS-II beamlines is still in progress. Initial construction plans include six insertion device lines, and over 30 more are in the approval process. Final approval will require identification of funding sources. Of the six initial lines, all of them funded by the DOE Office of Basic Energy Sciences, none are intended for biological sciences. Of the proposed beamlines, 11 have a biological science emphasis and are in the approval process; four more proposals are at the Letter of Intent stage. All these beamlines span a large cross-section of modern synchrotron-based biological research and include beamlines devoted to imaging, crystal-lography, spectroscopy, and scattering. This heavy involve-ment of the biological sciences community in NSLS-II reflects the wide interest in the capabilities that will be afforded by the new source.NSLS-II plans include a Biology Village, or a community of highly integrated groups working in different but related areas in life sciences. As such, the Biology Village will play a role in bringing together all the different biological sciences present at NSLS-II , thus ensuring synergy and interconnec- tion. The village will also ensure that experimenters have easy access to many different but complementary techniques available either at the biology beamlines or in the associated laboratories and will make researchers aware of the different experimental tools available to answer their particular bio-logical question. Initial plans call for many of the beamlines with a biological focus to be in close physical proximity. In addition, planned laboratory space in the Laboratory Office Buildings will also bring life scientists together. Nevertheless, due to different constraints, the Biology Village may largely operate as a virtual one, which is not the most ideal situation. The concept of the Biology Village is very interesting and exciting and promises to change the way life scientists inter-act and work at a synchrotron radiation user facility. This is true not only for the life scientists at NSLS and BNL , but also for outside users and collaborators. It is thus very important to continue to elaborate and solidify the concept of the Biol-ogy Village and to strive to maintain physical connectivity among life scientists. In addition, it will be very important to plan for adequate laboratory space in support of both long- and short-term collaborative projects and guarantee a healthy involvement of the user community in NSLS-II and any future developments. Facility Capabilities and Potential for High-Impact Experiments NSLS-II is still at the construction stage, so it is not possible to gauge fully its capabilities. Nevertheless, it is possible to anticipate areas where its designed capabilities potentially will have a large impact. As mentioned before, these areas encompass macromolecular crystallography ( MX), scat- tering, spectroscopy, and imaging. Beamlines in all these areas are part of the current building and planning process, and additional beamlines also are being considered. The beamlines represent a healthy mix of established techniques, such as MX, and less developed areas, such as coherent x-ray diffraction. In terms of its unique capabilities, NSLS-II is APS FacilitynaTional synchro Tron ligh T source -IIChapter 312 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Chapter 3. National Synchrotron Light Source-IIdesigned to be the synchrotron radiation source with the highest average spectral brightness in the world in the 2 to 10 ke V range. At 8 ke V, NSLS-II will be an order of magnitude brighter than APS. This will have a major impact on tech- niques requiring a high coherent flux, such as coherent x-ray diffraction imaging ( CXDI ). At much higher energies NSLS-II brightness will still be considerable but not as high as that of APS. In addition, NSLS-II is designed to have excellent energy resolution and very high beam stability, making it an ideal source for scattering, imaging, and spectroscopy experiments including nanobeam techniques. Macromolecular Crystallography MX will be very well represented at NSLS-II . There are several beamlines planned, including one in \"frontier MX,\" one for correlated spectroscopy and diffraction, and one for microdiffraction led by the New Y ork Structural Biology Consortium. In addition, plans for a low-energy anomalous x-ray diffraction beamline would strongly enhance the cohort of crystallography beamlines. This last beamline would be a very welcome addition, as it would take full advantage of the unique characteristics of NSLS-II and provide access to energies rarely used in anomalous x-ray scattering experi-ments due to the lack of facilities that can access low-energy x-rays at an adequate brightness. The planned beamline correlating MX with a variety of spectroscopic techniques will provide exciting complementary local information on protein structure and dynamics. Standardized online micro-spectrometry should, however, become optionally available on all MX beamlines. The use of microbeams (<100 m2) is starting to revolutionize some MX experiments because these very small beams permit collection from very small crystals or very small areas of larger crystals. These emerging crystallography approaches will allow reaching the smallest crystal volumes and establishing fruitful collaborations with the upcoming generation of x-ray free-electron laser ( XFEL ) sources. NSLS-II will provide microbeam capabilities in several beamlines. This characteristic, together with planned automation and other developments, will make the MX facili - ties extremely competitive and likely to be in large demand, particularly with users in the surrounding area. The planned MX beamlines are all well designed and likely to make NSLS-II a major hub for structural biology. Imaging Imaging is another area that will take full advantage of NSLS-II capabilities. NSLS-II will be ideally suited for x-ray fluorescence imaging of many elements difficult or impos - sible to access at other facilities. In addition, the beam characteristics will make it very well suited for microprobe imaging and CXDI . Thus, it will be possible to image at the nanometer scale using a variety of techniques to study different levels of organization and correlate this informa - tion with that from, for example, atomic-level elemental analyses. For instance, ptychography promises to provide images of whole cells or organelles at nanometer resolution. In addition, fluorescence imaging of specific elements will help map their location in biological materials at nanometer resolution, thus providing information on the spatial distri - bution of key elements (e.g., carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur) for biological function. Spectroscopy The characteristics of NSLS-II make it an excellent source for spectroscopy studies. Plans for beamlines dedicated to x-ray absorption infrared spectroscopy ensure that NSLS-II will have a strong presence in this area. NSLS-II will provide access to a wide energy spectrum, making it possible to access the very low energy (infrared) spectrum. The advanced infrared microspectroscopy ( AIM ) beamline will provide unique capabilities for vibrational spectroscopy imaging at the submicron level. Finally, the ability to com-bine spectroscopic techniques with other approaches is likely to have a very high impact, as it will provide information on important biological processes by a variety of complemen-tary techniques. For example, the ability to collect not only diffraction data but also near-simultaneous spectroscopic information is likely to have an enormous impact on mecha-nistic studies of enzymes and other important biological molecules. Scattering Finally, several planned beamlines for scattering studies will exploit the exceptional brilliance and beam stability of NSLS-II . Indeed, in recent years, small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS ) has resurged as an important tool that provides low-resolution information on complex biological systems. The plans for an automated solution SAXS beamline are excellent, as it will ensure fast and easy access to a technique rapidly growing in popularity. In addition, other planned beamlines will ensure that NSLS-II stays at the forefront in this area. There is likely to be an increasing demand for solu-tion scattering experiments in the coming years that, when combined with other imaging techniques, promise to provide nanometer-scale information on complex and relatively large macromolecular complexes. Nevertheless, to stay competitive, a strong R&D effort will have to be maintained to integrate the rapid advances in microfluidics technology for sample preparation and delivery, particularly for time-resolved SAXS studies. Ultrasmall sample volumes will also require exploring microbeam and possibly nanobeam SAXS probes. Special Capabilities and Ancillary Facilities for Biology The Biology Village may be the key to the success of NSLS-II as a major hub for biological studies. The village promises to provide a unified and synergistic environment for life science 13 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Chapter 3. National Synchrotron Light Source-IIexperiments. For this reason, it will be extremely important to ensure the success of the Biology Village. The village is likely to be most successful if it goes beyond a virtual one and instead forms a real community that physically brings together the equipment and personnel needed to conduct successful, multidisciplinary experiments. Successful biologi-cal experiments depend on more than just access to state-of-the-art facilities; they also require excellent onsite support for preparing materials needed for experiments as well as tools for characterizing samples before and after experiments at the synchrotron. While many experiments can be done by simply bringing the specimens to the synchrotron, many others are time sensitive and will require preparation onsite. It is thus very important that both BNL and outside users of NSLS-II have access to offices and laboratories to prepare for their experiments. Current plans call for 120 offices, confer-ence rooms, and 10 laboratories for user support at NSLS-II , with additional laboratory space in the NSLS building. It is not clear how much of this space will be devoted to biology, but, given the strong need for onsite sample preparation for some experiments, it is important that sufficient space be allocated for biological laboratories. In addition, the ability to provide space for outside users engaged in long-term experi-ments may also be beneficial. The exact configuration of the laboratory space is very important to ensure success of the village concept, but the characteristics of this space should be determined by local users, keeping in mind the need of both outside and local users and the importance of maximizing collaboration and synergy. All of these features ideally should be contained in the Biology Village. The advent of XFEL s will have an impact on synchrotron radiation sources, but for many types of experiments, synchrotron radiation sources will continue to dominate and be essential because they provide higher beam stabil-ity and access to higher energies. In addition, the \"diffract and destroy\" limitation of XFEL s means that certain types of experiments, such as those that probe the evolution of parameters in time or across a heterogeneous sample, will continue to be more suitable for synchrotron radiation sources. Moreover, phasing by anomalous dispersion will remain a mainstay of synchrotron radiation sources and an area in which NSLS-II is likely to play a very important role. Overall, while XFEL s are likely to engender new and powerful techniques for studying biological samples, they will not replace or supplant synchrotron radiation sources such as NSLS-II in the near or medium future. The characteristics of NSLS-II make it ideal for experiments using very small beams. Beamlines are planned with beams down to micron-level sizes. This is an artificial limit not dictated by instrumental limitations. For many experiments, even smaller beams (nanometer-scale sizes) would be ideal, especially if they are coupled with sample manipulation and positioning instrumentation congruent with the ultrasmall beam sizes. Nanobeams have potentially groundbreaking applications in biological SAXS , CXDI , and MX. Active R&D in this area is important and desirable, and the aim of reaching a 1 nanometer focal spot at the hard x-ray nanoprobe is a well-chosen challenge for NSLS-II . The success of many synchrotron-based biological experi- ments depends largely on the ability to preserve the samples and minimize radiation damage. NSLS-II will be an extremely bright synchrotron, and some of the problems with radiation damage may be exacerbated. For this reason, it is extremely important to have an active R&D program for sample preser- vation and preparation and assessment of radiation damage, with suitable experimental facilities for these tasks. Existing detectors and detector technology very likely will not be optimized for the new generation of synchrotron radiation sources, including NSLS-II . For this reason, striving for a leadership position in detector R&D is important. It is unlikely that one type of detector will be ideal for the many different experiments and beamlines planned at NSLS-II , and thus it may be necessary to build specialized detectors for different applications. T o satisfy many applications, future detectors will need to have low noise, small pixel size, and high readout speeds. Whereas some areas, such as x-ray crys-tallography and SAXS , are large enough to attract the interest of detector development companies, others are more special-ized and likely will require in-house detector developments or partnerships with academic groups. Detectors are likely to continue to be major impediments to many experiments, and hence it is important to have a strong presence in this area through internal R&D , partnerships with academic groups, and active involvement of commercial companies. Almost all experiments at NSLS-II will create enormous amounts of data, most of it stored and processed in digital form. For this reason, careful consideration should be given to the capabilities for storing and distributing the data and to the types of data processing capabilities that will be pro-vided. Currently, there are plans to support data collection, storage, and analysis, but the details of the implementation are still being worked out. Information from similar facilities will be used to design the computational infrastructure. The plan to allow remote data collection, processing, and access is a welcome development. All these developments will neces-sitate implementation of state-of-the-art networks and strong computational support. Support for Beamline Staff, User Community As mentioned, the impact of NSLS-II in the life sciences hinges to a great extent on the success of the Biology Village. The most important component of the Biology Village will be the personnel comprising it. On one hand, many of the most challenging experiments will require the involvement of highly specialized beamline scientists to conduct them. On the other hand, the experiments also require strong involve-ment from biological scientists to prepare samples and APS Facility14 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Chapter 3. National Synchrotron Light Source-IIanalyze and interpret results. For this reason, ensuring excel- lent collaboration between beamline scientists and experi-menters is extremely important. This can be accomplished not only by the availability of physical space for interaction and sample preparation and manipulation, but also by giving beamline scientists time to engage in productive collabora-tions with users, local researchers, or scientists from other institutions and embark on beamline-related, Ph.D.-type projects. In addition, the presence of local scientists with strong research programs in relevant areas will help maintain a vibrant atmosphere conducive to forefront research. Lim-ited funding for internal research is available, but additional research support is expected to come from external sources. For this reason, it is very important that NSLS-II scientists are competitive not only internally, but also externally. A strong emphasis should be placed on ensuring that the scientific staff actively engages the research community and seeks outside support.Projected staffing levels include one to two Ph.D.-level scientists, one engineer, and 0.5 FTE (full time equivalent) technicians per beamline. This staffing level is similar to that at other U.S. facilities but more modest than at comparable facilities elsewhere, such as the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility-Grenoble, which has on average two scientists at the postdoctoral level and a 0.5 FTE beamline operation manager. Furthermore, the staffing level at NSLS-II may need to expand as demand increases, especially if remote operations become routine. It is important to note that staff support will depend on outside funding and hence is likely to be uneven across different beamlines. Exploring alternative ways of supporting staff to achieve a more even staffing of all beamlines is likely to be important.15 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Chapter 4.

As currently envisioned, it will include an array of 10 independently configurable x-ray free-electron lasers ( XFEL s) powered by a superconducting linear accelerator and capable of deliver - ing ultrafast (attosecond to femtosecond), high-brightness (up to 10 12 photons/pulse), high-resolution pulses of soft x-rays [ 3 kiloelectron volts (ke V), with reduced flux at higher energies]. These pulses will be delivered at high rates of repetition (as short as microsecond intervals, or 1 MH z) because of the superconducting accelerator design (see Figs. 4.1, this page , and 4.2, p. 16 ). Each of these features defines the experimental potential of this planned facility and distinguishes it from existing synchrotron and XFEL s, including the Linac Coherent Light Source ( LCLS ), which has a repetition rate four orders of magnitude lower (see Fig. 4.2). The high pulse repetition rate is a singular feature of NGLS that will enable time-resolved experiments and acquisition of billions of x-ray \"snapshots\" within experi - mentally practical time frames (hours, not days).NGLS also will allow a greater average photon flux than is currently available at existing x-ray laser sources, including LCLS . In contrast, LCLS produces pulses whose peak bright- ness is one to two orders of magnitude higher, and it has significantly higher brightness at the high-energy/hard x-ray energies. Uniform spacing of NGLS x-ray pulses will further allow for shot-by-shot sample replacement and data collec-tion, in contrast to the burst mode design of the European XFEL . Hence, NGLS will have useful and distinct features. These capabilities are likely to have profound impacts on future biological research (see T able 4.1, p. 17 ). Some of the most exciting experimental capabilities of NGLS for biology include: 1. Obs ervation of structure and spectra on the real time scales (including femtosecond) of biological events. 2. I maging of single molecular complexes, membrane pro- tein complexes, macromolecular assemblies, organelles, and cells\u2014outside the context of a large crystal and, in some cases, prior to the onset of molecular damage. 3.

H igher-throughput experimentation and broader access of the scientific community to these technologies because of the ability to operate 10 XFEL s concurrently. While features 1, 4, and 5 are unique to NGLS , 2 and 3 are shared with LCLS and its planned upgrade, LCLS -II. How - ever, NGLS and LCLS , as currently planned, would differ in the kinds of biological systems observable by each due to differences in their wavelength ranges of optimal photon flux (see T able 4.1, p. 17 ). Specifically, LCLS produces high-brightness x-ray pulses of short duration in the <1 to >10 keV energy range. As planned, NGLS , by contrast, is a soft x-ray source where harder x-rays would be avail - able only via harmonics of the fundamental wavelength, which are expected to be of lower intensity. However, NGLS 's performance at x-ray harmonic energies is yet to be optimized, and it is possible that some attention to such optimization could enable more productive use of the hard x-rays in experiments. Importantly, both conventional dif - fraction experiments and high-resolution single-molecule imaging would require harder x-rays to observe features less than ~ 4 angstroms ( \u00c5) in scale. NGLS would therefore be of greatest use not for determining atomic-resolution structures of molecules, but for imaging macromolecular topologies and objects up to the cellular size scale. It seems likely that many important biological applications of NGLS are yet to be determined and will deliver types of informa - tion unlike any yet available.Facility Capabilities and Potential for High-Impact Experiments Several NGLS experiments such as x-ray scattering, \"diffract and destroy\" nanocrystallography, and spectroscopy could have a high impact on biological science. X-Ray Scattering: Biological Objects in Native Environments and in Real Time Small-angle x-ray scattering ( SAXS ) in the soft x-ray wave- length range currently gives only low-resolution structural information about biomolecules in solution, in part because diffracting objects rotate too fast to allow sufficient scatter - ing data from each object to be obtained. The speed and brightness of the NGLS source will allow multiple scattering snapshots to be collected within the time scale of a molecu-lar rotation, eliminating the \"spherical averaging\" neces - sitated by existing, slower soft x-ray sources. Coupled with the appropriate detectors and needed computational tools for image reconstruction, such scattering techniques will enable imaging of biomolecules and molecular assemblies in motion and outside the context of a crystal. The soft x-ray source likewise will be amenable to element- specific imaging of the lightweight bioelements, including carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen, as well as phosphorus and sulfur (the latter being potentially important for phasing scattering patterns). Resonant x-ray reflectivity for enhanc - ing either the sensitivity to selected light elements or the e-density contrast matching of light elements (as possible in the soft x-ray regime) may be particularly valuable for determining the structure of membrane proteins vectorially oriented in single lipid bilayer membranes. It also would aid investigation of the dynam-ics of these structures via pump-probe approaches (the latter facilitated by NGLS 's high repetition rate). Finally, the high-intensity NGLS source can provide significant structural infor-mation using scattering data from single molecules or molecular assemblies (e.g., delivered to the x-ray beam via a microfluidic jet or viewed by rastering a beam across a crystal surface) rather than averaged information from many mol-ecules in a crystalline array. This will enable visualization of intrinsic structural hetero-geneity in biological systems, Fig. 4.2. Comparison of pulse characteristics at existing and planned light sources. [Courtesy of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory] 17 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Chapter 4. Next Generation Light Source APS FacilityLinac Coherent Light Sourcean important and as-yet unexplored experimental frontier. Such measurements will need to take advantage of existing and improving technologies for sample delivery currently in use at LCLS . Collectively, these capabilities will revolutionize biological science. Diffract and Destroy Nanocrystallography As also described for LCLS , diffraction experiments using smaller nanocrystals will be possible with NGLS . Such exper - iments are desirable in the biological context because large, well-ordered crystals of many biomolecules (and particularly large complexes such as molecular machines) are not readily obtainable. The optimal wavelengths for these experiments (hard x-ray) may fall outside the range of high-brightness wavelengths for NGLS . Hence it is unclear whether sufficiently well resolved diffraction images on nanocrystals may be obtained with NGLS (see Limitations and Needs section). Spectroscopy The high pulse rate and high brightness of NGLS offer new opportunities for time-resolved x-ray absorption spectroscopy ( XAS ). Element-specific imaging of the lightweight bioelements via their characteristic absorption wavelengths was mentioned above. Also, conventional K - and L -edge XAS on metalloen- zyme solutions can be carried out in a time-resolved fashion. Limitations and Needs For biology, NGLS is ideally suited to the study of larger biological objects, such as molecular complexes, in time-resolved ways and in close-to-native environments (e.g., in solution) using scattering methods such as fluctuation SAXS (f SAXS ). As presently planned, NGLS would enable diffrac - tion or other experiments aimed at the subnanometer-length scale, via the use of harder x-rays generated as harmonics of higher-brightness pulses at longer wavelengths.Averaging data from several pulses could lead to sufficient hard x-ray flux, but using NGLS this way would provide data akin to what could be gathered from a synchrotron source. However, the coherence of NGLS , along with the specific pulse structure, enables measurement approaches quite different from synchrotrons, even at harder x-ray energies where data might be accumulated from multiple pulses. Although they exploit information from multiple pulses, these approaches are very different from simply averaging the data from multiple pulses. For instance, in specific experiments, a user would like to accumulate many individual f SAXS snapshots and then com- bine them in an intelligent way (e.g., so that the azimuthal correlation patterns are properly oriented). Manifold map - ping is another example of a powerful analysis method that exploits coherent scattering data accumulated from multiple pulses. Again, this requires individual snapshots and is quite different from what can be achieved by simply averaging over many pulses, as might be done at a synchrotron source. For example, accumulation of data from multiple pulses has the potential to recover phases and possibly calculate ab initio structures for molecules in solution. In current synchrotron-based SAXS experiments the scattering data are spherically averaged, in effect projecting the three dimensions of the structure onto one dimension. The restricted information available from these one-dimensional projections is insuf-ficient for unambiguous structure determination. The ability to collect many millions of scattering patterns from x-ray pulses at NGLS will provide information about the fluctua- tions around the mean SAXS signal (i.e., modulations in the nominally radially symmetric SAXS signal). Calculations show that extraction of the single molecule autocorrelation function from these data will provide significantly more observations (two orders of magnitude) than traditional SAXS methods. This will greatly improve the ability to gener- ate atomic models based on scattering data. Ultimately, it may be possible to recover phases from the continuous scattering pattern and calculate ab initio structures for the molecule(s) in solution. It would, therefore, be useful to address two issues as the NGLS project goes forward. First, optimizing the brightness of the hard x-ray harmonics may be of some use because the very high pulse repetition rates of NGLS may thus be brought to bear at smaller length scales, at least to a practical extent. Second, since NGLS offers such unique capabilities relative to synchrotrons, LCLS , or any existing light source, it will be exceedingly important to communicate with the biological community and cultivate a cadre of potential users who can develop new applications and techniques. NGLS is not merely a brighter synchrotron, a faster LCLS , or a new Advanced Light Source, but a brand new entity for which the possibili-ties are yet to be fully conceived. Development of NGLS experimental capabilities will cer- tainly benefit from soliciting and maintaining input from two Table 4.1.

Next Generation Light Sourcegroups: LCLS users and staff and the cryo-electron micros- copy community. The latter will be of particular importance in developing computational methods for image reconstruc-tion from scattering data of heterogeneous samples. In addi-tion, because many NGLS hardware, software, and detector needs will be rather unique, the production of certain spe-cialized equipment is expected to be unattractive to industry vendors. Thus, the academic physics community will need to be engaged not only in NGLS use, but also in its development. Special Capabilities and Ancillary Facilities for Biology Six areas deserving consideration are: 1. E xperimental stations. These are essential components of the facility. Having sufficient funds available is crucial so that stations can be planned, constructed, and ready when the light source is operational. 2. D ata management and software development. Ver y large amounts of data, including data from time-resolved \"stroboscopic\" measurements (as also proposed for the upgraded Advanced Photon Source), will require substantial software development, data management, and commensurate hardware for high-performance parallel computing and storage. 3. N ew algorithms for image reconstruction. New algorithms, such as manifold embedding as proposed by Abbas Ourmazd, are very promising and will be necessary to make full use of the data obtained from large numbers of scattering experiments. T esting of such algorithms with phantom data already has been started, well before the new facilities are in place.4. B iological preparative lab. A laboratory for prepara - tion and parallel characterization of samples with experienced staff must be made available onsite. Equip - ment for such a laboratory could include centrifuges, refrigerators and a cold room, dark room, chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography equipment, mass spectrometers, light scattering, and an electron microscope. 5. D etectors and related equipment. Detectors matching the speed of the source and having a large pixel number must be available. While LCLS could provide significant input in this area, the measurement time scales will be much faster at NGLS . Additionally, equipment should be available for tandem measurements of fluorescence or other kinds of spectroscopy. 6. T echnique development. NGLS will offer capabilities that are not dreamt of yet. Dedicated beam time and support for ongoing technique development should be available. Support With new-generation light sources, a large and sophisticated team is required because every facet of the experiment is non-trivial\u2014from sample preparation and handling (e.g., injection and mounting) to data collection, processing, and archiving. Staff scientists in particular are essential because they serve as the connection between the users, facility, and beam. Adequate funding to support these positions thus is needed. Since experimental needs will be well beyond the state of the art, multidisciplinary collaborations in the areas listed above will be vital. As with synchrotrons, having staff with biological as well as facility expertise will be vital to bridge the gap for biologists who may want to use the x-ray source but require assistance to do so. Finally, once experimental time is ready to be allocated, having different panels that review proposals focusing on spectroscopy, imaging, crystallography, and tech-nique development will be important.19 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Chapter 5. Spallation Neutron SourceBrief Facility Description The Spallation Neutron Source ( ) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory ( ORNL ) is becoming one of the world's most powerful sources of neutrons for investigating the structure and dynamics of biomolecular systems by elastic and inelastic neutron scattering. Isotopic substitution, specifically deuterium for hydrogen in the case of biological systems, coupled with contrast matching of selected components provides a distinct advantage for neutron scattering techniques. This reveals key aspects of the structure and dynamics within complex macromolecular systems over a wide range of length and time scales. While these techniques are important for studying biological macromolecules in single crystals, they are essential for inves - tigating more complex, noncrystalline systems, including multicomponent macromolecular assemblies in solution and liquid-crystalline membranes. Two important proposed upgrades were built into the design of SNS . One would boost the power of the proton accelerator, increasing the flux of spallation-produced neutrons by a factor of two to three times. This increase is highly significant because most neu-tron scattering experiments are \"flux-starved\" (i.e., limited only by the neutron flux available). The other upgrade would add a second target station optimized for the production of longer-wavelength \"cold\" neutrons, important for structural studies of large macromolecular systems. This station would provide much-needed additional capacity, including instru-ments optimized for the study of biological systems. Sources of thermal and cold neutrons [ = 1 to 20 angstroms ( \u00c5)] include nuclear fission1 and proton accelerator-based nuclear spallation2. Both are polychromatic, with the former being continuous and the latter inherently pulsed. Importantly, the neutron flux densities (neutrons/sec/mm 2) available from even the most powerful of these sources are dramatically lower (by many orders of magnitude) than the photon flux densities available from synchrotron radiation-based x-ray sources. As a result, neutron scattering techniques, both elastic and inelastic or quasielastic, are generally utilized only when they can provide either the best or the only approach to a specific structural or dynamical problem.In accelerator-based spallation sources, negatively charged hydrogen ions are produced by an ion source and stripped of their electrons, producing protons. The protons are injected into a linear accelerator\u2014composed of both normal and superconducting radio frequency ( RF) cavities\u2014that acceler - ates to an energy of 1 gigaelectron volt ( GeV), providing a total proton beam power of 1.4 megawatts ( MW ). SNS currently is operating somewhat below parameter at ~1.0 MW . The high-energy protons are then injected into an accumulator storage ring that bunches them into 1 microsecond pulses. These are directed to a liquid mercury target, chosen for its superior capabilities in dissipat - ing thermal energy and shock effects arising from the pulsed proton bombardment. The target is surrounded above and below by a collection of moderators, either liquid water or liquid hydrogen (20 K) that cool the high-energy neutrons produced by nuclear spallation to produce room-temperature, or thermal neutrons, and cold neutrons, respectively. Importantly, the initial design of SNS can accommodate increases in both proton beam energy (1.0 to 1.3 GeV) and current (1.4 to 2.3 milliamperes (m A)], resulting in an increase in total proton beam power to 3.0 MW , thereby tripling the currently available neutron flux. In addition, a second target ________________ 1Nuclear fission is an exothermic nuclear reaction, either induced by neutron bombardment or spontaneous, resulting in a heavy nucleus splitting into two lighter nuclei with the release of energy, neutrons, and photons (-rays). Under appropriate conditions, this can become a chain reaction resulting in an intense source of \"fast\" neutrons. This \"hot\" Maxwellian distribution can be cooled (\"moderated\") to produce a distribution of \"slow\" neutrons with de Broglie wavelengths ( = 1 to 20 \u00c5) suitable for elastic and inelastic scattering experiments. Because the nuclear fission process occurs randomly among the ensemble of heavy nuclei, the fission neutron source is effectively continuous. 2Nuclear spallation is the production of neutrons via the bombard- ment of heavy nuclei (e.g., T a, W, and Hg) with a beam of high-energy protons from a particle accelerator. Again, the energies of the spallation neutrons are adjusted via \"moderation\" to produce a distribution of \"slow\" neutrons with de Broglie wavelengths ( = 1 to 20 \u00c5) suitable for elastic and inelastic scattering experiments. Because the proton accelerator is inherently pulsed, the spallation neutrons are similarly pulsed.sPalla Tion neuTron sourceChapter 520 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Chapter 5. Spallation Neutron Sourcestation also can be accommodated, approximately doubling the number of neutron scattering instruments. Specific Facilities at SNS Macromolecular Neutron Crystallography. Two single-crystal diffractometers\u2014 TOPAZ (available 2012) MaNDi (available 2013)\u2014will enable the investigation of three-dimensional ( 3 D) macromolecular structure at both lower resolution (>10 \u00c5), relevant to macromolecular solvent structure (e.g., lipids and detergents for membrane proteins), and high resolution (1.5 to 2.0 \u00c5) for determining protein structure. Data acquisition rates of these facilities will exceed current capability by 10 to 50 times. Unit cell dimensions of up to 150 \u00c5 can be investigated at 2.0 \u00c5 spatial resolution by utiliz - ing crystal volumes as small as 1 mm3, or down to 0.125 mm3 for perdeuterated proteins with TOPAZ and potentially down to 0.001 to 0.01 mm3 with MaNDi. These instruments also are well suited to structural studies of partially ordered systems, protein and nucleic acid fibers in particular. Reflectometry. Two reflectometers, the \"magnetism reflec- tometer\" with a horizontal reflection plane and the \"liquids reflectometer\" with a vertical reflection plane, are operational at SNS . The magnetism reflectometer instrument enables direct phasing of reflectivity data by employing a magnetic reference structure adjacent to the layered bio-organic struc-ture to be determined, for example a membrane at the solid-liquid interface, with the solid incorporating the reference structure. The liquids reflectometer allows structural studies of macromolecular systems at the liquid-gas and liquid-liquid interfaces relevant to the study of biological membranes. Both instruments access a broad range of momentum trans-fer up to 0.3 to 0.4 \u00c5-1, with a dynamic range of reflectivity extending down to the level of 5 \u00d7 10-8 and data acquisition times of a few hours. Small-Angle Neutron Scattering ( SANS ). One SANS Q -range SANS (EQ-SANS ), can access a broad range of momentum transfer of 0.004 \u00c5-1 < q < 1.5 \u00c5-1, or a somewhat more limited range of 0.003 \u00c5-1 < q < 0.4 \u00c5-1 in a single configuration for time-resolved studies utilizing a 30 Hz pulse repetition rate.Inelastic Scattering. Three instruments are available for inelastic scattering. The Cold Neutron Chopper Spectrometer ( CNCS ) accesses the shorter time scales of 10-13 s to 3 \u00d7 10-10 s with 100 times higher flux than previously available. The Back - scattering Spectrometer ( BaSiS) accesses somewhat longer time scales of 10-12 s to 2 \u00d7 10-9 s with a flux 60 times higher than previously available. The Neutron Spin Echo Spec - trometer ( NSE ) accesses much longer time scales extending to 5 \u00d7 10-7 s (and 1 to 2 \u00d7 10-6 s by 2012). Biodeuteration Facility. Deuteration is key to the applica - tions of neutron scattering in structural biology. Currently, a substantial facility exists at ORNL for the biodeuteration of biomolecules, including proteins and nucleic acids. For proteins, the biodeuteration facility can provide (1) perdeu- teration of an entire protein; (2) perdeuteration of all copies of one or more selected amino acids throughout a protein; and (3) \"segmental labeling,\" namely the selective perdeutera - tion of tertiary structural components within a quaternary structure or covalently linked domains within a multidomain tertiary structure, the latter achieved via chemical ligation. Facility Capabilities and Potential for High-Impact Experiments Macromolecular Neutron Crystallography Due to its much higher sensitivity to hydrogen atom loca-tions, neutron diffraction from single crystals is capable of accurately determining these locations under physiological conditions with significantly lower-resolution data (e.g., ~1.5 to 2.5 \u00c5) compared to x-ray diffraction, which requires a very high resolution (e.g., <1.0 \u00c5), cryotemperatures, and very accurate data to locate the hydrogen atoms in a macro-molecule. The major advantage of neutron crystallography of proteins lies in its unique capability for detecting the loca-tions of hydrogen atoms, or protons, within the overall 3 D structure. The number of significant challenges in structural biology benefiting from this approach is potentially quite large. For proteins, they range from investigating: The me chanism of action of enzymes in which hydrogen atoms or protons play a key role, including the ionization states and hydrogen bonding of residues and water within the catalytic site. The me chanism of protein folding, including the roles of hydrogen bonding and solvation. S mall-molecule or macromolecular ligand binding involv- ing essential hydrogen bonding. Insights provided by such investigations would be key in enabling the genetic engineering of enzymes to improve their performance and stability in nonnatural hosts for industrial applications and the rational design of pharmacological agents for modulating protein physiological function. While the number of such problems investigated has been relatively few to date, they include the classic contribution establishing the protonation state of the charge relay system in serine proteases. A significant disadvantage of neutron crystallography for proteins traditionally has been the requirement for relatively large crystal volumes. This is associated with the low flux densities available from fission sources and utilization of the Bragg method for collecting neutron diffraction data, appropriate for continuous neutron radiation but requiring only a very narrow bandwidth of the available continuous radiation. The time-of-flight quasi-Laue method for collect-ing neutron diffraction data from macromolecular single crystals\u2014required for the most effective utilization of the poly chr omatic, inherently pulsed neutron radiation from 21 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Chapter 5. Spallation Neutron Sourcespallation sources\u2014was first developed at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center at Los Alamos National Labora-tory in the United States. Importantly, this method also has significantly reduced the crystal volume now required with the newest instruments at SNS , namely down to the level of 0.1 mm3. These developments ultimately could enable anal- ysis of the proton-pumping mechanism of membrane protein complexes responsible for biological energy transduction, an area of continued controversy and significance. In spite of the quite broad range of potentially significant problems in structural biology, the current perception is that they represent a relatively small subset of biological crystallography. However, it is important to stress that the primary reason for this perception likely lies in the past requirement for comparatively large crystal volumes due to the relatively low incident neutron flux densities available. Thus, important to note is that the crystal volume required for this capability at SNS will be substantially reduced to the level of 0.1 mm3 with the commissioning of the TOPAZ instrument in 2012 and further reduced to 0.001 to 0.01 mm3 with the MaNDi instrument in 2013. Nevertheless, even the greatly reduced crystal volume required by these new SNS instruments remains at the high end of what is now needed for x-ray crystallography. As a result, continued development of coupling the neutron spallation source and moderator to effective neutron optics is essential for increasing neutron flux density, thereby further decreasing the minimal crystal volume needed. Reflectometry The major advantage of neutron scattering from partially ordered, noncrystalline macromolecular systems (e.g., fibers and membranes) lies in its unique ability to determine macro - molecular conformations within complex, multicomponent assemblies. A key example is provided by the case of neutron reflectivity, here broadly defined to include specular 3 and off- specular3 neutron reflectivity from oriented membranes (i.e., oriented in the laboratory frame at a solid-liquid or solid-gas interface, ranging from thick multilayers down to the level of a single membrane). Deuteration of a particular macromolecu-lar component, or submolecular portions thereof, coupled with contrast matching of the remaining components can reveal the conformation of the selected component within a complex membrane system. The conformation of a func - tional integral membrane protein component within a single phospholipid bilayer membrane at the solid-liquid interface can be investigated as a function of the transmembrane electrochemical potential, providing key information into its mechanism of action. For a membrane-associated protein, whose function is to alter the physical-chemical properties of the membrane's lipid bilayer matrix, the conformations of both the protein and lipid components can be investigated separately as a function of their interaction. However, deter - mining the conformation of the protein and/or lipid depends upon detailed computer modeling. For protein structure, this is based on the 3 D crystal structure, which is determined independently and then critically constrained by the available structural information from the reflectivity experiments. The latter are limited to the projection of the protein's (or lipid's) 3 D structure onto the normal to the mem br ane plane, and, in some cases, also the projection onto the membrane plane. For biological mem br anes, the membrane protein's environment in the fully hydrated, noncrystalline lipid bilayer is more bio - logically relevant than that within a single crystal. Within the overall range of currently perceived significant problems in structural biology, those in membrane biology would appear to gain the greatest advantage from the neutron reflectivity approach. This derives mostly from the ability to investigate functionally relevant conformations and confor-mational changes of selected macromolecular membrane components under physiological conditions. Currently, those working in this field remain limited to a relatively small number of more-expert users. Nonetheless, the breadth of potential problems in membrane structural biology uniquely accessible via neutron reflectivity would appear to justify a substantial extension to effectively address the significant problems of interest to less experienced users. Small-Angle Neutron Scattering The major advantage of SANS from macromolecules and supra- molecular assemblies in isotropic solution again lies in its unique capability for determining macromolecular conformations within complex, multicomponent assemblies. As for the case with membranes, deuteration of a particular macromo-lecular component (or submolecular portions) coupled with contrast matching of the remaining components can reveal the conformation of the selected component within a complex supramolecular system. For several macromolecu-lar components in isotropic solution, conformations can be separately investigated as a function of their interactions in forming binary, tertiary, and higher-order complexes. These complexes can be composed of oligomers of a single protein component, different protein components, and protein and nucleic acid components. For a single macromolecular component in isotropic solution, its conformation also can be investigated as a function of its interactions with one or more small-molecule ligands centrally related to its biological function. Importantly, determining the conformation of a macromolecular component again depends upon detailed computer modeling, based on the respective 3 D x-ray crystal structures determined independently and critically constrained by the available, spherically averaged structural information from SANS experiments. For macromolecular biological components, or supramolecular complexes thereof ___________________________ 3\"Specular reflectivity\" refers to elastic scattering from an oriented multilayer structure with momentum transfer perpendicular to the layer plane. \"Off-specular reflectivity\" refers to elastic scattering with the momentum transfer parallel to the layer plane.22 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Chapter 5. Spallation Neutron Sourcein isotropic aqueous solution, the environment is more bio- logically relevant than that within a single crystal. Within the overall range of currently perceived significant challenges in structural biology, those concerning the conformations of macromolecular components in iso-tropic solution, or selected macromolecular components within supramolecular complexes in isotropic solution, would appear to gain the greatest advantage with the SANS approach. Again, this derives mostly from the ability to investigate functionally relevant conformations and confor-mational changes of selected macromolecular components under physiological conditions. Currently, researchers work-ing in this field include a substantial number of more-expert users as well as nonexpert users. Furthermore, the breadth of potential problems in structural biology uniquely accessible via SANS would appear to justify a substantial extension to effectively address these significant problems of interest to the broader scientific community. Inelastic Scattering The major advantage of inelastic and quasielastic neutron scattering lies in the extremely broad range of time scales of periodic motions over a wide range of length scales [0.1 nanometer (nm) to 100 nm] that can be accessed. Spe-cific applications in structural biology include the investiga-tion of (1) light-induced exciton diffusion in photosynthetic complexes at the faster extreme, (2) local motions in proteins affected by small-molecule ligand binding and the relative motions of protein domains associated with the function in the intermediate regimes, and (3) diffusive and undulatory motions in macromolecular ensembles (e.g., in membranes at the slower extreme). Molecular dynamics computer simulations are very important for quantitatively interpreting the scattering data to provide detailed information on the dynamics of protein motions down to the level of specific elements of secondary structure and individual residues. Otherwise, there is no special advantage here with regard to investigating the dynamics of biological macromolecular systems in physiologically relevant environments, given that neither the inelastic and quasielastic neutron scattering techniques nor other physical techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance and isotopic exchange require a three-dimensionally ordered structure. Although inelastic neutron scattering clearly has already had a major impact in condensed matter science, its promise for structural biology remains largely unfulfilled. This is likely due to the low-incident neutron flux available at the sample, as limited principally by the nature of the neutron source. Investigations of protein dynamics in various environ-ments, including within lipid bilayer membranes, have provided some interesting results. However, it would now appear that application of the neutron spin echo technique to investigations of physiologically relevant factors affect-ing undulatory motions in membranes may offer a needed breakthrough in this area. Importantly, this situation may improve substantially with SNS development that provides an enhancement of 10 to 50 times in incident neutron flux most relevant for the investigations of slower motions evidenced by proteins and membranes. Lastly, the 30 to 60 Hz repetition rate of pulsed spallation neutron sources provides the possibility of \"pump-probe\" studies of the structural evolution of biological macromo-lecular systems if the mechanism of action is relatively slow (>10 -5 s) and is (or can be made to be) cyclic. This would enable the collection of statistically significant scattering data via signal-averaging for a specified pump-to-probe delay time. One such example is provided by voltage-gate ion channel proteins vectorially oriented within a single membrane at the solid-liquid interface, where the protein can be cycled between closed and open states via the applied transmembrane voltage to investigate the mechanism of elec-tromechanical coupling at the submolecular level. Additional Biological Applications of Elastic Scattering It is important to note that there are many other biological applications of primarily elastic neutron scattering techniques highly relevant to the missions of the Department of Energy and National Institutes of Health. Notable examples would include: S tructural studies of the interactions of natural and arti- ficial functional protein systems with inorganic surfaces and polymer matrices relevant to solar energy conversion (solar to power and solar to fuel). I nteractions of enzymes with cellulosic materials relevant to biomass to biofuel conversion. M echanism of enzymes for carbon sequestration and renewal energy. D evelopment of biocompatible polymer scaffolds and drug delivery systems. Plans for Upgrading SNS Many technical margins were built into the SNS design and hardware to facilitate a power upgrade from the current baseline 1.4 MW level to the 3 MW range. The upgrade plan builds upon recent progress in SNS development programs to improve superconducting cavity performance in the linear accelerator (linac), mitigate intensity thresholds in the accu-mulator ring, and reduce cavitation damage in the mercury target. Because key elements of the upgrade rely on replicat-ing existing designs, the upgrade is positioned for aggressive deployment. The proton beam energy will be increased by 30% from 1.0 GeV to 1.3 GeV, and the time-averaged accelera- tor output beam intensity will be increased by 65% from 1.4 m A to 2.3 m A for 3.0 MW of beam power. Because the vast majority of neutron scattering experiments are flux limited, even modest improvements in source 23 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Chapter 5. Spallation Neutron Sourceintensity can lead to scientific measurements that were previ- ously out of reach. An increase in power by a factor of two will enable the study of smaller samples and real-time studies at shorter time scales. It also will allow a modest increase in resolution on most instruments and enable more experi-ments to take advantage of the highest resolution available on each instrument. Importantly, by providing beam power to support a second target station, the power upgrade facilitates a significant expansion of capacity and substantial perfor-mance gains for long-wavelength applications of neutron scattering techniques (see below). Although the second tar-get station can be implemented without the power upgrade, its power level\u2014and hence scientific performance\u2014will be significantly curtailed if its operation were to come at the expense of the existing target station. SNS was designed to accommodate a second target station optimized to produce longer-wavelength \"cold\" neutrons. This station would be a \"long-pulse\" facility that uses the full millisecond proton pulse length from the linac, providing a 50% increase in proton flux on target. Focusing the resulting cold neutrons would provide at least an order of magnitude improvement compared to the instruments now operating on the first target station. In particular, the intense cold neutron beams will enable the extension of kinetic studies (e.g., via SANS and reflectivity) down to the 10 microsecond regime utilizing sample modulation techniques. Revolutionary new capabilities would enable investigation of the lateral struc - ture of interfaces and membranes at length scales from 10 to 1,000 nm via reflectivity. Tightening the angular resolution will permit focusing down to 10 micron-size neutron beams, thereby greatly facilitating the investigation of much smaller samples, including protein crystals, and providing totally new neutron imaging capabilities. The high-intensity cold neutron beams also will extend dynamical studies employ - ing spin echo techniques by an order of magnitude for the study of slow motions up to 10 microseconds on length scales up to a micron. Importantly, adding this extended capability to the ones already (or soon to be) available in the first target station could allow for the addition of instruments optimized for and (at least partially) dedicated to structural biology. These could include, for example, a bioreflectometer enabling magnetic phasing and vertical reflection plane and a Bio- SANS instrument.Support Substantial Expansion of the Deuteration Facility. Given the cr itical importance of deuteration to neutron scattering in structural biology, the current biodeuteration facility at ORNL should be substantially expanded. This should include an extension to site-directed labeling at the tertiary structure level via both chemical synthesis (e.g., to selectively labeled lipids, polysaccharides, and peptides) and to protein semisynthesis. Importantly, protein semisynthesis may provide a key break - through needed for investigations of protein conformations directly involved in their mechanisms of action. Expanding the Protein Crystallography Users Group. For macromolecular neutron crystallography, it is essential to continue the development of coupling the neutron spallation source and moderator to effective neutron optics as required to increase neutron flux density, thereby further decreasing the minimal crystal volume necessary. A relevant example is provided by Ice et al. (2005). As long as we continue to not understand, and therefore not control, the crystallization process, we can neither control the size nor the degree of periodic order in 3 D crystals. Both are key in determining the positions of hydrogen atoms in the overall 3 D structure\u2014the former (crystal volume) for the case of neutrons, and the latter (degree of periodic order) for the case of x-rays. Impor-tantly for the neutron case, the crystal size accessible for perdeuterated proteins is often smaller than that for the fully hydrogenated case. Expanding the Neutron Scattering Community in Struc- tural Biology. T o make the most significant impact on important biological problems, a major sustained effort is required\u2014ranging from the production of optimal biologi-cal materials to the utilization of fully integrated structural techniques. As a means of engaging a larger user community, SNS might consider stronger collaborations with institutions already possessing such integrated programs in structural biology. Establishing such a \"structural biology village\" of major users with the necessary capabilities might greatly facilitate the dissemination of the overall utility of neutron scattering techniques in biological research.

For more than a decade, APS has been providing the brightest hard x-ray beams available in the Western Hemisphere to the most users of any U.S. synchrotron radiation source. In 2010, almost 3,800 users performed experiments at 62 beamlines. Biological science is a vital component of the research activ- ity at APS. Currently, 41% of users are in the biological and life sciences field, 3% in environmental sciences, and 2% in medical science. Funding for this community is quite diverse, with more than 50 institutes, states, and agencies\u2014including the DOE Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER) \u2014contributing funds for construction and operation of beamlines managed by Collaborative Access T eams and for some enhance-ments of APS-managed beamlines. In 2010, over 1,100 users received funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH ), and about 50 were supported by BER . As shown by colored ovals in Fig. A1, half the sectors at APS primarily serve this community with techniques such as macromolecular crystallogra-phy (MX) ; small-angle x-ray scattering copy; and microprobes. Although the majority of biological and life sciences research is conducted at beamlines managed by Collab or ative Access T eams, some biological research is per-formed on every beamline at APS. For example, 31% of the microprobe facility users at beamline 2- ID were funded by NIH or BER , and 43% were classified as life scientists. Biological research at APS results in about half the facility's publications (~600 per year) and accounts for 20% of the worldwide deposits into the Protein Data Bank. APS Upgrade Project Over the next decade, the facilities at APS will be improved to stay at the forefront of x-ray science. The primary vehicle for this improvement will be the APS Upgrade project ( APS-U ), a major accelerator and beamline equipment upgrade approved by the DOE Office of Science in April 2010 at an Advanced Photon Source Upgrade Facilities for Biological Science for the Next Decade at APS * __________ *Argonne National Laboratory prepared this and a companion document (p. 35) and approved post-workshop revisions to each.[Courtesy of Argonne National Laboratory] Fig. A1.

[Courtesy of Argonne National Laboratory] 28 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Appendix A: Advanced Photon Source Upgrade Facility Paperestimated cost of $300 M to $400 M (APS 2010). APS-U has been designed to complement the National Synchrotron Light Source-II (NSLS-II) project at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The upgrade will provide the highest flux and brightness in the world at x-ray energies above 10 and 20 kilo-electron volts (ke V), respectively (see T able A1, this page). These qualities will be achieved through improvements to the accelerator, increased electron current, and undulator sources such as \"revolver\" undulator systems and innova-tive superconducting undulators. APS-U also will provide the higher stability needed for imaging, microfocus, and high-resolution studies. Other outstanding capabilities will be available for time-resolved studies through flexible opera-tional modes of x-ray pulses with a duration of 100 picosec-onds (ps) provided to all beamlines and a unique accelerator system that will produce 1 ps x-ray pulses for a subset of beamlines. In addition to these source improvements, APS-U will enable major enhancements in experimental capability and capacity through a suite of new and improved beamlines. A large expansion in the number of forefront beamlines is made possible by implementing \"canted\" undulators that provide sources for two independent high-brightness beam-lines from a single APS sector. These improvements will allow APS to continue to provide leading-edge x-ray capabilities to the biological sciences community through the next decade and beyond. The vision for biological sciences has been developed in the \"Proteins to Organisms\" theme of the APS-U Conceptual Design. This theme addresses the grand challenge of identifying how proteins and other macromolecules, under the influence of environmental factors or inherent genetic programming, determine function at every level of organization\u2014from biomolecular interactions to an organism's higher functions. As described in more detail below, APS-U will enable a signifi - cant extension of the ability to probe protein structure and dynamics and to image directly and indirectly nonperiodic soft structures spanning length scales from millimeters to 10 nm (i.e., from tissues to cells to subcellular structures). This will be the first time since the beginning of biology that the same imaging technique can be used with increasing reso - lution from microns to 10 nm and with samples cryogenically preserved in their native state. Several characteristics of the upgraded APS provide advantages to biological science research. A primary feature is the excel-lent source flux and brightness at high x-ray energies. As described below, higher energies can reduce the effects of radiation damage in macro - mo lecular crystallography studies. The deeper penetration of higher-energy x-ray beams enables in situ observations critical for environmental science and whole-organism and tissue studies. For fluorescence microscopy, higher energies provide access to all elements in the periodic table. APS has a strong existing suite of beamlines, many optimized for bio-logical science applications and all available to the biological research community. APS-U 's improved electron-beam stabil- ity and current will benefit all beamlines. and time-resolved studies will complement this existing base. The large floor area available at APS also pro- vides space for important ancillary facilities. Wide-Field Imaging Beamline. Funded as part of APS-U , this new facility will strengthen the capabilities for biological science at APS. The high flux and partial coherence of the x-ray beam enable synchrotron x-ray imaging to combine the penetrative power of hard x-rays with high sensitivity and exceptional spatial and temporal resolutions. No other imaging technique has this combination of properties. For example, optical techniques do not have the same penetrat-ing power, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasounds do not have the same spatial and temporal reso-lutions. Synchrotron-based x-ray phase-contrast imaging (as shown in Fig. A2, p. 29 ) has enabled direct visualization of the dynamics of millimeter-sized animal physiology in real time at the micron scale (Westneat et al. 2003; Kaiser et al. 2007; Lee and Socha 2009; Simon et al. 2010). The Wide-Field Imaging beamline of the APS-U will expand current full-field imaging capabilities at APS in three crucial ways: (1) increase beam size to the centimeter scale, (2) increase the sensitivity for phase-contrast imaging, and (3) reduce the source-size blurring contribution to spatial resolution. The increased beam size will allow the study of important biomedical models (e.g., rats and mice) and accommodate a much wider Table A1.

Due to the high photon flux, obtaining full three-dimensional (3D) images of centimeter-sized living animals with micron resolution in less than 0.1 s will be possible. Thus, researchers will be able to see a beat-ing mouse heart in 3D at high spatial resolutions in real time . Current techniques for 3D visualization of heart dynamics depend on \"retrospective-gating\" (i.e., postsynchronization of images using other physiological monitors) of 2D images averaged over many heartbeats. The ability to view small-animal physiology with high resolution in real time will open up avenues of biomedical research currently unavailable. High-Energy T omography Beamline. This second imaging facility, funded as part of APS-U , is significant for biological science. The importance of this capability to understand biological systems can be illustrated via studies of bone and biomineralization. Example challenges that could benefit from materials-based research on mineral - ized tissue and its replacements are (1) bone fragility in osteoporosis, (2) implant stability and wear resistance in joint replacements, and (3) impaired fracture healing in the elderly. Such research will have a major role in improving health and reducing morbidity and mortality. The roles of genetics, biology, and epidemiology in the study of miner - alized tissue dysfunction are not to be underestimated, but bone is a composite of protein, calcium phosphate mineral, and water\u2014each of whose constituent functions remain poorly understood. Understanding the basic processes in biomineralization is important in establishing what consti - tutes \"good\" versus \"poor\" bone quality, a basic materials question. Systemic interactions in vivo complicate direct studies of bone, and much progress has been made with invertebrate models whose mineralization-related proteins are close analogs of those in bone. Because soft tissues surround and produce the mineral in echinoderms, attain-ing enough phase contrast from soft tissue in the presence of heavy absorption from the mineral and from the long fluid path length is a challenge. High-energy imaging is the solution because it decreases absorption contrast relative to phase contrast; however, such imaging is practical only at hard x-ray light sources like APS . The High-Energy T omog - raphy beamline will provide that solution by developing a 20 to 60 ke V beamline and suitable area detectors. Advanced Protein Crystallization Facility (APCF) . Also important to the future of biological science at APS and in conjunction with APS-U will be construction of the APCF . This facility will be a highly automated state-of-the-art laboratory\u2014integrated with a scientific collaboration and user facility\u2014for the production and characterization of proteins and macromolecular crystals and the design of proteins with new activities. The APCF building, funded by the state of Illinois, will be adjacent to APS to provide streamlined access to beamlines and take full advantage of ANL 's capabilities for determining the 3D structure of macromolecules and characterizing their functions. Focusing on the most challenging classes of proteins and macromolecular assemblies, APCF will be home to several research groups and will provide highly flexible labora - tory and office space for outside users. These laboratory activities will be supported by common core facilities. The space is designed to facilitate discussion, interaction, and collaboration as defined by its users. The facility is expected to produce many microcrystals requiring the capabilities of the upgraded APS and the new microfocusing beamline. Similar facilities are operating at the Hauptman-Woodward Institute, Structural Biology Research Center at the Photon Factory, Protein Production Facility at Oxford, and the European Molecular Biology Laboratory's high-throughput crystallization facility at Deutsches Elektronen Synchro - tron (DESY) in Hamburg.

[From Sanishvili, R., et al. 2011. \"Radiation Damage in Protein Crystals is Reduced with a Micron-Sized X-Ray Beam, \" PNAS 108(15), 6127-32.]Biological Science Beamline Plans In addition to the improvements in x-ray source performance provided by APS-U (e.g., increased current and stability and new undulator sources) that will benefit all existing APS beam - lines, the biological science community has proposed several new beamlines and beamline upgrades. Although these proj-ects will be funded separately from APS-U , their scientific cases have been reviewed and recommended by the APS Scientific Advisory Committee, and space has been allocated on the \"roadmap\" for future APS plans. Highlighted below are some projects that have been proposed by the user community and included in planning for APS-U . The synergy of the excellent properties of the upgraded APS source, the active APS biologi - cal science community, the existing beamlines' high capacity and wide range of capabilities, and the location of the planned forefront capabilities at APS will enable cutting-edge biological research for years to come. Microfocus Macromolecular Crystallography Beamline Many macromolecules, complexes, and cellular assemblies are very difficult to produce, and their crystals tend to be small, imperfect, and weakly diffracting. A micron-sized x-ray beam enables researchers to study and optimize data collection from very small macromolecular crystals and potentially ordered intracellular arrays and microcompart - ments within cells. An x-ray beam size of 5 to 20 \u00b5m can be obtained by collimating the beam produced by a typical undulator beamline at a third-generation synchrotron source. Because crossfire in the beam converges to the focus, the collimating pinhole must be close to the sample. However, distance and aperture limits result in unaccept - ably long exposure times. Furthermore, these \"fixed-size\" collimated beams can be adjusted to crystal sizes only in fixed-step sizes, resulting in high background scattering for very small crystals. This problem can be solved by using highly demagnifying optics capable of imaging the source into a natural focal spot of 1 to 2 \u00b5m while still accepting most of the source divergence. The greatly increased flux density compensates for the decreased exposed volume, resulting in reasonably short exposure times. The microfocus facility will be highly complementary to existing APS MX beamlines and the BioNanoprobe, as well as capabilities developed at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) and the planned microfocus beamline at NSLS-II . By providing a microbeam capability, the facility will improve data quality and efficiency for very small samples. In addi-tion, research at APS has demonstrated that radiation damage and its deleterious effects on data quality can be reduced with a micron-sized beam because damaging photoelectrons deposit their energy outside the diffracting volume of the crystal, as shown in Fig. A3, this page (Finfrock et al. 2010; Sanishvili et al. 2011). Also, the best-quality data predictably could be obtained at higher x-ray energies (20 to 30 ke V), of which the upgraded APS will be the ideal source. Other bene - fits of the micr ofocus facility are reduction of background and increase of signal-to-noise for small crystals, as well as the use of more ordered regions of crystals for data collec-tion. The substantial increase in x-ray beam stability and cur-rent provided by APS-U will make the proposed microfocus beamline reliable and productive. BioNanoprobe I and II The presence of metals and trace elements is essential for the existence of life as we know it. In any organism, there are very few intracellular processes not dependent on the pres-ence of metals or other trace elements. Y et environmental contaminants\u2014both heavy metals and radionuclides\u2014can have considerable negative impacts on living systems. The BioNanoprobe I is a scanning fluorescence nanoprobe with cryotransfer capabilities and sub-50 nm spatial resolution. Funded by NIH and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, BioNanoprobe I was delivered to APS in summer 2011. Moreover, the instrument was commissioned for the first time in November 2011. Users obtained images of a cell with its surface decorated with nanoparticles at 70 nm resolution and of cryogenically frozen cells imaged at cryogenic temperatures. As the first of its kind, the BioNanoprobe I will significantly advance the ability to probe and understand the role of trace metals in biology and environmental science. In addition to investigating dynamic changes in the concentrations and localization of metals in cells and organelles, this instrument will enable 3d visualization of the elemental content in the spatially heterogeneous microenvironment around cells. Distance from burn spot (m)31 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Appendix A: Advanced Photon Source Upgrade Facility Paper APS-U FacilityThe nanoprobe will considerably improve the achievable spatial resolution in biological samples and soft materials, such that precise 3d elemental maps can be acquired even in small organelles, vesicles, and within and adjacent to actively metabolizing cell surfaces and membranes (de Jonge et al. 2010; de Jonge and Vogt 2010). X-ray phase-contrast methods, largely developed at APS (Holzner et al. 2010; de Jonge et al. 2008; Hornberger et al. 2008) will simultaneously provide the ultrastructural context. A cryogenic specimen environment, with cryotransfer, will minimize radiation damage and permit imaging of frozen-hydrated specimens preserved as closely as possible to their natural state. After gaining some years of operational experience with BioNanoprobe I, a second-generation instrument with new and enhanced capabilities will be developed. In situ fluorescence light microscopy\u2014at cryogenic temperatures and with high numerical aperture\u2014will permit correlative studies such as the correlation of select fluorophores [including green fluorescent protein (GFP) ] with specimen ultrastructure and trace metal content. This com-bination of features, illustrated in Fig. A4, this page, will make the BioNanoprobe II a unique instrument for biological and environmental sciences, enabling, in particular, the following upgraded (1-3) or new (4-5) capabilities: 1. Throughput and sensitivity improved by up to a factor of 20 through increased beam current, optimized undulators and monochromators, and better detectors compared to BioNanoprobe I. 2. Spatial resolution improved to 10 to 20 nm by building upon BioNanoprobe I experience to work with shorter-focal length, higher-aperture x-ray optics. 3. (Semi)automated x-ray fluorescence tomography using phase contrast to make dose fractionation feasible with-out the use of fiducial markers.4. Visualization of the trace elemental content of specimens in the context of their ultrastructure by using novel approaches to exploit Zerniuctke-type phase contrast in scanning x-ray microscopy (Holzner et al. 2010). 5. Correlative microscopy combining trace elemental content with protein localization by permitting in situ visualization of fluorophores (e.g., GFP fusion proteins) using optical cryomicroscopy. Enhanced SAXS and WAXS It is becoming increasingly clear that a complete descrip- tion of biomolecular activity requires an understanding of the nature and role of conformational dynamics for proteins, DNA s, RNA s, and their assemblies in solution. The resounding success of the worldwide macromolecular crystallographic effort over the last few decades has led to a burgeoning of high-resolution structures. These structures raise new questions about how macromolecules react in solu-tion to changing environmental conditions, bind to ligands, and especially how they assemble into larger macromolecu-lar complexes. The ability of SAXS to yield low-resolution macromolecular envelopes allows high-resolution structures and fragments to be assembled into high-resolution model structures, inaccessible by crystallographic means, that can yield insight into their function. Another growing area is the combination of global orientational information from nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) residual dipolar coupling measurements with the global dimensional information from small-angle scattering restraints. Used together, these two complementary techniques form a powerful combination for structure characterization, determination (Wang et al. 2009), and refinement (Grishaev et al. 2005). The combined use of SAXS and NMR measurements has been applied to proteins Fig. A4. Schematic of the BioNanoprobe II. Hard x-rays are focused onto a specimen that is raster-scanned through the focus. Ultrastructural information is acquired by exploiting phase contrast, while trace elemental information is simultaneously acquired using x-ray fluorescence. 3D specimen reconstructions, including both structural and elemental information, are calcu lat ed from numerous individual projections. Dose fractionation (Hegerl and Hoppe 1976) is exploited to minimize dose and acquisition time. [From de Jonge, M. D., et al. 2010. \"Quantitative 3D Elemental Micro tomography of Cyclotella meneghiniana at 400-nm Resolution, \" PNAS 107(36), 15676-80.] 32 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Appendix A: Advanced Photon Source Upgrade Facility Paper(Grishaev et al. 2005), protein-protein complexes (Zuo et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2009), RNA s, and an RNA -RNA complex (Zuo et al. 2008). These emerging applications\u2014along with traditional pair distribution function P(r) and radius of gyration R g analysis\u2014have been major driving forces for the exponential increase in the use of SAXS and WAXS for biologi- cal research in recent years. Consequently, SAXS and WAXS have played a critical role in experiments resulting in many high-profile publications from 2000 to 2011. For example, they were used in research described in approximately 20 papers in the EMBO Journal , 20 in Science, 50 in Cell, 50 in the Nature group, and 90 in Proceedings of the National Acad- emy of Sciences. About two-thirds of these papers had U.S. scientists as corresponding authors. WAXS extends the range of SAXS to spacings comparable to those of crystallography (~2.0 \u00c5), greatly expanding the range of possible experiments (Fischetti et al. 2003; Makowski 2010). The intensity falls off rapidly with scattering angle; therefore, high-brilliance undulator beamlines such as those available at APS are required to record accurate scat- tering intensities from macromolecules to these spacings. When combined with the capability of calculating solution scattering data from atomic coordinates (Park et al. 2009), WAXS becomes a powerful technique for testing structural models constructed by other means, such as molecular dynamics, homology modeling, or ab initio approaches (Zuo et al. 2006). WAXS data have proven highly sensitive to small changes in protein structure induced by ligand binding ( Fischetti et al. 2004; Rodi et al. 2007), changes in oxidation state (Tiede, Zhang, and Seifert 2002), and the effect of mutations (Yang et al. 2010). Time-resolved WAXS studies have been highly informative in tracking conformational changes (Cammarata et al. 2008; Choa et al. 2010) and have proven effective in the study of membrane proteins (Anders-son et al. 2009) as well as dynamics in systems through research on changes in protein ensembles. WAXS studies can be used to investigate protein folding and unfolding in great detail (Hirai et al. 2004); are sensitive to modulation of structural fluctuations (Makowski et al. 2008); and can be used to monitor shifts in the character of a protein ensemble in response to environmental changes, ligand binding, or mutations (Makowski et al. 2011). The high quality of data achievable with SAXS and WAXS instruments using third-generation undulator radiation will be further enhanced by the improved beam stability and higher beam current from APS-U , potentially opening new avenues of study. The proposed new beamline will enable capabilities for anomalous SAXS (ASAXS ), an basi- ( MAD ) method in crystallography. grazing incidence SAXS (GISAXS ) measure- ments that could be used to determine accurate molecular envelopes of biomacromolecules in model membranes (Andersson et al. 2009). Furthermore, WAXS offers the pros- pect of collecting detailed structural information concerning structural intermediates that exist only in the presence of other structural forms. By adjusting the solution conditions that determine the relative abundances of different interme-diates, structural information can be obtained about transient forms involved in, for instance, enzymatic regulation (Yang et al. 2010; Bernado and Blackledge 2010). The ease with which proteins under different conditions can be studied opens up a wide range of possibilities for the future. However, no APS beamline currently is fully dedicated to biological solution scattering studies. The planned beamline is a fully automated, dedicated undulator beamline capable of simultaneously recording SAXS and WAXS data with high flux and tunable high x-ray energy. T ogether with the improved beam stability and higher beam current from APS-U , this beamline has the potential to revolutionize the applica - tion of scattering in biological research and accelerate our understanding of biology at the molecular level under near-physiological solution conditions. Enhanced 100 ps High-Flux Pump-Probe Facility BioCARS , a national research resource currently funded by NIH , conducts time-resolved studies that probe problems of interest to structural biologists. The BioCARS 14- ID beamline is optimized to perform laser pump, x-ray probe experiments at 100 ps time resolution with the first harmonic of a focused undulator polychromatic (Laue) beam. A 100 ps x-ray probe pulse is isolated by an x-ray chopper to deliver nearly 4 \u00d7 10\u00b9 photons within a bandwidth (E/E) of ~4% to a tightly focused area at the sample of 90(H) \u00d7 20(V) \u00b5m\u00b2. The x-ray probe pulses are the picosecond laser pump pulses. The BioCARS per-pulse flux is similar to that delivered by free-electron laser ( FEL) sources such as LCLS (10\u00b9\u00b9 to 10\u00b9\u00b2 photons per pulse within a pulse of 10 to 100 fs and E/E of ~0.4%), albeit with longer time and wider energy resolution. BioCARS specializes in coupling this high- flux, time-resolved capability to well-established x-ray scat- tering techniques such as crystallography, WAXS , and general diffraction. For experiments that require narrow energy bandwidth (E/E of ~.01%), a Si (111) monochromator is available. With these key capabilities, BioCARS is uniquely positioned to contribute to ultrafast dynamical studies in the biological sciences complementary to those at the highly oversubscribed FEL sources. Despite the demonstrated successes of time-resolved macro - molecular crystallography, an important and major challenge involves studies of biologically interesting but irreversible reactions. All previous ultrafast time-resolved experiments beamline 14- ID, beamline ID09 Synchro - tron Radiation Facility ( ESRF ), and elsewhere have studied reversible systems in which the initial state is thermally re-established within, at most, a few seconds after reaction photoinitiation. Examples of irreversible biological systems studied by BioCARS users include (1) bacteriophytochromes 33 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Appendix A: Advanced Photon Source Upgrade Facility of considerable envi - ronmental significance with the rare ability of breaking the carbon-fluorine bond, the strongest covalent bond in organic chemistry); and (3) human quinone reductase 2 (a potential molecular target for the development of cancer chemopreven-tive compounds for which resveratrol is a potent inhibitor). The main limitation on studies of irreversible systems is the absence of large-area x-ray detectors with a fast frame rate, which consequently has constrained all time-resolved x-ray diffraction experiments to date to a single pump-single probe approach. This approach is particularly inefficient for irreversible reactions that require a new sample (or new sample microvolume) for each pump-probe event. For such reactions, a time-slicing detector would allow the much more efficient single pump-multiple probe approach. Fol-lowing a single reaction initiation with a pump laser pulse, the reaction could be probed with a sequence of x-ray pulses. Currently available detectors, such as the photon-counting Pilatus, are not appropriate for this application due to the 1 MH z count rate limit, which is several orders of magnitude too low for Laue x-ray diffraction experiments. The proposed enhancement to the BioCARS facility includes the develop- ment and implementation of a large-area, fast-readout, analog-integrating pixel array detector (the so-called APAD ) to open the new horizon of irreversible processes to the biological science community. Because this capability is also of strong interest to the physical sciences community, joint funding across agencies is anticipated. Cryo Sample Preparation Facility T o image biological materials as closely as possible to their native state, they typically must remain hydrated to maintain structural fidelity and reflect the true location of diffusible ions. However, x-ray imaging (as well as macromolecular crystallography) also involves exposing molecules, cells, and tissues to extremely high doses of ionizing radiation. These would seem to be mutually incompatible requirements, yet a well-known solution exists: by maintaining the specimen at about 110 K or below, structural degradation due to irradia- tion is reduced by many orders of magnitude. Ultrafast or high-pressure freezing prevents the formation of ice crystals in suitable specimens and preserves them in vitreous ice as closely as possible to their native state. Working with cryo-genic specimens requires preparing and understanding them, purposes for which the Cryo Sample Preparation Facility has been planned for APS-U . While the damage resistance of cryospecimens is well known, only the most rudimentary cryopreparation methods have been available to the APS user community. Macro mo lecular crystals can be cryo c ooled onsite by dip - ping into liquid nitrogen a loop containing the crystal and a cryo pr otectant liquor. The loop can then be viewed at a resolution of several micrometers using the alignment tele-scope in an MX end station. In microscopy, no cryoprepara - tion facilities have been available, and specimens have been viewed only at room temperature. This has remained the case at APS in spite of a long history of advances elsewhere in cryo spe cimen preparation, including high-pressure cool - ing to produce low-mosaicity protein crystals (Kim, Kapfer, and Gruner 2005) and well-preserved tissues (Richter 1994) and cryo-ultramicrotomy to generate sections from tissues for high-resolution analysis (Erk et al. 1998). The Cryo Sample Preparation Facility will have wide impacts on biomedical and environmental science research at APS. Considerable effort has gone into the development of auto-mated sample-loading robots for handling already-frozen crystals at APS, so MX beamlines are well positioned to take immediate advantage of improved crystal freezing tech-niques. In microscopy, the BioNanoprobes described on p. 30 will be complemented by cryospecimen capabilities planned for (1) the transmission x-ray microscope for nanotomogra-phy and (2) coherent diffraction imaging studies of cellulose crystallinity in biomass for beyond-lens-limit high spatial resolution. The Cryo Sample Preparation Facility will play an essential role in complementing these efforts by providing a full suite of capabilities including: F acilities for cell and tissue culture. H igh-pressure cryocooling for crystallography. H igh-pressure and plunge freezing for microscopy. C ryosectioning for preparation of tissues. C ryo-focused ion beam (cryo- FIB) for tissues and for producing isolated crystal slabs. R esearch into timed freezing of dynamic biological processes. Because the compressed time frame of tightly scheduled competitive beamtime proposals does not favor the patient develop me nt of optimized freezing protocols, the Cryo Sample Preparation Facility also will include room-temperature and cryogenic light microscopy as well as cryo-electron micros - copy. (This also will enable correlative microscopy studies of hierarchical processes.) Finally, by being located at APS or in a possibly interconnected imaging institute, the facility will ben-efit research in ANL 's Center for Nanoscale Materials and the Electron Microscopy Center. APS in turn will benefit through interaction with researchers using similar sample preparation protocols in these other centers. In summary, APS-U will provide enhancements to the acceler - ator (e.g., improved current, stability, and undulator sources) and beamlines (e.g., for imaging and time-resolved studies) that will enable APS to remain at the forefront of the life and environmental sciences. Exciting new beamline facilities being proposed by the user community are well matched to exploit the extended capabilities and capacity at APS to advance the forefront of biological science in the coming decade.34 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Appendix A: Advanced Photon Source Upgrade Facility PaperReferences Andersson, M., et al. 2009. \"Structural Dynamics of Light-Driven Proton Pumps,\" Structure 17(9), 1265-75.

The types of current experiments and those projected for the future generally can be sorted into one of two categories: macromolecular structure determination and cell or elemental imaging. The APS Upgrade ( APS-U ) will provide enhanced capabilities enabling experiments in both categories that are currently challenging or even impossible to execute. APS-U will allow the probing of biological systems on a scale from several to a few thousand angstroms. This capability therefore will bridge the gap between x-ray crystal-lography and electron microscopy while addressing an over-arching theme of APS-U : \"Mastering hierarchical structures through imaging. \" APS-U will provide new opportunities to investigate macromolecular structures using single-crystal diffraction with micron-size beams, a technology currently in its infancy. Addition of the micron beam facility will bridge APS-U capabilities between regular-size beams and the x-ray BioNanoprobe used to study biological systems. A large biological user community thus will be able to take advan-tage of this expanded portfolio of APS capabilities in their research. Future APS capabilities can be envisioned to allow the integration of macromolecular structure determination and imaging in experiments aimed at characterizing single macromolecules in dynamic biological systems. Next-Generation Macromolecular Structure Determination Current Challenges Macromolecular x-ray crystallography has already provided structural representatives for the majority of proteins associated with key cellular processes (Marsden, Lewis, and Orengo 2007) and for numerous complexes and multicom-ponent assemblies such as the ribosome, RNA polymerase, nucleosome, molecular chaperones, and intact viruses (Schmeing and Ramakrishnan 2009; Wang et al. 2009; Reddy et 2010). Enabled by the genome sequencing revolution, next-generation sequencing is producing at unprecedented rates an order of magnitude more genome sequences that are publicly available. Not only are sequences of individual organ-isms being released to public databases, but so are genome sequences from entire environmental, human, animal, and microbial communities. These new sequences are predicted to provide a new wealth of knowledge and understanding about biological and macromolecular systems pertinent to human health, remediation and sustainability of the environ-ment, bioenergy production, and carbon biomanagement.Macromolecular x-ray crystallography is currently the most powerful method available for determining the 3D structures of macromolecules. However, significant challenges still remain for experiments aimed at increased high-throughput structure determination to capitalize on larger amounts of genome sequences as well as for studies seeking to determine structures of important macromolecular targets such as membrane proteins and macromolecular complexes. For example, some excellent progress has been made for several classes of membrane proteins such as G protein-coupled receptors (see Case 1, p. 36 ; Cherezov, Abola, and Stevens 2010; Rasmussen et al. 2011) transporters, and ion chan-nels (Lunin et al. 2006). But despite these advances, new approaches and technologies are needed to elevate our understanding of membrane protein structure, interactions, and function to the same level as that for soluble proteins. Drug target discovery and structure-based drug design are other important and challenging areas, as well as altering and tuning enzyme catalytic properties and specificities for a variety of applications. The tremendously expanded genome sequence databases will provide thousands of new promising drug target candidates and potential new catalytic functions. Structural coverage of several important human drug targets in recent years is remarkable (e.g., kinases, phosphatases, and proteases). However, both the design and implementation of high-throughput experi - ments to accelerate structure-based drug discovery for human targets and for combating human pathogens are currently constrained by available x-ray and computa - tional capabilities. Thus, expanded competence provided by APS-U combined with Argonne National Laboratory's (ANL ) advanced computing capabilities will provide new opportunities for critical insights in macromoleculer structure and drug discovery. APS-U will enable research- ers to address many new macromolecules and assemblies discovered through the integration of genomic, structural, and biological research. Facility Required to Address the Challenges Obtaining quality crystals for x-ray diffraction is the most significant limitation of macromolecular crystallography (Bolanos-Garcia and Chayen 2009). Many macromolecules and complexes are very difficult to produce, and their crystals tend to be small, imperfect, and weakly diffracting. Some samples may show significant differences in crystalline order across the crystal, and the diffraction may be highly aniso-tropic. A mixture of static and dynamic disorder may lead to diffuse scattering, resulting in high temperature factors 36 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental ResearchAppendix A: Advanced Photon Source Upgrade Science Paperand poor diffraction. If structures could be determined from initial crystallization trials that produce microcrystals, the throughput of structure determination would be acceler-ated and much more cost-effective. The capability to collect data from very small crystals or from multiple sites within larger crystals, together with reduced radiation damage, will provide new opportunities for experiments on membrane proteins and macromolecular complexes. Microfocus Macromolecular Crystallography Beamline. Proposed for APS, the microfocus beamline will provide this capability via the use of micron-size beams. This beamline will be central to increased throughput in macromolecular structure determination and to successful data collection from projects currently considered impossible. The feasibil-ity of using a small x-ray beam to produce high-quality data leading to crystal structure determination has been demon-strated. For example, the crystal structure of xylanase II was determined at 1.5 \u00c5 resolution with a flux of about 3 \u00d7 10\u00b9 photons per second and a beam size of around 1 \u00b5m\u00b2 at the sample (Moukhametzianov et al. 2008). Also promising are preliminary data from Japan's 1 \u00b5m-wide beamline BL32XU at SPring-8 and beamline B1-A the Photon Factory, as well as results with diffraction from protein nanocrystals at LCLS at Stanford University (Hunter et al. 2011; Chapman et al. 2011). APS-U will provide highly brilliant, very stable, and small x-ray beams with a broad range of energies that will enable data collection from micron-size macromolecular crystals. These capabilities will allow optimization of diffraction experiments while reducing the radiation damage to samples. The revolver undulators implemented by APS-U will deliver high-brilliance beams ranging from low to high photon energies (>40 ke V), without gaps between the harmonics, at relatively low total power on the monochroma-tor, which will improve thermal stability. The doubling of the beam current and the greatly increased beam stability together will provide ideal conditions for data collection from small crystals by using micron-size x-ray beams, mak-ing the APS microfocus beamline truly unique. Microfocus Beamline Experiments Experiments enabled by the microfocus beam- line will include structural analysis of (1) large transmembrane proteins and multicomponent assemblies or multidomain eukaryotic proteins; (2) viral particles and assemblies; (3) in vivo crystals and cell crystalline microcompartments as they form (e.g., viral assemblies, carboxy - somes, and enterosomes); and (4) crystals only a few microns in size. The following sections describe several examples of cutting-edge areas in which a dedicated microfocus beamline will contribute to landmark scientific discovery.Case 1: Large Transmembrane Proteins G protein-coupled receptors ( GPCR s) are the largest fam- ily of signaling membrane proteins in the human genome and play a critical role in the signaling of extracellular stimuli. GPCR s have been linked to the differentiation of stem cells and tissue-specific progenitor cells during development. They also regulate numerous cellular processes and have been implicated in many human diseases. In addition, GPCR s interact with small ligands and other proteins during signaling and thus represent a class of proteins that form complexes (see Fig. A5, this page ). For that reason, these proteins are highly targeted for drug development, and structure determination of the complexes they form is of high importance. However, obtaining high-quality samples of GPCR s is a significant challenge for structural studies, which have been hampered by crystals that are very small, difficult to reproduce, and poorly ordered. Recently, though, the crys-tallization of human membrane GPCR s in lipidic cubic phase was discovered to produce very small but highly ordered crystals. High-quality diffraction data from such microcrys-tals were collected for the first time (Cherezov, Abola, and Stevens 2010; Rasmussen et al. 2011) using the sub-10 \u00b5m minibeam at the APS GM/CA-CAT (the National Institute of General Medical Sciences and National Cancer Institute Col-laborative Access T eam) facility. The resulting diffraction pat-terns had a significant reduction in background, with strong intensities and improved diffraction resolution compared with patterns from data collected using larger beam sizes, providing evidence for the utility of small beams (Cherezov, Abola, and Stevens 2010; Rasmussen et al. 2011). Structure determination of membrane proteins is recognized as a grand challenge in macromolecular structure determination, and Fig. A5. The 2.4 \u00c5 crystal structure of human 2-adrenergic recep- tor. The structure of the adrenaline receptor in complex with cholesterol and carazolol was obtained using the minibeam at GM/CA-CAT at APS [From Authors' Summary section in Cherezov, V., et al. 2007. \"High-Resolution Crystal Structure of an Engineered Human 2-Adrenergic G Protein-Coupled Receptor, \" Science 318(5854), 1258-65. Reprinted with permission from AAAS. See also Cherezov, Abola, and Stevens 2010.] 37 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Appendix A: Advanced Photon Source Upgrade Science Paper APS-U Sciencethese initial studies using the minibeam demonstrate the importance of continued development of this technology. GPCR s belong to a class of proteins that appears, at present, to principally benefit from the use of micron-size beams for data collection. In fact, the development of minibeams at APS is driven by GPCR s science, since such beams as well as technologies developed for sample handling, data collection, and processing enable structure determination of these biomedically important membrane proteins. Combining the low background of small x-ray beams with the reduction in radiation damage offered by microbeam technology may be the most important contribution to this important biomedi-cal field. Results from these approaches indicate their great promise in enabling future studies of even larger and more complex assemblies. Integrins are large, heterodimeric membrane-spanning pro- teins comprising the largest family of adhesion receptors that mediate eukaryotic cell-cell, cell-extracellular matrix, and cell-pathogen interactions. A large part of the receptor dimer is extracellular, but both subunits traverse the membrane and contain short cytoplasmic domains. Integrins have evolved to allow cells to sense and respond to changes in their environ-ment. These proteins are very difficult to crystallize, and their crystals diffract poorly. A number of researchers study integ-rins, their domains, and various complexes. For example, in collaboration with Dr. Amin Arnaout from Harvard Medical School, researchers determined the crystal structure of the extracellular portion of integrin V, both free and in com-plex with a cyclic peptide, Arg-Gly-Asp (Xiong et al. 2002; Xiong et al. 2001). Twelve integrin domains assemble into an ovoid \"head\" and two \"tails. \" The ligand binds at the major interface between the V and subunits. These structures presented the first view of this very important molecule needed for cell signaling and provided a structural basis for the divalent cation-dependent binding of hetero d imeric alpha and beta integrins to their ligands. The Springer labora-tory at Harvard Medical School investigates integrins and their interactions. Integrin alpha and beta subunits form a head and two long legs in the ectodomain and span the membrane. Using a new crystal form, this lab was able to define the atomic basis for allosteric regulation of the con-formation and affinity for ligand of the integrin ectodomain how fibrinogen-mimetic to platelet (Zhu et al. 2009; Zhu et al. 2008; Baram et al. 2005). Active research on integrins and their complexes will continue to present huge challenges both in crystallization and crystallography for the foreseeable future. Continued advances in our understanding of this class of poorly diffracting crystals will require a microfocus beam to reduce background scattering and thus improve the signal-to-background ratio. Case 2: Multicomponent Assembly The ribosome is a large ribonucleoprotein assembly composed of both RNA and protein molecules. Bacterial ribosomes consist of a large (50 S) and small (30 S) subunit that combine to form the 2.5 megadalton ( MDa) 70 S func- tional assembly composed of S RNA , 5S RNA , 16S RNA , and about 50 proteins. The eukaryotic ribosome is even larger, with a 60 S large subunit and 40 S small subunit forming the 80S assembly. Because of the ribosome's universal role in pro - tein synthesis and a difference between bacterial (pathogen) and human ribosomes, these assemblies are very important targets for developing antimicrobial agents (Schmeing and Ramakrishnan 2009). Although the molecules are very large (0.8 to 2.5 MDa), their crystals are small and diffract weakly. Recent experiments with 10 and 7 \u00b5m beams at GM/CA-CAT beamlines showed the benefits from a very low back-ground and high flux density, revealing the structure of the N-terminal domain of trigger factor ( TF) in complex with large ribosomal subunit from the eubacterium Deinococcus radiodurans (Baram et al. 2005). These results suggest that the availability of a microfocus beamline with increased stability provided by APS-U will (1) reduce background and allow for data collection from weakly scattering crystals, (2) provide the ability to locate the best part of an inhomogeneous crys-tal, and (3) even allow structure determination of individual components in multicomponent assemblies. Case 3: Bacterial Microcompartments Bacterial microcompartments are new organelle-like struc- tures discovered inside bacterial cells (Y eates, Thompson, and Bobik 2011). Genomic sequence data reveal that these microcompartments are widely distributed in many bacterial species\u2014specifically, in over 40 genera (Kerfeld, Heinhorst, and Cannon 2010). These capsid-like protein assemblies con-sist of a few thousand evolutionarily related shell proteins. The microcompartments appear to enhance or provide a protective environment for key metabolic pathways inside the cell; metabolic functions include carbon dioxide fixation, degradation of small organic molecules such as propanediol and ethanolamine, and elimination of toxic metabolites. The microcompartments seem to encapsulate several sequentially acting enzymes to enhance or sequester certain metabolic pathways, particularly those involving toxic or volatile intermediates. These specialized metabolic functions may be particularly relevant to biofuel production and synthesis of specialized chemicals. The Y eates laboratory determined a number of shell protein structures (Y eates, Thompson, and Bobik 2011), and the DOE Joint Genome Institute's Genomic Encyclopedia of Bacteria and Archaea project, funded by BER , generated several novel microcompartment-related proteins. Several structures from some new bacterial spe-cies also have been determined in collaboration with the Midwest Center for Structural Genomics. These and other crystal structures of shell proteins from distinct types of microcompartments have provided keys for understand-ing how the shells are assembled and how they conduct molecular transport into and out of micr ocompartments. The structural data show a high level of complexity and 38 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental ResearchAppendix A: Advanced Photon Source Upgrade Science Papermechanistic sophistication and direct further studies on this intriguing but poorly understood class of subcellular assemblies. The distribution and diversity of these unique structures have been underestimated because many are not formed during growth on standard laboratory media. Relatively little is known about their assembly, turnover, and molecular evolution and how these processes are achieved at the molecular level. Given the microcompartments' com-plexity and distinctive structure, the biochemical mechanism may be unique for this class of crystalline-like subcellular assemblies, and in situ studies of their structure and assembly may require a micron-size beam. X-Ray Fluorescence Imaging Current Challenges With current developments in genomics and proteomics, our knowledge of the enormous number of pathways in which metals and trace elements are necessary for life is ever increasing. However, this knowledge is largely static because we still do not have appropriately sensitive approaches to follow the fluctuations in normal metal homeostasis that accompany the processes of, for example, development, differentiation, senescence, and stress response. Equally important is the interaction of biological systems with metals in the environment, a process that impacts the geo - chemistry of ecosystems as well as human health. Likewise, the elemental content of nanodevices and nanoparticles and their interfaces with cells, tissues, and whole organisms rep - resent a major field in which hard x-ray fluorescence micros - copy ( XFM ) imaging can play a significant role. Due to the nanoscale dimensions of these systems, a requirement for nanometer-scale resolution is implicitly necessary. For that reason alone, bionanotechnology investigators currently rely on atomic force microscopy and electron microscopy, nei - ther of which is optimally suited for determining elemental components of either the nanomaterials used or the cells with which they interact. From an environmental perspective, the chemical speciation of carbon greatly influences the partitioning and reactivity within its solid, liquid, and gas phases as well as its role in global climate change. Similarly, the mobility of heavy metal and radionuclide contaminants in subsurface environments is greatly influenced by the chemical speciation of the contaminants, especially their oxidation state. Predictions of future global climate change and contaminant fate and trans - port are highly dependent upon fundamental biochemical and biogeochemical interactions. Y et, much remains to be learned about the key processes that determine the rate and extent of cycling of these elements, particularly with regard to the coupling of biotic (microbial) and abiotic (geochemical) processes. The 3D , spatially microenvironment within and adjacent to actively metabo - lizing cell surfaces and membranes (~0.01 to 10 \u00b5m) can be significantly different from ensemble averages for environ-ments across larger spatial scales. Metabolic products can set up steep chemical gradients over very short distances. Fur - thermore, characteristics of the chemical gradients created at the microbe-mineral interface might differ under different biogeochemical conditions. Predicting the behavior of elements in such microenvironments is currently very chal - lenging because the chemistry of the environments has been difficult or impossible to define. The transformations of elements in such microenvironments can affect their macro - s copic fates. Therefore, information about heterogeneous biogeochemical interactions within, at, or near the microbial cell, its membrane, and the microbe-mineral microenviron-ment is paramount for predicting the fate of carbon and heavy metal and radionuclide contaminants. (See Case Study 3, p. 39 .) Facilities Required to Address the Challenges The BioNanoprobe will be designed to address the need to image, in tomographically 3D and with high resolution, the distribution and chemical status of metals and trace elements in environmental, biological, and medical samples cryopre-served to avoid radiation damage (at a resolution possibly as good as 5 nm in 10 to 15 years). Moreover, hard x-ray imaging with the BioNanoprobe II will be particularly suitable for heavier elements across the periodic table, and the addition of cryocapacity and an optical fluorescence microscope should make this instrument uniquely equipped for co-localization studies of optical fluorophores and trace elements. Develop - ment of nanoscale-resolution XFM will complement not only atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and analytical electron microscopy, but also the existing lower-resolution XFM beamlines at APS. The BioNanoprobe II will provide the unique opportunity to study samples across numerous length scales, from nanometers to centimeters, at trace elemental sensitivity. BioNanoprobe Experiment Examples A combination of unique features will make the BioNano- probe II the first instrument of its kind and will build upon an x-ray fluorescence nanoprobe for life sciences recently funded by the NIH National Center for Research Resources; it is being installed at the Life Sciences Collaborative Access T eam (sector 21 ) at APS. Areas of research opened by the use of XFM fall into two major categories: studies of \"natural\" metal and trace element distributions in health and disease and studies of distributions of metals, nanovectors, and trace elements deliberately or unintentionally introduced into organisms, cells, or the environment. Both areas are of great biological, medical, and environmental significance. The fol-lowing sections describe examples of a few cutting-edge areas in which the BioNanoprobe II will provide much scientific growth and development.39 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Appendix A: Advanced Photon Source Upgrade Science Paper APS-U ScienceCase 1: Tomography for Metallomics Imaging Cryopreserved Biological Samples in Their Natural State. Responses to trace element concentrations in natural algae and protozoan cells suggest strong linkages among the elements. For example, when iron is a limiting nutrient, cellular concentrations of manganese and zinc are also low, and when cellular iron increases, so do cellular concentrations of the other metals. One hypothesis is that iron limitation causes a physiological cascade that affects all metals involved in cell metabolism and reproduction. Likewise, low availability of iron limits the assimilation of nitrate by diatoms (Milligan and Harrison 2000). Nanoscale maps of metal distribution within the cell coupled with other spectroscopic and microscopic techniques would allow evaluation of these hypotheses. For example, the function of manganese and iron ring distributions within the silicon frustules is not known. Capabilities expected to significantly help elucidate the role of these metal rings are (1) higher spatial resolution (e.g., to determine whether manganese or iron are embedded in the silicon frustule), (2) higher throughput with automated x-ray fluorescence tomography, and (3) phase contrast for ultrastructural visualization. These improvements thus should lead to a better understanding of key nutrients in global biomass cycling. High spatial resolu-tion will be required to understand the role metals play on the molecular level in an organism, tomography is needed to understand the 3d arrangement of trace metals within the cell (see Fig. A6, this page), and a cryogenic specimen environment is necessary to achieve appropriate specimen preservation without artifacts. Case 2: Bionanotechnology Imaging Nanoparticles Physically and Functionally. Recent studies using multifunctional nanocomposites of titanium dioxide (TiO) and DNA have shown that these particles are functional inside cells and can be used both in facilitat - ing biomedical imaging and for gene therapy by removing harmful genes from genomes (Endres et al. 2007; Paunesku et al. 2003a,b; Paunesku et al. 2007; Brown et al. 2008). Following the patterns of degradation (either engineered or \"natural\") and stability or release of the nanocomposites and their constituents inside cells (Thurn et al. 2009), cells, tissues, and organisms will be critical for preclinical testing of such \"nanocomposite therapies. \" All these approaches require a probe with nanometer-scale spatial reso - lution to resolve organelles within cells and a high elemental sensitivity to detect minute amounts of nanoscale materials. At the same time, understanding the diversity of cell reactions to the introduction of these agents is crucial (e.g., to understand toxicity), including the events that occur only at low prob - abilities. Achieving this understanding will require the use of high-throughput approaches to survey large tissue areas. Also at the crossroads of nanotechnology and environmental sciences are studies of nanoparticle distribution in plants. One such recent study focused on TiO nanoparticles as well, but, in this case, their distribution in Arabidopsis thaliana cells was followed by XFM (Kurepa et al. 2010). In general, plant samples require high-resolution XFM (Kim et al. 2006), particularly when elemental information on differ-ent subcellular compartments is required. Nanoparticle development efforts are focused especially on development of multifunctional \"third-generation\" nanovectors made of combinations of inorganic and organic materials. Recently, an XFM microprobe was used to image TiO nanoparticles decorated with a peptide that matches the amino acid sequence of epidermal growth factor ( EGF ). These nanoparticles bind to but do not activate the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) signaling cascade, since the peptide used cannot induce EGFR phosphorylation. T o demonstrate co-localization of nanoparticles with EGFR (to the best resolu- tion with the current XFM microprobe), the intracel - lular membrane component of the receptor was labeled with EGFR- specific antibodies, and the cells treated with immu- nogold protein A. Interesting to note is that the first-ever BioNanoprobe I image (showing a cell with nanoparticles at 70 nm resolution) was obtained with the same type of sample. Co-localization of titanium and gold (albeit with a 300 nm beam spot size) suggests that there is indeed an interaction between the nanoconjugates and the EGFR (see Fig. A7, p. 40 ) and that patching and capping may take place even when the ligand is bound to a nanoparticle. Case 3. Imaging Metal Contaminants in Biological Systems Environmental Contaminant T ransformations. The mobil - ity of heavy metal and radionuclide contaminants in soil and subsurface environments is greatly influenced by the chemical speciation of the contaminants, especially their oxidation state. Many general points about biochemical and biogeochemical Fig. A6. Rendering of trace elements in freshwater diatom (Cyclotella meneghiniana) with its dense sili- ceous cell partially (virtually) removed. The dia- tom was shock-frozen, freeze-dried, and then imaged with an x-ray beam focused to 270 nm. Spectra were recorded at each of 24 angles at 150 nm intervals (de Jonge et al. 2010). The ring-like distribution of iron and manganese could not have been detected by any other imaging approach. These unexpected patterns may elucidate the role of metals in dia- tom biology and the role of diatoms in oceanic ele - ment cycles. [Courtesy of Argonne National Laboratory] Fig. A7. (Top) Elemental maps of a HeLa cell treated with nanoparticles containing titanium (Ti) and gold (Au) and a schematic of nanoparticle distribution at the cell mem- brane (bottom). Although the sulfur (S) image shows an outline of the whole cell, distribution of the protein epidermal growth factor receptor is outlined as Au signal because Au nanoparticles react with it. A peptide bound to TiO 2 nanoparticles serves as a ligand for epider - mal growth factor receptor, hence Ti and Au signals largely co-localize at the cellu lar membr ane.

The 3D , spatially heterogeneous microenvironment within and adjacent to actively metabolizing cell surfaces and membranes (~0.01 to 10 \u00b5m) can be significantly different from ensemble averages for environments across larger spatial scales (for more details, refer back to Current Challenges, p. 38, and see Fig. A8, this page). Probing the vast majority of the heavy metal and radionuclide contaminants of concern to DOE (e.g., Cs, Sr, T c, Hg, Pb, U, and Pu) via x-ray absorption processes requires x-ray energies greater than 15 ke V. The projected sig - nificant increases in incident photon flux resulting from APS-U , in conjuction with anticipated improvements in x-ray detector technologies, will enable chemical speciation measurements of elements at more environmentally relevant dilute concentra - tions than presently possible. The very high spatial resolution (down to 20 nm and below), combined with cryogenic sample preservation, and the corresponding minimization of radiation damage will permit localized measurement of the oxidation state of relevant heavy metals and radionuclides. That is, researchers will be able to not only determine where trace metals are located in and around a single cell, but also pinpoint their oxidation state. Mammalian Cells and Heavy Metals. A key reason for dili - gent studies on heavy metal and radionuclide contamination is the anticipated uptake of these contaminants by humans and other species, leading to health complications that may be avoidable. In the past 60 years, interest in radioactive actinides, in particular, has passed through different phases. The difficulty of handling these elements has slowed progress of this field greatly, compared to studies of many other environmental contaminants. The importance of plutonium in weapon devel - opment and its rich chemistry led to an initially prolific research thrust that eventually slowed down significantly due to the difficulties of handling and the resulting safety issues. Although, for example, plutonium is known to accumulate in the liver and bones of mammals, the chemical form of plutonium present in vivo and the identities of biomolecules that associate with this element in mammals are primarily conjectural. Therefore, a group of ANL actinide chemists led by Lynne Soderholm and Mark Jensen has focused on investigating the accumulation of plutonium by mammalian cells, with the goal of uncovering which chemical form of plutonium is found in cells and which macromolecules associate with it. The group's method of choice was x-ray fluorescence, as it is the only approach that allows mapping of plutonium in cells. T o identify its oxidation state, which is a critical determinant of the elemental chemistry, micro-x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (\u00b5- XANES ) was done as well (see Fig. A9, p. 41 ; Gorman-Lewis et al. 2011). This work documented that plutonium offered to the cells in different oxidation states and chemical forms does not have the same capacity for intracellular accumulation. The XANES spectra of the intracellular plutonium deposits were always consistent with a single valence state of plutonium. This surprising finding forms Fig. A8. Schematic (top) and electron microscopy image of a microbe-mineral interface illustrat- ing spatial scale and some complex interactions occurring in this microenvironment. [Top image from Kemner, K.

These archival tissues were collected through the concerted efforts of several national laboratories and institutes investigating the effects of plutonium uptake on animal models. A conglomeration of all such existing tissues has been stored in an archive at Northwestern University; efforts to complete this collection were funded by DOE BER over the past 5 years. The Future: APS Capabilities Enable Integrated Molecular and Whole-Cell Studies of Cellular Dynamics A concept underlying biological and biochemical studies today is that macromolecular interactions govern both cell and organism fate. From coping with DNA -damaging stresses to cognition, it is molecular interactions that regulate how an impulse will be detected and what its effects will be for the whole organism. The overwhelming complexity of these interactions lies at the core of all the problems faced by life scientists. Conversely, any technique that brings us closer to a systematic understanding of these interactions advances biology, medicine, and environmental science further toward those insights for which every science strives. On one end of the spectra of experimental possibilities lie approaches geared to isolate multiple copies of single macromolecules or macromolecular complexes; on the other are techniques focused on context-dependent changes in macromolecules as they perform their functions in situ, in different subcel - lular compartments, in different cell types, and in tissues and organs of different organisms. At present, most of these approaches look at multiple copies of macromol - ecules. Few techniques carried out in biological systems can boast of single-molecule sensitivity, yet a number of synchrotron-dependent techniques could reach that goal with the boosted sensitivity and resolution resulting from synchrotron modifications possible now or in the very near future. Moreover, by reaching toward single-molecule resolution, these (now disparate) techniques arrive at the same destination\u2014visualization of individual interactions between macromolecules and the downstream molecular effects of these interactions. The Microfocus Macromolecu-lar Crystallography beamline and BioNanopobe II represent two techniques that could reach such a common ground. Neuropathology and Neurodevelopmental Abnormali- ties. Studies of metal accumulation in brains of patients with Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and other diseases and in the spinal cords of patients with Lou Gehrig's disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) have already demonstrated that some metals are associated with disease progression and possibly disease onset (Campbell et al. 2001). Nevertheless, the precise cellu l ar and subcellular locations\u2014and in some cases even the regional brain locations\u2014of these metals are not known. For instance, an important contribution to understanding the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease ( AD) would be defining the precise loca - tions of copper or zinc in plaques, tangles, (see Fig. A10, this page ), nontangle-bearing neurons, and synapses in AD brain Fig. A9. Three-element co-localization maps of a cell incubated with plutonium. Microprobe x-ray absorption near- edge spectroscopy was used to determine directly, for the first time, the oxidation state of intracellular plutonium in individual 0.1 \u00b5m\u00b2 areas within single rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC12). These maps of a PC12 cell show the accumulation of plutonium in the cytoplasm (outlined as the area with chlorine signal).

At the same time, such studies could lead to the development of new diagnostic procedures, particularly when complemented by protein fingerprinting using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy or microdiffraction in situ. The nanometer-scale resolution possible with the hard x-ray BioNanoprobe II will be particularly useful for investigating changes at the synapse level, since synapses are less than 1 \u00b5m in size. Although, the decrease in synapses has, for some time, been known to be the major correlate with the cognitive decline observed in AD (T erry et al. 1991), the sequence of events leading to this decline remains unclear. Noteably, the microfocus beamline\u2014in keeping with the \"proteins to organisms\" theme\u2014engages in studies of the same proteins and reaches toward sensitivity and resolution required for in situ analysis of complex protein and protein-membrane assemblies. This and many other examples of complementary work at other APS-U beamlines will enable deeper understanding of results in each of these studies. Cell Signaling Research: Investigating EGFR-GPCR Dynamics. Another example of a cellular systems project that provides an interesting overlap of BioNanoprobe II imaging capabilities with the science anticipated to be done at the microfocus beamline is shown in Fig. A7, p. 40 . HeLa cancer cells were exposed to TiO nanoparticles conjugated with a peptide that matches the amino acid sequence of epidermal growth factor. These nanoparticles were shown to co-localize and interact with the EGF receptor. Currently, it is not known if this interaction further includes interactions between EGFR and G protein-coupled receptors. GPCR s are Fig. A11. Schematic representation of possible influence of nanoconjugate interaction with EGFR on further interactions of EGFR with GPCRs (green oval). (1) The lack of EGFR phosphorylation and possible change of conformation due to nanoconjugate binding may preclude EGFR interaction with GPCR. (2) Conversely, GPCR binding may be impervious to nanoparticle binding. (3) If the latter is the case, nanoparticles of yet another makeup can be used to immunolabel the GPCR for imaging at the BioNanoprobe II, or the diffraction patterns can be observed at the microfocus beamline. [Courtesy of W oloschak laboratory, Northwestern University (credit revised April 2012)](1) (2) (3) key research areas of the microfocus beamline, and a large family of GPCR s has been reported to transactivate EGFR via both ligand-dependent and -independent mechanisms (Thomas et al. 2006). Therefore, combined studies at the BioNanoprobe II and microfocusing beamline may include, for example, investigation on whether EGFR molecules bound to the nanoconjugate mimics still undergo transacti-vation by GPCR s or if such transactivation requires the recep- tor be free from its ligand. While these studies may be done on one level using \"classical\" molecular biology approaches such as Western blots, upgraded APS facilities would enable qualitatively different scientific investigation. Indeed, the ability to acquire and compare complementary data on the EGFR -GPCR protein \"complex\" through its co-localization (from BioNanoprobe II) and diffraction (from the microfo-cus beamline) may provide new paradigms in cell-signaling research (see Fig. A11, this page). Coupling the imaging and spectroscopy capabilities pro-posed for APS-U with existing capabilities will allow us to address scientific questions that cannot be addressed else-where. Specifically, in 15 years, the use of these nanoprobes will enable high-resolution 2D and 3D imaging of the spatial distribution of elements within hydrated or frozen regions in, at, or near the microbial cell, its membrane, and the microbe-mineral microenvironment via tomographic reconstruction. Similarly, coupling x-ray absorption spectroscopy measure-ments with these nanoscopy measurements is envisioned to enable the imaging of the chemical speciation of elements in these critical regions.1. 2. 3.43 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Appendix A: Advanced Photon Source Upgrade Science Paper APS-U ScienceReferences Baram, D., et al. 2005. \"Structure of T rigger Factor Binding Domain in Biologically Homologous Complex with Eubacterial Ribosome Reveals its Chaperone Action,\" Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 102(34), 12017-22.

Over the last 5 years, the construction of LCLS \u2014supported by the Office of Basic Energy Sciences ( BES) within the U.S. Department of Energy ( DOE )\u2014and its transition to full operations, which started with user-assisted commissioning in late 2009, have been accomplished. A vigorous user program is already well established. Four of the six instruments planned for LCLS -I are operational or in commissioning, and the complete facil-ity will be finished in FY 2012. At this point, DOE will have invested ~$500 M in construction and supports the LCLS operations with an annual budget in excess of $100 M. LCLS also has played a key role in the transformation of the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory from a predominantly high-energy physics laboratory to a true multiprogram laboratory with strong core capabilities in x-ray facilities and related enabling cutting-edge science. T oday LCLS , together with SLAC ( SSRL ), is the basis for SLAC 's current and future plans for growth and delivery of new science and user capabilities enabled by x-rays for understanding the structure and function of materials on the atomic and nanoscale levels. A suite of LCLS and SSRL instruments provides the capabilities for research at SLAC to span a range of dimensions (from microns to subnanometer) and time (from milliseconds to femtoseconds). LCLS is the key, new revolutionary element, opening up research opportunities in areas that include the emerging fields of ultrafast x-ray science, structural dynamics on the fastest time scales, imag - ing of nanocrystalline and nonperiodic materials at or near atomic resolution, and creation and study of new states of matter heretofore inaccessible. There is significant potential for future applications of LCLS in the biosciences, including areas of mission relevance to DOE 's Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER ). The first part of Appendix B, the Facility Paper, is one of two LCLS documents that have been prepared for the BER panel assessing the future potential of new DOE Office of Science scientific user facilities. It focuses on LCLS-I and its capabilities and on the expansion of LCLS (LCLS-II ) that already is approved by BES and is in advanced stages of conceptual design. The companion document, beginning on p. 53 , discusses the scientific case and potential of LCLS-I and LCLS-II as related to the biosciences and BER mission objectives. Brief History of LCLS LCLS was conceived in 1992 by Claudio Pellegrini of the Uni - versity of California-Los Angeles; over the years, design stud - ies were carried out at SSRL under the leadership of Pellegrini, Herman Winick, and Max Cornacchia. Following completion of the scientific case, documented in the report LCLS : The First Experiments (www-ssrl.slac.stanford.edu/lcls/papers/lcls_experiments_2.pdf) and a presentation to the Basic Energy Sciences Advisory Committee ( BESAC ) in October 2000, the LCLS project was awarded CD0 (critical decision 0) status in 2001. After breaking ground in 2006, the accelerator part was completed by early 2009. First light was observed on April 10, 2009, and, after only 2 hours, hard x-ray lasing and saturation were observed at 8 kiloelectron volts (ke V). Immediately thereafter, LCLS demonstrated reliable operations so rapidly that by August, the first instrument built for Atomic, Molecu-lar, and Optical ( AMO ) Science was commissioned. By early October, users were gathering their first data during \"user-assisted commissioning,\" much earlier than projected and well before CD4 , which was officially achieved in April 2010. Early involvement of users during the stepwise commissioning of the first three instruments proved so successful that it is being implemented on all the remaining LCLS instruments, with the last one scheduled to begin operation in early 2012. LCLS pres - ently operates in the 480 to 10,000 electron volt region. SLAC 's goal is to retain a leadership position of LCLS through strate- gic investments and innovative developments in accelerator, x-ray, and laser technologies and science, with a long-range plan that has the next step being LCLS-II (2018 completion) on the way to a vision for the facility that extends to 2025.Linac Coherent Light Source Facilities, Operations, and Future Perspective of LCLS-I and LCLS-II * LCLS I and II FacilityLCLS I and II Facility [Courtesy of SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory] __________ *SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory prepared this and a com- panion document (p. 53) and approved post-workshop revisions to each. 46 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Appendix B: Linac Coherent Light Source I and II Facility PaperLCLS Science In contrast to storage ring-based light sources, LCLS offers extreme peak brightness and full transverse coherence in its ultrashort x-ray pulses, brightness sufficient to capture a signature (diffraction or absorption/emission pattern) of electronic bonding or atomic structure in a single shot. This enables production of time-resolved rather than time-averaged information on the subpicosecond time scale. More specifically, LCLS x-ray pulses down to less than 10 femtoseconds (fs) are more than a factor of 1,000 shorter than those from storage ring-based x-ray sources, while containing about 10 \u00b9\u00b2 photons per pulse at 8 ke V (more than four orders of magnitude higher the any other x-ray source). Such pulses allow the observation of phenomena on the fundamental length and time scale of the motion of atoms and the associated charge and spin distributions. Breakthrough discoveries are expected in understanding the structure and function of materials on the atomic and nanoscale levels, as LCLS x-ray laser beams will, for the first time, enable the simultaneous investigation of their elec - tronic and structural properties on the size (subnanometer) and time (femtosecond) scales that determine their func - tion. LCLS experiments will reveal the speed limits enforced by nature that, in spite of the best human ingenuity, impose absolute constraints on technological advances (e.g., those that occur in the switching of magnetization bits required for magnetic recording of data). The experiments will pro - vide the opportunity to understand and ultimately control chemical processes, such as those central to the process of photosynthesis, which supplies our world with oxygen, or the catalytic reactions that underlie conversion of raw materials for energy production. LCLS will enable determi - nation of key reaction intermediates in chemical pathways that influence the environment and climate, as well as the structure of countless biological systems not accessible to current imaging techniques. Over its spectral range, LCLS offers almost fully spatially coherent x-rays instead of the small fraction offered at storage-ring sources. While the largely incoherent or \"dis-ordered\" x-ray beams of the latter sources require \"ordered\" samples, as exemplified by the need for crystals in protein crystallography, the coherent or ordered x-rays from LCLS can be used to determine the structure of disordered samples and nonperiodic materials, including biological materials, glasses, and liquids. Early experience with LCLS has dem- onstrated that it has met and exceeded all its performance goals; no other research facility in the world currently offers comparable capabilities. The stage is set for subsequent breakthroughs across a range of scientific disciplines.LCLS-I Accelerator, Operations, Instruments, and Users The LCLS Accelerator LCLS currently uses the last one-third of the 3 km-long SLAC linear accelerator, or linac, operating at 2,856 MH z (S-band) radio frequency ( RF) fields. A perspective of LCLS is shown in Fig. B1, p. 47 . The facility has been designed to allow future expansion, with use of the entire linac and up to eight undula - tors and separate x-ray beamlines. The LCLS-II project will take advantage of these capabilities. T o create LCLS , the last one-third of the linac was modified to include a new high-brightness photocathode electron injector, followed in the main linac by two magnetic bunch compressor chicanes that increase the peak current of the electron beam in stages through magnetic electron beam compression as the beam is accelerated along the linac. The new injector utilizes a copper photocathode illuminated by ultraviolet ( UV) light from a frequency-tripled pulse from an amplified Ti:Sapphire laser system to produce an extremely bright electron beam in a single bunch at a rate of up to 120 Hz. Each bunch has a typical charge of ~250 pico - coulombs (p C). For ultrashort x-ray bunch production, the charge can be made as short as ~20 p C in which the com- pressors operate more effectively with lower space-charge effects, allowing the production of shorter pulses. In fact, the pulse length can be readily varied between these values as user experiments dictate. The pair of new bunch compressors shortens the electron bunch and thereby magnifies the peak current from the injector by a factor of ~100. The high peak current is required to efficiently generate x-rays in the undulator and saturate at the shortest x-ray wavelengths. The electron bunch length is measured using a transverse RF S-band deflecting cavity, which works like a femtosecond-resolution streak camera for electrons and is capable of resolving bunch lengths as short as 25 fs full width at half maximum ( FWHM ). A special \"laser heater,\" the first of its kind in a linac-based free-electron laser ( FEL), is located in the injec - tor at 135 MeV. This adds a small level of energy spread to the electron beam to damp a microbunching instability before it potentially breaks up the high-brightness electron beam. Many beam-stabilizing feedback loops are in operation, with RF- and beam-based loops. The most critical loop uses linac RF phases and voltage levels to control the energy and bunch length after each compressor. The bunch length measurements are based on coherent edge radiation from the last dipole magnet of each compressor chicane, and this critical loop stabilizes the final peak current at any selected value. Because the x-ray pulse length is similar to the electron bunch length, the closed-loop control allows the operator to simply enter the user-requested pulse length into the computer.47 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Appendix B: Linac Coherent Light Source I and II Facility PaperThe LCLS Undulator and Photon Source At the end of the linac, a new 350 m-long transport line was built to deliver the 3.5 to 15 GeV compressed electron beam to the undulator located in a tightly climate controlled under - ground tunnel (with <1\u00b0 C variations) shown in the upper right of Fig. B1, this page. The LCLS undulator system is 132 m long, including breaks for quadrupole focusing magnets, resulting in 112 m of active undulator. It is composed of 33 pla - nar, permanent-magnet (neodymium iron boron) undulator segments 3.4 m long with a period of 3 cm, full gap height of 6.8 mm (fixed), and undulator magnetic deflection parameter K = 3.5 (corre spond ing to a peak magnetic field of 1.25 T). The undulators and focusing magnets are mounted on cam-based submicrometer controlled horizontal and vertical transla - tion stages to allow beam-based alignment. A 5 by 12 mm\u00b2 quasirectangular vacuum chamber within each segment has a highly polished aluminum surface to minimize electron beam interactions. Located at each of the 33 breaks are a focusing quadrupole magnet, a cavity-type electron beam position monitor ( BPM ), an insertable alignment and beam-size moni - toring wire, and a flexible vacuum bellows. T o maintain spatial overlap and relative phasing with the x-rays, the electron beam trajectory along the 132 m-long undulator is required to be absolutely straight at the level of ~5 \u00b5m rms over an FEL gain length of ~4 m [at 1.5 angstroms ( \u00c5)]. Beam-based alignment requires a few hours and is repeated every 2 to 3 weeks as necessary to maintain FEL power. The Front End Enclosure ( FEE) contains a range of monitors and diagnostics, including pulse-energy detectors that rely on absorption of x-rays in low-pressure nitrogen gas. The downstream half of the FEE is occupied by an x-ray beam switchyard based on grazing incidence mirrors. In addition to directing the FEL beam to various experimental stations, the mirrors serve as low-pass filters that separate the FEL radiation from higher-energy spontaneous undulator radiation and the Bremsstrahlung background radiation. Two mirror systems are used: a soft x-ray mirror system with the reflectivity cutoff at 2 ke V and a hard x-ray mirror system with the cutoff at 25 ke V. Moving the first soft x-ray mirror into the beam directs it to one of two soft x-ray experimental stations. Moving the first soft x-ray mirror out of the beam allows it to intercept two hard x-ray mirrors arranged in a periscope geometry and thence to several hard x-ray experimental stations. The soft x-ray mirrors are coated with boron carbide and the hard x-ray Fig. B1.

The mirrors were polished to extreme flatness to preserve the coherent x-ray FEL wavefront. The peak brightness curves for LCLS-I are shown in Fig. B2, this page. For comparison, the figure includes the expected performance of the European XFEL (operation planned for 2016) and the Japanese XFEL facility SACLA , which is located adjacent to the SPring-8 synchrotron source. Likewise, the projected brightness performance for LCLS-II is shown. Not shown are peak brightness curves from a typical undulator on a third-generation synchrotron source. The peak brightness from such sources is in the 10\u00b2 to 10\u00b2\u00b2 range on this scale. LCLS Instruments As previously noted (see also Fig. B1, p. 47 ), the initial-phase LCLS scientific user facility includes six instruments. Five of these instruments are now in regular user-scheduled operation; the remaining one is in the installation phase and is anticipated to be operational during FY 2012. Each instrument is supported by a team led by two staff scientists. Currently, the instruments operate in a serial mode, but techniques for beam sharing in the hard x-ray region are being developed, in particular large offset monochromators equipped with a thin Bragg crystal that transmits part of the x-ray beam. Space limita-tions in this document allow only a brief overview of each instrument, but more detail is provided for three instruments that have or potentially will have more biological applications. Detailed optical configura-tion, operational parameters, and other information for all six instruments can be found online: slacportal. slac.stanford.edu/sites/lcls_public/instruments/Pages/ default.aspx. Atomic, Molecular, and Optical (AMO) Science Instrument - in operation The AMO instrument is located on one of the soft x-ray branches of LCLS and delivers soft x-rays (480 to 2,000 e V). Instrumentation is designed to minimize losses and deliver the maximum possible soft x-ray intensity (up to 1,013 photons per pulse) to the interaction region. The AMO instrument can be configured with a variety of sampling systems and detectors. Gaseous targets of atoms, molecules, clusters, and other nanoscale objects such as protein crystals or viruses typically are used in the AMO instrument. Electrons and ions are detected with a variety of time-of-flight and imaging spectrometers. Large charged-coupled device ( CCD ) area detectors sensitive to x-rays are used for x-ray diffraction measurements. Science performed with the AMO instrumentation includes fundamental studies of light-matter interactions in the extreme x-ray intensity and high fields of the LCLS FEL beam; time-resolved photoionization; nanometer-resolution imaging of nonreproducible objects. A minimal set of optics is used to preserve the high peak brightness and deliver the LCLS beam to the target in the AMO instrument. Three soft x-ray offset mirrors direct the beam to the soft x-ray branches, and two planar, elliptically bent Kirkpatrick-Baez mirrors are used to focus the beam to ~1 \u00b5m in the first interaction region within the high-field physics chamber. The mirrors can be bent to various radii, allowing the focus to be moved along the beam or the size of the beam in the interaction region to be varied as desired by the experiment. At the more downstream interaction region in either the \" CAMP chamber\" or the \"Diagnostics chamber,\" focal spot sizes of ~3 to 5 \u00b5m can be achieved. [Note that the Center for Free-Electron Laser Science ( CFEL ) Advanced Study Group Multipurpose Chamber ( CAMP ) was provided by a consortium of Ger - man institutions.] A high-power, synchronized Ti:Sapphire optical laser is available for all experiments using the AMO instrument, and a variety of wavelengths can be provided. Typically, an 800 nm beam is delivered to the AMO hutch, 49 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Appendix B: Linac Coherent Light Source I and II Facility Paperwith wavelength conversion carried out in the hutch with doubling and tripling crystals for shorter wavelengths and an optical parametric amplifier ( OPA ) for longer wave- lengths. Additional lasers have been installed in the hutch (e.g., a Nd:YAG laser) for specific experiments. Soft X-Ray Materials Science (SXR) - in operation The SXR instrument was designed and built by a consortium of institutions in collaboration with LCLS . Located in the near experimental hall, SXR provides intense, ultrashort soft x-ray LCLS pulses. The instrument provides for a highly diverse set of experimental configurations using established and power - ful tools such as x-ray emission, coherent imaging, resonant scattering, photoelectron spectroscopy, and x-ray absorption spectroscopy. The science that can be performed at the SXR beamline covers widespread fields such as catalysis, astrophys - ics, magnetism, correlated materials, clusters, and biological structure at lower resolution. The instrument is equipped with a monochromator whose energy range (500 to 2,000 e V) cov - ers several of the important K and L edges of the second- and third-row elements for resonant excitation with a resolving power on the order of 4,000. Consortium members and various collaborators can roll up and connect different end stations and detectors to the instrument for the experimental program. These capabilities are also available to general users. X-Ray Pump Probe (XPP) - in operation The XPP instrument is located in Hutch 3 of the near experimental hall and is designed for pump-probe experi - ments. In these studies, a synchronized fast optical laser (Ti:Sapphire) is used to generate transient states of matter, and the hard x-ray pulses from LCLS (4 to 25 ke V using first and third undulator harmonics) are used to probe the structural dynamics initiated by the laser excitation. The x-ray scattering and emission are detected via a custom area detector designed to operate at a repetition rate of 120 Hz and capable of integrating thousands of photons per pixel in a single shot. The instrument design emphasizes versatility. T o maximize the range of phenomena that can be excited, manipulating the laser pulse energy, frequency, and temporal profile is possible. X-ray scattering is the dominant tool for probing the laser-induced structural changes. These experiments require the union of four experimental capaci - ties: generation and delivery of x-ray and laser pulses to the sample, preparation of the excited state in the sample, and detection of the x-ray scattering pattern. Scientific objec - tives include the study of biological, chemical, and physical processes that involve the time-dependent transformation of matter on the atomic scale. Examples of these processes with technological and environmental significance are photosynthetic generation of chemical energy, catalytic production of fertilizer, chemical degradation of pollutants, and melting of ice. These structural transformations involve the motion of electrons, atoms, and molecules over very short distances (10 - m) and time scales (10-\u00b9\u00b2 s). Though much has been learned about these dynamical processes from previous work, particularly studies using optical lasers, no existing technology can provide direct observation of atomic motions on ultrafast time scales. Coherent X-Ray Imaging Instrument (CXI) - in operation The CXI instrument is located in the far experimental hall and is designed to deliver hard x-ray pulses from LCLS (4 to 10 ke V fundamental and up to 25 ke V using higher harmon- ics) for diffraction and imaging experiments with submicron periodic and nonperiodic materials. The transverse coherence of LCLS allows single nanoscale particles to be imaged at high resolution, while the short pulse duration will limit radiation damage during the measurement through an approach often referred to as \"diffract and destroy. \" Maximum per-pulse fluxes delivered by the CXI instrument are in the range of 10 \u00b9\u00b9 to 10 \u00b9\u00b2 photons per pulse, and pulse lengths are as short as ~5 to 80 fs. Samples can be inserted into the beam using several means, including those fixed on substrates or free-standing particles injected into the beam. High-quality focusing optics will generate three foci: ~100 nm, 1 to 2 \u00b5m, and 10 \u00b5m. The two smallest focal spot sizes are achieved using Kirkpatrick-Baez mirror systems with the highest-achievable surface quality to preserve the LCLS wavefront. Two complete end stations, capable of operating in series and including vacuum sample chambers and sample delivery systems, exist at the CXI instrument. These end stations con- tain custom-made pixel array detectors known as CS-PAD s (Cornell SLAC Pixel Array Detectors). Each CS-PAD contains 1,520 by 1,520 pixels of 110 \u00b5m pitch that are individually read out at 120 Hz, allowing each shot of LCLS to be measured and stored independently. Each pixel contains the electronics necessary to convert the analog photon signal created in its sensor to a digital signal, which is suitable for transmission to the data acquisition system. This design enables researchers to change the behavior, specifically the dynamic range and sensitivity, on a pixel-by-pixel basis. In the so-called low-gain mode, each pixel has a dynamic range corresponding to almost 10 at a photon energy of 8 ke V; while in the high-gain mode, the dynamic range is 10\u00b3 and a single photon event can be detected with a >3 signal-to-noise ratio. The design of each end station allows multiple, identical copies of reproducible objects to be sequentially illuminated by the LCLS beam. With each sample oriented randomly, the high data rate and single-shot readout of the detector are critical to building the complete, three-dimensional (3d) set of diffracted intensities required for any structural determination. One objective of the bioscience experiments on the CXI instrument is to allow imaging of biological samples beyond the damage limit that cannot be overcome with synchro-tron sources. The first CXI user experiments performed in February 2011 demonstrated the unique capabilities of the instrument with great success. In particular, during a period of roughly 1 week, protein nanocrystals were injected into the LCLS x-ray beam, resulting in the unambiguous observation LCLS I and II FacilityLCLS I and II Facility50 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Appendix B: Linac Coherent Light Source I and II Facility Paperof Bragg peaks up to better than 3 \u00c5 in all cases and better than 2 \u00c5 in some cases. Promisingly, in these latter cases the resolution was primarily limited by the clear aperture of the sample injector that can be removed in future experiments, potentially increasing the resolution of the final structure even further. This experiment collected over 120 terabytes ( TB) of data, highlighting the challenges in data processing and analysis at LCLS . These experiments benefit from the highest x-ray intensities achievable; that is, the greatest num- ber of photons per unit area per unit time, with pulses ideally about 10 fs in duration. LCLS-II will increase the intensities achievable for such experiments. X-Ray Correlation Spectroscopy (XCS) - in operation The XCS instrument is located in Hutch 4 of the LCLS far experimental hall, about 420 m away from the source. Characteristic time scales ranging from 10 milliseconds (ms) to thousands of seconds can be explored using a sequential mode of operation. Ultrafast time scales ranging from ~100 fs to several nanoseconds can be probed using a novel \"split and delay\" mode of operation. The unprec - edented brilliance and narrow pulse duration of LCLS pro - vide a unique opportunity to observe dynamical changes of large groups of atoms in condensed matter systems over a wide range of time scales using coherent x-ray scattering in general and x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy ( XPCS ) in particular. The XCS instrument will allow the study of equilibrium and nonequilibrium dynamics in disordered or modulated materials. Matter in Extreme Conditions (MEC) - in installation, operation in 2012 The MEC instrument also is located in the far experimental hall. It is designed to combine the unique LCLS x-ray beam with high-power optical lasers to create and study unique phases of matter under extreme conditions. In particular, states of matter that have solid density but temperatures ranging from a couple to hundreds of electron volts, with corresponding pressures of multiple megabars, will be studied. The main body of MEC users will come from the research disciplines studying warm dense-matter physics, high-pressure physics, shock physics, and high-energy density science. The MEC instrument will include a suite of dedicated diagnostics tailored for these fields of science, including an x-ray Thomson scattering spectrometer, an extreme ultraviolet ( XUV ) spectrometer, a Fourier for any reflector ( VISAR ). All diagnostics will be located in a large vacuum target chamber, making the end station very versatile for any investigation of laser-pumped matter that needs a vacuum.LCLS Early Operations Phase For many years, it has been recognized that the \"interaction\" between the XFEL user and \"the machine\" would be different, more interactive for free-electron laser facilities compared with synchrotron radiation storage ring-based facilities. Just how different it turned out to be may not have been fully appreciated. During the design of LCLS , emphasis was placed on creating a facility capable of maximum single-shot brightness. During commissioning, emphasis was placed on early achievement of well-defined performance goals with stability and reliability. Early attainment of these goals opened the door to exploration of other flexibilities. From its inception, the science community and the LCLS machine designers knew that the baseline wavelength range, 800 e V to 8 ke V, could be extended if the electron beam quality was good enough. LCLS now routinely operates at energies from 480 e V (below the oxygen K edge) up to 10 ke V. Recently, the high energy limit has been further extended with the installation of a section of undulators that are tuned to the second harmonic (\"afterburner\"). This second harmonic afterburner ( SHAB ) provides up to 10% of the first harmonic pulse energy at photon energies up to 18 ke V. The most welcome surprise to LCLS users has been the easy adjustability of pulse length and the availability of <10 fs pulses based on the \"low-charge\" mode of operation men-tioned earlier. Options for producing very short LCLS x-ray pulses were developed and tested from 2006 to 2008 while LCLS construction was under way. Implementation for user experiments began in late 2009. LCLS can now deliver pulse lengths for soft x-rays from below 10 fs up to 500 fs, and for hard x-rays from below 10 fs to 100 fs. The users immediately took advantage of this capability in the very first experiments. LCLS today runs much more like a \"laser in the lab,\" where experimenters vary photon wavelength, per-pulse energy, and pulse duration\u2014not on an experiment-by-experiment but on a shift or even hourly basis\u2014as they explore the new potential and scientific possibilities that LCLS provides. As the LCLS science program is now showing, a stable and reliable wavelength reach is only one ingredient of success. Experimenters also need full control of the photon beam and the ability to vary all parameters in the course of a single experiment to understand the time scale of the dynamical proc e sses they study or else to ascertain that they are measur- ing \"static\" properties unperturbed by the LCLS x-ray pulse itself. Real-time flexibility to change parameters has been critical to the success of the first LCLS experiments. This is clearly a paradigm shift for the design of LCLS upgrades and future facilities. LCLS User Program LCLS management works very closely with the LCLS Scientific Advisory Committee ( SAC ), LCLS Proposal Review Panel (PRP LCLS Users' Executive Committee ( UEC ) to develop a fair and transparent external peer-review process 51 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Appendix B: Linac Coherent Light Source I and II Facility Paperfor beam-time proposals and user access. LCLS proposal review and ranking are carried out by the PRP , which includes over 50 international experts grouped into seven subpanels: Atomic, Molecular, Optical, and Cluster Physics; Biology and Life Sciences; Chemistry; Materials\u2014Hard Condensed Matter; Matter; High Energy Density Science/Matter in Extreme Conditions; and Methods and Instrumentation. The work of the PRP for each run begins shortly after each call for proposals is closed and generally ends with an onsite meeting at SLAC twice per year, approximately 3 months after the proposal deadline, where a ranking of the proposals is provided. LCLS management and staff help to facilitate the review process but are not involved in the review and ranking. A description of the proposal review proc e ss can be found on the LCLS website ( www-ssrl. slac.stanford.edu/lcls/users/proposals.html ). Interest in using LCLS has been steadily increasing, with 427 proposals submitted to date. The LCLS scientific community is forming larger teams of collaborators than typically seen with experiments at synchrotron facilities. Some 1,100 dif - ferent scientists are currently affiliated with these proposals, which have been received from 200 institutions in more than 20 countries. Of the 427 proposals submitted through the end of 2010, 87 have been scheduled. In addition, ~20% of the proposals submitted thus far are classified in the general area of structural biology or biosciences. Given the excitement in the community about the first published LCLS experiments on nanocrystals and large viruses (Chapman et al. 2011; Seibert et al. 2011), this percentage conceivably could grow substantially in the future. LCLS-II Given the rapid commissioning and operation of LCLS-I , SLAC and DOE recognized the need to immediately begin planning for the future. The expansion of LCLS (the LCLS-II project) is hence already under way, and, given adequate and timely funding, completion is anticipated by 2018. DOE has provided CD0 (statement of mission need), and the DOE CD1 Lehman Review was held at SLAC in April 2011. The outcome was the recommendation to DOE for approval of CD1 for the LCLS-II project. Over the last 2 years, key advances and devel- opments have led to the recognition that the capabilities and capacity of LCLS can be significantly improved, further enabling new scientific breakthroughs. The recognition of the capability gap between what exists and what is possible is due partly to the remarkable performance of LCLS , which has already far exceeded its design goals. The landscape has changed through (1) the demonstration of the self-amplified spontaneous emission ( SASE ) lasing process at the high- est envisioned energy of 8 ke V, (2) the reduced length of undulators needed because of the high quality and brightness of the electron beam, and (3) the operational stability and reliability of the SLAC linac in the >95% range, comparable to storage-ring sources.LCLS-II will build on a reliable platform for future improve- ments and proceed with the construction of a second electron beam source, which will independently serve another undula - tor x-ray source. Variable gap undulators will be constructed to extend the photon energy range and control, and novel con-cepts like short undulator \"afterburners\" for energy extension, pulse control, and polarization control will be implemented. In addition, photon seeding techniques to produce x-ray beams with increased peak brightness that are completely longitudi - nally coherent will be pursued. The existence of more than one undulator x-ray source will offer the opportunity to combine two beams for two-color pump-probe studies of excited states. Such pump-probe studies are furthermore extended by use of high-field THz radiation to trigger chemical reactions and promote materials into new transient states. These concepts form the basis of LCLS-II , which also addresses the looming reality of insufficient capacity and limited capability of LCLS to accommodate the fast-growing number of users excited by the early success of LCLS . From the beginning, LCLS conventional facilities were designed to support rapid extension of their capabilities and capacity, and LCLS-II leverages this design to remain at the international forefront even as new facilities around the world are completed. LCLS-II is also a natural next step in a larger DOE Office of Science photon science strategy that involves a suite of world-class complementary facilities and tools covering the x-ray energy spectrum with diverse timing capabili-ties. LCLS-II complements existing facilities\u2014such as the Advanced Light Source, Advanced Photon Source ( APS), National Synchrotron Light NSLS-II ) based on storage rings by opening up the combined domain of ultrasmall and ultra-fast. LCLS-II leverages the early LCLS success into continued U.S. leadership. A limitation of LCLS is its limited user access, determined by the availability of only a single linac beam and one fixed-gap undulator source that can supply x-rays at a repetition rate of 120 Hz to only one of six experimental stations at a time. LCLS-II will overcome this roadblock by the creation of two independent linac beams of different and independent prop - erties. The high-energy electron beam from one injector will be used to create hard x-rays by means of two in-series undu-lators, with the second one acting as a second harmonic afterburner that creates x-rays at twice the energy. By using semitransparent monochromator crystals to create offset x-ray beams, two LCLS hard x-ray instruments can be served simultaneously with monochromatic x-rays. The transmitted beam is not monochromatized and serves the other two hard x-ray instruments with a broader bandpass and higher power beam. This way, three of the four hard x-ray stations can operate simultaneously. The lower-energy beam from the second injector is converted by two independent undu-lators into two soft x-ray beams with independently tunable energies and slightly offset paths. These beams serve the two LCLS soft x-ray stations independently and simultaneously. LCLS I and II FacilityLCLS I and II Facility52 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Appendix B: Linac Coherent Light Source I and II Facility PaperIn summary, it will become possible to supply five of the six experimental stations simultaneously with 120 Hz x-ray pulses. This capacity increase of LCLS-II by a factor of 5 transforms the character of LCLS , initially scoped to be a facility with revolutionary capabilities serving a small num-ber of specialized users, toward a higher-capacity general user facility. The current spectral range of LCLS is limited to around 480 to 10,000 e V, and LCLS does not allow rapid energy tuning and full control of pulse properties such as intensity, length, and polarization. The present capabilities limit the scientific exploration of several important problems. Based on the initial performance of LCLS , we now have the confidence to overcome these limitations. Realistically, the hard x-ray limit can now be extended from 10 up to 20 ke V in the fundamental (up to 24 ke V in harmonics) and the soft x-ray limit from 480 e V down to 200 e V. LCLS-II will provide any desired polarization state of light\u2014linear, circular, or elliptical instead of a single linear polarization state. This is accomplished by adding special short undulators (of order 5 m) that maintain the order within the electron bunch but redirect its motion. LCLS-II will provide the capability to control the pulse length and longitudinal coherence by \"self seeding\" (i.e., by monochromatizing radiation from a first SASE undulator and reinserting it superimposed on the electron bunch in a second undulator). The predicted peak brightness of LCLS-II with this seeding scheme is illustrated in Fig. B2, p. 48 , in comparison with LCLS-I and the projected brightness of XFEL s under construction. In the soft x-ray range, other seeding schemes also will be explored, such as Enhanced Echo Harmonic Generation ( EEHG ). The envisioned LCLS-II time scale with consecutive improvement steps between 2012 and 2017 over - laps international XFEL developments in Europe and Japan and constitutes a measured U.S. response to the international competition. It assures international competitiveness of the U.S. x-ray program beyond 2015. T o summarize, in the baseline scope LCLS-II is being planned to provide the following capabilities: Two independent injectors using two linac sections (14 GeV each). One fixed-gap hard x-ray undulator with seeding option (2 to 20 ke V). One variable-gap hard x-ray SASE undulator (2 to 13 ke V). One variable soft x-ray SASE undulator (200 to 2 ke V). Six experimental stations, up to four operating simultaneously. In addition, upgrades to the LCLS-II baseline scope that require nonproject funding include: H igh-field THz sources for novel pump-probe experiments. R apid tuning ability of x-ray energy and polarization delivered by the soft x-ray undulator sources. Option of seeded soft and hard x-rays with improved pulse control and transform-limited pulses. LCLS-II capitalizes on the remarkable early success of LCLS , the excitement and engagement of the international scien-tific user community, and the strong demand for additional capabilities. LCLS-II utilizes the existing infrastructure of SLAC and presents a measured response to international competition. SSRL upgrades and developments support its excellent user program in targeted areas and will further align this program with the science directions of LCLS (espe- cially time-resolved studies), the SLAC -specific parts of U.S. energy initiatives, and the larger West Coast light source strategy. The synergistic SSRL and LCLS strategy couples the spatial and temporal regimes and helps optimize the limited availability of LCLS beam time to the collective benefit of the scientific user community.

Nanocrystallography and Mitigating Radiation Damage LCLS Experiments with Photosystem John Spence, Arizona State University; and many collaborators Recent experiments with photosystem I ( PS I) nanocrystals demonstrate that LCLS opens up exciting new possibilities in macromolecular crystallography, especially for crystals that are too small for synchrotron beamlines. Radiation damage is what limits structure determination at high resolution. For example, x-rays may ionize the sample and cause it to degrade. By using LCLS femtosecond pulses, many more photons can be delivered onto the sample than is possible with conventional light sources, thus providing strong diffraction patterns in a very short time. In the process, the crystal completely vapor - izes in a plasma but only after the x-ray pulse has already passed through the sample if the pulse is short enough (the atoms have mass, and their inertia keeps them in place longer than the flash of x-rays takes to generate the diffraction pattern). There are about 10 12-13 photons in a single femtosecond LCLS pulse (depending on photon energy), which is enough to obtain diffraction patterns from much smaller crystals than those needed for synchrotron studies in a single LCLS shot.Linac Coherent Light Source LCLS: Impacts and Future Potential in Biology Diffraction images have been obtained from PS I crystals of only 6 unit cells across (a = b = 281 \u00c5, c = 165 \u00c5), initially at relatively low resolution (see Fig. B3, this page; Chapman et al. 2011). In the most recent LCLS experiments on PS I, carried out at the CXI beamline using 1.3 \u00c5 wavelength x-rays with a 40 fs pulse width, diffraction was observed to 3 \u00c5 resolution (see the accompanying LCLS Facility Paper, p. 49 , for a description of the CXI beamline and detector). Since the sample is completely destroyed in a single shot, the x-ray beam must be replenished constantly with new crystals. One approach carries the crystals in a liquid and then flows that suspension in a jet across the x-ray beam. However, to minimize absorption and background and ensure the crystals are targeted to the 3 \u00b5m-diam x-ray beam, the jet also must be of similar dimensions. Making such small-diameter water beams is a challenging problem and is even harder with crystals in solution, which can cause small nozzles to clog. As a first solution to this problem, DePonte and colleagues (DePonte et al. 2008) developed a liquid jet-injection method consisting of a coaxial gas flow to focus the water Fig. B3.

One way to think of a nanocrystal experiment is like powder diffraction measured one crystallite at a time. However, unlike in powder diffraction, the patterns from every single crystal can be indexed, oriented, and then and merged into a dataset of three-dimensional (3D ) structure factors. These data are roughly equivalent to those obtained by rotating a single crystal in a conventional monochromatic synchrotron beam. This approach was demonstrated for data collected on PS I at the AMO beamline at LCLS in June 2010, resulting in 15,000 usable diffraction patterns (out of about 1.5 million images) at a resolu-tion of ~9 \u00c5. Upon indexing each individual pattern, the partial intensities were summed for each Bragg index. On average, each structure factor in the entire 3D dataset was observed in about 1,000 patterns. Accordingly, the sum of all these partial intensities is related to an average over all the random orienta - tions and different shapes and sizes of crystals. Just as a powder ring gives an accurate measure of a structure factor (if it is well separated from other rings), these summed partial intensities give potentially similarly accurate measurements for each Bragg peak. Refinement of the PS I structure against the merged LCLS diffraction data produced electron density maps at ~ 9 \u00c5 resolution. These maps were comparable to diffraction data (truncated to 9 \u00c5 resolution) collected at the Advanced Light Source at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Chapman et al. 2011). Key Opportunities and Challenges for Nanocrystallography The PS I LCLS studies (Chapman et al. 2011) and more recent experiments carried out by Boutet, Chapman, Fromme, Schlichting, and collaborators demonstrate the feasibility of nanocrystallography experiments. These experiments also indicate a number of potential advantages of this method (compared to conventional synchrotron-based data col - lection) that could transform structural studies in biology. Advantages include: Di ffraction data can be acquired from crystals too small or too radiation-sensitive for meaningful collection of dif-fraction data at synchrotron beamlines. C rystals that are very mosaic when grown to micron size might be significantly less mosaic when grown to a size of a few hundred nanometers, potentially producing higher-quality and higher-resolution diffraction patterns. C rystal diffraction is measured at room temperature rather than cryogenic temperatures. Furthermore, the crystals can be studied in their crystallization buffer with-out having to add cryoprotectants. M ixing experiments can be performed to flow samples under different conditions into the x-ray beam. The me thod can be used for time-resolved measurements (~100 fs) for the study of optically triggered reactions. The me thod might enable low-resolution phasing based on oversampling the diffraction pattern (e.g., Spence and collaborators, Arizona State University). Despite these advances, many challenges need to be addressed to make nanocrystallography useful for the most difficult problems in biology (see below for a particular example). These challenges provide rich opportunities for research and development ( R&D ) at LCLS , with strong connection to the facilities and R&D activities within the Structural Molecular Biology program at SSRL . Furthermore, LCLS is establishing general user facilities for such studies, again resting on the rich tradition and strong expertise at SSRL . Characterization of Nanocrystals. If crystals are too small to allow visualization in a standard optical microscope, other techniques must be developed to characterize such crystals. SSRL Structural Molecular Biology beamline 4-2 now enables automatic collection of small-angle x-ray diffraction patterns of a large number of samples. The appearance of a pseudopowder diffraction pattern can be used as an indicator for the presence of small crystals in the solution. Such an approach could include the exploration of lipidic cubic phase matrices to correlate precipitant, protein, and lipidic phases in sample holders that contain a large number of individual samples to identify protocols that provide the best crystallization conditions. This approach could be coupled with optical spectroscopy mea - surements to characterize the samples. Experimental Phasing. An adaptation of multiwave- length anomalous dispersion ( MAD )/single-wavelength anomalous dispersion ( SAD ) methods conceivably can be applied to the high-intensity regime of femtosecond LCLS experiments at different wavelengths. Based on a nonrela - tivistic Hartree-Fock-Slater method, the fluence-dependent scattering factors of heavy elements have been computed (Chapman and collaborators). Despite the extensive (and varied) electronic reconfiguration of these elements that occurs during intense x-ray LCLS pulses, existing MAD/SAD phasing algorithms can be applied to the analysis of MAD/ SAD LCLS diffraction data. Furthermore, the high intensity can increase the anomalous signals, and the \"bleaching\" of scattering factors potentially may provide useful informa - tion (e.g., radiation damage-induced phasing, or \" RIP\"). However, a major challenge will be posed by the relatively small anomalous and dispersive signals from such MAD/ SAD experiments. Since \"inverse beam\" or crystal align- ment approaches will not be possible, this method might be restricted to relatively strong anomalous scatterers, such as those in the lanthanide series. Exploratory experiments are planned to assess this question by Chapman ( DESY ) in collaboration with the Weis and Brunger groups at Stan-ford University. Sample Delivery. The current sample requirements for a liquid jet-injection system must be reduced. For example, in the nanocrystal experiment on PS I (Chapman et al. 55 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Appendix B: Linac Coherent Light Source I and II Science PaperLCLS I and II Science2011), the liquid jet injector was operated for 17 hours at 10 microliters (\u00b5 L) per minute (equaling 10 m L of solution utilized). The overall protein concentration was 1 mg/m L, so the total sample requirement was 10 mg of nanocrystals. For this experiment, LCLS operated at 30 Hz; thus at 120 Hz (currently used at LCLS ), the sample requirement would have been ~2.5 mg of nanocrystals. Still, this is a large amount of sample, especially for the difficult cases of large protein complexes or membrane proteins. Currently, most of the suspension flows past the beam without ever being exposed to x-rays. The volume of liquid that interacts with a single pulse is about 4\u00b3 microns, 120 times per second, or 5 \u00d7 10 -4 \u00b5L per minute. Thus, only about 5 \u00d7 10-5 of the suspension is utilized. This wasteful situation could be improved by pulsing the jet, although efforts to do so have produced larger-sized drops that give higher background. Alternatively, by recirculating the suspension, more of the crystals would have a chance to be hit by the LCLS x-ray pulses, which will slowly deplete the suspension of crystals. Furthermore, Spence and collaborators are developing mix - ing jets, consisting of double-bored capillaries. As crystal sizes get smaller, the scattering from the fluid medium becomes an increasingly important source of noise. The requirement for a jet with submicron diameters has been demonstrated (DePonte et al. 2008). Another method is to aerosolize the crystals and introduce them to the beam through an aerodynamic lens stack. Used to image virus particles, this method recently has achieved high hit rates by redesigning the gas flow (see Nonperiodic Imaging of Biological Particles, p. 58 ). Sample delivery by liquid jets will not be easy for mem-brane protein crystals grown in lipidic cubic phases. Thus, other sample-delivery systems must be developed by using, for example, chip-based technologies that allow automated rapid translation between individual crystals. All these sample delivery systems are areas of opportunity for R&D at LCLS and could leverage similar ongoing R&D at SSRL . Single-Crystal Data Analysis. The nanocrystallography data-reduction method used for PS I employed a relatively straightforward scheme consisting of autoindexing each suitable diffraction pattern individually and then summing the resulting partial reflections for each individual Bragg index. Numerical calculations showed that summing such \"random sampling\" of partial Bragg intensities eventually converges to the full Bragg intensity (Kirian et al. 2010). However, there is a practical issue in space groups with an inherent indexing ambiguity, giving rise to a \"pseudo - t winned\" dataset when using the simple summation method of individually indexed diffraction patterns. A potentially more serious problem arises when summing partial intensities from many individual crystals because the absorption properties of the individual crystals might vary. Use of \"pink\" pulses versus monochromatic pulses would enable collection of at least some fully recorded Bragg intensities for each diffraction pattern, enabling so-called postrefinement schemes to resolve the indexing ambiguity and to allow scaling between different diffraction patterns. Such a method makes use of several decades of experience in multicrystal data collection. Changes to the way LCLS generates x-rays (utilizing energy-chirping of the electron beam) can produce a somewhat broader bandwidth. Research and development in this area are ongoing at LCLS . (It also is important for spectroscopy applications.) Example of a Difficult System: Mediator Complex Project Leaders: Roger Kornberg and David Bushnell, Stanford University This project exemplifies an important biological system that thus far has eluded structure determination by x-ray crystal-lography with synchrotron light sources. This representative example shows the difficulties encountered on other systems by many leading research groups worldwide. It also illustrates the potentially transformative impact that LCLS will have in biology by enabling the imaging of systems that are out of reach with current methods. The ultimate goal of transcription research is an under - standing of transcription control. In the case of bacteria and bacteriophage, this goal has been largely achieved. T ranscriptional repressor and activator proteins, responsive to environmental stimuli, bind to DNA sequences adjacent to promoters and directly affect RNA polymerase. Repres - sors prevent polym e rase binding to the promoter, while activators contact polymerase and increase its affinity for the promoter or stimulate the transition from a closed to an open polymerase-promoter complex (i.e., formation of a \"transcription bubble\" in which the DNA double helix is melted to facilitate the initiation of transcription). The central components of the transcription machinery are the same in bacteria and eukaryotic cells. The RNA polym - e rases share a conserved core and common transcription mechanism. Initiation factors\u2014sigma in bacteria and a set of general transcription factors ( GTF s) in eukaryotes\u2014are more distantly related but function similarly in promoter recognition, promoter melting, abortive initiation, and pr omoter escape. Where bacterial and eukaryotic systems truly diverge is in the targets of regulatory proteins. In contrast with the direct targeting of RNA polymerase in b acteria, there are intermediary factors in eukaryotes: chr omatin and Mediator. The chromatin of eukaryotes, based on a histone octamer enveloped by DNA , and Media - tor, a giant multiprotein complex, have no counterparts in bacteria. They represent a new layer interposed between regulatory proteins and RNA polymerase. This layer must account for the far greater complexity of regulation in eukaryotes and the consequent capacity for cell differentia - tion and development.56 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental ResearchAppendix B: Linac Coherent Light Source I and II Science PaperWith a reconstituted transcription assay as a guide, Mediator was first purified to homogeneity in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Kim et al. 1994). The purified protein complex had several notable characteristics. It was large and complex, comprising 21 polypeptides, with a total mass of 1 million daltons ( Da). It was isolated in two forms, either alone or in an even larger complex with RNA polymerase II. The purified Mediator not only was required for response to a transcrip-tional activator, but it stimulated basal transcription tenfold in the absence of an activator. The Kornberg group has extended the structural study of Mediator along two lines\u2014crystallization of the entire Mediator and expression and crystallization of Mediator sub-complexes. After some years of effort, the group developed a procedure for obtaining Mediator in a form and amount suitable for crystallization. About 2 mg of pure protein can be obtained from 200 L of cell culture. Crystal conditions were discovered, and, after several rounds of crystal refinement, reproducible growth of 300 \u00d7 200 \u00d7 5 micron plates, which diffract to 20 \u00c5, was achieved. The thinness of the plates, along with radiation damage, could possibly limit the diffrac-tion. Thus, the use of a femtosecond pulse of very high beam intensity might allow collection of meaningful data. This sys-tem, therefore, is a potential candidate for liquid jet-injection experiments at the CXI beamline at LCLS . A conventional goniometer also could be used, along with translation of the crystal after each LCLS pulse. X-Ray Damage-Free Atomic Resolution Structures Project Leaders: S. Michael Soltis, SSRL , and David Fritz, LCLS Recent LCLS experiments demonstrate that crystals of myoglobin can produce high-resolution data. Using the XPP station, data to 1.4 \u00c5 were recorded from ~50 \u00b5m-thick myoglobin crystals [~10 \u00b9\u00b2 photons per second (/s)]. The diffraction data showed no evidence of radiation damage despite vaporization of the sample after each exposure. Although this resolution can be achieved on a conventional synchrotron source with the same number of photons, a structure based on LCLS data could be expected to be free from the effects of radiation damage. Damage-free structures could have considerable impact on detailed mechanistic studies of metallo pr oteins with metals in high valent states, which are particularly susceptible to photoreduction. Higher resolution would also improve time-resolved studies in which subtle structural changes and changes in electron density distributions are anticipated. Methods to prealign samples, perhaps by probing part of the crystal with a con-ventional synchrotron source, could be developed to reduce the number of samples required to collect a complete dataset, with sample delivery through the use of crystallization con-tainment. Another area of R&D would be the development of fluid, jet spray, or crystal suspension systems that could deliver crystals 100 to 500 \u00b5m in size to the LCLS beam target area rapidly and efficiently. Such a benefit could be found, for example, in the studies of photosystem II ( PS II ) single Proc esses, p. 57 ) or in many other examples in which the effects of radiation damage, including facile photoreduction in the crystalline state, are limiting. Time -Resolved Studies of Macromolecules Project Leaders: Philip Anfinrud, Laboratory of Chemical Physics, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health; Ilme Schlichting, Max Planck Institute for Medical Research, Heidelberg, Germany; Dwayne Miller, Max Planck Society, Center for Free-Electron Laser Science, Hamburg LCLS provides the opportunity to extend time-resolved x-ray studies of correlated molecular motion to the chemical time scale. Since the first protein structure was determined just over 50 years ago, the structures of tens of thousands of proteins have been unveiled at or near atomic resolution. Many of these proteins function as molecular machines and are engaged in the making and breaking of chemical bonds. A grand challenge in the biosciences is to understand how such proteins function from a mechanistic point of view. Because the elementary steps in a chemical transformation generally occur on the chemical time scale of femtoseconds, direct observation of these steps requires ultrafast time resolution. In pursuit of this aim, the infra - structure required to conduct time-resolved pump-probe structural studies of proteins has been developed at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Schotte et al. 2003) and more recently at the Advanced Photon Source. Unfortunately, the time resolution attainable at these third-generation synchrotron facilities is currently limited by the x-ray pulse duration to about 100 ps, which is insufficient to observe the primary events that lead to the globally distributed structural changes observed in proteins at the 100 ps time delay. Indeed, ultrafast time-resolved optical and infrared studies of proteins have detected changes occurring on the femtosecond and picosecond time scales (Lim, Jackson, and Anfinrud 1993; Lim, Jackson, and Anfin-rud 1997), but these measurements are capable of probing structural changes only indirectly. During LCLS beam time in December 2010, substantial progress was made toward the goal of characterizing, with near-atomic spatial resolution, the ultrafast structural changes that ultimately lead to the efficient debinding of CO from the Fe-heme in myoglobin. The structural details unveiled from this and subsequent studies will provide stringent constraints for putative models of short-lived intermediates and structural transitions between them and will help describe in atomic detail the mechanisms of protein function. LCLS opens up 57 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Appendix B: Linac Coherent Light Source I and II Science PaperLCLS I and II Sciencethis area of structural dynamics in the femtosecond regime, complementing studies in the longer time regime possible with third-generation synchrotron sources. The planned research described above on myoglobin is illustra - tive of the kinds of structural changes that occur on the femto - second to picosecond time scale. Such changes are central to the mechanisms of action of many biological systems, includ - ing electron transport proteins; other small molecule-binding proteins like the cytochrome P 450s; many metalloprotein enzymes; and photoactive proteins such as the reaction center, bacteriorhodopsin, and photoactive yellow protein ( PYP). In general, the ability to funnel a local distortion into a concerted macroscopic transformation in these proteins represents one of the many fascinating attributes of biological systems. In PYP, for example, trans-to-cis isomerization about a single chromophore double bond, which occurs on the picosecond time scale, introduces strain into the chromophore and the surrounding protein residues. The relaxation from this strain drives all subsequent structural changes in this protein on the nanosecond to second time scale that ultimately lead to signal transduction as shown by the work of Moffat and col - laborators (Rajagopal et al. 2004). Many of these processes are expected to have structural changes that occur in the femto - second to picosecond time range and hence are not accessible using storage ring-based synchrotron radiation. Identifying, for example, the atomic motions that occur during the photoisomerization reaction in PYP or other photoactive proteins would greatly expand the understand-ing of the influence of the protein environment in this and similar systems. By exploiting the laser-pulse pump and the femtosecond x-ray-pulse probe configuration together with pulse x-rays from LCLS , characterizing the evolu- tion of structure over the time course of femtoseconds to nanoseconds will be possible. Time-Resolved Spectroscopy Project Vittal Lawrence Berkeley National LCLS ; and many collaborators The \"collect before destroy\" approach for biological samples enabled by the extremely bright and ultrashort x-ray pulses from LCLS provides an opportunity to overcome the current limitations of synchrotron sources for both spectroscopy and crystallography. An LCLS experiment can be carried out at room temperature unlike the cryogenic conditions in synchro - tron experiments. Only room-temperature spectroscopy and crystallography make feasible the light-induced below. oxygen-evolving ) in PS II catalyzes the to dioxygen. The OEC contains a heteronuclear MnCa cluster that couples the four-electron oxidation of water with the one-electron photochemistry occurring at the PS II reaction center by acting as the locus of charge accumulation. This complex cycles through a series of five intermediate S-states (S to S), representing the number of oxidizing equivalents stored on the OEC , driven by the energy of four successive photons absorbed by the pigments of the PS II reaction center (Kok, Forbush, and McGloin 1970). Once four oxidizing equivalents are accumulated in the OEC (S-state), a spontaneous reaction occurs that results in the release of O and the re-formation of the S-state. Given the role of PS II in maintaining life in the biosphere and the future vision of a renewable energy economy, understanding the structure of the MnCa catalyst and the mechanism of the water oxidation reaction is considered a grand challenge in the biological sciences. Although the detailed chemistry involved in water oxidation is emerging slowly, there still are competing models of structures and mechanisms, and the data currently available have not pro-vided a definitive answer. Synchrotron radiation-based x-ray diffraction has been used to study structures of PS II , currently at a resolution of 1.9 \u00c5 (Zouni et al. 2001; Guskov et al. 2009; Umena et al. 2011; Ferreira et al. 2004). The geometric and electronic structural information of the intact MnCa cluster has been addressed primarily by spectroscopic methods, especially x-ray absorp-tion and emission techniques (Yano et al. 2006). Among these methods, x-ray emission spectroscopy ( XES ) is a pow- erful tool for studying the charge and spin density and ligand environment of the metal site and has been used successfully to probe steady-state isotropic PS II samples. Methods using polarized x-rays and oriented samples were demonstrated to have the potential for significantly increasing the chemical information by orientationally selecting specific transitions, thereby detecting unresolved features (Yano et al. 2007; Bergmann et al. 2002). However, it is unrealistic with third-generation synchrotron sources to follow the time course of the water-oxidation reaction by the weak valence-to-core emission spectrum (K ,, see below) or to collect polarized K XES data (K ,) from single crystals within the threshold of radiation damage. Spectroscopy provides a probe for the integrity of the catalytic MnCa site during crystallography, the electronic structure, and the advancement of S-states during the light-induced reaction, while crystallography provides the structures and orientational information crucial for polar - ized spectroscopy. The K emission peaks of Mn (K , and K , regions) can be used because these transitions are sensitive to the charge and spin states (K ,), ligand environment (K ,) (Pushkar et al. 2010), and polarization (Bergmann et al. 2002). The dichroism is expected to be similar to what was observed in the previous single-crystal x-ray absorption near-edge structure ( XANES ) spectroscopy SSRL (Yano et al. 2006). The K , peak also will be used to determine the integrity for the PS II samples, as already demonstrated by Messinger et al. 2001. A laser 58 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental ResearchAppendix B: Linac Coherent Light Source I and II Science Paperpump, x-ray probe setup is available at the CXI beamline at LCLS . Of particular inter - est is the S - [S] - S tran-sition, where the O-O bond formation and O release occur. A dispersive XES setup on the LCLS CXI beamline will allow simultaneous collec - tion of diffraction data and a certain energy range of the XES spectrum in one shot from each of the PS II crystals in the stream. The wavelength dispersive setup will use a set of 16 ( 4 by 4) cylindrically bent Si( 440 ) analyzer crystals in von Hamos geometry and one or two modules of a pixel array detector ( PAD ) for collecting the emission spectrum in single-photon counting mode, a capability essential to minimize the background signal from the scattered photons (see Fig. B4, this page ). The primary goal is to develop a map of changes in the electronic and geometric structure of the MnCa cluster during the light-induced reaction cycle of water oxidation. Building on the information about the dark-stable S-state, researchers plan to determine the time evolution of the electronic structure of the MnCa cluster, protonation state of the ligated oxygen atoms, and changes in the ligand envi - ronment along the Kok -c ycle. All these measurements are essential to elucidate the mechanism of O-O bond forma - tion and water oxidation in this biological nanomachine. Imaging of Biological Particles Project Leader: Janos Hajdu, Uppsala University, and many collaborators A grand challenge for 21st century biology involves molecular-level structural studies on a living cell, and a first step in this direction is to gain an understanding of key damage processes in micron-sized biological objects (Bergh et al. 2008). Recent results on imaging live picoplankton cells at LCLS show diffraction signal extending to about 10 \u00c5 resolution with a 60 fs FEL pulse of 2 ke V energy (unpub - lished). The cell was alive at the time it met the x-ray pulse. Although further work is required, there is evidence that images at biologically useful resolutions can be obtained from this LCLS -enabled approach.In another project enabled by LCLS , the first images of a sin- gle virus particle, the mimivirus, were obtained (see Fig. B5, p. 59). The figure shows the reconstructed exit wavefronts from two mimivirus particles injected into the AMO chamber at LCLS (Seibert et al. 2011). Mimivirus, the largest known virus, is visible in an optical microscope. It is too big for a full 3D reconstruction by electron microscopy (Xiao et al. 2009), and its core is surrounded by fibrils, preventing crystalliza-tion. A highly efficient aerosol injector was developed for sample delivery to the LCLS x-ray beam. The injector can be used to introduce living cells, viruses, or biomolecules at reduced pressure into the beam. In a more recent experiment at the LCLS AMO beamline (conducted from January to Feb- ruary 2011), a hit rate of 43% was achieved with an improved aerosol injector, producing 1.2 million hits on various viruses in 36 hours (see Fig. B6, p. 59). The coherent diffraction pattern of a nonperiodic object is continuous; in principle, there is a direct way to determine the phases from the pattern for image reconstruction by \"oversampling\" (Fienup 1978). Resolution in single-particle experiments does not depend on sample quality in the same way as in conventional crystallography. Rather, resolution is a function of radiation intensity, pulse duration, and wavelength\u2014all of which are factors controlling ionization and sample movement during exposure. A 3D dataset can be assembled from such diffraction patterns when copies of a reproducible sample are exposed to the beam one by one in random orientations (Huldt, Szoke, and Hajdu 2003; Bortel and Faigel 2007). Damage can be distributed over many cop-ies of the sample in a similar manner as in \"single-molecule\" electron microscopy or in crystallography using multicrystal averaging. Diffraction data from reproducible objects can be enhanced by merging redundant data, and this should be possible even from very weak individual shots (Fung et al. 2009; Loh and Elser 2009). Averaging (in a redundant Fig. B4. Mn K x-ray emission spectrum from a manganese complex collected using an energy-dispersive spectrometer (energy-level diagram for emission processes is at left ). The spectrum was collected using only one analyzer crystal and a Pilatus position- sensitive x-ray detector (PSD) on SSRL beamline10-2. The spectrometer that will be used at LCLS for time-resolved studies will have 16 analyzer crystals and an energy-discriminating PSD. A collection time of ~10 minutes is estimated for a high-quality K , spectrum from PS II crystals at LCLS. [Courtesy of SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory] 59 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Appendix B: Linac Coherent Light Source I and II Science PaperLCLS I and II Sciencedataset) reduces the error in the signal by the square root of the number of patterns that sample the same pixel. The limiting factors here are the accuracy of the orientation infor-mation and heterogeneity in the sample population, both of which will blur the reconstructed image (Maia et al. 2009; Quiney and Nugent 2011). The first experimental demonstra-tion of this concept of 3D structure determination from single shots was achieved using soft x-ray laser diffraction data from aerosolized ellipsoidal nanoparticles (Loh et al. 2010; Bogan et al. 2010). With a nonreproducible object, there is no chance of repeating the experiment to improve the signal, creating a resolution gap between structures for reproducible and nonreproducible objects. Interestingly, the highest possible resolution in a single shot is not necessarily at the shortest possible wavelength (Bergh et al. 2008). Experimental strate-gies, therefore, are different for high-resolution studies on reproducible and nonreproducible objects. In the first experiments at the LCLS AMO beamline, back - ground scattering in the vacuum chamber did not exceed the readout noise of the detectors, nor the noise of the diffuse photon background. This is quite remarkable considering that the number of photons in the LCLS pulse was nearly 100 billion times higher than this background. Analysis tools were developed to generate 2D and 3D images from coherent dif - fraction data (Maia et al. 2010), and new concepts developed for phase retrieval and holography (Marchesini et al. 2008). As LCLS and imaging techniques develop, it will be possible to move toward more-demanding applications and extend the experiments to smaller particles and, ultimately, to single macromolecules. LCLS is rapidly developing to meet the requirements of such demanding scientific applica - tions, and the first tests on single macromolecules were conducted in August 2011. Correlated X-Ray Scattering ( Project Leaders: Sebastian Doniach Pande, Stanford University; John Spence, Arizona State University; and many collaborators. CSX , in principle, should provide much more information about molecular structure than conventional small-angle x-ray scattering ( SAXS ) data. Recently, the first experimen- tal ab initio image reconstruction of a single particle (gold nanorods) was created from the diffraction pattern of an ensemble of randomly oriented copies from its angular correlations. This reconstruction showed that effects of interparticle interference from the partially coherent incident radiation are essentially negated if the particles are also in random positions (Saldin et al. 2011). The measure-ment of correlated scattering events in which a given mol - ecule in the ensemble can scatter two photons within the same x-ray pulse is made possible by the high x-ray bright - ness of the LCLS pulse. Furthermore, recent advances in control of droplet formation and transport into the LCLS beam allow droplets to be formed by mixing an enzyme and its substrate in a continuous flow mixer in a few tens of microseconds. The droplets are then injected toward the x-ray beam at 10 to 20 m/s. By varying the distance to the beam, a series of CSX snapshots may be obtained from mixing at times ranging from ~100 microseconds (\u00b5s) to several milliseconds. The incidence of such CSX events is greatly amplified by the number of macromolecules in the droplet. By correlating scattering events at different pixels in an area detector and defining a pair of scattering vectors ( a nd ), these two-photon events define a Fig. B5.

The corre l ated average is over all pairs of pixels subtending a fixed relative angle and a certain neighborhood around each vector. I(q) represents the usual two-point SAXS scattering averaged over all orientations. There are an estimated 10 protein molecules per droplet, so the cross-correlation is the sum over the CSX profiles for all the conformational states of the molecule occupied at the instant of exposure. Since LCLS x-ray pulses have a duration on the order of 10 fs, the molecules in the droplet do not have time to undergo significant Brownian motion during exposure. Hence, two-photon scattering from any molecule in the ensemble happens for a given molecular orientation and internal conformation. Some 10 correlated two-photon CSX events could be expected from a single micrometer-sized droplet of protein solution at a concen-tration of 10 mg/m L exposed to a single LCLS x-ray pulse focused to an area of ~1 (m)\u00b2. An advantage of CSX relative to the usual single-photon SAXS measurement is that back- ground subtraction is self-generated by the act of correlating the data, with subtraction of the product of average scattering in the two wave vector channels | | and | | . 60 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental ResearchAppendix B: Linac Coherent Light Source I and II Science PaperAn algorithm has been developed to calculate the theoreti-cal XCS profile given the coordinates of a macromolecule. In Fig. B7a, this page, the calculated change in the ordinary SAXS profile, I(q) , is shown for the enzyme cycophilin A (CypA) as it goes from initial to final state conformations. In B7 b, the calculated difference is shown for a slice through the cross-correlation function. The overall magnitude of the difference profile is of order 8% of the individual profiles. The data resulting from time-resolved CSX measurements can be analyzed using an approach in which macromolecular kinetics are simulated using Markov state models built from molecular dynamics simulations. Direct fitting approaches similar to those used for refinement at low resolution in macro mo lecular crystallography (Schroder, Levitt, and Brun- ger 2010) can also be employed.I(q1) q1 q1Fig. B7.

The extreme brightness and coherence of NSLS-II will enable new techniques, such as nanoscale imaging, that currently are either in their infancy or not feasible with present sources. Moreover, NSLS-II will take widely used techniques, such as macromolecular crystallography ( MX), x-ray scatter - ing and x-ray absorption spectroscopy ( XAS ), and extend them to new regimes in time and spatial resolutions that cannot be achieved today. With construction over 50% finished, NSLS-II is on track for completion in March 2014\u201415 months ahead of schedule (see Fig. C1, this page ). When operational, it will replace the original NSLS . The synchrotron storage ring for NSLS-II is oper - ating at 3 gigaelectron volts ( GeV) and 500 milliamperes (m A) to produce electron beams of ultralow emittance [x, y = 0.6, 0.008 nanometer-radians (nm-rad)]. The accelerator design that reaches this emittance features a large ring (circumfer - ence 791.5 m) with relatively soft bend magnets configured in a 30-cell, double-bend achromat that holds 15 long (9.3 m) high- straight sections and 15 short (6.6 m) straight sec - tions, with damping wigglers in 8 of the 15 long straights. The baseline configuration implements damping wigglers in only three of the straights. The straight sections can accommodate a variety of insertion devices including undulators and super - conducting wigglers, large-gap dipoles can be and three-pole wigglers ( 3PWs) can be added at bend positions to shift the critical energy into a spectrum similar to that at the NSLS bends. NSLS-II can accommodate at least 58 independently operat- ing beamlines and potentially many more with canted inser-tion devices and multiple end stations per beamline. These could comprise insertion devices on 15 low- straights and on 12 high- straights, including: D amping potent ( BM) ports for IR. U ltraviolet or soft x-rays from the dipoles or hard x-rays from 3PWs. F our large-gap BM ports for far- IR.National Synchrotron Light Source-II Opportunities for Biological Sciences at NSLS-II * As the brightest synchrotron in the world, NSLS-II will be more than 10,000 times brighter than NSLS . It is designed to enable ~1 nm spatial resolution, ~0.1 me V energy resolution, and diffraction-limited coherence in the vertical at 12 ke V. The baseline construction project for NSLS-II includes six insertion-device beamlines; others are being built with additional funding from the DOE Office of Basic Energy Sciences and other sources. A call for proposals in 2010 generated 54 Beamline Development Proposals, 34 of which were approved. Calls for additional proposals will recur annually, and the 2011 call generated 13 Letters of Intent, including resubmissions as well as new Beamline Development Proposals. NSLS-II Beamlines for Biological Sciences Biological sciences are prominent in the planning for NSLS-II beamlines. Four of the six project beamlines are intended to address biological research interests as well as physical and material science needs. Thirteen of the 34 approved beamlines include substantial biological applications, with biology predominating for 11 of these. Also, four of the new Letters of Intent are exclusively or substantially for biology (see T able C1, p. 64 ). The beamlines planned for NSLS-II are intended to accom- modate both existing science programs and those that will develop in response to new opportunities. Several NSLS-II beamlines currently under development do address future needs of current NSLS users. In addition, however, NSLS-II brightness brings new opportunities both for these disciplines and for techniques that take advantage of the unprece de nted resolutions and coherence at NSLS-II , notably in imaging.

In the long run, NSLS-II will accommodate beamlines addressing other applications. The current beamlines are grouped in the following text into four categories: macromolecular crystallography, scattering, spectroscopy, and imaging. Capabilities and science areas for each beamline now under development are briefly described. The divisions are some-what arbitrary (e.g., a scattering beamline might examine crystals, and an imaging or MX beamline might use spectro - scopic probes), but the beamline descriptions clarify this.

Indeed, designers and planners envision a community of villages embracing the diverse but interconnected sciences that will be represented at NSLS-II beamlines, each of which aspires to be a best-in-class facility in its own realm. T o provide for the full range of experiments needed to address 21st century science, an accommodating user access policy and a comple-ment of science villages have been planned. The Biology Village is a concept that emerged while developing life sciences at NSLS-II beginning in 2007 (www.bnl.gov/nsls2/ sciOps/LifeSci/chronology.asp). Planners anticipate that users will have facile access to multiple beamlines that might be needed for multitechnique approaches, and an integration of techniques and scientific discourse is expected to promote better scientific opportunities. A 2010 white paper for BER elaborates such opportunities (www.bnl.gov/nsls2/docs/PDF/BER-whitepaper-Jan10.pdf).In many respects, the concept of the Biology Village is a virtual one because meaningful interactions for all beam-lines cannot always be physically proximate. Nevertheless, designers strive for compatible geographical placements of beamlines as much as possible. A significant aspect of physical coordination at NSLS-II will relate to the Labora - tory Office Buildings ( LOB s). Three LOB s are being built in the baseline project to house beamline staff and users and to provide laboratory resources in support of synchrotron experiments; two of these will be fully outfitted. The remaining LOB s will be constructed and completed later. T o a large extent, these LOB s will serve as village centers, even though some Biology Village citizens may reside around the ring. Users and staff will have both physical and virtual homes in their village center.

T oday, BER 's scientific user facilities span a wide range of capabilities; however, the challenges associ - ated with biological complexity create a need for new and innovative tools. The National Synchrotron Light Source-II ( NSLS-II ) will provide such tools by offering a range of new or improved techniques enabling multiscale exploration. These tools will aid studies at (1) the molecular level to understand how genes determine biological structure and function, (2) the cellular level to understand how molecular processes are coordinated to execute cell function, and (3) the level of microbial communities and higher organisms to understand how cells interact and respond to their environment. This paper presents examples of significant new experiments with potentially high impact in biological research that will be enabled by NSLS-II .

M ake available high-throughput technologies and a multitechnique approach for correlating genomics with structural and functional information. Atomic-Resolution Structures of Complex Macromolecular Systems Macromolecular crystallography ( MX) is the preeminent method for structural biology worldwide. Its intrinsic value is recognized by the selection committees who, in recent years, awarded five Nobel Prizes in Chemistry to Walker (1997); who all heavily relied upon synchro tr on radiation.The frontier challenges in structural biology now include large macromolecular systems and viruses, membrane pro-teins, protein-protein complexes, and protein-nucleic acid complexes. However, these systems are very difficult to crys-tallize, and the crystals that are obtained often measure only a few microns along an edge. NSLS-II is expected to provide an ideal opportunity to use microcrystals for diffraction studies due to the facility's small electron-beam profile within the storage ring and, consequently, its world-leading x-ray bright-ness and flux density. Furthermore, for complex biological systems incompatible with conventional MX methods, new experimental approaches are under development that will take advantage of other unique characteristics of NSLS-II . Multiprotein Complexes T o date, the most common approach for determining structures of multiprotein complexes is to isolate the individual components, solve their structures separately, and reassemble the complex based on the structures of the individual components. However, stably isolating individual proteins for crystallization often is impossible. Moreover, the complex may not be a simple sum of the individual units; protein-protein interactions, for example, can cause structural alterations during assembly. Thus, crystallization of the entire protein complex is a much more desirable and accurate approach. Y et, diffraction from large multiprotein complexes is generally weak, and crystals, if obtained, are often small. For example, microbial enzymes, including cellulases and hemicellulases, have been shown to efficiently degrade the microcrystalline cellulose structure as multiprotein com-plexes. Caldicellulosiruptor is a group of extreme thermo - philic bacteria known to ferment polymeric carbohydrates at high rates. Integrated genomic and proteomic datasets identified the presence of highly active cellulolytic enzymes and revealed their unusual thermostability. Thus, Caldicellu-losiruptor is a promising anaerobic bacterium for improving high-temperature biomass conversion (Dam et al. 2011). T o date, mass spectrometric analyses have identified numerous multiprotein complexes involved in this fermentation, but no structural details are available. Successful crystallo - graphic analysis of these complexes will require a source whose brightness can be focused efficiently into micron-sized x-ray beams. Indeed, one key advantage that NSLS-II will bring to the global MX community is its ability to determine structures from microcrystalline samples, such as the enzymes that catalyze critical transformation steps in lignocellulose breakdown.National Synchrotron Light Source-II Overview of Significant New Biological Research at NSLS-II73 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Appendix C: National Synchrotron Light Source-II Science PaperMembrane Protein Structures Representing approximately one-third of the known gene sequences, membrane proteins are involved in numerous biological processes that take place at cell and organelle membranes, including cell recognition, signal transduction, chemical sensing, and transportation. Despite the importance of membrane proteins, determining their structure remains a grand challenge in structural biology. The key issue is that these proteins usually have to be extracted from their native environment of cellular and organelle membranes and reconstituted into detergent micelles for structural studies. In addition to potential loss of biological activity during solubi - lization, the presence of detergents makes crystallizing these proteins difficult and precludes extraction of protein-only information from the solution scattering data. Embedding membrane proteins in 2D planar lipid bilay- ers that resemble their native environment in a liquid-like state represents a promising alternative for examining the structures of membrane proteins and their interactions with the lipid membrane. This approach already has had some suc-cess in cryo-electron microscopy studies of 2D membrane protein crystals (Thomas 2001). It also has been adapted for grazing incidence x-ray scattering and diffraction measure-ments, analogous to the transmission solution scattering and crystallographic methods for soluble proteins. In these structures, the x-ray scattering signal is determined by the electron density contrast of the protein against the constant background of the bilayer membrane structure. The contrast not only depends on the protein structure itself, but also varies as a function of protein orientation in the membrane and is even sensitive to membrane deformation from hydro-phobic mismatching. For example, YiiP is a membrane transporter that catalyzes Zn \u00b2+/H+ exchange across the inner membrane of Escherichia coli. With its Y-shaped architec - ture, YiiP dramatically differs from most cylindrically shaped membrane proteins (Lu and Fu 2007). The incorporation of YiiP into the membrane necessitates reorganization of lipids surrounding the irregular transmembrane domain surface to minimize hydrophobic mismatch. The ensuing bilayer deformation would directly impact the active site for zinc transport. Molecular responses to hydrophobic mismatch may have great functional signifi - cance. Emerging evidence sug - gests that a large collection of lipophilic channel modulators act by deforming the bilayer and directly binding to the protein-lipid interface. X-ray scat - tering data from YiiP in planar lipid membranes (see Fig. C7, this page) can reveal how protein conformations change depending on the presence of zinc ions. More importantly, due to the sensitivity of the scattering data to deformation in the lipid membrane structure, modeling these data may reveal the YiiP protein-lipid interface to help understand how lipids may reshape the active site for zinc transport. T o date, there have been reports of x-ray diffraction studies on 2D crystals of membrane-associated proteins (Lenne et al. 2000; Miller et al. 2008) and x-ray scattering studies of plant viruses adsorbed to a lipid membrane resembling a 2D solution (Yang et al. 2009). However, routine application of these methods in structural biology will necessarily entail exceedingly small scattering volumes (e.g., ~5 nm \u00d7 1 cm \u00d7 1 cm). Such studies will require continued technical devel - opment and, more importantly, a bright source like NSLS-II to produce enough protein scattering signal above the water scattering background. Correlated Atomic and Electronic Structure of Metalloenzymes Recent bioinformatics surveys show that approximately 47% of all enzymes with known 3D structures contain metal ions or complex centers (Waldron et al. 2009). Therefore, understanding the relationship between atomic and electronic structure is crucial for obtaining fundamental mechanistic insights into biology. This includes macromolecules involved in processes critical to DOE missions such as photosynthesis and water oxidation; nitrogen gas (N) fixation and nitrogen oxide metabolism; carbon metabolism (e.g., methane and carbon dioxide); hydrogen gas (H) metabolism; oxygen (O) activation; and the sulfur cycle (S and SO x metabolism). For example, H has enormous potential to serve as a renewable NSLS-II Science Fig. C7. Simulated x-ray scattering data from zinc transporter YiiP in a planar lipid bilayer. (A) The calculated scattering intensity of the closed and open conforma- tions of YiiP show qualitative differences. (B) These differences should be detectable as shown in line profiles corresponding to qr = 0.08 \u00c5-\u00b9 (dashed lines) and q z = 0 (solid lines). Note that noise has been simulated for scattering from a 1 cm\u00b2 bilayer sample at the x-ray intensity expected at NSLS-II.

Nature has produced enzymes (hydrogenases) that drive the hydrogen cycle in the biosphere. H also is produced as a byproduct of N fixation by nitrogenase enzymes. In all microbial systems studied to date, the enzymes that catalyze the production of H from 2H + and two electrons are metallo - enzymes, which are among the most efficient H - forming and -consuming catalysts known. Bioproduction of H using microbes must overcome several hurdles before it is commercially viable. For example, hydrog - e nase enzymes are rapidly inactivated in aerobic solution. T argeted bioprospecting thus is necessary to identify and characterize particularly active or stable hydrogenases that can be readily adapted for use in biosolar hydrogen produc - tion. One example is Anabaena sp. strain 7120, in which the enzyme is localized to the microaerobic environment. T o increase this strain's H production, site-directed mutagenesis near the iron-molybdenum cofactor was performed and resulted in several variants that significantly increased their rates of H production (Masukawa et al. 2010). Single-crystal spectroscopy correlated with x-ray diffraction provides a way to promote, trap, and study reaction intermediates within the macromolecular crystal. Such studies will provide strategies to improve H production and further engineer microbial strains for enhanced photobiological production of H in an aerobic, nitrogen-containing environment. Synthetic Biology A major difficulty in converting biomass into biofuels lies in its recalcitrance\u2014the resistance of cellulose to enzymatic breakdown. Sequencing efforts and biochemistry have demonstrated that microbial enzymes are rather slow on their own, but nature has greatly enhanced their reactivity by linking them into large multienzyme collections known as \"cellulosomes. \" However, efforts to reproduce these effects in vitro using purified components have moved slowly (Nordon, Craig, and Foong 2009). As a result, such large multicatalytic complexes have not yet materialized in large-scale bioreactors. Efforts in synthetic biology are under way for creating artifi- cial cellulosomes of very high stability, defined composition, and reactivity tailored for specific substrates. However, structural characterization of these multienzyme complexes is extremely chal-lenging. Though MX has been very successful at determining the structure of individual cellulosome components, a complete cel-lulosome has not yet been solved. Despite high-resolution structures of all individual cellulosome modules, the mechanism of enzymatic synergy remains poorly under-stood. Alternatively, solution x-ray scattering can provide direct shape information on artificial cellulosomes too large for MX. The high-brilliance and high-throughput formats being devel-oped at NSLS-II are ideally suited to the combinatorial nature of artificial cellulosome synthesis (see Fig. C8, this page). With automated high-throughput methods, structural infor-mation can be obtained rapidly from thousands of different designed cellulases. These capabilities have the potential not only to screen the constructs for activity (by enzyme assays), but also to read out shape complementarity directly and tune reactivity to complex substrates. Structural and Chemical Dynamics with Fast Time Resolution Fully understanding the function of multidomain proteins and multiprotein complexes requires understanding the dynamics of protein folding and protein-protein interactions. Though studying protein crystals is difficult, these complex systems can be studied in solution using x-ray scattering, footprinting, and spectroscopy. Transmembrane Protein Signaling Membrane proteins play critical roles in cellular signaling processes and ion (or water) transport across the biological membrane. Many transmembrane proteins contain hydro-phobic cores with strategically placed, charged residues that appear critical for their proper function. Observation of the structural dynamics surrounding these residues, as well as more global conformational changes in the macromolecule on biologically relevant time scales, can provide crucial infor-mation for understanding the mechanisms by which these proteins function. X-ray footprinting of macromolecules is a unique approach for analyzing the solvent accessibility of individual residues in proteins as a function of protein conformation. X-rays generate hydroxyl radicals that covalently label solvent-exposed sites, which subsequently can be detected by mass spectrometry. By using the high x-ray flux from synchrotron radiation, microsecond time resolution can be achieved, providing a time-resolved high-resolution structural picture of solvent-accessible amino acid residues and \"bound\" water molecules.

Barrick, Johns Hopkins University] A B75 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Appendix C: National Synchrotron Light Source-II Science PaperAn example is rhodopsin, a member of a group of proteins called the G protein-coupled receptor ( GPCR ) superfamily. GPCR s exhibit a conformational change when turned \"on,\" leading to interactions with other proteins and sending infor - mation across cell membranes to regulate many important molecular pathways (see Fig. C9, this page). Synchrotron x-ray footprinting has been used to study these different conforma - tional states, providing a molecular map that pinpoints where water molecules sit inside the protein when it is off and on (Angel et al. 2009). Results indicate that water molecules rear - range in response to the protein being turned on and interact with key areas necessary for the protein's function. Under - standing how these proteins and associated signaling pathways are controlled can have a large impact. Achieving higher x-ray flux density is the major barrier to providing high signal-to-noise footprinting data for the exploration of protein dynamics on shorter time scales. The damping wiggler insertion device at NSLS-II is expected to provide world-leading flux in the energy range of interest and would represent an entirely unique international resource. Combinatorial Enzyme Kinetics Developing pretreatment chemistries with the associated enzymes to convert plant biomass to fermentable sugars for the cellulosic biofuels industry is a multifaceted effort. Work involves identifying enzymes expressed in bacteria and fungi; extracting, characterizing, and modifying the resulting proteins; and producing and testing them in a realistic biochemical assay. New methods are desired for all of these characterization steps to better understand decon-struction mechanisms.High enzyme loading is a major economic bottleneck for the commercial processing of pretreated lignocellulosic biomass to produce fermentable sugars (Gao et al. 2011). Optimizing the enzyme cocktail for specific types of pretreated biomass enables a significant reduction in enzyme loading without sacrificing hydrolysis yield. One approach to enzyme mixture development uses liquid robotics to explore full-factorial combinations of multiple (>10) enzymes, a method that can be efficiently performed in multiwell plates. This approach is suited to complementary high-throughput synchrotron structural measurements of plant materials dur - ing and after enzyme action. MX may be used to determine enzyme structures and thus help to elucidate function. SAXS and WAXS measurements can be conducted through an aqueous medium and quantify the breakdown of crystalline cellulose, hemicellulose, and other tissue structures. X-ray footprinting can probe tertiary structures in physiologically relevant solutions on millisecond time scales, and synchro - tron spectroscopy techniques are available for probing dif - ferent aspects of chemical and physical order in samples. Electron Transport Flavin-dependent proteins catalyze a wide range of biochemi - cal reactions\u2014including aerobic and anaerobic metabolism, light emission, photosynthesis, DNA repair, plant photo - tr opism, and the activation of oxygen for hydroxylation and oxidation reactions. While flavin adducts are critical interme-diates in many flavoenzyme reactions, they rarely are detected even by rapid transient kinetics methods because of their high reactivity. Thus, electron transport in these systems requires a combination of structural and spectrophotometric analyses for characterizing the transient intermediates. As betaine aldehyde enzyme-bound intermediate. The crystal structure of choline oxidase revealed the presence of a C 4a- oxygen adduct. The structure of the trapped flavin adduct derives from aerobic crystals of choline oxidase temperatures. Correlated single-crystal microspectrophotom-etry showed that the adduct forms rapidly in situ at 100 K. The high reduction potential of the enzyme-bound flavin is proposed to promote FAD reduction in the x-ray beam. This also facilitates C4a-O(OH) adduct formation, but an membrane- bound rhodopsin. This approach demonstrates the structural activation of bound waters as a func-tion of receptor signaling status. X-rays ionize water molecules inside and outside the membrane protein to radicals (see OH, glo w- ing spheres) that react with adjacent amino acid side chains. As the protein changes its structure dur - ing signaling, the pattern of water reactivity within the protein changes, reflecting the transmission of the sig-nal through the membrane (see Angel et al. 2009). 76 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental ResearchAppendix C: National Synchrotron Light Source-II Science Papertemperatures prevents the decay of the complex. Thus, the use of complementary methods with time-resolved spectroscopic data and cryogenic temperatures provides a powerful strategy to study reactive intermediates in enzyme catalysis. Nanometer-Resolution Probes for Structural and Chemical Imaging In addition to understanding the molecular-level structures of enzyme systems and how they relate to function, the next step in a systems biology approach is to understand the loca-tion and interactions of these molecules at the cellular level. Lignocellulose Ultrastructure, Chemistry, and Recalcitrance Current understanding of the structural properties of plant cell walls that impart strength and resistance to degradation is limited, hindering development of better strategies for biomass deconstruction. For example, lignin greatly reduces the availability of cellulose for conversion into fermentable simple sugars, therefore lowering the efficiency of biomass conversion to ethanol or other biofuels. Lignocellulosic structure is heterogeneous on the nanoscale, challenging structural visualization. Existing nanoscale imaging techniques, such as electron microscopy, have proven difficult for artifact-free imaging of biomass materials because of the possibly invasive sample preparation needed to meet the electron imaging condition of \"thin sample. \" Thus, new nanoscale imaging approaches are required for visualizing the lignocellulosic network to improve its breakdown efficiency. A newly developed technique, x-ray diffrac - tion microscopy ( XDM ), is a strong candidate for imaging samples that are tens of microns in size and thickness and close to their natural state (see Fig. C10, this page ). XDM relies on the high coherence of advanced synchrotron sources like NSLS-II to image objects at a spatial resolution approaching the diffraction limit of the x-ray photons. The expected reso - lution with biological samples is 5 to 10 nm. In the past, XDM has shown the nanoscale structures of yeast (Shapiro et al. 2005; Huang et al. 2009; Nelson et al. 2010), bacteria (Lima et al. 2009), and chromosomes (Nishino et al. 2009). More recent development of scanning XDM provides unlimited field of view, allow - ing the technique to be applied to samples in more natural environments (Giewekemeyer et al. 2010; Dierolf et al. 2010). With the high brightness of NSLS-II , XDM can provide high- resolution imaging in structural investigations of biological materials\u2014such as crystalline cellulose within plant cell walls\u2014that are not easily accessible by other existing methods. Understanding the chemistry behind the recalcitrance of lignocellulose also is important. Enzymatic degradation offers one solution to the challenges of economically sepa-rating cellulose from lignin, motivating the need to study enzymatic degradation in situ. Scanning transmission x-ray microscopy ( STXM ) can provide chemically specific images of the organic composition of plant cell walls and be used for assessing the chemical effects of enzymatic degradation (Bernard et al. 2009). With the high brightness and broad-band nature of NSLS-II , x-ray beams can be focused efficiently to sub-30 nm. This resolution will enable the visualization of specific locations within the cell wall where cellu losic e nzymes are most active and the determination of the nature of the reaction's chemical byproducts. Microbial Biofilm Ultrastructure, Composition, and Function Microbial communities are known to significantly alter both physical and geochemical conditions in the subsurface. One continuously debated characteristic of a biofilm is its physical structure or morphology, which varies with the microbial species comprising the biofilm and other factors. Naturally, different types of biofilm structures can lead to very different biofilm functions, such as carbon dioxide sequestration and bioremediation capacity. Much of the research on microbial biofilm structure, both from the mathematical modeling and observational perspectives, has been carried out for microorganisms growing on flat substrates in the absence of Fig. C10.

Two-dimensional studies have provided very important insights, but biofilm structures adhering in channel-and-cluster geometry, for example, cannot be described well in two dimensions. Likewise, mass transfer will be very different in 3D versus 2D. Synchrotron-based imaging provides a unique methodol - ogy for quantifying microbial structure in 3D porous media. Conventional x-ray micro-computed tomography ( CT) provides a spatial resolution of 5 to 10 \u00b5m, insufficient to visualize individual microbes in porous media (Davit et al. 2011). However, synchrotron nano- CT and fluorescence tomography are capable of imaging objects in 3D with a spatial resolution approaching 100 nm (Iltis et al. 2011). Imaging can be performed by attaching a suitable x-ray contrast agent to the biophase, either directly or via metal-labeled antibodies to the microorganisms. Ultimately, this approach will allow visualization of a variety of microbial biofilms in natural soils, as well as key contaminants readily imaged by synchrotron x-rays (e.g., U, T c- 99, Sr- 90, Cs- 137, and I-129). Symbiosis at the Plant-Microbe Interface Recent studies have shown that endophytic bacteria in the environment of the plant root can enhance the rate of biomass production (T aghavi 2010). However, very little is known about the mechanism of plant growth promotion or the symbiotic relationship between plant roots and bac - teria. Complex interactions between plant roots, microbes, and soil minerals occur in the rhizosphere\u2014an intricate microenvironment consisting of the few millimeters of soil in the immediate vicinity of plant roots. The rhizosphere is directly influenced by root activity and the associated microbes; a detailed understanding of the biogeochemical interactions occurring within it has been limited by dif - ficulties in observing these micro- and nanoscale processes in situ and in real time. Nanoscale x-ray imaging provides a nonde-structive means to study the struc - ture and transport of materials at the plant-microbe interface (Lombi and Susini 2009). One particular issue for biofuels feedstock production on marginal lands (i.e., those with poor soil fertil-ity) is to understand how endophytic bacteria assist plants in coping with nutrient-limited soil conditions (e.g., iron deficiency). Although needed for photosynthesis, iron is practically insoluble in most soils and natural waters and often is the \"limiting\" micronutrient for plant growth (Awad, R\u00f6mheld, and Marschner 1994). Studying the role of endo-phytic bacteria in iron acquisition for plants grown on marginal soils requires the in situ investiga - tion of the heterogeneity in iron distribution and speciation within the rhizosphere (see C11, unique and powerful methods to study 2D and 3D elemental distributions and asso - ciations on the submicron scale. In addition, nanobeam x-ray absorption spectroscopy ( XAS ) can be used to determine the molecular speciation of an element (e.g., iron) at each pixel of an x-ray fluorescence image. With NSLS-II , biogeo chemical pr ocesses will be observable for the first time at the subcellu- lar level, providing new infor m ation on growth mechanisms. The facility's advanced x-ray detectors also will provide rapid data rates, allowing quick examination of a wide range of root-microbe systems. Microbe-Mineral Interface Interactions A great challenge in biogeochemistry is to understand processes at the microbe-mineral interface (Fredrickson and Zachara 2008). Although the ramifications of microbe-mineral interactions can be seen on a macroscopic scale, a microscopic approach is necessary to understand the underlying processes. Extremely helpful for this challenge is a nanoprobe instrument that can image the interface with very high spatial resolution and concurrently charac t erize it chemically (Benzerara et al. 2005). With its unmatched small emittance, NSLS-II is uniquely suited for high-resolution STXM experiments that will clearly improve knowledge of these processes. As an example, interactions at the microbe-mineral interface in soils and sediments can influence contaminant behavior. DOE 's Genomic Science program has identified a number of microbial systems that have the poten-tial to remediate environmental c For example, Fig. C11. iron and speciation.

These spectra show that root activity altered the solid-phase speciation in the rhizosphere and that roots absorbed aqueous iron released from the weathering of the \"nonlabile\" solid phase. Unplanted controls were nearly identical to bulk soil material, indicating natural microbiota did not significantly alter iron speciation.

Conversely, recent studies have indicated that microorganisms capable of bio-oxidation of U(IV) inhabit uranium-contaminated and -uncontaminated DOE sites. These organisms, including Acidovorax ebreus strain TPSY and Cosmobacter millennium, can utilize U(IV) as the sole electron donor, potentially producing mobile uranium in anoxic environments. Essential to predictably modeling reme-diation efforts based on U(VI) reduction is an understanding of the microorganisms and physiology of anaerobic U(IV) bio-oxidation and the impact of this microbial metabolism on long-term sequestration of uranium in the environment. Genetic Control of Metal Ion Uptake, Transport, and Storage Opportunities to examine how genetic variations in organ- isms affect their interactions with the environment are driven by the rapidly increasing quantity of nucleotide sequence data provided by DOE 's Genomic Science program. In the future, reliance on plants for energy and food will place a strain on already-scarce prime agricultural land, shifting plant production to nutrient-limited soils, and will require growing crops with fewer inputs of primary macronutrients. Optimiz-ing nutrient acquisition and use will rely on information about the genetic control of metal ion uptake, transport, and storage. Functions of ion-transport and -storage genes thus need to be determined. Identifying the organelle in which a particular element accumulates will allow rapid targeting of the genes responsible for these functions. The ability to characterize the function of genes involved in elemental homeostasis requires instrumentation that provides suitably high detection sensitivity at submicrometer spatial resolutions. Additionally, a fundamental requirement for ionomic instrumentation is the ability to implement high-throughput analyses to achieve the required functional analysis of the genes and gene networks directly controlling the ionome. Results then need to be integrated with bioinfor - matic tools. Synchrotron-based x-ray fluorescence imaging techniques are extremely well suited to studies of these inter - actions at the cellular and subcellular level, potentially in vivo . Focused x-ray fluorescence beamlines at NSLS-II will be able to achieve dynamically variable spatial resolutions from just under 1 \u00b5m to tens of nanometers. These beamlines simultane-ously will provide world-leading photon flux to enable high-throughput analysis with an elemental detection sensitivity at the attogram level. Ultimately, relevant data can be obtained using whole-plant, high-resolution x-ray fluorescence com-puted microtomography (f gives users a noninvasive, spatially resolved, and multielemen-tal analysis technique that images the metal concentration of specific cell layers and organelles in plants as close to their natural state as possible.In Vivo Imaging of Cellular Chemistry Following the tradition of NSLS , NSLS-II will provide the broadest spectrum of synchrotron light available to scientists in the United States. The low-energy, nonionizing infrared beams are ideally suited for in vivo imaging without the complications of radiation damage. Even with intense x-rays, techniques like x-ray footprinting will take advantage of the radiolytic cleavage of water to probe structural and functional biology in living cells. Real-Time Chemical Imaging of Biomass Conversion In addition to understanding the structural and functional genomics of cellulolytic bacteria, elucidating how these processes occur in real time on real-world substrates such as lignocellulose also is necessary. New, noninvasive chemical imaging methods are needed to address spatially heteroge-neous environments. Synchrotron-based Fourier transform infrared ( FT-IR ) imaging provides a unique opportunity to image chemical changes in a heterogeneous system at high (micron) spatial resolution as a function of time. For example, the cell-wall architecture of Zinnia elegans was examined following acidified chlorite treatment and exhibited a breakdown of lignin and loss of polysaccharides (Lacayo et al. 2010). T o date, real-time synchrotron-based FT-IR imaging has been performed only with single-pixel infrared detectors, which generate images in a raster-scan fashion, (i.e., one pixel at a time). This approach is exceedingly slow, limiting the time resolution of the experiments to a time scale of hours. However with NSLS-II , infrared light from multiple dipole sources will be used to illuminate a 128 by 128 pixel array detector, enabling millisecond (or better) time resolu-tion. In addition, pixel oversampling can be employed to improve the spatial resolution by a factor of ten (i.e., to < 1 \u00b5m ). Lastly, the stability of the electron beam at NSLS-II will provide a 100-fold improvement in data signal-to-noise, a capability also necessary to achieve fast time resolution. Structural Dynamics in Living Cells Despite the value of in vitro experiments, questions often remain as to whether observations from them truly rep - resent events occurring within living organisms. In vivo observation of biomolecular structure, dynamics, and intermolecular interactions is thus a daunting but extremely desirable goal for understanding the natural function of biological molecules. Synchrotron x-ray footprinting is a promising technique for studying structural dynamics in liv - ing cells because it rapidly generates hydroxyl radicals with short pulses of intense x-rays. As proof of principle, x-ray footprinting was used to probe the structure of ribosomal RNA in frozen E. coli cells (Adilakshmi, Soper, and Woodson 79 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Appendix C: National Synchrotron Light Source-II Science Paper2009), providing tertiary structural information and allow - ing observation of protein- RNA contacts with nucleotide resolution in living cells. Living cell systems contain significant amounts of hydroxyl radical scavengers and thus require exposure times of hun-dreds of milliseconds with current technology. Such long exposure times may produce radiation-induced alterations that perturb the cellular machinery under investigation, resulting in poor data quality and limiting time resolution for observation of dynamics. Short exposure times are essential to drive this technology forward and allow in vivo x-ray footprinting of more complex systems and on physiologically relevant time scales. T o reach these shorter exposure times, the high flux density of an NSLS-II damping wiggler source will enable the use of transient and High-Throughput Technologies Becoming increasingly clear is that understanding the com- plexity of biological systems requires multimodal exploration. Thus, the next generation of scientific user facilities will need to provide integrated approaches that accommodate a wide variety of complementary techniques. NSLS-II will meet this important need by offering a wide range of capabilities that will enable multitechnique integration and cross-disciplinary approaches to doing science at the facility. Specifically, NSLS-II is planning on achieving this mode of research through a \"biology village\" environment. This village will strategically locate beamlines for scientific interaction and take advan-tage of programmatic synergies through shared equipment, tech no logy, and human resources. As a jump-start to this concept, researchers are using complementary techniques from different NSLS beamlines to study the same sample, enabling them to approach a scientific problem from several angles. Examples of technologies used in this integrative approach follow. MX and SAXS to understand the structure and function of a zinc peptidase (Aleshin et al. 2009). SAXS and x-ray footprinting to study the structure and folding of the tetrahymena ribozyme (Woodson 2010). MX and XAS to demonstrate the photoreduction of ferric myoglobin nitrate (Yi et al. 2010). STXM and FT-IR spectromicroscopy to study the organic composition and distribution of interplanetary dust par-ticles (Sandford et al. 2006). FT-IR and XFM to examine bacterial reduction of chro- mium (Holman et al. 1999). XFM and XRD to elucidate the distribution and speciation of iron in the rhizosphere of Alyssum murale (T appero et al. 2007). In addition to a multitechnique approach for characterizing complex biological systems, NSLS-II also will make avail- able high-throughput technologies for rapidly correlat-ing genomics with structural and functional information. The tremendous amount of genetic information obtained through DOE 's Genomic Science program understandably has generated a huge number of variants to be screened and characterized. Without advanced photon sources, detectors, computers, robotics, and routines for data collection and analysis, a high-throughput approach would not be possible. T oday, high-throughput technologies are becoming widely used in MX ( Joachimiak 2009), SAXS (Hura et al. 2009), and XAS (Shi et al. 2005). At NSLS-II , these approaches also are expected to be extended to the imaging beamlines, where the high brightness of the source will permit\u2014for the first time\u2014rapid tomographic (3D) imaging at the nanoscale.

Recently, a remarkable new tool, the world's first hard x-ray laser, began operation. This resource\u2014the Linac Coherent Light Source ( LCLS ) at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory\u2014has exceeded performance expectations and opened the door to the x-ray laser era. Early experiments from LCLS are illustrating the promise of x-ray lasers and establishing a strong user com-munity for them; yet a next-generation x-ray laser already is clearly needed to realize the full potential of this new tool. Based on a modern superconducting linear accelera - tor and leveraging the latest laser-seeding technologies, a next-generation source will provide the high repetition rate and high average coherent power needed to go beyond the initial stage of x-ray lasers. These capabilities will enable scientists to answer fundamental questions in a wide range of disciplines. The current design concept for NGLS is a coherent, x-ray free-electron laser ( FEL) array powered by a superconducting accelerator capable of delivering electron bunches to a suite of up to 10 independently configured FEL beamlines. Each beamline, operating simultaneously at a nominal repetition rate of 100 KHz, will be optimized for specific science needs. With multiple beam capabilities in each FEL beamline, up to 20 primary x-ray experimental end stations can operate in parallel, serving up to some 2,000 users per year. Figure D1, p. 82 , shows the major components of NGLS : the injector, laser heater, continuous-wave superconducting linac sections, linearizer and bunch compression systems, beam distribution, array of independent FELs, and x-ray beamlines. The NGLS approach combines significant recent advances in high-brightness photocathode beam generation, acceleration, and transport with state-of-the-art superconducting radio frequency ( RF) technology, as well as revolutionary concepts for laser-seeded FEL operation and undulator designs. The uniform pulse spacing at a high repetition rate will provide unprecedented capabilities at startup, accommodating more diverse and challenging experiments than those enabled by current or planned sources. This feature also offers the poten-tial to exploit conceptual and technical advances in areas such as seed lasers, superconducting undulators, x-ray optics, and FEL oscillators. The distributed multibeam approach enables enhanced capacity by expanding the number of end stations. There also is tremendous opportunity to exploit advances in machine control and operation to provide greater flexibility and new capabilities for generating x-ray pulses tailored to specific science needs. __________ *Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory prepared this and a companion document (p. 89) and approved post-workshop revi - sions to each.Introduction: Need for the Next Generation Light Source As a transformative tool for science, the Next Generation Light Source ( NGLS ) at Lawrence Berkeley N ational Laboratory ( LBNL ) will comprise an array of x-ray lasers providing temporally and spatially coherent pulses with unprecedented average brightness extending beyond 1 kiloelectron volt (ke V). Individual lasers and beamlines will be optimized for specific applications requiring, for example, high repetition rates, time resolution to the attosecond regime, high spectral resolution, tunability, and polarization control. This powerful combination of capabilities will enable cinematic imaging of dynamics, determination of the structure of heterogeneous systems, and development of novel nonlinear x -r ay spectroscopies. These unique resources will lead to a new understanding of how electronic and nuclear motions in molecules and solids are coupled and how functional systems perform and evolve in situ. NGLS will dramatically impact a wide range of energy applica - tions\u2014from natural and artificial photosynthesis to catalysts, batteries, superconductors, carbon sequestration, and biofuels. Solving the complex long-term energy challenges facing both the nation and world is the subject of a wide-ranging set of reports from the DOE Office of Basic Energy Sciences ( science. energy.gov/bes/news-and-resources/reports/). These reports highlight the urgent need for deeper understanding of the basic science underpinning energy technologies. NGLS \u2014with its combination of high average power, ultrashort pulses, and coherence\u2014is a revolutionary observational tool that will bridge the critical gaps in our understanding. T oday is a golden age for light sources. Storage ring-based synchrotrons routinely provide x-ray beams exploited by thousands of scientists annually to answer fundamental questions in diverse fields including human health, energy, and electronics and information processing. Synchrotron x-ray light sources have enabled scientists to (1) unravel the structures of biological macromolecules, essential for the design of new drugs; (2) reveal the properties of electronic materials for devices underlying the information technol - ogy revolution; and (3) provide the first glimpse of how energy conversion systems work at the atomic level. While these advances have been dramatic, there is much more to learn, and the array of x-ray lasers at NGLS will provide a foundation for major scientific advances in the 21st century. NGLS FacilityFig. D1. Schematic layout of the main components of NGLS (not to scale). [Courtesy of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory] 82 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental ResearchAppendix D: Next Generation Light Source Facility PaperNo other technology can provide the average power, precision, and simultaneous utilization of multiple beams by many researchers. First-generation x-ray FELs with low repetition rates provide orders-of-magnitude improve-ment over existing sources, primarily in peak brightness and temporal resolution. However, peak brightness is not a substitute for average brightness, particularly when probing valence electron structure, chemical bonding, electron cor - relation, and charge dynamics in condensed matter systems. A next-generation light source is needed that provides (1) high average brightness along with ultrafast temporal resolution down to the attosecond regime; (2) polarization control; and (3) tunability through the important absorption edges of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and the L -edges of first-row transition me tals (i.e., beyond 1 ke V in the first harmonic). High repetition rates are essential for capturing events that are rare or have low scattering rates and for probing the structures of heterogeneous ensembles in situ. Such rates also are needed to maintain the required average brightness for experiments in which the peak brightness is necessarily restricted to avoid significant perturbation of the sample. These scientific requirements can be uniquely met by an array of x-ray lasers with high repetition rates, as envisioned for NGLS . As a unique tool for exploring the structure and dynamics of matter at fundamental scales of length, time, momentum, and energy, NGLS will provide many benefits and advantages over existing and planned light sources. The facility ultimately will feature the following capabilities: H igh pulse repetition rates (100 k Hz or higher at each experimental end station and, ultimately, 100 MH z at specific end stations, approaching storage ring rates). V ery high average flux and brightness [several orders of magnitude greater than third-generation rings and first-generation FELs, with peak powers of gigawatts and aver - age powers of up to about 100 watts ( W) per beamline]. P ulse durations ranging from hundreds of attoseconds to hundreds of femtoseconds (fs). H igh temporal coherence of FEL output pulses (close to the Fourier transform limit). H igh transverse coherence (approaching diffraction limits). C ontrol of time duration, bandwidth, and other longitu- dinal features of the pulses (i.e., the possibility of enve-lope shaping, modulation, or structuring and, ultimately, feedback-based control of these parameters). E xcellent spectral resolving power without the need for monochromators. S ynchronization of the FEL pulses to a seed laser or to other infrared ( IR) or THz sources (with jitter or timing errors on the order of 1 to 10 fs). FEL output wavelengths (including harmonics) ultimately extending over more than two orders of magnitude, from ~10 nm P recision pump-probe experiments with combined probes in the soft x-ray or extreme ultraviolet ( EUV ) range and pumps in the UV, optical, IR, THz, or other bands. R apid polarization control. M ultiple independent beamlines supporting a large user community. The following sections describe NGLS baseline parameters for one preliminary design point while acknowledging the significant flexibility around these point parameters. No other existing or proposed facility can deliver the NGLS combina - tion of ultrafast capability, high longitudinal coherence, high average power, multiuser operability, and flexibility in time structure (both repetition rate and pulse duration). Moreover, the facility's upgrade potential could provide both additional capacity (up to seven more FELs) and new capabilities\u2014 including (1) higher repetition rates and resolving power; (2) higher average and peak x-ray power; (3) longer pulses; (4) shorter- and longer-wavelength FELs; (5) additional synchronization and shaping possibilities; and (6) x-ray pulse 83 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Appendix D: Next Generation Light Source Facility Paperfeedback control. The design options discussed in this Facility Paper are meant to illustrate the exciting scientific oppor - tunities presented by the convergence of rapidly advancing FEL technology; superconducting accelerator technology; and sophisticated micromanipulation of high-energy, high-brightness electron beams. A detailed optimization of cost, performance, and risk has yet to be performed but will build on the baseline preconceptual design outlined here. Capabilities of Present Facilities Briefly compared here are the capabilities of x-ray research tools that use ring-based sources, FELs, and high harmonic generation ( HHG ) Ring-based storage rings and energy recovery linacs ( ERL s)\u2014provide modest average power with low peak power. They support tunable devices that provide photon pulses at very high repe - t ition rates and may be considered continuous wave ( CW) sources for many applications. Storage ring-based sources are a proven technology, have well-established user communities, and will remain essential to a broad range of x-ray science. ERL s are an emerging technology not yet operating in the x-ray range. FELs can provide very high peak power as well as high average power and now operate in the x-ray range at lower repetition rates. As rapidly developing new capabilities, HHG sources provide modest average power in almost tabletop-sized sources but are not yet available in the x-ray range. Existing storage ring-based, spontaneous x-ray sources produce a maximum degeneracy parameter (or photon number emitted per \"coherence volume\") -2 photons in a six-dimensional (6D ) phase-space set by the Heisenberg-Fourier uncertainty principle. This degeneracy parameter is a fundamental description of what often is called brightness and reflects how far the pulse is from the ultimate Fourier transform and diffraction limits. Com-pared to third-generation synchrotron sources, future ERL s may produce more photons inside a smaller total phase-space volume and may achieve degeneracies on the order of 10 2 or 103. FEL sources, through the coherent amplification process, produce highly degenerate x-ray pulses, with 1010 or more photons per coherence volume. Seeded FEL s further increase degeneracy by orders of magnitude. Compared to storage rings, FEL sources provide increased peak flux (up to six orders of magnitude greater) and bright- ness or degeneracy (up to 10 orders of magnitude greater) because of the FEL amplification process. An additional advantage of FELs over ring-based sources is that electron pulses are prepared by a linear accelerator (linac) and then used only once to create x-rays. This enables precise control and tailoring of each individual x-ray pulse for particular scientific requirements. For example, 10 fs pulses with a large number of x-ray photons can be achieved only with FEL sources. The NGLS FEL complex will surpass the capabilities of existing x-ray facilities in numerous ways: I ncreased average photon flux and multiple, simultaneously operable x-ray beamlines will be provided. A mode rately high peak flux will help avoid undesired damage to or perturbation of sensitive samples, thereby maximizing the fraction of useful photons in each pulse in many experiments. The c ombination of very high repetition rates with high photon flux in short pulses will open up entirely new areas of science. The m ultiple x-ray beamlines will provide flexibility to serve many different types of experiments with x-ray probes of tailored pulse structures. The pot ential for precise synchronization will allow for multidimensional spectroscopy and pump-probe experi-ments with multicolor probes in the x-ray range and pump pulses in the THz, IR, visible, UV, or x-ray range. U se of FEL seeding schemes will enable excellent tunabil- ity and, ultimately, feedback-based control of x-ray pulse stability and characteristics. Normal-conducting, linac-driven FELs under realistic operat- ing conditions are quite limited in repetition rate, resulting in an average coherent x-ray power comparable to storage rings. In comparison, the high repetition rate of NGLS will provide an average coherent power three orders of magnitude higher than storage rings and normal-conducting linac facilities of comparable beam energy and six orders of magnitude greater than HHG sources. The European XFEL (x-ray free-electron laser) will be based on cryogenic superconducting accelera-tor technology. This technology will provide average x-ray power similar to NGLS but by operating in a burst mode with 3,000 microbunches spaced by 200 ns and repeating at 10 Hz. Figure D2, p. 84 shows a comparison of the time structure of ring-based sources, HHG lasers, and FELs. A comparison of NGLS parameters with those of other existing and planned FEL facilities is shown in T able D1, p. 85 . HHG sources currently provide nanojoule (nJ) pulses up to about 100 e V, with 10 k Hz repetition rate pulses. Future HHG sources are expected to improve in repetition rate and energy per pulse and reach soft x-ray wavelengths. NGLS capabilities for providing high average power and ultrafast pulses also will develop. These improvements will arise both as seed laser technology advances (potentially including the use of HHG for seeding) and as operation of emission ( SASE ) is implemented\u2014with a bunch charge of a few picocoulombs (p C), potentially at 100 MH z in a dedi - cated operating configuration. In this mode of operation, the short electron bunches radiate in a single or few optical modes, producing intense coherent radiation of a few fem-toseconds duration and at an extremely high repetition rate limited by the total electron beam power (installed ~2 MW capability). Producing ~108 photons per pulse at 1 ke V, an NGLS Facility84 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental ResearchAppendix D: Next Generation Light Source Facility Paperaverage power of ~2 W will be produced (three orders of magnitude greater than that projected for HHG sources). Machine Overview and Performance NGLS will operate in a novel parameter regime, providing a suite of unique features compared with existing or planned x-ray light sources. Most notable among these capabilities are a high-repetition-rate (1 MH z), high-brightness electron source and a superconducting radio frequency ( SCRF ) elec- tron linac operating in CW mode that will provide bunches at high average beam power with uniform bunch spacing. These bunches will be distributed via a spreader system to an array of independently configurable FELs. Each FEL will operate at pulse repetition rates three or more orders of magnitude higher than existing x-ray FELs and feature adjustable photon pulse power, central wavelength, polarization, and ultrafast temporal resolution down to the attosecond regime. The NGLS facility (see Fig. D1, p. 82 , for major components) is designed to meet the most critical of anticipated science needs and provide a large user capacity. At the same time, the design takes into account the physics and engineering constraints of the accelerator and FELs as well as facility and operating costs. The baseline design for a set of three simulta- neously operable x-ray beamlines will serve a large number of experiments per year, with the capability of providing up to ~100 W of average power to each of six end stations (two per FEL). Tunability will span the important absorption edges of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and the L-edges of first-row transi-tion metals (i.e., to 1.2 ke V in the fundamental and ultimately to 10 ke V in the third harmonic). First-generation x-ray FELs with low repetition rates provide orders-of-magnitude improvement over third-generation synchrotron sources, primarily in peak power and temporal resolution. However, peak power is not a substitute for the level of average power or coherent power that will be provided by NGLS . The primary spectral range of the NGLS baseline design will extend from 280 e V to 1.2 ke V at the fundamental of the undulator emission (using undulators with different periods) and up to ~3 ke V at reduced intensity with the generation of harmonics. Flux may be controlled from ~108 to ~1012 photons per pulse in the fundamental, depending on the desired wavelength, pulse duration, and repetition rate. Laser seeding will be implemented to produce pulses with duration as short as 250 attoseconds, with (1) temporal coherence Fig. D2. Comparison of x-ray pulse structure of different light source types based on current capability or near- term capability of facilities under construction. Storage ring and FEL performance is for soft x-rays (around 1 nm). ERLs and HHG sources currently are not operating at soft x-ray wavelengths, and thus performance is shown for UV and EUV wavelengths. Pulse energy is in the central cone of undulator radiation, and NGLS values reflect the baseline design self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) FEL repetition rate. (The seeded FELs operate at up to 100 kHz and may produce similar pulse energy in some operating modes; NGLS may operate in SASE mode at an even higher repeti-tion rate with reduced per-pulse energy.)

One of the two seeded FELs will be capable of producing \"two-color\" x-ray pulses; the other will provide better energy resolution with longer pulses and high temporal coherence. The third FEL will be a nonseeded SASE device capable of operating at the full repetition rate of the linac, thereby providing very high average power x-ray beams. At about constant average electron beam power, NGLS can operate at a higher pulse repetition rate using bunches of lower charge and shorter duration but higher brightness. These bunches might enable lasing at shorter wavelengths or possibly the operation of a SASE beamline in so-called \"single-spike\" configuration, with each short electron pulse naturally radiating into, at most, a very few longitudinal modes. T able D2, p. 86 summarizes major FEL performance parameters for the baseline machine, assuming a point design of 300 p C bunch charge (potentially varying from a few picocoulombs to 1 n C). The nominal number of photons per pulse produced in each of the three baseline FELs (as a func- tion of wavelength tuning) is shown Fig. D3, p. 86 .Bunches with the required high brightness will be generated at the desired high repetition rate by a state-of-the-art \"very electron photogun, also emittance compensation and compression by ballistic and velocity bunching through the injector. Further compres-sion will occur through a magnetic chicane in the linac before acceleration to the final beam energy. The machine is designed for an average current capability up to 1 m A, which is beyond the initial parameters of 300 p C and 1 MH z but consistent with a wide range of bunch charge and time structures. Beam brightness can be increased at lower bunch charge, and the gun and linac can accommodate a wide variety of beam conditions\u2014including operation with low-charge, high-brightness, and ultrashort bunches for SASE - based, ultrafast x-ray production. The baseline design has been developed assuming a lower bunch charge of 300 p C but allows flexibility to increase versatility in performance. Higher-charge operation is anticipated for longer pulse durations or for higher peak current to improve efficiency of photon production. Further studies will be required to delimit the exact boundaries of the beam parameter space accessible by NGLS . Table D1.

A more thorough analy - sis will be performed to select the optimal beam energy for NGLS based on performance, costs, and systems optimization. Beamlines using different undulator parameters and technologies could achieve different performance or cost goals. For example, the same type of undulator with a 26 mm period and 4 mm gap will cover wavelengths from 13.4 nm (93 e V) to 1.8 nm (688 e V). An advanced planar polarized light emitted ( APPLE ) type of undulator with a period of 38 mm and magnetic gap of 5.5 mm (providing a beam clearance of 4 mm) will cover wavelengths from 12.5 nm (99 e V) to 2.6 nm (476 e V) and with arbitrary polarization. Very short period, supercon-ducting undulators will allow even more options. Choices for beam energy and pulse repetition rates necessitate adopting SCRF technology for the linac. Designs for the cryomodule and RF systems are based on the 1.3 GHz tera electron volt energy superconduct - in g linear TESLA ) type of multicell cavities. The NGLS designers' choice of an accelerating gradient of approximately 14 MV/m is conservative in terms of present-day cavity capabilities; however, it is within a broad optimum of accelerating gradients when full construction and operating costs are considered.

[Courtesy of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory] 87 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Appendix D: Next Generation Light Source Facility PaperFurther studies will determine an optimal set of operating parameters for NGLS performance, balancing risk among the injector, linac, and FEL. Besides offering the desired high pulse repetition rates, CW operation of the SCRF linac has another significant benefit: it allows for automated high-frequency feedback control to ensure quality and uniformity of the elec - tron bunches. Consequently, jitter in x-ray pulse parameters is perhaps 10 times smaller than currently achieved. Design Optimization and Future Upgrades The NGLS design concept embraces a strategy of phased implementation of FEL beamlines and is configured to take advantage of future advances in high-brightness beams, new concepts in FEL operation, and improvements in undulators and x-ray optics. The electron beam spreader is intrinsically modular. Capacity can be increased by adding additional spreader elements, FELs, and x-ray beamlines together with the corresponding housing, as shown in Fig. D4, this page . Capability can be increased not only by adding advanced FELs, but also by increasing the electron beam energy with a combination of extra linac sections and gradient increases. For example, increasing beam energy to ~2.5 GeV and using undulators of ~12 mm period will produce more than 3 ke V in the fundamental and 10 ke V in the third harmonic at power levels estimated to be 1% of those achievable in the fundamental. Future performance estimates are reflected in T able D1, p. 85 . Similarly, an increase in beam energy to ~4 GeV\u2014together with developments in undulator technol- ogy that provide for 10 mm period devices\u2014would permit lasing in the fundamental at 10 ke V. In addition, modest improvements in cavity-quality factors could translate into significantly higher beam energies at fixed operating costs. Novel undulator designs\u2014including very-short-gap super-conducting undulators or possibly even electromagnetic undulators\u2014could dramatically expand the NGLS wave - length with only small increments in beam energy. Many of these areas of impact are, or will be, the subject of significant research efforts worldwide, and the NGLS project will be poised to take advantage of any incremental or revolutionary improvements.Layout, Conventional Facilities, and Utilities The initial NGLS machine will consist primarily of a straight section (for electron acceleration and transport) of ~450 m, which then will fan out over 180 m into multiple beamlines and end stations, as shown in Fig. D5, p. 88 . The major civil construction components are the linac vault and klystron gallery, spreader hall, FEL vault, and experimental hall. An exceptionally stable foundation will be needed to support the entire NGLS machine. Long-term settlement and vibration must be minimized for efficient machine operation and optimum performance. Additional space will be required for the cryogenics plant, including associated gas storage, a test facility for cryomodule acceptance, and machine maintenance activities. Space also will be needed for conventional facilities like cooling towers, low-conductivity and chilled water sys - tems, and electrical switching and transformer stations. Roughly 10 m of combined concrete and earth shielding will enclose NGLS . Beam dumps, located at the ends of both the spreader and each FEL, will be positioned below floor level and inclined downward. Concrete vaults surrounding the beam dumps will further isolate these units from the main portion of the machine and soil in which they are buried. The width and height of the injector and linac enclosure will be sufficient to house beamline components and support equipment and utilities while maintaining a walkway for installation and removal of a full cryomodule. The shield - ing enclosure in the spreader region will have an increased width necessitated by the shallow initial angle between the branch lines and main beam axis. This wide hall will transi - tion to individual branch enclosures for the FELs down- stream of the final bend magnet on each branch. The FEL vaults extend an additional ~120 m to the shielding end-wall and the beginning of the experimental hall. Spacing between FEL s will be about 6 m, adequate for two or more photon branch lines. X-ray beamlines will extend about 50 m from the first optic, housed within the shield wall, and will reach end stations near the far wall of the experimental hall. A walkway of ~10 m at the end of the photon beamline will provide access for the installation NGLS Facility Fig. D4.

Such dynamics are central to the function of biologi - cal systems and macromolecular machines\u2014including enzymes involved in DNA repair and replication; ribosomes responsible for protein synthesis; dynamic membrane pro - tein channels and signaling complexes; and organelles and the hierarchical structures of the cell, the fundamental unit of life. An enhanced understanding of the role of dynamics in biological function has both fundamental and practical importance, ranging from understanding how cells work to designing better therapeutics. Modern synchrotrons with scattering and diffraction tech- niques have revolutionized the field of structural biology by enabling the routine structure determination of isolated or simple complexes of macromolecules. The Next Generation Light Source ( NGLS) will enable entirely new methods for imaging biomolecules in native environments (i.e., in solu-tion rather than crystal form) and capturing their dynamics during functional cycles. Of paramount importance to achieving these advances will be the ability of NGLS to deliver ultrafast x-ray pulses at a high repetition rate. This, in combination with newly developed sample delivery systems and x-ray detectors, will allow researchers to collect billions of images of single molecules. From these images, probing thousands of conformational states accessible to biomol - ecules in solution will be possible. The combination of high repetition rate and high pulse power will make NGLS a natural resource for a number of imaging and spectroscopic techniques, including the \"dif - fract and destroy\" nanocrystallographic method currently under development at free-electron lasers worldwide. The following sections describe the complementary techniques of fluctuation x-ray scattering ( f XS), billion-snapshot coherent diffractive imaging, and associated advanced computational methods of manifold mapping that will be realized for the first time using the high-repetition-rate x -r ay lasers at NGLS . Fluctuation SAXS - Molecular Structures in Native Environments Understanding biological processes at a cellular level requires detailed knowledge of the structure and dynamics of large macromolecular machines. Currently lacking are the tools nec - essary for dynamic imaging of such biological machines\u2014in operation, in native environments, and at the nanoscale. Small- and wide-angle x-ray scattering ( SAXS and WAXS ) techniques (Andersson et al. 2009) offer tremendous potential and are being used to great advantage in combination with crystal - lography (Putnam et al. 2007). However, the full potential of these scattering techniques remains unrealized because the required exposure times at existing x-ray sources are orders of magnitude longer than the rotational diffusion times of the sample particles. Thus, the scattering data are spherically aver - aged, effectively projecting the three dimensions of the struc - ture onto one dimension. The restricted information available from these one-dimensional (1D ) projections is insufficient for unambiguous structure determination. NGLS x-ray lasers will provide the first capability for high- quality SAXS and WAXS with exposure times much faster than rotational diffusion time scales, thereby eliminating the spherical averaging limitation. For example, the rotational diffusion time for an ~300 nm by 20 nm test sample of tobacco mosaic virus ( TMV ) in pure room-temperature water will be <140 ns; for smaller macromolecules, the time will be from picoseconds to nanoseconds. The high-speed SAXS and WAXS scattering snapshots will reveal a wealth of additional structural information. This information\u2014contained in fluctuations about the mean SAXS signal (i.e., modulations in the nominally radially symmetric SAXS signal)\u2014 cannot be o btained by conventional techniques. Unlike SAXS and WAXS , which project three dimensions onto one, the snap- shot \" WAXS \" patterns from NGLS will show 2D variation, projecting three dimensions onto two and thus providing much more information. This powerful approach, known as \"fluctuation x-ray scat - tering\" ( f XS), originally was proposed by Kam 30 years ago (Kam 1977; Kam, Koch, and Bordas 1981). T o date, this method has been considered intractable\u2014due not to the pulse speed per se, nor the difficulty of analysis, but because at least one scattered x-ray per particle per snapshot must be measured within a rotational diffusion time. A recent experimental test (Saldin et al. 2010a) using a fixed distribution of gold nanorods as a model 2D system at the Advanced Light Source ( ALS) has shown that ab initio reconstruction is possible without relying on any of the modeling assumptions normally required for analysis of SAXS data. However, the model experiment using TMV (still a highly favorable case) in water at room temperature is not yet feasible at existing storage rings. The capabilities of NGLS x-ray lasers will finally enable this powerful f XS Next Generation Light Source New Biological Research Enabled by NGLS Imaging Structure and Function in Heterogeneous Ensembles90 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Appendix D: Next Generation Light Source Science Paperapproach for determining 3D structures of macromolecules in their native environments. Theory. The resurgence of interest in Kam's correlation- averaging approach has not happened in a long-planned single-molecule diffraction ( SMD ) method (diffract and destroy) poses significant data analysis problems that have been under study. In this case, the idea to use cor - relation averaging was rediscovered independently by Saldin and coworkers (Saldin et al. 2007). Indeed, it may be that SMD data can be reconstructed only by correlation averaging (Shneerson, Ourmazd, and Saldin 2008). The reconstruction in f XS requires solving two phase problems: (1) getting from the experimentally determined autocorrelation function to the 3D single-particle diffraction pattern and (2) inverting the diffraction pattern to retrieve the 3D image (as in coherent diffraction imaging). However, in spite of this increase in research activity, the latest publications have offered no solu- tion of the full 3D reconstruction problem for a modern f XS experiment, even in simulations. Prior Experiments. Good progress has been made on the 2D analogue of f XS, in which identical particles lie in a plane differing only by rotation about an axis parallel to the x-ray beam. In an f XS experiment at ALS, 80 nm-long gold rods were dispersed on membranes, with the rod orientations being random about one axis only. About 100 diffraction patterns of different areas were recorded, and the autocorrelation around a single q ring was calculated for each pattern. The averaged autocorrelations \"converged\" toward the autocorrelation of one particle. This derivation of a one-particle pattern from a measurement of an ensemble of particles is the essence of correlation averaging (see Fig. D6, this page). The final step consisted of phasing these data to reconstruct a 2D image of one typical gold rod. This work represents the first successful ab initio experimental demonstration of the Kam f XS method, albeit in two dimensions (Saldin et al. 2010b; Saldin et al. 2011). Theory Developments. A full 2D theory was described and used successfully to reconstruct a set of simulated diffraction patterns of K -channel membrane protein molecules, again randomly oriented about one axis (Saldin et al. 2010a). Researchers used this same theory to reconstruct the set of patterns from the gold rod samples in the experiment cited above. A 3D theory, still using spatial correlation averaging, also was developed for the SMD experiment and used successfully to reconstruct the 3D image of a protein molecule (Saldin et al. 2009). Recent theoretical developments show that ab initio image reconstruction of 3D objects (randomly oriented) is possible from f XS data using algorithms developed for protein crystallography and coherent diffractive imaging. Further - more, current algorithms available for shape reconstruction from SAXS data can be extended to incorporate f XS data. Although the computational complexity of the problem is significant, modern computational approaches are expected to eliminate the most significant bottlenecks. T o determine the structure of intermediate states during the reaction cycle of macro mo lecular machines, the theory of f XS can be extended following the lines of Andersson et al. 2009 (see also Kam 1977). The latter work demonstrates that a time-resolved series of WAXS data from an evolving mixture of species (as observed in time-resolved measurements) can be decomposed into curves of individual species of (meta) stable intermediates. A similar technique can be applied to f XS data, enabling the investigation of time-resolved structural changes of large mac - romolecular machines in near-native environments. Source Requirements. Proposed parameters of NGLS x-ray lasers fit the following f XS requirements. U ltrafast x-ray pulse durations\u2014Scattering patterns must be measured with x-ray exposures that are faster than molecular rotational diffusion times (typically subpico-second under native conditions). Fig. D6. The calculated autocorrelation of a single cylinder is shown with (A) the q ring autocorrelation of a single snapshot of many 80 nm gold cylinders (dotted) and (B) the effect of averaging together 121 dif- ferent measured snapshots. The average over the snapshots converges toward the single-particle pattern. [From Saldin, D.

Proposed NGLS flux per pulse is comparable to an exposure time of roughly 1 s on state-of-the-art SAXS beam - lines, indicating that, with sufficient data, high-resolution 2D f XS patterns can be efficiently obtained. Scattering patterns from multiple exposures can be summed together (with appropriate processing of individual patterns). Co herence\u2014A fully coherent beam provides significant simplifications in data analysis of mixtures and does not impede analysis of samples with a single structural species. The optimal choice of energy for an f XS experiment will be determined by the nature of the problem investigated. Available photon energies at NGLS, ranging from hard x-rays (using harmonics) to the water window (wavelength ~2 nm), allow for imaging relatively small systems such as enzymes (using hard x-rays) or very large systems such as viruses and large macromolecular assemblies like polysomes. NGLS will enable studying samples in buffer at physiological conditions, without viscosity enhancers, and at room temperature with no need for cooling to slow particle diffusion. Sample Environment and Data Acquisition. By using a liquid-water mixing jet (DePonte et al. 2008) running single file across the NGLS beam\u2014combined with suitable substrates, protein concentrations, jet velocity, and delay lines\u2014 f XS data can be obtained at intermediate time points spanning subnanoseconds to seconds within the duty cycle of a macromolecular machine. The high repetition rate of NGLS will allow collection of hundreds of thousands of pat - terns at suitably chosen time points along the continuous or droplet beam. NGLS will operate in the diffract and destroy mode to avoid any effects of radiation damage on the diffrac - tion patterns (Chapman 2009). Given data rates associated with these experiments, efficient detector technology is instrumental to the success of these studies. An exciting possibility is the development of hardware solutions for data reduction. Obtaining f XS data involves computing angular correlations of the scattering patterns. If this essential step can be performed on the detector with dedicated hardware while data are collected, a significant infrastructure bottle-neck is resolved. Outlook. The f XS technique overlaps with single- mo lecule diffraction studies that typically provide more detailed information than the ensemble-based f XS method. Due to the underlying experimental design of an f XS study, the tech- nique lends itself to a higher level of automation. Assuming a conservative, particle injector-limited data acquisition rate of 10 kHz, 10 million images can be obtained within 20 minutes, sufficient time to assemble a high- r esolution f XS dataset. Given its high-throughput nature (akin to industry-standard protein crystallographic data acquisition), automated f XS can be an essential tool in discovering novel drugs acting on membrane proteins or other large macromolecular machines not amenable to routine biophysical techniques used in structure-based drug design. Gigashot Imaging of Heterogeneous Ensembles with Manifold Mapping NGLS will produce ~1010 diffraction snapshots per day. Com- bined with advanced manifold-based analytical techniques, this capability will elucidate the role of heterogeneity in bio-logical systems; enable 4D imaging of molecular machines; and provide unprecedented, statistically validated access to the operation of molecular factories. Radiation damage severely limits the information that can be gathered from a single copy of soft-matter objects before they are destroyed. T o boost the weak scattered signal, cur - rent structural techniques average the data gathered from many objects assumed to be identical. Examples include well-established techniques such as crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo- EM; Frank 2006), as well as \"scatter destroy\" methods recently enabled by x-ray al. 2000; Gaffney and Chapman 2007; Fung et al. 2009). Mounting evidence, however, indicates that struc - tural variability not only is common at the molecular level, but also important to function and that \"structure\" in soft matter is neither static nor immutable (Ludtke et al. 2008; Fischer et al. 2010; Scheres et al. 2007; Brink et al. 2004; Yu et al. 2008; Levin et al. 2007). Although vital for controlling soft-matter processes, understanding structural variability and dynamics has remained elusive. The ability to collect and comprehend information from sys - tems spanning a broad heterogeneity landscape is essential to control complex dynamic processes for efficient energy conversion, carbon sequestration, and enzymatic reactions honed by nature over millennia. Accessing Dynamic, Heterogeneous Systems by Manifold Mapping Random snapshots obtained from members of a heteroge- neous ensemble are correlated, otherwise there would be nothing to characterize the set. In the absence of noise, these correlations force the snapshots to lie on a hypersurface\u2014a manifold\u2014whose dimensionality is determined by the number of degrees of freedom available to the system. A rotating rigid body observed in far-field diffraction, for example, has three (orientational) degrees of freedom and thus produces a 3D manifold (Fung et al. 2009). The additional degrees of freedom of a dynamic, nonrigid system give rise to higher dimensional manifolds (Schwander et al. 2010) as illustrated in Fig. D7, p. 92. Similarly, the reac - tion coordinates of an ongoing process are reflected in the dimensionality of the data manifold (Nadler et al. 2006). Fig. D7. Manifold traced out by simulated diffraction snapshots of an adenylate kinase molecule as it unfolds due to heating. Insets show the molecular structure at points on the manifold. Advanced analytical techniques offer a route to reconstructing the 3D structure of the molecule during its evolution, essentially generating a 3D movie of the unfolding process. [From Schwander, P ., et al. 2010. \"Mapping the Conformations of Biological Assemblies, \" New Journal of Physics 12, 035007. (Open-access article distributed under a Creative Commons license.) ] 92 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Appendix D: Next Generation Light Source Science PaperThe data manifold contains the entire information content of the dataset. Often, this manifold must be determined in the presence of overwhelming noise. Noise-robust algo - rithms for manifold mapping have been demonstrated with simulated and experimental data down to ~10 -\u00b2 scattered photons per pixel in the presence of background scattering, with signal-to-noise ratios as low as about -20 decibels (Fung et al. 2009; Schwander et al. 2010; Moths and Ourmazd 2009). Comprehending the information content of the dataset is tantamount to being able to \"navigate on the manifold\" to reach any desired point. For example, a researcher may wish to reconstruct the 3D structure of an enzyme at a particular point in its conformational landscape. A 3D model is equiv - alent to the ability to produce any 2D projection at will. On the data manifold, this involves navigating from a certain point (i.e., a given conformation) along directions of pure orientational change, thus producing any desired 2D projec - tion of the given conformation (see Fig. D7, this page ). Similarly, one goal may be to extract the conformational changes observed from a certain direction, equivalent to moving along the manifold in a direction of pure conforma - tion change.Manifolds swept out by random sightings of heterogeneous dynamic systems can be used to compile 4 D maps (i.e., \"3 D movies\") of these systems. Key to this approach is the availability of a sufficient number of snapshots to define the manifold to the required granularity. The unique characteristics of NGLS, particularly the combina-tion of high flux per pulse and high repetition rate, are essential to this capability. Conformational Heterogeneity and Dynamics: Molecular Machines Molecular machines undergo discrete and con- tinuous conformational excursions and induce similar changes in the substrate. Using ultralow-signal snapshots with no orientational or timing information, these changes can be mapped by manifold-based analytical techniques (Schwander et al. 2010; Giannakis et al. 2010). When a molecular machine possesses discrete conformational states, such as the closed and open conformations of the energy-relevant enzyme adenylate kinase, simulations show that snapshots are automatically and accu-rately sorted into two different manifolds. The error probability is 8.5 at 4 \u00d7 10 -\u00b2 scattered photons per Shannon pixel in the presence of Poisson noise (Levin et al. 2007) as shown in Fig. D8, p. 93 . The ability to separate discrete conformations with remarkable fidelity and determine the orientation from which each snapshot emanates is an indication of the efficient use that manifold-based approaches make of the information content of the entire dataset. The natural eigenfunctions of the scattering manifold allow identification of directions corresponding to orientational and conformational changes. In this frame-work, 4D maps (3D movies in time) can be compiled of continuous conformational changes in molecules and their assemblies. Such approaches currently are being used to map conformations of molecular machines using cryo- EM images (Fischer et al. 2010; Schwander et al. 2010) and x-ray FEL diffraction snapshots (Schwander et al. 2010). The fundamental limit to this approach is set by information- the oretic considerations. Roughly speaking, the experimental snapshots have been \"sorted\" into classes (i.e., \"bins\"), and the state of the system from which each class originated identified. The number of bits required for each class is determined by the size of the object, number of dis - tinguishable states accessible to the system, and resolution of the method of observation (Shneerson, Ourmazd, and Saldin 2008; Fung et al. 2009; Schwander et al. 2010; Moths and Ourmazd 2009). When the signal is so low that the information content of the dataset is smaller than the num-ber of bits required to label its classes, the process breaks down. At this very low limit (Elser 2009), total accumulated 93 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Appendix D: Next Generation Light Source Science PaperNGLS Sciencesnapshots can be traded against the dose per pulse (i.e., compensate for extremely low scattered signals by collecting more snapshots). The practical limit is set by the number of snapshots in the collection, which, in turn, depends on the source repetition or detector readout rates. As a specific example, recovering the structure of a rigid object to ~1 nm resolution typically requires ~10 4 snapshots (Fung et al. 2009). Distinguishing between 100 different conformations of a molecule with a sin-gle conformational degree of freedom increases the number of snapshots to ~10 6 (Schwander et al. 2010). By comparison, LCLS currently produces ~107 snapshots per day, limiting the size, complexity, and resolution at which the conformations, configurations, and dynamics of a system can be studied. NGLS will be capable of generating more than 10 10 snapshots per day. Systems with ~10 6 conformational states can be studied, assuming a one-day experiment and 10 4 snapshots are required to recover the 3D structure of each configuration to ~1 nm resolution. The largest number of conformational states mapped so far is ~50 (Fischer et al. 2010). The projected capabilities outlined above must be compared with those expected from alternative techniques when NGLS commences operation. Cryo- EM undoubtedly will continue to make progress in investigating molecular machines; datasets obtained with this method currently span ~10 6 snapshots. While further progress is possible in key steps such as sample preparation and microscope operation, increases of more than 100-fold in the size of cryo- EM datasets are difficult to envis - age. Such increases still would be 100 times smaller than capabilities offered by NGLS . More importantly, introducing time resolu-tion in cryo- EM has not been possible other than by slowing reactions chemically. The high repetition rate and time-resolved capabilities of NGLS represent an inherent advantage in studying dynamic systems on nano to atto scales. Gigashot digital cellular microscopy with NGLS offers an unprec-edented capability to reconstruct selected regions of a large number of objects with orientational, conformational, and configu-rational degrees of freedom. This capability provides a route to statistically validated examination of molecular factories beyond the limits set by radiation damage. Diffract and Destroy at High Repetition Rates An important consideration for diffractive imaging applications is that they will rely on fundamentally new implementations of the diffract and destroy method pioneered at FLASH (the Free-Electron Laser in Hamburg) and LCLS . Both f XS and billion-shot diffractive imaging deal with the problem of random sample orientation in new ways that capitalize on the capabilities of NGLS x-ray lasers. These techniques will exploit the tremendous advances in experimental capabili - ties that have been driven by first-generation x-ray FEL s. In particular, the Spence laboratory at Arizona State Univer - sity has developed a liquid \"aerojet\" injector for generating a 1 MH z stream of ~1 \u00b5m liquid droplets at velocities of ~10 m/s (see Fig. D9, p. 94). This tool has been successfully demonstrated in initial experiments at LCLS (using protein nanocrystals in solution). The temporal stability and uni - form pulse spacing derived from the NGLS superconducting linac operating in CW mode will be essential for synchroni - zation with future high-speed aerojet injectors. Potential Biological Targets Modern synchrotrons and macromolecular crystallographic methods have revolutionized the field of structural biol - ogy by enabling the routine structure determination of isolated or simple complexes of macromolecules. However, conventional structural determinations of biological macromolecules disregard the presence of heterogeneous conformations by assuming identical objects. Moreover, current x-ray methods for structural determination depend Fig. D8. Manifold mapping of conformational states in molecular machines. This mapping technique separates snapshots from different conformations and finds the orientations within each set with no a priori knowledge. A mixture of diffraction snapshots from the adenylate kinase molecule in its open and closed conformations is presented to noise-robust versions of graph-theoretic techniques at signal levels corresponding to 0.04 photons per pixel at 0.18 nm. The snapshots are automatically sorted into different manifolds and their orientations determined. The 8.5 separation between the two manifolds implies extreme fidelity in separat-ing different conformations.

Y et, biological function is known to be profoundly influenced by subtle (and not so subtle) changes in conformation that span many decades in time, from picoseconds to milliseconds. T o advance the understanding of biological processes at a cellular level, detailed knowledge of the structure of very large macromolecular machines is an absolute necessity. The high repetition rate of x-ray lasers at NGLS will enable entirely new methods for (1) imaging biomolecules in native environments (e.g., in solution rather than crystal form), (2) capturing the dynamics of molecules during their functional cycles, and (3) visualizing cellular components in their native context. The dream of \"imaging biological function\" will be realized for the first time. The following sections present a few representative examples of key areas of biology that will be transformed by NGLS capabilities for imaging heterogeneous ensembles and conformational dynamics of biomolecules in native environments. Nanogeobiology Recent advances in microbiology have demonstrated that microorganisms are intimately involved in the transformation of inorganic minerals at or near the Earth's surface (Weber, Achenbach, and Coates 2006). Microbe-catalyzed electron transfer ( ET) to metal ions in these minerals lies at the heart of many such transformations, which are performed by redox-active proteins that efficiently transport electrons over long distances with minimal loss of free energy (Fredrickson and Zachara 2008). These redox proteins are exquisitely tuned for facile ET to different solid-phase electron acceptors. A basic research goal in biogeochemistry is understanding the natural diversity and impact of microbial redox proteins and the processes by which microorganisms have been shap-ing Earth over geologic periods. Because microbe-mineral ET processes influence the carbon cycle and contaminant distribution and mobility, understanding them is crucial for safeguarding our natural environment. Multiheme c-type cytochromes expressed by iron (III)- reducing bacteria are among the best-characterized redox- active microbial proteins that interact with minerals and soluble metal ions (Shi et al. 2009). Physiological studies of these bacteria have identified a number of outer-membrane multi heme c-type cytochromes (e.g., MtrC) that interact with mineral surfaces. However, no high-resolution structure of MtrC or related proteins exists to rationalize the pathway of electron transfer. Consequently, detailed mechanisms of ET often are derived from model studies on simpler redox-active proteins that are easier to handle and for which crystallo - gr aphic structures can be obtained (Kerisit et al. 2007). Y et, such model systems cannot address structure-activity relationships in relevant systems. A major contribution to understanding these complex nanogeobiological systems will be new methods, enabled by NGLS x-ray lasers, for determin- ing the structure of environmentally and technologically important electron-transfer proteins, including multiheme c-type cytochromes such as OmcA. Dynamic pump-probe studies that visualize the structural changes occurring on the time scales of intraprotein and interfacial ET are essential. Experiments that can visualize the structural dy namics of the protein-inorganic material interface before and during intermolecular ET will vastly expand our understanding of this proc e ss. T o determine how ET kinetics and pathways are altered by association with a mineral surface, the sensitizer-protein bioconjugate could be complexed to a polyoxometa - late cluster, which can serve as a model for a metal oxide mineral (see Fig. D10, p. 95 ). These kinds of studies will provide the first-ever systematic understanding of the struc - ture and kinetics of interfacial ET. This fundamental science is envisioned to enable rational engineering of the redox pro - tein-crystal interface and, in turn, have significant applications in and biosensing. Carboxysomes Carboxysomes are self-assembling proteinaceous organelles that play a key role in bacterial carbon dioxide (CO) fixa - tion (see Fig. D11, p. 95 ). Ranging from ~90 to 170 nm in diameter and from 100 to 350 MDa in mass (Schmid et al. 2006; Iancu et al. 2007; Iancu et al. 2010), carboxysomes encapsulate hundreds of copies of two key enzymes involved in CO fixation: RuBisCO and carbonic anhydrase (see Fig. D11 c and d, p. 95 ; Iancu et al. 2007; Heinhorst, Cannon, and Shively 2006).

DOI: 10.1007/s11120-011-9624-6.]CO emissions and develop carbon sequestration technolo - gies, there is great interest in understanding carboxysomes and using them to enhance CO capture and fixation rates in bioengineering applications. Thus far, structural informa - tion about carboxysomes has been limited to structures of isolated component proteins or low-resolution electron microscopy images. The dynamic imaging capabilities of NGLS x-ray lasers present unprecedented opportunities to characterize whole functional carboxysomes; observe dynamic structural changes during catalysis; understand the cellular context in which carboxysomes assemble; and track changes in carboxysome structure in response to environ-mental changes. New time-resolved x-ray imaging techniques are required for a full understanding of the structure and catalytic dynamics of CO fixation by carboxysomes. For example, structural data at the nanometer-resolution limit for a single carboxysome will reveal how RuBisCO and carbonic anhydrase pack together inside a functional carboxysome to mediate substrate and product channeling. Docking atomic-level structures of RuBisCO, carbonic anhydrase, and shell proteins into a nanometer-resolution map of the whole carboxysome will provide a detailed view of how RuBisCO and carbonic anhydrase are arranged for CO fixation as well as how they interact with the protein shell. The internal structure of the carboxysome also is antici - pated to change with available light, the metabolic state of the cell, or the state of biogenesis. A powerful result of single-particle imaging thus will be the ability to compare reconstructions of carboxysomes from many cells or cells grown under different environmental conditions. This capability will enable the characterization of conserved and heterogeneous features of carboxysome structure and iden-tification of structural changes that occur in response to shifting environmental conditions. Nanometer-resolution carboxysome structures also will provide an initial founda - tion to understand how the structures of carboxysome proteins change during catalysis. Membrane Proteins Cells are surrounded by membranes that separate the cellular interior from the outside world. The lipids and proteins that dominate the composition of membranes exhibit a characteris - tic architecture in which the lipids adopt a bilayer arrangement (~40 \u00c5 thick) penetrated by integral membrane proteins. The flows of molecules, energy, and information across this bar - rier are mediated by these proteins embedded in the bilayer. Membrane proteins represent a fertile area for structural study; an estimated 25% of the proteins encoded in the genomes of organisms are membrane proteins, yet they constitute less than 96 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Appendix D: Next Generation Light Source Science Paper1% of current entries in the Protein Data Bank (Berman et al. 2002). The biological significance of membrane proteins mirrors their pharmacological significance because they are targets for a majority of the most popularly prescribed drugs (Davey 2004). The same properties that enable membrane proteins to function in this heterogeneous milieu also have profound consequences for their structural analysis. Reflecting the small ratio of membrane surface area to cellular volume, membrane proteins generally are present in low abundance, and extracting them from the membrane typically involves using detergents to solvate the hydrophobic surfaces. Consequently, the most detailed structural information on membrane proteins is typically in their detergent-extracted state (Poolman et al. 2005). While detergents have been extremely useful, they are not always faithful mimics of the membrane bilayer and can perturb the structure and dynamics of membrane proteins. T ransformative new methods will be enabled by NGLS x-ray lasers that provide information on the structure and dynamics of membrane proteins in a native-like bilayer environment, including proteoliposomes or supported bilayers. The characteristic properties of the ion-channel class of membrane proteins reflect their conductance, ion selectiv-ity, and gating. These proteins typically are regulated by conformational switching of their structures between \"open\" and \"closed\" states. This conformational switching may be gated in response to changes in membrane potential ( Jiang et al. 2003), ligand binding (Kawate et al. 2009), or applica-tion of mechanical forces (Liu, Gandhi, and Rees 2009). Structural studies have been able to visualize end points and, rarely, intermediate states in conformational switching (for example, see Fig. D12, this page). Voltage-gated channels (Doyle et al. 1998) represent one of the basic circuit elements of neurobiology, and their response to changes in membrane potential serves as a key event in the propagation of electrical signals through the nervous system. Over the past decade, the structural framework for addressing the opening and closing of voltage-gated channels has been developed (Doyle et al. 1998). However, the dynamics of these processes (the temporal response of structural changes) has been lacking. Also notable is that the influence of the membrane poten-tial on a protein requires a membrane, and these effects cannot be studied with detergent-extracted proteins in the absence of a membrane. Thus, time-resolved structural studies characterizing the membrane and the response of the voltage-gated channels embedded in the membrane to changes in membrane potential will be essential in estab - lishing the mechanistic details of this fundamental event in cell signaling. Questions to be answered include, \"How does a protein domain move through the membrane to cre-ate an all-or-none change in channel conductance without compromising membrane integrity?\" . Beamlines for Imaging Biological Dynamics and Function Biological imaging research will rely on diffract and destroy methods using the third and fifth harmonics with the highest flux per pulse on two NGLS beamlines: S eeded beamline 1 U nseeded SASE beamline 3 at MH z repetition rates (as high-speed detectors allow). Choice of wavelength will be determined by balancing the scattering efficiency with the required resolution for particu-lar samples. A key component of these experiments will be a high-speed particle injector synchronized to the continuous-wave, superconducting radio frequency linac, which will provide for sample replacement on a pulse-by-pulse basis.

Crystal - lography, small-angle scattering, diffraction, and reflectometry are ideal methods for studying structure and organization on length scales from atoms to microns, and neutron spec - troscopic methods characterize self- and collective motions on time scales from picoseconds to microseconds. These tech-niques are applicable to the length and time scales intrinsic to biological systems but, unlike most other methods, are uniquely sensitive to hydrogen (and its isotopes), an atom abundantly present throughout biological materials and a key effector in many biological processes. Oak Ridge National Laboratory ( ORNL ) hosts two of the world's most powerful and advanced neutron scattering research facilities, the Spallation Neutron Source ( SNS ) and the which attract ( SNS pro - duces the most intense pulsed neutron beams in the world. It is designed to be upgraded to 3 MW and ac c ommodate a second target station, doubling the number of experimental end stations. The 85 MW HFIR has one of the highest con- tinuous neutron fluxes of any research reactor, and its cold neutron source is the most intense in the world. With these two leading-edge facilities, ORNL is positioned for leadership in addressing a diverse set of scientific problems in biology whose solutions are essential to future progress in health, medicine, and energy. Introduction A variety of neutron scattering techniques can be used to char - acterize the structural and dynamical properties of biomaterials across length scales from microns (\u00b5m) angstroms and time (\u00b5s) to picoseconds (ps). Although the neutron's interaction with atomic nuclei is weak, the scatter in g \"power\" (cross-section) of an atom is not related to its atomic number, as is the case for x-rays. As a result, neigh - bor ing elements in the periodic table can have substantially different scattering cross-sections and correspondingly dif - fe rent contributions to a measured neutron signal. Moreover, the interaction of a neutron with an atomic nucleus differs for an element's various isotopes. The scattering cross-section of hydrogen, which is ubiquitous in biology, differs dramatically from that of its isotope deuterium. This difference, coupled with the ability to substitute deuterium for hydrogen, enables powerful contrast variation methods that allow subunits within intact, functional macromolecular complexes to be highlighted. Furthermore, neutron energies are similar to the biologically relevant energies of atomic translations, rota - tions, and vibrations, enabling spectroscopic studies of these dynamic processes as well as both self- and collective di ff usiv e motions. Neutron scattering has the ability to provide unique, novel insights into structural and dynamic transi t ions related to biologically important processes. SNS is the United States' newest and most advanced neu tr on scattering facility. It contains a broad suite of instru me nts, including small-angle neutron scattering research reactor, HFIR , has been substantially upgraded in recent years. Its cold neutron source provides the long-wavelength neutrons that enable two world-class SANS instruments, and HFIR soon will serve a crystallography station well suited to studying biological macromolecules. The neutron beams produced at SNS complement and expand on the suite of instruments available at HFIR , thus enabling new science with neutrons that could not have been realized a decade ago. In particular, the intense pulsed nature of the SNS neutron beams opens up op por tunities to collect structural and dynamical data on time scales previously unachievable at neutron scattering facili t ies (i.e., from subseconds to hours). The suite of neutron scat - tering instruments at SNS\u2014including those designed for and dedicated to interrogating biological samples\u2014will be used to address a wide variety of problems in structural biology. These challenges range from atomic-resolution analysis of enzyme structure and dynamics to meso- and macroscale analyses of complex biological structures, membranes, or assemblies and their kinetic processes. Neutrons' weak interaction with mat - ter makes them highly penetrating and nondestructive. This feature enables the use of complex sample environments that simulate biologically relevant conditions (e.g., pH, salin it y, and humidity), including those that often are poorly suited to other structural biology techniques (e.g., high pressures and extreme [Courtesy of Oak Ridge National Laboratory] 100 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Appendix E: Spallation Neutron Source Facility Papertemperatures). The Neutron Sciences Directorate at ORNL has a dedicated sample environment group that works with users and beamline scientists to develop and advance the state of the art in sample environments suitable for biological materials. Despite the clear benefits that neutrons offer for biology, their broader application in the biological sciences has been constrained by a number of factors. These include the limited flux of available neutron beams; the very limited (or nonexis - tent) availability of suitable neutron instruments and sample environments; and, to an extent, a lack of cohesive scientific direction in biological sciences at neutron facilities. New opportunities exist in supporting data reduction and analysis for members of the structural biology community, many of whom are not experts in neutron scattering. ORNL has invested in establishing a cohesive neutron structural biology program that expands upon the Center for Structural Molecular Biology, which is funded by DOE 's Office of Biological and Environ- mental Research ( BER ). This expansion includes the establish- ment of the Biology and Soft Matter Division, one of three specific multidis c iplinary scientific areas established to foster scientific programs and partnerships at SNS and HFIR . This Facility Paper describes the suite of current and future ORNL capabilities for structural biology using neutron scattering and imaging that enable world-leading science at SNS and HFIR . Research Protein Crystallography Macromolecular crystallography continues to be the lead - in g technique for atomic-resolution analysis of proteins and nucleic acids. Because of their unique sensitivity to hydrogen and its isotope deuterium, neutrons can be used to locate hydrogen atoms within biological macromole c ules. Locat - ing hydrogen atoms provides special insight into enzymatic processes that are difficult, if not impossible, to obtain via other structural biology tech nique s. By 2013, ORNL will provide access to a suite of three state-of-the-art single-crystal diffractom e ters ideal for macromolecular crystallogra p hy and designed and optimized for analyzing submillimeter-size single crystals. Currently at SNS, the first of these instruments, the TOPAZ single-crystal diffractometer, is completing com- missioning and will be available in 2012 for high-resolution chemi cal a nd biological crystallography on systems with unit cell edges < 1 00 \u00c5. A second instrument, MaNDi (macromo - lecular neutron diffractometer), will enter the user program in 2013 and be capable of collecting, at near-atomic resolution, the data from 0.1 mm 3 crystals with lattice repeats of ~150 \u00c5. MaNDi's large-area detector (see T able E1, p. 101 ), coupled with the high neu tr on flux at SNS, will enable collection of a complete dataset within a few days. Also suitable for structural biology is IMAG INE, a quasi-Laue image plate diffractometer under construction at HFIR and funded by the National Science Foundation ( NSF ). Instrument capabilities for macromolecu- lar crystallography are summarized in T able E1.Macromolecular Complexes, Flexible Systems, and Hierarchical Structures The intrinsic structures of disordered macromolecular com- plexes have long posed challenges for structural biology. These systems can be resistant to crystallization\u2014preclud in g high- resolution structural determination\u2014and typically are too large for study by nuclear magnetic resonance. Their flexibility, often important to their biological functions, also can prevent their crystallization by traditional methods. SANS is well suited for studying such systems because it can provide structural information under near-native biological conditions. Like all neutron scattering techniques, SANS is sensitive to the hydro - gen content of materials. The structures of subunits within a functional, intact complex can be probed by combining SANS with selective deuterium labeling of the subunits or by leverag - ing the intrinsic difference in the neutron scattering power of proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids. ORNL has three SANS instruments (see T able E2, p. 102 )\u2014the recently p leted instruments at HFIR , which both began operation in late 2007. EQ-SANS is designed to study noncrystalline nanomaterials such as polymers, micelles, proteins, and large biomolecular complexes in solu-tion. Its capabilities include high neutron flux, high wavelength resolution (precision), and wide Q coverage. The higher Q values accessible to EQ-SANS make it uniquely suited to probing shorter length scales, such as those impor t ant to crystallization during annealing and other significant processes in biological materials science. These instruments provide complementary capabilities (see T able E2) that position ORNL to address a diverse number of problems in structural biology. Biological Membranes and Macroscopic Systems The biological function of cell membranes is intrinsically linked to structure. Cell membranes are complex, dynamic, responsive, and self-repairing assemblies that are spatially and temporally heterogeneous and regulate transport, signaling, and energy processes in living systems. As complex systems composed of lipids, proteins, and other molecules (e.g., cholesterol), cell membranes have proven difficult to study. However, the study of membranes can be facilitated by taking advantage of the self-assembly tendencies of their cellular components to produce samples with well-defined geom-etries. One technique ideally suited to leveraging this inherent feature of membranes is neutron reflectometry. By adsorbing a membrane to a planar surface, interrogation of the mem-brane structure and its interactions with other biomolecules, such as proteins and cholesterol, is possible. The Liquids Reflectometer (see T able E3, p. 103 ), one of the first instru- ments commissioned at SNS , is well suited to studying lipid membranes in a planar geometry under biologically relevant conditions. The high flux available on the Liquids Reflectome-ter enables time-resolved studies of specific structure features 101 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Table E1. Instruments for Protein Crystallography Instrument Availability Instrument Data Applications TOPAZ (SNS) Available in 2012 Wavelength: 0.5 < < 7.2 \u00c5 : 0.2% Q range: 0.25 to 20 \u00c5 -\u00b9 angle: 20 to 160Detector resolution: 1 by 1 mm\u00b2 TOPAZ is optimized specifically for high-resolution chemical crystallography and can resolve unit cell edges of up to 50 \u00c5. It is therefore ideal for studying oligonucleotides and small pro - teins [< 25 to 30 kilodaltons (kDa)] at or near atomic resolution (1.0 to 1.5 \u00c5). However, TOPAZ can be configured to study larger proteins at lower resolution with cell edges up to 100 \u00c5.

At the other end of the length scale, the VENUS neutron imaging facility proposed at SNS (see T able E3, p. 103 ) will be capable of providing detailed structural information at resolutions from submillimeters down to 1 \u00b5m. The large field of view (up to 1 m by 1 m) will allow unprecedented studies of real biological systems. Using SNS 's pulsed neutrons, VENUS will be able to take real-time measurements (i.e., events of a few milliseconds) with strobo - scopic imaging techniques. Dynamical Measurements in Biological Systems The dynamics of atomic groups or molecules that make up materials contain key information indispensable for under - standing and controlling the properties of biological materi - als. Unlike other techniques for probing structural dynamics, neutron scattering is sensitive not only to the temporal, but also the spatial characteristics of dynamical processes through the scattering signal's dependence on neutron momentum transfer. The large incoherent neu tr on scattering cross-section of hydrogen, compared with that of other elements, allows researchers to use partial sample deuteration to probe the dynamics of selected structural units in biological systems inherently rich in hydrogen. Moreover, the highly penetrating nature of neutrons enables the use of sample environments not compatible with other experimen t al techniques, such as those providing very high pressures or magnetic and electric fields. The Backscattering Spectrometer ( BASIS ) at SNS features a unique combina t ion of high-energy resolution and a wide variety of accessible energy transfers that enables experiments over a broad range of biological motions, from nanosecond to picosecond time scales. The Cold Neutron Chopper Spectrometer ( CNCS ) is particularly well suited for investigating collective dynam ic s such as the fluctuations of biological membranes and the diffusive motions of small molecules like water and many drugs. The Neutron Spin Echo spectrometer ( NSE ) is capable of measuring lower energies (slower processes) and longer length scales, with the maximum achievable Fourier time extended to at least 1 s. 102 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Appendix E: Spallation Neutron Source Facility PaperUsing wavelengths of 0.25 < / nm < 2.0, an unprecedented dynamical range of six decades from 1 ps < to < 1 s can be achieved, greatly enhancing the range of biological systems that can be studied at SNS . (For details of these instruments, see T able E4, p. 104 ). Infrastructure and Support Although world-class neutron scattering instrumentation is critical for leading an effective neutron structural biol o gy program, the instruments must be supported by sample preparation and characterization facilities staffed by expert researchers. ORNL has established the Bio-Deuteration Laboratory to help biologists and biophysicists maximize the potential of their neutron scattering experiments. Addition - al ly, its data analysis and modeling effort will enable ORNL to take a leadership role in the use of modeling and simulation for interpreting neutron scattering data.The Bio-Deuteration Laboratory The particular sensitivity of neutrons to hydrogen and its iso - t opes makes selective deuteration in complex biological sys - t ems a necessary tool for maximizing the impact of neutron scattering experiments. For example, in SANS experiments, the use of a deuterium-labeled subunit in a complex allows researchers to deconvolute the scattering of the labeled and un l abeled subunits, along with their relative disposi- tions within the complex. Similar approaches are equally powerful in studying biological membranes with neutron reflectometry. The use of deuterated proteins also improves the sensitivity of crystallography experiments and makes working with smaller crystals possible. In inelastic neutron scattering experi me nts, specific deuterium labeling can be used to highlight dynamics of interest within a system. The mission of the Bio-Deuteration Laboratory is to sup - por t and develop the facilities and expertise required for Table E2.

In typical applications, microbial pro t ein expression systems (such as Escherichia coli) have been adapted to grow in heavy water (D O) and deuterated carbon sources, allowing functional, isotopically deuterium-labeled proteins to be expressed reliably and in large quanti-ties. More ad v anced techniques are being developed that will enable the design and production of specific, random, and uniformly hydrogen- or deuterium-labeled macromolecules for specific applications. Computational Modeling and Simulation In addition to being home to two world-class neutron scat - t ering facilities, ORNL hosts the National Center for Com - put ational Sciences. Its \"Jaguar\" Cray XT5 supercomputer is one of the world's most powerful machines for unclassified research and is the cornerstone of ORNL 's Leadership Com - put ing Facility ( LCF ). The combination of neutron scatter in g instruments at SNS and HFIR and the computing power offered by LCF enables ORNL to perform multiscale analysis of the structure and dynamics of biological systems. Jaguar and the NSF -funded Kraken supercomputer are petaflop-class computing systems capable of modeling biological systems over length and time scales not previously accessible. ORNL 's Neutron Sciences Directorate is establishing the Simulation and Modeling Division that will lead an effort to bridge ORNL 's supercomputing facilities with the neutron scatter in g research at SNS and HFIR . The members of this division will work with researchers studying biological systems using the various neutron scattering techniques. Also, ORNL 's Center for Molecular Biophysics uses computational techniques to investigate biological systems\u2014including enzymatic processes and the structural dynamics of biomass\u2014via simu-lations of up to one million atoms. The center actively col - laborates with researchers using neutron scattering to probe the dynamics of biological systems.Table E3.

Crystallog- raphy, small-angle sca tt e ring, diffraction, and reflectometry are ideal methods for studying atomic and subatomic struc-tures, and several types of neutron spectroscopy are used for characterizing material dynamics. Neutron scattering is applicable to the length and time scales intrinsic to biological systems. Unlike other structural techniques, it is uniquely sensitive to hydrogen (and its isotopes), an atom abundantly present in biological materials and a key effector in many biological processes. ORNL 's two neutron scattering research facilities, the Spallation Neutron Source ( SNS ) and 1 MW SNS produces the most intense pulsed neutron beams in the world. It is designed to be upgraded to 3 MW and accom mod ate a second target station. The 85 MW HFIR has one of the highest continuous neutron fluxes of any research reactor, and its cold neutron source is the most intense in the world. These two leading-edge facilities position ORNL for leadership in addressing a diverse set of scientific problems in structural biology whose solutions are essential to future progress in health, medicine, and energy. Introduction Structural biology has a prolific and proven track record of providing key molecular-level insights into life's essential processes. Through the application of several complemen - t ary physical techniques\u2014particularly x-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy\u2014the structures of many molecular components of biological sys - tems are being solved at near-atomic resolution. The increasing availability of genomic sequences along with advances in technologies that manipu l ate and translate genes into molecu- lar structures are presenting a clearer picture of the structural complexity of molecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids, within living organisms. These new capabilities in structural and molecular biology have enabled researchers to better understand the relationship between molecular structure and function, knowledge that in turn has provided insights into the role of that relationship in evolution and disease. These new insights have enabled the development of rational approaches to ge ne tic engineering and therapeutics. The next great chal - lenge in structural biology is to understand how these mol - ecules dynamically interact, change shape, and assemble with each other and how they carry out their detailed biochemical or physical functions at an atomic level. Structural biology must continue to evolve if it is to address the increasingly challenging problems that arise as scientists strive to under - stand the interplay of systems that drive living cells. These cel - lular systems need to be understood over length scales ranging from the atomic to the cellular and over time scales spanning atomic vibrations to macromolecular processes such as protein folding. Such knowledge is important for tackling disease and for industrial manipulation of cellular systems to introduce new pathways and functionalities through biology. The importance of neutron scattering for addressing chal - le nging problems in biology is that it provides unique structural and dynamic information on complex sys t ems. The structural information provided is di r ectly complementary to that provided by other experimental methods such as NMR spectroscopy; electron microscopy; and x-ray scattering tech- niques like diffraction, small-angle scattering, and reflectom - e try. The dynamic information provided is complementary to that provided by spectroscopic techniques. Neutrons can be used to probe length scales ranging from angstroms to microns and can elucidate dynamic processes occurring over time scales from picoseconds to milliseconds. They also are capable of investigating the kinetic behavior of systems over time scales from milliseconds to hours. This combination of both structural and dynamic data over enormous length and time scales cannot be achieved with any other single experimental technique. Neutrons thus allow researchers to probe cellular pro c esses that range from fast reactions at the atomic level (e.g., enzyme catalysis) to slower processes that involve complex molecular assemblies and machines (e.g., light harvesting, signaling, membrane translocation, and cell-wall synthesis). Several of their properties enable the use of neutrons to acquire information unobtainable by other structural biology methods. X-rays are scattered primarily by elec tr ons; neu- trons are fundamental particles scattered by their interaction with atomic nuclei. While the scattering \"ability\" of x-rays increases simply with atomic number, the scattering \"ability\" of neutrons varies in a complex man ne r that depends on the mass, spin, and energy level of the target nucleus. However, this scattering ability remains comparable for all atoms, mak-ing light atoms visible. Because neutrons interact uniquely with different nuclei, including various isotopes of elements, neutron scattering enables the powerful and commonly used method of contrast variation. Particularly important for biological samples, which are inherently rich in hydrogen, neutrons are very sensitive to the strong but different scatter-ing from hydrogen and its isotope deuterium. This difference allows for the classical example of contrast variation by the substitution of hydrogen with deuterium. The variation in scattering power between hydrogen and deuterium is one of the largest differences ex i sting among the isotopes of any SNS ScienceSpallation Neutron Source SNS: Addressing the Next Challenges in Biology106 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Appendix E: Spallation Neutron Source Science Paperelement and affords structural biology with opportunities for novel experimental design. Deuteration will be a key to fully exploiting the power of neutron techniques in addressing future challenges in struc tur al biology. The sensitivity of neutrons to hydrogen and deuterium en a bles studies of biological structure, dynamics, and function that span a wide range of length and time scales involved in cellular processes. Neutron crystallography can be applied to locate functionally important individual hydrogen atoms with near-atomic precision in biological molecules such as enzymes, DNA , and cell-wall carbohy - drates. Locating such atoms provides information on the protonation states of amino-acid resi due s and ligands, identity of solvent molecules, and nature of bonds involving hydrogen. At the longer length scales probed by small-angle scattering, membrane and fiber diffraction, and reflectom - e try, the sensitivity of neutrons to the bulk hydrogen content of materials enables researchers to determine the structures of lipids, proteins, and larger nucleic acids within intact assemblies. Such assemblies range from membrane pro t eins in detergent micelles to protein- DNA complexes (e.g., viruses and complexes involved in DNA damage repair). Through deuterium-labeling methods, this ability can be extended to protein-protein complexes. Importantly, because neutrons are highly penetrating yet nondestructive, large biological complexes can be examined in extreme envi - ronments and as they function or undergo changes. Most neutron spectroscopic methods rely on hy dr ogen to provide the inelastic neutron scattering processes that arise from structural dynamics. Such studies are further enhanced by the application of selective deuterium labeling at the levels of molecules and specific amino acids. The combination of neutron scattering and deuterium labeling opens a vast array of possibilities for experimental design. Exemplifying DOE 's investment in the future of neutron scattering in the United States, SNS represents the next generation of neutron facilities by combining a powerful pulsed neutron source with state-of- the-a rt time-of-flight scattering instrumentation. The DOE Office of Biological and Environmental Research ( BER ) and ORNL also have invested in infrastructure to foster structural biology at SNS and HFIR by establishing the Center for Structural Molecular Biology ( CSMB ). The center operates the Bio-SANS the Bio-Deuteration ) for producing isotopically enriched biological macromolecules for neutron scattering studies. These investments provide new opportunities for structural biologists interested in using neutron scattering to support their scientific programs. The staff at SNS , CSMB , and BDL are active researchers who serve and collaborate with the facilities' user communities, includ-ing scientists who are new to neutron scattering methods. New instruments at SNS , enhanced support facili t ies at CSMB and BDL , and the established and new capabilities at HFIR will add experimental capacity and allow for the study of smaller samples of more complex materials. The cur - rent and future suite of instru me nts available for studying biological systems is detailed in the Facility Paper, beginning on p. 99 , and represents the most significant advance in neutron scattering instrumentation for biology in decades. For example, the crystallography instruments TOPAZ and MaNDi at SNS and IMAGINE at HFIR are projected to signifi - cantly increase data collection efficiency. These and other instrument capabilities, together with access to routine perdeuteration of proteins at CSMB , will prove to be a key for studying enzyme mecha ni sms. T o a great extent, such studies have been limited by large sample size requirements, long data collection times, and the lack of availability (or complete absence) of suitable neutron beamlines. Other instruments at SNS will enable experiments previously not feasible with neutrons. For example, the Nanoscale Ordered Materials Diffractometer ( NOMAD ) and EQ-SANS will allow time-resolved studies of local and supramolecular structures over atomic to cellular length scales as biological systems are subjected to changing conditions, such as during industrial processes used in biofuel production. NSE will allow experi - mental access, for the first time, to dynamic time scales that correspond to the functionally important col le ctive slow motions of biological macromolecules and their complexes. In this Science Paper, researchers describe high-impact science of interest to DOE , the National Institutes of Health (NIH ), and the National Science Foundation that will be enabled by current and future capabilities at SNS and HFIR . As is com mon in s tudies of complex systems, the projects described in the following sections require the application of several complementary experimental and theoretical techniques to truly un de rstand system behavior. X-ray scat - tering, NMR spectroscopy, and electron microscopy provide complementary informa t ion that\u2014when combined with the unique data obtained by using neutrons\u2014results in a holistic picture of these systems. Such a synergistic synthesis cannot be obtained by any one experiment. Additionally, these projects require computational modeling approaches to combine the information from different experimental techniques and to aid the interpretation of neutron scatter - ing data. The key role that neutron scattering will play in the success of these projects demonstrates the growth of its importance in structural biology, a field expected to have a bright future at HFIR and SNS . Research Understanding the Molecular Machines of Genomic Main t enance Walter Chazin All organisms must maintain the integrity of their genomes to survive. Dividing cells must faithfully replicate and distrib ut e their chromosomes, and all cells must prevent the 107 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Appendix E: Spallation Neutron Source Science Paperaccu mulation of DNA damage to ensure the protein code remains accurate. DNA can be damaged during replication by reactive metabolic byproducts and mutagens present in the environment. Responding to and repairing DNA damage are critical for cell viability and disease prevention. Accumulated mutations from unrepaired damage in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes can lead to cancer. As a result, organisms have evolved elegant mechanisms for genomic maintenance. Neutron scattering at SNS affords new ways to probe these molecular machines. DNA replication, damage response, and repair processes all involve multiple biochemical steps that cannot be accom - p lished by a single protein, not even a protein composed of several domains with specific functionalities. All living organisms, therefore, have evolved multiprotein machines that exert a coordinated action to achieve these various out-comes. For example, accumulated evidence to date confirms that DNA processing machinery is dynamically assembled and disassembled in conjunction with the cell cycle and in response to encountering DNA damage. Damage response and subsequent repair of all types of DNA lesions must occur in tandem with the replication and transcription of DNA , otherwise the genes and gene products will be compromised. Thus, all aspects of DNA processing are integrated events in cellular life. The grand challenge is to understand the individual machines involved in DNA processes and their interactions as they function. T echnological developments allow investigation of the func - t ion of DNA -processing machinery at an ever-increasing level of detail and with a growing number of atomic-resolution domain structures of the proteins involved. Researchers now can begin to address the correlations among mo le cular struc - ture, cellular outcomes, and disease. A fundamental advance in understanding protein machinery is the realization of the per - vasive role of dynamics. Not only is the machine undergoing dynamic transformation, but the proteins themselves are flex - ible and constantly adapting to the progression through the steps of each process. There are many advantages to dynamic assembly and disassembly, some of which relate to overall cellular efficiency. For example, fewer copies of keystone proteins such as replication protein A ( RPA ) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) are needed because they can be recycled. Other advantages relate to the need for temporal and spatial regulation and the cross-talk between various DNA processing events in the cell. Within this dynamic context, the activity of the constituent proteins is coordinated to bring about the ordered progression of each process. Many important characteristics of the proteins and a few concepts about the operation of the machinery have been discerned. Concepts such as protein modularity, versatility of common folds, direct competition between sites, and the critical role of allostery are integrated into a frame w ork that forms the under - lying basis for the actions of DNA repair machinery.Neutron scattering experiments will play a key role in under - s tanding DNA processing machinery. In particular, critical gaps remain in our understanding of protein enzymatic action and the remodeling of the architecture of complex machinery as it moves from step to step in a given pathway or at the switch points between pathways. Neutron protein crystallography using the MaNDi instrument at SNS can provide powerful complementary information to x-ray crys t allography to elucidate unprecedented detail about the cata ly tic mechanism of DNA lesion repair. The structure and dynamics of complete, multidomain proteins composed of well-structured domains can be understood through com-bined application of small-angle EQ-SANS at SNS with contrast variation and deuterium labeling. Interpreting such data also requires the develop-ment and ap p lication of new modeling methods. Neutron crystallography and scattering, along with the other tools of structural biology, provide the ability to quantitatively charac t erize molecular machines to make the connection between their structure and disease. SNS is envisioned as offering key horizon technologies necessary for pursuing investigations of these challenging systems. Signaling Pathways: Complex Molecular Interactions and Assemblies of Protein Kinases Susan Taylor, Don Blumenthal, Patrick Hogan, and Phineus Markwick More and larger structures are being solved by conventional x-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. Y et, becoming increasingly clear with these advances are the major road - blocks still challenging the multilevel understanding of cellu-lar processes involving (1) changes in the chemi cal pr ofiles of proteins, (2) ligand interactions, (3) assembly of multiprotein complexes, and (4) proteins with flexible linkers and tails. These challenges are particularly true when attempting to model signaling pathways and signaling proteins. A major focus of our work is to understand the structure and function of protein kinase A ( PKA ), a monophosphate (c is an impor tant second messenger ligand responsible for converting an extracellular stimulus into a cascade of intracellular signaling events. The primary sensor for c AMP in mammalian cells is PKA , whose function is to phosphorylate numerous pro t eins, resulting in diverse pathways and biological responses. PKA is an inactive tetramer composed of two catalytic (C) subunits bound to a dimer of regulatory (R) subunits. Bind in g of two cAMP molecules to each R-subunit releases two catalyti - cally active C-subunits. The C-subunit was the first kinase structure to be solved and continues to serve as a prototype for understanding the structure and function of the large kinase enzyme family. Not only is PKA one of the largest gene SNS Science108 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Appendix E: Spallation Neutron Source Science Paperfamilies in mammalian cells, it also is criti cal ly important for regulating almost every biological process in the cell. At SNS, there is an enormous opportunity to move beyond the roadblocks of traditional structural biol o gy and address one of the biggest challenges facing the signaling community. Neu- tron crystallography with the MaNDi instrument at SNS could provide crucial infor m ation on the catalytic mechanism of the C-subunit. The im p act on the chemical and computational community would be profound, and the relevance of such structures for the biological community would be equally sig - nificant. The ability to solve structures of complexes consisting of the C-subunit and R-subunits adds further opportunities for neutron diffraction. Understanding the role of protons and hydrogen-bonding networks in activating an R:C complex by the binding of c AMP is another exciting opportunity. By employing the power of SNS, scientists may be able to analyze larger complexes of assembled proteins. PKA s typically function as part of large macromolecu l ar com- plexes that assemble in proximity to their protein substrates. Although higher-order structures are beginning to be solved, challenges remain because of the flexible linkers and loops that often are internal to these complexes and that connect domains or dock to other proteins in the complex. SNS will allow the use of SANS to define the position of the C-subunits in the tetramer, thus providing a powerful way to define the organization of these complexes. As research now moves forward in trying to understand the allostery created by a tetra - meric holoenzyme, SAXS and SANS will be used to understand the consequences of single mutations and domain movements associated with targeting and activa t ion. In addition, PKA is tar - geted to specific sites by scaffold proteins [A-kinase anchoring proteins AKAP s)] that bind to the small helical dimerization and docking domain in the R-subunit. Thus, with PKA , there is an opportunity to go not only from individual subunits to tet - rameric holoenzymes but also to large macromolecular assem-blies. As a prototype for such assemblies, we are characterizing the interactions of the RII subunits of PKA that targeted near 79/150 localizes PKA and CN to the tails of ion channels, such as the voltage-gated calcium channel. By anchoring the kinase and phosphatase to a small AKAP peptide containing the docking site for both proteins, we have been able to isolate stoichiometric com p lexes of CN (both the A and B subunits) and PKA (both the R-subunit dimer and the tetrameric R2C2 complex). The op por tunities for using SNS to explore the effects of c AMP and calcium on these two proteins are very exciting and provide a wonderful chance to apply SAXS and SANS technologies. In addition to SANS and crystallography, there also are new opportunities for inelastic neutron scattering and compu - t ational studies of PKA . These molecules have considerable functionally important, electrostatics-driven structural plas-ticity, a feature centrally important for drug discovery. The conformational flex i bility of PKA s provides an opportunity for both traditional inelastic neutron scattering using the BASIS instrument to probe local dynamics and the CNCS and NSE instruments to probe larger collective motions. Consid- erable progress has been made very recently in the develop-ment of computational methods to probe the structures, solvation, and dynamics of proteins and their complexes (Shaw et al. 2010; Markwick et al. 2011). Methods include those based on special-purpose computer hardware and associ a ted software (Shaw et al. 2010) and on complementary approaches based on advances in the statistical mechanical methods underlying molecular dynamics simulations (Mark-wick et al. 2011). The advances in SANS resources offered by SNS will make available corresponding experimental data on the structures, solvation, and dynamics of proteins and their complexes, allowing rapid progress in understanding the ori-gins of biological activity. Merging results from different time and length scales with the computational tools of molecular dynamics will bridge the experimental and theoretical under-standing of how these proteins work.

Structure and Function of a Membrane-Containing Virus Dennis Brown and Raquel Hernandez Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses), such as those vec - t ored by mosquitoes or ticks, are major causes of human disease. For example, dengue fever virus produces several hundred million cases of human disease per year, and 2.5 billion people are at risk. The Sindbis virus, transmitted by mosquitoes, is a prototypic member of the arboviruses. Structurally, it is composed of three proteins, two of which are glycoproteins making up an outer icosahedral protein shell. A single protein forms an inner icosahedral shell containing RNA of the virus. Between the two protein shells is a membrane bilayer derived from the host in which the virus is produced. Because arthropods are the vectors for these viruses, the membrane derived from the insect or vertebrate host can have different compositions and yet retain infectious activity between host species (Burge and Strauss 1970; Knight et al. 2009). Similarly, the glycosylation pa tt e rn of the outer shell protein derives from the host species (Renkonen et al. 1972; Renkonen et al. 1971). Previously, our group used SANS to characterize structural differences between Sindbis virus particles grown in insect and mammalian cells and found that the host influences more than the struc tur e of the membrane in the virus (see Fig. E12, p. 109 ; He et al. 2010).109 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Fig. E12. SANS profiles for Sindbis virus particles grown in a mammal (black) and insect (red). Inset shows profiles of the radial scattering length density difference derived from SANS data. The strong feature results from the lipid bilayer of the virus, and the differences therein result from the higher cholesterol content in the mammalian-grown virus particle.

Reproduced with per the American Society for Microbiology.] Appendix E: Spallation Neutron Source Science PaperThe process of infection by Sindbis virus is complex (Paredes et al. 2004). The structure of the mature virus is metastable and capable of dramatic reorganization of its surface and inner core as it delivers its RNA into a host cell. We believe that changes in its physical and chemical environment can induce many of these mor-phological changes in the virus. The virus can respond to heat and changes in ionic strength and pH in ways that can be measured by a variety of methods. Under-standing the three-dimensional structure of the mature virus and the changes it can undergo is critical to elucidating the process of infection and subsequently designing antiviral compounds to prevent it. Developing a complete understanding of the process of Sind - bis virus infection of cells is one goal of our research. We are studying the structure of Sindbis virus and its ability to change configuration using a combined experimental approach that includes mass spectrometry, electron cryo-mi cr oscopy, x-ray crystallography, and SANS . SANS has proven to be a particularly powerful tool for a number of reasons. We have developed a method of purifying Sindbis viruses so that they remain 100% infectious. The exposure to neu tr ons, in contrast to x-rays, does not decrease virus infectivity (He et al. 2010). By using SANS together with contrast variation methods uniquely enabled by neutrons, we thus can study changes in the virion and its lipid, protein, and RNA components in response to environmen- tal shifts\u2014confident that the analysis is not damaging virus infectivity. Furthermore, the inherent time-resolved nature of measurements at SNS using EQ-SANS raises the possibil it y of being able to probe conformational changes in Sindbis virus in situ. This would allow, for example, continuous monitoring of conformational changes in the structure of the virus as the pH of the solution is lowered. Such studies are impossible with other experimental techniques. References Burge, B. W., and J. H.

The first step in photosynthesis is light capture by antenna systems that absorb and transfer solar energy to the reaction centers where photochemistry occurs. The antenna systems found in photosynthetic organisms are strikingly diverse structures highly specialized to optimize capture of the maximum light energy available to an organism in its native environment. This diversity is evident in the range of different antenna complexes found in (1) cyanobacteria (phyco b ilisomes), (2) plants (light-harvesting complexes LHC I and LHC II), (3) purple photosynthetic bacteria ( LH1 and LH2), Fenna-Matthews-Olson ( FMO ) protein]\u2014all of which have different structural architectures and even di ff e rent types of light-absorbing pigment molecules. Funded by the DOE Office of Basic Energy Sciences, the Photosynthetic Antenna Research Center is an Energy Frontier Research Center dedicated to understanding the basic scientific principles of light harvesting and energy SNS Science 110 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Appendix E: Spallation Neutron Source Science Paperfunneling in antenna systems as applied to natural, biohy - br id, and biomimetic photosynthetic systems. Aspects of this problem include: S tudying the effects of size and pigment composition of natural antenna systems on the efficiency of energy con version. U nderstanding antenna regulation, control, and repair. E xtending the range of photosynthetically active radiation into other regions of the solar spectrum. D esigning hybrid and biomimetic systems so that they use the principles of natural antennae to enhance energy collec t ion and storage. Native and recombinant antenna complexes have been studied using a range of structural techniques, including x-ray crystallography, various types of microscopies, and steady-state and ultrafast spectroscopies. These studies pro - vided a wealth of information on and insight into the struc - ture and function of components such as the LH2 complex and the reaction center. However, the inherent structural heterogeneity in these systems has hampered efforts to determine how the components interact to form integrated functional pathways. In particular, the multimembrane, supramolecular organi za tion of photosynthetic pathways makes ascertaining information about the precise organiza t ion of the individual complexes difficult. Details of how the FMO antenna complex is organized in the complex architecture of the green bacterial photosynthetic apparatus are just now being elucidated. These examples illustrate the challenges in understanding the complex hierarchical machinery of photosynthetic organisms. T o comprehensively understand the overall energy-trapping and -transfer processes, structural information at many dif - ferent length scales is required. ORNL offers a powerful new suite of instruments for small-angle scatter in g, diffraction, spectroscopy, and r eflectometry\u2014all of which promise 10- to 1,000-fold gains in performance. Neutron scatter in g techniques such as small-angle scattering ( EQ-SANS and Bio-SANS ), TOPAZ , MaNDi, and IMAGINE ) can play impor t ant roles in inves - tigating natural antenna systems, such as their assembly, packing fraction, dis tr ibution, organizational structure, and pigment composition. These studies will provide insight into many facets of the photo s ynthetic process, including efficiency of light-energy conversion in plant photosyn-thetic machinery; antenna regulation, control, and repair; and design of hybrid and biomimetic antenna systems for enhanced energy collection and storage.Enzymes for Carbon Sequestration and Renewable En er gy: Carbonic Anhydrases David Silverman and Z\u00f6e Fisher Carbonic anhydrases ( CAs) are ubiquitous enzymes found in diverse organisms from humans to archaebacteria. We are investigating several CAs that have potential applica t ions in renewable energy and the environment, aiming to under - stand their detailed catalytic mechanisms. The important biochemical reaction in this system involves transferring hydrogen, an atom difficult to locate using crystallography with x-rays but easy to locate with neutrons. This capability allows us to answer many questions about CAs that have been unresolved for years despite extensive study by other complementary methods. Some key questions about CA mechanisms involve the nature of the transition state, ionization state of the zinc-bound aqueous ligand and other groups in the active-site cavity that influence ca t alysis, and the conformation of the proton transfer pathway. We plan to address these questions by preparing deuterated crystals of various CA mutants at four or five different pH (pD) values and then determine the neutron structures of each state. Such an approach simply would not have been possible even 3 years ago but is now becoming feasible due to SNS development and the increasing number of macromolecular neutron crystallography beamlines coming online. The resulting SNS -enabled discoveries on the catalytic mechanisms of CAs will be exploited to manipu l ate enzyme performance and use for renewable energy and carbon sequestration. In the recent past, researchers were fortunate to have been able to pursue a single neutron structure, which then could take years to complete. Now, with the advent of 10- to 100-fold increases in flux, scientists can actually prepare and collect neutron data from several deuterated samples under different conditions to trap intermediates and mimic catalysis by varying p H (pD) or other conditions. The Nature of the T ransition State. A long-standing issue concerning transition-state structure in ca t alysis of carbon dioxide (CO) hydration relates to the position of the hydro-gen and mode of binding to the zinc (the Lindskog versus Lipscomb model; Silverman and McKenna 2007). At least two sites on the forming bicarbonate (HCO ) are possibili- ties for hydrogen binding: one proximal to the zinc and likely hydrogen-bond e d to the side-chain hydroxyl of Thr- 199, and the other distal to the zinc and hydrogen-bonded at another site such as a water molecule in the active-site cavity. An x-ray structure of sub s trate bicarbonate bound to T200H HCA II is reported (Xue et al. 1993). Examination of such a structure by neutron diffraction that can locate hydrogen- deuterium exchangeable sites would do much to resolve this issue that has been the subject of countless experimental and computational approaches. Such capabilities are important not only for CA but also for enzymes of similar structure and mechanism, such as the zinc-containing beta-lactamases that 111 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Appendix E: Spallation Neutron Source Science Paperhydrolyze penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems and are mecha ni sms of drug resistance. The Ionization State of Active-Site Groups. Neu tron diffraction also has the capability to resolve long-standing uncertainties as to the ionization state of the zinc-bound water, the carboxyl group of Glu106, the phenol side chain of Tyr7, and the imidazole side chain of His64. All of these active-site groups play critical roles in the catalysis, and new and surprising results are being obtained from the single neutron structure so far achieved (Fisher et al. 2010). Experiments need to be performed for a series of different conditions of pH (pD), with a series of site-specific mutants related to known catalytic rates. Such results could lead to a paradigm shift in understanding the zinc-hydroxide mecha-nism of CA and related enzymes such as beta-lactamase and alkaline phosphatase. This plan requires a more rapid turn-around of structures and would be enabled by SNS . The Proton T ransfer Pathway. Detailed examination of the ionization states of both residues and the structure and hy dr ogen-bonding schemes of ordered water molecules in the active-site cavity is necessary to understand the proton transfer mechanism in CA (see Fig. E13, this page ). Information about the specific orientations of waters and the hydrogen bonding in ground-state CA structures is vital to relate structure to function. Many catalytic rates of proton transfer are currently available (Silverman and McKenna 2007; Fisher et al. 2007), but an underlying and unifying understand in g would be provided by structural details revealed by neu tr on diffraction. In particular, such structural data would be significant in estimating the relevance of the Marcus Theory of proton transfer in the active site (Silver - man et al. 1993). CA serves as an im por tant model for proton transfer through long distances in a protein environment and hence is relevant to proton transfer in more complex and vital biosystems such as ATP synthase, cytochrome oxidase, and the photosynthetic reaction center.

PT is thought to be mediated by a hydrogen-bonded network of solvent molecules (ZnHO, W1, W2, W3a, and between the cata lytic zinc and bulk solv ent. Despite the availability of atomic-resolution x-ray structures, it is still unknown whether the zinc-bound solvent is water or hydroxide, if H64 is charged or neutral, and how the solvents are oriented with respect to each other and active-site residues. Understanding how the en z yme facilitates CO hydration and proton transfer will help in devising methods for using biological systems for carbon sequestra-tion and ultimately will assist with reducing car b on emissions. This information can be used to make a better, faster enzyme that will help accomplish these goals more efficiently.

White, A. Richard Chamberlin, Douglas J. Tobias, Ella Mihailescu, David Worcester, Dmitriy Krepkiy, and Kenton Swartz Throughout the biological world, cell membranes are crucial to the life of individual cells. In animal cells, the plasma membrane is a selectively permeable barrier (primarily made up of proteins and lipids) that separates the cytosol from the cell's extracellular environment. Ionic channels constitute an important part of the cell membrane by forming a small volt - age gradient across the membrane as a result of ions flowing down their electrochemical gradients. The basis of membrane excitability (e.g., in neurons and muscle cells) is the flow of ions through voltage-gated ion channels, which consist of a single pore domain and four voltage-sensing domains ( VSD s). Conformational changes to VSD s in response to changes in transmembrane potential lead to the opening and closing of the ion-conducting pore. A team of scientists from the Uni - versity of California-Irvine, the University of Pennsyl v ania, the National Institute of Standards and T echnology Center for Neutron Research ( NCNR ), and NIH is investigating the molecular-scale details of this process, with support from an NIH Program Project grant. The primary goal of the project is to elucidate the structure and dynam ic s of VSD s\u2014as well as their surrounding membrane and associated water mol - ecules\u2014in response to changes in transmembrane potential. Neutron diffraction and reflec t ometry measurements will be used in conjunction with molecular dynamics ( MD) simula - tions. Researchers recently demonstrated the potential of the combined neutron scattering- MD simulation approach using the Advanced Neutron Diffractometer / R eflectometer (AND/R ) at NCNR (Krepkiy et al. 2009); this work can be readily expanded through the capabilities o ff e red by SNS. In September 2010, the research team carried out a neutron reflectometry experiment on the Magnetism Reflectometer at SNS using vectorially oriented VSD s and channels in mem- branes with in situ manipulation of electrochemical po t ential. Preliminary data show that the reflectivity from the team's inorganic multilayer substrates was significantly better than data from the AND/R instrument at NCNR over the accessible region of higher Q (0.15 to 0.30 \u00c5-1). The team is scheduled to begin the first experi me nts with the VSD protein vectorially oriented within fully hydrated, single bilayer membranes tethered to the surface of silicon-nickel-silicon multilayer sub - strates in an electrochemical cell. If the planned experiments are successful, the unique capabilities of SNS, coupled with the deuteration of selected residues within the VSD s, are antici - pated to help the team real i ze the goals of its ambitious project.

Crowley Cellulosic biomass is the most abundant biological material on Earth. As such, it is a vast, renewable resource for human e nergy needs, for both fuels and power. Substantial U.S. and international research efforts are focused on engineering bacte-rial enzymes to convert lignocellulosic biomass more efficiently to sugars, which then can be fermented to liquid fuels. Neutrons already are being used extensively to study various aspects of this conversion process. Those aspects include (1) The struc - ture and hydrogen bonding in cellulose us in g SANS and fiber diffraction, (2) the detailed catalytic mecha ni sms of enzymes involved in biomass hydrolysis and sugar metabolism using neutron crystallography, and (3) the pretreat me nt of cellulosic biomass using SANS and neutron spin echo spectroscopy. In addition to broadening and enhancing these existing studies, SNS will make possible new and more complex areas of research such as understanding and de v eloping cellulosomes for biofu- els. In nature, many bacteria break down lignocellulosic biomass using large, extracellular enzyme complexes\u2014cellulosomes\u2014that consist of cellulose-degrading enzymes noncovalently bound to peptide scaffolds. Although the structures of many cellulase enzyme do m ains have been solved, there are few studies that probe the solution structure of fungal enzymes or large, complexed cellu los omes. We already have used SAXS to examine enzymes from the cellulosomal bacterium Clostridium thermocellum. This work provided invaluable insights into the function of the cellu - los ome. However, the direct comparison to our extensive set of mo le cular dynamics simulations exhibited a crucial limitation: within the framework of SAXS , conducting these experiments is extremely difficult if not impossible while the cellulosome or cellulosomal enzymes are degrading cel lulos e. This difficulty arises mainly because of radiation damage by x-rays and a lack of scattering contrast between enzyme complex and substrate. Combining neutron scattering with deuterated cellulosomes would enable us to obtain direct measure me nts of the radius of gyration of these enzymes' complex \"molecular envelopes\" on cellu los e substrates. This information is extremely important for our primary investiga-tion of the multimodular enzyme CbhA (see Fig. E14, p. 113 ), a study in which we hypothesize that this enzyme adopts a radically different conformation on cellulose than in solution (i.e., a conformation in which its seven modules can work in concert). Additionally, neutron scattering is essential to probe the flexibility of the populated cellulosome and the accessible surface coverage of the cel lulos omal complex on cellulose. Neutrons represent our best hope of imaging this process in motion. Overall, this work will support our ongoing modeling 113 U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Office of Biological and Environmental Research Appendix E: Spallation Neutron Source Science Paperefforts and drive rational protein engineering approaches to design enhanced cellulo s omes for biofuels applications in the DOE BER -sponsored BioEnergy Science Center ( BESC ). BESC , a multi-institutional collaboration consisting of 19 partners, is using a multidisciplinary research program to understand and eliminate biomass recalcitrance. The program spans the biological, chemical, physical, and computational sciences, as well as mathematics and engineering. Scientists in BESC seek to improve the accessibility of the sugars within biomass through the design of plant cell walls for rapid decon-struction. Specifi cally, BESC is working with two potential bioenergy crops, switchgrass and Populus, to develop varieties that are easier to break down into fermentable sugars. BESC also is developing multitalented microbes for converting plant bio m ass into biofuels through consolidated bioprocessing.
