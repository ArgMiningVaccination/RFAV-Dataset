Brunton, MD, FAAFP Two decades ago, the American Medical Associa- tion found evidence indicating that gender dis-parities occurred in clinical practice and urged physicians to take appropriate action. 1 A decade later, the Institute of Medicine called for a better understand-ing of the differences between women and men, beyond the known biological differences, and that this understanding be integrated into clinical practice. 2 And yet gender-related differences remain. The crude mortality rate for ischemic heart disease-related deaths declined 36.3% for women and 26.5% for men from 2000 to 2009. 3 In 2010, the hospitalization rate for diabetes-related problems was half the rate in women as in men.4 Women are more likely to experience more severe rheumatoid arthritis, with worse disability and pain, compared to men. 5,6 Women are also more likely than men to receive potentially inappro-priate medications (18.1% vs 11.8%) 4 and to have less positive experiences while hospitalized.7 While better appreciated than 2 decades ago, gender- related differences remain an important issue in clinical practice. This supplement includes 8 articles that focus on the needs and considerations in providing care to women. In the first of several articles that focus on cardiometa- bolic diseases, Dr. JoAnne Foody reviews clinical experience with the 2 newest antiplatelet agents, prasugrel and ticagrelor, in the management of women with acute coronary syndrome. Recommendations regarding transition of care following hos-pitalization are also provided. Dr. Michael Cobble focuses on patient assessment and treatment strategies for primary pre-vention of coronary heart disease in women. Succinct recom- Stephen A.

Drs. Donna Ryan and Jill Braverman-Panza highlight overarch-ing principles in the management of overweight or obesity in women. In addition to key considerations in assessment, the contemporary management of overweight and obesity in primary care is described. Dr. Penny Tenzer-Iglesias describes key risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus in women as well as important complications, such as cardiovascular disease and sexual and urologic problems. The implications of psychoso-cial well-being, benefits of self-care, and coping strategies in women with type 2 diabetes mellitus are also provided. Dr. Gary Ruoff summarizes the contemporary manage- ment of early rheumatoid arthritis in women in primary care, with a focus on the role of corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Drs. Jennifer Niebyl and Gerald Briggs outline the assessment and management of women with preg-nancy-related nausea and vomiting. The roles of nonpharma-cologic and pharmacologic options are discussed, including the reintroduction in the United States of doxylamine succi-nate/pyridoxine hydrochloride. Dr. Pamela Ellsworth reviews the symptom complex of idiopathic overactive bladder and the importance of behavioral modification as first-line therapy. The selection and use of antimuscarinic agents are reviewed and details provided about the 2 newest treatment options, mirabegron and onabotulinumtoxinA. Finally, Dr. Roger Cady discusses migraine headaches in women and the characteris-tics that differentiate chronic migraine from episodic migraine. Dr. Cady reviews the limited evidence regarding abortive and preventive pharmacologic treatment of chronic migraine, with additional approaches based on his experience. It is my hope that the insights provided by the authors will be helpful to family physicians in managing their female patients with these common diseases. l REFERENCES 1 .

S2 FEBRUARY 2014 | Vol 63, No 2 | Supplement to The Journal of Family Practice S3 Supplement to The Journal of Family Practice | Vol 63, No 2 | FEBRUARY 2014Antiplatelet Therapy in Women With Acute Coronary Syndrome JoAnne Foody, MD, FACC, FAHA BACKGROUND Heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States, yet many individuals are unaware of their cor - onary heart disease (CHD) risk. Up to 50% of men and 64% of women who die suddenly of CHD had no previous symp - toms. 1,2 The risk of death is particularly high following a myo - cardial infarction (MI). In the first year following an MI, 26% of women over the age of 45 years die, rising to 47% within 5 years of a first MI. Since the 1980s, these death rates have declined slightly in most age groups. However, in women aged 35 to 44 years, the rate has been increasing annually by an average of 1.3%. 2 This rate increase in younger women is observed at a time when risk factors such as abdominal obesity, diabetes, and hypertension are also increasing in the population. 3 Despite improvements in knowledge and perception of cardiovascular disease (CVD), a recent survey conducted by the American Heart Association found that only 54% of women were aware that heart disease was the leading cause of death in women. 2 The incidence of CVD remains higher in men than in women in all age categories; however, the gap between women and men narrows following menopause. 2,4 Differ - ences in platelet biology and response to antiplatelet therapy have been hypothesized as possibly contributing to the gen - der differences observed. 4 Antiplatelet agents are included as key treatment options for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in recent updates to non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) guidelines from the American College of Cardiology, the American Heart Association, and the Society for Cardiovas - JoAnne Foody, MD, FACC, FAHA, Associate Professor, Harvard Medical School; Director of the Pollin Cardiovascular Wellness Program, Brigham and Women's Hospital; Director, Pollin Project for Cardiovascular Disease in Women, Boston, MA DiSClOSUR eS Dr. Foody discloses that she is on the advisory boards for Bristol- Myers Squibb Company; Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Merck & Co.; and Sanofi US.

Recommendations for transition of care from the hospital to the primary care setting for women will also be discussed. GeNDeR-RelATeD DiFFeReNCeS iN ACUTe CORONARY SYNDROMe Acute coronary syndrome occurs as a result of atherosclerotic plaque rupture, platelet activation, and thrombus formation within a coronary artery. 9 Platelet aggregation is critical to the development of an occlusive thrombus and increased platelet reactivity has been associated with an elevated risk of acute coronary events. 9 Studies comparing platelet function in women and men have demonstrated that women have higher baseline platelet reactivity and aggregation. 10-12 This increase in platelet reactivity can result in an increased risk of ischemic events in some women. 13-15 Inflammation Inflammation can augment platelet response and further enhance platelet activation. One of the most widely studied markers of inflammation in cardiovascular risk has been high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). Data in women and men show that hs-CRP levels are independently associ - ated with risk for CHD, although the data are less consistent in women. 16-18 In a substudy of the Cardiovascular Health Study, hs-CRP levels did not add to the risk prediction in women at low and intermediate risk for CHD. 17 Current guideline recommendations do not include hs-CRP as a pre - dictor of risk for CVD in women because there are no data to support an association between a reduction in hs-CRP and clinical outcomes. 19 Female hormones The role that female hormones play in CVD risk and plate - let activity is not completely understood. Early evidence suggested a relationship between platelet aggregability and menstrual cycle phase. 20 In addition, megakaryocytes and platelets have been found to express both estrogen and S3 Supplement to The Journal of Family Practice | Vol 63, No 2 | FEBRUARY 2014S4 [ANTIPLATELET THERAPY IN wom EN] androgen receptors.21 However, more recent data do not sup - port a correlation with menstrual phase and hyperreactivity in platelets.11,22 The Women's Health Initiative was a large trial designed to study the clinical effects of hormone replacement therapy on CVD in women. 23 Given the observation that premeno - pausal women have a lower risk of heart disease than post - menopausal women, it was postulated that estrogen provides a cardioprotective effect. However, administering hormone therapy did not result in a lower risk of CVD in postmeno - pausal women. 23 With the complexity and multiple pathways involved in platelet activation and aggregation, there is a need for continued research in order to better understand the role of gender and hormones in thrombosis and risk of CVD. CliNiCAl PHARMACO lOGY OF ANT iPlATeleT AGeNTS AND US e iN WOM eN WiTH ACUT e CORONARY SYNDROM e Aspirin The benefits of antiplatelet agents in the prevention and treat - ment of ACS have been well established. Although an increas - ing variety of antiplatelet agents are used in the management of CVD, aspirin remains 1 of the most studied. The antiplatelet effects of aspirin occur as a result of irreversible inactivation of cyclooxygenase-1 ( COx-1). This effect occurs at daily doses as low as 81 to 162 mg, whereas higher doses exert an addi - tional effect on cyclooxygenase-2 (C Ox-2), resulting in inhi its vasodilatory properties. 24,25 Rec- ommended doses range from 81 to 325 mg daily, with lower doses (81 mg daily) preferred for most patients. 6,8,19 Studies have found that platelet response to aspirin in women is similar to men, although overall platelet reactivity remains slightly higher in women, which is possibly due to higher baseline platelet reactivity. 11,12,26 Some clinical studies have found a benefit in women for primary prevention, while others have not. 27,28 The evidence suggests that the primary benefit in women is in prevention of ischemic strokes, but at the expense of an increased risk of bleeding. 27,29,30 Therefore, while the use of aspirin for primary prevention in women is controversial, aspirin is recommended for primary pre - vention in women 65 years or older who are at moderate or severe risk for CVD. 19,29,31 For secondary prevention, the ben - efits of aspirin are clear and aspirin is recommended for all women following ACS, including those who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). 5,6,8 Adenosine diphosphate receptor antagonists The oral antiplatelet agents used in conjunction with aspi - rin for the prevention of cardiovascular thrombotic events in patients with ACS are the adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor antagonists. 6-8 The thienopyridine class of recep - tor antagonists includes clopidogrel and prasugrel; ticlopidine is no longer recommended. These agents exert their antiplate - let effect by irreversibly modifying the P2Y 12 receptor neces - sary for binding ADP and activating platelets. Ticagrelor is the newest ADP receptor antagonist and is in the cyclopentyltri - azolopyrimidine class. In contrast to clopidogrel and prasug - rel, ticagrelor reversibly inhibits the P2Y 12 receptor.32,33 Despite the numerous studies evaluating the use of ADP receptor antagonists in the treatment of ACS, there is limited data that specifically examined their gender-related effects. Clopidogrel Clopidogrel has been available in the United States since 1997 and has been studied in a wide variety of thrombotic CVDs. It had been recommended as first-line therapy for secondary prevention in all patients with an MI. 31,34 Clopidogrel is a pro - drug and requires a 2-step activation process that includes metabolism by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2C19 and CYP3A4) to produce an active metabolite. 32,33 More than one-third of Europeans and over 40% of persons of African or Asian ancestry have genetic variants that lead to loss of func - tion in their CYP2C19 isoform. 33,35 This loss of function leads to lower plasma concentrations of the active metabolite.33 In addition, various drugs (ie, proton pump inhibitors) inhibit the CYP2C19 isoform and slow the metabolism of clopido - grel to its active form. 36 Lower levels of active metabolite can result in subtherapeutic antiplatelet effects and potentially worse clinical outcomes. 32,37-39 In 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration added a \"boxed warning\" to the clopidogrel label, suggesting genetic testing for patients prior to initiating clopidogrel therapy. The clinical and practical implementa - tion of genetic testing has been questioned and remains a challenge. 35,38-40 Of the 3 oral ADP antagonists available, the greatest amount of data in women is found in studies of clopidogrel. A study in healthy volunteers (23 male, 38 female) demon - strated less of a response in women to a single dose of clopi - dogrel 600 mg compared with men (platelet inhibition 40% in females vs 65% in males, P = 0.04) and a higher percent - age of women meeting the definition of \"nonresponders\" compared with men (63% women vs 6% male, P = 0.002). 12 Platelet reactivity has also been assessed in postmenopausal women (n = 102) and men (n = 128) with known CVD and prior PCI on aspirin and clopidogrel therapy for at least 4 months. 41 In this prospective, observational study, women were found to have higher platelet aggregation than men.41 The clinical implications of these trials were assessed in a meta-analysis that included 5 clopidogrel trials specifically S4 FEBRUARY 2014 | Vol 63, No 2 | Supplement to The Journal of Family Practice S5 Supplement to The Journal of Family Practice | Vol 63, No 2 | FEBRUARY 2014 [ANTIPLATELET THERAPY IN wom EN] evaluating clinical outcomes in women compared with men.42 Compared with placebo, clopidogrel reduced cardiovascular events in both women and men, although at the expense of a higher risk of major bleeding ( Table 1 ). In women, the benefit was primarily due to a significant reduction in MI, with no sig - nificant effect on stroke or total death. In men, the risks of MI, stroke, and total death were significantly reduced with clopi - dogrel compared with placebo. Clopidogrel remains a class I recommendation for women and men following ACS or PCI with stent implantation. 6-8 Given the variable response due to genetic variability, genetic testing is suggested prior to initi - ating therapy in select patients, such as those at high risk for poor clinical outcomes. 6,7 Prasugrel Prasugrel is also in the thienopyridine class of ADP receptor antagonists but only requires 1 step for activation. The onset and extent of platelet inhibition is much more predictable and less variable with prasugrel than with clopidogrel. 43-46 This improved platelet inhibition compared to clopidogrel results in better clinical outcomes. 45,47 In the Trial to Assess Improvement in Therapeutic Outcomes by Optimizing Plate - let Inhibition with Prasugrel-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 38 (TRITON-TIMI 38), patients undergoing PCI experienced fewer ischemic events with prasugrel than with clopidogrel (9.9% vs 12.1%, P < 0.001), but an increased risk of major bleeding with prasugrel (2.4% vs 1.1%, respectively; P < 0.001). 45,47 Currently, prasugrel is only recommended for use in patients with ACS who are to be managed with PCI.48 Data specific to women are limited to a subgroup analy - sis found within the original publication.45 In women, prasu - grel and clopidogrel were similarly effective in reducing the primary endpoint (death from cardiovascular causes, nonfa - tal MI, or nonfatal stroke). In men, prasugrel was found to be significantly more effective than clopidogrel. The efficacy of prasugrel was similar in women compared to men ( Table 2 ). Consequently, current guidelines recommend prasugrel in patients undergoing PCI without any differentiation between men and women. 6-8 Ticagrelor Ticagrelor does not require activation to become biologically active and, similar to prasugrel, has a more rapid onset and pre - dictable response compared with clopidogrel. 32,49,50 Ticagrelor binds reversibly to the P2Y12 receptor and, due to its relatively short elimination half-life (7 hours for ticagrelor and 9 hours for the active metabolite), must be administered twice daily in contrast to clopidogrel and prasugrel, which require once daily dosing. The Study of Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes (PLATO) compared ticagrelor to clopidogrel in patients with ACS (both STEMI and NSTEMI) who were medically or inva - sively managed (PCI/coronary artery bypass graft [CABG]). 49 Ticagrelor reduced cardiovascular outcomes (death from vascular causes, MI, or stroke) compared with clopidogrel (9.8% vs 11.7%, P < 0.001) and the rate of death from any cause was also reduced with ticagrelor. There was no difference in the overall rate of major bleeding, but non-CABG-related major bleeding was more common with ticagrelor (4.5% vs 3.8%; P = .03). Of note, the subgroup of North American patients did not demonstrate improvement with ticagrelor and fur - ther analyses attributed this outcome to the higher dose of aspirin used in the United States compared with outside the United States. 51 As a result, it is recommended that ticagre - lor be administered with an aspirin dosage not exceeding 100 mg/day. Ticagrelor is currently indicated to reduce the rate of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with ACS. 52 Several PLATO substudies have evaluated specific patient groups, but only 1 recent analysis reported out - comes in women.53 This subset analysis of 5288 women and 13,336 men suggests that men and women had similar rates of the composite primary endpoint (cardiovascular death, MI, and stroke) and of all-cause mortality, but women had less overall major bleeding due to lower use of CABG surgery. In women with ACS, ticagrelor reduced ischemic events and mortality compared with clopidogrel without an increase in major bleeding ( Table 2 ).49,53 Current guidelines recommend the use of ticagrelor without any differentiation between men and women. 6-8 Clinical considerations The use of any antiplatelet agent involves balancing the benefits (reduction in CV morbidity and mortality) with the risks (bleeding and its complications). 54-56 Several studies have found that female gender is associated with increased risk of bleeding, particularly in those undergoing PCI (odds ratio, 1.3 to 2.6). 4,55,57-59 The reason for the increased risk in women is not completely understood; thus, close monitor - ing is recommended. Given the increased risk of bleeding observed in women and the chance of diminished responsiveness to antiplate - let therapy, testing for platelet reactivity would seem to be of potential benefit. 60,61 Studies of platelet function testing to guide antiplatelet therapy, however, have not consistently demonstrated this benefit clinically. 44,61,62 Consequently, cur - rent guidelines do not recommend that platelet function test - ing prior to ADP receptor antagonist therapy be performed.6,7 In summary, the use of aspirin (81 mg/day preferred maintenance dose) for secondary prevention of CVD is recommended in women, whereas aspirin is only rec - ommended in select female patients for primary preven -S6 FEBRUARY 2014 | Vol 63, No 2 | Supplement to The Journal of Family Practice [ANTIPLATELET THERAPY IN wom EN] tion.5,6,8,19,29,31 Despite the limited analyses comparing results in women vs men, the use of an ADP receptor antagonist in addition to aspirin is recommended for all patients follow - ing an ACS, particularly patients who undergo PCI with stent implantation.5-8 Data suggest that clopidogrel therapy may be somewhat less effective and somewhat less safe in women than in men, although the mechanisms underlying these dif - ferences are unclear. 12,41 TABLE 1 Results of a meta-analysis of clopidogrel in women and men42 Population Outcomes in women and men Various populations including ACS and PCI (N = 79,613; women: n = (OR, 1.22; 95% CI: 1.05 to 1.42) TABLE 2 Outcomes in women and men with prasugrel and ticagrelor Study Population Outcomes TRITON-TIMI 3845 Prasugrel 60 mg x 1, then 10 mg QDorClopidogrel 300 mg x 1, then 75 mg QD for 6-15 monthsModerate- to high-risk ACS undergoing PCI N = 13,608 Women: n = 3523;Men: n = cross 1.00) PLATO 49,53 Ticagrelor 180 mg x 1, then 90 mg BID or Clopidogrel 300-600 mg x 1, then 75 mg QD for 12 monthsACS with or without PCI N = 18,624 Women: n = 5288Men: n = 13,336CV percutaneous intervention.

Discontinuing the antiplatelet regimen (eg, for issues related to medication costs) may place the patient at increased risk of a recurrent event. 71 In addition to medi - cation adherence, coordination of care with the patient's health care team to provide comprehensive cardiovascular risk reduction, including weight management, smoking ces - sation (avoidance of secondhand smoke), blood pressure control, healthy lipid levels, and management of diabetes, is important. 8 This is another opportunity for the primary care provider to advise the patient on appropriate care following ACS as part of a comprehensive posthospitalization plan of care in collaboration with other health care providers. 8 CONClUSiON Differences in platelet reactivity between men and women exist and limited data suggest that response to antiplatelet therapy may be different in women compared with men. The exact mechanism and influence of genetic determinants and hormones on CVD in women has not been fully elucidated. The use of genetic testing and platelet reactivity testing may be beneficial in some patients, but their roles in routine clini - cal practice remain controversial. As primary prevention for cardiovascular events, aspirin has not consistently demon - strated benefit in women and is only recommended in select patients. For secondary prevention, women and men achieve similar outcomes with antiplatelet therapy. Assessing medi - cation compliance, performing comprehensive risk reduc - tion, and referring to cardiac rehabilitation are proven to be beneficial for all women with CVD and should continue to be promoted by primary care physicians. lRefe Rences 1.

The overall prevalence of CHD is estimated to be 5.1% in women compared with 7.9% in men. 1 Moreover, the lifetime risk of developing CHD after 40 years of age is 32% in women and 49% in men; in addition, the incidence of CHD in women lags behind men by 10 years for CHD overall and by 20 years for myocardial infarction (MI) and sudden death. 1 Other evidence suggests that women carry a heavier car- diovascular burden due to CHD because women generally face a worse prognosis than men following a primary event. 1,4 For example, after a first MI, 26% of women and 19% of men aged 45 years or older die within 1 year and 47% and 36%, respectively, die within 5 years. In addition, within 5 years after a first MI, 18% of women and 8% of men aged 45 to 64 years develop heart failure. 1 In patients with known CHD Michael Cobble, MD, FAAFP, FNLA, Diplomate, American Board of Clinical Lipidology; Certified Hypertension Specialist, private practice, Sandy, UT; Adjunct Faculty, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT DisC L o sures Dr. Cobble discloses that he receives a salary from Atherotech Car-diometabolic Lab.

In women, 20% to 40% of coronary thrombi occur on an intact plaque with superficial athero-intimal erosion, and women generally have less obstructive CHD. 7-9 It is also likely that patient and provider awareness impact the burden of CHD in women. While awareness by women of the contribution of major risk factors to CHD has increased over the past 15 years, women at highest risk are the least aware. 10-12 In addition, women generally receive fewer preventive services for CHD and less treatment inten-sification than do men. 13,14 Significant knowledge deficits among health care providers are a likely contributing factor.15 Understanding the differences between women and men regarding CHD has important clinical management implications. This review is similar to a review of CHD in men published in a supplement to The Journal of Family Practice in June 2012 16; however, this review emphasizes the differences between women and men regarding key risk factors, patient assessment, and treatment for primary prevention of CHD. risK FACT ors T raditional risk factors Common risk factors for CHD, such as hypertension, dyslip-idemia, abdominal obesity, diabetes mellitus, and smoking, are highly prevalent in women, with many having a greater impact and/or prevalence than in men. 6,17-19 With respect to dyslipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia is especially important and appears to confer a greater risk in women compared with men. 20,21 Furthermore, the ratio of triglyceride to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is a strong, independent predictor of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events in women. One investigation showed that women in the highest triglyceride/HDL-C ratio quartile (3.66 to 18.4) had nearly twice as many cardiovascular events as women in the S9 Supplement to The Journal of Family Practice | Vol 63, No 2 | FEBRUARY 2014[CORONARY HEART DISEASE IN WOMEN] lowest triglyceride/HDL-C ratio quartile (0.35 to <1.4) over 6 years of follow-up.10 Smoking is also especially consequen - tial in women, conferring a 25% increase in CHD risk com - pared with male smokers.22 Since hypertriglyceridemia and tobacco use confer a higher risk in women, targeting them with lifestyle management and patient support is essential. Estimates from the Second National Health and Nutri - tion Examination Survey (NHANES II) baseline data and 17-year mortality follow-up data indicate that 64% of CHD-related deaths in women could be avoided by eliminating 3 major risk factors: total cholesterol 240 mg/dL, hyperten - sion, and smoking. 23 Unfortunately, multiple investigations show that many adults do not achieve low-density lipopro - tein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride, or blood pressure (BP) targets and that approximately 20% of adults smoke cigarettes. 24-29 The importance of addressing these unmet goals cannot be overstated, because a greater cardiac risk factor burden in middle age is associated with poorer quality of life, higher incidence of cardiovascular events, and higher medical costs in older age. 1,30 However, about half of patients with CHD are not diagnosed until symptoms become apparent\u2014 typically after middle age. 31 For these reasons, it is of para - mount importance that assessment and appropriate inter - ventions targeting risk factors for CHD in women, including psychosocial factors, begin in early adulthood. Psychosocial factors Psychosocial factors play an important role in a woman's risk of future CHD-related events. The factors listed in Table 1 can increase or reduce the risk for CHD in women.32-38 The com - bination of several common psychosocial factors (depres - sion, perceived stress, and life events) confers a risk for MI at a rate comparable to that of current and former smoking. 19 Importantly, many psychosocial risk factors in women con - fer higher risk than in men.19 CLiNiCAL AssessMeNT Despite the large number of possible risk factors, the assess - ment of CHD risk can generally be kept simple to facilitate consistent application in clinical practice. The assessment should include a family, social, and personal medical his - tory, and a physical examination. It is important to keep in mind that the presentation of CHD in women may be more subtle than in men. Fatigue is the most common prodromal symptom of an acute MI in women. Other common symp - toms include sleep disturbance, anxiety, shortness of breath, and frequent indigestion; only one-third of women report any chest discomfort or pain during the prodromal period. 39 Women with the following characteristics are more likely to experience a higher number and severity of prodromal symptoms: non-Caucasian, younger age, obese, personal history of cardiovascular disease, and smoking history. 40 Ini- tial laboratory evaluation should include the lipid profile and glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c). Beyond the triglyceride level, the importance of apolipoprotein (apo) levels to cardiovas - cular risk continues to emerge.41 The apo B concentration represents the sum of the atherogenic lipoprotein particles found on non-HDL-C, whereas the apo A concentration represents the sum of the antiatherogenic lipoprotein par - ticles found on HDL-C. The apo B and/or non-HDL-C lev - els in particular may be more useful than LDL-C to assess residual cardiovascular risk and determine the need for medication adjustments, once the LDL-C target is attained. 41 HDL-C <50 mg/dL is a risk factor for cardiometabolic syn - drome in women and HDL-C <40 mg/dL is a cardiovascular risk factor, based on National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines. 42 HDL-C is not the tar - get of therapy, but rather a predictor of risk. For global risk management, the best evidence supports controlling BP and LDL-C, tobacco cessation, and lifestyle management, which includes diet, exercise, and stress support therapies. The Framingham Risk Score (www.framinghamheartstudy.org/risk/gencardio. html) and the Reynolds Risk Score (www.reynoldsriskscore.org) can be used to estimate the 10-year risk of CHD. TreATMeNT The principal treatment goal in a woman (or man) with 1 or more modifiable risk factors for CHD is to prevent an initial or primary cardiovascular event. The strategies to achieve this goal in women are the same as in men, as there are few data suggesting a gender-related difference in response and benefit. Lifestyle changes consisting of a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-like diet, smoking cessation, regular physical activity, and weight management are cor - nerstones of overall management. 43 In addition, increasing adherence to a Mediterranean style diet, particularly if sup - plemented with olive oil or nuts, is inversely related to the risk of cardiovascular disease in women. 44-46 Lipids The benefits of preventing a first episode of MI or stroke by lowering LDL-C have been clearly demonstrated in numer - ous clinical trials. 47-50 The cardiovascular benefits associated with lowering LDL-C have been demonstrated in individu - als with large as well as modest elevations of or even normal LDL-C. Results of the Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) (N = 17,802) showed that the rates of the pri - S10 FEBRUARY 2014 | Vol 63, No 2 | Supplement to The Journal of Family Practice S11 Supplement to The Journal of Family Practice | Vol 63, No 2 | FEBRUARY 2014 [CORONARY HEART DISEASE IN WOMEN] mary endpoint (MI, stroke, arterial revascularization, hos - pitalization for unstable angina, or cardiovascular death) were significantly lower in persons with LDL-C <130 mg/dL and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein 2 mg/L at baseline who were treated with rosuvastatin compared with placebo (0.77 vs 1.36 events per 100 person-years of follow-up; P < .00001). 50 The benefits of progressively lowering the LDL-C level have been demonstrated in 2 meta-analyses.51,52 For example, the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' Collabora - tion (N = 169,138) found that all-cause mortality was reduced by 10% for every 39 mg/dL reduction in LDL-C ( P < .0001). This was largely due to a 20% reduction in deaths due to CHD ( P < .0001) and an 11% reduction in deaths due to other cardiac causes ( P = .002). 51 Additional clinical trials provide further support for the cardiovascular benefits of intensive high-dose statin therapy. 53 The Study of Coronary Atheroma by Intravascular Ultrasound: Effect of Rosuvastatin versus Atorvastatin (SATURN) demonstrated reductions in coro - nary atheroma volume of 1.22% with rosuvastatin 40 mg/day and 0.99% with atorvastatin 80 mg/day over 104 weeks. 54 The long-term benefits of statin therapy have been demonstrated as well, with benefits sustained after 11 years. 55-57 Although high-dose statin therapy has demonstrated sig - nificant cardiovascular risk reduction, there is an increased risk of myotoxicity and hepatotoxicity. In addition, a pos - sible association with new-onset diabetes has been raised observationally. In the JUPITER trial, patients treated with a statin experienced a 25% higher incidence of new-onset dia - betes compared with those receiving placebo. 50 Significant increases in HbA1c and fasting plasma insulin levels have also been observed with various doses of atorvastatin, compared with placebo, after 8 weeks (all P < .01). 58 However, a meta- analysis of 6 major statin clinical trials (N = 57,593) showed no significant increase in the risk of diabetes with statin therapy compared with placebo ( P = .38). 59 Further analysis TABLE 1 Association of psychosocial factors with coronary heart disease risk in women32-38 Increased risk for CHD in women Unclear association with CHD risk in womenReduced risk for CHD in women Depression Anger suppression Stress -High demand and low control at work-Experienced at both home and work Low social support/interaction Frequent loneliness Health self-rated as fair/poor Anxiety Hostility Large social network Presence of a spouse/partner Optimism Positive psychological attributes Abbreviation: CHD, coronary heart disease. of 5 major statin trials involving 32,752 patients without dia - betes at baseline demonstrated a 12% higher risk of develop - ing diabetes mellitus with intensive- versus moderate-dose statin therapy.60 Based on these results, the investigators determined that 1 additional case of diabetes mellitus would result from treating 498 patients with intensive-dose statin therapy for 1 year, whereas 1 additional case of a cardiovas - cular event would be avoided by treating only 155 patients for 1 year. These findings support the greater cardiovascular ben - efit with intensive statin therapy, compared with a relatively low risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus. Although differences among the statins have been suggested, the association of high-dose statin therapy with diabetes mellitus is considered a class effect. 60-63 For any individual who is high risk or who is at risk for diabetes, it is reasonable to monitor for glucose changes, which can include fasting glucose, HbA1c, and post - prandial glucose. Blood pressure The cardiovascular benefits associated with lowering BP are also well established. As with dyslipidemia, the BP goal is based on risk factors and risk equivalents. In most people, BP <140/90 mm Hg is appropriate. 64 The selection of anti - hypertensive therapy is based on concomitant diseases and patient characteristics (Figure) . Monotherapy is often not effective in reaching the BP targets, as antihypertensive agents only provide modest BP reductions at recommended initial doses (Table 2) .65-73 Con - sequently, current guidelines recommend initiating anti - hypertensive therapy with 2 agents for patients with stage 2 hypertension (BP 160/100 mm Hg). 64 Smoking cessation Tobacco dependence is a chronic disease that often requires repeated intervention and multiple attempts to quit. Because S12 FEBRUARY 2014 | Vol 63, No 2 | Supplement to The Journal of Family Practice [CORONARY HEART DISEASE IN WOMEN] mum, this includes counseling and medication, preferably in combination, as this is more effective than either alone. Effective counseling approaches include individual, group, and telephone counseling. The 2 most effective components of counseling are practical counseling (problem solving and skills training) and social support. Medications approved for smoking cessation include nicotine replacement products as well as bupropion and varenicline, which do not contain nic - otine. Nicotine replacement products are available without prescription (gum, lozenge, skin patch) and by prescription (nasal spray, oral inhaler). 77 Patient education resources are available from the following websites: Be Tobacco Free: http://betobaccofree.hhs.gov/ smoke Free: http://www.smokefree.gov/ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - smoking Cessation: http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/cessation/ quitting/index.htm FDA 101 - smoking Cessation Products: http://www.fda.gov/forconsumers/consumerupdates/ucm198176.htm American Cancer society - Guide to Quitting smoking: http://www.cancer.org/healthy/stayawayfromtobacco/guideto quittingsmoking/index American Lung Association - stop smoking: http://www.lung.org/stop-smoking/ suMMAr Y Coronary heart disease results in a worse prognosis follow - ing a primary event in women than in men, thus demonstrat - ing the critical importance of primary prevention in at-risk individuals beginning early in adulthood. A medical history, physical examination, laboratory determination of lipid and HbA 1c levels, as well as assessment of psychosocial factors, including tobacco use, provide a good initial estimate of car - diovascular risk in women. Women with coronary ischemia often present atypically, without dramatic chest pain, but with more subtle symptoms. Assessing traditional risk factors, as well as long-term risk screening, may help identify the higher-risk patients for evaluation and treatment. Statin therapy is generally used to lower LDL-C, whereas antihypertensive therapy is selected based on patient comorbidities and drug side effects. Addressing lifestyle and psychosocial factors is an important part of a comprehensive plan for cardiovascular risk reduction in women. l Refe Rences 1.

First, effective November 29, 2011, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services approved Medicare coverage for intensive behavioral therapy for obesity as a stand-alone billable service.1 Second, the American Medi - cal Association adopted a policy on June 18, 2013, recognizing obesity as a disease requiring a range of medical interventions to advance obesity treatment and prevention.2 In addition, the US Food and Drug Administration approved 2 medications, lorcase - rin (Belviq) and phentermine/topiramate extended-release (Qsymia), as adjuncts to a reduced-calorie diet and increased Donna H.

In 1999-2000, 33.4% of women and 27.5% of men were obese (BMI 30 kg/m2). In 2009-2010, the prevalence had increased in women to 35.8% and dramatically in men to 35.5%.6 Perhaps most alarming is that the prevalence of extreme obesity (BMI >40 kg/m2) rose from 3.9% to 6.6% of the US population (70% increase) from 2000 to 2010. The prevalence of extreme obesity is about 50% higher among women than men.7 S15 Supplement to The Journal of Family Practice | Vol 63, No 2 | FEBRUARY 2014 FIGURE Recent events related to obesity1-4 Abbreviations: FDA, Food and Drug Administration; PCP , primary physician. S16 [OBESITY IN WOMEN] adults as a BMI 30 kg/m2 and overweight as a BMI between 25 and 29.9 kg/m2. Waist circumference is a practical surrogate measure of abdominal visceral fat.8 Waist circumference is measured at the level of the iliac crest at the end of normal expiration, with the tape measure snug but not compressing the skin and parallel to the floor. A waist circumference >35 inches (88 cm) in women and >40 inches (102 cm) in men is con - sidered a cardiovascular risk factor.8 Of course, assessment of risk factors for obesity-related comorbidities is foundational, and BP , lipids, and glycemic measures all contribute to risk assessment of overweight and obese patients. The Edmonton Obesity Staging System, which includes these and other vari - ables, can be used to stage obesity for the purposes of guiding intervention (http://www.drsharma.ca/edmonton-obesity- staging-system.html). A brief behavioral assessment is recommended, as the findings may be helpful in determining when and what treat - ment should be initiated. Employing motivational interview - ing (http://www.motivationalinterview.org/) and assessing \"stage of change\" (http://www.uri.edu/research/cprc/trans - theoretical.htm) may be helpful.30 Past weight loss attempts, treatments utilized, and reasons and barriers for success or failure should be determined, as should the presence of an eating disorder. When the patient is seeking assistance with weight loss, the reasons should be identified. In women, a desire to change body image is common.31,32 MANAGEMENT Goals There are 2 broad goals for weight management: (1) reduce the risk of obesity-related comorbidities and (2) reduce and maintain the desired body weight over the long term. To reduce body weight, a daily energy deficit of ~500-1000 kcal is generally targeted.8 While patients often wish to lose at least 30% of body weight, a more realistic goal is 10% within 6 months.8,32-35 It should be noted that setting realistic goals does not lead to more favorable weight loss outcomes, but not addressing patient expectations may lead to patient disappointment.33,34,36 General considerations Several overarching management considerations should be kept in mind. As noted above, obesity should be managed using the chronic care model. In the same way that a patient with diabetes or hypertension is managed to achieve and maintain glycemic or BP targets, the obese patient should be managed to achieve and maintain individualized weight- related targets. As a largely self-managed disease, achieving and maintaining these targets depends on a patient's knowl -In addition to the possibility of social stigmatization and discrimination, obesity is associated with numerous health problems, including cardiovascular disease, T2DM, can - cer, musculoskeletal conditions, and sleep apnea, as well as increased mortality.8-11 In obese women, a higher risk of endometrial, cervical, breast, and possibly ovarian cancer is observed. Obesity is also associated with depression, men - orrhagia, amenorrhea, stress incontinence, polycystic ovary syndrome, and infertility in women, while obesity during pregnancy is associated with negative fetal outcomes.8,10 Conversely, weight loss in obese individuals is associ - ated with a lower incidence of health problems.12-18 Modest weight loss (5%-10%) can prevent the development of T2DM in susceptible individuals as shown by a 58% reduction over 3 years in the Diabetes Prevention Program.19 The Look AHEAD trial (N = 5145), a large, long-term study of the health benefits of lifestyle intervention for weight loss, demon - strated the benefits of modest weight loss. These included improvements in glycemic control, blood pressure (BP), blood lipids, and overall fitness that began shortly after lifestyle intervention, with a mean weight loss of 8.6% at 1 year compared with 1% weight loss in the diabetes sup - port group.20 Women tended to exhibit slightly slower but more sustained weight loss.21,22 There were also reductions in the use of diabetes medications, with some patients expe - riencing diabetes remission; improvements in symptoms of depression, urinary stress incontinence, sexual dysfunction, and sleep apnea; and protection from loss of mobility.12,23-27 Approaching obesity as a chronic disease is critical and is supported by the frequent observation that weight loss is commonly observed with treatment, but weight regain typically occurs once treatment ends.28 Furthermore, a sys - tematic review and meta-analysis found extended care to be effective in providing sustained weight loss.29 This article discusses multimodal approaches to obesity and its manage - ment as a chronic disease in women. ASSESSMENT AND CLASSIFICATION Assessment of risk posed by obesity is foundational to deter - mining intensity of treatment. In routine clinical practice, 2 surrogate measures are utilized to assess the degree of body fat before and during treatment: BMI and waist circumfer - ence. While BMI is based on height and weight, regardless of gender, and is an accurate measure of total body fat on a population basis, BMI overestimates body fat in individuals with edema and in those who are very muscular. Conversely, BMI underestimates body fat in those who have lost muscle mass (eg, elderly) or are limited in stature.8 Although the defi - nition of obesity and overweight are not standardized, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention define obesity in S16 FEBRUARY 2014 | Vol 63, No 2 | Supplement to The Journal of Family Practice S17 Supplement to The Journal of Family Practice | Vol 63, No 2 | FEBRUARY 2014 [OBESITY IN WOMEN] edge, skills, and self-efficacy, with support and coaching pro - vided by the health care team.30,37 Treatment of obesity requires a long-term, multimodal regimen consisting of behavior/nutrition therapy and increased physical activity, as the combination of the 2 is more effective than either alone.38 Pharmacotherapy can be used as an adjunct to diet and exercise. Because obesity is a chronic disease, medications should be considered only as part of a long-term treatment strategy.8 Surgery is an option for patients with BMI 40 kg/m2 or BMI 35 kg/m2and seri - ous comorbidities.8,39 Continued weight loss beyond 6 months is often diffi - cult due to changes in the metabolic rate and problems with adherence.8 When this occurs, treatment needs to be adjusted to recreate an energy deficit to allow the patient to continue to lose weight. Once further weight loss is not achievable, treat - ment should focus on weight maintenance and avoidance of weight regain. In practice, patients are advised to monitor weight frequently and if regain of 5 pounds or more occurs, then the same strategies that produced successful weight loss (eg, meal replacements, food diaries, exercise intensifica - tion) should be reinstituted. If the patient wishes to lose more weight after a period of weight maintenance, further therapy aimed at weight loss can be initiated.8 Finally, when managing other patient conditions, medi - cations that are associated with weight loss rather than weight gain should be used. For example, antidepressants that are associated with weight loss or are weight-neutral (bupropion, venlafaxine, or desvenlafaxine) may be better choices for treat - ment of depression than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (particularly citalopram, mirtazapine, and paroxetine) or tri - cyclic antidepressants, which are associated with weight gain. For T2DM, weight-neutral medications such as metformin or a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, or medications with a weight- lowering effect such as a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor ago - nist or sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor, are appropri - ate.40,41 For essential hypertension, older beta-blockers, such as atenolol, metoprolol, and propranolol, are more likely to cause weight gain than newer beta-blockers or other antihyperten - sives, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, which are weight-neutral. Behavior therapy Since obesity results from chronic caloric intake in excess of the body's needs, behavior modification related to nutrition and physical activity is essential. Changing behavior requires that the patient has the needed knowledge and skills for self- management and is motivated and ready to make the neces - sary changes. Motivational interviewing or transtheoretical model stages of change (see \"Assessment and Classification,\" page S16) can be used to help motivate patients to change and resolve feelings of ambivalence. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 38 trials involv - ing 13,495 individuals showed that behavioral interventions intended to address barriers to good nutrition and exercise hab - its resulted in an average weight loss of 4% over 12 to 18 months.17 A wide variety of interventions targeting behaviors to produce dietary caloric reduction and increased physical activity were employed, with some interventions delivered via telephone. Higher treatment intensity, consisting of self-monitoring, goal setting, more frequent follow-up, and making plans to address barriers to maintaining lifestyle changes over time, resulted in a 6% weight loss.17 In general, behavioral interventions were found to lead to less weight loss in women than in men. Self-monitoring involves the use of food diaries, physical activity logs, and weight records to enable patients to observe and record target behaviors to identify problematic patterns of behavior. Another behavior therapy approach is stimu - lus control, which involves patients avoiding cues that trigger unhealthy habits such as overeating and physical inactivity. Examples of stimulus control strategies include eating only at predetermined times; bringing lunch to work; placing sneak - ers at the door as a reminder to exercise; not buying or limit - ing access to unhealthy foods and beverages; and engaging in some activity immediately after eating to avoid dessert. Additional behavior therapies include cognitive restructuring (changing negative thought patterns), problem solving (pre - paring strategies to deal with challenging situations), and stress management.42 As shown by the Look AHEAD trial, when other tools such as meal replacements are added to higher intensity treatment approaches, weight loss can approach 9% at 1 year.20 Nutrition and physical activity Just as women are at greater risk for development of obesity and especially severe obesity, women are more likely to seek weight loss therapy. The clinical trials that evaluate nutrition and physical activity interventions regularly enroll a majority of par - ticipants who are women; it is not unusual for the participant population to be 80% female. Still, lacking evidence of gender differences in response to specific therapies, men and women generally receive the same intervention prescriptions. Achieving weight loss requires creating an energy deficit, while sustaining a reduced weight requires embedding the habits to sustain a new lifestyle. The usual strategy is to mod - ify behaviors that contribute to an unhealthy lifestyle and to build a series of new habits while successfully sustaining them. To avoid overwhelming the patient, not all new habits are implemented at once, but the \"build\" is to add subsequent habits. Successful implementation can build patient confi - dence and enhance motivation for more extensive changes. S18 FEBRUARY 2014 | Vol 63, No 2 | Supplement to The Journal of Family Practice [OBESITY IN WOMEN] Observations from the National Weight Control Registry (http://www.nwcr.ws/stories.htm) demonstrate that weight loss can be achieved with self-help methods and that while a variety of dietary paths can lead to successful weight loss, maintenance of that loss is associated with self-monitoring behaviors, good dietary habits (such as eating breakfast), and a physically active lifestyle over the long-term.43 Many types of diet approaches result in beneficial weight loss, regardless of the macronutrient featured or the dietary pattern, and none appear to have any long-term metabolic advantage over others in terms of weight loss.44 What is impor - tant is the creation of an energy deficit, whether it is by count - ing calories or avoiding classes of foods so as to restrict food choices, with resultant reduced caloric intake. The selection of diet composition can be influenced by patient preferences and the patient's health status. It is possible to lose weight with various diets, such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hyper - tension (DASH) diet for hypertension, a vegetarian diet, a low glycemic index diet, or the Mediterranean diet.45 Meal replace - ments (commercially available liquid, bar, or frozen entrees or snacks) can help in weight loss because they represent con - venient sources of nutrition and have known caloric content. When used as part of a comprehensive lifestyle intervention, meal replacements can produce enhanced weight loss com - pared with lifestyle counseling alone. Reports involving com - mercial weight loss programs, such as Jenny Craig, NutriSys - tem, Weight Watchers, and Slimming World, suggest similar success at achieving weight losses of 5% to 10% with no greater risks than other dietary approaches.46-51 Ultimately, the best diet is one that leads to weight loss and that the patient is able to adopt long-term to support weight maintenance. With respect to physical activity, the amount of weight lost due to exercise is generally small due to the difficulty most patients have in maintaining a moderate- or high-intensity level of physical activity.52 Still, the quantity of exercise can be a good predictor of success during a weight loss effort.53 Additionally, exercise can mitigate some of the health consequences of obe - sity.42 The American College of Sports Medicine recommends moderate-intensity physical activity 150 to 250 minutes/week, with an energy equivalent of 1200 to 2000 kcal/week. This level of physical activity is expected to prevent weight gain greater than 3% in most adults and may result in modest weight loss.52 Medications Medications are generally recommended as adjunctive therapy in patients with BMI 30 kg/m2 or BMI 27 kg/m2 with other risk factors or diseases. Except orlistat, which promotes malabsorp - tion of dietary fat, most weight loss medications promote sati - ety and reduce appetite. Medications can help more patients achieve clinically significant weight loss (>5%) and thus, be more likely to achieve health benefits. Medications can also be used to sustain weight loss. One principle of using weight loss medication is to use them only if they are effective. Efficacy for the medications approved for long-term use is generally based on achieving weight loss of at least 3% to 5% at 12 weeks. If this benchmark is not achieved, the dose of the medication should be increased, if appropriate, or the medication discontinued. Currently available medications for weight loss are indi - cated for short- or long-term use ( TABLE ). Those used for short-term use (ie, benzphetamine, diethylpropion, phen - dimetrazine, phentermine) are associated with modest weight loss.54-57 Their long-term use is not supported by clini - cal trials. In addition, state regulations generally limit their use to 3 months. Because of their sympathomimetic proper - ties, they are contraindicated in many disorders, such as car - diovascular disease (eg, hypertension, advanced arterioscle - rosis), hyperthyroidism, and glaucoma, during pregnancy or nursing, and in individuals with a history of drug abuse. The efficacy and safety of the 3 medications for long-term use (ie, lorcaserin, orlistat, phentermine/topiramate) have been demonstrated in randomized trials up to 2 or 4 years.3,4,58 In these trials, the majority of subjects were women; however, differences in outcomes between women and men were gen - erally not provided. A review of 12 trials found that orlistat combined with behavior therapy was associated with weight loss of 5 to 10 kg (8% of baseline body weight) over 12 months compared with 3 to 6 kg (5% of baseline body weight) with placebo and the same behavior therapy.17 Gastrointestinal adverse events were common, generally occurring early after the initiation of orlistat. Orlistat has been shown to be effective in helping maintain weight loss up to 4 years.59 Three clinical trials investigated lorcaserin in 6989 patients (79.0% female) over 1 year.60-62 In these trials, lorcaserin 10 mg twice daily resulted in a weight loss of 4.5% to 5.8% compared with 1.5% to 2.8% for placebo ( P < .001). More patients with lor - caserin lost 5% of their body weight compared with placebo (37.5% to 47.5% vs 16.1% to 25.0%, respectively; P < .001).60-62 From a baseline of 36 kg/m2, BMI decreased 2.1 kg/m2 in patients treated with lorcaserin and 0.8 to 1.0 kg/m2 in those treated with placebo; a similar reduction was seen in women and men.60,61 Waist circumferences decreased 6.3 to 6.8 cm with lorcaserin compared with 3.9 to 4.1 cm with placebo ( P < .001). A 4% to 6% improvement in triglycerides was observed, while improve - ments in other cardiovascular biomarkers were not consistently observed. Quality of life was also significantly improved.60,61 Adverse events included upper respiratory infections, head - ache, dizziness, nasopharyngitis, nausea, fatigue, and back pain. The combination of controlled-release phentermine/ topiramate has been investigated in two 56-week clinical trials involving 3754 patients (74.2% women) and a 52-week S19 Supplement to The Journal of Family Practice | Vol 63, No 2 | FEBRUARY 2014 [OBESITY IN WOMEN] extension trial.63-65 In one 56-week trial, patients BMI, the phentermine/topiramate 3.75/23 mg, phen and placebo groups lost 5.1%, 10.9%, and 1.6% of their baseline body weight, respectively.63 Weight loss 5% was observed in 44.9% and 66.7% of phenter - mine/topiramate patients, respectively, and 17.3% of placebo patients ( P < .0001). Waist circumference decreased 5.6%, 10.9%, < .0001). The phentermine/ topiramate 15/92 mg group had significantly greater improve - ment relative to placebo for systolic and diastolic BP , fasting glucose, triglycerides, total most were pares - thesia, dry mouth, constipation, dysgeusia, and insomnia. In the second 56-week trial, patients (baseline BMI, 36.6 kg/m2) in the phentermine/topiramate 7.5/46 mg and phentermine/topiramate 15/92 mg groups lost 7.8% and 9.8% of their body weight, respectively, compared with 1.2% for placebo ( P < .0001).64 Waist circumference decreased 7.6%, 9.2%, and 2.4%, respectively ( P < .0001). In patients treated with phentermine/topiramate, significant improvements were observed in systolic and diastolic BP , fasting glucose, gly - cated hemoglobin, triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL-C, and HDL-C. Adverse events were similar to those in the other 56-week trial, although depression- and anxiety-related adverse events were observed in a small proportion. Similar efficacy results were observed in those who continued for an additional 52 weeks (N = 676).65 The rates of adverse events were generally reduced compared with rates in the 56-week phase. SUMMARY Obesity is a common disorder affecting approximately 1 in 3 women. Assessment should consist of measuring BMI and waist circumference, a thorough history regarding nutri -tion, physical activity, and prior attempts at weight loss, and identification of obesity-related comorbidities. As a chronic disease, obesity requires management using a chronic care model employing multimodal therapy. Behavioral therapy to bring about changes in nutrition and physical activity can be supplemented with long-term use of medications (lorcase - rin, orlistat, phentermine/topiramate) to help patients both achieve and maintain meaningful weight loss. l REFERENCES 1.

Among the factors to consider, patient gender is essential since there are signifi - cant differences between women and men with T2DM. One obvious difference is that women can develop gestational diabetes. Other differences between men and women with T2DM are the focus of this article, including risk factors for developing T2DM, cardiovascular and other complications, and treatment [for a focus on diabetes in men, see: Aguilar R. J Fam Pract. 2012;61(6):S16-S21]. KEY RISK FACTORS FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS IN WOMEN Working with women to prevent the development of T2DM is an important objective for primary care clinicians. Women identified at increased risk of T2DM, especially those with prediabetes, should be educated about the disease and its risk factors, particularly modifiable risk factors such as increased body weight, lack of physical activity, elevated blood pressure (BP), elevated blood lipids, impaired glucose tolerance, and smoking. Women with nonmodifiable risk factors, such as a family history of diabetes mellitus, those who delivered a baby weighing more than 9 pounds, or those with a history of gesta - tional diabetes, should also be educated. 1 Women with risk factors that pose a greater risk for T2DM compared with men are especially important targets for edu - cation. One of these risk factors is the triglyceride level. A recent analysis of 2523 adults showed that the relative risk (RR) Penny Tenzer-Iglesias, MD, FAAFP, Associate Professor of Clinical Family Medicine, Department of Family Medicine and Community Health, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine; Chief of Service, Department of Family Medicine, University of Miami Hospital, Miami, FL DISCLOSURES Dr. Tenzer-Iglesias discloses that she has no real or apparent conflicts of interest to report. SUPPORT This article is sponsored by PCEC and is supported by funding from Novo Nordisk, Inc.for T2DM in those with a triglyceride level in the 90% quantile (202 mg/dL for women vs 334 mg/dL for men) was higher in women than in men (4.4 vs 2.8, respectively). 2 Dyslipidemia (low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], high total cholesterol, and high triglyceride level) has been shown to be significantly associated with occupational stress, particularly in women (odds ratio [OR], 1.54 vs 1.31 in men). 3 In fact, the association of occupational stress with T2DM is stronger in women than in men (OR, 2.4 in women, 1.21 in men). The Monitoring of Trends and Determinants in Car - diovascular Disease Augsburg (MONICA) surveys involving 85 women and 128 men identified that physical inactiv - ity (during leisure time) was an independent risk factor for T2DM in women (hazard ratio [HR], 1.80). 4 Physical inactiv - ity was identified as spending less than 1 hour per week in a sports activity during summer or winter. Subsequent mul - tivariate analysis of a larger cohort of the MONICA surveys (N = 527 adults with T2DM) showed that the inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were significantly associated with an increased risk of T2DM in women but not in men. 5 For example, comparing tertile extremes for CRP , an HR of 7.60 was observed in women compared with 1.84 in men ( P < .001). A prospective Finnish study also showed a significantly higher risk of T2DM with increased CRP in women compared with men ( c 2 = 6.42; P < .025).6 Since CRP and adiposity were more strongly asso - ciated in women than in men, adiposity-related inflamma - tion may play a greater role in the development of insulin resistance in women. The MONICA surveys also showed an association between high alcohol intake and increased risk of T2DM in men but not in women. 4 This is in contrast to other studies that showed that moderate alcohol consumption reduced the risk of T2DM in women. 7,8 During a median follow-up of 10.3 years, Joosten et al7 showed that, compared with women who had consumed no alcohol during their lifetimes, HRs for T2DM were 0.75 for light (0-4.9 g/d) and former drinkers, 0.48 for moderate (5.0-14.9 g/d) drinkers, and 0.54 for heavy (15.0 g/d) drinkers. A U-shaped relationship between alco - hol consumption and T2DM risk reduction was demonstrated by Baliunas et al 8 in a meta-analysis of 20 cohort studies. For S21 Supplement to The Journal of Family Practice | Vol 63, No 2 | FEBR uaRy 2014S22 [TYPE 2 DIABETES IN WOMEN] women, alcohol consumption of 24 g/day was most protec - tive, but became harmful at about 50 g/day. The benefits of alcohol consumption in healthy women and men have been linked to lower levels of CRP , IL-6, and soluble tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptors 1 and 2. 9 Links to improved insulin sen - sitivity, lower basal insulin secretion, and lower fasting plasma glucagon level in healthy women have also been made. 10 These investigations suggest that risk factors for T2DM in women, in addition to those widely recognized (eg, weight, race, family history, and fat distribution), include an elevated triglyceride level and physical inactivity, as well as occupa - tional stress and inflammatory markers (eg, CRP and IL-6). On the other hand, moderate alcohol (5-14.9 g/d) consump - tion may offer a protective benefit. The clinical utility of these data remains unclear and should be cautiously applied in providing individualized patient care. Implications for treatment Preventing or reducing the risk of T2DM onset is an impor - tant treatment goal. Several trials have shown a 34% to 43% reduction at 7 to 20 years in the rate of conversion from impaired glucose tolerance to T2DM with lifestyle interven - tion. 11-13 Furthermore, augmenting lifestyle intervention with stress management strategies has been shown to contribute to greater weight loss at 3 months in women with moderate to high stress levels at baseline. 14 Although no drug is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for prediabetes, metformin, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, and thiazolidin - ediones have demonstrated an ability to decrease T2DM onset to varying degrees in both men and women. 1 Issues related to the lack of continued benefit, adverse events, and cost led the American Diabetes Association/European Asso - ciation for the Study of Diabetes (ADA/EASD) consensus panel to recommend metformin as the only drug for phar - macologic intervention. 15 Appropriate candidates for met - formin intervention include those with impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, or glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c) 5.7% to 6.4%. This is particularly true if, in addition, a patient has a body mass index >35 kg/m2, age <60 years, or prior gestational diabetes mellitus.1 By contrast, the more recent comprehensive algorithm developed by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists recommends met - formin, noted in ADA/EASD 2012 consensus recommen - dations, the GLP-1R agonists have demonstrated improve - ment in 1 or more measures of pancreatic b-cell mass and function.15,17-20 After 52 weeks, exenatide has shown sig - nificant improvement in the first- and second-phase insu - lin response. At 3 years, the glucose-stimulated C-peptide response was significantly lower in the exenatide group com - pared with the glargine group.17 In a 26-week trial, both exena - tide and liraglutide improved b-cell function as assessed by the homeostasis model of assessment- b (HOMA-B) (2.74% vs 32.12%, respectively).19 a 14-week extension, those switching from exenatide to liraglutide experienced an additional 14.5% increase in HOMA-B. 20 Since pancre - atic b-cell dysfunction is a key pathogenic mechanism in T2DM, this potential benefit of the GLP-1R agonists may be an important consideration in managing women, as well as men, at risk for T2DM. RISK OF COMPLICATIONS IN WOMEN WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS Once diagnosed with T2DM, treatment that targets blood glucose, BP , and lipids and includes antiplatelet therapy, smoking cessation, proper nutrition, exercise, and screen - ing for microvascular and macrovascular disease is essential for all patients. Targeting hypertriglyceridemia and physical inactivity can be particularly helpful in women. The selec - tion and implementation of these strategies should take into account the psychosocial and coping behaviors of women. Risk for cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus Women with T2DM compared with men with T2DM are at greater risk of a cardiovascular event. One investigation involving 4.7 years of follow-up showed that women were 8 times more likely than men to experience a composite end - point of death, acute myocardial infarction (MI), unstable angina, coronary intervention, heart failure, cerebral isch - emic stroke or transient ischemic attack, or peripheral artery disease ( P < .009). 21 Similar findings were observed from anal - ysis of the General Practice Research Database that included more than 42,000 women and men with T2DM. 22 The stroke rate per 1000 person-years across all ages was 13.16 (95% confidence interval [CI], 12.40-13.97) in women and 10.82 (95% CI, 10.17-11.51) in men. The rate of stroke was gener - ally lower in women than in men with T2DM aged <75 years (except those aged 45-54 years), but higher than in men aged 75 years. However, in both women and men, the risk for stroke in those with diabetes compared with those without diabetes was inversely associated with age, with the greatest risk in women 35 to 54 years old with diabetes (HR compared with no diabetes: 8.18 for women, 4.66 for men). No cause for the increased risk for stroke in people with diabetes com - pared with those without diabetes could be identified. The metabolic syndrome is a stronger predictor of coronary heart disease (CHD) in women than in men. 23,24 Data over 6 to 8 years from the Nurses' Health Study S22 FEBR uaRy 2014 | Vol 63, No 2 | Supplement to The Journal of Family Practice S23 Supplement to The Journal of Family Practice | Vol 63, No 2 | FEBR uaRy 2014 [TYPE 2 DIABETES IN WOMEN] (N = 30, 111 women) and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (N = 16,695 men) show that the RR of CHD in individuals with the metabolic syndrome compared with those without the metabolic syndrome was higher in women than in men (RR, 3.01 vs 1.62, respectively; P = .03). 23 Furthermore, women with T2DM typically have a worse prognosis than men with T2DM after MI and a higher risk of death overall from CHD. 24 Another meta-analysis of 29 stud - ies showed that the RR of fatal MI in women with T2DM com - pared with men with T2DM was 1.46.25 The Skaraborg Project, which involved 1116 Swed - ish patients with hypertension and/or T2DM, provided similar findings. 26 Over 8.1 years of follow-up, the age- adjusted HR for fatal MI was 5.0 for women with T2DM vs women without T2DM and 1.9 for men with T2DM vs men without T2DM. Analysis of data from the National Health Interview Survey showed that, despite a 40% decline in car - diovascular death and a 23% decline in all-cause mortality in patients with diabetes from 1997-1998 to 2003-2004, the dif - ferences in cardiovascular outcomes between women and men with diabetes remained unchanged. 27 Several reasons have been identified for the worse out - comes in women with T2DM. These include a more severe form of dyslipidemia and a higher prevalence of obesity in women compared with men with T2DM. 24,28 The Italian Dia - betes and Informatics Study Group found that high triglyc - eride levels, low HDL-C levels, and microangiopathy were important risk factors for CHD in women, whereas glycemic control and hypertension were key risk factors in men with T2DM. 29 However, analysis of the Sibutramine Cardiovas - cular OUTcomes (SCOUT) trial, which included 7479 over - weight or obese patients with T2DM and/or cardiovascular disease, found that for each 1% increase in the HbA 1c level, all-cause mortality increased 22% in women and 12% in men (P = .02).30 Postprandial hyperglycemia, particularly after lunch, was found to be a greater risk factor for cardiovascular events (eg, MI, angina, lower limb ischemia-related amputa - tion, any revascularization procedure) than fasting hypergly - cemia in women with T2DM. 31 Given the ongoing difference in outcomes and com - pounding risk factors for women with T2DM, clinicians should consider an aggressive education and management approach toward all risk factors (ie, physical inactivity, obe - sity, hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL-C, hypertension, and postprandial hyperglycemia) and comorbid diseases that affect mortality, morbidity, or quality of life. Implications for treatment Metformin, sulfonylureas, and insulin have all demonstrated microvascular risk reduction.16 With respect to the thiazoli - dinediones, pioglitazone may have a modest benefit on car - diovascular events, while rosiglitazone is associated with an increased risk of MI. The GLP-1R agonists, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, colesevelam, and bromocriptine have all reported ben - eficial effects on cardiovascular biomarkers, such as BP and/or the lipid profile. The GLP-1R agonists lower sys - tolic but not diastolic BP 1 to 7 mm Hg. 19,20,32-34 In addition, improvements in the lipid profile are observed, particularly in the triglyceride level, where a reduction of 12 to 40 mg/dL has been reported. 18,19,32,34,35 Over a mean of 3.3 years, a car - diovascular event was observed in 2.2% of patients with impaired glucose tolerance treated with acarbose compared with 4.7% treated with placebo (HR, 0.51; P = .03). 36 The ef- fects of colesevelam on the lipid profile generally show a reduction in total cholesterol, but an increase in the triglyc - eride level. 37 Bromocriptine has been reported to reduce car - diovascular risk (composite of first MI, stroke, coronary revas - cularization, or hospitalization for angina or congestive heart failure) compared with placebo (1.8% vs 3.2%, respectively). 38 Sexual and urological issues in women with diabetes As with men, women with T2DM develop sexual and uro- logic complications more frequently than people without T2DM. In addition to directly causing damage to nerves and small blood vessels, diabetes can also lead to sexual prob-lems by contributing to psychosocial comorbidities such as anxiety or depression. 39 Sexual problems, which have been reported in 42% of women with T2DM, may include vagi-nal dryness, diminished or lack of desire for sexual activity, and decreased or absent sexual response. Vaginal lubri-cants to alleviate dyspareunia secondary to dryness and counseling regarding techniques and exercises to improve sexual functioning and response may be helpful. Diabetes also leads to urologic problems in more than half of women with diabetes, including urinary tract infections, overac - tive bladder, poor control of sphincter muscles, and urinary retention. 39 Since urologic problems other than urinary tract infections generally evolve over time, patients may be relatively unaware of a urologic problem or may have come to accept it. Rather than simply asking, \"Do you have any problems urinating?\" , asking specific questions is more likely to uncover a woman's urologic problems. Examples of these types of questions include \"When you have the urge to urinate, do you feel the need to urinate immediately?\" \"Do you ever leak urine?\" \"How often do you urinate during the night?\" These responses may be used to guide subsequent therapy, as appropriate.S24 FEBR uaRy 2014 | Vol 63, No 2 | Supplement to The Journal of Family Practice [TYPE 2 DIABETES IN WOMEN] PSYCHOSOCIAL WELL-BEING, BENEFITS OF SELF-CARE, AND COPING STRATEGIES There are important differences between women and men with T2DM regarding their attitudes and beliefs about the disease ( Table 1 ).40-47 Several investigators, including the MONICA surveys, found that women with T2DM are signifi - cantly less likely than men to participate in leisure time phys - ical activity and other forms of exercise.4,5,48 Among women who exercise, walking was the most common form of physi - cal activity. Factors that may contribute to physical inactiv - ity include lower socioeconomic status and depression.48,49 In addition to the impact of occupational stress as described above, psychological distress may also play an important role as women with T2DM and type D personality (high negative affectivity and social inhibition) report a more sedentary life - style. 50 In patients with type 1 diabetes, fear of hypoglycemia is an important cause of physical inactivity, with fear of hypo - glycemia directly associated with the number of severe hypo - glycemic episodes in the previous year.51 Understanding these gender differences and modifying how diabetes care is provided to women vs men is particularly important for patients with T2DM, since glycemic control is largely determined by patient self-management. 52 Thus, indi - TABLE 1 Psychosocial and coping characteristics of women with type 2 diabetes mellitus40-47 Compared with men with T2DM, women with T2DM generally: Experience more diabetes-related distress and a poorer sense of well-being Rate their health-related quality of life higher Are more likely to experience symptoms of depression Experience a more rapid deterioration in physical function Exercise less Have higher expectations regarding the benefits of self-management Are more informed about T2DM, particularly pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment options Exert more effort and employ more strategies to cope with T2DM, particularly religion, active coping, and distraction Have greater adaptive attitudes toward T2DM Are influenced less by symptoms of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia Visit a physician more frequently Perceive more support from their health care team and are influenced more by their physician Believe they have little family and social support and are minimally influenced by such support Abbreviation: T2DM, type 2 diabetes mellitus. vidualizing care to provide psychological and social support as well as counseling regarding exercise and physical activity would seem to be especially important in managing women with T2DM. 40 In fact, women who had participated in diabe - tes self-management education (DSME) were significantly more likely than those who had not participated in DSME to participate in moderate physical activity as well as to check their blood glucose and examine their feet regularly. 53 Implications for treatment Improving the quality of life of a woman with T2DM should be considered an important treatment goal ( Table 2 ). Beyond involving the woman in goal setting and decision making, providing psychological and social support and DSME are recommended as important steps to improve quality of life. Barriers to physical activity and their possible solutions, as well as the possibility of depression and occupational stress as contributing factors, should be discussed. Factors beyond physical activity that might contribute to obesity, such as poor dietary habits, should be investigated. In addition, addressing barriers and concerns with pharmacologic ther - TABLE 2 Suggestions for women at risk for or diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitusa For women who are at risk Key targets - Triglyceride level - Smoking cessation Promote healthy diet, increased activity level For women who have been diagnosed Key targets - Blood glucose, particularly postprandial glucose- Triglyceride level Emphasize lifestyle management to promote weight loss and increase activity level Emphasize the importance of self-management Provide ongoing education/information regarding the progres - sive nature of type 2 diabetes mellitus and the need to adjust treatment over time, potentially adding both oral and injectable therapies Counsel on possible hormonal influences on blood glucose Assess for sexual and urologic complications Assess for psychological distress, anxiety, depression, and occupational stress; manage as appropriate Assess for early diabetes-related complications Recommend a diabetes support group aThese suggestions are in addition to a collaborative, patient-centered approach.S25 Supplement to The Journal of Family Practice | Vol 63, No 2 | FEBR uaRy 2014 [TYPE 2 DIABETES IN WOMEN] apy, such as weight gain and fear of hypoglycemia, can lead to significant improvements in patient quality of life.54-57 The as thiazolidinediones, are recommended options when the goal is to avoid hypoglycemia. 58 Similarly, the GLP-1R agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors are recommended options when the goal is to avoid weight gain. 58 SUMMARY Women and men with T2DM share many of the same risks and challenges in managing their disease, yet there are important differences between the genders that have been highlighted in this article. Understanding and applying the knowledge of these differences in clinical practice is essen - tial to assist women with T2DM so as to improve their dia - betes self-management, function, quality of life, and clinical outcomes. Of course, as with men, prevention of diabetes remains an important management objective. l Refe Rences 1. American Diabetes Association. Standards of medical care in diabetes\u20142012.

For example, severe morning stiffness early in the course of RA has a high impact on patients' decisions to retire from working. 1 Furthermore, joint damage begins early in the course of RA and is largely irreversible.2 While early diagnosis and initiation of recommended therapy is impor - tant, only one-quarter to one-half of patients with RA receive appropriate therapy. 3,4 Women are more likely to be afflicted with RA and to experience more severe disease with worse disability and pain compared with men. 5,6 In addition, young women, but not young men, with RA have an increased risk of bone fractures. 7 This article highlights the early management of patients with RA, emphasizing the criteria and need for diagnosis and pharmacologic management of early RA.

CONTEMPORARY MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS WITH EARLY RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS Paradigmatic changes in therapeutic approaches to patients with RA have occurred in recent years due to recognition that even early disease activity negatively impacts function and causes irreversible joint damage. 8 In addition, it is established that early initiation of disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy is associated with a greater likelihood of Gary Ruoff, MD, Clinical Professor of Family Medicine, Department of Family Practice, Michigan State University College of Medicine; Director of Clinical Research, Westside Family Medical Center, Kalamazoo, MI DISCLOSURES Dr. Ruoff discloses that he has no real or apparent conflicts of inter - est to report.

Consequently, the anticitrulli-nated protein antibody (ACPA) test has become more useful in clinical practice. When there is diagnostic doubt, conventional radiogra - phy, ultrasound, or magnetic resonance imaging can be used to improve the certainty of a diagnosis of RA above clinical criteria alone. 19 Imaging of the joints using conventional radi - ography has been the gold standard in RA, but its sensitivity for identifying structural damage is low and it does not allow assessment of disease activity. Recommendations for the use of imaging of joints in the clinical management of RA were recently developed; those related to the diagnosis of RA are presented in Table 2 .19 Pharmacologic management of early rheumatoid arthritis The goal of therapy for patients with RA is remission or, at the very least, low disease activity, so as to maximize long-term health-related quality of life through control of symp - S27 Supplement to The Journal of Family Practice | Vol 63, No 2 | FEBRUARY 2014S28 [RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS] toms, prevention of structural damage, and normalization of function and social participation.2,20 Determining the goal of therapy should be a shared decision between pro-vider and patient based on patient considerations, such as comorbidities and preferences. To achieve the goal, therapy should be directed at abrogation of inflammation by initiat - ing DMARD therapy\u2014as compared to analgesic therapy\u2014as early as possible in the disease course, ideally at the time of diagnosis. For patients with early RA (disease duration <6 months) and low disease activity or moderate to high disease activ - ity without poor prognostic features, synthetic DMARD monotherapy is recommended. 2 Poor prognostic features include functional disease, azathioprine, sulfasalazine, gold), methotrexate is used most frequently because of its efficacy, both as monotherapy and in combination with bio - logical DMARDs, as well as its good long-term safety profile. 21 Patient response should be assessed by measuring disease activity, with treatment modified as needed, using a treat-to-target approach. This approach has been shown to provide clinical benefits compared with routine care in patients with early RA. 8,20 The treat-to-target approach for RA embraces the same principles as for diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, wherein therapy is initiated to achieve the target goal within several months and therapy is modified as needed to maintain the target goal.

S28 FEBRUARY 2014 | Vol 63, No 2 | Supplement to The Journal of Family Practice S29 Supplement to The Journal of Family Practice | Vol 63, No 2 | FEBRUARY 2014 [RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS] Role of corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs in early rheumatoid arthritis While DMARD therapy is discussed extensively in the 2012 ACR RA guidelines, there is little mention of corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), except that the use of intraarticular and oral corticosteroids and NSAIDs \"may be important components of RA treatment. \" 2 The 2010 EULAR recommendations are somewhat more descriptive, noting that adding a corticosteroid \"at low to moderately high doses to synthetic DMARD monotherapy (or combinations of synthetic DMARDs) provides benefit as initial short-term management, but should be tapered as rapidly as clinically feasible. \" 21 Another role for low-dose cor - ticosteroid or NSAID therapy in primary care might be to pro - vide short-term pain relief prior to establishing a diagnosis of RA or while awaiting referral to a rheumatologist. A concern with corticosteroid and NSAID therapy is the gastrointestinal and other adverse events associated with their use. 21,22 Three new products intended to address this concern have recently been approved by the FDA. Two combine a fixed-dose of an NSAID with either esomepra-zole (naproxen/esomeprazole [Vimovo]) or famotidine (ibuprofen/famotidine [Duexis]) to prevent the occurrence of ulcers and to improve adherence over combined use of TABLE 2 Recommendations for imaging to aid in the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis19 The presence of inflammation seen with ultrasound or MRI can be used to predict the progression to clinical RA from undifferenti - ated inflammatory arthritis. Ultrasound and MRI are superior to clinical examination in the detection of joint inflammation; these techniques should be con - sidered for more accurate assessment of inflammation. CR of the hands and feet should be used as the initial imaging technique to detect damage. However, ultrasound and/or MRI should be considered if CR does not show damage and may be used to detect damage at an earlier time point (especially in early RA). MRI bone edema is a strong independent predictor of sub - sequent radiographic progression in early RA and should be considered for use as a prognostic indicator. Joint inflammation (synovitis) detected by MRI or ultrasound as well as joint damage detected by CR, MRI, or ultrasound can also be considered for the prediction of further joint damage. Inflammation seen on imaging may be more predictive of a thera - peutic response than clinical features of disease activity; imaging may be used to predict response to treatment.

The third product is a delayed-release prednisone (Rayos) to be taken at bedtime, with prednisone released during the early morning hours to better coincide with the circadian rhythms of endogenous cortisol and symptoms of RA, both of which peak during the early morn-ing hours. 23 All 3 products are more expensive than generic formulations. Naproxen/esomeprazole The safety of the fixed-dose combination of enteric-coated naproxen 500 mg and immediate-release esomeprazole magnesium 20 mg has been evaluated for 6 to 12 months in patients with RA, osteoarthritis, or some other condi - tion requiring daily NSAIDs. 24,25 In two 6-month studies, the cumulative incidence of endoscopically-proven gastric ulcers was 4.1% to 7.1% with naproxen/esomeprazole, com - pared with 23.1% to 24.3% with enteric-coated naproxen (P < .001). 24 Dyspepsia occurred in 16.5% to 19.5% and 23.3% to 30.1% of patients, respectively. In the 12-month study, 18.8% of patients treated with naproxen/esomeprazole expe - rienced an upper gastrointestinal adverse event, primarily dyspepsia. 25 Ibuprofen/famotidine The REDUCE-1 and REDUCE-2 studies compared the safety of ibuprofen 800 mg with the fixed-dose combina - tion of ibuprofen 800 mg and famotidine 26.6 mg 3 times daily for 24 weeks in patients with no evidence of ulcers who required daily NSAID therapy; two-thirds of the patients were women. 26,27 An endoscopically-proven gastric or duo - denal ulcer was observed in 26.9% of ibuprofen patients and of ibuprofen/famotidine patients ( P < .05) in REDUCE-1 (N = 904) and in 20.5% and 13.0% of patients, respectively ( P = NS), in REDUCE-2 (N = 627). 26 Pooled results of the studies showed that the risk of a gastric or duo - denal ulcer was reduced 48% with ibuprofen/famotidine. In addition, dyspepsia occurred in 8.0% of patients treated with ibuprofen and 4.7% of patients treated with ibupro - fen/famotidine, while nausea occurred in 4.7% and 5.8% of patients, respectively. Delayed-release prednisone The efficacy and safety of delayed-release prednisone have been evaluated in the CAPRA-1 and CAPRA-2 randomized, double-blind trials of patients with RA. In CAPRA-2, the addition of delayed-release prednisone 5 mg to DMARD therapy at dinnertime for 12 weeks resulted in significantly greater improvements in RA signs and symptoms than pla - cebo, according to ACR criteria. 28 In CAPRA-1, patients took delayed-release prednisone between 9:30 pm and 10:30 pm S30 FEBRUARY 2014 | Vol 63, No 2 | Supplement to The Journal of Family Practice [RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS] or immediate-release prednisone between 6 am and 8 am for 12 weeks.23 Patients continued the same dose of predni - sone taken at baseline (rounded to a full milligram; mean 6.5 vs 6.7 mg/day, respectively), as well as other DMARD and NSAID therapy. At study end, morning stiffness was reduced 44 minutes (baseline 156 minutes) in the delayed-release group compared with 23 minutes (baseline 182 min - utes) in the immediate-release group ( P = .072). The safety profile did not differ between the 2 groups. Patients contin - ued on or were switched to delayed-release prednisone in a 9-month open-label extension. 29 Over the 12 months of treat - ment, the mean morning stiffness decreased 83 minutes in the delayed-release group and 88 minutes in the immediate-release/delayed-release group. Treatment-related adverse events observed in >1.0% of the total study population were weight increase (2.4%), gastritis (1.6%), and upper abdominal pain (1.2%). Additional investigation has shown significant improvement in health-related quality of life and reduced need for biological DMARD therapy over 9 months in patients with long-standing RA. 30 The cost-effectiveness of delayed- release prednisone has yet to be compared with immediate-release prednisone. SUMMARY The family physician plays several important roles in the management of patients with RA by early diagnosis of RA, with initiation of synthetic DMARD therapy, and in long-term follow-up to minimize complications of DMARD therapy and its impact on patient comorbidities.

Niebyl, MD and Gerald G. Briggs, BPharm, FCCP INTRODUCTION Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) is widely recog - nized as a common complication and occurs in 44% to 89% of pregnant women.1 NVP usually begins between 4 and 6 weeks of gestation, peaks between 8 and 12 weeks, and resolves by 16 to 20 weeks in the majority of women. 1 Contin - uation beyond 20 weeks is generally thought to occur in 5% to 10% of women. However, recent evidence suggests that 29% to 45% of women experience NVP during late pregnancy, suggesting that inquiry about NVP should be made through - out a woman's pregnancy. 1,2 Despite the high prevalence, undertreatment of NVP has been common in the United States, likely due to the beliefs that NVP is a natural part of pregnancy and that there is no need for concern unless there are signs or symptoms related to NVP in its most severe form, ie, hyperemesis gravidarum. 3 Hyperemesis gravidarum is typically characterized by per - sistent nausea and vomiting with or without retching, >5% weight loss, hypokalemia, high urine specific gravity due to dehydration, and ketonuria. 4 Other factors contributing to the undertreatment of NVP include fear of fetal harm caused by medications and, until recently, the lack of available pre - Jennifer R.

NVP can also lead to increased costs and utilization of health care resources. 5-10 While concerns about harm to the fetus due to medications are justified, many medications commonly used to treat NVP are not known to pose additional fetal risk. 11 Furthermore, initiating treat - ment at the recognition of pregnancy, before the occurrence of symptoms of NVP in women at high risk for recurrence of severe NVP , is superior to initiating treatment following the onset of symptoms. 12 Addressing these issues in the primary care management of the pregnant woman with nausea and vomiting is the focus of this article. AssessMeNT Common symptoms associated with NVP include any combi - nation of nausea, gagging, retching, dry heaving, vomiting, and odor and/or food aversion. 4 Since a focus of the assessment is to determine if the nausea and vomiting are due to the preg - nancy or some other cause, the patient should be questioned about the onset, timing, severity, aggravating and alleviating factors, and appearance of the vomitus, as this can help to rule out causes other than pregnancy. Onset of nausea beyond 8 weeks after the last menstrual period is rare in pregnancy. 13 NVP is often triggered by 1 or more factors, such as motion, heartburn, and food or other odors. The vomitus in NVP is usually nonbilious and nonbloody. 14 The patient his - tory should include questions concerning fever, abdominal pain, and change in bowel habits; headache, neck stiffness, and changes in vision may suggest a neurological cause. 14 Non -pregnancy-related causes of persistent vomiting include gastrointestinal disorders (eg, appendicitis, hepatitis, pancreatitis, biliary disorders such as diabetic ketoacidosis, porphyria, or Addi - son disease, and central nervous system diseases such as migraine, infections, tumors, and seizures. 13,14 When a cause other than pregnancy is suspected, laboratory testing should S31 Supplement to The Journal of Family Practice | Vol 63, No 2 | FEBR uaRy 2014S32 [management of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy] generally assess urinary ketones, blood Complications of NVP should be investigated as well, particularly in women who experience severe, persistent vomiting. Possible compli - cations include dehydration or thiamine deficiency resulting in Wernicke encephalopathy, which can occur after 3 weeks of persistent vomiting. The Pregnancy-Unique Quantification of Emesis (PUQE) score can be used to assess the severity of NVP , as well as to follow the response to treatment and improvement over time. 4 Both 12- and 24-hour scoring systems have been validated; the 24-hour system accounts for time sleeping and the severity of symptoms through the first trimester. 15 Finally, the assessment should also include inquiry about treatments that have already been attempted by the patient to self-manage NVP . These include not only lifestyle and dietary changes, but also vitamins and complementary or alternative therapies. TReATMeNT Variation in the symptoms of NVP and the impact they have on pregnant women and their families requires that treat - ment be individualized to achieve the following goals: 1) reduce the incidence, severity, and impact of symptoms; 2) reduce the risk of progression to more severe NVP; 3) correct the consequences or complications, including fluid/electro - lyte imbalance and metabolic alkalosis; and 4) minimize the effects on the fetus, particularly the effects of treatment. To achieve these goals, nonpharmacologic therapies, followed by pharmacologic therapies if necessary, can be employed. Nonpharmacologic and alternative therapies A mainstay of treatment for NVP involves dietary and lifestyle approaches. Women should be advised to avoid factors that trigger nausea, including strong odors, fatty or spicy foods, and iron tablets. 13 Clinical experience indicates that avoid - ing an empty stomach by eating small meals consisting of bland, dry, high-protein food every 1 to 2 hours and drinking room-temperature fluids between meals (rather than with meals) may be helpful. 13,16,17 Dietary guidelines developed by the Motherisk NVP group at Toronto's Hospital for Sick Chil - dren are summarized in Table 1 .15 Beyond dietary factors, adequate sleep is also important. Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) and ginger are often used by patients prior to seeking medical care and have been shown to be safe and effective for NVP . 11 Pyridoxine is typically used in daily doses of 50 to 100 mg, although daily doses as high as 500 mg have been used. 18-21 Ginger is also effective in daily doses of 500 to 1000 mg, with reflux and heartburn the most common side effects.13,22-25 A comparison of pyridoxine and ginger found ginger 1000 mg/day to be more effective than pyridoxine 40 mg/day for 4 days for reducing the severity of nausea. Both were similarly effective for decreasing the num - ber of vomiting episodes in early pregnancy. 26 Weak evidence indicates that acupressure may be effec - tive for NVP .27 Acupressure stimulation of the peri - cardium 6 (P6) acupoint, located 4.5 cm above the wrist on the inside of the forearm. 16,28-31 Stimulation is provided by wrist bands, with some emitting a weak electrical current. PrimaBella, formerly the ReliefBand, has been shown to be effective and is the only device approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for NVP . 32,33 Pharmacologic treatment A wide variety of pharmacologic options have been uti-lized for the management of NVP ( Table 2 ).11,34-39 Efficacy and safety are 2 key considerations in selecting treatment. A recent systematic, evidence-based review examined ran-domized controlled trials of any intervention for NVP. 27 Excluded were trials using a crossover design or those involving women with hyperemesis gravidarum. Twenty-seven trials of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treat - ment involving 4041 women were included. Due to the lack of high-quality evidence, the Cochrane investigators found limited evidence to support the use of pharmacologic anti-emetic agents in early pregnancy. In contrast, the American TABLE 1 Dietary guidelines for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy15 Republished with permission of Dovepress, from International Journal of Women's Health; Ebrahimi N, Maltepe C, Einarson A.

First, there is the inherent problem of ethi - cally conducting trials in pregnant women to assess medica - tion safety in humans. Thus, safety is often inferred from ani - mal studies. For older medications, such as antihistamines and some phenothiazines, there is no FDA pregnancy rating ( Table 2 ).34-39 Second, the risk of having a baby with a birth defect by chance alone is 1% to 3%.41 Meta-analyses and epi - demiologic studies have not found a higher incidence of birth defects with antihistamines (H 1-receptor blockers), pheno - thiazines, and metoclopramide.42-46 A marginally increased risk of major malformations following first-trimester expo - sure to corticosteroids has been observed.47 In addition, the same study found an increased risk (odds ratio, 3.35) of oral cleft. An increased risk of hypospadias (odds ratio, 2.87) with corticosteroid use during the first trimester has also been identified from an analysis of data from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study. 48 These findings indicate that cor - ticosteroids should be reserved for NVP refractory to other treatments until after the first trimester of pregnancy. Doxylamine/pyridoxine Bendectin, the combination of doxylamine and pyridoxine (also in combination with dicyclomine until 1978), was used as an antiemetic by more than 33 million pregnant women in the United States and throughout the world for nearly TABLE 2 Fetal safety of pharmacologic agents used to treat nausea and vomiting of pregnancy Pharmacologic class/agentRisk classification FDA risk Corticosteroid PrednisoneC 39Human data suggest risk; avoid during first 10 weeks of gestation Abbreviation: FDA, US Food and Drug Administration. aFDA risk factor definitions: A: adequate and well-controlled human studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus in the first trimester of pregnancy (and there is no evidence of risk in later trimesters) B: Animal reproduction studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women OR animal stud- ies have shown an adverse effect, but adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus in any trimester C: Animal reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect on the fetus and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans, but potential benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks. bDefinitions from Drugs in Pregnancy and Lactation, 9th ed. by Briggs, Freeman, and Yaffe: Compatible: Human pregnancy experience is adequate to demonstrate that the embryo-fetal risk is very low or nonexistent.

In the late 1970s, published studies began to appear that raised the possibility of an association of doxyl - amine/pyridoxine with birth defects. In-depth review by the FDA and regulatory agencies throughout the world found no association between doxylamine/pyridoxine and birth defects. Nonetheless, allegations continued and litigation mounted, causing the principal manufacturer to remove doxylamine/pyridoxine worldwide in 1983. 49 A generic form of doxylamine/pyridoxine, Diclectin, remained on the mar - ket in Canada, where it continues to be first-line therapy for NVP .50 Following the withdrawal of Bendectin, 2 meta-analyses involving data from more than 200,000 pregnancies found no increased risk for major malformations with exposure to dox - ylamine/pyridoxine. 51,52 Subsequent studies have provided further support regarding the safety of doxylamine/pyridox - ine, finding no association with birth defects.16,53 Doxylamine/ pyridoxine has remained classified as risk level A in the stan - dard reference Drugs in Pregnancy and Lactation by Briggs, Freeman, and Yaffe.11 This rating was based on the authors' independent ongoing review of the evidence that found dox - ylamine/pyridoxine safe in human pregnancy, including in the first trimester. In 2004 and again in 2009, ACOG concluded that \"treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy with pyridoxine or pyridoxine plus doxylamine is safe and effective and should be considered first-line pharmacotherapy. \" 40 In 2005, the manufacturer of doxylamine/pyridox - ine in Canada submitted a new drug application to the FDA. As part of its review, the FDA required a new phase III placebo-controlled study to be conducted in the United States. 54 The study involved 241 women 7 to 14 weeks preg - nant experiencing NVP . Results showed doxylamine/pyri - doxine to be superior to placebo in improving NVP symp - toms (change from baseline in the PUQE score: -4.8 vs -3.9, respectively; P = .006). Nineteen percent of women took 2 tablets daily, 21% took 3 tablets daily, and 60% took 4 tab - lets daily. Quality of life after 2 weeks was also improved and women treated with doxylamine/pyridoxine required less rescue therapy and reported fewer days missed from work. In April 2013, the FDA approved Diclegis, the combination of doxylamine succinate 10 mg plus pyridoxine hydrochloride 10 mg delayed-release tablets, for the treatment of NVP in women who do not respond to conservative management. 34 The FDA also classified the product as pregnancy category A, which is the strongest evidence of fetal safety possible. Beyond safety, clinical studies as well as clinical experi - ence over more than 4 decades demonstrate the combination of doxylamine and pyridoxine to be effective in reducing the incidence and severity of NVP . 54 The product now available in the United States is recommended to be given as 2 tablets at bedtime. If symptoms are not adequately controlled within 24 to 48 hours, the dose can be increased to 4 tablets daily (1 tablet in the morning, 1 midafternoon, and 2 at bedtime).34 The morning dose can be added after 1 day and the after - noon dose after another day. Somnolence is the most com - mon adverse event observed (14.3% vs 11.7% for placebo), likely due to the anticholinergic effects of doxylamine, an H 1-receptor antagonist.34 Although the Cochrane systematic review cited above found only limited evidence to support the use of pharma - cological antiemetic agents for NVP , clinical experience indi - cates that some treatment options are effective. The FIGUR e shows a suggested approach for the pharmacologic treat - ment of women with NVP during early pregnancy. As the only medication approved by the FDA for NVP and as recom - mended by tablets are first-line pharmacologic therapy. 40 For those who have an inadequate response to doxylamine succinate/pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets, a drug from a different pharmacologic class, such as metoclopramide, should be added. This has the ben - efits of utilizing drugs with different mechanisms of action while reducing the likelihood of additive adverse events such as sedation. The same options are also appropriate as mono - therapy for women who are intolerant of doxylamine succi - nate/pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets. Adverse events are also a consideration when selecting treatment. The use of an antihistamine (H 1-receptor antagonist) or a phenothiazine may be limited by sedation, particularly with increasing doses. Although tardive dyskinesia may occur with a phenothiazine or metoclopramide, the risk is low with the doses and duration of therapy used for NVP . Another potential complication with metoclopramide is serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening set of symptoms caused by serotonin toxicity. The risk of serotonin syndrome is increased when a patient taking metoclopramide is also taking another medication that promotes serotonin activ - ity, such as an or ondansetron. [Note: many of these medica - tions are categorized as pregnancy class C or D by the FDA.] Serotonin syndrome may also be possible with ondansetron and is under investigation by the FDA. 55 Ondansetron is also associated with the potential for QT prolongation; investiga - tion to identify patients at high risk is ongoing.56 The fetal safety of ondansetron, a 5-hydroxytryptamine3- receptor antagonist, has been investigated in a retrospective review of data from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study involving women with NVP.

They have marked sedative properties, as well as anticholinergic and antiemetic actions. The anticholinergic action will Phenothiazines also cause tardive dyskinesia and would potentiate that adverse reaction if used with metoclopramide. If NVP persists after the above therapy, hyperemesis gravidarum should be considered and, if suspected, the patient should be hospitalized.S36 FEBR uaRy 2014 | Vol 63, No 2 | Supplement to The Journal of Family Practice [management of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy] without birth defects, children born of mothers treated with ondansetron during the first trimester showed an increased risk of cleft palate (odds ratio, 2.37). 48 The risks of nonsyn- dromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate, neural tube defects, and hypospadias were similar between controls and those treated with ondansetron. Recently, the results of 2 Danish studies investigating the fetal safety of ondanse-tron have been reported, but with opposite findings. Both were retrospective analyses based on birth defect and pre-scription medication information from similar registries and from overlapping time periods. One study involving 897,018 women found a doubling in the prevalence of major congenital heart defects in children whose mothers were treated with ondansetron during the first trimester of preg-nancy. 57 In the other study, involving 608,385 pregnancies, there was no increased risk of stillbirth, no major birth defect, and no infants born at low birth weight or at small size for ges - tational age associated with ondansetron exposure. 58 How- ever, the risk of preterm delivery was significantly increased with ondansetron (odds ratio, 1.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.55). The reason for these discrepant findings is unclear. In women with hyperemesis gravidarum refrac - tory to standard treatment (N = 16), no teratogenic effects were observed; however, 1 minor birth defect, 2 prema-ture births, and 6 pregnancy or neonatal adverse outcomes were observed. 59 Referral Pregnant women with severe symptoms of NVP , particularly those with an inadequate response to combination therapy and those who experience significant morbidity or complica - tions, should be considered for referral to an obstetrician or treatment in the hospital. sUMMARY Nausea and vomiting are common in early pregnancy. Forty percent or more of pregnant women may continue to suffer beyond the first trimester and 10% beyond the second tri - mester. A focus of the assessment is to confirm that the nau - sea and vomiting is due to the pregnancy and not some other cause. Nonpharmacologic options, particularly dietary mod - ification, are a mainstay of treatment. For those who continue to experience symptoms, pharmacologic management can be employed. The combination of doxylamine succinate/pyridoxine hydrochloride was reintroduced in the United States following FDA approval in early 2013. The product was given a pregnancy safety rating of A and is recommended as first-line pharmacologic treatment for NVP . Other options include antihistamines, metoclopramide, ondansetron, phe after lRefe Rences 1. Einarson TR, Piwko C, Koren G. Prevalence of nausea and vomiting of pregancy in the USA: a meta analysis.

What happens if I have the urge to go during the ceremony and can't make it to the bathroom? That would be so embarrassing. I don't want to have to wear a diaper. I've had this problem for years, but now I am so worried. Is there anything that can be done that will work quickly since the wedding is in 4 months?\" EPIDEMIOlOGY IN WOMEN The case study above illustrates several important issues related to overactive bladder (OAB): the significant impact on quality of life (QOL), the emotional toll, and the paradoxical delay in years for patients to seek treatment. Urgency urinary incontinence is 1 of the symptoms commonly experienced by persons with idiopathic (ie, non - neurogenic) OAB. Overactive bladder is a symptom complex characterized by urgency (the sudden, compelling desire to void that is difficult to defer), with or without urgency urinary incontinence, often associated with frequency (8 or more micturitions during a 24-hour period), and nocturia. The eti - ology of OAB is multifactorial and thought to be due to detru - sor overactivity and altered bladder afferent nerve activity. 1 Risk factors for OAB include advancing age, obesity, and diabetes. 2-5 Approximately 17% of adults worldwide suffer from OAB, including approximately 33 million adults in the United States.2,6,7 There is little difference in the prevalence of OAB in women (16.9%) and men (16.0%) in the United States, although 1 study estimated a higher prevalence in women than in men (26.1% vs 10.7%, respectively). 2,6,8 Women are more likely to experi - ence urgency urinary incontinence (also referred to as \"wet\" OAB). Wet OAB increases in prevalence with age; women aged 65 years or older are 2.5 times as likely and women aged 45 to 54 years are twice as likely as women aged 18 to 34 years to experience OAB symptoms. 8 Urgency urinary incontinence is the symptom that typically prompts patients, particularly women, to seek medical care. 7,9,10 IMPACT AND BArrIErs TO TrEATMENT The impact of OAB on QOL is considerable, resulting in limi - tations on physical activities, social interactions, and travel; work absence; avoidance of sexual intimacy; guilt; and loss of self-esteem. 11-13 The negative health impacts of OAB extend \"beyond the bladder\" and are often underappreci - ated. The most prevalent comorbidities occurring in higher percentages of patients with OAB vs controls are urinary tract infections (28.0% vs 8.4%, respectively), falls and fractures (25.3% vs 16.1%), (10.5% 4.9%), and skin infec - tions (3.9% vs 2.3%). 14 In a survey of over 6000 community- dwelling women, frequent urge incontinence was an inde - pendent risk factor for falling (odds ratio, 1.26) among women aged >65 years. 15 Incontinence is also a major factor leading to nursing home admission.16 Despite the considerable negative effects of OAB, it remains underdiagnosed and undertreated. Only about one-fourth to one-half of patients who have OAB ever seek medi - cal care, and among those who do, over half remain undiag - nosed. 2,9,17-19 Moreover, an analysis of over 7.2 million patients aged 45 years in the IMS Health data set revealed that only 24.4% of patients diagnosed with OAB were treated. 10 Among patients who do seek medical care for OAB symptoms, more than half wait longer than a year to seek treatment and typically do so only when symptoms and/or the impact on QOL have become intolerable or, as in the case above, threaten social embarrassment. 7,9,17,20 Patient- related barriers to seeking medical care include discomfort and embarrassment with discussing the issue with a health care provider; misperceptions of a lack of available treat - ment options or that treatment requires surgery or invasive procedures; and misperception that OAB is a normal part of aging. 2,21 Physicians often do not ask patients about OAB symptoms due to a reliance on patient complaint to trigger action; time constraints; lack of appreciation for the impact on QOL and other potential complications; or lack of aware - ness of available effective treatments. 7,22 Screening for OAB and the evaluation of OAB is rela - tively easily performed in the primary care setting. A history, focused physical examination (abdominal, pelvic, neuro - logic), and urinalysis are often all that are needed. 7,23 Further discussion of the diagnostic workup for OAB is beyond the scope of this article, but can be found in guidelines pub - lished by the American Urological Association (AUA) in 2012 (http://www.auanet.org/common/pdf/education/clinical-guidance/Overactive-Bladder.pdf). 23 OVEr VIEW OF TrEATMENT The goals of OAB treatment are to maximize symptom con-trol and improvement in QOL while minimizing other neg- S39 Supplement to The Journal of Family Practice | Vol 63, No 2 | FEBRUARY 2014S40 FEBRUARY 2014 | Vol 63, No 2 | Supplement to The Journal of Family Practice [management of idiopathic overactive bladder] ative health effects, treatment-related adverse events, and patient burden.23 Factors that may affect treatment selection include the patient's ability to perceive an improvement in his or her symptoms and QOL, comorbidities, and con-comitant medications. 22,23 For example, treatment-related may be inappropriate, unsafe, or futile in patients who cannot perceive symptom improvement (eg, very elderly, severely cognitively compromised). 23 However, in patients for whom hygiene and skin breakdown are major con-cerns, treatment may be considered regardless of patient perceptions. 23 Treatment of the patient with OAB involves patient education and behavioral modification as first-line ther - apy. Pharmacologic treatment with an antimuscarinic or, more recently, with mirabegron, is often used in combina- tion with behavioral intervention to maximize treatment benefit. For patients who are intolerant of or fail pharma-cologic therapy from an efficacy standpoint, intradetrusor injection of onabotulinumtoxinA and neuromodulation are available. Neuromodulation using sacral nerve stimu-lation or posterior tibial nerve stimulation is approved for the treatment of OAB, but will not be discussed in this article. Patient education is a cornerstone of effective treatment of OAB. 23 Understanding normal bladder control provides a comparator for assessing the patient's own treatment prog - ress and setting realistic expectations for symptom control (eg, understanding that most OAB treatments can improve symptoms but not eliminate them) likely contributes to bet - ter treatment adherence and outcome satisfaction. 21,23 Often, setting task-oriented goals (eg, being able to sit through a movie uninterrupted if that is not currently possible due to symptoms) instead of number-oriented goals (eg, reducing number of incontinence episodes per day from 6 to 3) is more motivating for patients. Understanding the benefits vs risks/burdens of available treatment options is also important for informed decision making. First-line treatment for OAB is behavioral modification (eg, bladder training, bladder control strategies, pelvic floor muscle training, fluid management, lifestyle changes such as weight loss, dietary changes). 23 Patient education resources may be found at: http://www.auanet.org/common/pdf/products/OAB PatientGuide.pdf tion are comparable to pharmacologic treatment and range from 50% to 80% reduction in frequency of urinary inconti-nence. 23,24 For patients who have an inadequate response to behavioral therapy, the addition of drug therapy can improve symptom control and QOL. 23,25,26 Given that many patients do not seek medical care until their symptoms become intoler - able, combination therapy to provide faster relief may be par - ticularly beneficial in many cases. CASE STUDY #1 ( continued ): Sally returns after 2 months of fol - lowing a behavioral modification plan and reports, \"I'm getting some relief of symptoms, but I'm still concerned that I'm going to have to wear a diaper during the ceremony. The wedding is in 2 months. Is there anything else we can do to help me gain better control of my bladder?\" CONsIDErATIONs IN PHArMACOlOGIC MANAGEMENT As sECOND-lINE THErAPY Antimuscarinic therapy is the gold standard for pharmaco - logic treatment of OAB and is often used in combination with behavioral therapy.23 Several antimuscarinic agents are now available which vary in their muscarinic receptor affinity, formulation, and dose flexibility ( Table 1 ).7,27-33 All antimus - carinics are effective for OAB, with differences in their mus - carinic receptor affinities possibly leading to differences in tolerability profiles. 34 It is generally felt that if a patient expe - riences inadequate symptom control and/or unacceptable adverse effects with 1 of the antimuscarinic agents, another may be tried. 23,35 Discontinuation rates of 80% to 90% within the first year of therapy have been reported for antimuscarinic agents used for OAB, with 1 study reporting a median of 31 days to dis - continuation. 21,36 A primary reason for the discontinuation of these agents is the burden of anticholinergic side effects such as somnolence, blurred vision, and particularly dry mouth and constipation. 23 Anticholinergic side effects are of particu - lar concern in the elderly. Clinicians can help mitigate these discontinuation rates by reviewing the patient's medication list to identify other medications that might potentiate anti - cholinergic side effects, as well as by educating patients about the likely side effects and steps to take to avoid or minimize their occurrence. For example, patients should be educated about dry mouth and advised to use sugar-free hard candies, chewing gum, or oral lubricants. Similarly, patients should be edu - cated about the risk of constipation and the importance of adequate fluid intake, dietary fiber and fiber supplements, and normal bowel habits. 23 At each visit, clinicians should S41 Supplement to The Journal of Family Practice | Vol 63, No 2 | FEBRUARY 2014 [management of idiopathic overactive bladder] inquire about these and other side effects the patient may be experiencing. If side effects to 1 antimuscarinic are intol - erable despite intervention, switching to an alternative for - mulation or another antimuscarinic should be tried. For example, compared with immediate-release oxybutynin, the extended-release (ER) and transdermal oxybutynin formula - tions are associated with lower rates of dry mouth. 23 Antimuscarinics are contraindicated in patients with nar - row angle glaucoma, impaired gastric emptying, or a history of urinary retention; caution is recommended even in patients with treated narrow angle glaucoma. 23 The use of an antimusca - rinic has not been evaluated in patients with myasthenia gravis and thus caution is recommended. Similarly, caution is advised in patients taking oral solid dose forms of potassium chloride because reduced gastric emptying may potentially increase potassium absorption. 23 Antimuscarinic agents may adversely affect cognitive function and should be used cautiously in the elderly and other higher risk populations. 23 Data regarding possible cardiac adverse effects of vari - ous antimuscarinics (ie, increased heart rate and QT interval prolongation [the latter via a mechanism unrelated to mus - carinic blockade]) are limited and vary among the agents. 37 Heart rate is modulated by the M2 receptor; thus, agents with a greater affinity for the M2 receptor may have a greater effect on heart rate. However, data to determine clinical relevance is lacking. 37 Most of the very limited data on QT interval pro - longation with antimuscarinic agents indicate no significant effect, but since thorough studies have not been performed with all agents, increased risk with some of them cannot be excluded. 37 TABLE 1 Characteristics of pharmacologic agents for treatment of overactive bladder7,27-33 Drug Dose range Dosage form Metabolism Receptor affinityOther notes Darifenacin (Enablex)7.5-15 mg once dailyT constipation (14.8% to 21.3%) (T isoformsM1, M2, is limited by high rates of dry mouth; ER associated with cognitive impairment Oxybutynin transdermal gel (Gelnique) by CYP450 and gel - ated with lower rates of dry mouth; transdermal patch associated with significant rate of skin reaction (lower with gel) Solifenacin (VESIcare)5-10 mg once dailyT ablet Hepatic by CYP450 isoformsM3 High rate of dry mouth at 10 mg dose (27.6% vs 10.9% at 5 mg) T olterodine LA (Detrol LA)2-4 mg once daily in the morning (XR)T ablet Active renal tubular secretion; no CYP450 should (Myrbetriq)25-50 mg once dailyT ablet, ER Multiple hepatic pathways, including CYP450 iso - (specifically CYP2D6, though to a limited extent)Beta-3 adrenergic receptorIncidence of dry HTN similar to placebo; significant CV , QT interval effects.

Therefore, selec - tion of antimuscarinic therapy for a particular patient depends on patient-specific factors such as comorbidities, concomitant medications, history of antimuscarinic use, cost and/or insur - ance reimbursement for various medications, and adverse events with previous antimuscarinic therapy. 29 Mirabegron An alternative to antimuscarinic therapy, mirabegron is a once-daily beta-3 adrenoreceptor agonist recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for OAB. Stimulation of the beta-3 adrenoreceptor relaxes detrusor smooth muscle, decreases afferent signaling from the bladder, improves bladder compliance upon filling, and increases bladder capacity with no change in micturition pressure and residual volume. 38,39 Its unique mechanism of action provides an alternative therapy for patients as a second line therapy for OAB, particularly in patients in whom contraindications exist to the use of antimus - carinic agents and/or those intolerant to antimuscarinic agents. The potential role of combination therapy with an antimusca - rinic agent and mirabegron in OAB is currently under study. 40 As monotherapy, the efficacy and tolerability of mirabe - gron have been demonstrated in phase II trials, in 3 pivotal, large-scale phase III multinational, randomized, controlled trials for up to 12 weeks (assessing 25 mg once daily and/or 50 mg once daily), and in 1 phase III study assessing 12-month safety and efficacy. 38,41-43 In a phase III trial, mirabegron 25 mg once daily demonstrated greater mean decreases from base - line vs placebo for incontinence episodes (-1.36 vs. -0.96; P = .005) and micturitions ( -1.65 vs. -1.18; P = .007) per 24 hours.42 In a head-to-head comparison, both mirabegron 50 or 100 mg/day and tolterodine ER 4 mg/day improved key OAB symptoms from the first measured time point of 4 weeks and maintained efficacy throughout the 12-month treatment period. 43 A pooled safety analysis of the three 12-week phase III studies yielded similar overall incidences of adverse effects in mirabegron (25-100 mg/day), placebo, and tolterodine ER 4 mg/day groups. 44 The most common drug-related adverse events in the mirabegron groups were hypertension (3.4% to 6.9%, not dose-related) and headache (0.9% to 2.0%, not dose-related), which were similar in incidence to placebo and tolterodine ER; and dry mouth, which was similar between the mirabegron (0.9% to 2.2%, not dose-related) and placebo (1.6%) groups, but of a higher incidence in the tolterodine ER group (9.5%). There were no significant cardiovascular events and no effects on the QT interval in the mirabegron groups. In healthy volunteers, mirabegron has not shown an association with QT prolongation at the 50 mg or 100 mg doses, but did so at the 200 mg dose in females.45 Mirabegron increased heart rate in these subjects in a dose-dependent manner (6.7, 11, and 17 beats per minute mean increase from baseline for the 50, 100, and 200 mg doses, respectively). 32,45 In this and another healthy volunteer study, mirabegron was also associated with dose-dependent increases in systolic blood pressure (3.0, 5.5, and 9.7 mm Hg in 1 study and 2.5, 4.5, and 6.5 mm Hg in another study for 50, 100, and 200 mg doses, respectively). 32 Given its side effect profile, mirabegron may be particu - larly useful for patients in whom antimuscarinic-associated dry mouth is intolerable, but may be used in antimuscarinic naive patients also ( Table 1 ). Periodic blood pressure deter - minations, especially in hypertensive patients, are recom - mended. Mirabegron should be avoided in patients with severe, uncontrolled hypertension. 32 CASE STUDY #1 (continued): Sally's primary care provider discusses adding antimuscarinic therapy to her behavior manage - ment therapy, to which Sally readily agrees. Sally is educated about common anticholinergic side effects and is advised to avoid driv - ing shortly after taking a dose and to check with her primary care provider or pharmacist before starting any new medications (includ - ing nonprescription medications). She is also educated about steps to take to minimize dry mouth and constipation. A follow-up visit is scheduled prior to the wedding. CASE STUDY #2: Mildred, a 69-year-old patient who has been taking tolterodine ER for OAB for 4 months, returns for follow-up and reports: \"These pills don't work and they make my mouth dry. I take so many medications, I don't want another pill. I've given up coffee, tea, and chocolate and my symptoms are no better. What else can be done to control my bladder symptoms? I don't like the idea of a permanent device in my body.\" INTrADETrusOr INJECTION OF ONABOTulINuMTOXINA Intradetrusor injection of onabotulinumtoxinA, approved by the FDA in January 2013 for patients with OAB, inhibits the neuronal release of acetylcholine, the neurotransmitter involved in detrusor Intradetrusor onabotu - linumtoxinA is considered a third-line treatment that may be offered to carefully selected and thoroughly counseled patients who have failed treatment with antimuscarinic therapy (from either an efficacy or tolerability standpoint). Patients must be able and willing to return for frequent postvoid residual (PVR) evaluation and to perform self- catheterization if necessary. 23 S43 Supplement to The Journal of Family Practice | Vol 63, No 2 | FEBRUARY 2014 [management of idiopathic overactive bladder] Administration of intradetrusor onabotulinumtoxinA is a minimally invasive procedure that may be done in the office or in the operating room under IV sedation, depending on patient-specific factors. It involves injection (100 units/10 mL via 20 injections of 0.5 mL each) into the detrusor muscle via flexible or rigid cystoscope. 46,47 Patients should be considered for reinjection when the clinical effect has diminished (median time in clinical trials was 169 days) but no sooner than 12 weeks from the prior bladder injec - tion. 46 Since the total dose that can be administered over a 3-month period is 360 units for all indications combined, it is important to determine if the patient has received onabotu - linumtoxinA for any other indications, or is planning to, dur - ing the months before and after administration for OAB. 46 TABLE 2 Selected clinical trials of onabotulinumtoxinA in idiopathic overactive bladder Study description Previous therapy Treatment arms Efficacy outcomes Safety outcomes Nitti et al48 R, DB, PC, 2.6 y; mean number 2.4-2.5OnabotulinumtoxinA 100 units x 1 with repeat treat - ment any time after 12 wks at patient request if they had 2 UUI episodes during 3 d (n = 280) vs Placebo (n = 277)Change from baseline at 12 wks: 41.1 vs 9.7 mL a I-QOL total summary score, 21.9 vs 6.8 aAt 12 wks (%): UTIs, 15.5 vs 5.9Dysuria, 12.2 vs 9.6Bacteriuria, 5.0 vs 5.8UR, c 5.4 vs 0.4 Chapple et al49 R, 2.3-2.5OnabotulinumtoxinA 100 units x 1 (n = 277) vsPlacebo (n = 271)Change from baseline at d KHQ - proportion improved or greatly improved on treatment benefit scale: 62.8 vs 26.8 aAt 12 wks (%): UTIs, 20.4 vs 5.2Dysuria, 5.8 vs 3.7Bacteriuria, 3.6 vs 2.2UR, 5.8 vs 0.4CIC, e 6.9 vs 0.7 Dmochowski et al50 R, DB, PC, phase II dose ranging study (50 U, 100 U, 150 U, 200 U, 300 U) f Duration: 36 wks Baseline: 8 UUI episodes/wk8 micturitions/dAnticholinergics OnabotulinumtoxinA 100 units x 1 (n = 54) vsPlacebo (n = 44)Change from baseline at 12 36 wks (%): UTIs, 36.4 vs 16.3UR, 18.2 vs 2.3 CIC, 10.9 vs 0 Abbreviations: AE, adverse event; 0.001 vs placebo. bP .05 vs placebo. cPVR 200 mL requiring CIC. dP < .01 vs placebo. eIndications for CIC: PVR350 PVR 200-350 fOnly onabotulinumtoxinA 100-unit arm results reported here.S44 FEBRUARY 2014 | Vol 63, No 2 | Supplement to The Journal of Family Practice [management of idiopathic overactive bladder] Several randomized, controlled clinical dem- the efficacy of onabotulinumtoxinA in decreas - ing incontinence episodes, frequency, and urgency, and in improving QOL ( Table 2 ).48-50 The 2- to 4-fold improvement over placebo in all symptoms of OAB observed in clini-cal trials of onabotulinumtoxinA 100 units is noteworthy, as an effect of this magnitude does not seem to have been reported with antimuscarinics or mirabegron. 51 Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) was the most frequently reported adverse event observed with ona - botulinumtoxinA in clinical trials.48,49 A significant increase in the PVR volume was also seen, requiring clean intermittent catheterization in 6.1% to 6.9% of patients. Clean intermittent catheterization was initiated if PVR 200 mL; <350 mL with associated symptoms; or 350 mL, regardless of symptoms. Discontinuation rates due to adverse effects were approxi - mately 1% at 12 weeks in the 2 trials. Due to the limited diffusion and localized injections of onabotulinumtoxinA, the likelihood of systemic side effects is very low. However, there are postmarketing reports of symptoms occurring hours to weeks after injection: incontinence, and breath - ing difficulties. 46 Although the risk is likely greatest in chil - dren treated for spasticity as opposed to adults treated for OAB or other indications, OAB patients should be counseled accordingly. CASE STUDY #2 (continued): The primary care provider dis - cusses the benefits and limitations of the transdermal patch and gel formulations of oxybutynin and of intradetrusor injection of onabotu - linumtoxinA. Since side effects may be less bothersome with oxy - butynin transdermal patch and it is available without a prescription, Mildred agrees to try it for a month. A month later, Mildred returns and reports that her symptoms are minimally improved. She is noted to have significant skin irritation at the site of administration. Mildred and her primary care provider discuss onabotulinumtoxinA and agree that she should be referred to a urologist. CONsIDErATIONs FOr rEFErrAl While most patients with OAB can be managed in the pri - mary care setting, several situations warrant consideration for referral to a specialist. These include physician uncer - tainty regarding the diagnosis, obstructive voiding symptoms (eg, sensation of incomplete emptying, straining to void), sig - nificant pelvic organ prolapse, prior pelvic surgery - hematuria, recurrent UTIs, or comorbid neurologic con - ditions that may affect bladder function (eg, stroke, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury).23 In addition, patients who have failed adequate trials of antimuscarinic or mirabegron ther - apy should be considered for referral to a urologist or urogy - necologist for intradetrusor injection of onabotulinumtoxinA or neuromodulation. CONClusION Overactive bladder is a common symptom complex that has a considerable negative impact on health and QOL, yet still remains underdiagnosed and undertreated. A history, focused physical examination (abdominal, pelvic, neuro - logic), and urinalysis is often all that is needed for evaluation. While patient education and behavioral modification are the cornerstones of treatment, several new treatment options provide for greater opportunity for individualized pharmaco - logic management in primary care. For those refractory to or intolerant of pharmacologic therapy, intradetrusor injection of onabotulinumtoxinA is a new option. l REFERENCES 1. Yoshida M, Masunaga K, Nagata T, Yono M, Homma Y.

The recognition of CM as a migraine subtype, along with EM, underscored the clinical importance of CM. Episodic migraine Episodic migraine is characterized by headache features that include unilateral location, pulsating quality, moderate or severe intensity, and aggravation by routine physical activity ( Table ). Nonheadache associated features include nausea and/or photophobia and phonophobia. Episodic migraine can be divided into migraine with or without aura. While many patients experience both, approximately 30% of migraines are associated with aura occurring prior to or during the headache phase of the attack. 9 Auras are considered a consequence of an electrical event in the brain called spreading cortical depres - sion and consist of fully reversible focal neurological symp - toms that are visual or sensory in nature. More importantly, EM is characterized by a return to normal baseline neurologi - cal function between each episode. Chronic migraine Chronic migraine often follows years after the onset of EM, and because of that, CM can be considered a complication of EM. 7 As headache frequency increases, migraines begin to lose their episodic nature and there is little or no time for neurological recovery between headaches. 10 Consequently, symptoms and disability are variable. This often leads to diagnostic uncertainty since patients typically report to their health care provider only their worst headache days as being migraine. Because the stereotypic nature of migraine observed in EM is less clear in CM, CM is measured in head - ache days rather than in attacks or episodes. CM is defined as 15 days of headache per month for more than 3 months, of which 8 or more headache days per month must fulfill the IHS criteria cited above for EM. 11 Other headache days may have features of tension-type or probable migraine and as such it is entirely possible that patients with CM experience more days with headache other than migraine than those that meet the IHS criteria for migraine. Because the treatment need for CM is great, patients frequently overuse acute medication. This results often in another type of headache called MOH (previously called rebound headache). Medication overuse headache is partic - ularly common with simple analgesics and triptans, as well as with caffeine, opioids, and barbiturates, although opioids and barbiturates are generally not recommended for man - agement of EM or CM. 12 In order to obtain an accurate understanding of headache days, it is valuable to ask patients how many days per month they are totally free of headache. The answer to this question is S47 Supplement to The Journal of Family Practice | Vol 63, No 2 | FEBRUARY 2014While 70% of the migraine population is managed in a pri - mary care setting, it is estimated that a quarter are dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with their care. 5 To a significant degree, this is due to a failure to adequately treat EM and institute effective preventive measures early to halt the progression of EM to CM. 6 CASE STUDY: Rita is a 38-year-old woman who was diagnosed 12 years ago with migraine without aura. Her migraines responded to naproxen sodium until several years ago, at which time she was pre - scribed a triptan. Over the past 12 to 18 months, Rita has increasingly observed that her response to triptan therapy has been less robust, noting recurring headache within 1 to 2 days following triptan therapy. This mandated an additional dose of her triptan and naproxen sodium. When the headache is particularly debilitating, she also supplements her treatment with an over-the-counter headache combination product. Review of her headache diary shows that Rita now experiences 3 to 4 migraines fulfilling International Headache Society (IHS) criteria 7 per month, but with headache of moderate to severe intensity occurring on 12 to 15 days per month. She was prescribed topiramate 1 year ago, but it was discontinued because she experienced cognitive changes as the dose was increased. The increasing frequency of Rita's migraine headaches and the growing lack of response to naproxen sodium and trip-tan therapy indicate that her diagnosis should be reevalu-ated and other possible contributory causes should be investigated. In addition, the subtype of migraine and treat - ment plan should be reassessed. DIFFeReNTIATING ePIsODIC MIGRAINe FROM CHRONIC MIGRAINe It has only been within the past few years that consensus- based criteria for CM have become established and the clinical features of CM have been recognized. It was not until 2004 that a formal definition of CM was adopted by the IHS, with further refinement in 2005. 7,8 It should be made clear that other terms, such as chronic daily headache, transformed migraine, and medication overuse headache S48 FEBRUARY 2014 | Vol 63, No 2 | Supplement to The Journal of Family Practice [CHRONIC MIGRAINE IN wOMEN] often much more revealing than the number of migraine epi - sodes per month.12,13 Relative to EM, headache-related disability is greater in CM and serves as an important issue to discuss with patients when assessing impact. However, headache-related disabil - ity can vary during a migraine attack, as well as from 1 attack to another. Results of the American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention study (N = 162,576) showed that, during a severe headache, 54% of patients with migraine experienced severe impairment or required bed rest, while 46% experienced only some or no impairment. 14 Chronic migraine patients are less likely than patients with EM to be employed full-time, 2 to 3 times as likely to experience reduced occupational or household productiv - ity, and 4 times as likely to experience missed family activi - ties. The risk of anxiety, chronic pain, or depression is almost twice as high in patients with CM as with EM. 13,15,16 In addition, patients with CM have a 50% to 70% higher risk of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a 40% higher risk of heart disease and angina, and a 65% higher risk of stroke than patients with EM. 13 Compared with patients with EM, those with CM are more likely to have visited a primary care physician within the past 3 months (13.9% vs 26.2%; P < .001) and have higher total mean headache-related costs during a 3-month period ($383 vs $1036; P < .001). 17 These factors underscore the importance and value of a pri - mary care physician's involvement in managing the patient with migraine. Several risk factors for development of CM have been identified. These include frequent EM, poor response to acute migraine treatment, major stressors, depression, anxiety, snor - ing and sleep apnea, obesity, and overuse of acute treatment medications. 18,19 There are also associated nonmodifiable risk factors such as older age, female gender, Caucasian race, low educational level/socioeconomic status, and head injury. 12,13 CASE STUDY (continued): Upon further questioning by her primary care physician, Rita states that she has only 4 or 5 days per month where she is truly headache-free. She is now using some form of acute medication 4 or 5 days per week. Rita is missing work and unable to care for her family for 24 to 36 hours during each of the 3 or 4 severe migraine attacks she experiences each month. Rita acknowl - edges feelings of depression and difficulty sleeping. MANAGeMeNT OF CHRONIC MIGRAINe It must be realized that because CM was recognized as a migraine subtype only a few years ago, the comprehensive management of patients with CM is unclear. Few clinical trials of pharmacologic therapies have been conducted in patients meeting the definition of CM. Those that have been done involve preventive therapy for CM. Beyond this limited information, the management of patients with CM draws on experience treating other migraine subtypes, particularly EM, although its applicability to CM is relatively unproven. Managing CM successfully requires patients to actively participate in decisions related to their management. As a largely self-managed chronic disease, the appropriate use (and avoidance of overuse) of medications ultimately rests with the patient. The health care provider has a critical role in therapeu - tic decision making and appropriate prescribing, as well as edu - cating the patient regarding the risks of medications, including avoiding their overuse. Another principle of management is that the focus of treat - ment should be on the whole patient and not solely on the TABLE Selected clinical differences between episodic and chronic migraine Abbreviation: SD, standard deviation. aP < .05 With kind permission from Springer Science+Business Media: Curr Pain Headache Rep, Defining the differences between episodic migraine and chronic migraine, volume 16, 2012, page 88, Katsarava Z, Buse DC, Manack AN, Lipton RB, Table 1.Feature Episodic migraine Chronic migraine Headache frequency, days/month <15 15 Experience severe headache pain, % 78.1% 92.4%a Duration of headache without medication, mean hours 38.8 65.1a Duration of headache with medication, mean hours 12.8 24.1a Age, mean years (SD) 46.0 (13.8) 47.7a (14.0) Women, % 80.0 78.6 Occupationally disabled, % 11.1 20.0aS49 Supplement to The Journal of Family Practice | Vol 63, No 2 | FEBRUARY 2014 [CHRONIC MIGRAINE IN wOMEN] migraine episodes. Consequently, in addition to considering severity of illness, comorbidities, and prior response to medica - tions, treatment should be individualized to include the patient's needs, preferences, and values. This underscores the central role of primary care in management of the migraine patient. There are 4 components of treatment: patient educa - tion and support, nonpharmacologic therapy, pharmacologic therapy, and ongoing assessment. A key aspect of patient edu - cation is to discuss a patient's treatment expectations in order to create alignment in establishing realistic therapeutic goals. These goals need to be important to the patient and the time to achieve them should be realistic. A clinical benefit with preven - tive therapies, for example, often takes 2 to 3 months. Although not discussed in this article, incorporating appropriate non - pharmacological therapies, such as diet, sleep hygiene, exer - cise, and use of complementary and alternative therapies such as acupuncture, is generally helpful. 20-22 Pharmacologic treatment of chronic migraine The overarching goals of pharmacologic treatment for CM are to reduce the headache burden and improve functioning and quality of life, while avoiding treatment-related side effects and complications. To achieve these goals, both acute and preven - tive measures need to be utilized. Acute or abortive therapies are utilized by patients with migraine to stop the attack once begun. This is often problematic in patients with CM as the need for acute treatment\u2014and the risk of MOH\u2014are high. Consequently, building therapeutic strategies for the spectrum of attacks, rather than defining a patient's profile, is important. 23 This is accomplished by providing appropriate drugs and formula - tions to match the treatment needs of each patient. For almost all patients with CM, preventive therapies are appropriate. 24 Regular follow-up involving review of the patient's headache diary pro - vides an opportunity to refine and optimize treatment efforts. The use and evaluation of preventive care may be guided by headache assessment tools such as the Headache Impact Test 25 or the Migraine Disability Assessment questionnaire.26 Selecting abortive treatment Patients with CM have significant need for abortive medica - tions and are at high risk for MOH. Thus, treatment needs to be patient-specific and the health care provider needs to pro - vide the best therapeutic choice for the specific presentations of migraine that the patient experiences. For example, since an early morning migraine is often associated with nausea, providing an oral medication is unlikely to be effective. There - fore, an injectable or nasal spray is more likely to achieve a better outcome and ultimately, less medication utilization. Gastric stasis or gastric atony is common in migraine patients, resulting in poor absorption of oral medications. Such patients often have an inconsistent response to oral medica - tions. On the other hand, a person with migraine that has a definite mild headache phase will likely respond well to early intervention with a triptan or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Another factor to consider in selecting treat - ment is the patient's treatment dynamics. Some patients, for example, \"wait to see\" if the headache attack will merit use of a prescription medication. Others reserve their prescription medication in case they have a worse headache in the future. Patients with CM often need more than 1 formulation of abortive medication; a wide variety is available. Migraine-specific medications such as triptans, dihydroergotamine, and ergota - mine target 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on blood vessels and pain-sensing nerves. 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonists are generally the most effec - tive agents available in aborting the attack and related symp-toms. 27 Among the 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonists, sumatriptan is the most effective abortive treatment for migraine.28,29 Sumatrip - tan tablets are commonly used, but are less effective than the nasal spray or especially, injectable formulations. 30 Consequently, sumatriptan tablets are more likely to be overused and cause MOH. Contraindications, adverse events, and cost are important considerations in treatment selection. It is also important to keep in mind that the ineffectively treated migraine has a sig - nificant cost associated with it in terms of increased medical utilization, impact at home and in the workplace, and most of all, to the individual. 31 Non-migraine-specific medications can also be highly effective and should be provided as a therapeutic tool based on their efficacy, rather than on convenience, availability, or cost. Treatment that is most likely to rapidly, safely, and com - pletely abort a migraine attack and provide sustained normal functioning for the patient should be selected. One ineffective approach is to stage acute treatment or arbitrarily begin with 1 medication and add another if the first is ineffective. This approach often does little more than add attack-related disabil - ity and increase the likelihood of therapeutic failure. Instead, it is often best to combine acute treatments at the outset based on what is likely to be effective, including nonprescription analge - sics, prescription NSAIDs, antiemetics, (continued): Rita's primary care provider diag - nosed her with CM and MOH. She was started on amitriptyline to improve sleep, treat depression, and as preventive therapy to reduce migraine frequency. She is instructed to slowly titrate the dose to 75 mg at bedtime. In addition. Rita is provided with specific acute treat - ment strategies. She is advised to initiate treatment early when the pain is escalating, but still mild to moderate. She was provided with subcu - taneous sumatriptan as first-line treatment for migraine associated with nausea and for rescue and advised to not use sumatriptan more than S50 FEBRUARY 2014 | Vol 63, No 2 | Supplement to The Journal of Family Practice [CHRONIC MIGRAINE IN wOMEN] 2 days per week. She is provided with diclofenac potassium to use on alternate days if needed, but also fewer than 2 days per week. Goals are established to improve acute treatment outcome and reduce the overall quantity of acute medications being used. She agrees to return in 2 weeks for a follow-up visit. Preventive treatment Preventive therapy is of central importance in the management of patients with CM. Preventive therapy is appropriate in those: (1) who experience 2 attacks/month that produce disability that lasts 3 days/month; (2) who have a contraindication to or fail - ure of abortive treatments; (3) who use an abortive medication >2 times per week; or (4) with an uncommon migraine condition, such as hemiplegic migraine, migraine with prolonged aura, or migrainous infarction. 32 In addition, preventive therapy should be utilized in those with comorbidities and those with increasing frequency of EM to prevent the transformation into CM. A wide variety of medications that work as preventive treatment for EM have also been utilized as preventive therapy for CM. However, their efficacy in CM is uncertain, as few have actually been studied in CM. Two medications that have been evaluated specifically as preventatives in patients with CM are topiramate and onabotulinumtoxinA. Only onabotulinumtox - inA has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administra - tion (FDA) for the indication of CM. Topiramate The efficacy of topiramate as preventive therapy for CM has been studied in 306 patients with CM. 33 Topiramate 100 mg/day was associated with a 5.8 day reduction in headache days per month compared with 4.7 days for placebo ( P = .067). Significant improvements were observed in patient disability and quality of life. For example, 69% of patients treated with topiramate experienced a 25% or greater reduction in the number of head - ache days per month compared with 52% of placebo-treated patients ( P = .005). Reductions were observed with topiramate compared with placebo in worst daily severity of migraine (P = .016), severity of photophobia ( P = .032), as well as fre - quency of vomiting ( P = .018), photophobia ( P = .038), pho - nophobia ( P = .010), unilateral pain ( P = .015), pulsatile pain (P = .023), and pain worsened by physical activity ( P = .047). OnabotulinumtoxinA Used in conditions such as spasticity for more than 2 decades, onabotulinumtoxinA inhibits the vesicular release of acetylcho - line from neurons, resulting in partial chemical denervation of the muscle. In animals and trigeminal cell cultures, onabotu - linumtoxinA blocks vesicular release of calcitonin gene-related the same synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) mechanisms occurring in motor neurons. 34,35 Both of these mechanisms may have relevance to the efficacy of onabotulinumtoxinA in migraine. The efficacy and safety of onabotulinumtoxinA in patients with CM have been investigated in 2 prospective, randomized, multicenter clinical trials: the Phase III Research Evaluating Migraine Prophylaxis Therapy (PREEMPT) trials. 36,37 In both PREEMPT trials, patients were randomized to onabotulinum - toxinA 155 to 195 units or placebo every 12 weeks for 2 cycles. In the PREEMPT 1 trial (N = 679), the mean change in number of headache episodes, the primary efficacy endpoint, was similar for onabotulinumtoxinA and placebo (-5.2 vs -5.3, respectively; P = .344), although the numbers of headache days ( P = .006) and migraine days ( P = .002) were lower with onabotulinum - toxinA. 36 In the PREEMPT 2 trial (N = 705), the mean change in frequency of headache days per 28 days, the primary efficacy endpoint, was significantly improved with onabotulinum - toxinA compared with placebo (-9.0 vs -6.7, respectively; P < .001). 37 In the subset of patients with CM and MOH, a planned pooled analysis showed greater improvement in num - ber of headache days and all secondary endpoints.38 A planned pooled analysis of all patients included in PREEMPT 1 and 2 showed that, with the exception of fre - quency of acute headache pain medication intake, improve - ments in all secondary endpoints were significantly greater with onabotulinumtoxinA than placebo. 39 Secondary end - points included frequency of migraine days, frequency of moderate/severe headache days, number of cumulative hours of headache on headache days, proportion of patients with severe (60 points) Headache Impact Test scores, frequency of headache episodes, and frequency of migraine episodes. Most adverse events were mild or moderate in severity and resolved without sequelae. The most frequently reported adverse events leading to discontinuation were neck pain (0.6%), mus - cular weakness (0.4%), headache (0.4%), and migraine (0.4%) in the onabotulinumtoxinA group. OnabotulinumtoxinA has been compared with topira - mate as preventive therapy in a randomized, double-blind, pilot study involving 59 patients with CM. 40 Following 12 weeks of treatment, significant improvement in the treatment responder rate and all secondary endpoints, including quality of life, was observed in patients treated with either onabotulinumtoxinA or topiramate, with no difference between groups. These efficacy results as preventive therapy are similar to an earlier pilot study in 60 patients treated with onabotulinumtoxinA (maximum 200 units/3 months) or topiramate 100 mg/day over 9 months. 41 Adverse events with onabotulinumtoxinA were generally char - acterized by weakness in muscle groups in the local vicinity of injection sites around the head and neck (especially eyebrow/ eyelid and forehead/neck), while those with topiramate S51 Supplement to The Journal of Family Practice | Vol 63, No 2 | FEBRUARY 2014 [CHRONIC MIGRAINE IN wOMEN] generally involved systemic effects such as cognitive deficits, paresthesias, loss of appetite, and weight loss. Treatment-related discontinuation occurred in 7.7% of patients treated with ona - botulinumtoxinA and 24.1% of patients treated with topiramate. 41 CASE STUDY (continued): Rita returns in 3 months. She is sleeping better and her mood is improved, but she continues with 18 headache days per month. She has reduced her work absenteeism with use of subcutaneous sumatriptan and diclofenac potassium, but continues with significant migraine-related disability at home. Rita and her primary care provider discuss the need for modifying her preventive treatment plan and agree to a trial of at least 2 injection cycles of ona - botulinumtoxinA. Rita is reminded of the importance of not overusing her abortive medications and is provided with additional diaries to track her acute treatment successes and failures as well as the number of headache days she experiences. sUMMARY Chronic migraine is a frequent, severely disabling headache that often evolves from EM. Treatment should be individu - alized with consideration of the patient as a whole person rather than just the headaches. Many options have been used for acute and preventive pharmacologic management, although good scientific and clinical evidence is limited to a few options. Evidence supports the efficacy and tolerability of both topiramate and onabotulinumtoxinA for prevention of CM headaches. However, only onabotulinumtoxinA is approved by the FDA for preventive treatment of CM. l REFERENCES 1. Stovner L, Hagen K, Jensen R, et al.
