Before we start our in-depth discussion of the differences between MD and DO paths, it's important to demonstrate the main admissions differences between these two options. So let's have a look at the most competitive DO and MD schools to review allopathic [medical school acceptance rates](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/us-med-schools-admissions-statistics) vs [DO school acceptance rates](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/do-school-acceptance-rates) and admissions expectations: Most Competitive MD Schools 1.

However, stats don't tell the whole story, so we need to discuss the philosophical, practical, and career differences between DO and MD schools. DO vs MD: Main Philosophical Differences Arguably, the main difference between DO vs MD programs is the philosophy behind their approach to medicine. Your answer to the question \" [Why do you want to be a doctor?](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/how-to-answer-the-interview-question-why-do-you-want-to-become-a-doctor)\" will have a great effect on whether you choose DO vs MD. MD programs, or allopathic medical programs, are rooted in the German model of medical education and emphasize evidence-based evaluation of the patients. This is what we have come to know as \"Western medicine\". Osteopathic medicine is a science-based discipline that focuses on the whole person, rather than a collection of body parts that may become injured or diseased. DO programs, or osteopathic medical training, teaches that the whole person is greater than the sum of his or her parts. Osteopathic medicine emphasizes the examination and understanding of the patient and although it has gone through many changes since its beginnings, it maintains its core values. The distinguishing philosophy of osteopathy and its practice is to provide care that is holistic, mainly preventative, and focused on health rather than disease, delivered within a primary care context. Main tenets of osteopathic medicine: According to these tenets, DO physicians tend to choose primary care specialties, such as [family medicine](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/family-medicine-residency), pediatrics, and [internal medicine](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/internal-medicine-residency) since they allow for a more holistic approach to patient treatment. While MD physicians also go into these exact same specialties, MDs are more represented in focused specialties like dermatology or orthopedics. This does not mean that DOs cannot pursue these specialties, but primary care is a more common route for DO graduates. Applying to DO schools? We can help! DO vs MD: Main Application Differences What Application Service Do American Allopathic and Osteopathic Medical Programs Use? Most American allopathic medical programs participate in the AMCAS and [TMDSAS](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/texas-medical-school-application-tmdsas) services. Both of these application systems are used by most students to apply to medical schools across the United States. Osteopathic medical schools have their own centralized application system, [AACOMAS](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/osteopathic-medical-schools), which simplifies the [DO school application process](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/do-school-application-osteopathic-medicine). When Do the Application Cycles Begin and End? The AMCAS application cycle starts in May and ends in January of the following year. The AACOMAS application cycle opens in May and closes in April of the following year. Each college has its own [medical school application timelines](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/medical-school-application-timeline) so make sure to confirm the deadlines with your school of choice. What are the Application Requirements? While there are some DO and MD [medical schools that do not require the MCAT](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/list-of-medical-schools-that-don-t-require-mcat), most osteopathic and allopathic programs demand that their applicants meet certain [medical school GPA requirements](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/medical-school-gpa-requirements) and [MCAT score](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/mcat-score) thresholds. You should also keep in mind that many DO and MD programs require the completion of the [Altus Suite](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/altus-suite) assessment. If your schools are among the [medical schools that require CASPer](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/medical-schools-that-require-casper), you might also be required to complete the [Snapshot](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/casper-snapshot) interview and the [Duet](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/duet) profile. Make sure you know [how to prepare for CASPer](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/casper-prep-tips), as it remains the most challenging component of Altus Suite. What are the Prerequisites? There are also certain [medical school requirements](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/medical-school-requirements) that every applicant must meet in order to be an eligible candidate. Both MD and DO applicants must have a Bachelor's degree, or at least meet the required minimum of undergraduate coursework set by each medical school. Some applicants have also completed master's or doctoral degrees at the time of application. Many MD and DO programs have general [medical school prerequisites](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/prerequisites-for-medical-school), but the specific course requirements vary from school to school. Generally, both MD and DO programs require experience in the following: AACOM programs' handbook also specifies that one year of English composition is preferred. Each medical program may have specific prerequisite requirements. Please check each program's course requirements before you apply. Clinical Experience Just like MD programs, DO programs encourage their applicants to learn more about medical practice by gaining clinical experience. Whether you are applying to osteopathic or allopathic programs, clinical experience is one of the most important [extracurriculars for medical school](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/extracurriculars-for-medical-school) that you need to demonstrate in your application. While some medical school programs say that clinical experience is not a requirement, getting accepted without any clinical experience is very difficult. What are the Benefits of Getting Clinical Experience? Shadowing Experience What is Shadowing? Shadowing of physicians is a well-known and commonplace practice. Both MD and DO applicants should gain substantial experience to strengthen their applications. If you're not sure [how much shadowing for medical school](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/shadowing-hours-for-medical-school) you need, check out our blog. How do I Start Shadowing? To gain shadowing experience, you should reach out to either MD or DO physicians, respectively, during your undergraduate education. Do this as early as possible! You can find a physician through college admissions and alumni offices. When you contact them, explain that you are looking to shadow and learn more about the clinical aspect of medicine. What Type of Shadowing Experience is Best? It's very important that you gain shadowing experience in the field you're interested in. If you are a DO applicant, make sure to shadow a DO physician and not just an MD. How Can I Find Shadowing Opportunities? You do not need to go far to search for a physician to shadow. Start by asking your own family doctor if they take on students. If not, see if they can recommend a doctor they know. To broaden your search, start by visiting the American Medical Association (AMA) or the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) websites. Typically, these websites provide lists of physicians you can potentially shadow and their contact information. While you're on the web, try simply searching for your state's allopathic and osteopathic associations. These organizations' websites often post lists of their members interested in having shadowing students. After I Find a Viable Opportunity, What Should I Do? Once you find the doctor you want to shadow, send an email or call the physician. Do not be discouraged if you do not hear from them right away or if you do not get to talk directly with the physician. Shadowing can be arranged through office administration. Most physicians will be pleased to mentor you, so be sure to express your interest and enthusiasm for the profession when you contact them. This is a good opportunity to learn what a physician does and may help you decide whether you want to pursue medical education! Get some more tips on [how to ask to shadow a doctor](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/how-to-ask-to-shadow-a-doctor) in our blog and make sure that if you are applying to DO schools, you have experience shadowing a DO doctor. Personal Qualities and Experiences Both MD and DO programs look for applicants who can demonstrate the following qualities and experiences: Personal Statement What are the Formatting Requirements of the Personal Statement? As part of your MD or DO school application, you will be required to submit a personal statement. The length of personal statements in AMCAS and AACOMAS is limited to 5300 characters including spaces, while TMDSAS statement has 5000 characters limit. In both statements, you must include specific life events, work, and volunteer experiences, and extracurriculars that solidified your commitment to medicine. The statement should also include your general plans and aspirations in the medical field. A personal statement must articulate and showcase your motivation to be a physician. How are DO and MD Personal Statements Different? Although DO and MD personal statements may seem similar, they will differ in content. You cannot just rewrite your MD statement with a few changes to pass it off as your DO statement. The DO personal statement needs to include experiences and reflections relevant to your interest in osteopathy. It should answer the question of \" [why osteopathic medicine](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/why-osteopathic-medicine-secondary-essay)?\". When writing your essay, you should consider the specifics of the theoretical approach in allopathy vs osteopathy and the differences in clinical practice between MD and DO physicians. Based on this information, you can decide what personal experiences to include in the statement and how to write about them. Where Can I Find Examples and More Information on How to Write an Outstanding Letter? Check out some [AACOMAS personal statement examples](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/aacomas-personal-statement-examples) to learn how to write an outstanding DO personal statement.

Want help with your med school application? Hear what our students have to say about us: Letters of Recommendation Both programs require recommendation letters as part of their application process. The letters are submitted electronically through the AAMC or TMDSAS for MD applicants and AACOMAS for DO applicants. Who Should Write My Letters of Recommendation? These letters must be written by recommenders who are ready to give you outstanding references. You do not want mediocre recommendation letters. To write strong recommendation letters, the author must know you well and be able to speak to your best qualities, strengths, and accomplishments. To help your referees, provide them with your transcripts, CV, personal statement, exam scores, and any other worthy achievements not included in your CV. You can find out everything you need to know about [medical school recommendation letters](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/medical-school-recommendation-letters) from our blog. What Should I Do if My Recommender Asks for a Draft of a Recommendation Letter? There is a chance that your recommender may ask you to provide a draft of a recommendation letter. Take this opportunity and present your candidacy in the best possible light! Make sure to read our blog [on how to write your own letter of recommendation](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/how-to-write-a-letter-of-recommendation-for-yourself) to get some tips. Also, make sure you mention that you can provide any information that they request about your other materials. Do I Need a Reference From a DO Physician if I'm Applying to DO School? Yes, absolutely. Remember, if you are applying to DO programs, make sure that you have at least one reference from a DO physician. The admissions committee must see that you are supported by osteopathic community, not simply MD professionals. Interviews I Got Invited to An Interview, Now What? Both DO and MD medical school programs have rigorous interview processes. To be invited for an interview for either program is a significant achievement. The logistics of an interview will vary by college, but you can start to prepare by practicing [common medical school interview questions](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/common-med-school-interview-questions). Remember, [how to prepare for your med school interview](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/how-to-prepare-for-med-school-interview) will depend on the interview format of the school to which you are applying. Try finding out what kind of interview format is used by your program of choice. These may include traditional interview, group interview, panel interview, hybrid interviews, and multiple mini interview. Check out our blog for lists of [MMI questions](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/sample-mmi-practice-questions) and [panel interview questions](https://medschoolinterviewquestions.com/panel-interview-questions.html) to get ready for your interview!

What Kind of Questions Can I Expect in an Interview for an Osteopathic School? For an [osteopathic medical school interview](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/osteopathic-med-school-interview), be prepared to articulate your interest in osteopathy and in the program by asking program-specific questions. Research and understand unique aspects of the program and relate them to your background and qualifications. Be sure to show your interviewer what you can bring to the programs' medical school community. You can also check out our blog of [sample questions to ask at medical school interview](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/when-the-tables-turn-15-sample-questions-to-ask-your-interviewer-in-a-med-school-interview). A quick note: if you are looking to send a [medical school letter of intent](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/medical-school-letter-of-intent) to your top-choice program a couple of months after your interview, whether it's DO or MD, you must first confirm that your chosen school accepts such letters. There are osteopathic and allopathic schools that do not welcome such letters and updates. If you would like to learn more about the qualities and competencies important in future physicians, make sure to familiarize yourself with [AAMC's core competencies](https://students-residents.aamc.org/applying-medical-school/article/core-competencies) and [qualities of a successful DO student](https://www.aacom.org/become-a-doctor/how-to-apply-to-osteopathic-medical-college/preparing-for-do-school/qualities-of-a-successful-do-student). DO vs MD: Tuition DO vs MD tuition costs are comparable. The difference in cost mostly depends on your residency status (in-state or out-of-state) and whether the school is private or public. Visit our blog if you want to learn more about American and Canadian [medical school tuition](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/medical-school-tuition) costs. Additionally, keep in mind all the other costs associated with medical schools, including application fees, interview costs, living costs, licensing costs, etc. If you would like to learn more about how much [medical school costs](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/medical-school-cost), be sure to read our blog. DO vs MD: Curriculum Differences How are Osteopathic and Allopathic Curricula the Same/Different? Osteopathic medical school curricula are similar to those in MD programs. Both programs take four years to complete. However, you must remember that each program varies by college. MD and DO programs provide training to prepare students for a variety of specialties such as family practice, internal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics/gynecology, psychiatry, radiology, preventative medicine, public health, and surgery. Just like allopathic medical schools, osteopathic medical schools expose their students to early clinical contact. While the first two years focus on the biomedical and clinical sciences, the second two years focus on patient-oriented clinical training. Most MD and DO programs also allow time for elective courses. What is the Framework for Clinical Experiences? Clinical education follows a distributive model in which students get to practice medicine in different health care settings. These include in-hospital experiences, as well as training in community hospitals and out-of-hospital ambulatory settings. Students in many DO programs are required to participate in community-based primary care rotations in rural or underserved areas. To get full information on each program's curriculum, be sure to check their webpages. How are Curriculums Formatted? Both MD and DO programs divide their four-year programs into pre-clerkship training and clerkships. Each school has its own course schedule and preferences, but the majority of MD and DO programs emphasize the basic and clinical sciences in the early years of the four-year programs. The first two years of MD and DO programs focus on medical foundations, anatomy, professional competencies, and learning clinical skills that prepare students for the last two years of clerkships. The table below represents a general guide to the disciplines and specialties that are covered by the osteopathic medical school curriculum. OMM What is OMM? The most distinguishing element of osteopathic medical education is the inclusion of osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM), a hands-on treatment that is used to diagnose and treat people in a primary or adjunctive way. This practice promises to enhance the overall health and holistic functioning of the human body. In conjunction with OMM, DO programs provide medical training in current and emerging theories and methods of medical treatment and diagnosis. DOs are also trained in all the other subjects expected of physicians along with the non-invasive skills of OMM. When is OMM Taught? OMM is a key component of DO education. OMM education usually occurs in the first and second years of theoretical and skills courses and throughout clinical training. Each student completes around 200 hours of OMM training. What Does the OMM Approach Help Achieve? DOs claim this hands-on treatment alleviates pain, helps diagnosis, restores motion, supports the body's natural structure, and helps it function more efficiently. The osteopathic medical approach believes that structure influences function. A problem in one part of the body can affect the function of that area and other areas of the body. For example, a problem in the ankle can cause painful symptoms in the knee, hip, spine, or cause symptoms in other seemingly unrelated parts of the body. OMM helps relieve the symptoms and helps to improve the functions of the whole body. Osteopathic medicine also promotes the idea that human bodies have innate abilities to heal themselves. Most OMM techniques aim to reduce invasive medical techniques and eliminate the impediments that prevent bodies to self-heal and function properly. Want to avoid medical school rejection? Watch our video: DO vs MD: Residency Differences DO vs MD Graduate Medical Education In the past, DO and MD students had separate graduate medical education accreditation systems. This kind of split also helped to propagate the rivalry between DO vs MD degrees. Today, a unified GME accreditation system is available to all medical school graduates under the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). Graduate programs previously accredited by the AOA (American Osteopathic Association) are now accredited by ACGME, which levels the playing field between DO and MD graduates. This unified GME accreditation system makes the application and participation process for DO graduates much easier than before. It gives osteopathic graduates opportunity to participate in many of the same programs as MDs. In this system, osteopathic medical graduates have the opportunity to pursue ACGME programs with osteopathic emphasis or programs with \"Osteopathic Recognition\" designation. Any ACGME program can apply for osteopathic recognition. These programs, which may be not osteopathic in their core, will be recognized as incorporating osteopathic principles and practices. Osteopathic Recognition is conferred upon a program, rather than its graduates. The program is required to formally designate which residents will receive a formal osteopathic education. It may choose to designate all or a portion of the residents as osteopaths, based in the graduates' interests and the ability to meet established matriculation requirements. So, the Osteopathic Recognition requirements will be only applied to designated residents. If MD residents choose to enter the ACGME-accredited osteopathic program, they may be required to satisfy additional prerequisite requirements. Prerequisite criteria may differ by program. Most DO and MD graduates focus on one field of practice in their graduate education. Due to osteopathic medicine's whole-person approach, the majority of DOs choose to practice medicine in the primary care specialties like family medicine, general internal medicine, and pediatrics. However, DO graduates practice a variety of medical specialists including geriatrics, sports medicine, and trauma surgery. Allopathic and osteopathic graduates have the following options: Residency Matching How Do MD and DO Graduates Apply to Residency Programs? Both MD and DO graduates use the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) to apply to their chosen residency programs. If you want to learn more about navigating the [ERAS application](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/eras-application-the-definitive-guide) system, check out our blog. Elected applicants are invited to interviews, where their candidacy will be assessed by the Program Director, faculty, and other residents. The interview is also the applicants' chance to examine the programs to which they applied. Based on the interviews, students submit a list of their choices, ranked from their first choice to last. Programs also rank the applicants. Based on these two lists, the residency match is made. How Do Match Rates Differ Between MDs and Dos? Whether you are applying to the [most competitive residencies](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/most-competitive-residencies) or not, residency matching is highly competitive for both MD and DO graduates. Osteopathic graduates have relatively high matching rates in GME programs; however, they are much lower than MDs' matching rates. According to the NRMP Main Residency Match, DO students experience lower success rates of matching compared to MD graduates for the majority of specialties. For example, even though DOs are competitive in primary care residencies where they have strong acceptance rates, they still have much lower acceptance rates than MDs. According to the latest statistics, in the state of New York, DO seniors matched 179 residency spots in internal medicine, while MD seniors matched 616 spots. The same trend can be observed in another primary care specialty, pediatrics. While 176 MDs matched in New York, only 46 DOs matched a residency in pediatrics. Check out the following match rates for DOs and MDs among 10 popular specialties: 10 Specialties DO seniors Match to: 1. Anaesthesiology Match 17.4% 10% 4. rate: 25.8% 5. Family medicine Match rate: 40.4% 6. Psychiatry Match rate: 18.9% 7. Internal medicine Match rate: 17.1% 8. rate: 19.7% 9. Diagnostic rate: 31.1% 10.

General surgery Match rate: 65.3% Will My Degree Be the Biggest Factor in Admissions Decisions? In general, your qualifications such as exam scores, research experience, grades, letters of recommendation, your [residency personal statement](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/residency-personal-statement-examples) and the impression you make in the residency interview will have much more impact on your chance to match to a desired program than your degree. However, it is important to be aware of the current conditions for matching. As it stands, DO graduates tend to have lower match statistics and are represented in less medical specialties. If you need help to get ready for your residency interview, visit our blog to go through [residency interview questions](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/the-five-residency-interview-questions-that-surprised-me) you absolutely need to know. DO vs MD: Licensing Differences Just like their MD peers, DO graduates go through a rigorous licensing process to ensure a high caliber of their theoretical and practical knowledge. To become a licensed allopathic or osteopathic physician, you must: Stay on top of medical developments related to your specialty through Continuing Medical Education (CME) programs. Participation in CMEs will provide ongoing education and retraining. As the medical field grows and develops new technologies and practices, you as a medical professional will need to improve your competencies. Each state has its own CME requirements. Licensing Exams United States Medical Licensure Examination (USLME) The USMLE is the standard examination required for all US and international MD students to practice medicine in the United States. DO students and residents are also eligible to take this exam. There are three parts to this exam: the [USMLE step 1](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/usmle-step-1), the [USMLE step 2 CK](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/usmle-step-2-ck), and the [USMLE step 3](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/usmle-step-3). Check your residency program's deadlines to see when you should schedule your USMLE exams. Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensure Exam (COMLEX-USA) COMLEX-USA is the standardized test of osteopathic medical skills. The goal of this exam is to test the competency of students' knowledge of osteopathic medical practice. This exam tests DOs' theoretical knowledge and essential clinical skills. COMLEX-USA consists of standardized test questions and a pass/fail observed clinical examination performed by the student. There are three COMLEX-USA components: Therefore, completing [COMLEX Level 1](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/comlex-level-1), [COMLEX Level 2 CE](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/comlex-level-2-ce) and [COMLEX Level 2 PE](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/comlex-level-2-pe) is required for graduation from the osteopathic school. Important note: some MD residency programs may accept COMLEX-USA exam scores, but most will require DO students to also take the USMLE exam in addition to COMLEX-USA. DO vs MD: Compensation Differences On average, there is a slight difference in salary between MD and DO physicians. Keep in mind that a doctor's salary is heavily influenced by his or her specialty, i.e. radiology, plastic surgery, cardiology, and so on. With this said, MD practitioners do earn a slightly higher salary on average, simply because more MDs are qualified for [higher-paid specialties](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/highest-paid-doctor) compared with DOs. Even though the majority of MDs end up in primary care specialties, MD graduates can earn higher salaries because they are more likely to go into highly competitive, lucrative specialties. DO graduates are not likely to do this. DOs tend to work in rural areas. They are less represented in specialties located in metropolitan areas, where the cost of living and average wages are much higher than in rural areas. DO vs MD initials do not influence the physician's salary directly, but your choice in specialty and place of work do - as I discussed, your choice in specialty may be limited if you're a DO. Want to know more about [how much residents make](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/how-much-do-residents-make) after MD and DO degrees? Check out our blog. It is interesting, and indeed informative to note that there is a strong correlation between the percentage of specialty residency positions filled by MD seniors and the average specialty salary. This correlation was not found in another [study](https://jamanetwork-com.ezproxy.snhu.edu/journals/jama/fullarticle/182526), for DO seniors. This might suggest that MD seniors take salary into consideration more than DO seniors or that DO seniors prioritize other factors in their residency applications, such as location or research opportunities. Here is a list of residency match data with salaries and positions filled by osteopathic and allopathic graduates: DO vs MD: Which Is Better? The choice is entirely up to you. Your preference will largely depend on your philosophical approach to theoretical training and clinical practice. In today's world, completing an MD degree is a more prestigious accomplishment. Out of two equal candidates with fitting credentials, MD graduates still have the upper hand over DOs in a job interview. DO degrees are often met with suspicion. Most people are less familiar with the DO curriculum and admission requirements. In reality, most people cannot tell the difference between MD and DO physicians' treatment. As DO degrees gain popularity and their graduates grow in number, the stigma will likely dissolve. It is important to remember that prestige is fleeting. Even if the current medical professional environment bestows more respect to MD degrees, that does not mean that your choice must be based on that seeming prestige. You must choose the path that is best suited to your worldview and your career aspirations. Do what makes you happy and be confident that you are doing the right thing. Ask yourself some important questions: - Do you agree with DO's philosophical tenets? Do you believe that body, mind, and soul are a unit? - Do you think focusing on treating the physical body is not a sufficient approach to healthcare? - Do you believe OMM is an appropriate method of patient treatment? Can you see yourself working with your hands to physically manipulate the body? - Do you want to live and practice in an urban center or a rural area? It is difficult to know what specialty you will want to practice when you are applying to medical school. Most students' interests change as they learn, which is normal. But beware, that your choice between DO and MD should also depend on the specialty you wish to pursue. As previously discussed, your choices in specialties may be more limited if your graduate with a DO. Keep in mind that highly competitive specialties and residency programs will require DO applicants to complete USMLE in addition to COMLEX-USA. FAQs 1.
