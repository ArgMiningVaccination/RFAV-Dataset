Ayurveda, or the \"science of life\" (Ayur = life, veda = science or knowledge) is one of the oldest medicinal systems in the world (5,000 years old!), and is lesser-known in the West than it's \"sister-science,\" yoga. Rooted in ancient wisdom, Ayurveda treats the whole body and the root cause of mind and body imbalances to promote optimal health, wellness, functioning and vitality. Ayurvedic herbs are powerful support systems for whole-body health, and the essential companion to your conscious lifestyle. Ayurveda is highly personalized. But, you don't have to travel all the way to India to experience the benefits of customized, medicinal-grade herbs! Our superstar herbs in our product -- Ashwagandha, Brahmi and Amalaki -- have been specially selected and dosed for a synergistic effect by an Ayurvedic physician. Designed for the modern-day conscious health warrior, we bring you a delicious taste of ancient wisdom. Want to take a step further into this ancient health system? Take our [Dosha Quiz](https://ayurvedicprotein.co/pages/ayurvedic-living) to discover your unique constitution and learn tips to achieve and maintain mind/body balance. Ayurvedic Protein\u00ae products were formulated to balance the doshic constitution according to Ayurveda (not sure what we're talking about? Take our [Dosha Quiz](https://ayurvedicprotein.co/pages/ayurvedic-living)!). Our products are for people over the age of 18. Please check if your health care provider before starting any new supplement. Consistency is key when consuming for therapeutic benefit. Herbs affect each person differently, but effects are typically experienced over 2-3 weeks of daily use. Some customers have reported immediate benefits. Consume 1 scoop of Ayurvedic Protein every day, whether that be for breakfast, after a workout, or as an afternoon snack. Enjoy up to 2 scoops per day. Go ahead - prepare Ayurvedic Protein however you'd like. The most commonly prepared use of protein powder is in a shake, simply mixed with milk or water. But, try this for a change: blend a scoop of protein with 1-2 cups of milk (we love it with rice or cashew milk!), and heat the mixture in a saucepan. According to Ayurveda, warm liquids help strengthen your digestive fire (agni) and enhance digestion and absorption of food and nutrients. Enjoy this yummy warm high-protein chai any time of day. You can also bake with it! We have recipes on our website under [\"Journal\"](https://ayurvedicprotein.co/blogs/news) and also on our social media (@ayurvedicprotein on Facebook, Instagram & Pinterest) Many people mix their protein shakes with fruit. According to Ayurveda, however, fruit is difficult to digest and should be eaten separately, and prior to other food. But don't let that stop you from making a full-blown meal-replacement smoothie: adding banana makes it creamier, greens adds vitamins. Make sure to consult a physician before mixing other herbs and supplements with Ayurvedic Protein. Ayurvedic Protein is manufactured in the USA at a cGMP-certified, FDA-registered facility. All ingredients are produced in the USA, with the exception of our herbs. We have partnered with the top herb growers in the USA who pride themselves in sustainably-sourced, fairly-traded organic herb crops. Their private USDA Certified Organic farms are located where the herbs grow natively (and the birthplace of Ayurveda): India. Absolutely! We take our product testing very seriously to ensure a superior quality product that surpasses other brands. Each individual ingredient in Ayurvedic Protein, as well as the final product of each batch, is tested for mold and heavy metals. Despite herbs being known to contain heavy metals, our herb manufacturers adhere to the strictest guidelines for growing, cultivating and testing their herbs. Every batch of herbs is tested for arsenic, cadmium, lead and mercury using independent U.S. laboratories. All of their products, when taken according to the suggested use, are within the safety guidelines stipulated by the American National Standards Institute/National Sanitation Foundation International Dietary Supplement Standard 173 (ANSI 173).

Ayurvedic Protein is Certified Gluten-Free, which means it meets the FDA's requirements of containing less than 20 parts per million of gluten, through third-party laboratory testing. Please consult with your healthcare physician about this product before consuming. Ayurvedic Protein is tested and free from the major 8 allergens. Please consult with your healthcare physician about this product before consuming. We have chosen to include the \"Prop 65\" reproductive health warning label on our packaging. The State of California requires a warning for any product sold in California that would result in a consumer ingesting more than 0.5 micrograms of lead in a day. This is an exceedingly low level that is, by law, 1000 times lower than the level of exposure that has been shown to have no observable effect on humans or animals. Therefore, the law sets an extremely stringent warning threshold. In fact, most whole herb and spice supplements (such as teas and adaptogenic herbs) have this Prop 65 warning on their label as well, or have chosen to only include this warning on the packaging sent sold to California citizens. Many herbs contain very low levels of lead, an element that can be found commonly or naturally in soil, plants, and water, that may trigger the requirement to warn. Rather than limiting our customers' access to whole herb products in California - and reduce their healing effects - we have chosen to issue the warning specified under Proposition 65. All of our herbs that we source test well within the internationally accepted safety standards for dietary supplements (ANSI 173). We source our herbs from an extremely well-trusted and respected company that uses dried whole herbs grown in nature. This company does not intentionally add any lead to any of its products. "}
