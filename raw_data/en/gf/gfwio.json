She is double board certified in Internal Medicine and Integrative Medicine, and certified in Anthroposophic Medicine.

Dr. Iancu has been practicing medicine for 25 years and has worked in hospitals, ICUs, hospice, nursing homes and primary care. In 2004 she was one of the first doctors to become certified in Holistic Medicine. She has also studied acupuncture, Functional Medicine, Chi Nei Tsang, Reiki, and Energy and Intuitive Healing modalities. In 2014 Dr. Iancu discovered Anthroposophic Medicine, a comprehensive medicine model that, in addition to the physical body, considers the energetic, emotional, and spiritual aspects of the human being. After 18 years of working for a large HMO, Dr Daci started her own private practice in 2018, where she can provide personalized care in a slow, intimate setting, using multiple modalities. \"My life work has been devoted to understanding the subtleties of health and healing and to helping individuals heal from the inside out. I bring to my encounter with each patient an open-minded, individualized approach where I try to understand another human being's struggles and victories. I use my intuition combined with years of studies and experience to provide support and guidance. I view the patient-doctor relationship as a sacred partnership, where both parties are continually growing and learning from each other. Sometimes illness can present an opportunity for growth.\" Education Other Training and Certification Sign up to hear from us about specials, sales, and events. \"When we bring body, soul, and spirit into harmony, we make our peace with destiny: we have learned to accept and love it.
