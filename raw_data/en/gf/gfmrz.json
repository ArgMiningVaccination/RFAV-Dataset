Become anutritionist in a two-yearmaster's program There's increasing demand for nutrition professionals who understand how diet can be a powerful tool for treating disease and increasing wellness. In the U.S., many in this growing group of professionals are nutritionists. As clinicians, health coaches, advisors and educators, nutritionists take a whole-systems approach to food and health. Working one-on-one with patients, nutritionists use diet to impact chronic conditions like autoimmune disorders and diabetes. They also work to increase the health of food systems by creating nutrition education programs, evolving regenerative farming practices, and developing therapeutic menus. Whatever their career path, nutritionists share a common goal: to help people find their own path to better health with whole-systems nutrition. At NUNM, we believe food is medicine The Master of Science in Nutrition program at NUNM was founded by naturopathic doctors rooted in the philosophy that food is medicine, and what we eat has a profound effect on health. Understanding the science behind the most fundamental building blocks of our diet, nutritionists have the power to address chronic disease and wellness for individuals and communities. The onlyMaster of Sciencein Nutrition program with a \"kitchen-first\" approach At NUNM, we believe the best nutrition professionals relate everything back to food. Food is more than just vitamins, proteins and calories. Food can be emotional connection, cultural exchange, environmental engine and personal empowerment. While few people connect deeply with nutrients, everyone interacts daily with food. With food-first skills, nutritionists are better able to meet patients and communities where they are and guide them to better health outcomes. Each layer of your classwork deepens your connection with food, from the seed to the plate. From hands-on classes with organic farms and regenerative farmers, to recipe creation in our on-campus teaching kitchen. Nutrition science foreach individual Nutrition science is constantly evolving as evidence shows that individuals respond to foods in vastly different ways. At NUNM, you'll study a rigorous scientific foundation in the physiology of nutrition and learn to thoughtfully evaluate new studies and emerging research. We'll teach you how to sift through the overwhelming number of viewpoints on nutrition and find the best solutions for patients and communities. Since people respond to food in different ways, we center our education on developing individualized diets that consider each person's unique biology, cultural traditions and access to food. Foodand physiology arejust the beginningsof whole-systemsnutrition Our curriculum widens the lens on nutrition to give students a more nuanced perspective on eating and health. With curriculum focusing on four key areas, we empower our graduates to view each patient and community in a truly holistic way. Clinical nutrition. Clinical nutrition is evidence-based, personalized nutrition care for all nutrition-related conditions, including seven of America's leading causes of chronic illness and death: Alzheimer's disease, cancer, chronic lower respiratory diseases like asthma and COPD, diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, and stroke. The clinical nutrition practice is integrative, using biomarkers (biological markers) to diagnose nutrition-related problems and manage health outcomes, and food as medicine to provide for the individual's total health and well-being. NUNM teaches the nutritionist how to deliver nutrition services in a clinical setting, providing direct client/patient care to diagnose, manage, cure, and prevent nutrition-related problems with nutrition-focused therapies and lifestyle modifications that are respectful of, and responsive to, an individual's preferences and values. Community nutrition. Learn population-based nutrition and determinants of health, such as food access, education and policy. Also explore economic, cultural and social influences on nutrition. Culinary nutrition. Learn the principles and application of food preparation in the teaching kitchen. Develop recipes and menus to support health. Environmental nutrition. Learn the landscape of local and global food systems, paying specific attention to organic and sustainable practices. Follow the seed-to-table journey, exploring the relationship between food production and utilization, while considering environmental, social and economic facilitators and barriers of designing healthy communities. Qualify as aCertified Nutrition Specialist (CNS) We believe that food is medicine and that each person should be seen as an individual when it comes to food. So, we've created a program that fulfills the academic requirements to become a Certified Nutrition Specialist (CNS). The Board for Certification of Nutrition Specialists evaluates each CNS candidate against a rigorous set of skills and competencies to determine eligibility, and is broadly recognized nationally for those wishing to practice in a clinical setting. We believe being a CNS allows our graduates to practice nutrition in a more holistic, empathetic way. Postgraduate Clinical Nutrition Internship Our six-month internship runs annually from July - December and provides CNS-approved Supervised Practice Experience (SPE) to prepare you for the Certified Nutrition Specialist\u00ae (CNS) credential. The CNS credential is a pathway to state licensure in Oregon and other states. Postgraduate interns deliver in-person and telemedicine nutrition services with experienced clinicians, gaining real-world practice experience and working with faculty mentors dedicated to developing professional skills, including nutrition-focused physical examination procedures, creating personalized nutrition care plans, health coaching, and nutritional counseling for individuals and groups. Make the most of your nutrition degree! Space is limited to 8 participants (must be located in Oregon). Learn more We prepare youfor asuccessfulcareer helpingpeople becomeholisticallyhealthy Our curriculum helps you navigate the broad and dynamic field of nutrition with real-world experiences and skills. In your final year of the program, you'll develop a capstone project with guidance from an experienced industry mentor to build your resume in your area of interest. This process helps students refine their career direction and network within their chosen field. Some example capstone projects: A student implemented a healthier version of the free breakfast program at a local elementary school. A group of students created a plan to reforest urban and suburban centers to relieve food insecurity and mitigate poverty, and created a test project on NUNM's campus. Two students worked together to create a cookbook inspired by the Pacific Northwest. A student worked to assess food security and sovereignty within the urban Native American community. Additionally, nutrition students have the opportunity to see patients in our on-campus teaching clinic and learn the medical record-keeping system Epic. This gives our students who wish to go into clinical practice a true advantage in the market. Wondering what your career after NUNM could look like? As a Kauai, 'ina-based educator, farm-to-school advocate and nutritionist, Tiana Kamen wants all children to have access to healthy foods, a garden, and nutrition and environmental education. She pioneered two farm-to-school programs, Farm to Keiki (a farm-to-preschool program) and the Kauai School Garden Network. She's also written a book to empower early childhood programs and families with young children throughout Hawaii to teach about local, healthy food. Recognized by the Hawaii Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, her book and training program, Farm to Keiki, have reached hundreds of early childhood educators in Hawaii. We do! Our Financial Aid office can help determine your eligibility for financial aid and provide you with resources to accomplish your educational goals. Are you accredited? NUNM is accredited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU). Learn more about our accreditation and see our NWCCU evaluation reports. What is the difference between a clinical nutritionist and a registered dietitian? The clinical nutritionist can be a physician or non-physician with an accredited master's degree in clinical nutrition. The Certified Nutrition Specialist (CNS) credential (obtained separately) is accepted for licensure of the non-physician nutritionist in many states to practice clinical nutrition. NUNM's Master of Science in Nutrition program provides the prerequisites and a post-graduate supervised practice pathway to qualify for the CNS examination. The dietitian is a non-physician with an accredited bachelor's degree in clinical nutrition, dietetics, foods and nutrition or public health nutrition. After completing a dietetic internship (DI), Coordinated Program (CP) or Individualized Supervised Practice Pathway (ISPP) and passing the Commission on Dietetic Registration (CDR) exam, the dietitian becomes a Registered Dietitian (RD) and obtains a state license to practice medical nutrition therapy. As of 2024, dietitians must also earn a master's or doctoral degree in any field of study to be eligible to sit for the CDR exam. Do you teach vegan diets? What about paleo or keto diets? Orintermittentfasting? Yes and no. Our curriculum is grounded in individualized nutrition and whole foods. So, while yes, you'll learn the components of healthy plant-based nutrition and other food philosophies, you'll also learn that specialized diets might not be the best choice for your patient or the community you serve.
