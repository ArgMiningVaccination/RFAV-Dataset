Because the vaccine -targeted diseases are less common, it is more difficult for people to compare the risks of these diseases to the risks of adverse events following immunization. Public and mass media concern has shifted to vaccine safety. A higher standard of safety is generally expected of vaccines compared to other medical interventions. As vaccines are give n to healthy people, especially infants and children, there is a low tolerance for adverse events. It is the responsibility of the health care provider to communicate effectively with parents and individuals regarding the benefits and risks of immunizatio n. Principles of Benefit/Risk Communication Communicate current knowledge, taking into account what an individual already knows and the level of detail requested. Provide a variety of information formats (e.g., visual, audio, printed material, and websit es). Provide guidance on how to assess website reliability. Respect differences of opinion about immunization. When an individual expresses reluctance or refusal to immunize themselves or their children, assess both the strength of their beliefs and the underlying reasons for their beliefs and actions. Represent the benefits and risks of vaccines fairly and openly. Compare the known and theoretical risks of a vaccine with the known risks associated with the vaccine preventable infection. (Refer to Table 1: Relative Risks of Disease s and Immunization ). Remind clients that vaccine preventable diseases have not been eliminated. Adopt a client centered approach. Effective decision making is best done in partnership between the health care provider and the parent or client. Make the most of each opportunity to present clear, evidence -based messages regarding vaccines and immunizations. Encourage questions and discussion, address misinformation, and provide valid and appropriate resources, including appropriate websites, for those who want more information. The Immunization Communication Tool for Immunizers assists providers in addressing many of the questions and concerns parents may have regarding immunization. Communicable Disease Control Manual May 2009 Chapter 2: Immunization Supporting Documents - Relative Risks of Diseases and Immunization 2 Consider the following websites when communicating with parents regarding immunization. Webs ites listed include information for both health professionals and parents, and include links to other reliable sources of information. ImmunizeBC HealthLinkBC Files Public Health Agency of Canada, Immunization and Vaccines Immunize Canada Canadian Immunization Guide Canadian Pediatric Societ y Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Vaccine Education Center Immunization Action Coalition National Network for Immunization Information . Information for health professionals and parents (includes information regarding assessing webs ite quality and reliability). World Health Organization (lists websites with information related to vaccine safety that meets criteria related to credibility, content, accessibility, and design). Dr. Paul Offit and colleagues have published 3 articles directly related to parent's concerns regarding immunization: Addressing Parents' Concerns: Do Vaccines Preservatives, Adjuvants, Additives, or Residuals? Addressing Parents' Concerns: Do Multiple Vaccines Overwhelm or Weaken the Infant's Immune System? Addressing Parents' Concerns: Do Vaccines Cause Allergic or Autoimmune Diseases?
