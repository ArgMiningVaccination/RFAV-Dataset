These wall drawings and paintings show people massaging each other. Various artifacts also found contain traces of fats and oils mixed with herbs. These indicate that lubricants may have been used, perhaps for healing, soothing or beautifying purposes. As early as 3000 BC, the Chinese practiced massage to cure ailments and improve general health. Records of this can be found in the British Museum. Ancient Chinese books record lists of massage movements with descriptions of their technique. One of these books, The Cong Fauof Tao-Tse, also contains lists of exercises and massage used to improve general health and well-being. The Chinese found that pressure techniques were very effective on specific points and they developed special techniques called amma . This was the beginning of the development of acupressure and acupuncture. These massage techniques spread to Japan, where they were further developed. The Japanese used similar pressure techniques on specific points, which they called tsubo. This form of massage has been practiced over the centuries; it has recently regained recognition and popularity and is now known as shiatsu. Many therapists have studied these techniques, which they combine with other forms of treatment for the benefit of their clients. Records show that the Hindus practiced massage as part of their hygiene routines. A sacred book called the Ayur-Veda (The Art of Life), which was written around 1800 BC, describes how shampooing and rubbing were used to reduce fatigue and promote well- being and cleanliness. The Egyptians and Persians used massage for cosmetic as well as therapeutic effects . They mixed fats, oils, herbs and resins for care of the skin and beautifying the body and face. Pots and jars containing these creams have been found in Egyptian tombs. Cleopatra is said to have bathed in milk and then to have been massaged with aromatic oils and creams by her handmaidens. The practice of massage spread from the east into Europe, where it was well established by 500 BC. Massage in Classical Greece and Rome The Greeks believed in the cultivation of a healthy mind and body, which is similar to the holistic approach' practised by many people today. Rituals of bathing, massage, exercise or dancing were practised by men and women. They encouraged the pursuit of physical fitness and organised regular sporting, gymnastic and athletic competitions. Massage was used before events to improve performance and after events to relieve fatigue and aid recovery. Gladiators and soldiers were massaged before battle to give vigour and promote fitness and health, and afterwards to aid recovery, healing and relaxation. Homer writes in the poem The Odyssey of Greek soldiers being rubbed with oils and anointed by beautiful women to aid their recovery and regain strength on return from battle. Around 500 BC the Greek physician Herodicus used massage with oils and herbs to treat medical conditions and diseases. Hippocrates, who is now thought of as the father of medicine,was a pupil of Herodicus. He began to study the effects of massage on his patients. He concluded and recorded that hard rubbing binds, soft rubbing loosens, much rubbing causes parts to waste but moderate rubbing makes them grow'. Hippocrates also concluded that it was more beneficial to apply pressure in an upward direction, i.e. towards the heart, as we practise today. In Hippocrates' day, the function of the heart and the circulation of the blood were not known. It is therefore remarkable that he reached this conclusion only by observing the effect on the tissues of different strokes. With our knowledge of the heart and circulating blood we understand why pressure upwards is more beneficial: the condition of the tissues improves because deoxygenated blood and waste products are removed quickly as massage speeds up blood and lymph flow. Even without the benefit of this knowledge, Hippocrates taught his pupils that massage movements should be performed with pressure upwards to promote healing. The Romans followed similar routines to the Greeks. They practised bathing, exercise andmassage for health and social relaxation. Large private and public baths were built. Theseincluded water baths and steam rooms, gymnasium and massage areas. The baths weremaintained at different temperatures and progress was made from cold to hot baths. Wealthy Romans would use these daily for cleansing, exercising, relaxing and socialising. Servants werealways in attendance, with oils and creams to massage their masters when required. TheRomans built similar baths in the countries that were conquered by their armies. Many suchbaths were built after the Roman conquest of Britain in 55 BC, and their ruins can be seen in Britain today in towns and cities such as Bath, Caerleon and St Albans. Massage techniquesrecorded from those times include manipulations known as squeezing, pinching orpummelling. They relate to the petrissage and percussion movements used today. The Dark Ages to the Renaissance Little is known about massage or health and beauty practices throughout the Dark and Middle Ages, i.e. from the decline of the Roman Empire around 500 AD until the Middle Ages around 1400 AD. Few records remain from those days of wars, strict religions, superstition and persecution. Little value was placed on education, the arts, physical health and fitness. Following this period came the Renaissance (rebirth) in 1450 AD. Interest in the arts and sciences flourished and there was renewed interest in health practices. Once again we see massage advocated and practiced for therapeutic purposes. In the sixteenth century, the French surgeon Ambroise Par\u00e9 (1517-90) promoted and developed the use of massage. He was the personal physician to four French kings. He is reputed to have successfully treated Mary Queen of Scots with massage. Par\u00e9 graded massage into gentle, medium and vigorous. We use similar categories today, namely soothing or relaxing, general, and stimulating. Many other physicians copied his methods and massage was established medically. The Development of Modern Massage Techniques Modern massage techniques have evolved mainly from a system developed by a Swedish physiologist called Per Henrik Ling (1776-1839). He developed a system of passive and active exercises known as 'Swedish Remedial Gymnastics' and also a system of terms 'effleurage', 'petrissage', 'vibration', 'friction', 'rolling' and 'slapping'. Most of these terms are still used today, but some changes and End of preview Want to read all 3 pages? Upload your study docs or become a member. "}
