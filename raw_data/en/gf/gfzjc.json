Does it work? And what happens to toxicity, especially where targeted agents are added? Clifford Hudis takes a look at the evidence in early breast cancer. Why escalate the dose of cancer therapies? The rationale is that escalating the dose should kill more cancer cells. This has been seen many times in preclinical models in laboratory experiments and sometimes in the clinic, but not consis - tently. For example, two large, ran - domised trials, including a total of nearly five thousand patients in the NSABP (National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project) in the US showed no effect of escalated doses of cyclophos - phamide on outcomes. These trials tested five dose levels, where the dose was dou - bled in dose size, doubled in dose expo - sure, doubled in dose size again, and doubled in total exposure again, so that doses ranged from 600 mg/m 2 every three weeks to four times greater (see figure, p14 top ). Results showed no impact on either disease-free or overall survival across these two sequential studies. Previous results, such as those from Budman et al. (CALGB 8541) suggest that there could be a dose- response relationship for cyclophos - phamide, but only at lower doses; the NSABP data show that this does not The European School of Oncology pres - ents weekly e-grandrounds which offer participants the opportunity to discuss a range of cutting-edge issues, from con - troversial areas and the latest scientific developments to challenging clinical cases, with leading European experts in the field. One of these is selected for pub - lication in each issue of Cancer World . In this issue, Clifford Hudis, from Memo - rial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, provides an update on optimising dose-dense regimens for women with early breast cancer. This is based on a News and Views article in Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology (2010, 7:678 -679). Fatima Cardoso, from Champalimaud Cancer Centre, in Lisbon, Portugal, poses questions arising during the e-grandround live presentation. It as summarised by Susan Mayor. The recorded version of this and other e-grandrounds, together with 15 minutes of discussion, is available at www.e-eso.net continue at higher doses. We have seen similar results for anthracy - clines and taxanes and most other chemotherapy drugs. In optimising chemotherapy reg - imens with regard to dose and sched - ule, there are essentially two aspects to consider. On the one hand there is the Gompertzian growth kinetics of breast cancer cells, as is true for all other solid tumours, and indeed all cell and tissue types. The tumour, while always growing, appears to have a decreasing rate of growth over time. This is not actually true when you look at raw numbers, but it is true when you look at volumes. That is because of the effect of three dimensions in minimising the per - ception of volume change. It is also a reflection of the balance (or imbal - ance) between cell division and cell death as it changes with tumour growth, perhaps due to alterations in the delivery of nutrients and other factors. If we administer chemotherapy based on the Skipper-Schabel model (see figure, bottom right ), the green arrows indicate the further reduction with each dose of chemotherapy, which we have always been taught is a log kill effect. The black arrows show the result of shortening the time between treatments on the log kill effect, which is what we call dose density. More frequent (dense) dosing decreases the time for tumour regrowth in between doses. It allows for the treatment each successive time of an ever smaller vol - ume of tumour and that, in turn, results in a greater overall cell-kill. ISTHE LOG CELL -KILL MODEL REFLECTED IN THE CLINIC ? A study from Milan (see p 15 top ) explored sequential or alternating treatment with CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrex - ate, 5-fluorouracil) (in yellow) and dox - orubicin (in red). The theory was that alternating these non-cross-resistant treat -ments would yield greater cell-kill. That is the arm represented by the top row of the figure. As a control, they administered the same four doses of the doxorubicin first, followed by the same total eight doses of CMF sequentially. Over the nine months of treatment, every patient on this study received the same four drugs, CMF and doxorubicin, with the same size doses of each drug and the same total dose of each drug. This emerges as an elegant test of dose density. The results speak for themselves, favouring the dose-dense regimen. Janice Gabrilove and colleagues, at my institution, first used growth factors -specifically granulocyte colony-stim - ulating factor (G-CSF), also known as fil - grastim - to reduce neutropenia and associated morbidity due to chemother - apy in patients with bladder cancer. Although they gave full chemotherapy at a standard interval, all of the patients (100%) had full recovery of blood counts by day 14, and would have been able to receive planned chemotherapy, com - pared to only 29% of those not given 14 I CANCER WORLD I JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2012 e-Grand Round G-CSF ( NEJM 1988; 318:1414-22). As investigators were beginning to explore significant dose escalation, based on the hypothesis that the dose-response relationship was linear, we instead went in a different direction and began to explore dose density, meaning shortening of the intervals between treatments. The figure on page 15 ( bottom ) sum - marises three sequential pilot studies at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). First, we were able to give high-dose cyclophosphamide (a very high dose of 3.0 g/m 2) at two-week inter - vals with growth factor support. The second study added paclitaxel, in one of the first trials to add this, or any, taxane as adjuvant therapy (the ATC regimen - Adriamycin (doxorubicin), Taxol (pacli - taxel), Cyclophosphamide). In this study the dose interval for doxorubicin was shortened - we gave three doses of each of the three drugs, all at two-week inter - vals and demonstrated feasibility, albeit with significant toxicities attributable to the use of higher doses of the individual agents than are currently employed. Later, in a third study, we randomised IMPACT OF MORE FREQUENT DOSING 10 12 10 8 10 4 10 0 0 20 40 60 WeeksCell Number A prediction of the Skipper-Schabel model of log cell-kill is that more frequent (denser) dosing gives the remaining cells less time to regrow between doses, allowing treatment of a smaller volume, which then results in greater overall cell-kill CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE DOSE ESCALATION 600 1200 % 77% 61 % 78% 64 % 77% 66 % 79% Increasing the total amount of cyclophosphamide used in adjuvant treatment from 600 mg/m 2to four times that amount had no effect on outcomes in these two large NSABP trials Sources: BS Fisher et al.

(1999) JCO 17:3374-88 epirubicin, paclitaxel and cyclophos - phamide (ETC), given with growth factor support, was superior in long-term follow- up to the conventional epirubicin/ cyclophosphamide men ( abstr 513). How - ever, the number of doses of the three drugs varies and the size of the doses varies, as well as the dosing interval. Hence, while this study clearly demon - strated the superiority of a dose-dense reg - imen, critics could claim that this was due to other factors, such as the larger doses of the individual drugs. Weekly paclitaxel has been called \"dose-dense\" by us and others. How - ever, here again there can be confusion patients to concurrent or sequential ther - apy with paclitaxel and cyclophos - phamide, but all drugs were given in a dose-dense regimen. This study demon - strated that with these high doses, the concurrent regimen was no better in terms of toxicity. These studies were all too small (or non-randomised) to allow for efficacy comparisons. As one considers the results of trials that employ dose-dense regimens, it is important to be wary of possible con - founders that can compromise the inter - pretation of such studies. For example, while we can achieve a dose-dense reg - imen with short intervals, testing it requires carefully controlled studies. Comparing four cycles of low-dose ver - sus high-dose chemotherapy tests dose size. Comparing four cycles of a drug ver - sus six cycles of the same size dose tests number of doses, and also tests total drug exposure, but not density. Control - ling dose size but changing the frequency of administration - or density - while controlling the total dose number, is a pure test of dose density. A typical design - and I have taken part in these studies myself - is four cycles of low-dose chemotherapy over three-week intervals, compared to three cycles of higher-dose every two weeks. This changes several parameters so it is not always clear what is being tested. One example of a positive study was the AGO (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Gynaekologische Onkologie) trial (see p16, top ). Here, a dose-dense regimen of in terms of what is tested in clinical trials. In the ECOG 1199 (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) study, AC was given at three-week intervals, followed by one of two taxanes - pacli - taxel or docetaxel - using one of two schedules: weekly or three-weekly (q3). Weekly paclitaxel appeared to be supe - rior q3 paclitaxel. However, we note that 80 mg/m 2weekly of paclitaxel for 12 weeks is not the same as 175 mg/m 2 q3, and so there are multiple variables at work here: dose number, dose size and frequency of administration. The Cancer and Leukemia Group B dose-density trial CALGB 97-41 also employed a factorial design (see p 16, bottom ). We asked two questions: the first question was about the frequency of administration, comparing q2 therapy with G-CSF support to q3; the second compared concurrent AC therapy with sequential therapy. What makes this study interpretable for us is that every patient had the same four doses of the same three drugs. All that varies across the four treatment assignments is concurrent or sequential dosing, and dose density. Results show that q2 therapy was superior to q3 for disease-free survival; this was also true for overall survival. There was no difference between sequential and concurrent therapy. We continue to use concurrent therapy most of the time because it allows us to get the treatment completed faster. But that is not the same as saying it is better, other than in terms of convenience. TOXICITY Once one accepts the superior efficacy of dose-dense treatment, the next con - cern is toxicity. This has become a par - ticular issue in an era of trastuzumab and HER2-directed therapies for patients with HER2-positive disease. The cardiotoxicity results from CALGB 97-41 showed the only acute cardiac event occurred in the patient e-Grand Round CANCER WORLD I JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2012 I 15 MSKCC DOSE-DENSE PILOT TRIALS early trials conducted at Memorial Sloan- Kettering Cancer Center tested the feasibility of increasing the frequency of dosing in terms of toxicity (numbers down the left-hand side indicate the year of the trial followed by its serial number) SEQUENTIAL OR ALTERNATING By showing that alternating non-cross-resistant treatments gave inferior results than using them sequentially, this Milan trial provided evidence to support the principal of denser dosing Source: G Bonadonna et al. (1995) JAMA 273 :542-547 you would have least expected: one treated with q3 single-agent doxorubicin. Looking at the total number of cardiac events -although this was purely exploratory and done retrospectively - showed that numerically there were twice as many events with q3 therapy as with q2 (2.5% vs 1.5%). This gave us some comfort that dose-dense therapy does not raise the risk of cardiac toxicity compared to q3. This allowed us to go forward with pilot studies of dose-dense therapy and trastuzumab and also bevacizumab. The tables opposite show three studies of dose-dense AC with targeted therapy done by our group at MSKCC, and col - leagues at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF), and the Dana- Farber Cancer Institute. The right-hand table summarises the cardiac toxicities, showing essentially no signal of acute cardiac toxicity over the four doses of AC across the several hundred patients. Longer term follow-up does not show any clear signal that dose density repre - sents a special challenge for the delivery of full doses and durations of these regimens ( JCO 2009, 27:6117-23). For comparison, in the cooperative group trials, about 65% of patients finished their full year of trastuzumab, whereas this number was about 80% in our studies. TAKING DOSE -DENSE THERAPY FORWARD We incorporated the results of CALGB 97-41 into CALGB 40101. Ini - tially this was a study of weekly paclitaxel for 12 or 18 weeks, versus AC q3 for four or six cycles with G-CSF. It was a two- by-two factorial design, comparing AC against single-agent paclitaxel for low- risk breast cancer. It was also a compar - ison of a longer therapy (six months) versus shorter (four months). There were those who argued that the superiority of AC followed by paclitaxel (or docetaxel) was not really attributable to taxanes per se but instead to the eight cycles of treatment which were presumed to be superior to four. Others have argued that six cycles of AC-containing therapy is better than four. Based on the results of CALGB 97-41 we were motivated to change the study. With fewer than six hundred patients recruited, we modified it to include dose-dense therapy (q2 administration) and six cycles versus four. We continued the AC versus paclitaxel randomisation. In a still later modifica - tion of the study we dropped the six versus 16 I CANCER WORLD I JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2012 e-Grand Round THE AGO TRIAL: ETC VS EC T IN PATIENTS WITH 4+ LYMPH NODES Epirubicin Paclitaxel Cyclophosphamide mg/m q3w x 4 R 0 12 24 36 48 60 Months 0.00.20.40.60.81.0Rate without progression ETC n = 590, 94 events EC -> T n = 554, 127 events Logrank test, p = 0.0009, two-sided The more dose-dense regimen, which also included higher dose levels, gave superior results in the study by the German Arbeitsgemeinschaft Gynaekologische Onkologie q2w, q3w - every two weeks, VJ M\u00f6bus et al.

We do not yet have the results of the AC versus paclitaxel com - parison, but our data and safety moni - toring board confirmed that they do not confound our results. ISTHERE ABETTER AC OR PACLITAXEL SCHEDULE ? SWOG study S0221 used a two-by- two factorial design of six cycles of dose-dense AC compared to a regimen of low-dose weekly doxorubicin regi - men along with oral daily cyclophos - phamide. Apart from that randomised comparison, they compared q2 pacli - taxel for six cycles versus low-dose weekly paclitaxel for 12 weeks. gemcitabine as a fourth chemotherapy drug is going to add to this cohort of patients is unlikely to be supported. CAN WE FURTHER DECREASE INTERVALS AND INCREASE DOSE DENSITY ? The ECOG 5103 bevacizumab trial is comparing AC, followed by weekly paclitaxel alone, with AC plus beva - cizumab followed by paclitaxel plus bevacizumab, or AC followed by pacli - taxel, both with bevacizumab and then followed by bevacizumab (see p 18, bottom ). If bevacizumab adds a benefit, this study also allows us to ask about the duration of its use. Because clini - cians have different views on the appro - priateness of dose-dense therapy, the dose-dense regimen is allowed, as is q3 administration, and the patients were simply stratified on that basis. Our group has gone ahead asking whether we can push this further. The first pilot study, conducted by Monica Bevaciz x 52wTrastuz +Lapat x 52wTrastuz x 52w Recently, they dropped the AC portion of the randomisation and shortened it to four cycles of every other week dosing. This was based on a futility analysis that weekly doxorubicin and oral cyclophosphamide could never be superior to the six cycles of AC. It does not mean it is worse. Hence the sim - plified design is now four doses of q2 AC, and the taxane comparison of low- dose weekly paclitaxel versus higher- dose q2 continues. The NSAPB B-38 trial (see p 18, top ) compares dose-dense AC pacli - taxel ( middle row Taxotere [docetaxel], Adriamycin [dox - orubicin], paclitaxel with gemcitabine ( bottom row ). The tAnGo study, a UK-based trial that looked at the potential benefits of adding gemcitabine to an anthracycline- and taxane-containing adjuvant treatment regimen in early breast cancer, was neg - ative. This suggests that the notion that e-Grand Round CANCER WORLD I JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2012 I 17 TARGETED AGENTS WITH DOSE-DENSE AC: TOO TOXIC? Three studies conducted at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center showed that dose-dense AC (doxorubicin+cyclophosphamide) can safely be used even with targeted therapies that are associated with cardiac toxicity, such as trastuzumab (T), lapatinib (L) and bevacizumab (B) P - - left ventricular ejection fraction; Sx'ic CHF - symptomatic congestive heart failure.

Instead, our goal is to use the least toxic therapy that we can. Capecitabine has high efficacy but also toxicity; giving the drug continu - ously for 14 days on a 21-day cycle results in a high rate of diarrhoea and gastrointestinal distress in the second week. We looked at mouse models of a capecitabine-sensitive tumour cell line. The maximal impact of therapy occurred eight days after starting treat - ment. This means that each day after that time point, if we continued to dose with capecitabine, cell-kill still occurred but it was less than the day before. The downside is that the toxicities accu - mulate so a week off is still needed to recover. We modelled the impact of a dose-dense schedule, which consists of one week on and one week off and this predicted that stopping therapy earlier, at one week, would allow for the earlier imposition of the needed seven- day break, but then an earlier re-initia - tion of treatment with resumption of greater cell-kill. In the clinical extension of this work, our phase I study showed that this was feasible, and we have now done phase II studies with weekly (one week on, one week off) capecitabine combined with lapatinib or with bevacizumab, all of which have been feasible. This schedule has been widely adopted by clinicians because, as a practical matter, they so often have to stop before 14 days because of toxicity. This is a demon - stration of the way in which a dose- dense schedule can be advantageous in the palliative setting as well as more curative in the adjuvant setting. CONCLUSION Dose scheduling - specifically in terms of density - is important, and it should be maintained in the adjuvant setting for both efficacy and toxicity. For example, using growth factor sup - port with dose-dense AC not only Fornier, looked at 10- to 11-day intervals with sequential EC and paclitaxel using conventional G-CSF, because you can - not use pegylated G-CSF with such a short interval. The study demonstrated that this was feasible, but a randomised trial would be needed to show efficacy. We then turned our attention to intra - venous CMF, which was given two weeks on and two weeks off in the Milan stud - ies in the past. Here we gave it every 14 days without breaks, which modelled the dose-dense experience of the CALGB. All we wanted to demonstrate was that it was feasible, because there are clinical reasons, from time to time in individual patients, to try to accelerate CMF, and when we treat patients in the low-risk set - ting this can be a viable alternative. For this not to be justifiable, we would have to show that shortening the interval makes the therapy less effective, but we have never seen evidence of that. Feasibility was strained at intervals of 10 -11 days but not at 14 days. DOSE -DENSE TREATMENT IN THE PALLIATIVE SETTING Typically, we do not do stud - ies of dose density in the pal - liative setting, because our goal here is not necessarily to achieve the highest response R ANDOMISE1:2:2 Arm B: BAC >BT Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2/wk x plus Bevacizumab x 4 Arm A: AC >T AC + plus Placebo x 4 Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2/wk x 12 Plus Placebo Arm C: BAC >BT >B DAll arms. unblinded on C8D1 REGISTER 18 I AC->PGq3 AC study aims to find out whether dose- dense doxorubicin+cyclophosphamide (AC) followed by paclitaxel with or without gemcitabine gives better results than three- weekly docetaxel+doxorubicin+ cyclophosphamide (TAC) ECOG 5103 This study is looking at the impact of adding various schedules of bevacizumab to an AC T regimen; investigators can choose between standard (three- weekly) or dose-dense (two- weekly) AC dose frequency C8D1 - cycle 8 day 1 enhances efficacy but also halves the hospitalisation rate (typically due to neutropenic fever). At the same time, it is fair to say that the cost issue is not fully addressed. Growth factor support is not inexpensive and the cost varies widely, making it unlikely that we will ever be able to develop an absolute answer on this issue. Cost- effectiveness in the curative setting depends, in part, on how much value is put on lives saved. Finally, supportive care, in the form of growth factor use, is what facilitates the improved chemotherapy effect, so that is a critical part of the story. As we move further into the era of molecu - larly targeted therapies, it is important to note that dose-dense therapy does not preclude, and in fact supports, the use of these agents. e-Grand Round CANCER WORLD I JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2012 I 19 Fatima Cardoso (FC) from the Champalimaud Cancer Centre, in Lisbon, Portugal, hosted a question and answer session with Clifford Hudis (CH) Q:[Ukraine]: In your opinion, should we use metronomic chemotherapy or dose-dense chemotherapy? Which of the two will be the preferred option for the future? CH: A metronome is, of course, the device that we use in piano lessons to keep time. The term is now being used, typically, to refer to low-dose weekly therapy, but essentially every regimen we ever use matches the metronome, with regular cycling of therapy. I reviewed a couple of studies with cyclophosphamide, doxoru - bicin and paclitaxel that directly answer the question on low-dose weekly therapy. Per - haps the best was a SWOG study with low-dose, weekly doxorubicin with oral daily cyclophosphamide compared to dose-dense AC, showing it was not better but somewhat more toxic. A study with low-dose weekly paclitaxel, which I sup - pose you could call metronomic, com - pared to q2 high-dose, or dose-dense, is open, so we do not have an answer. For other drugs, we would need to make comparisons to provide you with an evi - dence-based answer. That said, my heart lies with low-dose, less toxic therapy, espe - cially in the palliative setting. I do not dis - agree with those who advocate metronomic chemotherapy as palliation for incurable disease, although I am a little less con - vinced that we have meaningful data yet in the adjuvant setting. Clearly, we, and oth - ers, are continuing to study this. FC: I totally agree and I believe that we should probably test both, but my feeling is that what we call metronomic is probably better for the advanced setting, while dose- dense therapy makes more sense for the early setting. We need to let the trials end. Q:Do you have any data about the long-term risk of leukaemia by adding G-CSF to dose- dense regimens for breast cancer? CH: That was one of the interesting obser - vations that we made - when we give AC across all of our CALGB studies, long- term follow-up averaged out at about a 0.5-0.7% incidence of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). For our patient popu - lation, nearly half of those leukaemias are expected based on the natural history age - ing rather than treatment. We have never demonstrated that growth factor support for a dose-dense regimen was associated with any increase in risk. For example, the incidence of AML in our study was 0.7% with q2 and q3 and was, paradoxically, higher with the sequential regimen in one of the comparisons and the concurrent regimen in the other. The NSAPB saw a significant increase of AML early on with dose-escalated cyclophosphamide and G-CSF support. gave 2400 mg/m 2of cyclophos - phamide q3 with growth factor support, they saw an increased incidence, and I recall going to the National Cancer Insti - tute in the 1990s to talk about whether this was worrisome. The problem here is that high-dose cyclophosphamide is clearly leukaemogenic. The dilemma is whether it is the growth factor causing this or the high-dose cyclophosphamide. In that con - text, CALGB 97-41 shows no difference in leukaemia with or without G-CSF. But where the doses are controlled and steady, I think it is probably not the case that G-CSF is contributing anything in terms of AML and lymphoma risk. FC: If we look at non-dose-dense chemotherapy and the use of G-CSF in these situations, there is no conclusive evi - dence of an increased risk of leukaemia/ lymphoma in patients who need G-CSF, either as primary or secondary prophylaxis. Q:What could be the role of dose-dense chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting? CH: This question is not coming up quite as much these days, but used to come up quite a lot. Looking at the data, people are convinced of the benefit of giv - ing dose-dense therapy postoperatively, but when I am trying to shrink a cancer preoperatively, I would give q3. This is because we do not yet have the right data to prove that a dose-dense regimen is better preoperatively. select patients for adjuvant chemother - apy - technologies developed initially for use in breast cancer, but now intro - duced across a variety of cancers. Progress is also taking place in an area not so well known to the oncology community. The next big thing in bio - markers may be all about 'functional' imaging, which tells you not what a tumour looks like, but about what it is up to biologically. Two imaging technologies in particular are exciting interest for the potential they offer to help inform clin - ical decision making. The most surpris - ing, perhaps, is MRI. Valued for decades for its ability to provide anatomic images of soft tissue lesions, this technique turns out also to have potential for imag - ing tumour microenvironments and cellThe new imaging techniques that can help doctors select the right treatment at the right time Picture this \u00a7Anna Wagstaff On the road towards personalised cancer therapies, the tasks of identifying new targets and devising ways to hit them seem to be coming along quite nicely. Right now, the big challenge is all about finding ways to work out which of the rapidly expanding selection of therapies will work best for the patient in front of you. Clinicians are crying out for validated cost-effective and patient-friendly methods for gath - ering biological information ('biomark - ers') that help them to select the most appropriate therapy option. Some of these biomarkers are already well known - the FISH test for HER2 amplification predicts response to therapies designed to block HER2 signalling, such as trastuzumab or lapatinib, while KRAS mutation is a marker predicting resistance to EGFR inhibitors such as cetuximab and panitumumab. And long before these, oncologists were using levels of oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor as markers for response to hormonal ther - apy, for instance in breast cancer. Progress can be seen in the way that pathology labs are introducing an increasing number of tests for biomark - ers into the diagnostic routine. Outside the hospital setting, a whole diagnostics industry is mushrooming to provide test- ing kits to hospital labs and to offer diag - nostic services for more high-tech tests.

This can provide vital infor - mation about the nature of a tumour and how it is responding, or likely to respond, to a given therapy. The other technique of interest comes from the field of nuclear medicine, in the form of PET (positron emission tomography) or SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography). These techniques make it possible to visualise how an injected substance moves around the body by 'labelling' it with a tiny amount of radioactive tracer. Oncologists will be familiar with the increasing use of FDG-PET for measuring response to treatment, par - ticularly cytostatic treatments of solid tumours, where response typically does not take the form of tumour shrinkage, with the result that traditional anatom - ical imaging using CT or MRI can be misleading. This PET procedure uses FDG, a glucose analogue labelled with a fluorine radio isotope ( 18 F-fluoro- deoxyglucose), to map levels of glu - cose uptake around the body. This is in the process of being validated as a RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours) marker of early response. Glucose uptake - a generic marker of tumour activity - is only one of a number of markers of interest for clin - ical decision makers. The PET tech - nique, in theory at least, can be adapted to map any biological process or molec - ular marker that can be delineated by a labelled compound that can safely be used in a patient. This includes specific targets such as oestrogen, HER2 or EGF receptors, as well as more generic biological markers of hypoxia, cell pro - liferation, and cell death. A new generation of PET-MRI scanners has addressed many of the technical and practical challenges of Are my patient's bone metastases being controlled by her current therapy? This question, which standard imaging techniques can throw little light on, can be answered using diffusion-weighted MRI scans which map cell density and cell death. The answer in the case of this 65-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer, would seem to be 'yes', as revealed by comparing the signal intensity of the whole body scans and the ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) values before (blue histogram) and after (orange histogram) three cycles of treatment with FEC (5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide) and bisphosphonates.

For de Vries, that study represents only one example of many potential uses for molecular imaging. The technique, she argues, is a perfect tool for under - standing how to use targeted therapy. As these therapies, by definition, are designed to hunt down a target, if you want to know the extent to which the tar - get is present in a given patient, all you have to do is circulate a trace amount of the product with a radiolabel attached. Potentially these techniques could also be very helpful to evaluate whether tar - geted drugs are achieving the desired effect on their target in any given patient. In a number of preclinical studies, de Vries and colleagues have demonstrated the impact of a variety of targeted drugs on the expression of the relevant genes as visualised on PET imaging. They are now conducting clinical trials to visu - alise the effects of drugs specifically on ER, HER2 and VEGF expression. Molecular imaging can probably even help with identifying the appro -cers, for instance - one on the right and one on the left. This patient develops metastases, and they are hard to biopsy. You know one primary is oestrogen receptor positive and the other is not. If you can do a PET scan using 18 F-oestra - diol [FES], which binds to the oestrogen receptor, you can confirm whether or not ER is present on the metastasis\" - poten - tially important information when it comes to choosing a therapy. de Vries is setting up a prospective study in three Dutch centres enrolling patients with non-rapidly progressive metastatic breast cancer. The study will assess the added value of FES-PET and 89 Zr trastuzumab-PET (using tiny quantities of radiolabelled trastuzumab) to predict non-response to targeted treatment with hormone or anti-HER2 therapy before therapy initiation, and of FDG-PET to predict non-response early during drug treatment. \"What you want to prove is that it does make sense to get insight into whole-body tumour expression of ER and HER2 to make 24 I CANCER WORLD IJANUARY/FEBRUARY 2012 Cutting Edge functional imaging. The question now needs to be answered for both PET and MRI: in what way can they contribute to the everyday practice of personalised cancer therapies? ANALIEN IN THE IMAGING WORLD Elisabeth de Vries is a professor of med - ical oncology at the University Medical Centre Groningen, in the Netherlands. So convinced is she of the potential value of imaging for clinical decision making that she has waded in as \"an alien in the imaging world\". Her recent research efforts have focused on inves - tigating the clinical use of PET/SPECT, and more recently fluorescence imaging. de Vries believes these imaging tech - niques offer a way to address some of the knottiest problems in personalising cancer therapies -not least, the growing recog - nition that the biology of a tumour can vary markedly from one area to the next and metastatic lesions do not necessarily resemble the primary tumour. \"We all want to move to personalised medicine. We want to know who needs what drug either before or early during treatment. But one of the things that I find remarkable is this heterogeneity in tumour lesions. Tumour biopsies provide only static infor - mation on the status of a marker in a small part of the tumour and disregard the remaining tumour and possible metas - tases. Imaging can give us a better whole- body picture and insight into all lesions.\" What's more, she adds, because it is non- invasive it can be used repeatedly. Access to this level of information can be particularly important in cases where standard diagnostic tests are giv - ing conflicting information, says de Vries. \"You have a patient with two breast can - WHOLE-BODY PET IMAGES USING RADIOLABELLED TRASTUZUMAB \"Radiolabelled PET is a perfect tool for understanding how to use targeted therapy\" These PET scans using zirconium-89-labelled trastuzumab map amplified HER2 expression throughout the body in three patients. A prospective clinical trial is being set up in the Netherlands to evaluate the added value of using scans like this to predict non-response to anti-HER2 therapy Source: EC Dijkers et by \u00a9 Macmillian Publishers Ltd priate dose, she says. \"For instance, we know from clinical trials, and also from our own work, that if you study the phar - macokinetics of trastuzumab in the blood, it varies considerably from patient to patient. This seems to be related to a large extent to the total tumour volume in a patient, which makes sense: if your antibodies specifically go to tumour lesions, there will be a larger sink for the drug - and therefore more drug required - if you have more tumour on board.\" One implication might be that we may be using more trastuzumab than is nec - essary in adjuvant settings. Right now de Vries is actively explor - ing the potential for using fluorescence as an additional cheaper, easier and safer alternative to radioisotopes. The con - cept is identical to PET scanning, except that the chosen compound is labelled with a fluorescent marker. de Vries says that the advantages are that you don't need radioactivity, and fluorescence is also better at detecting very small lesions. \"You need only a few cells to get the sig - nal. Often for PET scanning you need a lesion to be between 0.5 and 1.0 cm to detect it.\" The main problem at the alising therapies, but his interest is not so much on imaging molecular targets that may be specific to a cancer phenotype, as building up an all-round picture of how a tumour is sustaining itself and how it is responding to treatment. Learning how to do this effectively could be of enormous benefit to speed up drug development and cut costs as well as making it easier to take informed decisions on the manage - ment of individual patients. Angiogenesis, for instance, is known to be important in delivering the oxygen and nutrients that growing tumours need, and radiologists have developed a technique - dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI/CT - that can provide whole-body images of the rate of contrast medium uptake, which is a marker for vascularisation. 'Before' and 'after' imag - ing can tell you how effective anti-angio - genic therapies such as bevacizumab and sunitinib are in a given patient. However, further research is needed to see how accurate imaging is at predict- ing response and patient benefit. Exciting though this may be, Padhani is looking for something more compre - hensive to guide the use of multitargeted Cutting Edge CANCER WORLD IJANUARY/FEBRUARY 2012 I 25 moment is that it is impossible to get a whole-body reading, given the limited penetration of light. \"Happily several interesting novel devices are in develop - ment that are able to detect fluores - cence, for instance during surgery, by endoscopy, with a handheld probe or using diffuse optical tomography to identify fluorescence-labelled lesions in the breast. de Vries is now keen to join multi- centre imaging trials in collaboration with US and European centres. She may feel herself to be something of an alien in this field but the traffic is not all one way. Plenty of imaging specialists are now crossing the border in the other direction to join forces with the clinical cancer community to see how tech - niques they have spent years developing can function in the real world. ANALL -ROUND PICTURE One of these travellers is the current pres - ident of the International Cancer Imaging Society, Anwar Padhani, a radiologist at the Paul Strickland Scanner Centre in Lon - don. Padhani shares de Vries' belief that imaging could offer a vital tool for person - MULTIMODALITY IMAGING: AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE RECIST CRITERIA OF RESPONSE? Combining different imaging techniques into a multiparametric evaluation can provide information on multiple biological behaviours of a tumour, which can help guide treatment decisions. This set of images of a T3N1 rectal cancer with mesorectal nodes, taken before and after treatment with chemoradiotherapy, provides information on ( from left to right ) angiogenesis (no increased blood flow (BF) on perfusion CT scan), metabolism (a decrease in glucose uptake and retention on FDG PET) and cell death (an increase in ADC values on diffusion- weighted MRI). Taken together they provide a picture of a good response to treatment, which correlated with the downgrading of the tumour to T1N0 on post-treatment pathological analysis Source: Courtesy of Roberto Garcia Figueiras, University of Santiago de Compostella \u00a9 Roberto Garcia Figueiras says there are many challenges to over - come before they can be introduced into clinical practice. These include the issue of how many tests you can do multiple times (cost, logistics and toxicity can be factors here). Then there is the issue of how imaging information is comple - mentary to other biomarkers such as cir - tumour markers, urine biomarkers, immunohistochem - istry. \"Where does imaging fit in, how does it correlate with these other bio - markers? There are exploratory investi- gations into this area but they have not progressed far,\" says Padhani. He reviewed some of these issues in a paper therapies. \"Just because you alter the blood vessels in a particular tissue doesn't mean that patients will benefit. You also need to look at what is happening to other processes in the tumour environment. If you kill some cells but make the tumour hypoxic in the process, you can make things even worse, because we know that hypoxic tumours are more resistant.\" Getting infor - mation on hypoxia requires different types of imaging, such as PET scanning using 18 F-misonidazole or 64 Cu- diacetl-bis (N4-methylthio- semicarbazone). There are also scans that can help show the extent of cell death (such as diffusion-weighted MRI), or levels of proliferation (PET using 18 F-fluorothymidine or 11 C-choline) or glucose metabolism (FDG-PET). As many of these processes are linked, it is not always straightforward to interpret the signals. Tumour cells that are starved of oxygen, for instance, tend to respond by switching on more glucose receptors. The FDG-PET scan will tell you where glucose metabolism is upregulated, \"but is that because it is more hypoxic or because the tumour phenotype is intrin - sically producing more receptors?\" Either way, he adds, you know you have an aggressive tumour. This array of imaging tools offers potential for understanding what a patient needs and how they are respond - ing to selected treatments. But Padhanihe co-authored on Multi- parametric Imaging of Tumour Response to Ther - apy, published in Radiology in 2010 (vol 258, pp 348-364). There is also a question about proof of clinical ben - efit. \"A lot of this imaging hasn't yet been correlated with patient outcomes. For FDG-PET we have firm evi- dence that changes in PET scans actually affect how patients feel and how they survive. This has been shown and in a number of different cancer types, including as a marker of response. But for the vast majority of others it hasn't been done, and the roadmap of how to do it has not been defined.\" He and his fellow res- earchers are calling on oncol- ogists to get engaged in this work. \"We can't do it ourselves. We can develop the techniques, but we need active cooperation from the oncologists to be able to take the technique forward, to find its role, what its 'killer app' is going to be. The landscape will change and they will need to become much more familiar with imaging as we need to be familiar with what they do. We need to do this together.\" SPEEDING PROGRESS TO THE CLINIC Efforts to progress the use of imaging in personalised therapies have been con - centrated in countries where major research bodies are capable of taking 26 I CANCER WORLD IJANUARY/FEBRUARY 2012 Cutting Edge \"There are many challenges to overcome before they can be introduced into clinical practice\" HOW IMAGING CAN HELP GUIDE TREATMENT CHOICE Using multiple imaging technologies before and during treatment can help characterise the tumour tissue and assess how it is (2010) Radiology 258:348-364. Reprinted courtesy of Anwar Padhani and the Radiology Society of North America tocol. She says that a lot of observational trials with imaging are needed simply to relate the signals they find to what they see in preclinical studies without inter - fering in the treatment. Such imaging add-ons can be very expensive, however - around \u20ac500 for an MRI scan, \u20ac800 for FDG-PET, and closer to \u20ac1000-1500 for other PET tracers, which are not so widely available. There is also a question of capacity. The EORTC imaging group is coordinating with the UK imaging network set up by Cancer Research UK, and between them they cover around 100 centres, but not all of them can do what is required. \"Not all clinical centres have the capacity to do these high fancy imag - ing techniques and you sometimes see a discordance between what we need for imaging and what we need for the clin - ical department. Sometimes they lack the special sequences we need for dif- fusion MR or they don't have access to FLT [ 18 F-fluorothymidine, an alterna - tive PET tracer].\" Stroobants believes that some of the more generic markers that Padhani talks about are good candidates for replacing the traditional RECIST criteria for meas - uring response in many situations, using FLT- and FDG-PET scanning and prob - ably dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and diffusion-weighted MRI. She believes that the diffusion-weighted MRI technique may develop to the point where it may start to be used in prefer - ence to FDG-PET scans, which are more expensive, involve radioactivity, and are logistically more demanding. But there is a lot of work to do before this technique can be used in multicen - tre trials because there is no standardis -on this task, such as Germany and the UK. Harpal Kumar, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, for instance, recognised in 2008 that \"imaging is fast becoming one of the most effective means of detecting cancer early and of determining which treatment works for which patient.\" The charity almost quadrupled its funding for this area of work to \u00a350 million ( \u20ac58 million euros) over five years. A lot of work is also being done in the US, which applies a lighter regulatory hand to the use of new radioactive tracers for investigational procedures. EU funding for developing imaging biomarkers was boosted in 2006 with the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), a \u20ac2 billion EU -industry partnership. Some of this is targeted to: Icreate disease-specific European Imaging Networks, Idevelop regional centres of excel- lence, creating disease-specific Euro - pean centres for the validation of new biomarkers and Ienhance collaboration with patients and regulatory authorities. The EORTC has already secured fund - ing for a trial investigating the value of diffusion-weighted MRI and PET imaging for proliferation and apoptosis for use as surrogate markers in early clinical trials. Leading this work is Sigrid Stroobants, head of the Department of Nuclear Imaging at the University of Antwerp, and chair of the EORTC's Imaging Group, which was established in early 2010. Stroobant's imaging group scans all new trial proposals submitted to the EORTC to identify opportunities for tacking on an imaging study to the pro -ation yet, and still a lot to learn. \"Very simple things that can influence the sig - nals are not known yet. Does the patient need to be fastened in a fixed position or not? What influence does the use of contrast enhancement have? Does it depend on the age of the patient?\" Cross-calibration is required before MRI can be used in multicentre trials, to make sure that differences between images from different centres represent real biological differences and not just different machine settings, and this is one of the work packages from the IMI project. \"We hope with the extra fund - ing we received from the EU we will be able to solve that problem, let's say within one year's time,\" says Stroobants. I'm hoping that within five years we can val- idate these as biomarkers of response.\" Key to carrying out such multicentre studies will be the imaging platform that EORTC has developed in coordination with Cancer Research UK, which will be used to collect the images centrally and conduct centralised analysis. An imaging 'warehouse' has also been established which will link to information on clinical data, tissue, blood and plasma samples stored in biobanks. The challenge is to find the funding to conduct these trials and to convince cli- nicians that it is worthwhile taking them on. Stroobants says this can be very hard to do, but that larger multicentre trials are needed. \"It is important that we try to incorporate imaging in trials and that we move away from doing single-centre stud - ies and trying to analyse data in our own way. This will not move the field forward. We need to think bigger, multicentre, standardised - the time to play in individ - ual centres is over.\" Cutting Edge CANCER WORLD IJANUARY/FEBRUARY 2012 I 27 \"We need to think bigger, multicentre, standardised - the time to play in individual donotreceivethesupporttheyneed Still waiting for the world to catch up The story of Belgium's first ever gynaecological oncologist oncology, his country wasn't ready, and he's been waiting for the world to catch up with him ever since. Why has the phar- maceutical industry been so slow to focus on gynaecological cancers? Why must it take so long to get answers to vital treatment questions? And how much longer will his patients have to wait for the sort of quality-controlled specialist clinics Belgium now provides for breast cancer care? Professor Ignace Vergote is a busy man. Arranging even an hour of his time is a difficult business, and when I meet him in his office at the University Hospitals Leuven, in Belgium, I can't help commenting on his seemingly impenetrable schedule. He looks at me coolly. \"But I suspect one of the reasons you want to talk to me is because I'm busy,\" he says. He has a point. Vergote, professor at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven and chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology and the Cancer Institute at University Hospitals, Leu - ven, is interesting because he has packed so much into his 56 years - as a gynaecological oncologist, researcher, teacher and champion of European col- laboration in research and practice. The 'short- ened' curriculum vitae he sends me is 79 pages long. Vergote sees himself more as a European than a Belgian, and he has been a pioneer in developing gynaecological oncology as a speciality in Europe. An investigator on some of the most important clinical studies on gynaecological cancer in the past 20 years, he was a president of the International Gyne- cologic Cancer Society and of the European Soci- ety of Gynaecological Oncology and chairman of the EORTC Gynaecological Cancer Group. Currently, he is gynaecology section editor of the European Journal of Cancer , chairman of the Euro - pean Network of Gynaecological Oncological Trial groups (ENGOT) and president of the Flemish Society of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. \"You might call me a workaholic,\" he says. But he suggests this isn't a word he would choose. Instead, the story he tells reveals a single-minded resolution to develop the speciality of gynaeco - logical oncology from scratch in Europe, and then steer it as serenely as possible through the choppy waters of professional territorialism and interna- tional differences. Collaboration on an interna- tional basis is the only way forward clinically and politically, he believes. 40 I CANCER WORLD I JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2012 Master piece A FIRST FOR BELGIUM Vergote was the first trained gynaecological oncolo - gist in Belgium. He decided on pursuing the spe- ciality very early in his career. After studying medicine at the University of Ghent, he specialised in obstet- rics and gynaecology at the University of Antwerp. His teacher at the time, Frans Uyttenbroeck, was very interested in gynaecological oncology and sup - ported Vergote's desire to train more in the field. The sub-speciality had been recognised in the USA since the 1960s, but on this side of the Atlantic it was well established only in Scandinavia. So in 1984 Vergote went to the Department of Gynaecological Oncology at Norway's Radiumhos- pital in Oslo - the national centre for women's cancers. He came back to the University of Antwerp in 1987 to put what he had learnt into practice. But there was a problem. As a national pioneer in a new speciality, his role in relation to general gynaecologists was not clear, which led to confusion. And he was still required to carry out general obstetrics work much of the time, which was not ideal: \"You have to make a commitment to your speciality to get better at it,\" he says. So in 1989 he took the radical step of returning to the Radiumhospital in Oslo as a staff member in gynaecological oncology, so that he could \"get better\". He did. He stayed for another four years, first as head of the Division of Ovarian Cancer and Tro - phoblastic Diseases, then as deputy chairman of the Department of Gynaecological Oncology, receiv- ing his PhD at the University of Oslo in 1991. Scandinavia remains special to Vergote - on his office wall hangs a massive repro - duction of \"Mot Skogen\" (Towards the Forest), by the Norwegian painter Edvard Munch, which was painted for Vergote with uncanny accuracy by his goddaughter. He is an honourary mem - ber of the Finnish Society of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, and nine years ago he was awarded the Norwegian Kolstad prize for Excellence in Gynaeco - logical Oncology. Belgium was ready for him on his second return, in 1993. As head of the Division Master piece CANCER WORLD I JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2012 I 41 of Gynaecological Oncology at University Hospitals, Leuven, he was part of the structures of a large refer- ral centre and his role was clear. Gynaecological oncology was now much more firmly established in his home country. \"I think it took this time for patients, gynaecologists and oncologists to realise that there was a need for gynaecological oncolo - gists, especially for can - cers in the pelvic area, which can be particu - larly difficult to treat,\" he says. \"I was not alone any more - there were others who had the same training as me. Together, I think we suc- ceeded in getting acceptance, and the same happened in neigh - bouring countries like the Nether- lands, France, the UK.\" A survey carried out by Vergote in the mid-1990s showed that gynaecological oncology was recog- nised by board certification in only around 35% of countries worldwide. Vergote has been instrumen - tal in encouraging change. As a council member and then president of the European Society of Gynae- cological Oncology, he helped set up a system for recognising gynaecological oncology training centres. \"It doesn't have legal status, but recognition from a European society means that trainees at these centres get an official certificate. I think this has played an important role in Europe.\" But the battle to gain official board-certification of the sub-speciality - even in his own country - con - tinues. \"In Belgium we have waited one and a half years for the government to enact the law that defines all oncological sub-disciplines,\" he says, \"and this applies to digestive respira- tory much as gynaecological oncology. It still hasn't happened.\"Unfortunately, the question of how a gynaecological oncologist's role is defined in relation to other pro - fessions is also unresolved in many countries. A QUESTION OF HOW NOT WHO \"Who does the chemo- therapy is a big question in gynaecological can - cers, and it is different from country to coun - try,\" he says. \"It's a big issue in this country, but also many others - in Ger- many for example, it's the gynaecologist who does the chemotherapy or the medical treat- ment.\" His surveys revealed that in the 1990s, medical treatment of gynaecological cancers was given by gynaecological oncologists in around 50% of countries. Breast cancer was treated by gynaecological oncologists in 45%. \"I'd say that both specialities, medical oncology and gynaecological oncology, have their advantages - because medical oncologists have the general internal medicine and oncology training, while we know the disease better and have training that cov- ers surgical and medical treatment.\" Vergote is determinedly conciliatory on this issue. He believes in the softly-softly approach to professional problem-solving and chooses every word he says to me with care, almost visibly calcu - lating whether its effect will be positive or negative. \"It's a... challenge,\" he says. \"But I usually say it doesn't actually matter who does it. As long as it's a caregiver who is really committed to concentrating on that disease full time, and is able to work in a multidisciplinary way. In treatment planning ses- 42 I CANCER WORLD I JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2012 Master piece \"It doesn't matter who does it, so long as they focus fully on that disease and work in a multidisciplinary way\"On the ward round. Vergote with fellows at University Hospitals, Leuven sions here there is always a medical oncologist present, even though gynaecological oncologists give the medical treatment in my department. We discuss the cases together.\" But although Vergote is generally a model of tact and moderation, there are three areas where he cannot help revealing frustration. One is the lack of profile that gynaecological cancers have compared to breast, lung and gastrointestinal can - cers. He bemoans the lack of cancer leagues and patient support organisations in these areas, in Belgium and other small countries. And while Belgium has breast clinics with set minimum numbers of patients per surgeon and easily accessed nursing and psychological support serv- ices, equivalent centres and standards are not available for rare types of cancer like trophoblas- tic disease, which can be much more difficult to treat. \"It's not fair to the patients,\" he says. Another area of frustration surrounds the money available for trials of new treatments for gynaeco - logical cancers. When new molecular target thera- pies were introduced around seven years ago, it was only their applications to the 'big three' markets - breast, lung and gastrointestinal cancers - that had been researched. \"That's why there is still no reimbursed molecu - lar target therapy in gynaecological cancer. It's not because we don't want it, or we're not clever enough. You simply didn't get pharmaceutical companies convinced that they should invest in gynaecological cancer, so the money for trials wasn't there.\" At last, he says, now that the market is full of first, second, third and fourth lines of treatment for the big three, companies have started to look at ovarian can - cer and are becoming interested in endometrial cancer. But cervical cancer is still almost entirely overlooked. His own department is now involved in 15 studies on targeted drugs for ovarian and endome- trial cancer. Altogether, it produces around 140 papers on obstetrics and gynaecology and 45 on gynaecological oncology every year - and the evi-dence of its productivity is in the stark corridors outside Vergote's office, where around 100 papers from peer review journals published in 2011 are posted on noticeboards. The third area of frustration Vergote identifies is the enduring problem of obtaining clinical aca- demic research funding. It is virtually impossible to get support outside the pharmaceutical industry, he says - and this inevitably has a major impact on what is, and what is not, researched. \"Apart from in the UK, there is almost no money available from governments for clinical academic research,\" he says. \"When it comes to pharmaceu - tical products, this is important because it's clear that when you're working with a pharmaceutical company, you are dependent on them, and there is a danger that you do what is in their interests. We all know that academic trials comparing one treat- ment with another are almost non-doable, even if it is in the interests of the patients or reimburse- ment. The same applies to surgery and radiotherapy, which as you know cures more cancer patients than medical treatment.\" PROMOTING ACADEMIC TRIALS The urgent need for non-industry trials on drugs and academic trials on surgery and radiotherapy resulted in Vergote founding the European Network of Gynaecological Oncological Trial Groups (ENGOT) five years ago. This is a network of 17 national and regional academic trial groups which aims to make academic trials more feasible through collabora- tion, and to work with the pharmaceutical industry so that academia has input into industry trials. But obtaining government funding for their work is not easy. \"Recently, as chairman of ENGOT, I wrote to the EU Commissioner for Health, asking if we could get support for some academic trials in endometrial and cervical cancer,\" Vergote laughs in exasperation. \"But we were not listened to. I got a letter back saying that a lot of money had already been put aside for translational research. But thatMaster piece CANCER WORLD I JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2012 I 43 \"Companies have started to look at ovarian cancer... but cervical cancer is still almost entirely overlooked\"misses the point, because that money is for labora- tory research and not for clinical academic research, certainly not for gynaecological cancers.\" The problem is well illustrated by Vergote's own experience. When asked about the research he is most proud of, Vergote points to an academic study published a year ago in the New England Journal of Medicine , which was independently funded and has already had a global impact. Spon - sored by the EORTC, it analysed outcomes in advanced ovarian cancer surgery according to whether the debulking surgery was timed before or during chemotherapy. \"I was very proud of this. But it took us ten years. We had to randomise 720 patients and, because it wasn't sponsored, people had to be very committed and give their time for free - talk - ing to patients, gaining informed consent, all these things without financial support. It's very difficult. So I am proud of that.\" THE NEXT BIG HOPE Given the constraints on research, and the time- consuming nature of independent randomised con - trolled trials, where does the hope for progress in gynaecological cancers lie over the next decade? I suggest that robot-assisted surgery, which Vergote practises, shows real promise for improving surgery outcomes. Yes, he agrees, the potential is there. But nothing is proven - again because of the lack of results from academic randomised controlled trials. \"Even laparoscopy is not proven,\" he says. \"In endometrial cancer, we are still waiting for the sur- vival results of a randomised trial from the US comparing laparoscopy with laparotomy. These types of things take decades.\" What about advances in screening? Prelimi- nary results from the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS) have indi- cated that CA125 tumour marker testing com - bined with transvaginal ultrasound is a feasible mass screening technique. But again Vergote preaches caution. He wrote an editorial in the Lancet Oncology pointing out that survival benefit from such screening was not yet proven. He believes that more accurate tumour markers than CA125 need to be found - and his department is working on this problem. \"In 20 years, I think that maybe we will have a marker that will be more specific and good enough for screening. But I think it's still too early to con - clude that we have found it.\" The real hope for advances that have meaning for patients in the next 10 years come from new drugs and new drug combinations, he believes. They won't necessarily cure more people, but they will lengthen survival. \"When I started in Oslo in 1984, we had only one drug, an alkylating agent, with a median survival of six months. But now, patients progress through an average of four or five lines of chemotherapy, and you also have drugs that obtain a nice response even in platinum-resistant disease. So median survival is now 46 to 48 months. There are now more possibilities of treatment when people relapse, and with the new targeted drugs we will have better drugs to get them in remission with fewer side-effects. \"The new PARP inhibitors for BRCA patients, anti-angio - genesis drugs, alpha-folate blockers and combinations of various targeted drugs - there's so much going on that I believe we will improve sur- vival, but mainly we will delay time to death. Of course, we all hope for the one molecule that will cure cancer or cure ovarian cancer, but it will be a combination of drugs and approaches.\"Master piece 44 I CANCER WORLD I JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2012 A leading role. Vergote with members of the ESGO Council during his time as president, 2003 -2005 INTHE GENES Vergote's cautious, data-driven optimism probably lies deep in his genes. His father was a finance direc- tor working for the Belgian government, and Vergote remembers that both his parents held medicine in very high esteem. No surprise, then, that all four of their children went into medicine or pharmacy. What is more surprising is that all four of those chil- dren found spouses who work in medicine, phar- macy and dentistry - Vergote's wife is a dermatologist. Two of Vergote's four children are also entering medicine - one is currently studying, and the other is practising internal medicine - with the other two opting for civil engineering and graphic design. All but the youngest have now left home. His family has always, he says, been extremely tolerant of his workload. Vergote can think of no hobbies to tell me about, apart from his work. He works every weekend, starting at eight in the morn - ing and finishing at ten or eleven o'clock at night. Yet he says he is a happy family man too. How can this be if he hardly sees his wife and children? \"It's not the time that counts, it's the quality,\" he says - every winter he ensures he gets away for a one-week holiday with his wife and children and their partners, where nothing else intrudes. So what, I ask, has driven him to work so hard, for so long, focusing not only at a local and national level, but also constantly looking beyond that to the European level? \"I am a European,\" he says simply. \"I am also a Belgian, but I feel our future lies in European co- operation. That's one of the reasons I have supported the EORTC so much, and why I started ENGOT. I believe we work better together. And this isn't just true in oncology but in politics. When I hear about the euro crisis... I find it hard to believe that the UK is not part of the eurozone, for example.\" Travelling abroad is also essential for good research, he adds, particularly when you come from a small country. \"And it's so important to be able to learn from other countries. In America, they have better communication between theirstates than we do, but to my mind they are often somewhat narrow-minded. Here in Europe, we are so diverse, and there are so many fantastic things going on. The first breast conservation started in northern Italy and in France - the idea came from Europe before Fisher started his famous studies in the US. But there is still too much nationalism in Europe, and I am keen that this should end.\" Our time is up. Vergote's words dry up as he makes it clear there is no possibility of extra time. He has other meetings to attend and patients to see. And it has become clear, over the course of that pre- cious hour, that what drives him on is not so much an addiction to work as an awareness that the tasks that are most worth achieving - whether they be meaningful research or seamless collaboration in Europe - are those that take the most effort... and the longest time. \"Even laparoscopy is not proven... In endometrial cancer, we are still waiting for the results of a US trial\"Master piece CANCER WORLD I JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2012 I 45 It's the quality that counts.
