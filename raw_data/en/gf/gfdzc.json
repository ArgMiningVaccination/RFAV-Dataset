We are strictly following guidance from the CDC, the Florida Department of Health, and the Broward County Health Department. Temperature checks will be performed prior to entry at our facilities. Telehealth appointments are available, and we are seeing patients in clinic as need be. The Institute for Neuro-Immune Medicine at Nova Southeastern University strives to advance knowledge and care for people with complex neuro-inflammatory illnesses through the integration of research, clinical care, and education. Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), Gulf War illness (GWI), as well as other fatigue-related illnesses are poorly understood. Individuals can experience severe, long-lasting fatigue, which cannot be properly explained through extensive diagnostic procedures. Our research partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Miami VA Healthcare System, National Institutes of Health (NIH), and other universities and private institutions furthers the understanding of these illnesses which can be used to improve health care.

This program is available to candidates who have completed a 3-year program in Internal Medicine. Eligible candidates should have a strong interest in Environmental Medicine and Immunology. Upon successful completion of the program, candidates will be Board eligible in Environmental Medicine and, therefore, able to sit for board certification examinations in Environmental Medicine. The program will be based at our Fort Lauderdale and Kendall Campus offices and will allow 6 months of environmental medicine rotations at locations throughout the United States. The Fellowship will teach and provide experience for the physician within the context of the diagnosis and care of the environmentally ill patient.
