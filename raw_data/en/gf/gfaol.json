Johnson & Johnson's Janssen Vaccine Information: Johnson & Johnson's Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) - Name: JNJ-78436735 - Manufacturer: Janssen Pharmaceuticals Companies of Johnson & Johnson - Type of vaccine: Viral vector - Number of shots: 1 shot - How given: Shot in the muscle of the upper arm - Ingredients*: The Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine includes the following ingredients: recombinant, replication-incompetent adenovirus type 26 expressing Eggs, Preservatives or Latex. The Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) and fact sheet for the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine is available through the CDC at [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/eua/janssen.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/eua/janssen.pdf) . How the Johnson & Johnon Janssen COVID Vaccine works: Viral vector vaccines use a modified version of a different virus (the vector) to deliver important instructions to our cells. Who Should get the vaccine: - First, the vector (not the virus that causes COVID-19, but a different, harmless virus) will enter a cell in our body and then use the cell's machinery to produce a harmless piece of the virus that causes COVID-19. This piece is known as a spike protein and it is only found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19. - Next, the cell displays the spike protein on its surface, and our immune system recognizes it doesn't belong there. This triggers our immune system to begin producing antibodies and activating other immune cells to fight off what it thinks is an infection. - At the end of the process, our bodies have learned how to protect us against future infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. The benefit is that we get this protection from a vaccine, without ever having to risk the serious consequences of getting sick with COVID-19. Any temporary discomfort experienced after getting the vaccine is a natural part of the process and an indication that the vaccine is working. Who should NOT get the vaccine - The J&J/Janssen vaccine is recommended for people aged 18 years and older. - CDC and FDA have recommended that use of Johnson & Johnson's Janssen (J&J/Janssen) COVID-19 Vaccine resume in the United States; However, women younger than 50 years old especially should be aware of the rare risk of blood clots with low platelets after vaccination, and that other COVID-19 vaccines are available where this risk has not been seen. Locate a vaccination site near you at - If you have had a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) or an immediate allergic reaction\u2014even if it was not severe\u2014to any [ingredientexternal icon](https://www.fda.gov/media/146305/download) in the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine (such as polysorbate), you should not get the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. - An allergic reaction is considered severe when a person needs to be treated with epinephrine or EpiPen\u00a9 or if they must go to the hospital. Experts refer to severe allergic reactions as anaphylaxis. Learn about [common side effects of COVID-19 vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html) and when to call a doctor. - An immediate allergic reaction means a reaction within 4 hours of getting vaccinated, including symptoms such as hives, swelling, or wheezing (respiratory distress). - If you aren't able to get the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, you may still be able to get a different type of COVID-19 "}
