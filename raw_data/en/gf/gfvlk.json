Vol. 03-8Preface The Idaho Administrative Bulletin is published once each month by the Department of Administration, Office of the Administrative Rules Coordinator, pursuant to Section 67-5203, Idaho Code. The Bulletin is a monthly compilation of all administrative rulemaking documents in Idaho. The Bulletin publishes the official rulemaking notices and administrative rule text of state agency rulemakings and other official documents as necessary. State agencies are required to provide public notice of rulemaking activity and invite public input. The public receives notice of a rulemaking activity through the Ida ho Administrative Bulletin and the Legal Notice published monthly in local newspapers. The Legal Notice provides reasonable opportunity for public input, either oral or written, which may be presented to the agency within the time and manner specified in the Rulemaking Notice published in the Bulletin. After the comment period closes, the agency considers fully all information submitted in regard to the rule. Comment periods are not provided in temporary or final rulemaking activities. CITATION TO THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN The Bulletins are cited by year and volume number. For example, Bulletin 02-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2002 , 03-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2003 . Volume numbers, which proceed from 1 to 12 in a given year, correspond to the months of publication, i.e.; Volume No.02 -1 refers to January 2002; Volume No. 02 -2 refers to February 2002; and so forth. Example: The Bulletin published in January of 2003 is cited as Volume 03-1, the December 2002 Bulletin is cited as Volume 02-12, etc. RELATIONSHIP TO THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE The Idaho Administrative Code is published once a year and is a compilation or supplemental compilation of all final and enforceable administrative rules in effect in Idaho. In an effort to provide the reader with current, enforceable rules, temporary rules are also published in the Administrative Code. Temporary rules and final rules that have been adopted and approved by the legislature during the legislative session, and published in the monthly Idaho Administrative Bulletin, supplement the Administrative Code. Negotiated, proposed, and pending rules are not printed in the Administrative Code and are published only in the Bulletin. To determine if a particular rule remains in effect, or to determine if a change has occurred, the reader should refer to the Cumulative Index of Administrative Rulemaking , printed in each Bulletin. TYPES OF RULEMAKINGS PUBLISHED IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN The state of Idaho administrative rulemaking process, go verned by the Administrative Procedure Act, comprises five distinct activities; Negotiated, Proposed, Temporary, Pending, and Final rulemaking. Not all rulemakings include all five. At a minimum a rulemaking includes proposed, pending, and final rulemaking. Many rules are adopted as temporary rules when meeting required statutory criteria and agencies often engage in negotiated rulemaking at the beginning of the process to facilitate concensus building in controversial or complex rulemakings. In the majority of cases, the process begins with proposed rulemaking and ends with final rulemaking. The following is a brief explanation of each type of administrative rule. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING Negotiated rulemaking is a process in which all inte rested parties and the agency seek a consensus on the IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Page 6 August 6, 2003 - Vol. 03-8content of the rule. Agencies are encour aged, and in some cases required, to engage in this rulemaking activity whenever it is feasible to do so. Publication of a Notice of Intent to Promulgate a Rule in the Administrative Bulletin by the agency is optional. This process should result in the formulation of a proposed and/or temporary rule. PROPOSED RULEMAKING A proposed rulemaking is an action by an agency in which the agency is proposing to amend or repeal an existing rule or to adopt a new rule. Prior to the adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule, the agency must publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Bulletin. Th e notice of proposed rulemaking must include: a) the specific statutory authority for the rulemaking including a citation to a specific federal statute or regulation if that is the basis of authority or requirement for the rulemaking; b) a statement in nontechnical language of the substance of the proposed rule, including a specific description of any fee or charge imposed or increased; c) the text of the proposed rule prepared in legislative format; d) the location, date, and time of any public hearings the agency intends to hold on the proposed rule; e) the manner in which persons may make written comments on the proposed rule, including the name and address of a person in the agency to whom comments on the proposal may be sent; f) the manner in which persons may request an opportunity for an oral presentation; and g) the deadline for public (written) comments on the proposed rule. As stated, the text of the proposed rule must be published in the Bulletin. After meeting the statutory rulemaking criteria for a proposed rule, the agency may proceed to the pending rule stage. A proposed rule does not have an assigned effective date unless published in conjunction with a temporary rule docket. An agency may vacate a proposed rulemaking if it decides not to pro ceed further with the promulgation process. TEMPORARY RULEMAKING Temporary rules may be adopted only when the governor finds that it is necessary for: a) the protection of the public health, safety, or welfare; or b) compliance with deadlines in amendments to governing law or federal programs; or c) conferring a benefit. If a rulemaking meets any one or all of the above requir ements, a rule may become effective before it has been submitted to the legislature for review and the agency may proceed and adopt a temporary rule. However, a temporary rule that imposes a fee or charge may be adopte d only if the Governor finds that the fee or charge is necessary to avoid an immediate danger which ju stifices the impostion of the fee or charge. A temporary rule expires at the conclusion of the next succeeding regular session of the legislature unless the rule is approved, amended, or modified by concurrent resolution or when the rule has been replaced by a final rule. State law requires that the text of both a proposed rule and a temporary rule be published in the Administrative Bulletin. In cases where the text of the temporary rule is th e same as that of the proposed rule, the rulemaking can be done concurrently as a temporary/proposed rule. Combining the rulemaking allows for a single publication of the text.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Page 7 August 6, 2003 - Vol. 03-8An agency may, at any time, rescind a temporary rule that has been adopted and is in effect. If the temporary rule is being replaced by a new temporary rule or if it has been published concurrently with a proposed rulemaking that is being vacated, the agency, in most inst ances, should rescind the temporary rule. PENDING RULEMAKING A pending rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency under regular rulemaking procedures and remains subject to legislative review before it becomes a final, enforceable rule. When a pending rule is published in the Bulletin, the agency is required to include certain information in the Notice of Pending Rule. This includes: a) the reasons for adopting the rule; b) a statement of any change between the text of the proposed rule and the pending rule with an explanation of the reasons for any changes; c) the date the pending rule will become final and effective; and d) an identification of any portion of the rule imposing or increasing a fee or charge. Agencies are required to republish the text of the rule when substantive changes have been made to the proposed rule. An agency may adopt a pending rule that varies in content from that which was originally proposed if the subject matter of the rule remains the same, the pending rule is a logical outgrowth of the proposed rule, and the original notice was written so as to assure that members of the public were reasonably notified of the subject. It is not always necessary to republish all the text of the pending rule. With the permission of the Rules Coordinator, only the Section(s) that have changed from the proposed text are re published. If no changes have been made to the previously published text, it is not required to republish the text again and only the Notice of Pending Rule is published. FINAL RULEMAKING A final rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency under the regular rulemaking procedures and is in effect and enforceable. No pending rule adopted by an agency will become final and effective until it has been submitted to the legislature for review. Where the legislature finds that the agency has violated the legisl ative intent of the statute under which the rule was made, a concurrent resolution may be adopted to reject the rulemaking or any part thereof. A Notice of Final Rule must be published in the Idaho Administrative Bulletin for any rule that is rejected, amended, or modified by the legislature showing the changes made. A rule that has been reviewed by the legislature and has not been rejected, amended, or modified will become final with no further legislative action. No rule shall become final and effective before the conclusion of the regular or special legislative session at which the rule was submitted for review. However, a rule which is final and effective may be applied retroactively, as provided in the rule.

HOW TO USE THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Rulemaking documents produced by state agencies and published in the Idaho Administrative Bulletin are organized by a numbering system. Each state agency has a two-digit identification code number known as the \"IDAPA\" number. (The \"IDAP A\" Codes are listed in the alphabetical/numerical index at the end of this Preface.) Within each agency there are divisions or departments to which a two-digit \"TITLE\" number is assigned. There are \"CHAPTER\" numbers assigned within the Title and the rule text is divided among major sections with a number of subsections. An example IDAP A number is as follows: IDAPA 38.05.01.060.02.c.ii. \"IDAPA\" refers to Administrative Rules in general that are subject to the Administrative Procedures Act and are required by this act to be published in the Idaho Administrative Code and the Idaho Administrative Bulletin. \"IDAPA 38.\" refers to the Idaho Department of Administration. \"05.\" refers to Title 05 which is the Department of Administration' s Division of Purchasing. \"01.\" refers to Chapter 01 of Title 05, \"Rules of the Division of Purchasing\". \"060.\" refers to Major Section 060, \"Content of the Invitation to Bid\". \"02.\" refers to Subsection 060. 02. \"c.\" refers 060.02. c. \"ii.\" refers to Subparagraph 060.02.c. ii.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Page 9 August 6, 2003 - Vol. 03-8DOCKET NUMBERING SYSTEM Internally, the Bulletin is organized sequentially using a rule docketing system. All rulemaking actions (documents) are assigned a \"DOCKET NUMBER\". The \"Docket Number\" is a series of numbers separated by a hyphen \"-\", (38-0501-0101). The docket numbers are published sequentially by IDAP A designation (e.g. the two-digit agency code). The following example is a breakdown of a typical rule docket: \"DOCKET NO. 38-0501-0301\" \"38-\" denotes the agency's this case the Department of Administration. \"0501-\" refers to the TITLE AND CHAPTER numbers of the agency rule being promulgated; in this case the Division of Purchasing (TITLE 05), \"Rules of the Division of Purchasing\" (Chapter 01). \"0301\" denotes the year and sequential order of the docket subm itted and published during the year; in this case the first rulemaking action of the chapter published in calendar year 2003. Within each Docket, only the affected sections of chapters are printed. (See Sections Affected Index in each Bulletin for a listing of these.) The individual sections affected are printed in the Bulletin sequentially (e.g. Section \"200\" appears before Section \"345\" and so on). Whenever the sequence of the numbering is broken the following statement will appear: \"(BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS)\" INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL CITATIONS TO ADMINISTRATIVE RULES IN THE CODE AND BULLETIN When making a citation to another Section or Subsection that is part of the same rule, a typical internal citation may appear as follows : \"...as found in Section 201 of this rule.\" OR \"...in accordance with Subsection 201.06.c. of this rule.\" It may also be cited to include the IDAP A, Title, and Chapter number also, as the TITLE number of the agency rule. \"01\" denotes the Chapter number of the agency rule. \"201\" references the main Section number of the rule that is being cited. Citations made within a rule to a different rule chapter (external citation) should also include the name of the Department and the name of the rule chapter being referenced, as well as the IDAP A, Title, and Chapter numbers. The following is a typical example of an external citation to another rule chapter: \"...as outlined in the Rules of the Department of Administration, IDAPA 38.04.04, 'Rules Governing Capitol Mall Parking.'\"IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Page 10 August 6, 2003 -

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: The rule is needed to implem ent the provisions of HB 298, passed into law by the 2003 Idaho Legislature, which authorizes the Department of Agriculture to promulgate rules for voluntary promotion programs. The Department has subsequently developed the Idaho Preferred program to promote Idaho food and agricultural products. These rules establish the requirements for use of the Idaho Preferred logo and define eligible products, application procedures and participation fees. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(1)(a)(b), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate for the following reasons: This rule is needed to implement the provisions of House Bill 298 passed by the 2003 Legislature and signed into law by the Governor on March 27th, 2003. FEE SUMMARY: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(2), the Governor has found that the fee or charge being imposed or increased is justified and necessary to avoid immediate danger and the fee is described herein: The rule is necessary to comply with federal grant fundi ng deadlines. Any delay in implementation poses a danger of losing the grant funding for launching the voluntary promotion program. Section 22-112, Idaho Code authorizes the the assessment of fees for the voluntary programs. Fees will be set annually by the Director and shall not exceed $1,000 per year. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Informal negotiated rulemaking was conducted by the Department. This included an agriculture industry rules advisory committee which met three times.

The interim rate will be adjusted to account for half of the difference in the over or under payment. The changes also give the Department the ability to adjust the interim rate of hospitals when the settlement amount is less than 10% of the payments received. In this case, the interim rate will be adjusted to account for half of the difference as well. The proposed rule text is in legislative format. Langua ge the agency proposes to add is underlined. Language the agency proposes to delete is struck out. It is these additions and deletions to which the public comment should be addressed.

Adjustments . Because of Extraordinary Circumstances. Where a provider's costs exceed the Title XIX limit due to extraordinary circum stances beyond the control of the pr ovider, the provider can request an adjustment to the cost limit to the extent the provider proves such higher costs re sult from the extraordinary circumstances including, but not limited to, increased costs attr ibutable to strikes, fires, earthquake, flood, or similar, unusual occurrences with substantial cost effects.

A Public Hospital that provides services free or at a nominal charge, which is less than, or equal to fifty percent (50%) of its total allowable costs, will be reimbursed at the same rate that would be used if the hospital's ch arges were equal to, or great er than, its costs. (7-1-97) 03. Adjustment To Cost Limits . A hospital shall be entitled to a reasonable increase in its Title XIX Cost limits if the hospital shows that its per diem costs of providing services have increased due to increases in case- mix, the adoption of new or changed services, the discontinua tion of services or decrease in average length of stay for Medicaid inpatients since the Principal Year. Any hospital making such showing shall be entitled to an increase commensurate with the increase in per diem costs. (7-1-97) a.

(7-1-97) (11-1-02)T 065. Adjustment To The Proration Of Ancillary Costs In The Principal Year . Where the provider asserts that the proration of ancillary costs does not adequately reflect the total Title XIX cost per diem calculated for the inpatient routine service cost centers in the principal year , the provider may submit a detailed analysis of ancillary services provided to each Title XIX recipient for each type of patient day during each recipient's stay during the principal year. The provider will be granted this adjustment only once upon appeal for the first cost reporting year that the limits are in effect. (4-5-00) (BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS) 455.

(7-1-97) 01. Annual Adjustments . Interim rates will be adjusted at least annually based on the best information available to the Department.

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Sections 67-5221(1) and 67-5226, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that this agency has adopted a temporary rule, and proposed regular rulemaking procedures have been initiated. The action is authorized pursuant to Section 41-211, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency, not later than August 20, 2003. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with di sabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: Sections 41-1007 and 41-1009, Idaho Code, allow, but do not require the Director to perform a fingerprint background check on applicants for a producer license. In order to provide the Director flexibility to meet requirements for reciprocity with other states for nonresident producer licensing, the temporary and proposed rule will amend IDAPA 18.01.15.016 to eliminate language that required fingerprint background checks on all producer license applicants. This will allow the Director to discontinue performing fingerprint background checks on nonresident producers who have met the licensing requirements of their home state, and remove a possible obstacle to reciprocity for Idaho resident producers who seek to beco me licensed as nonresident producers in other states. The temporary and proposed rule also eliminates the requirem ent that the fingerprints be taken by a law enforcement agency and obsolete references to agents, brokers and solicitors. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(1)(c), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate for th e following reasons: The rule confers a benefit by easing application requirements on nonresident producers and enhancing the likelihood of reciprocal treatment by other states for Idaho resident producers. FEE SUMMARY: The rule does not impose a fee. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to IDAPA 03.11.01.811, negotiated rulemaking was not conducted because of the need for temporary rulemaking.

New Section 285 has been added to the water quality standards to provide for a site-specific standard for water-column dissolved oxygen in the Snake River along the Idaho/Oregon border. In addition, the description of water body unit SW-1 in Subsection 140.13 is being changed to co rrect an oversight as to the actual boundaries. After consideration of public comments, DEQ intends to pr esent the final proposal to the Board of Environmental Quality in the fall of 2003 for adoption of a pending rule. The rule is expected to be final upon the conclusion of the 2003 session of the Idaho Legislature if approved by the Legislature. SECTION 39-107D, IDAHO CODE, STATEMENT: Section 39-107D, Idaho Code, provides that certain rulemaking requirements must be met if DEQ formulates and recommends to the Board a rule that is broader in scope or more stringent than federal law or regulations, or pr oposes to regulate an activity not regulated by the federal government. Section 39-107D, Idaho Code, does not apply to the proposed site-specific criteria for dissolved oxygen because the adoption of the criteri a are necessary to meet, but not exceed, federal law or regulations. The Clean Water Act requires states to adopt water quality standards that must be submitted to and approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). EPA's Clean Water Act regulations at 40 CFR 131.10(b) provide that a state, in designating uses and criteria for those uses, sh all ensure that its water quality standards provide for the attainment and maintenance of the water quality standards of downstream waters. The state of Idaho and Oregon share, as a boundary, the Snak e River. The state of Oregon water quality standards that apply to the Snake River differ from the applicable Idaho water quality standards for dissolved oxygen. As noted above, federal regulations require that Idaho's water quality standards ensure the attainment and maintenance of water quality standards of downstream waters, such as the Snake Ri ver in Oregon. In order to meet this federal requirement, DEQ has proposed to adopt, as site-specific criteria, st andards for dissolved oxygen that reflect Oregon's water quality standards. Because DEQ's proposed rule meets, bu t does not exceed, the requirements of federal law, the provisions of Section 39-107D, Idaho Code, do not apply. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Sections 67-5226(1)(b) and (c), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate in that the rule complies with deadlines in federal law and confers a benefit. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Negotiated rulemaking was not conducted because the temporary rulemaking schedule did not allow for the timing of it.

The action is authorized by Chapters 44 and 58, Title 39, Idaho Code. In addition, 40 CFR 271.21(e) and Section 39-4404, Idaho Code, require DEQ to adopt amendments to federal law as proposed under this docket. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: No hearings have been scheduled. Pursuant to Section 67-5222(2), Idaho Code, a public hearing will be held if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency. Written requests for a hearing must be received by the undersigned on or before August 20, 2003. If no such written request is received, a public hearing will not be held. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: Idaho's Rules and Standards for Hazardous Waste are updated annually to maintain consistency with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's federal regulations implementing the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) as directed by the Idaho Hazardous Waste Management Act (HWMA). Idaho has historically adopted both required and optional fe deral regulations so that Idaho's hazardous waste rules are the same as federal requirements. Optional federal regulations usually allow more flexibility to the regulated community; required federal regulations are necessary to maintain program primacy. Adoption by reference allows the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) to keep its rules up to date with federal regulation changes and minimizes the EPA Region 10 effort needed to keep Idaho's authorization current. Adoption by reference also simplifies compliance for the regulated community, who must only comply with one set of regulations. This proposed rule updates citations to the federal regulations incorporated by reference to include those revised as of July 1, 2003. Additional changes include technical corrections to corresponding federal regulations in Sections 005, 009, and 011 and clarification of the definition of Director in Subs ection 015.01. Access to federal regulations is no longer available at the physical address for the U.S. Government Bookstore as provided in Subsection 002.02; however, the web site address for obtaining federal regulations on line has been added. The proposed rule text is in legislative format. Langua ge the agency proposes to add is underlined. Language the agency proposes to delete is struck out. It is these additions and deletions to which public comment should be addressed. After consideration of public comments, DEQ intends to pr esent the final proposal to the Board of Environmental Quality in the fall of 2003 for adoption of a pending rule. The rule is expected to be final and effective upon the conclusion of the 2004 session of the Idaho Legislature if approved by the Legislature. SECTION 39-107D, IDAHO CODE, STATEMENT: This proposed rule does not regulate an activity not regulated by the federal government, nor is it broader in scope or more stringent than federal regulations. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Due to the nature of this rulemaking, negotiations were not held. GENERAL INFORMATION: For more information about DEQ's programs and activities, visit DEQ's web site at www.deq.state.id.us.

This action is authorized by Chapter 1, Title 39, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: A public hearing concerning this proposed rulemaking will be held as follows: August 27, 2003, 5:30 p.m. Department of Environmental Quality Conference Center 1410 N. Hilton, Boise, Idaho. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with disabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made no later than five (5) days prior to the hearing. For arrangements, contact the undersigned at (208) 373-0418. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The purpose of this rulemaking is to make the following changes to the Idaho Rules for Public Drinking Water Systems, IDAPA 58.01.08, Sections 003 (Definitions) and 553 through 562 (Drinking Water Operator Certification Rules). Conform to Section 39-119, Idaho Code, which requires that established fee standards be included in rule text wherever a fee is going to be im posed. The proposed changes will includ e the standards by which fees will be imposed for operator applications, certif ication exams, certification renewals, a nd course evaluations for continuing education units (CEUs). Make the Drinking Water Operator Certification Rule s consistent, where appli cable, with the recently adopted changes to the Water Quality Standards and Wastewater Treatment Requirements, IDAPA 58.01.02, Sections 403 through 413 (Wastewater Operator Certification Rules). These proposed changes include making rule language consistent with the Wastewater Operator Certification Rules for the following: definitions, certification requirements for systems, addition of optional voluntary certification, se parate eligibility criteria for certifying treatment operators and distribution operators, length of certification renewal cycle, number of CEUs required per certification renewal cycle, and certificate signatures. It is equally important that federal requirements already in place in the Id aho Rules for Public Drinking Water Systems related to drinking water operator certification not be changed. Federal baseline standards were required for inclusion in the state rule by Section 1419 (b) of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act. Failure to comply with the federal provisions will result in the loss of 20% of the state's annual Drinking Water Revolving Loan Fund capitalization grant from the federal government. Public drinking water system treatment and distribution operators, owners of public drinking water systems, water purveyors, Association of Idaho Cities, Idaho Water/Wastew ater Operator Certification Board, operator training providers, industry associations, and the general public may be interested in this rulemaking. The proposed rule text is in legislative format. Langua ge the agency proposes to add is underlined. Language the agency proposes to delete is struck out. It is these additions and deletions to which public comment should be addressed. After consideration of public comments, the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) intends to present the final proposal to the Board of Environmental Quality in the fall of 2003 for adoption of a pending rule. The rule is expected to be final and effective upon the conclusion of the 2004 session of the Idaho Legislature if approved by the Legislature. FEE SUMMARY: Pursuant to federal law, the state took over certification of drinking water operators in 2002. Previously, application and examination we re voluntary. The rule which transfer red certification auth ority to the state did not include fee provisions for application and testing. The program currently operates partially on fees collected for the testing and renewals and is subsidized by general fund and other program moneys. If the state is unable to collect fees for testing, the public health is placed at risk because the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0108-0301 - Fee Rule Idaho Rules for Public Drinking Water Systems Proposed Rulemaking IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Page 141 August 6, 2003 - Vol. 03-8will not be able to certify current and new operators and verify that they are qualified to perform their duties. Imposition of the fee is authorized by Section 39-119, Idaho Code. SECTION 39-107D, IDAHO CODE, STATEMENT: This rule regulates an activity not regulated by the federal government. The federal government does not regulate certification of drinking water system operators. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: The text of the proposed rule has been drafted based on discussions held and concerns raised during a negotiation conducted pursuant to Section 67-5220, Idaho Code and IDAPA 04.11.01.812 - 815. The Notice of Negotiated Rulemaking was published in the Idaho Administrative Bulletin, May 7, 2003, Volume 03-5, pages 26 and 27.

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Section 67-5226(1), Idaho Co de, notice is hereby given that the Board of Environmental Quality has adopted a temporary rule. The action is authorized by Chapter 1, Title 39, Idaho Code. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The purpose of this rulemaking is to conform to Idaho Code, Section 39-119, which requires that established fee standards be included in rule te xt wherever a fee is going to be imposed. These changes include the standards by which fees will be imposed for operator applications, certification exams, certification renewals, and course evaluations for continuing education units (CEUs). Under Docket No. 58-0108-0301, published in this Bulletin, the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) has initiated rulemaking to make comprehensive revisions to the drinking water operator certification rules. Proposed Rule Docket No. 58-0108-0301, which also includes fee standards, will become final and effective upon conclusion of the 2004 legislative session if adopted by the Board and th en approved by the Legislature. At that time, temporary rule Docket No. 58-0108-0303 will expire. FEE SUMMARY: Pursuant to federal law, the state took over certification of drinking water operators in 2002. Previously, application and examination we re voluntary. The rule which transfer red certification auth ority to the state did not include fee provisions for application and testing. The program currently operates partially on fees collected for the testing and renewals and is subsidized by general fund and other program moneys. If the state is unable to collect fees for testing, the public health is placed at risk because the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) will not be able to certify current and new operators and verify that they are qualified to perform their duties. Imposition of the fee is authorized by Section 39-119, Idaho Code. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Sections 67-5226(1)(a) and (b), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the ru le is appropriate in that the rule is necessary to protect public health and complies with deadlines in amendments to federal law. SECTION 39-107D, IDAHO CODE, STATEMENT: This rule regulates an activity not regulated by the federal government. The federal government does not collect f ees for certification of public water system operators. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Due to the emergency nature of this rulemaking, negotiations were not held.
