Scientific and Technicallnformation Brancfi 1979 National Aeronautics and Space Administration Washington, DCThis Index is available from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), Springfield, Virginia 22161 for $9 00 domestic, $ 18 00 foreignINTRODUCTION WHAT THIS CUMULATIVE INDEX IS This publication is a cumulative index to the abstracts contained in NASA SP-7011(177) through NASA SP-7011(188) of Aerospace Medicine and Biology A Continuing Bibliography. NASA SP-7011. by means of supplements, serves as a current abstracting and announcement journal for references on bioscience and biotechnology It has been compiled through the cooperative efforts of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA). and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Entries prepared by the two contributing organizations 'are identified as follows 1 NASA entries by their STAR accession numbers (N78-10000 series) 2 AIAA entries by their IAA accession numbers (A78-10000 series) HOW THIS CUMULATIVE INDEX IS ORGANIZED This Cumulative Index includes a subject index, a personal author index, and a corporate source index HOW TO USE THE SUBJECT INDEX Two types of cross-references appear in the subject index 1 Use (U) references indicate that the subject term is not \"postable,\" i e , not a valid term, and that the following term or terms are used instead For example DOSE U DOSAGE AIRLINERS U COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT U PASSENGER AIRCRAFT 2 Narrower Term (NT) references refer the user to more specific headings in the same subject area, under which additional material on the subject may be found For example FATIGUE (BIOLOGY) NT AUDITORY FATIGUE NT FLIGHT FATIGUE NT MUSCULAR FATIGUE In addition, a searcher may use the title or title and title extension in the index to narrow further his quest for particular items, this is because subject terms can readily include more than one class of document For example BIOLOGICAL EFFECT Vibratory force effect upon biological systems, particularly human organism Biological effect of cosmic and solar radiations on human body at high altitudes illustrates a case where two references on different topics are listed under the same subject termHOW TO USE THE PERSONAL AUTHOR INDEX All personal authors used in the abstract-section citations in the individual Supplements appear in the index Differences in translation schemes may require multiple searching of the index for variants of an author's name For example EMELIANOV, M D - and YEMELYANOV. M D HOW TO USE THE CORPORATE SOURCE INSCX The corporate source index entries are abridged versions of the corporate sources used in the abstract-section citations in the individual Supplements The corporate source supplementary (organizational component) does not appear in the index For example NEW MEXICO STATE UNIV, LAS CRUCES DEPT Of BIOLOGY (Source citation entry) NEW MEXICO STATE UNIV LAS CRUCES (Source index entry) IDENTIFICATION OF DESIRED SUPPLEMENT The abstract and descriptive cataloging for any accession number selected from the indexes may be found in the appropriate Supplement The page-number range of each Supplement appears on the inside front covar of this index Once the range of page numbers containing the elected accession number is located in the second column, the desired Supplement number will be found m the first column For example Page 191 will be found in Supplement 184 AVAILABILITY OF DOCUMENTS Information concerning the availability of documents announced in Aerospace Medicine and Biology supplements is found m the Introduction to the most currently issued monthly supplement IVTABLE OF CONTENTS Page Subject Index A-1 Personal Author Index B-1 Corporate Source Index C-1SUBJECT INDEXAEROSPACE MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY / a continuing bibliography 1978 Cumulative IndexJANUARY 1979 Typical Subject Index Listing [SUBJECT HEADIMO | '| TITlUXTtMSION | attornI\u2014\u2014Assessment of free-living nitrogen fixing microorganisms for commercial nitrogen fixation --- economic analysis of ammonia production [HASA-CB-157565] p0275 H78-30798 TITUREPORT NUMBED*AOE NUMBERACCESSION NUMBKR The title is used to provide a description of the subiect matter When the title is insufficiently descriptive of the document content a title extension is added separated from the title by three hyphens The NASA or AIAA accession number is included in each entry to assist the user in locating the abstract in the abstract section of this supplement If applicable a report number is also included as an aid m identifying the document ABBBBATIOH A subjective lethod fox the measurement of onochroiatic aberrations of the eye P0036 \u00bb78-16083 ABXOGB8BSXS Interstellar grains as possible cold seeds of life P0002 A78-11590 The formation of protobiological compounds daring the eruption of the tolbachik volcanoP0002 A78-11786 Deuterolysis of amino acid precursors - Evidence hydrogen cyanide polyiers ae protein ancestors p002\u00bb 178-14127 Phosphorus, a key to life on the primitive earth pOO-26 A78-1H680 Is there extraterrestrial life p0036 \u00bb78-16766 The evolution of the protein synthesis system.
