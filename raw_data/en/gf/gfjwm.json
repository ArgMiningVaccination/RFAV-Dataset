Using Essential Oils to Fight a Cold Essential oils can be a useful tool for naturally boosting your health. Although there are many varieties, eucalyptus oil is one of the most popular essential oils for colds. This oil is derived from the leaves of the eucalyptus tree and is used in many different traditional medicine practices due to its effectiveness. To use eucalyptus oil for colds, add a few drops to a diffuser or vaporiser and inhale the steam. You can add a few drops to a bowl of hot water if you don't own a diffuser. Another option is to mix a few drops with carrier oil, such as coconut oil, and apply it to your chest and throat. It's important to note that essential oils should never be ingested, as they can be toxic. Additionally, if you have asthma or other respiratory issues, you should speak to your doctor before using essential oils. In addition to eucalyptus oil, other essential oils may be helpful for colds: - Tea tree oil has antibacterial and antiviral properties that may help fight off colds and relieve congestion. - Lavender oil is known for its calming effects that can help you relax and get a good night's sleep, which is important for fighting colds. - Cinnamon oil helps ward off germs and boosts the immune system, and provides a rich and warm scent which can be soothing.
