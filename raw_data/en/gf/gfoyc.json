Integrative Medicine is a personalized treatment plan that incorporates both modern medicine and ancient healing techniques in order to promote physical, spiritual, and emotional well-being. For most of your life, you probably have visited a doctor and thought your doctor practices medicine the same as other doctors. While this is true for the most part, physicians have different philosophies that they follow. These philosophies determine how they approach health. As Naturopathic Doctors (NDs), we are trained to treat the individual by going beyond just treating symptoms. As Naturopathic Doctors we use signs and symptoms as clues to figure out what is causing the discomfort you may be experiencing. We are interested in the ROOT CAUSE of your disease. The body is a unique system that works in harmony. We move away from this harmony; we begin to experience DIS-EASE. By removing obstacles that interrupt good health, the body will begin to naturally return to good health. The benefit of integrative care is to be able to address all aspects of your health. We have a staff of practitioners with different specialties, and by working together, we can address not only the symptoms, but root cause of your health issue. We also love to see our patients before health issues, as we love focusing on preventative medicine. Your visit will comprise of detailed exploration of lifestyle habits, including but not limited to food, supplementation, exercise habits, social relationships, habits, sleep routine, and of course health status. We go through a detailed look at your life to know how to best serve you, not just look at your disease. Yes! You can schedule a Naturopathic visit and see us for just your Co-Pay. One of the major benefits of having a holistic approach within the conventional medical model is the ability to take insurance. We not only offer alternative therapies and get to the root cause of your health issue, but we can also serve as your Primary Care Provider (PCP). This will help centralize your care and get you referrals if needed. We see a wide variety of health conditions, and when appropriate we refer out for any necessary care that may be needed. However, because we have such a wide range of services we provide in office, we only refer out when absolutely necessary and indicated. All health conditions are approached utilizing the therapeutic order. The therapeutic order is a scientific approach that focuses on meeting a patient's needs while also minimizing side effects and harm that can result from more aggressive therapies. We start with what is most appropriate by looking at risks, benefits, and alternatives. No! Many people visit integrative clinics and receive lots of supplements to take. We do not believe in giving our patients tons of pills to take every day. The word supplement means \"in addition to\". The root cause always must be addressed. Nobody is sick from a lack of taking pills. Even if you have a health condition that requires medication, there are always lifestyle changes to be made to improve health. Do you understand the difference between a naturopath and a naturopathic physician? In case you are interested in Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) approaches to health or medical therapy, and you reside in the ideal location, you might have access to both. Knowing what these names and their inherent credentials mean can help you make wise decisions about whether these suppliers will assist you. The doctors of Naturopathic medicine earn N.D. or NMD levels from a naturopathic medical school. Both titles and abbreviations mean the same thing, but the person selects the name based on the educational institution, state practiced, or personal taste. They study all the standard medical coursework that an M.D. would study, and the \"natural\" sciences such as nutrition, botanical medicine (herbals), and mental health studies such as counseling or psychology. Additionally, schools require their pupils to complete four years of clinical nutrition training, acupuncture, homeopathic medicine, botanical medicine, physical medicine, and IV supplements to a standard medical curriculum. N.D.s have their licensing exams, which they may take upon graduating from a 4-year accredited institution. However, they may decide to train and take routine M.D. board certification examinations to become licensed as general practice (primary care) physicians, but this isn't common. Their clinics are often integrative, meaning that they provide conventional medical advice in addition to CAM. Naturopathic doctors aren't licensed in each state or state in the USA and Canada. The Virgin Islands, where a patient could locate a licensed N.D. In Canada, citizens may find an N.D. in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, and Saskatchewan.
