Use of EMPAVELI may predispose individuals to serious infections, especially those caused by encapsulated bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis types A, C, W, Y, and B, and Haemophilus influenzae type B [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. - Comply with the most current Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations for vaccinations against encapsulated bacteria in patients with altered immunocompetence associated with complement deficiencies. - Vaccinate patients against encapsulated bacteria as recommended at least 2 weeks prior to administering the first dose of EMPAVELI unless the risks of delaying therapy with EMPAVELI outweigh the risk of developing a serious infection. See WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS for additional guidance on the management of the risk of serious infections. - Vaccination reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of serious infections. Monitor patients for early signs of serious infections and evaluate immediately if infection is suspected. EMPAVELI is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). Under the EMPAVELI REMS, prescribers must enroll in the program [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Enrollment in the EMPAVELI REMS program and additional information are available by telephone: 1-888-343-7073 or at www.empavelirems.com. DESCRIPTION EMPAVELI contains pegcetacoplan, a complement inhibitor. Pegcetacoplan is a symmetrical molecule comprised of two identical pentadecapeptides covalently bound to the ends of a linear 40-kiloDalton (kDa) PEG molecule. The [peptide](https://www.rxlist.com/peptide/definition.htm) portions of pegcetacoplan [acetic (AEEA) in position 14. The molecular weight of pegcetacoplan is approximately 43.5 kDa. The molecular formula is C1970H3848N50O947S4. The structure of pegcetacoplan is shown below. EMPAVELI injection is a sterile, clear, colorless to slightly yellowish aqueous solution for subcutaneous use and is supplied in a 20-mL single-dose vial. Each 1 mL of solution contains 54 mg of pegcetacoplan, 41 mg of sorbitol, 0.384 mg of glacial acetic acid, 0.490 mg of sodium acetate trihydrate, and Water for Injection USP. EMPAVELI may also contain sodium hydroxide and/or additional glacial acetic acid for adjustment to a target pH of 5.0. INDICATIONS EMPAVELI is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended Vaccination And and Haemophilus influenzae type B at least 2 weeks prior to initiation of EMPAVELI therapy according to current ACIP guidelines [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Provide 2 weeks of antibacterial drug prophylaxis to patients if EMPAVELI must be initiated immediately and vaccines are administered less than 2 weeks before starting therapy with EMPAVELI. Healthcare professionals who prescribe EMPAVELI must enroll in the REMS for EMPAVELI [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Dosage The recommended dose of EMPAVELI is 1,080 mg by subcutaneous infusion twice weekly via a commercially available infusion pump with a reservoir of at least 20 mL. Dosage For Patients Switching To EMPAVELI From C5 Inhibitors To reduce the risk of hemolysis with abrupt treatment discontinuation: - For patients switching from eculizumab, initiate EMPAVELI while continuing eculizumab at its current dose. After 4 weeks, discontinue eculizumab before continuing on monotherapy with EMPAVELI. - For patients switching from ravulizumab, initiate EMPAVELI no more than 4 weeks after the last dose of ravulizumab. Dose Adjustment - For lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels greater than 2 \u00d7 the upper limit of normal (ULN), adjust the dosing regimen to 1,080 mg every three days. - In the event of a dose increase, monitor LDH twice weekly for at least 4 weeks. Missed Dose - Administer EMPAVELI as soon as possible after a missed dose. Resume the regular dosing schedule following administration of the missed dose. Administration EMPAVELI is for subcutaneous infusion using an infusion pump. EMPAVELI is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional. After proper training in subcutaneous infusion, a patient may self-administer, or the patient's caregiver may administer EMPAVELI, if a healthcare provider determines that it is appropriate. - Refer to the EMPAVELI Instructions for Use and the infusion pump manufacturer's instructions for full preparation and administration information. - Use aseptic technique when preparing and administering EMPAVELI. - Prior to use allow EMPAVELI to reach room temperature for approximately 30 minutes.

To reduce the risk of infection, all patients must be vaccinated against these bacteria according to the most current ACIP recommendations for patients with altered [immunocompetence](https://www.rxlist.com/immunocompetence/definition.htm) associated with complement deficiencies. Revaccinate patients in accordance with ACIP recommendations considering the duration of therapy with EMPAVELI. For patients without known history of [vaccination](https://www.rxlist.com/vaccination/definition.htm), administer required [vaccines](https://www.rxlist.com/vaccines/definition.htm) at least 2 weeks prior to receiving the first dose of EMPAVELI. If immediate therapy with EMPAVELI is indicated, administer required vaccine as soon as possible and provide patients with 2 weeks of [antibacterial](https://www.rxlist.com/antibacterial/definition.htm) drug [prophylaxis](https://www.rxlist.com/prophylaxis/definition.htm). Closely monitor patients for early signs and symptoms of serious infection and evaluate patients immediately if an infection is suspected. Promptly treat known infections. Serious infection may become rapidly life-threatening or fatal if not recognized and treated early. Consider discontinuation of EMPAVELI in patients who are undergoing treatment for serious infections. EMPAVELI REMS Because of the risk of serious infections, EMPAVELI is available only through a restricted program under a REMS. Under the EMPAVELI REMS, prescribers must enroll in the program. Prescribers must counsel patients about the risk of serious infection, provide the patients with the REMS educational materials, and ensure patients are vaccinated against encapsulated bacteria. Enrollment in the EMPAVELI REMS and additional information are available by telephone: 1-888-343-7073 or at www.empavelirems.com. Infusion-Related Reactions Systemic hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., facial swelling, rash, [urticaria](https://www.rxlist.com/urticaria/definition.htm)) have occurred in patients treated with EMPAVELI. One patient (less than 1% in clinical studies) experienced a serious allergic reaction which resolved after treatment with [antihistamines](https://www.rxlist.com/antihistamines/definition.htm). If a severe hypersensitivity reaction (including [anaphylaxis](https://www.rxlist.com/anaphylaxis/definition.htm)) occurs, discontinue EMPAVELI infusion immediately, institute appropriate treatment, per [standard of care](https://www.rxlist.com/standard_of_care/definition.htm), and monitor until signs and symptoms are resolved. Monitoring PNH Manifestations After Discontinuation Of EMPAVELI After discontinuing treatment with EMPAVELI, closely monitor for signs and symptoms of [hemolysis](https://www.rxlist.com/hemolysis/definition.htm), identified by elevated LDH levels along with sudden decrease in PNH [clone](https://www.rxlist.com/clone/definition.htm) size or [hemoglobin](https://www.rxlist.com/hemoglobin/definition.htm), or reappearance of symptoms such as fatigue, [hemoglobinuria](https://www.rxlist.com/hemoglobinuria/definition.htm), abdominal pain, [dyspnea](https://www.rxlist.com/dyspnea/definition.htm), major adverse [vascular](https://www.rxlist.com/vascular/definition.htm) events (including [thrombosis](https://www.rxlist.com/thrombosis/definition.htm)), or [erectile dysfunction](https://www.rxlist.com/erectile_dysfunction/definition.htm). Monitor any patient who discontinues EMPAVELI for at least 8 weeks to detect hemolysis and other reactions. If hemolysis, including elevated LDH, occurs after discontinuation of EMPAVELI, consider restarting treatment with EMPAVELI. Interference With Laboratory Tests There may be interference between [silica](https://www.rxlist.com/silica/definition.htm) reagents in [coagulation](https://www.rxlist.com/coagulation/definition.htm) panels and EMPAVELI that results in artificially prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT); therefore, avoid the use of silica reagents in coagulation panels. Patient Counseling Information Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide and Instructions for Use). Serious Infections Caused By Encapsulated Bacteria Advise patients of the risk of serious infection. Inform patients that they are required to receive vaccinations against encapsulated bacteria at least 2 weeks prior to receiving the first dose of EMPAVELI if they have not been previously vaccinated. They are required to be revaccinated according to current medical guidelines for encapsulated bacteria while on EMPAVELI therapy. Inform patients that vaccination may not prevent serious infection and strongly advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if these signs or symptoms occur. These signs and symptoms include the following: - fever with or without shivers or the chills - fever and a rash - shortness of breath - extreme pain or discomfort - headache with nausea or vomiting - high heart rate - headache and a fever - headache with a stiff neck or stiff back - confusion - muscle aches with flu-like symptoms - clammy skin - eyes sensitive to light Inform patients that they will be given a Patient Safety Card for EMPAVELI that they should carry with them at all times. This card describes symptoms which, if experienced, should prompt the patient to seek immediate medical evaluation. Anaphylaxis And Infusion-Related Reactions Advise patients of the risk of anaphylaxis and infusion-related reactions. Inform patients that anaphylaxis is life-threatening and strongly advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if these signs or symptoms occur. These signs and symptoms include the following: - difficulty breathing including shortness of breath and [wheezing](https://www.rxlist.com/wheezing/definition.htm) [swollen tongue](https://www.rxlist.com/swollen_tongue/definition.htm)or throat - feeling faint - rapid heart rate - skin reactions, including hives and itching - nausea or vomiting - confusion and anxiety - dizziness or [fainting](https://www.rxlist.com/fainting_syncope/definition.htm) Discontinuation Inform patients with PNH that they may develop hemolysis due to PNH when EMPAVELI is discontinued and that they will be monitored by their healthcare professional for at least 8 weeks following discontinuation of EMPAVELI. Inform patients who discontinue EMPAVELI to keep the Patient Safety Card with them for 2 months after the last dose of EMPAVELI, because the increased risk of serious infection persists for several weeks following discontinuation of EMPAVELI. Nonclinical Toxicology Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility Long-term animal carcinogenicity studies of pegcetacoplan have not been conducted. Pegcetacoplan was not mutagenic when tested in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) and was not genotoxic in an in vitro assay in human TK6 cells or in an in vivo micronucleus assay in mice. Effects of pegcetacoplan on fertility have not been studied in animals. There were no [microscopic](https://www.rxlist.com/microscopic/definition.htm) abnormalities in male or female reproductive organs in toxicity studies in rabbits and monkeys. Use In Specific Populations Pregnancy Risk Summary There are insufficient data on EMPAVELI use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, [miscarriage](https://www.rxlist.com/miscarriage/definition.htm), or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated PNH in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). The use of EMPAVELI may be considered following an assessment of the risks and benefits. Treatment of pregnant cynomolgus monkeys with pegcetacoplan at a subcutaneous dose of 28 mg/kg/day (2.9 times human exposure based on AUC) from the [gestation period](https://www.rxlist.com/gestation_period/definition.htm) through [parturition](https://www.rxlist.com/parturition/definition.htm) resulted in a statistically significant increase in abortions or stillbirths compared to controls (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of major [birth defect](https://www.rxlist.com/birth_defect/definition.htm), loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or fetal/neonatal risk PNH in pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal outcomes, including worsening cytopenias, thrombotic events, infections, bleeding, miscarriages and increased maternal mortality, and adverse fetal outcomes, including fetal death and premature delivery. Data Animal Data Animal reproduction studies with pegcetacoplan were conducted in cynomolgus monkeys. Pegcetacoplan treatment of pregnant cynomolgus monkeys at a subcutaneous dose of 28 mg/kg/day (2.9 times human exposure based on AUC) from the gestation period through parturition resulted in a statistically significant increase in abortions and stillbirths compared to controls. No increase in abortions or stillbirths occurred at a dose of 7 mg/kg/day (1.3 times human exposure based on AUC). No maternal toxicity or [teratogenic](https://www.rxlist.com/teratogenic/definition.htm) effects were observed in offspring delivered at term. No developmental effects were observed in infants up to 6 months [postpartum](https://www.rxlist.com/postpartum/definition.htm). Systemic exposure to pegcetacoplan of less than 1% of maternal levels was detected in fetuses from monkeys treated with 28 mg/kg/day from the period of organogenesis through the second trimester. Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether pegcetacoplan is secreted in human milk or whether there is potential for absorption and harm to the infant. There are no data on the effects of pegcetacoplan on milk production. Pegcetacoplan is present in milk of lactating monkeys (see Animal Data). Since many medicinal products are secreted into human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reaction in a breastfeeding child, breastfeeding should be discontinued during treatment and for 40 days after the last dose. Data Animal Data Pegcetacoplan was detectable in milk of lactating monkeys at less than 1% concentration of serum levels but was not detectable in the serum of nursing infants. Females And Males Of Reproductive Potential Contraception Females EMPAVELI may cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Pregnancy]. Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential prior to treatment with EMPAVELI. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with EMPAVELI and for 40 days after the last dose. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of EMPAVELI did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between geriatric and younger patients. OVERDOSE No Information Provided CONTRAINDICATIONS EMPAVELI is contraindicated in: - Patients with hypersensitivity to pegcetacoplan or to any of the excipients. - Patients who are not currently vaccinated against certain encapsulated bacteria, unless the risks of delaying EMPAVELI treatment outweigh the risks of developing a bacterial infection with an encapsulated organism [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. - Patients with unresolved serious infection caused by encapsulated bacteria including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria Action Pegcetacoplan binds to complement protein C3 and its activation fragment C3b, thereby regulating the cleavage of C3 and the generation of downstream effectors of complement activation. In PNH, extravascular ( [MAC](https://www.rxlist.com/mac/definition.htm)). Pegcetacoplan acts proximally in C3b-mediated EVH and terminal complement-mediated IVH. Pharmacodynamics In patients with PNH administered multiple doses of pegcetacoplan, the mean C3 concentration increased from 0.94 g/L at baseline to 3.80 g/L at Week 16 and sustained through Week 48 (Study APL2302). In study APL2-308, the mean C3 concentration increased from 0.95 g/L at baseline to 3.56 g/L at Week 26 [see Clinical Studies]. The percentage of PNH Type II + III RBCs increased from 66.2% at baseline, to 93.9% at Week 16 and sustained through Week 48 (Study APL2-302). In Study APL2-308, the mean percentage of PNH Type II + III RBCs increased from 42.4% at baseline to 90.0% at Week 26. The mean percentage of PNH Type II + III RBCs with C3 deposition decreased from 17.8% at baseline to 0.20% at Week 16 and sustained through Week 48 (Study APL2-302). In Study APL2-308, the mean percentage of PNH Type II + III RBCs with C3 deposition decreased from 2.85% at baseline to 0.09% at Week 26. Cardiac Electrophysiology At the recommended dose of EMPAVELI, no large mean increases in QTc interval (i.e., greater than 20 msec) were observed. Pharmacokinetics In patients with PNH, the serum pegcetacoplan concentrations achieved steady-state approximately 4 to 6 weeks following the first dose. The exposure of pegcetacoplan increased proportionally over a dose range from 45 to 1,440 mg (0.04 to 1.33 times the approved recommended dose). The mean (CV%) trough serum concentration observed at Week 16 was 706 (15.1%) mcg/mL and sustained through Week 48 (Study APL2-302). In Study APL2-308, mean (CV%) trough serum concentration was 744 (25.5%) mcg/mL at Week 26. Absorption The median Tmax of pegcetacoplan is between 108 and 144 hours (4.5 to 6.0 days) after a single dose. Distribution The mean (CV%) volume of distribution of pegcetacoplan is approximately 3.98 L (32%) in patients with PNH. Elimination The estimated mean (CV%) of clearance (CL) is 0.36 L/day (30%) and median effective half-life of elimination (t1/2) is 8.6 days in patients with PNH. Metabolism Pegcetacoplan is expected to be metabolized into small peptides and [amino acids](https://www.rxlist.com/amino_acids/definition.htm) by catabolic pathways. Specific Populations There were no clinically significant differences on the pharmacokinetics of pegcetacoplan based on age (19 to 81 years old), sex, race (Asian vs. non-Asian), renal impairment, and hepatic function as is insufficient information to characterize the anti-drug antibody response to EMPAVELI and the effects of anti-drug antibodies on pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, or effectiveness of pegcetacoplan products. Animal Toxicology And/Or Pharmacology In [toxicology](https://www.rxlist.com/toxicology/definition.htm) studies in rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys, [epithelial](https://www.rxlist.com/epithelial/definition.htm) vacuolation and infiltrates of vacuolated macrophages were observed in multiple tissues, including the [renal tubules](https://www.rxlist.com/renal_tubules/definition.htm), following daily subcutaneous doses of pegcetacoplan up to 7 times the human dose. These findings are attributable to uptake of the PEG moieties of pegcetacoplan. Renal degeneration was observed microscopically in rabbits at exposures (Cmax and AUC) less than those for the human dose, and in monkeys at exposures approximately 2.7-fold those for the human dose. The clinical significance of these findings is uncertain. Clinical Studies Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria The efficacy and safety of EMPAVELI in patients with PNH were assessed in two open label, randomized-controlled Phase 3 studies: Study APL2-302 (NCT03500549) and Study APL2-308 (NCT04085601). All patients who completed the studies were eligible to enroll in a separate long-term [extension](https://www.rxlist.com/extension/definition.htm) study. In both studies, patients were vaccinated against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis types A, C, W, Y, and B, and Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), either within 2 years prior to Day 1 or within 2 weeks after starting treatment with EMPAVELI. Patients vaccinated after initiation of treatment with EMPAVELI received [prophylactic](https://www.rxlist.com/prophylactic/definition.htm) treatment with appropriate antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination. In addition, prophylactic [antibiotic](https://www.rxlist.com/antibiotic/definition.htm) therapy was administered at the discretion of the investigator in accordance with [local treatment](https://www.rxlist.com/local_treatment/definition.htm) guidelines for patients with PNH receiving treatment with a complement inhibitor. A dose of 1,080 mg twice weekly was used for patients randomized to the EMPAVELI group of each study. If required, the dose of EMPAVELI could be adjusted to 1,080 mg every 3 days. EMPAVELI was administered as a subcutaneous infusion; the infusion time was approximately 20 to 40 minutes. Study In Complement-Inhibitor Experienced Adult Patients With PNH (Study APL2-302) The study enrolled patients with PNH who had been treated with a stable dose of eculizumab for at least the previous 3 months and with Hb levels less than 10.5 g/dL. Eligible patients entered a 4-week run-in period during which they received EMPAVELI 1,080 mg subcutaneously twice weekly in addition to their current dose of eculizumab. Patients were then randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 1,080 mg of EMPAVELI twice weekly or their current dose of eculizumab through the duration of the 16-week randomized controlled period (RCP). [Randomization](https://www.rxlist.com/randomization/definition.htm) was stratified based on the number of packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions within the 12 months prior to Day -28 (<4; 4) and [platelet count](https://www.rxlist.com/platelet_count/definition.htm) at screening (<100,000/mm3; 100,000/mm3). Following completion of the RCP, all patients entered a 32-week open-label period (OLP) and received monotherapy with randomized to eculizumab entered second 4-week run-in period during which they received EMPAVELI in addition to eculizumab before continuing on to receive EMPAVELI monotherapy. All patients who completed the 48-week period was eligible to enroll in a separate long-term extension study. A total of 80 patients were randomized to receive treatment, 41 to EMPAVELI and 39 to eculizumab. Demographics and baseline disease characteristics were generally well balanced between treatment groups (see Table 2). The median times from PNH diagnosis to Day -28 were 6.0 and 9.7 years, respectively, for EMPAVELI and eculizumab. The baseline mean total PNH [RBC](https://www.rxlist.com/rbc/definition.htm) clone sizes (Type III) were 47% for EMPAVELI and 50% for eculizumab. Twenty-nine percent and 23% of patients had a history of major adverse vascular events, and 37% and 26% had a history of thrombosis for patients receiving EMPAVELI or eculizumab, respectively. Within 28 days prior to the first dose of EMPAVELI or eculizumab, respectively, 34% and 31% of patients used anti-thrombotic agents (anti-platelet and/or anticoagulants). During Study APL2-302, 37% and 36% of patients on EMPAVELI and eculizumab, respectively, used antithrombotic agents. A total of 38 patients in the group treated with EMPAVELI and 39 patients in the eculizumab group completed the 16-week RCP and continued into the 32-week OLP. Because of adverse reactions of hemolysis, 3 patients were discontinued from the EMPAVELI group during the RCP. Two out of 41 patients in the EMPAVELI group needed the dose adjustment to 1,080 mg every 3 days. Table 3: Patient Baseline Demographics and Characteristics in Study APL2-302 EMPAVELI was based on change from baseline to Week 16 (during RCP) in hemoglobin level. Baseline was defined as the average of measurements recorded prior to taking the first dose of EMPAVELI. Supportive efficacy data included [transfusion](https://www.rxlist.com/transfusion/definition.htm) avoidance, defined as the proportion of patients who did not require a transfusion during the RCP, and change from baseline to Week 16 in absolute [reticulocyte count](https://www.rxlist.com/reticulocyte_count/definition.htm) (ARC). EMPAVELI was superior to eculizumab for the change from baseline in hemoglobin level at Week 16 (p<0.0001). The adjusted mean change from baseline in hemoglobin level was 2.37 g/dL in the group treated with EMPAVELI versus -1.47 g/dL in the eculizumab group (Figure 1), demonstrating an adjusted mean increase of 3.84 g/dL with EMPAVELI compared to eculizumab at Week 16 (95% CI, 2.33-5.34). Figure 1: Adjusted Mean (\u00b1 SE) Change from Baseline to Week 16 in Hemoglobin (g/dL)* in Study APL2-302 |*Treatment effect estimates from a mixed model are shown. The mixed model contained the categorical effects of treatment, visit, treatment by visit interaction, and stratification factors (transfusion history and platelet count at screening), and the continuous covariate of baseline value.| Non-inferiority was demonstrated in the endpoints of transfusion avoidance and change from baseline in ARC at Week 16. The adjusted means, treatment differences, and confidence intervals (CIs) for additional efficacy results are shown in Table 4.

All 77 patients who completed the RCP entered the 32- week OLP, during which all patients received EMPAVELI, resulting in a total exposure of up to 48 weeks. Between Week 16 and Week 48, 10 patients discontinued the study, all due to adverse reactions, and thirteen patients had a dose adjustment to 1,080 mg every three days. The efficacy results at Week 48 were generally consistent with those at Week 16. Study In Complement-Inhibitor Na\u00efve Adult Patients With PNH (Study APL2-308) Study APL2-308 enrolled patients with PNH who had not been treated with any complement inhibitor within 3 months prior to enrollment and with Hb levels less than the lower limit of normal (LLN). Eligible patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive EMPAVELI or supportive care [excluding complement inhibitors (e.g., transfusions, corticosteroids, supplements such as iron, folate, and vitamin B12), hereafter referred to as the control arm] through the duration of the 26-week treatment period. Randomization was stratified based on the number of packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions within the 12 months prior to Day -28 (<4; 4). At any point during the study, a patient assigned to the control arm treatment group who had Hb levels 2 g/dL below baseline or presented with a PNH associated thromboembolic event was offered cross-over to EMPAVELI for the remainder of the study. A total of 53 patients were randomized, 35 to EMPAVELI and 18 to the control arm. Demographics and baseline disease characteristics were generally well balanced between treatment groups (see Table 4). The mean times from PNH diagnosis to Day 1 were 5.7 and 5.5 years, respectively, for EMPAVELI and the control arm. The baseline mean total PNH RBC clone sizes (Type III) were 31% for EMPAVELI and 28% for the control arm. In the EMPAVELI group, 2.9% of patients had a history of major adverse vascular events. Two patients (5.7%) in the EMPAVELI group and 3 patients (16.7%) in the control arm group had a history of at least 1 type of thrombosis. Within 28 days prior to the first dose of EMPAVELI or the control arm, respectively, 17.1% and 27.8% of patients used anti-thrombotic agents (anti-platelet and/or anticoagulants). During Study APL2-308, 8.6% and 0% of patients on EMPAVELI and the control arm, respectively, used antithrombotic agents. Eleven of 18 patients randomized to the control transitioned to cross-over therapy with EMPAVELI due to a decreased Hb level 2 g/dL below baseline. Three patients treated with EMPAVELI required dose adjustment to 1,080 mg every 3 days. Three patients (5.7%; two patients in the EMPAVELI group and one patient in the control arm group) discontinued the study, none due to an adverse reaction. Table 5: Patient Baseline Demographics and Characteristics in Study APL2-308 (excluding complement inhibitors)| The efficacy of EMPAVELI was based on the percentage of patients achieving hemoglobin stabilization, defined as avoidance of a >1 g/dL decrease in hemoglobin levels from baseline in the absence of transfusion, and the change from baseline in LDH level. Supportive efficacy data included change from baseline in absolute [reticulocyte](https://www.rxlist.com/reticulocyte/definition.htm) count (ARC), change from baseline in hemoglobin, and transfusion avoidance, defined as the proportion of patients who did not require a transfusion through Week 26. Baseline was defined as the average of measurements recorded prior to taking the first dose of EMPAVELI or prior to randomization to the control arm treatment group. Efficacy results are shown in Table 6 below. Table 6: Efficacy Results During the 26-Week Study in = supportive care (excluding complement inhibitors) | b The post baseline missing values (including the values after cross-over from the control arm) are imputed using a multiple imputation method. Data collected after cross-over from the control arm is excluded in analyses. \u00a7Patients who crossed over from the control arm group to the EMPAVELI group, withdrew from the study, or were lost to follow up are considered as failing to achieve the criteria. *p-value is obtained by stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test.
