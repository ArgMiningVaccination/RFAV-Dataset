VVA is a condition where the skin of your vagina and vulva becomes thin, dry and irritated. VVA happens after menopause, when your body stops making estrogen. Estrogen is the hormone that keeps skin of the genitals healthy and producing its own moisture. VVA symptoms include: Vaginal dryness Pain during i ntercourse or other penetrative sex play Itching or burning of the skin of the vulva or vagina Swelling and/or redness of the skin of the vulva or vagina Brown or yellow discharge from the vagina VVA can me an that you are uncomfortable in your day -to-day life. It also can mean that sex is uncomfortable or painful, and sometimes impossible. This is especially true when sex involves putting something in the vagina. What Causes VVA ? After menopause, your body produces less estrogen than before. Menopause can occur naturally with age or be caused by surgery or some c ancer treatments. C ancer survivor s may also be treated with drugs that suppress estrogen's effect in the body. Some kinds of birth control pill s can also cause VVA. The loss of estrogen to the skin of the vulva an d vagina causes VVA to happen. This is because estrogen promotes healthy blood flow to the small blood vessels in your vulva and vagina . When estrogen goes down , the lack of blood flow causes VVA symptoms . What can I do about VVA ? There are a variety of choices for treating VVA . Keep yourself healthy, avoid irritants to the vulva and vagina, and use moisturizers and lubricants. 1. Healthy lifestyle choices daily exercise of 30 -60 minutes to promote healthy blood flow no smoking; smoking damages blood vessels and reduces blood flow to the small blood vessels in the vulva and vagina a diet that includes : 1) H ealthy oils such as olive oil, tree nuts and seeds. 2) Lean meats, fatty fish and at least 5 servings per day of vegetables and fruits. 3) Few sweets and processed foods.

Painful sex that is not caused by VulvoVaginal Atrophy Many postmenopausal women also have a gradual tightening of the muscles that are around the opening of the vagina. This tightening with vaginal dryness and fragile, irritated skin, makes penetrative sex more painful and difficult . It may still hurt even when using a lubricant, moisturizer, topical estrogen, or all three. This feels like there is a tight band about an inch inside the opening of the vagina . Some people describe it as feeling like their partner hits a wall when trying to start intercourse. It is important to stop trying to have intercourse when this happens until you get treatment. This is especially true if it hurts. Pain during sex can cause a very painful condition where the pelvic floor muscles spasm at the opening of the vagina.

A pelvic floor therapist will do an evaluation to determine the cause of your discomfort .
