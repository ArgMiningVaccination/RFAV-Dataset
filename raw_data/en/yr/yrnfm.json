What type of rapid antigen tests should I use? The Australian Government's regulatory agency, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), oversees the conditions of supply for [rapid antigen test kits](https://www.tga.gov.au/sites/default/files/consumer-fact-sheet-rapid-antigen-self-tests.pdf). For your own safety you should only use a self-test kit that has been approved by the TGA. The TGA website has a list of all [home use tests approved by the TGA](https://www.tga.gov.au/covid-19-rapid-antigen-self-tests-are-approved-australia), along with a copy of the manufacturer's instructions for each test. A consumer fact sheet is available on the [TGA website](https://www.tga.gov.au/sites/default/files/consumer-fact-sheet-rapid-antigen-self-tests.pdf). More detailed information on rapid antigen self-tests can be found on the [TGA website](https://www.tga.gov.au/covid-19-rapid-antigen-self-tests-home-use). Video: Doing a 15 minute rapid antigen test - in your language There are different self-test kits available. Follow the instructions provided within the test.

No. NSW Health recommends you do not eat, drink or brush your teeth for at least 30 minutes before doing a saliva rapid antigen test. This will ensure a clean sample is taken. If you still have food, drink or toothpaste residue in your mouth it might coat the swab stick and affect the test result. Rapid antigen tests for COVID-19 can be very accurate and specific when used as directed. However, experience overseas has shown food and drink, especially acidic drinks like soft drink and fruit juice, can impact the ability of the test to read the sample correctly. Where saliva rapid antigen tests are being used for routine testing, like before going to school, NSW Health recommends people do the test first thing in the morning, before eating or drinking, and supervised where required. Can rapid antigen test kits be used for children? Yes. Tests for children should always be done or supervised by an adult. Some kits cannot be used on young children and babies. Please carefully follow any instructions provided with the test kit if using the test on a child or baby. Read the [COVID-19 advice for parents](https://www.nsw.gov.au/covid-19/stay-safe/advice-for-parents-students), students and children. How do I store and dispose of a rapid antigen test? Store the test kit in a safe, dry, cool space. Refer to the test kit instructions. Disposal will vary according to information provided with the test instructions. Some tests come with a plastic bag to place the contents of the test into (including the swab). This bag is then placed into another bag for disposal with the household rubbish. Test kit materials are not recyclable. If no bags are provided you can place the used items from the test into a small plastic bag that can be sealed. This bag should be put into another bag that can be sealed and disposed of in the household rubbish. Wash your hands carefully after completing the test and disposing of the test kit contents.
