As a graduate of Yale University's Family Nurse Practitioner program in 1987 I was fully committed to the medical model of health and disease upon which my training was based. After more than a decade of prescribing pharmaceutical drugs, however, I developed a strong gut feeling that there must be something \"more\". Intuitively I sensed that there was a connection between physical problems and the state of mind that mainstream medicine had not grasped. I began an intensive search for this missing link, never suspecting that the answer lay in a forgotten, 200 year old medical tradition called \"homeopathy\". While I was taking workshops on hypnosis, guided imagery, and other mind-body therapies my two year old son became ill with an ear infection. After two courses of antibiotics failed to resolve his high fever and pain I became desperate, and brought him to a homeopath. Not having much faith in the little sugar pellets I was told to dissolve on his tongue, the rapid cure I then observed amazed me. Like most people, I tried to dismiss what I couldn't understand. But a repeat experience several months later forced me to take a closer look at this obscure medical art and science. Within a year I had enrolled in the Hahnemann College of Homeopathy, widely considered the best and most thorough program in North America. Taught by Roger Morrison, Jonathan Shore, and Nancy Herrick, and other dedicated homeopaths, this four year program gave me a deep grounding in homeopathic philosophy, materia medica (the study of the sphere of action of different homeopathic remedies), case analysis, and management. After one year of study I was so persuaded of the superior efficacy and deeper healing provided by homeopathy that I opened up my own homeopathic practice in downtown Portland, and resigned my positions in mainstream medical settings. I had educated myself out of my jobs! Since graduation as valedictorian of my class in 2001 I have continued my post-graduate studies with the best homeopaths in the world. Of these, the teachers who have influenced my practice the most are Rajan Sankaran, Divya Chabbra, Jan Scholten, and Dinesh Chauhan. I have also served as newsletter editor for the North American Society of Homeopaths, guest editor of the journal Interhomeopathy, and published many articles and cured cases in professional Homeopathic journals. I take great joy in my practice of homeopathic medicine treatment . It allows me to become both an instrument in, and a witness to, a healing process which points to a deep compassion and impulse towards wholeness built into the structure of our universe. What does 'CCH' stand for? CCH means 'Certified in Classical Homeopathy'. This certification is increasingly recognized as the standard which guarantees professional competency in a field which still has very varied educational requirements from school to school, and includes practitioners from a variety of licensed and unlicensed backgrounds.
