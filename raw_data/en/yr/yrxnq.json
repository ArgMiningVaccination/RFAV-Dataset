Getting the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of those vitamins and nutrients will help to keep you healthy. Vitamin A [Vitamin A](http://healthlibrary.osfhealthcare.org/Search/40,VitaminsQuiz) helps with the immune system as a whole and in the functioning of the heart, lungs, kidneys and other organs. \"Really what it does is cell growth,\" Kaela said.
