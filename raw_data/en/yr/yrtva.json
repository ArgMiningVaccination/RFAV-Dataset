Nichol, MD, MPH PURPOSE: Influenza and pneumococcal vaccines are under- used. Systems approaches that incorporate administrative andorganizational strategies are more successful than education ofproviders for improving vaccination rates. Little has been pub-lished on the long-term success and durability of such efforts.METHODS : We performed a 10-year time-series study to ex- amine the durability and success of an ongoing, multifaceted,institution-wide influenza and pneumococcal vaccination pro-gram. The program was rst implemented at the MinneapolisDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center in1987- 88 following the demonstration that a clinic-based stand-ing order policy was much more successful than provider edu-cation for improving vaccine delivery. The program ensuresthat vaccine is offered to all high-risk patients followed up at themedical center, promotes convenient access for patients, andfacilitates efcient administration of vaccine. Specic elementsinclude an annual mailing to patients, standing orders fornurses, walk-in clinics, and the use of standardized, preprinteddocumentation forms. Initially the program targeted high-riskoutpatients for influenza vaccination. It was extended to in-clude inpatients in 1989 -90. Pneumococcal vaccinations wereadded to the program in 1994 -95. Vaccination rates are esti-mated each year from surveys mailed to randomly selected pa-tients, and vaccine utilization is monitored through pharmacylogs.RESULTS: The survey response rates have exceeded 75% eachyear. Influenza vaccination rates for all high-risk patients fol- lowed up at the medical center have increased from 58% follow-ing the 1987- 88 vaccination season to 84% in 1996 -97 ( P, 0.001). Pneumococcal vaccination also 63% in 1996 P,0.001). Vacci- nation rates are similar for inpatients and outpatients, but ratesfor high-risk patients ,65 years of age remain lower than for the elderly: 69% versus 89% for influenza, pneumococcal, 1996 -97 ( P5 0.05). For elderly patients followed up at medical center,influenza (89% versus 67%, vaccination rates signicantly exceeded those for the state of Minnesota in 1996 -97. The an-nual number of influenza vaccine doses dispensed has increasedfrom 10,000 in 1987- 88 to more than 22,000 in 1996 -97; andmore than 13,000 doses of pneumococcal vaccine have beenadministered from 1994 -95 through 1996 -97.CONCLUSION: This simple, multifaceted program that in- corporates administrative and organizational strategies to en-hance influenza and pneumococcal vaccination rates has beenhighly durable and successful over a 10-year peroid. Similarstrategies if implemented in other settings may enhance vacci-nation rates for the millions of high-risk patients who have yetto be immunized. Am J Med. 1998;105:385-392. q1998 by Excerpta Medica, Inc. Influenza and pneumococcal diseases are major causes of morbidity and mortality, with each ac-counting for hundreds of thousands of hospitaliza- tions, billions of dollars in health care costs, and tens ofthousands of deaths every year in the United States (1,2).Despite the availability of safe and effective vaccines,many persons targeted for immunization according tonational recommendations have not been vaccinated(3,4). More than 40% of high-risk persons fail to receiveinfluenza vaccine each year and more than 60% of high-risk persons have never received a pneumococcal vacci-nation (5). Improved delivery of these vaccines could re-duce the burden of illness caused by influenza and pneu- mococcal diseases. Approximately 80% of influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations are administered in physicians' ofces (2). When asked, most physicians have adequate knowledgeabout these diseases and their associated vaccines, yetthere is a poor correlation between knowledge, attitudes,and actual clinical practice (6 - 8). Traditional educa-tional interventions aimed at providers may therefore failto increase immunization rates adequately (6,7). Knowl-edge about the \"facts\" is not sufcient for ensuring ade-quate delivery of needed vaccines. Organizationalchanges to clinical practice that support the systematicoffering and administration of vaccine to targetedgroups, on the other hand, have been associated with sub-stantial improvements in immunization rates (9,10). Previous experience at the Minneapolis Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center has highlightedthese principles for influenza vaccination of elderly andhigh-risk patients.

PII S0002-9343(98)00293-9directed at providers quadrupled vaccination rates of el- derly patients in the general medicine clinics from 7% to28% from 1983 to 1984 (11). A standing order policy inthe general medicine clinic further increased vaccinationrates to 69% (12). The following year, an institution-wideinfluenza vaccination program targeting high-risk outpa-tients was implemented, and 58% of all high-risk patientsfollowed up at the medical center were immunized (13).This program incorporated administrative and organiza-tional elements such as standing orders, a walk-in clinic,and mailed reminders to patients. In 1989 the programwas extended to patients hospitalized during the vaccina-tion season (14). That year, vaccination rates for high-risk outpatients as well as elderly patients dischargedfrom the hospital during the vaccination season exceeded70%. Many programs can be designed and then successfully implemented over the short run. Little has been pub-lished regarding the long-term durability of specic pro-grams or strategies. Previously we have reported on therst 5 years of our institution-wide influenza vaccinationprogram (15). In this paper, we provide an update on theMinneapolis VA Medical Center's experience that nowspans more than a decade. We also describe our applica-tion of the systems strategies originally employed for in-fluenza vaccinations to the delivery of pneumococcal vac-cinations to high-risk patients. METHODS Setting and Vaccination Program The Minneapolis VA Medical Center is a 400-bed univer- sity-afliated teaching hospital providing primary andtertiary care to more than 40,000 patients each year. In1986 the Medical Center developed a standing order pol-icy for administering influenza vaccine to elderly patientsfollowed in the general medicine clinics (12). For the1987- 88 vaccination season, an annual institution-wideinfluenza vaccination program was rst implemented atthe medical center (13). This program was designed toextend the success of the clinic-based standing orderstrategy to meet the needs of all high-risk patients fol-lowed up at the medical center irrespective of clinic as-signment while at the same time conguring a programthat could have long-term durability. Components of themultifaceted, ongoing program are intended to ensurethat vaccine is offered automatically to all high-risk pa-tients followed up at the medical center, to promote con-venient access for patients, and to facilitate the efciencyof vaccine administration. Specic elements of the program include the following: (1) an annual educational and publicity mailing to pa-tients followed up at the medical center that describeshigh-risk groups targeted for vaccination, indicates thatthe patient's VA physician strongly recommends vaccina- tion if the patient falls into a high-risk group, and in-cludes information on the seriousness of the disease, andthe safety and effectiveness of the vaccine; (2) walk-inclinics for vaccine administration from mid-Octoberthrough early December; (3) standing orders for nurses;and (4) the use of standardized patient information andmedical record documentation forms. These forms aredesigned to enhance the efciency with which vaccine canbe administered, especially in the high volume walk-inclinics. They include a section for the nurses to documentvaccine administration as well as a brief, self-adminis-tered questionnaire completed by the patient that asksabout possible contraindications to vaccination and con-rms that the patient has had an opportunity to read thevaccine information forms. In 1989 -90, the program wasexpanded to include hospitalized patients on the day ofdischarge (14). Elements of the Minneapolis VA MedicalCenter's influenza vaccination program have been usedsuccessfully at other sites (16,17). In 1994 -95, the institution also implemented a pneu- mococcal vaccination program patterned after the influ-enza vaccination program, allowing for the administra-tion of pneumococcal vaccinations during the annualwalk-in influenza vaccination clinics. In addition, duringMay and June of 1995, a one-time walk-in pneumococcalvaccination clinic was held during which approximately3,000 high-risk patients were immunized. Pneumococcalvaccinations may be administered by qualied nurses un-der standing orders at other times of the year as well. The goal of the combined influenza and pneumococcal vaccination program is to exceed the 60% vaccinationrates for these immunizations that are among the year2000 national health objectives (18). Program Evaluation Pharmacy data have been used to track by year the total number of doses of vaccine dispensed from 1983 to thepresent for influenza vaccine and from 1989 to thepresent for pneumococcal vaccine. Influenza vaccinationrates of high-risk patients followed up at the medical cen-ter have been estimated annually from surveys mailed topatients who have been randomly selected from the med-ical center's outpatient computer les. The validatedquestionnaire (19) asks about the patient's age, whetherthey received the vaccine, where they were immunized,and whether they have high-risk medical conditions(heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, other serious med-ical conditions). Mailings are conducted during themonths of February through March or April after theinfluenza vaccination season. The survey samples haveincluded 500 patients each year except in 1994 -95 when400 patients were included. Beginning with the 1990 -91immunization season, patients randomly selected fromthe computer roster of all patients 65 years of age andIncreasing Vaccination Rates among High-Risk Adults/Nichol 386 November 1998 T HEAMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE tVolume 105older who were discharged from the medical or surgical inpatient services during the immunization season havealso been surveyed with the same questionnaire. In the1990 -91 season, there were 300 patients in the inpatientsurvey sample, with 500 patients in subsequent years. Aquestion regarding whether the patient has ever receiveda pneumococcal vaccination was added to the outpatientsurvey for the 1994 -95 immunization season and to theinpatient survey in 1995-96. Vaccination rates at themedical center were compared with those estimated forelderly residents of the State of Minnesota (20 -23). RESULTS Response rates to the annual outpatient surveys have ex-ceeded 75% each year for the largely elderly and high-riskrespondents (Table 1). Influenza vaccination rates for allhigh-risk survey respondents (age $65 years or having heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, or other serious ill-ness) have increased during the 10 years in which we havehad the institution-wide program from 1996 -97 ( P,0.001; Table 2). Vaccination rates for high-risk patients less than 65 years old havetended to be lower than the vaccination rates for olderpatients: 52% versus 61% in 1987- 1996 -97 ( P,0.001). The highest vaccination rates have been observed among elderly patients receiving primary care in the gen-eral internal medicine clinic. Vaccination rates for thisgroup have increased from 69% in 1986 - 87, the year thestanding order was implemented, to 92% in 1996 -97(P,0.001, Figure 1). For all elderly patients followed up at the medical center, influenza vaccination rates also sig-nicantly exceeded those for elderly persons living inMinnesota (Figure 2A) (20 -23). Pneumococcal vaccination rates for high-risk outpa- tients have also increased during the 3 years in which thisvaccine was included in the organized program: from34% in 1994 -95 to 63% in 1996 -97 P,0.001, Table 2). As with influenza vaccination, pneumococcal vaccina-tion rates for high-risk outpatients less than 65 years oldhave been lower than those for older patients: 20% versus39% in 1994 -95 ( 66% in 1996 -97 ( P50.05). As with influenza vaccination, the highest pneumococcal vaccination rates were observedamong elderly patients receiving primary care in the gen-eral internal medicine clinic. For these survey respon-dents, pneumococcal vaccination rates increased from44% in 1994 -95 to 77% in 1996 -97 ( P50.003, Figure 1). For all elderly patients followed up at the medical cen-ter, pneumococcal vaccination rates also exceed those forelderly persons in the state of Minnesota (Figure 2B). Response rates to the annual inpatient surveys also ex- ceeded 75% each year. In addition to being aged 65 yearsand older, about one half to three fourths of the respon- dents to the inpatient survey had other high-risk medicalconditions (Table 1). Influenza vaccination rates forthese inpatient survey respondents increased from 79%in 1990 -91 in 1996 -97 (67%) -97 (69%, P50.70). Vaccination rates for the inpatient survey respondents have been similar to those for the outpatient survey re-spondents. In 1996 -97, influenza vaccination rates were86% for inpatients versus 84% for inpatientsversus 63% for outpatients ( P50.62, Table 2). In each of these settings, however, pneumococcal vaccination ratesdid not reach the same levels as for influenza vaccina-tions. In 1996 -97, 84% of all high-risk outpatients re-ceived an influenza vaccination while only 63% reportedever having received a pneumococcal vaccination ( P, 0.001). Likewise, 86% of the inpatient survey respondentsreported receiving an influenza vaccination in 1996 -97but only 69% indicated they had received a pneumococ-cal vaccination ( P,0.001, Table 2). Pharmacy data tracking the annual numbers of doses of influenza vaccine used since 1983- 84 and pneumococ-cal vaccine used since 1989 -90 have provided conrma-tory information regarding vaccine utilization in thesehigh-risk populations (Figure 3). As the program hasevolved and expanded, influenza vaccine utilization hasincreased. With the implementation of the general med-icine clinic-based standing order policy, vaccine use rosefrom 2,000 doses to 4,000 doses per year. With the rstyear of the institution-wide program, vaccine use in-creased to 10,000 doses. Since then, vaccine use has fur-ther increased to approximately 22,000 doses each year. The pharmacy data suggest that there was virtually no carry-over from the influenza vaccination program to thedelivery of pneumococcal vaccinations before the imple-mentation of an organized program for promoting deliv-ery of that vaccine. In 1991-92, for example, only 340doses of pneumococcal vaccine were used whereas 20,500doses of influenza vaccine were used. After the organizedprogram was implemented however, pneumococcal vac-cine use increased substantially, with more than 13,000doses being used over the rst 3 years of the combinedinfluenza-pneumococcal vaccination program. DISCUSSION Experience spanning more than a decade at the Minne-apolis VA Medical Center illustrates how a systems ap-proach that emphasizes administrative and organiza-tional changes to clinical practice to enhance influenzaand pneumococcal vaccination rates for adults can besuccessful and durable.

It has exceeded the program goalwith 84% of all high-risk patients followed up at the med-ical center receiving influenza vaccinations each year andwith 63% having received a pneumococcal vaccination. The Precede/Proceed model is one example of a sys- tems model for interventions (24). In this model, effortsare focused in three areas: (1) predisposing factors such asknowledge and attitudes, (2) enabling factors including appropriate infrastructural elements, and (3) reinforcingfactors such as ongoing measurement and feedback. Forthe successful delivery of influenza and pneumococcalvaccinations the major barriers are in the so-called en-abling factor category. Providers generally already haveadequate knowledge and attitudes regarding influenzaand pneumococcal vaccinations (6,7). Not surprisingly,an educational intervention directed at providers wasonly modestly successful at increasing influenza vaccina-tion rates at our medical center. Elsewhere, education ofproviders has also resulted in only modest improvementsin performance\u2014a phenomenon observed not only withimmunizations (25,26) but also with the delivery of otherhealth services as well (27-29). Administrative and orga-nizational strategies, on the other hand, can be highlysuccessful in improving vaccination rates (9,10) andother medical services (30,31). Measurement is an essential component of our immu- nization program, as it is for any continuous improve-ment effort (32). Providers who have adequate knowl-edge and attitudes about a particular intervention mayoverestimate their performance. Thus, an objective mea-sure of vaccination rates or vaccine utilization is essentialto establish the need for improvement. In our medicalcenter, we use pharmacy data about numbers of dosesadministered as well as survey data to estimate actual vac-cination rates for high-risk patients. Ongoing assess-ments are also necessary for monitoring the success ofinterventions and to provide feedback to program plan-ners and providers. Measurement with feedback of data Figure 1.

A health care provider's recommendation to the pa- tient is strongly and consistently associated with a pa-tient's vaccination behavior (35-38). Even if patients oth-erwise have negative attitudes towards immunization,more than 80% of such patients may be vaccinated if theirprovider recommends immunization (37). In our pro-gram, we emphasize in our annual patient mailing thatthe patient's VA physician strongly recommends vaccina-tion for persons in high-risk groups. During the 10 years of our vaccination program we have observed a consistent and gradual increase in vacci-nation rates. We have not observed a ceiling effect, as others have suggested might occur (39). Influenza vacci-nation rates for elderly patients followed up in the generalmedicine clinics, for example, are now greater than 90%. Interestingly, at our medical center there was virtually no carryover effect from the initial success of the influ-enza vaccination program efforts to the delivery of pneu-mococcal vaccinations. In 1992-93, 2 years before pneu-mococcal vaccinations were included in the organizedimmunization program, use of influenza vaccine was ap-proximately 60 times that of pneumococcal vaccine(20,500 doses versus 340). It was only after the formalincorporation of pneumococcal vaccinations into the or-ganized program that its use increased. This phenome-non again highlights the importance of measurement todene areas of need and organized systems that are de-signed specically to address a particular intervention.Pneumococcal vaccination rates are lower than influenzaimmunization rates in other settings (40) and even at anational level (5,41). Long-term care facilities are lesslikely to have pneumococcal vaccination policies andprograms than they are to have influenza vaccinationprograms (42). Likewise, family medicine and internalmedicine practitioners are also less likely to have organizedprograms for pneumococcal vaccinations (KL Nichol,unpublished observations). The failure to incorporatepneumococcal vaccinations into organized immuniza-tion programs probably contributes to lower immuniza-tion rates. Vaccination rates for high-risk persons ,65 years of age followed up at our medical center lag behind those ofthe elderly for both influenza and pneumococcal vacci-nations, as is also true at a national level (41). The reasonsfor this are unclear, although age-based vaccination rec-ommendations may be more successful than those basedon risk conditions (43). Additional strategies may need tobe employed adequately to reach this target group. Two limitations of our program evaluation deserve comment. We used a time-series design to monitorchanges in immunization rates before and after elementsof the program were implemented. Thus, there may notbe a cause and effect association between specic inter-ventions and the corresponding vaccination rates. How-ever, the evaluation has also included concurrent com-parison groups, including clinics in the medical centerthat did not incorporate standing orders (12), other VAMedical Centers that did not implement organized pro-grams (13), and comparison with statewide vaccinationrates (13). We also used self-report to assess vaccinationcoverage rates, the standard used in the Behavioral RiskFactor Surveillance System (20) and the National HealthInterview Surveys (44). We have shown that self-report ofinfluenza (19,45) and pneumococcal (45) vaccinationstatus is a valid and reliable measure. The simple, multifaceted program at the Minneapolis Figure 2.

The specic strategies that will be effective elsewheremay vary by setting and context. What matters most isthat some sort of organized approach be adopted, as thereare still thousands of lives and billions of dollars in healthcare costs to be saved. REFERENCES 1.
