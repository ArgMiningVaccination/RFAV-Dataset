The 'New India' needs to be a 'Healthy India' where its own traditional systems can play a significant role. AYUSH can play an important role in realizing the dream of 'New India' by providing quality healthcare and medical facilities for its citizens. Currently, a highly receptive environment for AYUSH systems in healthcare is recognized. Many reforms in administration, research strategies, nature of practice and education are already underway at the Ministry of AYUSH. With drastic changes in life-style, dietetic habits, increased industrialization, and pollution; global population of 21st Century is affecting with various kinds of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) that represent a leading threat to human health. These diseases are the world's biggest killers, causing 63% of total deaths. Unless urgent preventive steps are not taken, the situation may also lead to various complications and associated mortality. AYUSH healthcare strategies can play a major preventive, curative, and promotive role in such scenario and can play a pivotal role in community health. To make it more acceptable, there is a need to channelize AYUSH resources in a constructive manner. In this regard, a gradual yet progressive approach would be to identify domains where integration may have little or no scope for conflicts. In addition; The National Health Policy (NHP) 2017 has also strongly advocated mainstreaming and integrating AYUSH systems into National Health Mission, Research and Education. Thus, it is crucial at this time for Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports EDITORIAL Integrative Approaches in the Field of Healthcare: Way Ahead in the Benefit of Humankind How to cite: Nesari TM. Integrative Approaches in the Field of Healthcare: Way Ahead in the Benefit of Humankind. J AyuCaRe 2019;2(1):1-3AYUSH stakeholders to develop a strategy for effective implementation of NHP 2017. This integration could be visualized at three levels. 1. Knowledge integration 2. Service integration 3. Research integration Knowledge integration Knowledge integration help in identifying gaps in the knowledge and direct priority research areas that pave a way to improve understanding of existing interventions for various pathologies. Traditional systems of medicines hold huge information related to the healthcare sector. This information need to be collated and analyzed for possibilities of implementation among the cohorts by integrating with conventional sciences. Authorities can utilize this information in defining interventional strategies that will be cost-effective, sustainable that can satisfactorily address healthcare related issues. The authorities may think of initiating AYUSH bridge courses to understand the concepts and theories of traditional sciences by conventional practitioners and scientists that will pave a way to deal with NCDs, where knowledge of nutrition and lifestyle is essential. On the other hand; bridge courses to AYUSH professionals in modern medicine will strengthen their capacities to confidently handle and dispense basic medical care at primary healthcare level and also to integrate in National Health Programs. Knowledge of conventional diagnostic techniques will also help AYUSH practitioners to use them appropriately, thus buildup confidence not only in them but also in patients, other professionals, researchers and involved stakeholders. 2 Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports Volume 2 Issue 1 January-March 2019 Nesari TM. Integrative Healthcare Approaches for the Benefit of HumankindService integration Service integration in health care, often referred to as inter-professional health care, an approach characterized by a collaboration and communication among health care professionals. Such integrations allow translation of AYUSH terms into terminology easily understood by followers of conventional sciences. Focus on service areas of mutual interest that can answer the global health issues, further leading to design healthcare policies should be emphasized in such integrations. As, a little has been done towards generating evidences on impact of AYUSH treatment modalities in various pathologies; opening AYUSH clinics and appointing AYUSH professionals at higher conventional centres can be initiated. Specialized AYUSH services including Panchakarma, Ksarasutra etc. are the potential areas and such integration will be helpful in the management of NCDs and further dissemination of AYUSH potentiality at multiple levels. Low or minimal side-effects is often considered as a merit of AYUSH systems of medicines that is driving factor for its acceptance in the community and could be prioritized under preventive care. Initiating exclusive OPDs for Preventive Care with special emphasis on NCDs is essential and this is the need of the hour too. WHO has underlined the fact that safe and effective Traditional and Complementary Medicines could contribute significantly to Universal Health Coverage in various studies and documents, including the WHO Traditional Medicine Strategy: 2014-2023. In India, the experience with National AYUSH Mission in the last few years has shown that the AYUSH systems of healthcare have been successful in improving service delivery in the public health system. They have contributed notably to patient accessibility to health services, and also have demonstrated strengths in increasing awareness of health promotion and improving disease prevention. Conventional and AYUSH medical sciences, both make unique contributions in the healthcare sector, but both have their own shortcomings and limitations. The best approaches to integrate the services in a careful, and regulated way is needed. The Union budget 2017-18 has put forward the historic \" Ayushman Bharat\" program aimed at addressing health holistically covering both prevention and health promotion. Pursuing the National Health Policy, 2017 which envisioned Health and Wellness Centres (H&WC) as the foundation of India's health system bringing the healthcare system closer to the homes of people. It is visualized that these Centres will provide comprehensive healthcare, including for non-communicable diseases and maternal and child health services. In a fully functional AYUSH hospitals (like that of All India Institute of Ayurveda) supported with conventional diagnostic tools; the service integration of conventional systems can be limited (to about 10%) to manage acute and emergency conditions. Similarly, in an established conventional healthcare centres; the integration with AYUSH systems can be initiated to address the limitations. In such possible integrations, one should not look at the differences in between the approaches, but should look at areas where the integration can to help address the national health challenges. Research integration If Ayurveda is effective, then its ability in managing different disease conditions is to be showcased. A comprehensive custom to explore evidences on effectiveness in Ayurveda is the need of hour, that will facilitate generation of systematic databases useful to global healthcare. For this, a systematic plan is to be designed. The holistic approach of AYUSH put the patient as the centre addressing not just symptoms but the real cause of illness. Reductionist approaches doesn't suit in Ayurveda researches. Ayurveda has to be studied and investigated specifically adapting an approach in tune with basic classical principles. However, technical tools will have to be suitably adopted from modern basic biosciences developed afresh through intense interactions between Ayurveda and counterpart sciences. Integration with reputed conventional organizations is beneficial to achieve this objective. The limitations of singular health knowledge systems at the frontiers of medical and life sciences are being recognized. Thus despite the remarkable insights into cellular biology, the understanding of life processes at the macro level remains incomplete. Trans-disciplinary research, bridging AYUSH and conventional sciences is an opportunity to innovate and develop new paradigms for solving contemporary problems. 3 Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports Volume 2 Issue 1 January-March 2019 Nesari TM. Integrative Healthcare Approaches for the Benefit of HumankindIn the management of chronic diseases; a few integrative studies have proven that the holistic management based on Ayurveda, is as effective as the best biomedical treatment with lesser side effects. IITs attempted on establishing safety and efficacy of AYUSH herbo-mineral-metallic preparations. Such integrative research programs if pursued consistently; have the potential to create new paradigms in the medical science. Research integration must focus upon creating standardized treatment protocols that encompasses the principles of Ayurvedic diagnosis and treatment. Prospective researches on standalone AYUSH interventions, in association with conventional treatment, to prevent side-effects after conventional interventions, as preventive therapy can be attempted to evaluate actual impact of treatment strategies. In this direction; impact of diet and lifestyle modifications that aid patients' recovery should be studied extensively. A list of 'unmet needs' as noticed by different national organizations or WHO or industries can be prepared. A list of target diseases and therapeutics and measurable criteria for evaluation can be developed. Initially 10-12 disease conditions like Cancer (Breast / Prostate / Oral / Cervical), Diabetes, Infertility, Thyroid Dysfunction, Neurological Disorders etc. having high potential can be studied. The evidences thus generated can be disseminated among the global communities for further possible application in wider groups of populations.Challenges As the fundamental principles of conventional and contemporary systems are entirely different, it becomes a difficult task to define a roadmap and develop methodologies of their integration. It is right time for both the systems to initiate discussions to capitalize potentials of traditional medicine. Strenuous efforts are needed to address and meet the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly to Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. This is only possible with Integration in the field of Healthcare. Integration also supports in different areas of national programs including Cancer Control Program, Mental Health Program, Diabetes Control Program, Tuberculosis Control Program etc. Before actual integration; there is a need to identify gap areas that resolve the problems and generate a roadmap to develop awareness regarding AYUSH systems. Modern society should be in a condition to understand and accept AYUSH systems of medicine, then only integration is possible. Prof Tanuja Manoj Nesari Editor-in-Chief Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports (AyuCaRe) Institute of Ayurveda, Gautam Puri, Vihar, New Delhi - 110076 E-mail: tnesari@hotmail.com Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports Volume 2 Issue 1 January-March 2019 4 Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports The conceptual framework in which Nature and Science are interpreted depends on historical, cultural, social and economic factors. It is very well known that when comparing western and eastern perceptions of the world, different approaches are found: traditionally, for the West the attention is directed \"outward\" while for the East it is \"inward\", this leads to reaching a balance respectively \"outside\" and \"inside\". The perception of the \"outside\" is naturally limited by sensorial boundaries and it ends up in a fragmented view of reality, while the attention toward an inner primordial origin leads to holistic perception of reality. The practical result of the \"outward\" attitude is evident in the field of Modern Science, dominated by western culture, where scientists see Nature as made of separated items. These different substrates lead us to the diverse approaches to health and disease such as those of Modern Biomedicine and Traditional Medicines like Ayurveda. However, nature is one, notwithstanding the diverse human viewpoints, and a complete picture will result only from the collaboration of multiple perspectives. The tradition of Ayurveda testifies the existence of a deep disposition to Research since ancient times. [1] In this regard, the discussion exposed in the classical texts was essentially articulated on the validation of the knowledge processes as well as on the manifestation of diseases, the real efficacy of therapy and the development GUEST EDITORIAL Research Methodology for Ayurveda and Traditional Systems of Medicines: Practical Difficulties and Way Ahead Antonio Morandi, Ayurvedic Point, Milan, Italy dr.morandi@ayurvedicpoint.it How to cite: Morandi A. Research Methodology for Ayurveda and Traditional Systems of Medicines: Practical Difficulties and Way Ahead. J AyuCaRe 2019;2(1):4-10 of new formulations and protocols.[2,3] However, it was nothing like the Research as an organized activity, as it is intended today in the bio-medical field, this concept is something new for Ayurveda. Nevertheless, it is important to clarify that modern Research, characterized by the scientific method, is an overall new concept which has been developed in the West only during the last four centuries. In this framework Biomedicine, for the undoubtedly great progress focusing on organs and systems, but also for the huge economic interests that have accrued, [4-6] has become the medical system of reference of the modern world, and its reductionist based thinking is dominant today in the medical scientific community. In recent years initiatives of study, research and dissemination of Ayurveda's vision and philosophy have proliferated not only in India but in the whole world. Research in Ayurveda is flourishing and, according to PubMed, the largest database of scientific papers in the world, in the last seven years, almost 60% of total articles on Ayurveda produced from 1945 to the present have been published. [7] Not to mention the number of articles published in journals indexed in other Databases than PubMed such as DHARAONLINE or AYUSH Research Portal.[8-9] However, very few of them have provided valid information useful to reveal the underpinning value of Ayurvedic principles and their applicability to modern environment. Most of these studies have been performed mainly according to the requirements of modern Research in Biomedicine, without any necessary adjustment based on epistemological diversities, Moreover, most of these studies have been done Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports Volume 2 Issue 1 January-March 2019 Morandi A.: Research Methodology for Traditional Systems of Medicines 5in vitro or in vivo, with just a few clinical trials.[10] Besides, Research activities in Ayurveda currently don't follow a well-defined strategy, the majority of the studies is sparse and misdirected, and they are in large part guided by the urge of proving the efficacy of Ayurveda according to the epistemological framework of Modern Biomedicine. Furthermore, a relevant part of the studies are focused on ethnobotany and ethnopharmacology, in the strenuous search for information that could lead to the discovery of new chemical entities. [1] The assignation of the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine to Prof. Youyou Tu for the identification of an anti-malarial drug derived from a herb used in a traditional Chinese Medicine, is actually a signal of a potential danger. The event has been considered by many official legitimization for Traditional Medicine, however this is not true. It is rather the opposite, because this finding has been made using the conventional scientific method of drug discovery, neglecting the complex Chinese Medicine's pharmacology, its epistemology and approach to health and disease. [11] This could drive into a mislead enthusiasm in pursuing a reductionistic pathway even in the Traditional Medicine environment. This risk is very present also for Ayurveda. As a matter of fact, research based on the isolation of active principles and the search for the \"golden bullet\" drug is a widespread attitude present in the ayurvedic to shape community, which is reinforced by the glamour of modern science findings. This behavior, neglecting the very essence of Ayurveda's Dravyaguna, which uses complex algorithms to combine herbs and other materials in order to obtain a synergic effect, could lead to the progressive loss of the holistic perspective of Ayurvedic epistemology. However, in the last years a new wave of Research in Ayurveda is emerging and a novel approach is taking shape with the aim to establish a dialogue with Modern Medicine. [12-15] As an example, the recent molecular biology studies on the concept of individual constitution (Prakrti) on which Ayurveda focuses its diagnostic, therapeutic and preventive logic [16] are of considerable importance. The evaluation of Prakrti takes into account the constant interaction between environmental, physical and epigenetic components which contribute to shaping the individual phenotype. The full and proper understanding of the deep concept of Prakrti is therefore of vital importance for conveying and sharing Ayurveda's principles to Modern Medicine and Science. Several studies have recently highlighted the relationship between the Prakrti and the expression of particular genes, identifying the corresponding genomic basis. [17] It has been also analyzed the relationship between the Prakrti and the psychological personality characteristics measured according to Western methods. [18] Other interesting trends, that witness this novel cross-epistemological approach, span from the clinical use of physical and rehabilitation treatments to the management of chronic diseases and aging, from the elaboration of new models of health and disease to public health management. [19-22] Taken together, these findings will allow not only to successfully integrate the diagnostic mode of Ayurveda in the prevention and treatment of mental and social health, but also to develop a new vision of human functioning useful also to Modern Medicine. However, a conceptual coordination of these efforts and studies is needed. It is of crucial importance to individuate a novel strategy of Research and to develop a methodology which, while fulfilling the request of organization and coherence of modern Science, will follow the epistemological premises of Ayurveda. This will allow a real synergic interface between BioMedicine and Modern Science. However, it is important to have well clear in mind that the application of modern Research methodology in Ayurveda is a very difficult and complex task, since it is rooted on a different epistemological and ontological model. Research in Ayurveda is needed for several reasons: to complete the information that has been lost during the millennia, to better understand its principles and underpinning mechanism of action, to verify its applicability in present times and to understand if the synergy with Modern Biomedicine and Science can lead to broader advancements in Research, inspiring new directions. The latter, in my opinion, is the most innovative and promising issue. The epistemology of Ayurveda and its ontological vision of the universe is of high complexity and derives from Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports Volume 2 Issue 1 January-March 2019 Morandi A.: Research Methodology for Traditional Systems of Medicines 6 all the diverse Darshana of Indian Traditional System of Knowledge. It deeply differs from the epistemology of Modern Science and Biomedicine. They are two systems which are coherent in themselves, with their diverse point of view of reality and they cannot be overlapped. It is thus very important to understand why the application of reductionistic biomedical thought to Ayurveda is detrimental to its essence, and paradoxically prevents its deeper knowledge and possible applications. Reductionism defines the logical structure and methodology of Modern Science: according to this view the \"reality\" is explained as constituted of independent objects, consequently the capacity of controlling objects means controlling \"reality\". The essence of Knowledge is thus intended as formed by multiple units of information, whose single identification is considered as success. However, these units of information are kept separated by definition since reality is seen as formed by isolated fundamental components and not by objects interacting with each other. This hampers the perception of the dynamism of processes and of the whole interconnected framework of reality. The thinking underpinning Ayurveda is relational and systemic, every part is in continuous interrelation to each other and to the whole. \"All in one and one in all.\" Consequently, if the study of Ayurveda is performed according to the methods of Modern Biomedicine it will be distorted, it will be reduced, as it currently happens in many research studies, to a mere verification of the efficacy of certain preparations for specific conditions, or to the possibility of including only some of the ayurvedic techniques, pulled out from their conceptual context, in the current medical practice. In no way, by the very nature of Modern Science, the holistic essence of reality will be considered: in this view the ontological system at the basis of Ayurveda does not have any place, unless it is bent into the biomedical theoretical framework as well as methodology, denying its own identity as well as epistemological foundations. Research in Ayurveda must serve the knowledge of this ancient science, it should not be intended to confirm the limits of modern science and it should be performed according to the ayurvedic logical structure and not to that of BioMedicine. This is not to say that modern BioMedicine is wrong, on the contrary it is extremely efficacious especially in acute conditions and emergencies. I personally believe that the two systems are based on different epistemology and they shouldn't be mixed up in a confused manner. Let me tell you a nice story I heard in India, in order to better I understand my point. One fine day a child told his father that the teacher said that Sun rises at East, the father nodded and then said smiling that actually the Sun rises in a place that we call East. The child was confused and decided to ask his Grandfather his opinion. The old man patiently listened to the story and then told the young boy that in reality the Sun never rises or set. Who is right? All of them: it depends on the knowledge and on the level of observation. If I have to sail a ship I need to understand where the cardinal points are and knowing the sunrise and sunset sites is useful information, I don't mind about the motion of the planets which instead are important if, for example, I want to understand the dynamic of eclipses. The same happens for Ayurveda and Modern Medicine, they are related to different levels and they need coherent means to be studied and understood. In Statistics, the concept of validity is the extent to which a concept, conclusion or measurement is well-founded and corresponds accurately to what we feel is the real world. An argument is sound and valid only if the premises are true, thus the conclusion is guaranteed to be true. According to this concept, we need premises that fit together into a certain pattern that yields the conclusion. If we deny the ontological system at the basis of Ayurveda, we cannot expect true and innovative conclusion in our studies. Nonetheless, Ayurveda and Modern Science need to meet for the benefit of mankind. From their encounter a new, more complete perception of reality can emerge, it will be like understanding the relativity of sunset, sunrise and planet motion compared to the wholeness of the system. The debate between diverse epistemologies is the harbinger of new paradigms. The chaotic flow generated by the contact of two diverse conceptual environments when properly mediated, is potentially proficient and can generate a higher level of coherence between the systems engendering novel perspectives. However, due to the intrinsic turbulence of this cultural Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports Volume 2 Issue 1 January-March 2019 Morandi A.: Research Methodology for Traditional Systems of Medicines 7contact, it is a very delicate operation and it is of crucial importance to find the more appropriate way to nurture it. For this process I tend to use the word \"integration\" very rarely and with attention. In the last 20 years \"integration\" is an emerging concept in the field of biomedicine, since its limitations in offering solutions to many chronic illnesses have stimulated the search for treatment strategies beyond the boundaries of conventional health care. Many efforts have been made in this direction however we are far away from achieving the goal. One of the most important reasons for this unsuccessful result is the heterogeneous understanding of the concept of integration, which is influenced by cultural perceptions. Moreover, the rules about the development of this integration process have never been clear. [23-25] The \"integration\" of different medical systems and/or knowledge systems will be successful only if it is meant as a synergy, and not a merging, between the diverse approaches, leading to the development of inter-connections and the harmonious functioning of both systems. Unfortunately, \"integration\" is currently used as synonymous with \"assimilation\" and the majority of the integrative approaches rely on the concept of other medical systems confluence into the Biomedical model. [26,27] Since the participation of the two systems is not equal, this assimilation process, wrongly described as integration, leads to the eventual dissolution of other knowledge systems. There is a real risk of \"neo-colonization\" of Complementary and Alternative Medicines (CAMs) and Traditional Medicine. [28-31] It is thus very important to keep this risk in mind while proposing novel perspective of collaboration between knowledge systems and relative health care approaches. In this regards, some attempts have been made so far to promote the understanding of \"integration\" as synergic interaction, collaboration, rather than assimilation, [12-15,20,34] in order to preserve epistemological and conceptual diversity and to nurture a comprehensive view of Medicine and Science. This collaborative approach, based on a process of cross-cultural translation, would imply the effort to \"reformulate\" fundamental epistemological concepts in order to make them reciprocally understandable. This \"reformulation\" process could foster the discovery of convergences and similarities, as well as differences between knowledge systems, that in the long run could lead to the global enrichment of the overall medical understanding. It will generate a complex and comprehensive view of health, which will ignite the emergence of new paradigm in science as well as medicine. It is very well known that Ayurveda suggests to observe Nature using the concept of Loka purusha saamya, the analogy of Man and Universe, and this approach can be used in order to find optimal solutions to complex problems. Nature is characterized by \"Complexity\", where the many components of the system continuously interact with each other in multiple ways and collaboratively, creating higher levels of complexity and culminating in a superior order called of \"Emergence\", a novel state of the system, greater than the sum of its parts. In the economy of an organism, an higher level of complexity leads to emergent adaptive behavior while a lower complexity corresponds to a lower capacity of adaptation. [1] Adaptation is the key to evolution, survival and ultimately to Health. Concept beautifully expressed by Susruta \" As the moon, the sun and air support the cosmos with releasing, receiving and dispersing, likewise Kapha and Pitta support the body\". [32] As a matter of fact, chronic diseases show a lower level of complexity with difficulties in adaptation. In conclusion, we may infer that the collaboration between Ayurveda and Modern Medicine will increase the complexity of the general knowledge system leading to the emergence of a novel paradigm of science. Moreover, collaboration requires the phenomena of synchronization, rhythmogenesis and coherence, as observed in brain networks, [33] where a dynamic substrate of continuous cross-talk is at the basis for cognitive functions such as learning and memory. This proposal, where diverse epistemologies are bridged together, goes under the definition of \"Collaborative Medicine and Science\" (Co.M.S.), that we recently introduced. [34] The basic assumption of this novel conceptual framework of Research is quite obvious, and it is that we do not need to prove that Ayurveda works, because it does, history confirms it. It will be a waste of time and resources proving its effectiveness according to the parameters and framework of Modern Biomedicine, Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports Volume 2 Issue 1 January-March 2019 Morandi A.: Research Methodology for Traditional Systems of Medicines 8 activity which I also think quite humiliating and harmful for Ayurveda. Co.M.S. will instead coordinate and direct the research toward a coherent pathway, with the aim to understand Ayurveda, answering to three main questions: What, How and Why. What is working, How it is working, Why it is working. The answers to these questions will change the way we look at the world. This approach will bring to a paradigm shift not only in Medicine but in all Science. It is important not to limit the application of Ayurveda to medical field since its theoretical foundations, if properly contextualized and translated, have the potential to involve the entire scientific domains. The Co.M.S. strategy will kindle future research and activities to interface Ayurveda and Modern Science and Biomedicine through three main approaches which are closely interrelated: 1. Reformulation and contextualization of the Ayurveda fundamentals, 2. Ayurveda modelling 3. Localization of Ayurveda. 1. Reformulation and contextualization of the Ayurveda fundamentals This is a necessary step, the knowledge and wisdom of Ayurveda is deeply rooted in the classical texts. However, in my opinion, this incredible mine of knowledge is not exploited to its full potential. Many people, especially in the West use only English translations most of which are dated, incorrect or predominantly literary translations in which the true scientific significance is lost. Moreover, the very concept of translation of classical texts from Sanskrit poses substantial difficulties due to the cognitive system at the base of the Sanskrit language which is different from the Western one. In India, the situation still poses some problems since most of the times these texts are used only as references, with no real deep understanding and above all without making any effort for their contextualization. Today's world presents an inherent complexity that must be taken into account for the application of the classical texts indications. The relationship with modern science depends on this ability to reformulate the epistemological foundations of Ayurveda in sharable concepts. This \"reformulation\" could foster the discovery of convergences and similarities, as well as the differences between knowledge systems and in the long run could lead to the global enrichment of the overall medical knowledge. Finding commonalities will allow the creation of a sort of \"Rosetta Stone\" which will be crucial for mutual understanding and for going beyond the limits of current scientific understanding. This process could ultimately result in authentic integration, implying the harmonious and synergic co-existence of more than one system, rather than the merging of other systems into a dominant one. In the field of Medicine it will generate a complex and comprehensive view of health, which will ignite the emergence of new paradigms. Finding commonalities between Padartha Vijnana, Mahabhuta, Guna, Agni and the modern concepts of reality, matter, mind, time, energy are some of the fundamental challenges. 2. Ayurveda Modeling It is an application of scientific, conceptual as well as graphic modeling. It is an activity that is necessary to overcome the communication gap arising out of cultural diversity of the knowledge systems. The modern scientist will have access to deeper concepts of Ayurveda with reference to existing and commonly accepted knowledge. Ayurveda Modeling will describe and formalize in a logical and objective way the principles used in Ayurveda to interpret reality. It will allow simulation, visualization, manipulation and intuitive understanding of the entities, processes or phenomenons being represented. This will enhance individual and mutual understanding and create a reference point for sharing and collaboration. As an example, the recent representation that we made of Ayurveda through Complex Adaptive Systems offers a breakthrough vision of an Ayurvedic concept in terms congruent with Modern Medicine and Science. [20,35] 3. Ayurveda Localization Ayurveda, as the very meaning of the word indicates, is the science that deals with life in general and as such can be applied everywhere there is life, not only in India. However, if life is the same everywhere, the conditions in which it affirms and evolves are different according to diverse ecosystems and sociocultural milieus, leading to manifold expression of living beings and their socio- behavioural schemes. A traditional medicine is deeply rooted in the essence of Nature but it emerges according to the conditioning of the environment. Ayurveda in Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports Volume 2 Issue 1 January-March 2019 Morandi A.: Research Methodology for Traditional Systems of Medicines 9its pragmatic form is emerged according to the Indian domain, nevertheless also in India there are substantial differences, for example between North and South. This is the reason why the simple and general globalization of Ayurveda, as crude transportation of its practice through latitudes is not completely effective and accepted. Thus the principles of Nature, well defined and described by Ayurveda, have to be \"extracted\" from the Indian location and found and discovered in other local environments and Traditions. This task will be largely achieved through the previously described activity of reformulation and contextualization. Thus, the generalized principles of Ayurveda that will derive from \"Localization\" could be transported all over the world, applied regionally and used to interpret the local manifestation and expression of Nature. This will enable a versatile application of the principles of Ayurveda in diverse parts of the world, creating systems of healing that are suited to the local conditions and individual variations. Localization of Ayurveda is a fundamental concept for the realization of the primary goal of Ayurveda itself: the availability of its principles and benefits to everyone and everywhere. As stated in Charaka Samhita, Ayurveda never had a beginning nor it will have and end, as a logical consequence it does not need to be preserved. What instead needs preservation is the human knowledge of Ayurveda, our interpretation of it. A coherent Research keeping in mind Tradition goes in that direction, taking into account the need for Tapas that remains the basis of man's life. It is necessary for human beings to get to know and accept themselves and their position in Nature. This is a historical moment often dominated by confusion, fragmentation and uncertainty, and the proper research and diffusion of Ayurveda will surely help in finding a new cohesion in the vision of Nature and ultimately in the arising of higher human awareness.

Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports Volume 2 Issue 1 January-March 2019 11ABSTRACT Parkinson's disease is a chronic progressive degenerative disorder affecting the central nervous system and the motor functions. The closest resemblance to this in Ayurveda is Kampavata. As the conventional sciences have limitations in its management; traditional approaches for possibility of satisfactory management is being explored. The current case was treated with significant remission in the symptoms of Kampavata with the use of Madhu tailika vasti. An American male aged 60 years diagnosed by the western doctors to be suffering from Parkinson's disease since last four years. The disease resulted in loss of facial expression, slurred speech, robo-gait assisted by walking stick, disturbed sleep and psychosomatic symptoms like mild memory loss, depression, blabbering words, loss of concentration etc. After five weeks of Shodhana chikitsa (~bio-purificatory treatment) the patient had visible improvements. He could walk without any aid and could cycle for 20 min continuously. The progression of the disease was analysed using the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale. This case study is reported to reach to those 10 million people who are having Parkinson's disease and are unaware about the less invasive and more beneficial options available in the armamentarium of Ayurveda. - 4 1Secretary, Ministry of AYUSH, Govt. of India, New Delhi - 23 2Department of Dravyaguna, National Institute of Ayurveda, Correspondence: E-mail: vaidyalaxmi@ayu.in, Mobile: +91 9024902101Journal of Ayurveda is one among the Vata vyadhis (~Vata originating diseases) that was first described under the name of Vepathu having similar symptoms as that of Kampavata. [1-2] The symptoms include Karapadatala kampa AN. AyuCaRe 2019 2(1):11-16posture), Vaak vikriti (~speech also can be Acharya Charaka has stressed on Srotoshuddhi, Vatanulomana and Rasayana in general management of Avarana. Since this is a case of Kapha avarana; the same treatment modalities can be applied. Vangasena has clearly mentioned the treatment Kampavata Vatavyadhi; general line of management for Vatavyadhi also can be applied for the management. The Vasti which is having honey and oil as main ingredients is Madhu tailika vasti.[5] It is a variety of Niruha and can be given in all cases at any given time without any precautions.Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports Volume 2 Issue 1 January-March 2019 12 Kotecha R, et al.: Managing of Parkinson's Disease through AyurvedaCase Report A 60 years old American male, a computer project manager presented with gradual onset of anxiety, nervousness, disorientation, loss of facial expression, slurred speech, difficulty in constructing sentences and depression since four years. During 2010, the patient had observed gradual loss of sensing smell and difficulty in wearing gloves and sleeves. Progressively, his hand-writing, speech were affected. He lost the facial expressions and became vulnerable emotionally. He could not express himself properly due to difficulty in constructing sentences that made him less confident and depressed. Hi s sleep got reduced and eventually became parasomniac. In 2012, his gait got affected first on the left side and gradually right side was also involved, which resulted in festinating gait and unstable steps. Subsequently, he developed difficulty in standing up from lying posture and was forced to use a walking stick for walking and climbing stairs. He could no more continue with his sports like cycling. His daily tasks including urinating, defecating and dressing became difficult. He quit his job as a computer project manager that resulted in increased levels of stress. He was also presented with Amlapitta (~Acid reflux), Seborrheic dermatitis on scalp, chest, neck and face on his visit in January 2017. Patient Examination: He weighed 80kgs and height was 152 cm, BP was 110/80 mmHg, presented with mild forward stooping posture. He was non- diabetic and non-hypertensive. The Prakriti (~body constitution) vata, Madhyama satva and Rasa sara. Psychological status on the basis of MSE [6] and cranial nerves were examined and no abnormality was found. On physical examination, muscle tone, Samhanana (~compactness) and Pramana were found to be affected. His Vyayama shakti (~muscle strength) was examined via the physical fitness by asking him to do exercises, and was less than Avara (~sub normal). The deep tendon reflexes showed hyperactivity. There was no tremor at rest but mostly rigidity while writing and doing daily activities like adjoin the buttons of his shirt or folding the sleeves etc were noticed. His gait was affected (festinating gait), face was expressionless without smile even if he wants to. His speech was slow and feeble, and drooling was noticed while speaking. All these symptoms showed that the patient is having Avarana (~covering) of Kapha over Vata. [7] He showed faith in treatment and was ready to follow all the changes in his life style and diet as per the requirement of the treatment. Nadi (~pulse) was Vata kapha. Urine and faeces were normal. was coated. He was having Anushna sparsha (~not hot touch) and affected Shabda (~voice). His vision was not affected and he was moderately built. Purvarupa (Prodromal symptoms) According pain), which may restrict to one side of the body along with Avasada (~lack of interest / depression). Patient in this case, complained feeling of tension and restlessness. [3] The patient was taking Levodopa 25 mg and Carbidopa 100 mg since last one year along with Amitriptyline since last six months. But only temporary relief was noticed. Kampavata can be considered as a Vata vyadhi, so the general line of management of Vatavyadhi is applicable.[8] Panchakarma treatment was planned for five weeks starting with seven days of Marsha nasya with Anutaila (seven drops in each nostril). Since tremor, stress, anxiety, slurred speech were present in this case and disease is involved in Uttamanga (above the clavicular region), Nasya was administered for seven days along with Sarvanga abhyanga with Dashamoola bala taila as it is vashpa swedana for seven days and Yoga (with Mahamasha taila) for seven days. The other treatments included in this case are Patrapinda swedana made of Nirgundi leaves and administered with Dashamoola bala taila for seven days, Shirodhara with Ksheerabala five days and Kaya seka with Sahacharadi taila for seven days.

The quality of life assessed using PDQ-39 questionnaire that was found better.[15] The symptoms were improved considerably. (Table-5) He is continuing the oral herbal medicines that he took during the course of treatment and following the Vatahara life style. sour, salty pressure massage 2The food which is hot Bandaging 3Intake of lipids & unctous foodIrrigation 4Meat and meat soup Enema therapy, application of oil He stopped all his allopathic medicines during the Ayurvedic treatment and then after the treatment, continued the Ayurvedic medicines based on the follow- ups. No fresh complaints were noticed during follow-ups and he is continuing all the regimens and felt better. Parkinsonism is a progressive disorder, which will require a huge maintenance in terms of medicines and rehabilitation for the patient. Ayurveda has less invasive treatment which will definitely help to check the progression and give qualitative improvement. The need is to have a good treatment plan verifying the imbalanced Doshas and the willingness of the patient to follow the Pathyapathya (~do's & don'ts). Conclusion The case report reveal usefulness of Ayurveda treatment approaches in the management of Parkinson's disease. Particularly, Panchakarma procedures including Madhutailika vasti are beneficial in such manifestations promoting musculo-skeletal flexibility and movements effectively. It reduces weakness and impairment associated with Parkinson's disease. The drugs used in this study are purely herbal in origin with no side effects, easily available, effective, safe and good result yielding. This study shows that the patient can cope-up with the disease with the help of Panchakarma therapy and that Discussion Kampavata can be included under Vata vyadhi that manifests mainly due to Dhatu kshaya and Avarana in general. Basti chikitsa is one of the best treatments for Vata vyadhi. Rigidity and bradykinesia can be due to the Kapha avarana of Udana or Vyana vata causing imbalance in its functions. In the current case; Madhu tailika vasti was chosen considering its Brimhana, Balakara and Rasayana properties. [10] The ingredients included are Honey (100 ml), Dhanwantara taila (100 ml), decoction of Erandamoola (200 ml), Salt (6 gm), powders of Madanaphala (6 gm) and Shatapushpa (12 gm). [10] Nasya is said to be the best treatment protocol for all diseases above the clavicular region especially related to brain, as this route provides direct administration of the drug to the brain bypassing the blood brain barrier [11] Anutaila is having the ability to penetrate through the minute channels of the body, thus it is used for Nasya. [12] Protein diet in Parkinson's disease: The effectiveness of synthetic levodopa was found to be reduced with high protein diet. It is interesting to notice that Kapikacchu is of high protein 20-29% and yet very effective, based on which it can be said that its seeds are useful in this condition. [13] The levodopa and Kapikacchu with vegetarian protein, except Masha (~black gram) and diet free of animal proteins which are Guru (~heavy) to digest, Abhishyandi (~that clogs the channels of the digestive fire) and Ushna virya (~hot in potency) are advised to use. After the first seven days of Panchakarma, the patient started walking a few steps without stick. During the Basti protocol, he started gaining more confidence about his health and sleep was better. He started regaining his sense of humor and facial expression especially smile. He started cycling (10 min/day) and walking (1km/ day) after the 3 rd week of treatment. From the clinical observation along with assessment criteria (Table 2-4) including MRC scale, MSE scale; it is observed that the muscle strength, movements, speech were improved considerably. [14] Seborrheic dermatitis was also relieved. Bradykinesia persisted mildly but was better. His mood was better.Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports Volume 2 Issue 1 January-March 2019 16 Kotecha R, et al.: Managing of Parkinson's Disease through Ayurvedahelp in improving quality of life. Further studies with proper documentation are needed for the establishment of safety and efficacy of the drugs used. Considering the significant and remarkable results observed with the use of Madhutailika vasti along with other Ayurvedic therapies, it can be said that the current case may be a milestone in the treatment of Kampavata.

Inflammatory synovitis is the pathologic hallmark. Extra-articular manifestations of RA can involve several other organ systems and amongst them pulmonary manifestations is common and usually presents with pleural disease or diffuse interstitial fibrosis. A 50-year Egyptian male case of rheumatoid interstitial lung disease (ILD) which was treated on the line of Gambhira Vatashonita is presented here. The treatment given was classical Virechana (induced therapeutic purgation). Patient showed symptomatic and functional improvement after Virechana treatment. The 6-Minute Walk Distance (6MWD) was improved from 100 meters to 1800 meters within the span of 20 days. The oxygen saturation at the end of six minutes' walk also improved from 66% to 91% after Virechana treatment Introduction Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory disease that can involve other tissues and organs as well as synovial joints. Extra articular manifestations of RA are well known. There is no agreed classification for these manifestations because of increased variability in criteria and definitions. Pulmonary manifestations are relatively common in 6-10% and frequently present in early disease and all are related to worse outcome measures of rheumatoid disease, in particular functional impairment and mortality.

Amongst all the respiratory conditions; fibrosis and pleural effusion are relatively common [4] that occurs as a chronic, slowly progressive diffuse interstitial disease. The process usually involves the lower zones of lung. Though there is no clear relationship of severity of RA and pulmonary fibrosis; evidence of pulmonary fibrosis in lung function testing is approximately 30 to 40% of all cases of RA. [5] Clubbing is noted in up to 50% of patients with ILD. Crackles are present in majority of the patients. These are typically 'dry', end-inspiratory, and 'Velcro' in quality, mostly in the lung base. Positive anti-nuclear antibodies Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports Volume 2 Issue 1 January-March 2019 18 Patil RP, et al.: Panchakarma Lung Diseaseor rheumatoid factor occur in 10-20% of patients and are usually in low titres.[6,7] Lung involvement in RA is common and usually present with pleural disease or diffuse interstitial fibrosis. [8,9] Pulmonary fibrosis was first described in association with RA in late 1940s. [10] It is now clear that, the lungs and pleura manifest many different effects of RA. In Ayurveda RA comes under the umbrella of Vatashonita, where vitiated Vata mixed with Rakta and establish the disease. When it intervenes the deeper Dhatu, it can be considered as Gambhira (involving deeper tissues) type of Vatashonita. [11] As autoimmune disorders are concern, it is always having association with Rakta (blood) Dhatu. RA with ILD is having manifestation in Pranavaha Strotas, so consideration of lungs is essential. Keeping all this in mind, Virechana was planned in a patient of Rheumatoid Interstitial Lung Disease considering patient's Bala (strength). Case Report A 50-year-old Egyptian male reported with history of breathlessness, unable to walk without support, cough with expectoration, severe pain and swelling in major joints, back ache, fever on and off since four years, gradually progressive exertional dyspnoea since two months. Patient was on steroidal medication for two years. Despite of treatment with Corticosteroids, Cyclophosphamide and Azathioprine for four years, there was a relentless results in worsening of dyspnoea. Since last two months, the patient had stopped all medicines against medical advice. There was no haemoptysis or chest pain. On examination, pulse was 112/min, blood pressure was 114/68 mm of Hg, and respiratory rate was 28/min. Accessory muscles were being used in respiration. Clubbing and cyanosis was present. (Figure 1) Bilateral knee joint pain and backache as characteristic deformities of RA were absent. There were no palpable subcutaneous nodules, no purpura or neuropathy. Examination of Cardio Vascular System revealed normal audible heart sounds (S1 and S2), while examination of Respiratory system revealed bilateral diffuse coarse crepitation at lung bases. Per abdomen examination revealed soft abdomen with no lump or hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. Investigations: Haematological investigations revealed haemoglobin rate (ESR) in first hour. RA factor was strongly positive. Anti cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) 27.3 was positive (N < 20). Creatinine was 1.6. Cancer antigen (CA) 19_9 was 110U/ml (N value 0-39). Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was 8.33ng/ ml (N value < 5). Chest X-ray showed bilateral fibro- nodular opacities and veiling of both costo-phrenic angles. Pulmonary function test (PFT) showed severe restrictive defect and reduced diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO). High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan of thorax lobar and peripheral honeycombing, irregular peri-bronchial and inter-lobular septal thickening as well as ground glass opacities. The six-Minute Walk Distance (6MWD) also showed 300 m walk with the oxygen desaturation 66 % after 3 minutes with pulse rate 128/ min. Treatment: Detailed examination was done with Parikshabhava those are important for Panchakarma.[12] Patient was planned for Virechanakarma after assessing Bala (strength), Dosha (humors), Prakruti (body constitution), (age), Desha (region), Dipana and Pachana (digestive and carminative) drugs were prescribed with medicines for management of acute condition, as mentioned below for 15 days. Phase I- 1. For Dipana-pachana: Haritaki churna (powder of Terminalia chebula Retz. [Willd.] Miers stem - 2g) twice a day with warm water before food.Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports Volume 2 Issue 1 January-March 2019 19 Patil RP, thrice a day after food 3. Kanakasava (10ml) twice a day after food 4. Manjishthadi kashaya (40ml) twice a day after food 5. Avipattikara churna (5g) with warm water at bed time After two weeks, patient reported mild improvement in dyspnoea. After assessing the symptoms of Niramavastha (i.e. feeling of lightness in the body, timely feeling of thirst and hunger, feeling freshness, absence of coating over the tongue and regular bowel habits) of the patient, Virechana was planned. Phase II - 1. Abhyantara Snehapana (internal oleation) with Indukanta Ghrita dose (20ml, 45ml, 65ml and 100ml on first, second, third and fourth day) was administered. Samyaka Singdha Lakshana (i.e. feeling of softness in the body, presence of Ghee in the stool, increased appetite, and aversion towards Ghee) were achieved by fourth day. 2. Bahya Snehana and Sarvanga Swedana (whole body massage with Pindataila and fomentation) for four days was done. 3. Virechana (therapeutic purgation): Avipattikara Churna (20g) with honey on 4th day was given.

Conventional approaches to treatment include drugs with anti- inflammatory activity, such as corticosteroids and immuno-suppressives and cytotoxic agents, including azathioprine and cyclophosphamide and anti-fibrotic agents. Most treatment strategies nowadays have been based on suppression of immune and inflammatory responses. There are no pharmacological therapy that has been proven unequivocally to alter or reverse the inflammatory process in IPF. [15] However, Panchakarma can promote rejuvenation and can create an environment in body to fight against inflammation and immunity. Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disease, which can be considered under the heading of Vatashonita of Gambhira stage. In ILD, Pitta and Rakta can be considered as main factors in pathology. As the origin of lungs is explained as Shonita-kapha prasadam[16] that is Rakta and Kapha are responsible in the origin and are also responsible for normal functioning of lungs. So it can be perceived that vitiation of Rakta and Kapha are common factors in ILD and Gambhira Vatashonita.[17] As, Virechana is the advocated line of treatment for Gambhira vatashonita,[18] it was planned according to Avastha (condition) and Bala (strength) of the patient. Deepana was given with Haritaki ( officinale) and Guduchi (T. cordifolia) for two weeks which increases Agni and helps in digestion of Sneha taken during Snehapana. Medicines like Kanakasava and Sitopaladi in decreasing cough, dyspnoea and expectoration. Manjishthadi kashaya was prescribed for 15 days to decrease the inflammation and Raktagata kleda as Rakta is main vitiated factor in this disease. Sitopaladi churna and Shwaskuthara rasa were administered for instant relief in cough, fever and low appetite. Tulasi (Ocimum sanctum) swarasa was advised as Anupana to get enhancing effect in RA-ILD, where it reduces the symptoms of ILD and amplifies effect of medicine on RA symptoms such as fever and swelling of joints. Tulasi with honey is beneficial in Kaphajakasa.[19] It inhibits inflammation causing enzymes in body, that contributes to pain and other signs of inflammation. [20] Tulasi also exhibits innumerable in gradual increasing manner. [24] Its Shothahara (anti-inflammatory) effect can be supported by the properties of its ingredients like Latakaranja (Caesalpinia milk) and Goghrita (cow ghee).[25] Snehapana pacifies Vatadosha that subsequently decreases breathlessness and difficulty in walking after exercise.[26] (Table-3) It also softens various body organs, thus decrease in pain was reported during Snehapana. Sneha also helps in disintegrating cumulated Dosha or Mala that helps in bringing the cumulated Doshas from Shakha (extremities) to Koshtha (gastro intestinal tract) for their easy expulsion. [27] Just as water smears smoothly on oil applied utensil; in a same manner, Dosha smears easily in the oleated (oily or Snigdha) body which can be easily enters in Koshtha.[28] By Swedana, there will be dilatation of various Srotas and the flow is resumed that helps in eliminating vitiated Doshas.[29] Swedana relieves rigidity and spasm.[30] Thus, patient got relief in pain and breathlessness during resting period in between Snehapana and Virechana. As Pitta dosha was predominantly involved in the pathology, Avipattikara churna with honey was preferred for Virechana that is having Pitta rechaka effect. [31] RA can be treated under the treatment principle of Vatashonita. The efficacy and applicability of Shodhana procedure have been highlighted in classics with respect to disease management. Virechana with appropriate Vyadhihara Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports Volume 2 Issue 1 January-March 2019 21 Patil RP, et al.: Panchakarma in Rheumatoid Interstitial Lung Disease(disease specific) drugs can be used effectively in the management of RA.[32] Virechana eliminate the morbid matter that helps in decreasing autoimmunity resulting in decreasing symptoms of Vatashonita. The efficacy of Virechana in reducing clinical signs and symptoms of Vatashonita is also reported.[33] However, Virechana is the main treatment explained in the management of Gambhira vatashonita[34] and Shwasa [35] the improvement seen in symptoms may be due to the drug action at cellular level. (Table 2-3) The current treatment was well tolerated and lung function was stabilized over the month. (Table 4) After 20 days of Panchakarma therapy, the patient was less symptomatic and lung function showed a trend towards improvement. The 6-MWD was improved from 100 mtrs to 1800 mtrs within the span of 20 days. The oxygen saturation at the end of six minutes' walk also improved to 91% from 66% after Virechana. Vasavaleha and Indukantham ghrita were prescribed for one month as Rasayana (rejuvenation therapy) after Shodhana. Conclusion Virechana has provided symptomatic and functional improvement in the management of RA- ILD. The procedure also improved pulmonary functions. Thus, it can be concluded that Virechana is effective in patients of ILD by improving pulmonary function. However, well designed clinical trials including larger sample size is needed. References 1.

This is characterised by sudden onset paralysis or weakness of the muscles to one side of the face controlled by the facial nerve. In contemporary science, administration of steroids is the treatment of choice for complete facial palsy. A 17-year-old boy diagnosed as Ardita vata was treated with Karpasasthyadi taila nasya and oral Ayurveda medicines. Total duration of the treatment was seven days however significant results observed from day three. Shown almost complete recovery without any concurrent medications. This case is an evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of Ayurveda treatment in case of Ardita vata (Bell's palsy) and as a proposition for further research on more number of patients. Key words: Ardita, Bell's palsy, Karpasasthyadi Introduction Bell's palsy, also known as acute idiopathic lower motor neuron facial paralysis, is characterized by sudden onset paralysis or weakness of the muscles to one side of the face controlled by the facial nerve. Bell's palsy is an idiopathic, presumed immune mediated phenomenon, possibly with an infection as the inciting event. [1] The early effect of Bell's palsy is inability to fully close the mouth and eye on the affected side of the face, causing difficulties in eating and speaking, corneal drying and erosion. Later symptoms can include pain around the ear sometimes extending to the back of head or neck, altered taste, synkinesis, facial spasm, facial contractures, dysfunctional lacrimation and noise intolerance. [2] The resulting impairment of oral competence, verbal Ayurvedic Management of Bell's Palsy (Ardita vata): A Case Report Vitthal G. Huddar Department of Kayachikitsa, All India Ayurveda Case Reports communication and social interaction, can contribute to significant emotional distress during Bell's palsy.[3] About 71% of patients with Bell's palsy have motor function recovery completely within six months without treatment. [4-5] About one-third of patients may have incomplete recovery and residual effect. Among the residual effects include post-paralytic hemi facial spasm, co-contracting muscles, synkinesis, sweating while eating or during physical exertion. The two most common abnormal regeneration patterns are, lacrimation of the ipsilateral eye during chewing (crocodile tears) and closure of the ipsilateral eyelid when the jaw opens (jaw-winking). Based upon symptomatology, this manifestation can be compared with Ardita vata in Ayurveda. (Table -1) As per the literature, it is an episodic manifestation and takes six months to recover without any intervention. [6] Here is a case where almost complete recovery observed by administering Karpasasthyadi taila nasya for seven days, along with other internal Ayurvedic medicines. How to cite: Huddar VG. Ayurvedic Management of A Case Report.

[7-9] His physician diagnosed the condition as Bell's palsy. He had a history of excessive exposure to wind before the manifestation. Started with watering of eyes with mild swelling in the lower lid of the left eye. He consulted eye specialist for the same and prescribed eye-drops. No remission in symptoms was seen. Next day, he had sudden onset of deviation of mouth and weakness on the right side (Samutkshipteti atitwaritah). [10] Followed by inactivity of eyelid movement of left eye and difficulty in speech (Vaak sanga).[11] As per patient's report treatment was started with steroids for five days and advised to continue for another five days. As satisfactory results were not observed, patient stopped the use of steroids against medical advice before seven days of consultation for Ayurvedic treatment. Physical examination Higher mental functions were intact with motor functions of facial nerve affected. Deviation of mouth towards right side observed on clenching of the teeth. Mouth deviated on right side and leakage of air through the left angle of mouth observed on an act of filling of air in mouth. Complete closure of left eye was not possible and unable to raise the left eye brow with absent wrinkles on left side of the fore head, indicating the affected motor function of the facial nerve, however the sensory functions were unaffected. PathogenesisDue to the excessive exposure to cold wind, vitiated Vata with Kapha are involved in the genesis of the disease. Prakupita vata (aggravated vata) along with Kapha settles in Sandhi (joints of above clavicle) of Shira (head), Nasa (nose), (mandible), (eye). Snayu Kandara (~muscles) are affected by the aggravated Doshas and presented symptoms on the left half of the face with all the features of Ardita vata. This condition is akin to Bell's palsy in contemporary science, where the facial nerve palsy presenting with above symptoms is seen. Treatment: Treatment followed in this case is mentioned at table-2. During the treatment and follow up of 20 days, the patient was advised to avoid exposure to wind, sunlight, dust etc. Vataprakopaka nidanas (that exacerbate Vata) and advised to take rest. Observations and Results Clinical parameters: After 3rd day of the treatment, improvement was seen in reduction of deviation of mouth, watering of eyes, pricking pain in eye. After seven days, remission was observed in all the symptoms. (Fig 1-7) For Shamana of Doshas, the same medications were continued for next 20 days.Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports Volume 2 Issue 1 January-March 2019 25 Huddar VG.: Ayurvedic Management of Bell's PalsyTable-2: duration of 1Mukha abhyanga with Ksheerabala taila followed by Nadi swedaDay 1 to Day 7 7 Days 2Nasya with Karpasasthyadi taila 8 drops in each nostrilDay 1 to Day 7 7 Days 3Physiotherapy - proprioceptive neuro muscular facilitation techniquesDay 1 to Day 7 7 Days 4Oral cavity massage (oral cavity muscles including cheecks, tongue Ksheera Days 51.

Even though this condition is gradually resolves over time[16] needs proper and timely administration of intervention to prevent irreversible changes. Hence, in conventional therapy, steroid administration as early as possible is considered as the line of treatment. In the current case; treating Bell's palsy without continuing steroid treatment yielded complete recovery within seven days of treatment.

Treatment principle and rationale of treatment adopted: As there is association of Vata with Kapha, the Vata Kaphahara chikitsa is to be adopted. Navana nasya (putting medicated oil drops in the nostrils), Moordhni taila (different modalities of treatment of putting medicated oil over the head), Tarpana chikitsa (putting medicated oil over the eyes), Nadisweda (fomentations to face through the tublular structures), Upanaha (application of paste prepared of medicines to head) and Anoopa mamsa sevana (consumption of meat of animals residing in Marshy area) is the line of treatment mentioned for Ardita. [17] Based on this, the Karpasasthyadi navana nasya and nadi sweda have been adopted to remove Urdhwajatrugata doshas. To subside the remaining Doshas, oral medications combating and Kapha dosha have been selected. Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal) is observed to have beneficial effects on nervous system as neuritic regeneration and synaptic reconstruction and many more, used as internal medication. [18] Sameerapannaga rasa is considered to be quick control over Vata and Kapha possesses neuroprotective activity.[20] Possibly, a combination of all these formulations helped in breaking the pathology at different levels. Conclusion Navana nasya with Karpasasthyadi taila followed by the oral medicines in the treatment of Bell's palsy (Ardita vata) has provided significant improvement in this case. No conventional drugs were used during the course of treatment.

Few effects of sun exposure beyond those affecting the skin have been identified, but cutaneous exposure to sunlight is the major cause of human skin cancer and can have immuno-suppressive effects as well. [1] Photodermatoses is a group of disorders Effect of Panchatikta Panchaprasritika Basti (Medicated Enema Therapy) in the Management of Case Study B. Thakar Department of Panchakarma, Institute of Post Graduate Teaching and Research in Ayurveda, Gujarat Ayurved University, Jamnagar, a skin disease that is caused by exposure to sunlight. People with photodermatoses may develop skin rashes following exposure to the sun. This manifestation is most likely due to an abnormal immune system reaction to the sun. There is no exclusive description for this condition in Ayurveda, but all pathological skin manifestations are described under the heading of Kustha (~skin diseases). As, the symptoms of photodermatoses are predominant in Vata pitta, the condition can be managed accordingly. The present case of Photodermatoses is treated with Panchatikta pancha prasratika basti, topical application of Kaishor guggulu and Manjistadi skin). Considering the satisfactory results in the present case; similar strategies can be adopted in suitable cases of photodermatoses in larger sample size to generate evidences and disseminate usefulness of traditional interventions in the management of photodermatoses. How to cite: Rathore PB, (Medicated Enema Therapy) in the Management of Photodermatoses: A Case Study. J AyuCaRe 2019;2(1):28-34caused by an abnormal cutaneous reaction to sunlight especially to its ultraviolet component. [2-3] In Ayurveda, skin diseases are described under the broad term Kustha. [4] Excessive Aatapa sevana (exposure to sunlight/heat) is referred to be an etiological factor in the manifestation of Kustha, Vatarakta (~gout) and Visarpa (~erysipelas) etc.[4-6] kustha and modalities of Vata enema) using Panchatikta pancha prasritika yoga beneficial in managing Vata pitta pradhana kustha, as the components of Basti are Pitta Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports Volume 2 Issue 1 January-March 2019 29 Rathore PB, et al.: Ayurvedic Management of Photodermatosesshamaka and in general, it is best treatment option to pacify aggravated Vata.[7] Conventional medical system advocate using broad spectrum sun-screen lotions, wearing photo-protective clothing, avoiding exposure to sunlight, photo-sensitizer chemicals and drugs etc., [2] that can provide symptomatic relief. Despite of advancements in the medical field, there are no satisfactory treatment strategies that can manage the condition completely. Treatment approaches emphasized in Ayurveda are useful in such conditions. In this current study, Panchatikta-panchaprasratika basti is used to manage the case of photodermatoses. Case Report A 62 years of old male visited OPD with chief complaints of blackish red skin lesions all over body (~shyava-aruna Burning and pricking sensation on exposure to mid-day sun or heat was also complained by the patient that was existing since ten months. Daha (~burning since nine months and Utsedha (skin thickening) since six months were also presented by the patient. History of present illness Patient progressively started noticing burning sensation, itching and pricking sensation on exposure to sun on both hands and head since past 10 months. On rubbing the affected part, he started developing erythema and watery discharge. This was noticed by thickening of dorsum of both hands, feet, scalp and face. The case was diagnosed as photodermatoses by a dermatologist, who advised calamine lotion and sun screen lotion for local application with oral anti-histamines. After using for eight months; the patient stopped the treatment, as satisfactory relief in the symptoms was not observed. Consequent to this, the patient visited Panchakarma OPD for the management of the worsening condition. Sharirika prakriti of the patient was Kapha-vataja with Madhyama bala (~medium physical strength) and has (~good psychological strength). Patient had Krura koshtha (~constipated bowels) with altered appetite since last year.No history of tuberculosis, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypothyroidism, any other surgeries or chronic illnesses were found in patient. No relevant family history was positive for the same disease. On inspection, reddish black rashes with erythema and scaling on scalp, face, neck, chest, abdomen, upper and lower back, both upper and lower limbs were noticed. Hyperpigmentation and swelling of dorsum of hands and feet, lower part of forearm and leg were observed. On palpation, thick skin with induration on dorsum of hands and feet, lower leg, lower forearm, and roughness of affected skin was noticed. Treatment Initially, Deepana, Pachana was planned with Dhanyaka sunthi sidhdha jala. This was followed by a combination of Arogyavardhini vati (250 mg), Gudhuchi churna (3 gm), Khadira churna (3 gm) was given, thrice a day after meal for 42 days. This was followed by Kaishora guggulu (500 mg), twice before meal and Manjisthadi kwatha (10 ml), twice before meal for 64 days. Erandamula shodhana basti in first three days, and in continuation Panchatikta pancha prasritika basti was administered for seven days with above mentioned Shamana chikitsa. Go-ghrita for local application, twice a day after bath was advised to the patient since beginning of the treatment. (Figure 1) Erandamula Shodhana Basti For preparation of Basti, 60 ml Madhu (honey), 8 gm Saindhava (rock salt), 50 ml Tila taila (sesame oil), 20 gm Putayavanyadi kalka of Ricinus communis L. root) were mixed by following a specified sequence advocated in the classical literature to prepare a homogenous blend. This was made to luke-warm and administered on empty stomach in the morning using modified Basti yantra (Basti netra along with modified Basti putaka).Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports Volume 2 Issue 1 January-March 2019 30 Rathore PB, et al.: Ayurvedic Management of PhotodermatosesPanchatikta Pancha Prasritika Basti It was prepared by adding 100 ml of Go-ghrita in 400 ml Panchatikta kwatha with 10 gm of Sarshapa kalka (paste of mustard seeds).[7] This was mixed thoroughly and was administered early in the morning on empty stomach after bowel evacuation daily for eight consecutive days. During administration of Basti, patient was advised not to do exertion, consume easily digestible diet, take bath after evacuation of administered Basti material, and not to sleep during day time. Pathya-Apathya Ahara and Vihara: Patient was advised to avoid direct contact with mid day sun and any type of exertion. 250 ml processed boiled water with 5 gm each of powdered Sunthi (dry ginger) and Dhanyaka (coriander) was advised for drinking for 3 months for Deepana and Pachana (~increase of digestive fire and digestion). Patient was advised to take light of rice and green gram) in meal. Results Patient has started responding to the interventions and by the end of the treatment, all symptoms reduced significantly. Satisfactory results in overall symptoms and in general appearance were observed. Most of the symptoms were subsided after end of the treatment. (Figure 1a-7b) No aggravation in itching, burning sensation, scaling and hyper-pigmentation were observed. Post prandial blood sugar was 171 mg/dl which was lowered to 129 mg/dl after treatment. Eosinophil count and ESR were 17% and 40 mm/h respectively before treatment, while the after treatment these values were reduced to 6% and 9 mm/h respectively. (Table 1) Discussion The present condition is Vata pradhana kustha.[8] Excessive Aatapa Snigdha (~unctuous) and Drava guna (~liquidity) in the body. Laboratory investigations suggested pre-diabetic condition and raised eosinophils (17%) suggesting allergic history. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was raised to 40 mm/hr suggesting chronicity of the disease.Normal skin has several molecules that are activated upon sun exposure and undergo chemical reactions - the chromophores that are important for survival under the sun and necessary for our life. Photosensitivity develops when an abnormal chromophore, or a normal chromophore in exaggerated amounts, is present in the skin. When excited by a photon, these molecules suffer changes within the molecule itself, often within neighboring molecules, in a cascade of events that result in skin damage and inflammation. This can occur through direct molecular modification or production of free radicals, dependent or not on the oxygen. [9] In the present case, patient was suffering with Mandagni (~poor digestion and metabolism) since one year, due to which, there is a possibility of formation of endogenous photosensitizer metabolites that works as oxidizing agents or free radicals for the skin tissues, in this way degeneration and damage of skin tissues occurs in UV rays and even in normal sunlight. For breakdown of this etio-pathogenesis; first Agnimandya (~poor appetite) was treated with oral medicines and processed water. As Basti helps in removing Dosha from all over body, Panchatikta prasratika basti was given. Selection of been indicated in Kustha and Chaturvidha samshudhi is a type of Langhana. [10,11] As patient was Krura koshthi with altered Agni, which is a contraindicated condition for Snehapana; further Vamana and Virechana Karmas can't be performed without Sneha pana. Most of the symptoms in the current case were of Vata Mamsavaha srotodushti was noted. As Basti is the best treatment for Vata pradhana tridosha condition, it was preferred over the other Panchakarma procedures. Erandamula shodhana Basti: As the patient came with chronic illness with excess of Kleda (~clammy) and Bahudosha (~excessively aggravated dosha). Hence, three Shodhana in the management of Prameha (~diabetes mellitus), Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports Volume 2 Issue 1 January-March 2019 31 Rathore PB, et al.: Ayurvedic Management of PhotodermatosesKustha (~skin disorders) was administered. Besides skin lesions; as the patient appear to be in pre-diabetic stage and with the etio-pathology of Sanga type of Srotodushti (obstruction of avastha; Panchatikta\u2014pancha prasritika basti was selected treatment. Possible mode of action of Basti Kwatha drugs: Drugs used in the Basti are of (~strengthening skin and Aama pachana (~corrects impaired metabolism), Lekhana (~scraping / correcting of obstructed channels) and also helps break the pathology at different levels. Go-ghrita: Go-ghrita helps in eliminating aggravated Vata-pitta dosha. Ghrita also possesses Rakta vikara hara (~diseases due of blood), Vrana vitamin E and A, and carotenoids, which may be helpful in preventing lipid peroxidation preventing oxidative injury to the body, which in turn helps to rejuvenate the skin.[15-16] Kalka: Sarshapa kalka enhances the Sukshma (~subtle), Tikshna (~sharp) Guna (qualities) that help in eliminating obstruction of channels and toxins from the channels, ultimately evacuating through enema, giving a space for further formation of Shuddha rasadhatu (~quality nutritive fluid) that help in the formation of healthy skin tissue and skin layers. Shamana drugs Arogyavardhni vati, Khadira, Guduchi were given to the patient that are indicated in the management of skin disorders. Manjisthadi kwatha and Kaishora guggulu were selected with the purpose Rakta shodhana (~rectifying blood and its components). Arogyavardhini vati:A classical drug of choice for the management of Kushtha. It promotes Deepana -Pachana, Sroto (~removing toxins).[17] It balances the functioning of digestive system in general and hepatic functions in specific. It also does the Pachana of Drava and Kleda and does the Rakta vardhana (~improving blood quality). [18] Khadira: It has been appreciated for its usefulness in skin diseases. It contains Tikta, Kashaya rasa (bitter and astringent taste) that samkocha 19,20] Guduchi: Another drug of Tikta rasa pradhana and indicated in the management of Kushtha. The drug is Tridosha shamaka, balances all Dosha, Dhatu and known for its activity. [21,22] Cow Ghee (Go-ghrita): It is Vata-pitta shamaka, thus used for local application on the affected area of skin. It helps in covering the part that may prevent the contact of UV and other radiations. Due to its Vrana ropana property, helps in healing. [14] Conclusion Based upon the symptoms, photodermatoses can other Shamana drugs significantly relieved symptoms of Photodermatoses.

Wound-care is difficult to manage when it becomes systematic. In Ayurveda, wound-care is based on involvement of Dosha and Dushya, which can further be managed with topical applications and oral administration of suitable medicines. A 45 years old, diabetic male patient presented with an infected wound on lateral aspect of left forearm, associated with pain, pus discharge, slough, and raised local temperature since two weeks. He is advised for skin grafting by surgeon, but was unable to follow grafting considering financial constraints. Thus, the patient approached OPD, Shalya Tantra for possibilities of better management. This case was managed on Ayurveda wound-care principles along with topical application of Thumari ( Securinega leucopyrus) gel and oral Ayurveda medications. Wound healed completely within two months of regular wound-care along with internal Ayurveda medicines. This case report revealed usefulness of Thumari gel and Ayurveda medicines in the management of infected diabetic wound. How to cite: Ghodela NK, [Willd.] Muell.) Gel and Oral Adjuvant Drugs in the Management of Infected Diabetic Wound. J AyuCaRe 2019;2(1):35-38Introduction Healing of Vrana (~wound) is a natural phenomenon but it should be protected from various micro-organism which may vitiate the Dosha. This may affect the normal healing process of Vrana. Surgical interventions are usually followed in infected wound management that helps in eliminating debris and purulent material. Acharya Sushruta described vitiation of Dosha in Dushta vrana (~ infected wound) with Applicability of Thumari ( Securinega leucopyrus [Willd.] Muell.) Gel and Oral Adjuvant Drugs in the Management of Infected Diabetic Wound Naresh K Ghodela*, Tukaram S Dudhamal, Sanjay K. Gupta1, Vyasadeva Mahanta1 Department of Shalya Tantra, Institute for Post Graduate Teaching and Research in Ayurveda, Gujarat Ayurved University, Jamnagar, Gujarat 1All India Institute of Ayurveda, smell).[1] Most of these symptoms appear in Dushta vrana. Among these symptoms, Tridosha in Dushta administration of formulations that help Vrana shodhana (~cleansing of wounds) and Vrana ropana [Wild.] Muell) is an extra- pharmacopoeial drug, traditionally used in Sri Lanka for Journal of Ayurveda Case Reports Volume 2 Issue 1 January-March 2019 36 Ghodela NK, et al.: Ayurvedic Management of Infected Diabetic Woundhealing of diabetic wounds. Its efficacy in diabetic and non-healing wounds is reported.[3-4] Pharmacologically it possess anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant[5], anti-bacterial[6] and immune-modulatory properties[5]. Considering this, the drug is being used to manage wounds. Case Report A 45 years old male, diabetic patient approached for the treatment of wound on lateral aspect of left forearm. The patient had an injury some time back that was not managed systematically. A week back, an abscess was developed in the vicinity of the wound that was drained by a surgeon, who further suggested skin grafting after controlling infection. Considering financial constraints, patient didn't follow the advice and discontinued the suggested treatment protocol. Wound dressing was being continued, but wound was not healed. Thus, a week later, he approached OPD, Shalya Tantra for possibility of better management. On local examination a wound, exposing extensor fascia, measured about 15 cm x 6 cm in size associated with necrotized tissue, swelling, slough, and purulent discharge was observed. (Figure 1) On palpation, raised local temperature with tenderness observed. The case was managed at OPD by implementing principles of wound management as explained in Ayurveda. Freshly prepared decoction of Triphala (Fruits of Emblica officinalis, Terminalia chebula, and Terminalia belerica) was used to clean the wound, followed by dressing with application of Thumari gel over the wound. Improvement in symptoms was noted on weekly intervals. Triphala guggulu (1 gm thrice a day) and Manjisthadi kashaya (50 ml once daily) were given after meal for six weeks. During the course of treatment, the patient was using Glipizide (5 mg) and Metformin (500 mg) for the management of diabetes and was under the consultation of general physician. Preparation of Thumari gel: Primarily Thumari oil was prepared by following classical guidelines of Sneha paka kalpana (~oil preparation methods) using sesame leaves and Thumari decoction. 15% w/w, Aerosil was added to this medicated oil and triturated until the formation of a uniform gel and packed in airtight containers.Table 1: Composition of Manjisthadi part Nimba Azaridacta indica A. part Table 2: Composition of Triphala guggulu nameLatin name Guggulu Commiphora wightii (arn.) bhandariOleo-resin5 part Observations: On 3rd day, surgical debridement of necrotized tissue was done. During initial days, patient was advised to elevate his limb using arm sling. Discharge, tenderness and swelling were reduced and healthy granulation tissue were noticed in the affected area within a week of management. Initial wound contraction was progressed over incised area (made for abscess drainage by the surgeon). Regular aseptic dressings and oral medications (Triphala guggulu and Manjisthadi kashaya) along with oral hypoglycemic drugs and diet regimen prescribed by general physician were followed to control sugar levels. Wound approximated within two months with normal skin pigmentation.

Triphala kashaya is useful in Vrana shodhana because of its pitta shamana properties. Cleaning of wound with Triphala kashaya resulted in reduction of discharge and inflammation. Triphala anti- in normal pigmentation It also proved wound.[12] Intervention with all these drugs along with topical application of Thumari gel resulted in reducing inflammation and wound healing significantly. Conclusion Application of Thumari gel is safe and efficacious in management of infected diabetic wound. The gel found to be convenient to apply over such infected wounds. No irritation was reported and patient was comfortable with its application. Clinical trials involving larger sample size are needed to evaluate actual efficacy of the trial drug for the management of diabetic wound. References 1. Shastri AD, editor.
