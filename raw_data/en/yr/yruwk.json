You're not alone.", "sitename": "Psych Central", "date": "2022-04-26", "cleaned_text": "Research suggests that various nutritional deficiencies, such as zinc and vitamin B, are present in people with mental health conditions like OCD. Here are foods that can help. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition characterized by recurrent, intrusive, and unwanted thoughts, known as obsessions. OCD is also characterized by repetitive, ritualized behaviors, also known as compulsions. Some experts believe that the foods we eat can help manage symptoms of [OCD](https://psychcentral.com/ocd/ocd-overview). If you're looking for natural options to treat your OCD, you may consider giving your diet a second look to ensure you take in the best foods and supplements for you. According to the [National Alliance on Mental Illness](https://nami.org/About-Mental-Illness/Mental-Health-Conditions/Obsessive-compulsive-Disorder/Treatment), the recommended treatment for OCD includes cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and medication. But certain medicines can cause unpleasant side effects that may lead you to look at other forms of treatment, such as dietary supplements. Below are foods you may consider to help manage your symptoms. Foods high in vitamin D A much-needed vitamin, your body takes in vitamin D through some foods, supplements, and even the sunlight. It helps with many bodily functions, [including](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/) - absorbing calcium in our belly and bones - bone growth - preventing osteoporosis - reducing inflammation - aiding in cell growth and metabolism - improving immunity Foods that serve as sources of the vitamin include: - fish, like trout and salmon - beef liver - eggs - cheese - mushrooms - milk - soy milk - oat milk - cereal According to a [2020 review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7066598/) More clinical trials are needed to see if vitamin D supplementation can improve OCD symptoms. Consider speaking with a medical professional to help you decide if vitamin D best suits your needs.

Foods high in vitamin B12 While more research is needed, [studies](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lata-Kanyal-Butola/publication/353717256_Vitamin_B12_Deficiency_and_Psychiatric_Manifestations-A_Consise_Review/links/610c14381ca20f6f860427b5/Vitamin-B12-Deficiency-and-Psychiatric-Manifestations-A-Consise-Review.pdf) suggest a pattern between vitamin B12 deficiencies and OCD. They also recommend that doctors evaluate each person with OCD for a possible deficit, since it can affect brain function. Your body needs B12 to aid in its central nervous system function (brain and nerves), formation of healthy red blood cells, and creating and maintaining its DNA. If you're looking to add more to your diet, here are some [foods high in B12](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/) - beef liver - clams - tuna - salmon - beef - milk - yogurt Foods high in zinc Zinc is an essential nutrient needed for brain development and aids in digestion, among other things.

But a [small 2012 clinical trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22465904/) [fluoxetine](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322413) it can improve OCD symptoms.

Season the chuck roast with salt and black pepper. Brown meat on both sides in the hot oil, and transfer to a plate. - Stir carrots, celery, and onion into the pot, and cook and stir until vegetables start to release their juices, about 3 minutes; loosen any brown flavor bits on the bottom of the pot. Add butter, and cook until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Then sprinkle in rosemary, stir the vegetables, and return the roast to the pot. Cover the pot with a lid. - Roast in the preheated oven until the chuck roast is tender, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Season vegetables with additional salt and black pepper, if desired. Foods high in antioxidants Antioxidants could be a promising alternative treatment for OCD. [Research](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/omcl/2021/6661514/) suggests that [oxidative stress](https://www.healthline.com/health/oxidative-stress) contributes to your OCD symptoms. By taking in antioxidants, you help improve anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities inside your body, thus leading to better brain health.

Finally, squeeze over the lime juice and serve. According to a [2017 study](https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ben/lddd/2020/00000017/00000010/art00003), experts believe that inflammation in your brain can play a role in OCD. So, you may find it helpful to avoid foods that cause inflammation and additional stress on your body. Foods high in sugar According to a [2018 literature review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5986486/) - candies and desserts - sugar-sweetened drinks - baked goods - foods containing high fructose corn syrup - honey and syrups According to the [American Heart Association](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sugar/added-sugars) They suggest that most American women take in no more than six teaspoons of sugar daily, and no more than nine teaspoons for most American men. In a [large 2021 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34253560/) Other foods to consider eating in moderation include refined carbohydrates and red processed meats. Your mental health is an integral part of your overall health and well-being. Habits such as eating a well-balanced diet, exercising regularly, and getting an adequate amount of sleep can help you cope with your symptoms. Regular check-ups with your doctor are also crucial to maintaining a good bill of health. If you currently take medication prescribed by your doctor to manage your OCD symptoms, consider speaking with them to discover how you can incorporate alternative treatments in support of your medicine. If you plan on discontinuing your medication it can be helpful to discuss this with your doctor to develop a plan that will best support you.
