The Toronto Community Champion Award recognizes and acknowledges the extraordinary contributions that community organizations have made to support the health and solidarity of the residents of the City of Toronto throughout the pandemic. This award shines a spotlight on organizations across the city that made a positive and lasting impact on individuals and communities during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly those in most vulnerable areas and populations. Stories of resilience, perseverance and strength are worthy of recognition, for they honour the collective commitment and unwavering determination of our communities to support each other through some of the most unprecedented of times our city has ever experienced. The following organizations were honoured from over 260 nominations at an award ceremony on March 20, 2023, for their outstanding contribution to Toronto over the last three years. Etobicoke North York Scarborough Downtown City-wide Transforming Grief: Loss & Togetherness in COVID-19 exhibition is a free and accessible program that provides opportunities for people across the city to reflect on the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on recognizing disproportionately affected communities and those who continue to live with the effects of the pandemic. The exhibition brings together interviews, art and artifacts. They represent the collective voices of community members, artists, front-line workers, activists and volunteers, and convey how we experienced and continue to experience the pandemic. These are their stories, your stories and our stories.

The Burn is an interactive installation that provides a place for transformation, healing and letting go. From January 19 to March 11, the installation's vessels toured the city, inspiring Torontonians to set healing intentions on wooden spheres. On March 11, the third anniversary of the official start of the pandemic, a commemorative ceremony featuring The Burn took place at Nathan Phillips Square in memory of lives lost. It was followed by a 24-hour interactive public art experience and wellness programming. Ashes from the burn were harvested, and will be mixed into soil and spread across city gardens to honour the spirit of our collective healing.

From November 26, 2022, through February 20, 2023 (Family Day), an illumination of the Toronto City Hall towers was incorporated into the lighting design of Nathan Phillips Square. The illumination featured sky beams and gradient lighting features on the towers that symbolized and celebrated the collective response by Toronto residents to support each other through and following the pandemic. Light is a symbol of the vibrancy of life, and the lighting colours chosen for the Illumination installation represented our hope for the future, unity of purpose, strength in the face of adversity and renewal of our city and its residents. On December 31, 2022, the City marked the new year with [high-altitude fireworks](https://www.toronto.ca/explore-enjoy/festivals-events/new-years-eve-celebration-of-light-sound/) along downtown Toronto's waterfront.
