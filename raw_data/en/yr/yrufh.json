Therapeutic Class Overview Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Agents INTRODUCTION Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a serious neuromuscular disease characterized by the degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brainstem, leading to progressive muscular atrophy and weakness ( Genetics Home Reference 2020, Mercuri et al 201 8[a]). SMA is caused by an inherited genetic mutation, and is the most common genetic cause of infant mortality (Bodamer 2020). SMA is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder. The overall incidence is between 4 and 10 per 100,000 live births, and 1 person in 50 to 90 is a carrier of a mutation that can cause SMA ( Bodamer 2020). The SMN1 gene i s responsible for the production of SMN protein, which is ubiquitously expressed in all cells throughout fetal and post -natal development. Deletion or mutations in the SMN1 gene le ad to a shortage of the protein. Without this protein, motor neurons degener ate and nerve impulses are not carried between the brain and muscles , resulting in characteristic muscle weakness and impaired movement (Bodamer 2020 , Finkel et al 2018, Genetics Home Reference 2020). There is also a modifying (or \"backup\") gene called SMN2, which generates a smaller amount of functional SMN protein. The number of SMN2 gene copies varies among individuals, and patients with a higher number of SMN2 gene copies tend to have a less sever e SMA type ( Bodamer 2020, Calucho et al 2018). There are several forms of SMA with varying degrees of severity and ages of onset ( Bodamer 2020, Genetics Home Reference 2020, Glascock et al 2018, , Rao et al 2018 ). In SMA type 1, untreated patients have severe weakness and hypotonia and never gain the ability to sit unsupported. Patients with SMA type 1 typically have an onset of symptoms between the age of 0 and 6 months, and have a typical lifespan of < 2 years without permanent ventilation. Patients with SMA type 2 (intermediate), 3 (mild), or 4 (adult -onset) experience a later onset and less severe symptoms usually characterized by varying degrees of muscle weakness. Type 0 (prenatal) is the rarest and most severe form, with ne wborns typically living for < 6 months. SMA type 1 is the most common form, affecting approximately 58% of patients. Type 2 and t ype 3 occur in approximately 29% and 13% of patients, respectively, and type 4 is less common (< 5%) ( Food and Drug Administration [FDA] medical review 2016 ). Mothers may notice a decrease of fetal movement in late pregnancy, and some experts classify prenatal onset as type 0 SMA, which is very rare ( Bodamer 2020, FDA medical review 2016). Management of SMA has historically been limited to supportive measures, focusing on providing nutrition and respiratory assistance and preventing or treating the complications of weakness. Nonpharmacologic treatments include physical therapy, spinal bracing, chest physiotherapy, and respiratory support ( Bodamer 2020, Finkel et al 2018, Mercuri et al 2018[a] ). In December 2016, Spinraza (nusinersen) became the first FDA -approved product for the treatment of SMA. The FDA granted nusinersen F ast Track designation, O rphan Drug designation, and P riority Review ( FDA 2016). Nusinersen is an antisense oligonucleotide designed to treat SMA caused by mutations in chromosome 5q that leadto SMN protein deficiency. Nusinersen binds to sites within SMN2 pre-mRNA, promoting inclusion of exon 7 in SMN2 mRNA transcripts and increasing production of full -length, functional ( Finkel et referred to as onasemnogene abeparvovec), approved by the FDA in May 2019, is the second FDA-approved product for the treatment of SMA . Onasem nogene abeparvovec was granted Priority Review by the FDA, and received Breakthrough Therapy, Fast Track, and Orphan Drug designations ( FDA 2019). Onasemnogene abeparvovec is a gene therapy that uses a viral vector to deliver a copy of the gene encoding thehuman SMN protein. The virus enters the nucleus of neurons and forms an episome (a DNA molecule that replicatesindependently of chromosomal DNA). The episome is transcribed and translated to produce the missing SMN protein. Evrysdi (risdiplam) , approved by the FDA in August 2020, is the third FDA-approved product for the treatment of SMA. Risdiplam was granted Priority Review by the FDA, and received Fast Track and Orphan Drug designations. Risdiplam is a splicing modifier that increases exon 7 inclusion in the SMN2 mRNA transcripts, thereby increasing production of full -length SMN protein ( Evrysdi prescribing information 2020).Data as of September 22, 2020 RLP/AKS Page 32 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx .

The use of onasemnogene abeparvovec in patients with advanced SMA (eg, complete paralysis of limbs, permanent ventilator dependence) has not been evaluated. Inform ation on indications, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, dosing, and safety has been obtained from the prescribing information for the individual products, except where noted otherwise. CLINICAL EFFICACY SUMMARY Zolgensma (onasemnogene abeparvovec -xioi) The safety and efficacy of onasemnogene abeparvovec were evaluated in 3 clinical trials, START, STR1VE and SPR1NT. START was a phase 1, open- label trial of 15 patients with SMA type 1 who had 2 copies of SMN2. Two cohorts were treated: 3 patients in cohort 1 received a low dose of Zolgensma, while 12 patients in cohort 2 received a high dose of Zolgensma. After 24 months of treatment, all patients in cohort 2 were alive and none required permanent ventilati on (described as 16 hours per day of required ventilatory support for 14 consecutive days in the absence of acute reversible illness or perioperative change). One patient in group 1 reached a pulmonary event at 28.8 months of age. Patients also had improvement in meeting certain motor milestones, with the majority gaining the ability to sit unassisted, roll over, and achieve head control. Gains in the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP- INTEND) were also noted ( Al-Zaidy et al 2019, Mendell et al 2017) . Ten of the 12 patients in cohort 2 enrolled in the START long- term follow -up (LTFU) study. As of December 31, 2019, all 10 patients were alive and free of permanent ventilation, no previously -achieved motor milestone had been lost, and 2 patients gained a new milestone of standing with assistance. There were no new treatment -related serious adverse effects ( AEs) and no AEs of special interest during the LTFU study. Some of the patients in the LTFU study have received subsequent therapy with nusinersen ( Novartis ). STR1VE was an open- arm, multicenter trial in the U.S that evaluat ed the safety and efficacy of Zolgensma in patients with SMA type 1 who were < 6 months of age at the time of gene therapy, with 1 or 2 copies of SMN2 and who had bi-allelic SMN1 gene deletion or point mutations. Data as of March 8, 2019 (median duration of follow -up, 10.2 months) show ed that of 20 patients who reached 10.5 months of age or discontinued the study prior to 10.5 months of age, 19 (95%) were surviving without permanentData as of September 22, 2020 RLP/AKS Page 33 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx .

Of 15 patients who had reached 13.6 months of age or discontinued prior to 13.6 months, 13 (87%) were surviving without permanent ventilation ( Day et al 2019). According to updated data provided by the manufacturer in March 2020, 20 of 22 patients (91%) met the co- primary endpoint of event -free survival at 14 months, and 13 of 22 patients (59%) met the co- primary endpoint of functional sitting for 30 seconds at 18 months of age. Sustained improvements in CHOP- INTEND scores were also noted (Novartis 2020[a]). SPR1NT is an ongoing, Phase 3, open- label, single -arm, multicenter trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Zolgensma in pre- symptomatic patients with SMA and 2 or 3 copies of SMN2 who were 6 weeks of age. The primary outcome measure for patients with 2 copies of SMN2 is independent sitting for 30 seconds by 18 months. The primary outcome measure for patients with 3 copies of SMN2 is standing without support for at least 3 seconds by 24 months (Avexis 2019, Strauss et al 2019) . As of December 31, 2019, 14 patients with 2 copies of SMN2 and 15 patients with 3 copies of SMN2 had been treated. In the 2- copy cohort, 8 patients so far were able to sit independently for 30 seconds (range, 5.7 to 11.8 months of age), and 4 patients were able to walk independently. Of the patients with 3 copies of SMN2 , 4 patients were able to stand alone without support for 3 seconds (9.5 to 12.4 months of age) and 3 patients were able to walk independently (12.2 to 15.1 months of age). Patients in both cohorts who had not achieved these milestones yet were still wit hin the normal age development window for these milestones (Novartis 2020[a] ). Zolgensma is still being studied in a number of trials in pursuit of expanding patient populations. Of note, t he STRONG trial is a Phase 1 trial investigating intrathecal delivery in children with SMA type 2 aged 6 months to 5 years(Clinicaltrials.gov 2020). Based on their review of data from STRONG, the FDA has notified the manufacturer that they recommend a pivotal confirmatory study to supplement the STRONG data in order to s upport a regulatory submission for intrathecal use (Novartis 2020[b]) . Spin raza (nusinersen) Key clinical trials supporting the safety and efficacy of nusinersen include ENDEAR, CHERISH, and NURTURE . The pivotal trial ENDEAR (N = 121) was a 13 -month, P hase 3, randomized, sham- controlled, double- blind, multicenter trial in patients 7 months or younger who had an onset of SMA symptoms at 6 months of age and had homozygous deletion or mutation of SMN1 and 2 copies of the SMN2 gene ( Finkel et al 2017). At interim analysis, a higher proportion of patients treated with nusinersen had a motor milestone response than those in the control group (41% vs 0% , p < 0.001) , prompting early termination of the trial . The final analysis showed that 51% of the nusinersen- treated group had a motor milestone response, compared with no patients in the control group. M otor milestones reached included achievement of full head control (22%), ability to roll over (10%), ability to sit independently (8%), and ability to stand (1% ). A co-primary endpoint of event -free survival also favored nusinersen vs placebo (61% vs 32% ; p = 0.005). Patients in the nusinersen group also had a 63% lower risk of death compared with the control group (hazard ratio, 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.18 to 0.77; p = 0.004). CHERISH (N = 126) was a Phase 3, randomized, sham- controlled, double- blind , multicenter trial in patients aged 2 to 12 years with later -onset SMA . The primary endpoint was the least -squares mean change from baseline in the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale- Expanded (HFMSE) score at 15 months of treatment ( Mercuri 2018[b ]). In the pre-planned interim analysis, there was a significant improvement in the H FMSE from baseline to 15 months in the nusinersen group vs the control group (mean difference in change, 5.9 points; 95% CI, 3.7 to 8.1; p < 0.001). Results of the final analysis were consistent with results of the interim analysis. In the final analysis, 57% of the children in the nusinersen group vs 26% in the control group had an increase from baseline to month 15 in theHFMSE score of at least 3 points ( p < 0.001), and the overall incidence of AEs was similar in the nusinersen group and the control group (93% vs 100%, respectively). The NURTURE study is an ongoing, Phase 2, open- label , single -arm trial to evaluate the use of nusinersen in patients w ith SMA and 2 or 3 copies of SMN2 who were 6 weeks of age and asymptomatic at the time of treatment initiation The primary endpoint was time to death or respiratory intervention (invasive or non- invasive for 6 hours per day continuously for 7 days or tracheostomy) . At an interim analysis published in 2019, 25 patients had been enrolled, of whom 15 had 2 SMN2 copies and 10 had 3 SMN2 copies . At the time of the interim analysis, 4 participants (16%) had utilized a respiratory intervention. A ll patients were alive and none required permanent ventilation. Efficacy was further supported by the achievement of motor milestones by HINE -2 and motor function by CHOP -INTEND. Of note, all patients achieved the milestone of \"sitting without support\" and 23 of 25 patients (92%) achieved \"walking with assistance\" (De Vivo et al 2019 ).Data as of September 22, 2020 RLP/AKS Page 34 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx .

Clinicians should refer t o the full prescribing i nformati on and publ ished resources when making m edical de cisions. In June 2020, the manufacturer reported updated data noting that all children treated pre- symptomatically were alive and none required permanent ventilation after up to 4.8 years of continuous treatment . In addition, patients continued to maintain and make progressive gains in motor function. The study has been extended by an additional 3 years to allow the collection of continued data ( Biogen 2020). The FDA -approved indication for nusinersen does not limit its use to certain ages or SMA types. The FDA medical review noted that the underlying cause of SMA (a shortage of SMN protein) is common to patients with all SMA types,and it is reasonable to expect that nusinersen should provide clinical benefits in all SMA types . Open- label studies included patients 2 to 17 years of age with 2 to 5 SMN2 copies and symptom onset corresponding to types 2 and 3 SMA; these results plus the initial summary of the sham- controlled trial in later -onset patients support the conclusion that nusinersen provides clinical benefits to patients with types 2 and 3 SMA and allow reasonable extrapolation to thesepopulations. Given the invasive nature of nusinersen administration, patients with milder forms of SMA (type 4) may need to weigh potential benefits, risks and discomfort, and relative symptom severity to make individual treatmentdecisions ( FDA medical review 2016). Evrysd i (risdiplam) Evidence for the safety and efficacy of risdiplam is available from results of 2 clinical trials, FIREFISH and SUNFISH . Both studies ar e still ongoing. FIREFISH is a 2-part, Phase 2/3, open- label, multicenter, dose- escalation study assessing the safety and tolerability of risdiplam in infantile- onset SMA type 1 patients aged 1 to 7 months . In part 1, 21 infants were assigned to group A (n = 4) receiving a low dose or group B (n = 17) recieiving a high dose that was adjusted up to the recommended dose of 0.2 mg/kg/day . Of the infants who were treated with the recommended dosage of risdiplam 0.2 mg/kg/day, 7 of 17 ( 41%) were able to sit independently for 5 seco nds as assess ed by the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler development Third Edition ( BSID -III) after 12 months of treatment, a milestone beyond that expected in the natural history of the disease. Additionally, 90% of patients (19/21) were alive without permanent ventilation (and reached 15 months of age or older) (Evrysdi prescribing information 2020) . The most common AEs included pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infections, rash, diarrhea, vomiting, pneumonia and constipation ( Evrysdi AMCP Dossier 2020). The manufacturer announced 2- year data for FIREFISH part 1, noting t hat an estimated 88% of patients were alive and required no permanent ventilation after 2 years . Patients continued to achieve motor milestones, including 59% (10/17) sitting without support for 5 seconds, 65% (11/17) maintaining upright head control, 29% (5/17) turning over, and 30% (5/17) standing either supporting weight or with support. No new safety signalswere identified (Genentech 2020). Part 2 is a pivotal single- arm study evaluating the use of risdiplam in 41 infants with SMA type 1 for 24 months . Infants received risdiplam at a dose of 5 mg once daily for patients with a body weight 20 kg or 0.25 mg/kg for patients with a body weight < 20 kg. The primary outcome is the proportion of infants sitting without support for 5 seconds after 12 months on treatment as assessed by BSID -III. A primary analysis at 12 months (November 2019) showed that 12/41 infants (29%; 90% CI , 17.8% to 43.1%) were sitting without support for 5 seconds. After 24 months in part 2, infants will continue in a open-l abel extension phase ( Evrysdi AMCP Dossier 2020). SUNFISH is a 2 -part, double- blind, placebo- controlled trial in children and young adults age d 2 to 25 years old with SMA type 2 and 3 (Evrysdi AMCP Dossier 2020). Part 1 (N = 51) was a dose- finding phase evaluating safety and tolerability of risdiplam. Patients received risdiplam or placebo for a minimum of 12 weeks, followed by open- label use of risdiplam at the dose selected for Part 2. Exploratory results at 12 months showed improvem ents in motor function compared to natural history . In Part 2, 180 patients were randomized (type 2, 71%; type 3, 29%) to risdiplam or placebo for 24 months followed by an open- label extension period. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in motor function measure 32 scale (MFM- 32) at month 12; the average baseline MFM- 32 score was 45 in the risdiplam group vs 47 in the placebo group. The primary analysis showed a statistically significant 1.36- point increase from baseline MFM- 32 score in the risdiplam group (95% CI , 0.61 to 2.11) compared to a - 0.19- point change in the placebo group (95% CI, -1.22 to 0.84). The most common AEs that occurred in > 10% of risdiplam -treated patients and more commonly than with placebo were fever , diarrhea, and headache. The most common serious AE in the risdiplam arm was pneumonia in 9 patients. There was a trend for more grade 3 to 4 AEs in the risdiplam group. Additional studies of risdiplam are ongoing ( Ev rysdi AMCP Dossier 2020). JEWELFISH is a Phase 2, open- label, exploratory study investigating the safety, pharmacokinetics , and pharmacodynamics of risdiplam in 174 patients 6Data as of September 22, 2020 RLP/AKS Page 35 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx .

RAINBOWFISH, which is currently enrolling patients, is a Phase 2, open- label study evaluating the use of risdiplam in pre- symptomatic SMA patients up to 6 weeks of age at the time of treatment initiation. Othe r studies A recent observational cohort study showed benefit of nusinersen for adults aged 16 to 65 years with SMA . A clinically meaningful improvement (defined as an increase of 3 points or more in the HFMSE score compared to baseline) wasobserved with nusinersen treatment at 6 months in 35 of 124 patients ( 28%) , at 10 months in 33 of 92 patients ( 36%) , and at 14 months in 23 of patients ( 40%) ( Hagenacker 2020). A Coc hrane review of 2 randomized controlled trials assessed the safety and efficacy of drug therapies (nusinersen and riluzole) designed to slow or stop the progression of SMA type 1. Riluzole is not indicated for the treatment of SMA.Authors concluded that intrathecal nusinersen probably prolongs ventilation free and overall survival in infants with SMA type 1. Additionally, a greater proportion of infants treated with nusinersen achieved motor milestones. In the riluzole trial, 3 of 7 children treated with riluzole were still alive at the ages of 30, 48, and 64 months, whereas all 3 children in the placebo group died. None of the children in the riluzole or placebo group developed the ability to sit, which was theonly milestone reported in the study (Wadman et al 2019). A Cochrane review of 14 randomized controlled trial s evaluated the efficacy of various drug treatment s, most of which are not indicated for the treatment of SMA, to slow the disease progression of SMA types 2 and 3. The trials evaluated gabapentin, hydroxyurea, nusinersen, olesoxime, valproic acid/acetyl-L- cartinine. Treatment varied from 3 to 24 months. Overally, no treatment showed a clinically important effect on motor function in SMA types 2 or 3, except for intrathecal nusinersen, which showed a 3.7- point improvement in motor function in children with SMA type 2 based on the HFMSE scale with moderate quality evidence ( Wadman et al 2020). CLINICAL GUIDELINES SMA Newborn Screening Working Group. Treatment algorithm for infants diagnosed with SMA through newborn screening ( Glascock et al 2018) Clinical and preclinical data indicate that early treatment will be critical in order to modulate the rapid, progressivedegeneration seen in SMA, particularly SMA type 1. Animal studies also show that the best results occur when drugsare given as early as possible. Recommendations for the use of SMN -upregulating treatment for patients with a confirmed positive result for SMA on newborn screening are based on the number of SMN2 copies, as follows: 1 SMN2 copy: probable SMA type 0. Treatment is recommended if the patient is truly pre- symptomatic. If symptoms are present, physician discretion is recommended. (Most patients with 1 copy of SMN2 will be symptomat ic at birth.) 2 SMN2 copies: probable SMA type 1. Treatment is recommended. 3 SMN2 copies: probable SMA type 2 or type 3. Treatment is recommended. 4 SMN2 copies: probable SMA type 3 or type 4. Waiting to treat is recommended; patients should be monitored and treated upon the onset of symptoms. (The committee was divided on this recommendation.) In patients with 4 copies of SMN2, who are not immediately treated with a disease- modifying therapy for SMA, the following key recommendations are made: Infants identified as having 4 SMN2 copies should be referred to someone who can identify their exact copy number (some commercial laboratories report the result only as \" 4\"). Routine follow -up care should ideally occur every 3 to 6 months until the patient reaches 2 years of age, and every 6 to 12 months thereafter. This would ensure the detection of very rare cases in which children with 4 SMN2 copies have SMA type 1 or 2. Certain follow -up assessments recommended include electromyography (EMG), compound muscle action potential (CMAP), myometry, physical examinations, and motor function scales. The working group acknowledges that the future availability of new FDA -approved therapies will prompt the need for additional consideration by physicians and patients, as each drug will present unique benefits, risks, and burdens.Data as of September 22, 2020 RLP/AKS Page 36 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx .

Part 1: recommendations for diagnosis, rehabilitation, orthopedic, and nutritional care ( Mercuri et al 2018[a]) and Part 2: pulmonary and acute care; medications, supplements, and immunizations; other organ systems; and ethics ( Finkel et al 2018). The following recommendations outline aspects associated with supportive pharmacological care: Over the last decade, the approach to treating the pulmonary manifestations of SMA has become more proactive, with introduction of therapies earlier in the disease process. Respiratory support should be the highest priority. Management may include airway clearance, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, and tracheotomy ventilation in select patients. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) should not be used routinely. Eur opean ad -hoc consensus statement on gene replacement therapy for spinal muscular atrophy (Kirschner et al 2020) . With the recent approval of Zolgensma , many patients could be eligible for the gene therapy with the broadly defined approved indication. However, clinical trials studied very specific patient groups for gene therapy (eg, SMA type, age and weight), thus individual treatment decisions should be made on a case- by-case basis. The statement of 11 points highlights 3 areas including selection criteria, structural requirements for administration , and generation of additional evidence. Key points are as follows: Selection criteria: Traditional SMA types (0 to 4) alone are not enough to define patients who would most benefit from gene therapy. Age at onset, disease duration, and motor function status are key factors that predict response to treatment insymptomatic patients, whereas treatment decisions for presymptomatic patients should primarily be based on SMN2 copy number. A lthough the approv al of Zolgensma is based on clinical trials in patients 6 months old weighing less than 8.4 kg, it is indicated in patients up to 2 years old. However , little is known about the safety and efficacy in older and heavier patients; in these cases nusinersen is available as a treatment option. When administered after the age of 6 months and/or in advanced stages of the disease, caregivers should be made aware that there are no published data on efficacy and safety. It is important for physicians to discuss the benefit/risk ratio and to carefully manage parents' or patients' expectations . In patients presenting with severe symptomatic disease, there is a high risk of living with severe disability despite the use of gene therapy. Palliative care is recommended as an alternative treatment option in these patients. There is no evidence that combination therapy (eg, Zolgensma plus nusinersen) is superior to any single treatment alone. Before more evidence is available, combination of both approved therapies should not be part of routine care. Structural requirements for administration: P roviders performing gene therapy should have broad expertise in the assessment and treatment of SMA according to international standards. The ideal time between diagnosis andinitiation of a disease modifying treatment should be no longer than 14 days. This is particularly important in infantsdue to the progressive nature of the disease. Generation of additional evidence: Data regarding safety and effectiveness should be collected for all treated patients. Institutions using Zolgensma should be adequately equipped with resources to safely administer the therapy and provide care and long- term monitoring. The statement suggests that patients weighing 13.5 kg may be best treated with Zolgensma in a clinical trial setting only.

CONCLUSION SMA is a serious neuromuscular disease characterized by degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brainstem. Clinical features include progressive muscular atrophy and weakness. SMA is caused by an inherited genetic mutation affecting the SMN1 gene, causing a deficiency of the critical SMN protein. Several subtypes of SMA exist, with varying severity and ages of onset.Data as of September 22, 2020 RLP/AKS Page 38 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx .

Zolgensma has the potential to significantly improve the disease course of SMA with a 1- time IV dose. Published efficacy data are limited to approximately 15 patients, all of whom had SMA type 1 and 2 copies of a modifying gene, SMN2 . Zolgensma is a gene therapy that uses a viral vector to deliver a copy of the gene encoding the human SMN protein. The main safety risks include elevated transaminases and potential acute serious liver injury. Nusinersen has demonstrated efficacy in patients with SMA types 1, 2, and 3 and in pre- symptomatic patients; however, nusinersen requires intrathecal dosing several times per year throughout the patient's lifetime. In pivotal trials, risdiplam improved motor function in people living with SMA over a large range of ages and levels of disease severity including t ypes 1, 2, and 3. Risdiplam helped infants survive longer without the need for permanent ventilatio n and sit without support for 5 seconds , a key motor milestone not normally seen in the natural course of the disease. Risdiplam is an oral medication that is administered by the patient/caregiver, compared to intrathecal (nusinersen) and IV ( Zolgensma) which require a healthcare professional. The specific place in therapy for each SMA agent, including the potential role for sequential treatment, requires further study. APPENDIX Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler development Third Edition (BSID- III) (Evrydsi dossier 2020) BSID -III is intended for children age 1 to 42 months. The assessment is completed over 30 to 90 minutes and measures 5 developmental domains: adaptive behavior, cognition, language, motor, and social -emotional. Raw scores of each successfully completed item are converted to subtest scaled scores and to a composite standard score. The scores determine the child's performance compared with typically developing children of their age. While itis not a disease- specific measure, the BSID -III has high reliability and validity . Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale - Expanded (HFMSE) ( Spinraza dossier 2016) Expanded version of the original 20- item Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale that incorporates 13 items from the Gross Motor Function Measure assessment. Consists of 33 items evaluating the child's ability to perform activities. Each item is scored on a 3- point scale, with a score of 2 for \"performs without modification,\" 1 for \"performs with modification/adaptation,\" and 0 for \"unable toperform.\" The total score can range from 0 (all activities failed) to 66 (all activities achieved). A clinically meaningful change has been estimated to be a 3- point change at 6 months. Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE) ( De Sanctis 2016, Spinraza dossier 2016, FDA Medical Review 2016, Together in SMA 2016) Measures functional ability and achievement of motor milestones. Contains 26 items; total possible score is 78. Healthy -term infants should have a median score 67 at 3 months and 70 at 6 months. At 9 or 12 months, scores 73 are regarded as optimal. Section 1 is based on the neurological exam (postures, cranial nerve function, reflexes, tone, and movements) . Section 2 (HINE -2) evaluates development of motor function based on 8 items (head control, sitting, voluntary grasp, ability to kick in supine, rolling, crawling, standing, and walking); each item is scored between 0 and 2 to 4,for a maximum score of 26. Section 3 evaluates the state of behavior (consciousness, social orientation, and emotional state). Motor Function Measure 32 (MFM -32) (Evrydsi dossier 20 20) MFM- 32 is typically used in people older than 6 years ; however it has been validated in children as young as 2 years old. The assessment typically takes around 30 to 40 minutes to complete. Each item of the MFM is scored using a 4- point Likert scale, ranging from 0 to 3, based on the subject's maximal abilities without assistance. The score s on each of the 32 items are summed and converted to a 0 to 100 total score; the lower the total score, the more severe the impairment. Upper Limb Module (ULM) ( Spinraza dossier 2016) Designed to assess upper limb functional abilities in patients with SMA, including young children and patients withsevere contractures in the lower limbs. Consists of 9 upper limb performance items that reflect activities of daily livi ng. The total score ranges from 0 to 18 points, with higher scores indicating greater functional abilities. An increase of 2 points is considered clinically meaningful.Data as of September 22, 2020 RLP/AKS Page 39 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx .

Clinicians should refer t o the full prescribing i nformati on and publ ished resources when making Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common fatal genetic disease, affecting approximately 30 ,000 patients in the United States (U.S.) ( National Institutes of Health 2013). It is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR ) gene, which encodes for the CFTR protein. This protein acts as an ion channel regulating salt and fluid homeostasis, and defects are associated with thickened secretions, obstruction, and damage to several organs ( Ong et al 2016). Respiratory manifestations are a significant feature of the disease, and respiratory failure is the most common cause of death in patients who do not receive a lung transplant ( Elborn 2016). CF is an autosomal recessive disorder; 2 copies of an abnormal gene must be present for the disease to develop (Elborn 2016). Patients may have 2 copies of the same mutation (homozygous) or 2 different mutations (heterozygous) ( Ong et al 2016). Approximately 2000 mutations have been identified in the CFTR gene, of which more than 300 have been confirmed to cause CF ( CFTR2 2019, Quon and Rowe 2016). In general, these mutations either reduce the amount of CFTR protein that reaches the cell membrane surface or reduce the function of CFTR as a chloride channel ( Egan 2016). The most common CFTR mutation leading to CF is the F508del mutation; approximately 50% of patients with CF are homozygous for this mutation, and 90% carry at least 1 copy ( Katkin 2019 ). Treatment of CF has traditionally been limited to addressing disease manifestations in specific organs ( Quon and Rowe 2016). Inhaled antibiotics have commonly been used to treat persistent airway infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which contributes to lung damage in patients with CF . A reduction of bacterial load in the lungs decreases inflammation and the deterioration of lung function ( Smith et al 2018). Inhaled dornase alfa, hypertonic saline, and mannitol have been used to enhance airway mucociliary clearance, andoral macrolide antibiotics and high- dose ibuprofen have been used to reduce inflammation ( Quon and Rowe 2016). Pulmozyme (dornase alfa), initially approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1993, is a recombinant DNase enzyme. In CF patients, retention of viscous purulent secretions in the airways contributes to reduced pulmonary function and to exacerbations of infection. Dornase alfa hydrolyzes deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in the sputum of CF patients, reducing sputum viscoelasticity. Guidelines recommend the use of dornase alfa for patients with CF aged 6 years with moderate- to-severe lung disease (to improve lung function and quality of life and to reduce exacerbations) and with asymptomatic or mild lung disease (to improve lung function and reduceexacerbations) ( Drugs@FDA 20 20, Mogayzel et al 2013 ). More recently, CFTR modulators have been made available that act on the basic defect(s) in facilitate processing and trafficking (CFTR correctors [tezacaftor and elexacaftor ]) transport at the cell surface (CFTR potentiator [ivacaftor]). Eligibility for CFTR modulator therapy depends on the patient's age and CF -causing mutation(s). In 2018, prior to the approval of Trikafta and some age expansions for the other CFTR modulators, it was estimated that only 55% of p atients with a known genotype were eligible for CFTR modulator therapy ( Vertex CF portfolio guide 2018). The approval of Trikafta may provide the opportunity for up to 90% of CF patients to be eligible for CFTR modulator therapy in the future ( Vertex 2019). The CFTR modulators are used in conjunction with traditional therapies in patients who are eligible. This review includes the 4 available CFTR modulators and dornase alfa.

CLINICAL EFFICACY SU MMARY CFTR Modulators Note: The following is a brief overview of the clinical evidence supporting the efficacy of the CFTR modulators. Appendix A provides an overview of key clinical trials for CFTR modulators in a table format. Appendix B provides a description of study endpoints. The s afety and efficacy of ivacaftor have been evaluated in a number of trials in patients with a variety of CFTR mutations. In addition to the clinical evidence available, ivacaftor has been FDA -approved for the treatment of some CFTR mutations based on in vitro assay data. A 48-w eek, double- blind trial demonstrated improvement in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV 1) and exacerbations for ivacaftor vs placebo in 167 patients with CF aged 12 years with 1 G551D mutation ( Ramsey et al 2011). A separate, placebo- controlled, 48-week double- blind trial in 52 patients aged 6 to 11 years with this mutation demonstrated improvement in ppFEV 1 (Davies et al 2013 ), and an open- label extension study of these 2 trials demonstrated sustained ppFEV 1 improvement over 96 weeks ( McKone et al 2014). A placebo- controlled crossover trial with two 8- week treatment periods demonstrated improved pp FEV 1 with ivacaftor in 39 patients with CF aged 6 years with a non- G551D gating mutation ( De 24-week, double- blind , placebo- controlled trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of ivacaftor vs placebo in 69 patients aged 6 years with an R117H mutation ( Moss et al 2015). In this trial, improvement in ppFEV 1 was demonstrated in adults but not in children aged 6 to 11 years; the authors suggested that the lack of effect may havebeen related to the high baseline ppFEV 1 in the pediatric patients enrolled. A crossover study with two 8- week treatment arms enrolled a total of 246 patients aged 12 years with CF who were heterozygous for F508del and a residual function mutation ( Rowe et al 2017). A comparison of the ivacaftor and placebo arms demonstrated an improvement in ppFEV 1 with ivacaftor. ( See the tezacaftor/ivacaftor section below for information on comparisons of tezacaftor/ivacaftor to ivacaftor and placebo in this study .) An open- label study in 34 patients aged 2 to 5 years with CF and 1 CFTR gating mutation evaluated weight -based dosing of ivacaftor in this age group ( Davies et al 2016). Patients weighing < 14 kg received a dose of 50 mg and those 14 kg received a dose of 75 mg. Pharmacokinetic analyses demonstrated that exposure was similar to t hat reported with the approved dosing in adults. Improvements were also seen in weight and sweat chloride concentrations (a pharmacodynamic endpoint that reflects changes in CFTR function). No meaningful data on lung function w ere available, as the accuracy of spirometry results is limited in this age group. The efficacy of ivacaftor in patients aged 6 to < 24 months was extrapolate d from data in patients aged 6 years with support from pharmacokinetic analyses showing similar drug exposure levels to adults. Safety of ivacaftor in this age group was derived from a cohort of 11 patients aged 6 months to < 12 months and a cohort of 19 patients aged 12 months to < 24 months in a 24- week, open- label stud y, which demonstrated that the safety profile was similar in this age group to that observed in patients aged 24 months . The study also demonstrated improvements in sweat chloride and markers of pancreatic function in patients aged 12 months to < 24 months (Kalydeco prescribing information 2018, Rosenfeld et al 2018). A systematic review and meta- analysis evaluated the use of ivacaftor vs placebo in patients with CF ( Skilton et al 2019). The review included 5 trials evaluating ivacaftor in patients with the F508del mutation (1 trial, N = 140), the G551D mutation (3 trials, N = 238), or the R117H mutation (1 trial, N = 69). Primary outcomes included survival, quality of life as assessed by the CF questionnaire- revised (CFQ -R), and FEV 1. Over all, the authors found evidence supporting the efficacy of ivacaftor in patients with the G551D mutation, but not the F508del or R117H mutations. Key findings from the review were as follows: No survival data or deaths were reported in any of the included trials. In studies of patients with the F508del mutation, no improvement was demonstrated in CFQ -R or FEV 1. In studies of patients with the G551D mutation, improvement was demonstrated in both CFQ -R and FEV 1, although improvements in CFQ -R were not statistically significant at all time points. In studies of patients with the R117H mutation, improvement was demonstrated in CFQ -R (in adults but not children) , and there was no improvement in FEV 1. Support for ivacaftor's efficacy for additional mutations is available from in vitro assay data ( Kalydeco prescribing information 201 8). This assay was based on CFTR chloride transport in Fisher Rat Thyroid cells expressing mutantData as of January 6, 2020 AKS/AL S Page 44 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx .

An increase in chloride transport of 10% was designated as the response threshold because it is predictive or reasonably expected to predict clinical benefit. Mutations meeting this threshold were considered responsive, and a patient must have at least 1 responsive mutation in order for ivacaftor to be indicated. A number of trials have evaluated the safety and efficacy of lumacaftor/ivacaftor for the treatment of patients with CF homozygous for the F508del mutation. Two 24- week, double- blind, placebo- controlled trials evaluated the efficacy of lumacaftor/ivacaftor in a total of 1122 patients with CF aged 12 years who were homozygous for the F508del mutation (Wain wright et al 2015). Pooled data demonstrated an improvement in ppFEV 1 as well as exacerbations. Based on a 96- week open- label extension study, the ppFEV 1 remained above pre- treatment baseline in patients continuing lumacaftor/ivacaftor; however, the improvement was not statistically significant ( Konstan et al 2017). A 24-week, open- label study evaluated the use of lumacaftor/ivacaftor in 46 patients with CF aged 12 years who were homozygous for the F508del mutation and had severe lung disease (ppFEV 1 < 40) (Taylor -Cousar et al 2018). Dose modification to half the us ual dose for 1 to 2 weeks at treatment initiation was permitted; 28 patients initiated treatment at full dose (400 mg/250 mg twice daily) and 18 patients initiated at half dose (200 mg/125 mg twice daily). The primary endpoints were safety and tolerability, which demonstrated that the most common adverse events ( AEs) were respiratory in nature; patients initiating treatment at the reduced dose had less frequent respiratory events. Following an initial reduction, ppFEV 1 from week 4 to the end of the study was similar to baseline. A 24-week, open- label study evaluated the use of lumacaftor/ivacaftor in 58 patients with CF aged 6 to 11 years who were homozygous for F508del ( Milla et al 2017). At 24 weeks, there was a small improvement in ppFEV 1 that failed to reach statistical significance (p = 0.0671); the authors suggest ed that the lack of a significant effect might have been due to the sma ll sample size and relatively mild lung disease in this population. A separate double- blind, placebo- controlled trial in 206 patients in this age group demonstrated a small but statistically significant effect on ppFEV 1 (Rat jen et al 2017). An open- label, Phase 3 study evaluated the use of lumacaftor/ivacaftor in patients with CF aged 2 to 5 years who were homozygous for F508del ( McNamara et al 2019). Patients weighing between 8 and 14 kg received a dose of 100 mg/125 mg and patients weighing 14 kg received a dose of 150 mg/188 mg, each given twice daily. A total of 12 patients were enrolled in part A of the study (assessing pharmacokinetics and safety over 15 days) and 60 were enrolled in part B (assessing pharmacokinetics, safety, pharmacodynamics, and e fficacy over 24 weeks ). The study demonstrated a reduction in mean sweat chloride concentrations, improvement in biomarkers of pancreatic function,and increased growth parameters. Safety and pharmacokinetics were consistent with previous studies oflumacaftor/ivacaftor. Two published Phase 3 trials have evaluated the safety and efficacy of tezacaftor/ivacaftor in patients with CF aged 12 years , and efficacy has been extrapolated to patients aged 6 to < 12 years . As with ivacaftor, tezacaftor/ivacaftor has additionally been FDA approved for the treatment of some CFTR mutations based on in vitro assay data. A 24-week, double- blind trial compared tezacaftor/ivacaftor to placebo in 509 patients with CF aged 12 years who were homozygous for the F508del mutation ( Taylor -Cousar et al 2017). The improvement in ppFEV 1 was greater with tezacaftor/ivacaftor vs placebo, and the rate of pulmonary exacerbations also favored tezacaftor/ivacaftor treatment. A double- blind, crossover trial with two 8- week treatment periods evaluated tezacaftor/ivacaftor, ivacaftor monotherapy, and placebo in 246 patients with CF aged 12 years who were heterozygous for F508del and a second allele with a residual function mutation ( Rowe et al 2017). Both tezacaf tor/ivacaftor and improved ppFEV 1 vs placebo, with tezacaftor /ivacaftor having a slightly larger effect than ivacaftor alone. The efficacy of tezacaftor/ivacaftor in patients aged 6 to < 12 years was extrapolated from patients aged 12 years with support from population pharmacokinetic analyses showing similar tezacaftor and ivacaftor exposure levels in patients aged 6 to < 12 years to older patients. Safety of tezacaftor/ivacaftor in this population was derived from a 24- week, open- label trial in 70 patients aged 6 to < 12 years ( Symdeko prescribing information 2019). Two published Phase 3 trials have evaluated the safety and efficacy of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor in patient s with CF. A 24-week, randomized, double- blind trial compared elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor vs placebo in 403 patients 12 years of age with a single F508del mutation and a minimal function mutation (ie, a mutation that is nonresponsive to ivacaftor and tezacaftor/ivacaftor) (Middleton et al 2019). The primary endpoint, the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 at week 4, was significantly greater in the elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor group vs placebo, with a difference of 13.8 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], 12.1 to 15.4; p < 0.001). Differences also favored elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor in the change from baseline in ppFEV 1 through week 24, number of pulmonaryData as of January 6, 2020 AKS/AL S Page 45 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx .

A 4-week, randomized, double- blind trial compared elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor to tezacaftor/ivacaftor in 107 patients 12 years of age who were homozygous for the F508del mutation ( Heijerman et al 2019). All patients received tezacaftor/ivacaftor in a 4- week run- in period that preceded the 4- week intervention period, and baseline measurements for the intervention period reflected measurements taken after the tezacaftor/ivacaftor run-in period. The primary endpoint, the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 at week 4, was significantly greater in the elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor group vs the tezacaftor/ivacaftor group, with a difference of 10.0 percentage points (95% CI, 7.4 to 12.6). Differences also favored elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor in sweat chloride concentration and CFQ -R respiratory domain score. A systematic review and meta- analysis evaluated the use of CFTR correctors , alone or in combination with ivacaft or, vs placebo in patients with CF and class II mutations (predominantly patients homozygous for the F508del mutation) (Southern et al 2018). The authors found insufficient evidence that monotherapy with a CFTR corrector has any clinically important effects in patients homozygous for F508del . Lumacaftor/ivacaftor and tezacaftor/ivacaftor each resulted in similar, small improvements in clinical outcomes, including quality of life, respiratory function, and pulmonary exacerbations. With respect to tolerability, lumacaftor/ivacaftor was associated with an increase in early, transientshortness of breath and longer -term increases in blood pressure, neith er of which was observed with tezacaftor/ ivacaftor. The author s concluded that tezacaftor/ivacaftor has a better safety profile compared to lumacaftor /ivacaftor ; however, the 2 combinations have not been directly compared. An additional systematic review and meta- analysis evaluated the use of CFTR modulators in patients with various genetic mutations ( Habib et al 2019). A total of 14 trials (8 Phase 3 and 6 Phase 2) were included in the review; the elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor triple therapy was not included. The authors found that the largest improvement in ppFEV 1 vs placebo was demonstrated in patients with the G551D mutation treated with ivacaftor, with a weighted absolute mean difference of 10.8% (95% CI, 9.0 to 12.7). Patients with this mutation treated with ivacaftor also had the greatest reduction in pulmonary exacerbati ons. Patients aged 12 years who were homozygous for the F508del mutation had smaller improvement s vs placebo when treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor or tezacaftor/ivacaftor . Improvements with each of these combination products were similar: 3. 4% (95% CI, 2.4 to 4.4) with lumacaftor/ivacaftor and 4.0% (95% CI, 3. 2 to 4.8) with tezacaftor/ ivacaftor . Lumacaftor/ivacaftor and tezacaftor/ivacaftor also significantly reduced the risk of exacerbations vs placebo in patients with this genotype, but the risk reduction was less than that observed with ivacaftor in patients with the G551D mutation. Patients treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor had more respiratory -related AEs leading to treatment discontinuation vs placebo. Dornase alfa Pivotal trials have been conducted in CF patients with an FVC > 40% predicted and in patients with advanced lung disease ( FVC < 40% predicted) ( Fuchs et al et al 1996). A 24-week, randomized, double- bl ind, placebo -controlled trial was conducted in 968 adults and children aged 5 years with clinically stable CF and FVC > 40% predicted ( Fuchs et al 1994). Patients received dornase alfa 2.5 mcg once daily, dornase alfa 2.5 mcg twice daily, or placebo. A T -Updraft II Nebu-u- mist nebulizer with Pul moAide compressor was used for drug administration. The administration of dornase alfa once or twice daily reduced the risk of an exacerbation requiring parenteral antibiotic treatment, although only the reduction with twice- daily dosing was statistically significant. Exacerbations requiring parenteral antibiotic therapy occurred in 27%, 22%, and 19% of patients in the placebo, once- daily, and twice -daily groups, respectively. The relative risk vs placebo was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.57 to 1.06; p = 0.11) in onc e- daily dornase alfa group and 0.66 (95% CI, 0.48 to 0.91; p = 0.01) in the twice- daily group. When adjusted based on the estimated relative risk of exacerbation by patient age, the exacerbation reduction was statistically significantwith both dose regimens (once daily: relative risk, 0.72; CI, 0.46 to 0.87; p < 0.01). Dornase alfa also improved pulmonary function. FEV 1 improved an average of 5.8% and 5.6% with once- and twice -daily dos ing, respectively , throughout the study, while placebo- treated patients did not improve (change of 0.0%) (p < 0.01 for both dose regimens vs placebo). Dornase alfa also improved quality of life compared to placebo.Data as of January 6, 2020 AKS/AL S Page 46 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx .

A 12-week, randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled trial was conducted in 320 patients (age range, 7 to 57 years) with clinically stable CF and FVC < 40% predicted ( McCoy et al 1996). Patients received dornase alfa 2.5 mg once daily or placebo. There were no statistically significant differences in the incidence of pulmonary exacerbations; the age- adjusted relative risk for patients treated with dornase alfa vs placebo was 0.925 (95% CI, 0.69 to 1.21; p = 0.52). However, the study may have been underpowered to detect a difference. Dornase alfa significantly improved pulmonary function. The mean improvements in FEV 1 were 9.4% and 2.1% in the dornase alfa and placebo groups, respectively (p < 0.001), and the mean improvements in FVC were 12.4% and 7.3%, respectively (p < 0.01). No differences were observed in dyspnea scores. A 2-year, randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled trial was conducted in 474 children aged 6 to 10 years with CF and mild lung function abnormalities (FVC 85% predicted) ( Quan et al 2001). Patients received dornase alfa 2.5 mg daily or placebo with a jet nebulizer and compressor. After 2 years of therapy, patients treated with dornase alfa maintained their ppFEV 1 (mean change from baseline, 0.04% predicted), whereas patients treated with placebo had a decrease from baseline of 3.2% predicted (p = 0.00 6). Lung function benefit was also shown for the forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of p = 0.0008) and maximal expiratory flow rate at 50% of vital capacity (difference, 8.2% predicted; p = 0.0002); however, the treatment difference in FVC was not statistically significant (difference, 0.7% predicted; p = 0.51). Use of dornase alfa also reduced pulmonary exacerbations. In the dornase alfa group, 40 patients (17%) had a total of 62 exacerbations, compared to 56 patients (24%) and 92 exacerbations in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.44 to 1.00; p = 0.048). A randomized crossover study in 87 patients with CF aged 6 years c ompared administration of dornase alfa via a jet nebulizer to administration using the Pari eRapid electronic nebulizer ( Sawicki et al 2015). The 2 devices led to comparable efficacy and safety, while the eRapid nebulizer was associated with shorter administration times and higher patient preference. A systematic review and meta- analysis evaluated the use of dornase alfa in patients with CF (Yang and Montgomery 2018 ). The review included randomized and quasi -randomized controlled trials comparing dornase alfa to placebo, standard therapy, or other medications that improve airway clearance. In all, 19 trials ( N = 2565) w ere included, most of which compared dornase alfa to placebo. Trial duration ranged from 6 days to 3 years. Of the 19 trials included in the qualitative synthesis, 13 trials were included in the meta- analysis. Compared to placebo or no dornase alfa treatment, dornase alfa was demonstrated to improve FEV 1 at various time points ranging from 1 month to 2 years. Results for efficacy at 1 month of treatment were pooled from 4 trials and demonstrated a mean improvement vs placebo of 9.51% (95% CI, 0.67 to 18.35). Results for later time points werebased on a smaller number of trials and generally showed smaller improvements. Pooled data for pulmonary exacerbations from 3 trials found a significant exacerbation reduction, with a risk ratio of 0.78 (95% CI, 0.62 to 0.96). Effects on quality -of-life measurements such as symptoms, activity limitation, fatigue, and emotional well -being varied among trials, with some (but not all) showing significant benefits . Based on 7 trials, mortality was not significantly different between dornase alfa and control groups (risk ratio, 1.7; 95% CI, 0.70 to 4.14). The majority of deaths were reported from trials in patients with severe lung disease. Overall, voice alteration and rash were the only AEs associated with dornase alfa. Evidence comparing dornase alfa to other medications was limited. CLINICAL GUIDELINES Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF).

Clinical Decision Support Resource: UptoDate Topic Review CF: Treatment with CFTR modulators ( Simon 2019) The use of a CFTR modulator is recommended for most individuals with CF who are 12 years old and have responsive CFTR variants, and suggested for most younger patients with CF for whom sufficient evidence is available to allow FDA approval. Selection of a specific CFTR modulator depends on the patient's genotype and age. Table 6 provides an overview of recommendations for the use of CFTR modulators. Gating and residual function mutations are listed in the boxes below the table. These recommendations reflect the indications for each CFTR modulator as of October 2019 and consideration of each drug's efficacy, AEs, and potential for drug- drug interactions. Many of the recommendations were based upon comparisons of efficacy and safety data from clinical trials in which each treatment was studied independently rather than by direct comparison of multiple treatments within a single study. These recommendations are likely to change as new evidence becomes available. Table 6. Recommendations for CFTR modulator therapy in patients with 2 to 5 yrs 6 to 11 yrs 12 yrs F508del heterozygote without a gating or residual function mutation < 12 yrs 12 yrs F508del heterozygote with gating mutation at other allele* 6 mos to 11 yrs 12 yrs F508del heterozygote with residual function mutation at other allele* 6 mos to 5 yrs 6 to 11 yrs 12 yrs Gating mutation without F508del 6 mos Residual function mutation without F508del 6 mos to 5 yrs 6 yrs Abbreviations: mos = months; yrs = years *For patients heterozygous for F508del who also have gating or residual function variants, Trikafta is suggested if it is available and the patient is eligible ( 12 years) because the triple combination therapy is likely to be more effective than monotherapy or dual therapy. Gating mutations approved by FDA for in vitro studies showed that ivacaftor increased their CFTR functional activity; these findings led to the FDA approval for ivacaftor.

For patients with a history of transaminase elevations, more frequent monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs) should be considered. Dosage interruptions may be necessary in patients with significant transaminase elevations. Use of Kalydeco with 3A rifampin, substantially decreases the exposure of ivacaftor and is not recommended. See the prescribing information for full details on drug interactions. Non- congenital lens opacities/cataracts have been reported in pediatric patients. Although other risk factors were present in some cases, a possible risk attributable to ivacaftor cannot be excluded. Baseline and follow -up ophthalmological examinations are recommended in pediatric patients initiating Kalydeco treatment. The most common adverse reactions ( 8% in patients with CF who have a G551D mutation) were headache, oropharyngeal pain, upper respiratory tract infection, nasal congestion, abdominal pain, nasopharyngitis, diarrhea, rash, nausea, and dizziness. Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor): Contraindications: none Warnings/precautions: Worsening of liver function, including hepatic encephalopathy , in patients with advanced liver disease has been reported. Orkambi should be used with caution in patients with advanced liver disease and only if the benefits areexpected to outweigh the risks. If Orkambi is used in these patients, the patients should be closely monitored and the dose should be reduced. Serious adverse reactions related to elevated transaminases have been reported; in some cases associated with concomitant elevations in total serum bilirubin. ALT, AST, and bilirubin should be assessed prior to initiating Orkambi, every 3 months during the first year of treatment, and annually thereafter. For patients with a history of ALT, AST, or bilirubin elevations, more frequent monitoring should be considered. Dosage interruptions may be necessary in patients with significant transaminase or bilirubin elevations. Respiratory events (eg, chest discomfort, dyspnea, and abnormal respiration) were observed more commonly in patients during initiation of O rkambi compared to those who received placebo. These events have led to drug discontinuation and can be serious, particularly in patients with advanced lung disease (ppFEV 1 < 40). Clinical experience in patients with ppFEV 1 < 40 is limited, and additional monitoring of these patients is recom mended during initiation of therapy . Increased blood pressure has been observed in some patients treated with Orkambi. Blood pressure should be monitored periodically. Drug interactions: Lumacaftor is a strong inducer of CYP3A. Administration of Orkambi may decrease systemic exposure of CYP3A substrates. Co- administration with sensitive CYP3A substrates or CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index is not recommended. Orkambi may substantially decrease hormonal contraceptive exposure, reducing their effectiveness and increasing the incidence of menstruation- associated adverse reactions, eg, amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, and irregular menstruation (27% in women using hormonal contraceptives compared with 3% inwomen not using hormonal contraceptives). Hormonal contraceptives, including oral, injectable, transdermal,and implantable, should not be relied upon as an effective method of contraception when co- administered with Orkambi. Ivacaftor is a substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 isoenzymes. of Orkambi with strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, significantly reduces ivacaftor exposure and is not recommended.

The most common adverse reactions ( 5% in patients with CF who are homozygous for the F508del mutation) were dyspnea, nasopharyngitis, nausea, diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, abnormal respiration, increased blood creatine phosphokinase, Warnings/precautions: Elevated transaminases have been observed in patients treated with Symdeko. Assessments of ALT and AST are recommended for all patients prior to initiating Symdeko, every 3 months during the first year of treatment, and annually thereafter. For patients with a history of transaminase elevations, more frequent monitoring should beconsidered. Dosage interruptions may be necessary in patients with significant transaminase elevations . Use of Symdeko with strong CYP3A inducers significantly decreases exposure to ivacaftor and may decrease exposure to tezacaftor; c o-administration is not recommended.

Although other risk factors were present in some cases, a possible risk attributable to treatment with Symdeko cannot beexcluded. Baseline and follow -up ophthalmological examinations are recommended in pediatric patients initiating treatment with Symdeko. The most common adverse reactions ( 3% of patients) were headache, nausea, sinus congestion, and Trikafta ( elexacaftor /tezacaftor/ivacaftor): Contraindications: none Warnings/precautions: Elevated observed in patients treated with Trikafta. Bilirubin elevations have also been observed. Assessments of ALT , AST, and bilirubin are recommended for all patients prior to initiating Trikafta , every 3 months during the first year of treatment, and annually thereafter. More frequent monitoring should be considered in patients with a history of hepatobiliary disease or LFT elevations. Dosage interruptions may be necessary in patients with significant transaminase elevations. Use of Symdeko with strong CYP3A inducers significantly decreases exposure to ivacaftor and would be expected decrease exposure to tezacaftor and elexacaftor ; co-administration is not recommended.

See the current prescribing information for full used in the long- term management of CF in patients eligible for such treatment based on their age and specific CFTR mutations. These products act to facilitate processing and trafficking of CFTR to the cell surface or to increase chloride transport at the cell surface. These products have been demonstrated to improve lung function; some trials also demonstrated improvement in reducing pulmonary exacerbations and/or improving qualityof life. The approval of Trikafta expand ed the population of patients eligible for highly effective CFTR modulator therapy . As a result of the Trikafta approval and expanded indications for existing agents, the majority of patients with CF have become eligible for CFTR modulator therapy . Key warnings/precautions with the CFTR modulators include the risk of elevated transaminases, cataracts, and drug interactions. A key additional warning for Orkambi is the risk of respiratory events (eg, chest discomfort, dyspnea, andData as of January 6, 2020 AKS/AL S Page 53 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx .

Orkambi has also been associated with worsening of liver function in patients with advanced liver disease, and has more significant drug interactions than the other CFTR modulators. The CFTR modulators are dosed orally twice daily. Pulmozyme (dornase alfa) is another key treatment used in the long- term management of CF. It works to reduce sputum viscoelasticity . Guidelines recommend its use in patients aged 6 years with moderate- to-severe lung disease (to improve lung function and quality of life and to reduce exacerbations) and with asymptomatic or mild lung disease (to improve lung function and reduce exacerbations). Pulmozyme has no warnings/precautions listed in its prescribing information. Pulmozyme is administered by inhalation with a nebulizer. Recommended dosing is once daily, although some patients may benefit from twice -daily administration. APPENDICES Appendix A: Additional Information on CFTR Modulators Tab le 8.

KONDUCT Moss et al 2015 Phase 3, 24 -week, DB, PC trial in 69 patients aged 6 yrs with R117H mutation ppFEV 1: 24 weeks: 2.6 percentage points from baseline; difference from placebo, 2.1 percentage points (95% CI, - 1.13 to 5.35; p = 0.20); in a pre- specified subgroup analysis, ppFEV 1 significantly improved with ivacaftor in patients aged 18 yrs, with a TD vs placebo of 5.0 percentage points (95% CI, 1.15 to 8.78), but not in patients aged 6 to 11 yrs, with a TD vs placebo of - 6.3 percentage points (95% CI, -11.96 to - 0.71; p = 0.03) Secondary endpoints: Improvements were observed in sweat chloride and CFQ -R. The l ack of effect for ppFEV 1 in the pediatric and overall populations may be related in part to the fact that pediatric patients had a high baseline ppFEV 1. Most patients (N = 65) entered a washout period followed by an OLE period; at a 12- week analysis, patients in both the placebo -to- ivacaftor and ivacaftor -to-ivacaftor groups showed a significant ppFEV 1 improvement from post -washout baseline (5.0 [p = 0.0005] and 6.0 [ p = 0.0006] percentage points, respectively).

Bi omarkers of pancreatic function improved (increased immunoreactive trypsinogen). Mean serum lipase and amylase were elevated at baseline and decreased rapidly with ivacaftor. Gr owth status was generally well maintained. Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT Wa inwright et al 2015 Two Phase 3, 24 -week, DB, PC trials in 1122 patients aged 12 yrs homozygous for F508del ppFEV 1: 24 weeks, pooled data: 2.5 percent age points from baseline; difference from placebo, 2.8 percentage points (95% CI, 1.8 to 3.8; p < 0.001) Secondary endpoints: In the pooled analysis, there were improvements in weight and exacerbations. The difference in CFQ -R did not reach statistical sig nificance, with an improvement of 2.2 (95% CI, 0.0 to 4.5; p = 0.05). PROGRESS Kons tan et al 2017 Phase 3, 96 -week, OLE study of TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT; enrolled 1030 patients aged 12 yrs homozygous for F508del ; all received lumacaftor/ivacaftor Long -term safety (primary endpoint): Most AEs were mild or moderate; r ates of AEs were similar or reduced to rates during the PC period of the trial ; an increase in blood pressure was noted ppFE V1 (secondary endpoint): Mean ppFEV 1 remained above pre-treatment baseline in patients continuing lumacaftor/ivacaftor, but the improvement was not statistically signif icant Additional secondary endpoints: The pulmonary exacerbation rate remained low. Improvements in BMI and CFQ -R continued throughout the study. Ana lysis of lung function change over time showed a slower rate of decline compared to matched registry patients. Taylor -Cousar et al 2018 Phase 3b, 24 -week, OL study in 46 patients aged 12 yrs homozygous for F508del who had advanced lung disease (ppFEV 1 < 40); 28 received lumacaftor/ ivacaftor at the usual dose (400 mg/250 mg twice daily) and 18 patients initiated at half -dose (200 mg/125 mg twice daily) for Safety/tolerability: The most common AEs were respiratory in nature (infective pulmonary exacerbation, abnormal respiration, cough, dyspnea) ; patients initiating on half -dose had less frequent respiratory events (56% vs 71%) and events were of shorter duration (median 4 vs 9 Secondary endpoints: There was an initial decrease in ppFEV 1 that returned to baseline at week 4 and remained near baseline throughout the remainder of the study. Improvements vs baseline were seen in sweat chloride and BMI . Reductions in intravenous antibiotics and all -cause hospitalization were shown between the study period and the 24- week period prior to the study.

Numerical improvements were seen in BMI, CFR- Q, and sweat chloride. The change in BMI was not statistically significant, and the changes in CFQ - R and sweat chloride were not assessed for statistical significance due to the testing hierarchy. The rate of respiratory AEs was not higher in the tezacaftor/ivacaftor group than the placebo group; this compares favorably to s tudies with lumacaftor/ivacaftor. EXPAND Row e et al 2017 Phase 3, DB, PC, XO trial (two 8- week treatment periods) in 246 patients aged 12 yrs heterozygous for F508del and a residual function mutation ppFEV 1: 8 weeks: difference for tezacaftor/ivacaftor vs placebo, 6.8 percentage points (95% CI, 5.7 to 7.8; p < 0.0001); difference for tezacaftor/ivacaftor vs ivaca ftor, 2.1 percentage points (95% CI, 1.2 to 2.9; p < 0.0001) Secondary endpoints: Improvement was seen in CFQ -R for vs the difference in CFQ -R between tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor was not statistically significant. A numerical improvement was observed in sweat chloride, but significance was not assessed due to the statistical hierarchy. Trikafta (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor) VX17 -445-102 Middleton et al 2019 Phase 3, 24 -week, DB, PC trial in 403 patients aged 12 years heterozygous for F508del and a minimal function mutation ppFEV 1: 4 weeks: difference for elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ ivacaftor vs placebo, 13.8 percentage points (95% CI, 12.1 to 15.4; p < 0.001) 24 weeks: difference for elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ ivacaftor vs placebo, 14.3 percentage points (95% CI, 12.7 to 15.8; p < 0.001) Secondary endpoints: Improvements were observed in pulmonary exacerbations, CFQ -R score, sweat chloride, and BMI.

VX17 Heijerman et al 2019 Phase 3, 4 -week, DB, AC trial in 107 patients aged 12 years homozygous for F508del ppFEV 1: 10.0 to 12.6; p < 0.0001) Secondary endpoints: Improvements were seen in CFQ -R score and sweat chloride. Exacerbations were not defined as an efficacy endpoint, but were reported as an AE less frequently in the elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor group than in the tezacaftor/ivacaftor group. BMI was not defined as an efficacy endpoint but increased more in the elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor group (nominal p < 0.0001). Note : CFQ -R scores refer to the respiratory domain. Abbreviations: AC = active -controlled, AE = adverse event, ALT = alanine aminotransferase, AST aspartate aminotransferase, -R questionnaire- revised, CI = confidence interval, DB = double- blind, LCI = lung clearance index, LFT = liver function test, OL = open- label, OLE = open- label extension, PC = placebo- controlled, ppFEV 1 = percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second, TD = treatment difference, ULN = upper limit of normal, XO = crossover, yrs = years Appendix B: Study (CFQ -R) (American Thoracic Society 2002, Quittner et al This is a disease- specific quality -of-life instr ument designed to measure impact of CF on overall health, daily life, perceived well -being, and symptoms. The CFQ -R has 9 quality -of-life domains (physical, role/school, vitality, emotion, social, body image, eating, treatment burden, and health perceptions) and 3 symptom scales (weight, respiratory, and digestion). Scaling of items uses 4- point Likert scales (eg, always/often/sometimes/never). Each health- related quality -of-life domain is scored. Standardized scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life. The minimal clinically important difference in CFQ -R respiratory scores has been estimated to be approximately 8.5 points in patients experiencing a CF exacerbation and 4.0 points in stable CF patients. Lung Clear ance Index (LCI 2.5) (Ratjen et al 2017) This is a measure of the number of lung volume turnovers required to reach 2.5% of tracer gas concentration. Elevated LCI 25 values reflect increasing unevenness of gas mixing within the lung caused by early lung dis ease secondary to mucus plugging and airway wall changes. LCI 2.5 may be more sensitive than FEV 1 for the presence of early structural lung abnormalities, particularly in the pediatric population. Sweat chloride test ( Durmowicz et al 2013, Farrell et al 2017) This test measures the amount of chloride in a patient's sweat. It is considered the gold standard for diagnosis of CF. A sweat test concentration of 60 mmol/L indicates a diagnosis of CF, and a concentration of < 30 mmol/L indicates that CF is unlikely. Patients with results in the intermediate range (30 to 59 mmol/L) and certain clinical characteristics (positive newborn screen, symptoms of CF, or a positive family history) may have CF and further testing should beconsidered. Based on the diagnost ic relationship between sweat chloride and CF, change in sweat chloride has been used as a measure of CFTR function and as a pharmacodynamic endpoint in clinical trials. A reduction in sweat chloride hasbeen demonstrated in clinical trials of CFTR modulators. However, a correlation between changes in sweat chloride and improvements in FEV 1 has not been consistently demonstrated, and there is no specific improvement in sweat chloride concentration that can predict FEV 1 improvement. This may be related to the multiple physiologic, environmental, and genetic factors that modulate CF severity.Data as of January 6, 2020 AKS/AL S Page 59 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.
