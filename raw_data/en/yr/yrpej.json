The Health Assessment and Toxicology (HAT) Program works to understand how exposure to toxic substances can affect our health. Our aim is to prevent and reduce the harmful effects they have on health and quality of life. The HAT Program works to keep people safe from dangerous chemicals by: - Answering questions about the impact of pollution on our health. - Collecting surveillance data on major chemical releases and poisonings. - Investigating sites where people may come into contact with chemicals. - Recommending evidence-based actions to keep people safe. The HAT Program operates under state laws: [Health and Safety Code, Title 6, Chapter 503.005: Health Risk Assessments](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/HS/htm/HS.503.htm#503.005) [Title 2, Subtitle H, Chapter 161.0211, subchapter C: Epidemiology or Toxicology Investigations](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/HS/htm/HS.161.htm#161.0211) External links to other sites are intended to be informational and do not have the endorsement of the Texas Department of State Health Services.
