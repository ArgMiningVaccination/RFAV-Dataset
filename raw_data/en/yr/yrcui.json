An annual tradition since 1970, the conference has provided opportunities for thousands of students to present talks, performances, posters, exhibits, and displays on their research and creative endeavors. WKU has a rich history of scholarly engagement of students. Scholarly activity has been defined as original and creative work that is shared with colleagues and the general public. Research is a form of scholarly activity that involves the discovery of new knowledge. Other forms of scholarship include the development of new technologies, methods, materials or uses; the integration of knowledge that leads to new understanding; and artistry that creates new insights and interpretations.* As demonstrated by the Student Research Conference, students significantly enrich their academic experiences at WKU by engaging in scholarly activity. Between 1970 and 2002, the WKU chapter of Sigma Xi, which is an international research society, organized and funded the WKU Student Research Conference. For the next three years, the conference was jointly sponsored and organized by Sigma Xi and the University Honors Program. In 2006, WKU hosted a weekend-long celebration of student scholarship that included the Potter College Undergraduate Conference on Friday and the annual WKU Student Research Conference on Saturday, the latter again sponsored by Sigma Xi and the University Honors Program. The following year, a special committee comprised of representatives of each college, the University Honors Program, and Sigma Xi organized the conference. In 2006-2007 Sigma Xi and the Office of the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs provided financial support for the conference. In 2008 Provost Barbara Burch created the Student Research Council, a university-wide committee charged with promoting student scholarly activity on campus and organizing the annual student conference. Since that year, the Student Research Council has organized the annual Student Research Conference, with financial support provided by the WKU chapter of Sigma Xi and the Office of the Provost. For more information about student research at WKU, visit http://www.wku.edu/studentresearch. The 41st Annual Student Research Conference is the biggest in the events history. There are 135 paper presentations and performances, as well as 80 poster presentations and exhibits. A total of 149 undergraduate students and 66 graduate students are primary authors this year, and an additional 112 students are co-authors. The undergraduate participants include 61 Honors College and 29 Gatton Academy of Mathematics and Science students. A total of 124 faculty served as mentors, and 33 departments from all colleges are represented among the conference participants. * Weiser, C. J. (1996, March 7).

She earned degrees in drama, education, and English from New York University and University of New Hampshire. Her inter-disciplinary doctoral program at UNH focused on literacy and schooling. A literary educator for over 35 years, Dr. Chiseri-Strater currently teaches courses in creative non-fiction, composition and reading theory, literacy studies, and research methodology. In addition to her duties with the English Department at UNCG, Dr. Chiseri-Strater serves as the Graduate Director of Womens and Gender Studies Program. Dr. Chiseri-Strater continues to research the ways that ethnographic inquiry enhances literacy research. She has published extensively on teaching pedagogy, ethnographic research methods, academic literacies, and related topics. Dr. Chiseri-Straters presentation is entitled Researching the University with an Ethnographic Lens. Ethnography, the study of cultures and subcultures, provides a research opportunity for students to become engaged with researching the culture of the university, as well as subcultures that surround the university. This talk will suggest how ethnographic methodology can help students become better prepared for researching and understanding the institutions and cultures they will come in contact with throughout their lives, from their churches and volunteer non-profit agencies to their university and job sites. Dr. Chiseri-Strater will address how faculty can encourage student engagement with skills that allow them to observe and critique the ways that space is organized, rhetoric is used, interactions take place, and power is enacted in the many groups with whom students interact. The target audience of this lecture is WKUs entire student body and faculty. Dr. David W. Frayer i s a professor in t h e D e p a r t m e n t o f Anthropology at the University of Kansas, Lawrence. He earned anthropology degrees from Miami University, Case Western Reserve University, and the University of Michigan. His research focuses on dental anthropology and the fossil record of human evolution in Europe from about 130,000-10,000 years ago. Current research projects include the Croatian Neandertal site of Krapina, dental morphology and health at the ancient Pakistani village site of Merhgarh, early Homo f r o m E r i t r e a i n northeastern Africa, and the so-called \"hobbit\" species from the island of Flores in I n d o n e s i a . Dr. Frayer h a s p u b l i s h e d extensively on the relationship between Neandertals a n d s u b s e q u e n t E u r o p e a n populations, with topics ranging from language origins and Neandertal toothpick use 6 to evidence for human massacres in the German Mesolithic period and new interpre-tations of the famous European mummy \u00d6tzi. Dr. Frayers presentation is entitled Neandertals and Us. Since their discovery in 1856, Neandertals typically have b e e n c o n s i d e r e d a d i f f e r e n t s p e c i e s o r o f f s h o o t s from the subsequent European Homo sapiens line with little or no contribution to the people who followed them. Yet, a variety of skeletal traits link Neandertals with their European successors. Along with new information from Neandertal biology and culture, it is becoming increasingly difficult to eliminate them from a relationship to the Cro-Magnons who followed them in Europe. The presentations by both speakers are open to the entire campus community. They are swipeable events for WKU students. Currently registered WKU students who have their IDs swiped at these lectures will be eligible for an IPod Touch door prize. One door prize will be awarded at each lecture, and students must be present to win. AWARDS CEREMONYAWARDS CEREMONY WKU faculty and professional staff will judge student presentations, performances, posters, and exhibits at the conference. The judges will select one winner from each of the 35 sessions listed on pages 9-24 in this program. Conference session winners will be announced and acknowledged after Dr. Frayers presentation in the late afternoon. All students who presented papers and posters at the conference, as well as family members, friends, faculty mentors, and administrators, are invited to attend. Receptions with light refreshments will be held before and after the Sigma Xi speaker and awards ceremony.

The purpose of this project was twofold: 1. To assess public health emergency preparedness core competencies and training needs of all staff working at eight local health departments in south-central Kentucky. 2. To make recommendations and suggestions for changes in disaster preparedness training methods and develop educational materials. This study utilized an online survey to assess the health departments staff on knowledge of disaster preparedness. In addition, the employees rated themselves on general and role-specific emergency preparedness competencies, and provided insight into factors that would promote or prevent them from attending training sessions.

Though the ax stands at the beginning of civilization, many Americans do not understand its use. This piece of creative nonfiction explores humanitys connection with the ax through my own personal experience with axes. As a Kentuckian, I have often been placed between two extremes - North and South, rural and urban, sweet and non-sweet tea - and this juxtaposition has shaped not only my view of myself, but my view of rural, southern culture.

Participants included six 10-year old boys with High Functioning Autism/Asperger syndrome assigned to two groups. Groups differed by type of adult training provided. The social constructivist group received scaffolding while the control group was directly instructed. Average frequencies i n We e k s 2-5 were compared to Week 1 (baseline). At baseline, the direct instruction group demonstrated more socially skilled behaviors than did the SC group. Over Weeks 2-5, the SC group showed more improvement than did the control group in gazing at peers while speaking (\u00cf2(1) = 31.707, p < .0001), looking at no one while talking, and in the use of social skills (Fisher's Exact Test, p = .0510). (page 23) Badwaik, Vivek, Lakshmisri Vangala, and Level Interaction the Human Acidic Fibroblast Growth Factor with the Angiogenic Drug Capped Gold Nanoparticles (Dr. Rajalingam Dakshinamurthy) Heparin binding proteins mediates a wide range of important cellular processes which makes this class of protein biomedically very important. Fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF-1) and its receptor (FGFR) are best-characterized members of the heparin binding proteins. Generally, FGFs are known for their strong affinity towards the glycosaminoglycan heparin, as a prerequisite for recognition of a specific tyrosine kinase on the cell surface and are responsible for the cell signal transduction cascade, which leads to its biological activity. In the present study, for the first time we studied the interaction of heparin capped gold nanoparticles (Hep-GNPs) on the FGF-1 and its receptor. Results of the present study will be useful in the development of nanomaterial based pharmacological agents for the treatment of various diseases.

A midway named \"The Mall\" was once the heartbeat of the park, housing rides, games, and food stands. This architectural research project revitalized this vacancy of the park with designs of a multifunctional building and log flume ride appropriately named the Coney Island Mall. To create this structure, extensive research on floodplain construction and sustainable materials was performed. Research and typology studies on museums, gift shops, food courts, theatres, rides, and office spaces also was conducted. The park operations team will be utilizing elements of research and design from this project.

Impressed by his beautiful and sometimes alarming imagery, I chose Aubrey Beardsley, a controversial artist, illustrator and author. His short but productive and contentious life was aligned with Art Nouveau and the Aestheticism movement in England. His illustrations, his contributions to different publications, and his graphic commercial work are the topic points of my collages. My three graphic collaged posters highlight Aubrey Beardsleys works, and my essay gives insight into each of the posters purposes.

My paper and collages will demonstrate the change that occurred during the Art Deco movement and how artists of the time were influenced by architecture, machinery, and cubism 26 within many of their designs. Art deco began in France but quickly spread across the world. Artists such as Jean Dunand, Raymond Templier, and Jean Despres are among those who are responsible for this beautiful and wearable movement. These artists took risks with their designs and with the materials they used. Starting with the Art Deco period we began to see many new metals and stones introduced to the jewelry world that had not been used before and are still being used to this day.

A neutron interrogation system to detect and identify materials is under development at the WKU Applied Physics Institute. Neutrons emitted from the source interact with nuclei inside the interrogated container and excite them. Excited nuclei emit \u00ce\u00b3-rays with energies specific to chemical elements. The proposed system detects these \u00ce\u00b3-rays and makes decisions on possible chemical composition. A special algorithm was developed to simulate experimental spectra from various substances and to analyze them. Based on obtained results the decision-making algorithm was developed and implemented. (page 12) Beers, Amanda* and Farley Norman The Transition from 3-D to 2-D Visual Stimuli in Gifted Education and Its Effect on Paired-Associate Learning (Dr. Farley Norman) A single experiment investigated the influence of varying dimensions of visual stimuli on the ability of academically gifted adolescents to recall paired-associations. Fifty-two participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups. Each group was asked to memorize the same set of 15 paired-word associations. The first group was presented with w o r d s o n l y . T h e s e c o n d g r o u p w a s p r e s e n t e d w i t h words and 2-dimensional (2-D) representations of each word. The third group was presented with words along with 3-dimensional (3-D) representations of the words. The fourth group was also presented words along with 3-D objects; however, this group was instructed to actively manipulate the objects. The recall accuracies of each group were measured directly after the presentation of the last word pair in the set. Large within-group variation prevented significant differences between the accuracy of the groups, indicating that individual learning preferences were a strong factor.

I a n L e e ) Factors of international business are continually fluctuating. The demand for a universal business code of conduct specializing in ethics is overwhelming. Three case studies involving Chiquita Inc., Mattel, and Nike display the dire consequences of poor ethical conduct in todays world. Ethics have grown progressively imperative to international business through increased global commerce, newly applied legislation, and creation of world organizations and agreements. Without a global ethical code, the business environment will be too risky and diversified to progress. The solution is, therefore, implementation of a globally accepted ethical business code that initiates with altering the multinational enterprise structure. This code would best be enforced by the World Trade Organization. The three case studies highlight successful adoption of ethical codes and admired ethical conduct.

This region received record rainfall amounts within a 48-hour period that surpassed existing monthly rainfall records. This 1000-year event caused over $2 billion in private property damage with over 11,000 parcels of land affected. More importantly, 26 fatalities were reported with this flood, with the majority reported from Tennessee. This single rain event broke Nashville Tennessees all-time rainfall record for the month of May. Nashville also recorded its wettest 24-hour rainfall record of 7.21 inches. More noteworthy, a Community Collaborative Rain, Hail and Snow Network rain gauge reported 19.41 inches in Camden, Tennessee for the event. Aside from the 1000-year precipitation event, previous climatic conditions of sustained drought intensified runoff, causing creeks, streams and rivers to swell beyond capacity.

The system monitors and maintains the flow of air over the sample during an experiment and while changing samples. During operation the hardware will be isolated and located near the instrument; however, remote control and monitoring for the user has been provided over the local area network via Ethernet.

Length of survival after A I D S w a s i n v e s t i g a t e d w i t h i t s i n f l u e n c e o n outpatient services for SMI as well as anxiety and sexual disorders. The study involved male veterans using ICD, to predict the number of outpatient visits associated with disorders. Incident rate ratios were used to assess relative change in the number of visits. Overall, 36% of 3,597 participants had outpatient mental health visits. Duration of AIDS had no impact on service use for SMI; however, it had a significant positive association with visits for anxiety and sexual disorders. Lower CD4 cell count and mortality were associated with increased service use for anxiety and sexual disorders, while being an IDU, MSM and having AIDS were predictors for SMI. Duration of AIDS may pose additional challenges in HIV care due to mental health service needs. (page 19) Bickett, William^ and Phillip Womble Gamma-ray Spectra in Neutron-Based Explosives Detection Systems (Dr. Phillip Womble) In the method we are studying, a substance is bombarded with neutrons that in turn react with the nuclei of the atoms within, causing a de-excitation process emitting a variety of gamma-rays. Most of the substances involved in explosives detection emit gamma rays that we suspect are Doppler-broadened (i.e., distorted by the Doppler effect). Our research focuses on the gamma ray spectra from the 6129 keV and the 7116 keV gamma rays from 16^O. In our experiment a water sample was exposed to 14MeV neutrons and the 16^O gamma ray spectra collect using a HPGe Detector positioned at eight different angles with respect to the neutron beam. We will discuss the causes of Doppler broadening and our efforts to prove that Doppler broadening occurs in light nuclei.

J a n e O l m s t e d ) Sports evoke passions and tensions that may explode into derisive attacks against opposition players. In the case of English football, the cultural ties and the immense popularity of the sport amplify these passions and tensions. This paper seeks to unveil how a xenophobic slant prevails in English football media as foreign managers and players begin to flock to the isles. It will review commentary made by the English press and players to examine how these anti-foreign feelings are manifested. The primary areas of concern are the conflict created when foreign managers and players introduce different playing styles, and the use of foreigners as scapegoats. This paper will then briefly detail what this xenophobic phenomenon reveals about the English connection to their football team. The paper will not in any way try to delve into the deeper social meanings of the noted behavior, since the factors of xenophobia do not derive from one institution, which would cause the paper to deviate.

The answer to this question may help us learn more about how to improve eyewitness memory and allow us to study what we remember about people while they are doing certain deeds. I believe that people will be able to remember faces of people who are expressing 28 an unusual emotion to the deed or misdeed. For example, if the person has done a misdeed and looks happy about it, the participant will remember him/her more easily than someone who was not happy about a deed. Further analysis of the data may show a different outcome, and further experimentation will help us determine the causes of enhanced or impaired memory. (page 24) Bowles, Rachel See Elder, Courtney (page 16) Bowman, Brandon* An Overview of Interdisciplinary Education and Its Utility in Public R elations Education (Prof. Ken Payne) Major debate still persists among scholars regarding the efficacy of interdisciplinary education. The researcher first presents the four methodologies of interdisciplinarity. In a public relations curriculum, full implementation of one method may benefit students, whether they become future practitioners or scholars. Case studies (in other fields and in general education) of successful and failed interdisciplinary models provide an avenue for deeper understanding and compelling arguments for interdisciplinarity in public relations curriculum. Reviewing the philosophy of public relations itself in light of the proposed model provides direct evidence for the necessity of interdisciplinarity. Educators, especially those in related fields, may be able to extend this approach into their personal classrooms and into the broader curricula.

Defined by Mark Halliday as \"Ultra-Talk\" Poetry, this chatty, loquacious, often low-intensity poetry embraces opposites and considers any subject, exploring all the connections those ideas invoke. I intend to define Ultra-Talk Poetry by offering brief definitions from critical literature by the Ultra-Talk poets and by reciting examples of published Ultra-Talk Poetry from well-known authors and unknown, including my own published pieces. This definition will take the form of a one-man multimedia performance incorporating pictures of the poets and their works (including David Kirby, Josh Bell, and Mark Halliday, among others), dramatic readings of their work, and a brief synopsis of the literary tenets underlying such an unusual poetic form.

A secondary purpose was to develop a measure to assess tendencies toward rumination about the changes in bodily sensations and tendencies to have escape thoughts with regard to the exercise bout. Participants in this study consisted of 329 undergraduate students with a mean age of 19.94 years. Participants were given two new measures, as well as established measures, of neuroticism, pessimism, trait anxiety, and current exercise habits. The two new measures yielded reliable scores via examination of internal consistency. The results also demonstrated that the new context-specific measures correlated significantly with global measures of neuroticism, pessimism, and trait anxiety. Last, the new measures correlated more strongly with current exercise habits than the global measures.

This region received record rainfall amounts within a 48-hour period that surpassed existing monthly rainfall records. This 1000-year event caused over $2 billion in private property damage with over 11,000 parcels of land affected. Moreover, 31 29 fatalities were reported with this flood. The atmospheric conditions, coupled with teleconnections such as the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation, were conducive to optimal synoptic scale setup for a flooding event. A short amplitude longwave trough covered the western U.S. while ridging took place in the east. Further lift was aided by a jet impulse that subsequently moved through the flow. The meridional flow led to slow eastward progression of surface systems, causing an occluded low pressure maximum over the north-central U.S. to become quasi-stationary.

As part of both teacher education programs, pre-service teachers are required to take an educational psychology course (PSY 310 or SMED 210).

We examined racial differences in four major diagnoses (AIDS defining illness, mental disorders, respiratory conditions, and digestive conditions) and facility visits made for HIV services received by women registered in the Immunology Case Registry. Cross-sectional analysis of service use data for 313 (73%) black and 118 (27%) white women who used services in 2003 was conducted. Chi-square and t-tests were used to assess differences in major diagnoses reported in HIV/AIDS patients and corresponding number of visits for HIV care. Of the 431 women with HIV, 60 (14%) were diagnosed with AIDS but there were no racial differences in AIDS diagnosis. Patients had a mean age of 44.4 years, while the mean age at AIDS diagnosis was 39.4 years. (page 9) Cheak, Brittany* W o m e n o f t h e R a m a y a n a ( D r . D e b o r a h L o g a n ) The Ramayana is one of Indias most ancient narratives (circa 1500 BCE). It has influenced gender attitudes and roles, and can teach modern readers quite a bit about the role of women in the 21st c e n t ury. Some female characters in the Ramayana are portrayed as evil seductresses; Manthara is a serpent-tongued servant, and Kaikeyi is an easily swayed manipulator who twists the kings affection for her desires. However, the story also includes the ideal woman, Sita, who is submissive to her husband and tries valiantly to remain true to him. My analysis of the characters Manthara, Kaikeyi, and Sita examines the assumption that women are passionate, wicked creatures, inferior to men but in need of control. The suggestion of emulation shows the impossible standards to which ordinary women have been, and continue to be, held. (page 18) Cherry, Thomas W . H .

I contend that the progression of the poem represents a progression within the author and can be used to show a progression in the consciousness of the entire world. Furthermore, the end that it reaches is a hopeful one that can be seen as an ideal response to great trauma or fear. Auden moves from a sense of hopelessness and fear, toward frustration and blaming, to the ultimate end of collective consciousness and oneness of the world. Audens poem makes clear the thought of the author and provides insight into a specific way for someone living in the pre-war era of 1939 to deal with the fear and anxiety of the times.

These channels cut into rocks of Mississippian age and formed incised valleys during a period of erosion caused by regional tectonic uplift in the basin and low global sea levels approximately 325 million years ago. They were subsequently filled with predominantly sandy and pebbly river-borne sediments when deposition resumed across the region. These sediments, now lithified, form massive escarpments that rim the basin where they are exposed. They also form highly porous groundwater and petroleum reservoirs where buried in the subsurface further into the basin. Burial depths for the basal valley fills are as much as 2,000 feet in the deepest portions of the Illinois Basin in western Kentucky.

Using the common soil microbe Mycobacterium smegmatis as a host, we isolated and characterized a bacteriophage from a soil sample collected near a creek in Middletown, Kentucky. The purified phage, named \"Woof,\" formed clear, circular plaques roughly 2.5 cm in diameter. The genomic DNA from Woof was purified and analyzed by restriction analysis and gel electrophoresis and the characteristics of the phage capsid and tail were determined by electron microscopy. The results of this analysis suggest that Woof is a unique bacteriophage.

We examined this relationship by presenting a sample of first-time college freshmen (n=92) with ten vignettes depicting stressful college-related, life adjustment events. Participants rated how likely they were to use particular coping strategies after completing measures of depression. Results reveal that having more depressive symptoms was associated with less planning and active coping but with more venting and attempts to seek emotional 31 support.

This study is to determine how mycorrhizae improve available plant nutrient uptake from two different production systems. Measurements were taken on yield, vegetative quality, and soil nutrient content. Two plant species were chosen, tomatoes (c.v. Big Beef) and bush beans (c.v. Tenderette). A two-factor factorial design was used with three MO- 0 mycorrhizae, M1- 1x rate, and M2- 2x rate. Each mycorrhizal input was replicated three times in both the conventional and organic systems. Initial results from the first year show that there is no difference in yield based on mycorrhizae additions at any rate.

The objective of this study is to determine not only how important the conflict was, but also to review the reasons the battle has become marginalized. Whether or not the research leads to the conclusion that the clash between the Cross and the Crescent at the Battle of Tours/Poiters was not at all important in preventing Islam from spreading throughout Europe, one can reason that the Frankish victory resulted in the rise of the Carolingian Dynasty, where the father of Europe, Charlemagne, would eventually shape the face of Western Europe.

One must choose sides, and it is almost automatically assumed white represents good while black represents evil. At what point, though, do we reverse our perceptions? In American Gothic literature, Edgar Allan Poe helped shift the connotations of the black/white symbolic by weaving it into his expressions of the uncanny perverse. The idea of a white wickedness versus benign blackness within the Gothic grotesque is carried further into popular culture when comparing Poes story, \"The Black Cat,\" with its modern counterpart, \"The White Cat,\" by Joyce Carol Oates. This essay explores how both illustrate the evident inversion in pop culture of traditional black/white binaries.

(Dr. Martin Stone) Fixation of atmospheric nitrogen is vital to plant life. Many cyanobacteria fix nitrogen and can associate with fungi to form lichens. The gelatinous lichen Collema sp. is a Warren County native that inhabits bare soil. During periods of sufficient soil moisture, it fixes nitrogen, photosynthesizes, and changes in appearance from a dry, hard flake to hydrated, swollen, and jelly-like. When applied to the soil surface of a planted pot, Collema can act as a nitrogen fertilizer supplement through the release of the nitrogen fixed by the cyanobacteria symbiont into the soil. Preliminary studies were conducted to examine Collemas rate of growth, rate of hydration, and the effect of nitrogen produced on plant growth. The results suggest that Collema is a promising specimen for future use as a natural nitrogen fertilizer supplement.

These zoning profiles were used to identify the petrogenetic processes responsible for generating different lavas.

Bowling Green currently houses an organic farmers market available only seven months of the year. Having a place that is accessible year round would benefit Bowling Green and farmers who rely on local support. Research of organic markets has resulted in a design that would thrive in Bowling Green. The proposed indoor retail space is framed with steel and timber and houses indoor farmer stands, produce and shelf items. Retail and production greenhouses constructed with steel columns interact with the indoor retail space. Polycarbonate plastic lines the greenhouses and a gable roof system allows for natural light and ventilation. Organic markets are growing within the U.S. and this proposed organic market would support Bowling Green and the local organic farmers from surrounding areas.

Using Raman spectroscopy, the interactions of hydrogen peroxide with nitrate during photolysis were studied. Samples of nitrate and hydrogen peroxide were photolyzed and Raman spectra were collected over the course of three hours for each sample. Samples were tested in which only the hydrogen peroxide or the potassium nitrate was photolyzed, in addition to samples where both species were photolyzed. In another study the effect of the counter ion was tested by using samples of ammonium nitrate, calcium nitrate, and sodium nitrate. This was done to assess the impact of different electric fields on the structure of the nitrate ion. There was a distinct difference between the Raman spectra of the samples.

According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention more than 440,000 deaths in the U.S are related to cigarette smoking. In past 20 years, there has been a considerable decrease in the number of smokers; however, only a minimal reduction in college-age smokers has been observed. Approximately, 85% of current adult smokers started smoking before the age of 21 years; therefore, smoking in youth is of particular concern as early initiation is associated with life-long smoking. In a recent study, more than 28% of college students are smokers, which is significantly higher compared to the U.S adult smoking rate (20.6%). Smoking among college students is strongly influenced by gender.

Modeling is a key component to any forecast. This study examines performance of several parameterization scheme combinations in the Weather Research and Forecasting Model. These include cloud microphysics, cumulus parameterization schemes and the planetary boundary layer with 12 WRF simulations. The WRF simulations for temperature, dewpoint, relative humidity, and precipitation for several locations in south-central Kentucky were compared to Kentucky Mesonet observations. Overall the most satisfactory combination of schemes included the WRF single-moment 3 class Microphysics Scheme for microphysics, Kain-Fritsch for cumulus parameterization.

These plants are composed of a series of colorful bracts, each housing one flower. The flowers bloom for one day each in an alternating pattern until all the bracts have opened; afterwards the flowering portion of the plant dies. In January 2011 we conducted a study at the Cloudbridge Nature Preserve in Costa Rica to examine the habitat preference of the native Heliconias. Data was collected for several variables: elevation, vicinity to water, forest type, percentage canopy cover, height, life within bracts, and coloration. Although the data collected was largely preliminary, results do indicate a preference for nearness to running water and show that Heliconias are absent in elevations greater than 6000 ft.

These systems are capable of producing hurricane-force winds across portions of the eastern United States. This study provides a climatological foundation for high-wind observations that are due to post-tropical storm systems. Post-tropical storms were identified and tracked using six hourly observations from the National Hurricane Centers HURDAT dataset.

For this study, the geography and climatology of post-tropical storms and resultant high winds were analyzed using geographic information systems. Initial findings show that of the 47% of all post-tropical systems, 25% made landfall in the U.S. and were used for this study. Post-tropical systems primarily occur between 41\u00c2\u00b0N-45\u00c2\u00b0N, east of 100\u00c2\u00b0W, with a mean migration toward the northeast.

In comparing the relative ratios of these structures through spectroscopy it is possible to observe changes in the environment of the solution. Through IR spectroscopy we observed the change in the asymmetric stretches as a function of time following a five-minute photolysis of aqueous solutions of nitrate. Separately, aqueous solutions of nitrate were analyzed as a function of time following photolysis under constant exposure to the LED source. This study was performed at various temperatures to determine temperature dependence of the nitrate stretches using a computer controlled cell. Benzoic acid was used to determine if peak splitting is viable as an environmental indicator.

The study proposed to identify intake of fruits and vegetables, perceptions of intake, consumption preferences, and common barriers. Respondents included women from United States (n=100), Burma (30), South America (33), Bosnia (10), and other countries (7). Healthy People 2010 recommends eating two cups of fruits and three cups of vegetables per day. Results indicate that most respondents ate one or two cups of fruits and vegetables per day and felt that amount adequate. Burmese women perceived high cost (70%) and unavailability (33.3%) as the major barriers, while American (48%), Spanish (42.4%) and Bosnian (40%) women felt that lack of time was the major hindering factor to eating fruits and vegetables. This presentation will provide information on how to tailor an intervention and develop materials to better meet the needs of immigrant and non-immigrant WIC women.

An examination of the spatiotemporal aspect of a fire can reveal information about potential post-burn impacts and is useful for natural resource management. The south Asian country of Nepal has effectively no fire management and limited research has been conducted on the occurrences of fire throughout the country. In this study we analyzed the burned areas of Nepal over a 10-year period using remote sensing and geographic information systems. The three physiographic regions of Nepal were examined independently to account for differences in land cover and human activity. Additionally, burned areas in protected parks were contrasted to non-protected areas. The results are presented spatially and the implications for resource management are interpreted.

Although content-area instructors may not have been trained in teaching reading strategy and may feel as though teaching reading is not their job, it is an expectation that could largely be met by the implementation of motivational strategies. This exploratory study utilized the expectancy theory of motivation and was conducted to determine which strategies and practices would be most motivational for high school students to read. In a survey created by the researcher, student participants were identified as having high or low self-efficacy and high or low value of reading. Also included in the survey were 27 motivational strategies and practices garnered from previous studies and research among all age groups.

T h e s e m e s t e r-long project was to isolate and characterize novel bacteriophages from the environ-ment. Students collected soil samples and enriched them for viruses that grow on Mycobacterium smegmatis. After several rounds of purification, the phage was viewed by electron microscopy to determine its morphology. The phage particles had an icosahedral head and a tail and the purified phage was named \"HerpaDerpicus.\" HerpaDerpicus genomic DNA was isolated and analyzed by restriction digestion and gel electrophoresis. The results of this analysis were compared to the results reported by the other class participants. From these comparisons, we conclude that HerpaDerpicus is a unique mycobacteriophage.

After several rounds of purification, a bacteriophage was isolated and it was named Pestilence. Electron microscopy was used to view the purified phage particles. Many bacteriophages have the same morphology, but they can differ dramatically on the genetic level. Therefore, genomic DNA from Pestilence particles was isolated and analyzed by restriction analysis and gel electrophoresis. From this analysis, we conclude that unique bacteriophages can be easily recovered from the soil. (page 23) Harp, Jessica W o r l d W a r I I P r o p a g a n d a P o s t e r D e s i g n ( P r o f .

In the Himalayan country of Nepal, elevation differences and complex geography define species richness in north-south transects. Mountain slopes, in general, have unimodal distribution of species, gradually decreasing towards the top. Climate and other environmental variables are responsible for this trend. High altitude and harsh climatic factors limit the richness but increase endemism. The trend is interrupted by increasing human activities, d i s p e r s a l b a r r i e r s , c o m p e t i t i v e e x c l u s i o n , a n d invasive species.

(page 10) Humagain, Kamal See Gourley, Ryan (page 15) Hunton, Ryan Poetry between the Lines: The Significance of Stage Directions in Eugene O'Neill's Plays (Dr. Walker Rutledge) Many critics consider Eugene O'Neill to be the premier playwright of the modern American theatre. In Harold Blooms foreword to ONeills magnum opus, Long Days Journey into Night ( 1 9 4 1 ) , h e c a l l s a t t e n t i o n t o Eugene ONeills stage directions in the final moments of the play. Bloom asks, \"How much of the power here comes from what [the characters] Tyrone and Mary say, and how much from the extraordinarily effective stage directions?\" Throughout O'Neill's career, he was criticized mostly for failing to master or capture the beauty of authentic American English. While this criticism is argued even today, ONeills genius lies instead in his ability to incorporate into his stage directions poetic subtleties that cannot be expressed with words. Here in the italics one finds what enriches his drama and transforms it into art. (page 11) Hutchison, Sean Influence of Decadal Climate Variability on Vegetation in Mammoth Cave National Park (Dr. John All) The causes of global climate change are a much-researched topic; however, the influence of climatic changes on environmental systems is currently understudied. This study focuses on the implications of climate change on vegetation in central Kentucky. Using remote sensing, the photosynthetic activity of Mammoth Cave National Park is tracked for a ten-year period. Vegetation maps for Mammoth Cave are overlaid on the remote sensing data, which are clipped according to the dominant vegetation classification. The remotely sensed vegetation classes are then statistically tested against climate data, and correlations between vegetative productivity and climate are sought. Future changes in vegetation are extrapolated from the findings.

Its treatment is costly because of intensity of services, especially when mental health issues are involved. We examined factors associated with first-time receipt of alcohol abuse treatment in formal healthcare settings in the state of Kentucky. Analysis was based on the state level Treatment Episode Data Set - A d m i s s i o n s o f t h e 2 0 0 8 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Data Archive (SAMHDA). First-time treatment for substance abuse was given to 9,967 individuals in the state. Substance abuse and treatment facility types were assessed. Nearly 40% of the patients had alcohol abuse problems. One-third of the patients were aged between 21 and 29 years, and the majority were male (64.1%), white (87.3%) and received treatment in outpatient settings (60%). The data showed 33.5% of the patients were daily users of their reported primary substance and 24.2% had psychiatric disorders.

In my art making process, it is knowing there are no truths, no speakable absolutes; the pursuit of decision making departs from a place of isolation that cannot anchor right from wrong, good from evil, terrorist from revolutionary but only map visual decisions. It is in that questioning and doubting of myself that my imagery and mark-making occur, not one idea, not one truth, but the overall essence of reality, both abstract and concrete. Structures once sound become fleeting and ambiguous, earth shifts and perspectives bow, all in an influx that cripples me and makes me question again and again to attempt the understanding of what is trying to exist.

This region contains many endemic species, including a viviparous toad, orchids, and an otter shrew. Biodiversity is extremely threatened due to habitat destruction via a rapidly expanding human population, iron ore mine development, agriculture, as well as bushmeat hunting. Dung beetle samples were collected during June 2010 from grassland and forest habitats as well as in the nearby lower elevation forest in the Bossou Chimp reserve. A total of 158 specimens, including 20 species, were collected; 18 species were discovered in Bossou and 16 species in each of the grassland and forest.

Millions of useful and commercially produced compounds can be synthesized using this methodology. Using a new preparation of ortho-lithio-para-Bromoanisole and ortho-lithio-para-Iodoanisole, 19 derivatives have been prepared using the selective and regiospecific process. A special ortho-metalating reagent, ortho-lithiodimethylbenzylamine (o-LiDMBA) is produced and quenched in the laboratory. Using this specific reagent we were able to preserve the halogen (Br, I). This o-LiDMBA needs no purification and the DMBA reagent can be extracted upon acidic work-up. Upon extraction dimethylbenzylamine (DMBA) then can be recycled and used in further synthesis.

The Clean Air Act is critical for the established limits on air pollution and the continued improvement of air quality in the United States. The Clean Air Act was created to ensure that Americans were not being unnecessarily exposed to harmful air pollutants. It is the legislation that allows for the regulation and control over air pollutants and the sources that release those air pollutants. The Clean Air Act is important to the maintenance and improvement of air quality in the United States. Without the Clean Air Act to regulate pollutant sources, the air could be toxic to vulnerable populations in the U.S., if not toxic for the U.S. as a whole, causing different cancers and other health problems. Since it was created there have been several changes to the Clean Air Act to meet the demands of a concerned society. The original intent of the Act has been vastly expanded.

This research will determine timing of emplacement of the Cowhole dikes by examining the contacts between dikes. Feldspars from porphyritic dikes appear to be mixed aphanitic dikes, suggesting coeval emplacement. Analysis of feldspar compositions will test this hypothesis.

This leads to two competing hypotheses about moral decisions within a sexual context. Either morality 42 within a sexual context is the same for both genders, or morality within a sexual context is altered by that context in ways that are consistent with gender-specific sexual strategies. To test these hypotheses, we presented sexual and non-sexual moral dilemmas to participants, asked them to resolve each dilemma, and assessed their stage of moral development based on their response. Our results will reveal how men and women make moral decisions and whether the genders differ in how they approach a moral dilemma concerning sex. This study will give us a greater insight into how men and women make moral decisions within sexual contexts.

A theory-based 76-item survey was completed by 360 college students at a south-central U.S. university assessing their knowledge and perceptions about organ donation. Intentions were strongly predicted by donors attitudes, willingness to communicate, and ability. Fear of organ donation and mistrust of health care were the most common reasons for non-consent. Students who had donated blood were twice as likely to be organ donors (p=0.001). The typical non-donor was more likely to be male, nonwhite, has fewer positive attitudes (p=0.03), willingness to communicate (p=0.001), motivation to comply (p=0.01) and ability (p=0). Results can certainly be used to develop organ donation consent improvement programs among college students.

Surveys to assess levels of stress and sport team identification were completed by participants prior to a football game, and a follow up survey was given over the telephone two to four weeks later. It was hypothesized that those with a high level of sport team identification would report lower levels of stress while at the game than at home. It was also hypothesized that fans with a low level of sport team identification would report no difference in level of stress at the game and at home. Results partially supported the hypotheses.

Further, given that this event took place during a particularly strong negative El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation phase (i.e., La Ni\u00f1a), the possible relationship of this global teleconnection with this rare and particularly strong cool-season tornado is explored. Initial findings show that due to the cool-season timing, the synoptic environment preconditioned the event with limited atmospheric instability. However, modest-to-strong vertical wind shear was present. In addition to the rarity of this winter-time F-3 tornado, this event was especially noteworthy because it was the first confirmed tornado in Owensboros 200-year history.

Some of those Americans are misdiagnosed and, therefore, do not get proper treatment. One reason for misdiagnoses is that clinicians have been known to disagree on what diagnosis best fits the symptoms (Hatchett et al. 2010, Youngston et al. 2008). This could be caused by various factors, one of them being the DSM-IV-TR (2000). The DSM-IV-TR has long been the source for diagnosing psychological disorders, and it has been frequently criticized for having classification errors, poor reliability, and poor validity (Baca-Garcia et al. 2007; Kendell and Jablensky 2003; McLauren 2007; Stinchfield 2003, 2005).

We examined levels of Trx proteins in normoxia and hypoxia to find which and to what degree the proteins were expressed. We also ran proliferation studies to find how the two conditions affected PASMC proliferation. To find if Trx1 protein had a role in hypoxia-induced proliferation, we also knocked down Trx1 protein using a specific siRNA. We found that Trx1 levels were induced after 48/72 hours of hypoxia exposure, and that the Trx1 protein is necessary for the hypoxia-induced proliferation of PASMC. We speculate that Trx1 may represent a therapeutic target for PH.

We have developed an HI spectrum fitting program to identify cold HI emission regions. When applied to HI surveys from the Arecibo radio telescope, our method yields spatially coherent maps of gas temperature, optical depth, and other properties. To evaluate the algorithm's reliability, we ran Monte Carlo simulations of many HI spectra. We found that the biases in fitted values become worse for higher levels of noise, but our fits are mostly reliable for a S/N of less than 10. Unexpected opacity biases at low noise are under investigation.

A total of 288 ticks were collected with forceps and placed into plastic vials containing 7 0 % e t h a n o l . T h r e e s p e c i e s w e r e i d e n t i f i e d ; 9 1 . 7 % o f t h e t i c k s w e r e Amblyoma americanum, 6.6% were Dermacentor variabilis, and 0.35% were Ixodes scapularis. After identifying the species and sex of each tick, a Qiagen Q1Aamp\u00c2\u00ae Kit was used to isolate DNA.

In both cases, the size of the particles was controlled by adjusting organotrialkoxy silane composition, molar ratios of base, and TEOS concentrations. The size, shape, and surface morphology of these functionalized particles were visualized using transmission electron microscopy. Their compositions were confirmed by ATR-IR, thermogravimetric analysis and elemental analysis. The photophysical properties of these nanohybrids were studied in solution phase and have further provided evidence of successful incorporation of poly(3-hexyl thiophene) and perylenediimide into siloxane core structure.

The site and degree of methylation regulates the number of biological processes, while aberrant methylation can lead to human pathologies. The first aim of our research was to explore the role of JMJD-2 in lifespan and aging in C. elegans by co ndu ct i ng l i f e span and pharynge al pu mpi ng assay. C o nse qu e nt l y, t he ro l e o f JMJD-2 in reproduction and survivability was tested via brood count and embryonic lethality assay.

The overall goal of the present study was to determine the impact of dietary supplementation with antioxidants on gene expression in the brains of non-infected mice and in mice infected with T. gondii u s i n g microarray analysis. RNA was isolated from the brains of C57BL/6 mice, and an Agilent Oligo Whole Mouse Genome Microarray (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) was performed. A total of 48 chips were normalized by Z ratios and the Data Driven Harr Fisch Normalization methods. Differentially expressed genes were identified by applying thresholds to identify significant values and the results were compared between the methods.

Undergraduates served as participants for Study 1 (n=116) and Study 2 (n=149). Participants completed two 2-mile bouts on a treadmill for each study. Trial 1 consisted of exercising at a preferred exercise pace for two miles. After exercising participants were asked to identify a strategy for improving intensity in Study 1 and enjoyment in Study 2. A week later participants completed Trial 2, in which they completed two miles on a treadmill while implementing their strategies. Study 1 revealed that participants were able to significantly improve their two-mile times. The most common strategy was task relevant/motivational methods. Study 2 revealed that participants significantly improved their enjoyment and reduced their rate of perceived exertion even though they exercised at the same intensity.

It is frequently found sitting atop a variety of zeolite minerals, which gives insight into its porous zeolitic structure. These types of structures have the potential to sequester hazardous chemical byproducts due to their very high ion selectivity. During synthesis and various ion exchanges, changes to cavansites structure and chemical composition were determined by using a combination of Raman microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and DSC/TGA for phase and structural analysis to determine the mechanisms of ion selectivity.

Based on this work and subsequent research and discussion, it would appear that the world reached a global condition of peak oil production in 2005 (as determined by the International Energy Agency in 2006). The impacts of such an event have been projected by Duncan and Tainter, who suggest that this energy peak will lead to severe economic contraction. Any economic occurrence of such magnitude would have ramifications that have the potential to result in a social collapse not unlike those studied by Diamond. By compiling all of the implications of the aforementioned works, we describe an interplay that may result in major changes for which we are currently unprepared.

The structure and chemical composition of these engineered products were determined by using a combination of Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. This unveils the complex mechanism that makes ion exchange so easy and allows for simple chemical alterations to improve the synthesized products. Ion exchanges are carried out in-situ in order to attempt to understand the controls of the processes involved in ion exchange, in hopes of developing new, novel materials.

According to current Iranian government purview, such popular demonstration, in defiance of official government business, is punishable by death. The question becomes, what would possibly motivate such a seemingly loyalist populace to break ranks with their religious and governmental authority and risk death to make a statement? My research will examine the causes and effects of such an uprising and explore the motivations and rationalizations of both the dissident movement and the established religious authority. (page 15) Rapolu, Chaitanya, Dhatri Ravipati, and Kevin Williams by Analogs of the Anticancer Drug Cisplatin (Dr. Kevin Williams) We are investigating the interaction of a series of platinum complexes with the enzyme papain, a digestive enzyme. These platinum complexes are structural analogs of the anticancer drug cisplatin. Papain has both a cysteine and a histidine residue in the active site; both amino acids are potential targets for platinum complexes. Commercial papain has the cysteine partially inactivated, and thus excess cysteine must be added for full activity. We have found that the addition of cysteine and subsequent dialysis can influence the inhibition profile of our platinum complexes.

These platinum complexes can potentially inhibit subtilisin by interacting with the histidine residue of the active site; thus, the inhibition can be a means of probing for site-specific reaction of a platinum compound with a particular protein. We are investigating how the size, shape, and relative reactivities of the platinum complexes affect the rate and extent of enzyme inhibition.

A total of 89 surveys were returned. Almost 15% of the respondents were unaware that rabies was a real threat to the health of their family. While 47% of the respondents cited economic reasons for not having their pets vaccinated, and 82% of them said that none of the barriers discussed presented any problems in getting their pets vaccinated against rabies. In conclusion, survey respondents do not demonstrate knowledge of the importance of rabies vaccination and thus do not vaccinate pets adequately. Educational and promotional programs are necessary to influence the pet-owning public to have rabies vaccines administered to their animals.

We seek to solidify possible environmental trends 49 in SN Ia rates from direct measures of host galaxy properties, using the sample of approximately 40 SNe Ia collected by the Nearby Galaxies Supernova Search project. This on-going study tests the influence of several variables on SN Ia production efficiency: parent population age, rate of star-formation, and metallicity. The complete sample will provide a validity test of the mostly indirect trends being established for SNe Ia from other surveys, and may ultimately steer future investigations towards more precise SN Ia cosmology. Proteins: Relevance in Biopharmaceuticals (Dr. Rajalingam Dakshinamurthy) The progression of using biomolecules found in humans, such as proteins rather than synthesized organic molecules, has had a positive impact in the biopharmaceutical field. This has led our lab to develop a new cost-effective and efficient purification method compared to the currently available methods for heparin binding proteins. Heparin binding proteins consist of a plethora of protein families, but the most important family i s t h e fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). In most heparin binding protein purification protocols, it is common to collect the protein through conventional heparin column chromatography, which has many disadvantages and results in higher cost for production of recombinant proteins. However, our new method reports efficient off-column purification of FGF-1 from soluble fractions and purification of insoluble inclusion bodies like the FGFR using a weak amberlite cation (IRC) exchanger.

When it comes to adapting Poe's works to film, the director has the task of not only capturing that mood, but extending it to a 90-minute production. This research paper discusses Poe-related films directed by the \"King of the B-Movies\" Roger Corman, and analyzes the films s u c c e s s f u l a d a p t a t i o n s f rom page to screen. Corman produced/directed a cycle of films loosely inspired by the works of Poe, including The Masque of the Red Death (1964). Using an excess of visually lavish sets, Corman created a \"nightmarish world of melodramatic fantasy,\" for which Poe is highly noted. Noting key theories in film, especially in the horror genre, my paper examines the filmic factors that contribute to the mythic aura of Edgar Allan Poe.

Here we report the green synthesis of metallic gold nanoparticles (GNPs) from the starch extracted from potato. The nanoparticles have been synthesized using the bioreduction properties of starch on the chloroaurate anions in aqueous solution, at room temperature and at atmospheric pressure. The characterization of synthesized gold nanoparticles by different techniques indicates the formation of spherical, pure metallic gold nanoparticles in the size range of 5-20 nm.

The use of social media as a means to communicate with others is increasing at an amazing rate. Facebook has become my generations favorite way to communicate with friends and family and \"Facebook\" has unofficially become a verb that many college students use. While social media such as Facebook, Linked-In and email may encourage American college students to communicate with international students beyond the perimeters of the classroom and campus, it seems that Facebook is on the way to becoming a substitute for face-to-face intercultural interactions. Whether it will enhance or diminish the extent and quality of intercultural communication is an important question to be studied.

The objective of this experiment was to isolate 50 and characterize a novel bacteriophage from the environment. Mycobacterium smegmatis, a harmless bacterium commonly found in soil, facilitated the enrichment and recovery of mycobacteriophages. A single phage type was purified to homogeneity and was named TiroTheta9 (TT9). TT9 genomic and sequenced. genome was annotated and compared to the genomes of other mycobacteriophages. We conclude that TiroTheta9 is a unique mycobacteriophage with close similarity to mycobacteriophages of the A4 subcluster. These results extend our understanding of mycobacteriophage diversity and contribute new information the growing database of annotated phage genomes.

T e d H o v e t ) In 2008, Christopher Nolans The Dark Knight mesmerized film audiences with its complex story. The movie expanded the lore of Batman into a platform for social commentary, expressing views about privacy protection, corrupt law enforcement, and basic human morality. These issues strengthen Nolans larger exploration of t h e r i g h t e o u s n e s s o f The Dark Knights m a i n c h a r a c t e r s , Batman and the Joker. Presenting comic figures as imperfect humans, the film portrays them as having all the wounds and ambitions that we viewers might possess. We empathize with each character and struggle to define either one as completely heroic or villainous. This essay will use research into the film and its influences to study the motivations of the two characters and to analyze factors affecting audience views of heroes and villains. It will argue that it is Batmans unwavering hope for humanity and the Jokers lack of hope that finalizes viewers archetypal classifications of hero and villain. (page 11) Schuck, Julie Myths of Mortality (Prof. Laurin Notheisen) My work is primarily narrative. I enjoy telling the stories that I learned as a child. Mythology and folktales are especially powerful sources of imagery because these stories are simple enough to be told quickly, but complex enough to communicate multiple meanings. Recently, I have been exploring themes concerned with mortality, that brief time we spend in frail and vulnerable bodies. Norse, Greek, and Mayan mythologies all tell of the tension between the gods and humanity as they struggle to decide how to best use this limited resource. I am inspired by the work of William Blake and Akseli Gallen Kallela, two artists who explored mythological, religious, and folklore imagery in their work. Their visual vocabularies were highly personal, but their images successfully engage viewers from very divergent backgrounds and traditions.

Degradation of basement membrane (BM) plays a significant role in tumor metastasis, but precisely how tumors are able to break through BM is not fully known. Various matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) are known to be upregulated in invasive tumors and involved in BM degradation, however clinical trials involving MMP inhibitors have shown little success. This suggests a complex process of BM degradation that may involve a variety of factors including MMPs. Utilizing genetic techniques in Drosophila we have identified several candidate genes that may regulate BM degradation. These candidate genes will be further examined to determine if they play a role in BM degradation by tumors.

Heidegger presents an idea of art and poetry that hinges on the idea of new experience. The Origin of the Work of Art is not an attempt at defining art per se; rather, Heidegger attempted to find a way of seeing in a completely new way that necessitates the poetic nature of the truth of art. Starting with the basic \"thing\" and moving into the work of art itself, Heidegger explains the truth of the work of art that exists independently within itself, and is only hindered when approached with definite meaning. Through an explanation of the material quality, openness, and lack of definition of the nature of the work of art, I will to explain why Heidegger insists on ambiguity in the truth of art.

The U.S. Coast Guard, unsatisfied with current coastline defenses, initiated the Maritime Domain Awareness program to increase the security of U.S ports. To fulfill this need, Western Kentucky University and the West Virginia High Tech Consortium Foundation have developed an acoustic impulse generator to interdict underwater intruders and disrupt hostile equipment. The technology uses a highly-collimated acoustic wave (moving at 1500 meters per second in water) to deter underwater threats and allows coastline security to respond over large distances with little warning. The National Institute for Hometown Security and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security sponsored the development of the acoustic transducer.

Another component considered in this study is changes in the reproductive state of females, which can lead to a shift in hierarchy position. No significant differences were found between the cortisol levels of dominant and subordinate animals, nor were there differences in their activity behaviors. We also found no differences in the activity behaviors and cortisol levels of lactating and non-lactating females. Our findings do not support the dominance-stress hypothesis and indicate that there is little difference in the activity behavior of dominant and subordinate animals in this domestic situation.

A study conducted by IOM revealed more than half of all the emergency care in U.S. is uncompensated. This study focuses on emergency department (ED) visit patterns in the Midwestern states of Iowa and Nebraska. Factors relevant to ED visits, such as age, gender, length of stay (LOS), and admission status, were investigated. The findings showed mean age for all ED patients was 38 years, whereas that of patients who were admitted as a result of ED visit was about 60 years. Payer information for ED services indicates less than 60% of the elderly were covered by Medicare. For this reason, an increased portion of uncompensated ED care delivered to the elderly population has the potential to add financial stress to the already overburdened emergency services.

Traditional methods of deterrence through direct human intervention with confrontation have proven dangerous and often ineffectual against smaller animal due of lack of detection. The purpose of this project is to develop a multi-tiered approach to deter potentially harmful wildlife activity in the rural farming communities in impoverished African regions.

(page 13) Steele, Chris, Ben Topp, and Matt Bracken Bio-Generated Greenhouse Heating System (Dr. Kevin Schmaltz) In the United States there are many needs for abundant clean energy. Though composting waste may not be used on a large scale, it certainly is an innovative idea for harnessing energy that would otherwise be lost. The goal for the Greenhouse Composting Project was to look at the feasibility of using the heat created from decomposing material to heat the root zone of the plants that are housed in the WKU Greenhouse during the winter months. This would result in a severe cut in energy cost. The WKU Agriculture Department is contracted to dispose of the city of Bowling 53 Greens leaf collection, which it, in turn, sells to local farmers for fertilizer once the leaves break down. Since the decomposing process produces heat, we considered ways ideas for capturing and utilizing this energy. The idea for harnessing this energy was to place the decomposing material on top of a large concrete pad that contains a network of pipes with water serving as the means of absorbing, transporting, and radiating heat in the WKU Greenhouse.

The findings suggest that women are more likely than men to cope by seeking emotional support from peers. Women also are more likely to seek advice when presented with a problem, as well as being more likely to vent. Men, on the other hand, are more likely to use denial and humor to cope. Another finding is that women are more likely to be depressed. The lower rate of depression in men may be due to the use of denial as a way of dealing with a problem. Men do not actively think or talk about a problem like women do because they deny it exists; therefore, men do not show as many signs of depression because the problem does not have as much of an effect on their lives. (page 23) Stephenson, David See Wittman, Rebecca (page 20) Stewart, Colleen* Reporting on Women in Sustainable Agriculture (Prof. Mac McKerral) Women are farming. Current trends in the reorganization of farm work, as well as the rise of environmental and sustainability concerns, are redefining gender roles on the farm. My research started in India where farmer suicides sweep the nation and widowed women are beginning to farm independently. In Belize, women are farming more, too, and the Ministry of Agriculture awards a Woman Farmer of the Year. In the U.S., the number of total people farming is going down, but each year, the number of female farmers is on the rise. Women are starting to farm independently, and sustainably. Women are growing food on a smaller scale and oftentimes without chemicals and pesticides. Agriculture is empowering women to empower their communities and change the way our world eats and operates.

We will be looking at three different wavelengths of light as the balloon travels through the atmosphere: near-ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared. Two payloads will be used, one containing light sensors collecting broad illumination information and humidity, the other containing a spectrometer collecting specific irradiance in regular time intervals. We will test atmospheric reflectance within the troposphere and stratosphere, and compare our measures to any previous data or theoretical expectations. Future experiments may track long-term reflectance of the Earth's atmosphere, either growing in strength, staying the same, or weakening over time.

A new photochemical method to synthesis the trans-dioxoruthenium(VI) porphyrins has been successfully developed. The dichlororuthenium(IV) complexes are prepared by refluxing corresponding ruthenium(II) carbonyl complexes in CCl4, followed by counterion exchanging with AgClO3 to form the porphyrin-ruthenium(IV) dichlorates as photo-liable precursors. Photolysis of phorphyrin-ruthenium(IV) dichlorate complexes visible light results in hemolytic cleavage of the O-Cl bond in the chlorates to give trans-dioxorutherium(VI) species. The generality of this method was demonstrated by the generation of the trans-dioxoruthenium(VI) porphyrins.

A dye trace was initiated using sulphorhodamine-B during a major rain event in a known groundwater recharge area where manure was applied to the ground. Water samples and geochemical data were collected every four hours before, during, and after the storm to track the transport and residence time of the epikarst water and organic soil amendments during high flow condition. The data show a rapid epikarstic response to the rainfall event, with changes in geochemistry indicating meteoric water moving through the cave rapidly and transporting bacteria from epikarst storage. The results indicate that significant precipitation events can rapidly impact the pathways and timing of contaminant transport through the epikarst zone. 10) Vangala, Lakshmisri, Nanoparticles (Dr. Rajalingam Dakshinamurthy) In recent years significant research is going on in the development of bio-compatible gold nanoparticles (GNPs) for various biomedical applications. In the present study, three average sizes of sugar-encapsulated GNPs were synthesized using green methodology and tested for their antibacterial activities. The antibacterial activity of GNPs was examined by different microbiological assays. To further understand the mechanism, bacterial cells were treated with propidium iodide (PI) and examined by steady-state fluorescence and TEM analysis. Results clearly suggest that bio-compatible sugar-GNPs exert their size dependent antibiotic actions via disrupting the bacterial cell membrane. Hence, these NPs may be useful for the removal of bacterial pathogens from water, food, and various environments and for clinical applications.

In this context, we have an interest in photochemical generation of highly reactive metal-oxo intermediates that, upon oxidization of substrates, give low-valent metal complexes that can be recycled for catalytic oxidations. In this study, we explore the applicability of ruthenium porphyrins, which are known to display good oxidative robustness, in a light-driven catalytic process. We have demonstrated that the ruthenium(IV)-\u00ce\u00bc-oxo bisporphyrins catalyzed efficient aerobic oxidation of alkenes and activated hydrocarbons using visible light and atmospheric oxygen. The observed photocatalytic oxidation is ascribed to a photodisproportionation.

Long-term exposure to high arsenic concentrations above the World Health Organizations standard of 10 parts per billion has been linked to serious health effects including digestive tract disease and cancer. Although effective purification techniques exist, their implementation is an unrealistic goal by many third-world nations for a variety of reasons. The most common of these is the expense associated with the implementation and maintenance of what are typically complex procedures. Our research goal is to find a cost-effective method of arsenic purification that is a feasible alternative to current arsenic purification methodology for third-world countries.

To identify the specific role of GH in hair cell regeneration and the possible cellular mechanisms, zebrafish were divided into a baseline group (no sound exposure, no injection) and a sound-exposed group. After sound exposure, GH or buffer was injected intra-peritoneally.

Time-course curves were established by combining baseline, psed1 (post-sound exposure day1), psed2, and psed3 data. GH demonstrated potent ability to promote hair cell regeneration, which may be achieved through stimulating cellular proliferation and inhibiting cellular apoptosis.

Reaction of cisplatin with proteins likely precedes reaction with DNA in the body, and size and shape of the platinum complexes often affect reactions with protein targets more than with DNA targets. In this study, cisplatin analogs were reacted with the amino acid histidine, and the reactions were monitored by NMR spectroscopy. Rate constants were determined and compared with those previously obtained for methionine, a primary amino acid target. Our results suggest that adding bulk to the platinum compound affects reaction with histidine less than with methionine; thus, sufficient bulk may increase the relative number of histidine adducts compared with methionine adducts.

The least-used strategies included humor, self distraction, and substance use. These are ways of avoiding the problem by masking emotions and are rarely used because this group may feel no need to disengage themselves from problems and give up control.

Self-disclosure is the \"act of revealing personal information to others.\" Recent research demonstrated that self-disclosure can reduce uncertainty, impress others, and improve satisfaction. The research question is What kind of strategies of self-disclosure work for building trust in the Hill House neighborhood? I hypothesize that self-disclosure could be an effective communication tool to establish neighborhood relationships. This research involved collecting qualitative data from the residents of the Hill House neighborhood through interviewing. In order to qualify for the research, the interviewees should have lived in the Hill House neighborhood at least one year. This research provides useful information to help the neighbors of the Hill House. (page 9) Zhu, Lin Electrically Controlled Formation and Release of Admicelles for Solid Phase Extraction (Drs. Eric Conte and Stuart Burris) Many toxic or potentially harmful pollutants like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are released into the environment daily. PAHs are determined mainly by chromatographic techniques. However, only a few methods in the parts per trillion (ppt) ranges meet regulatory requirements. The use of admicelles as a preconcentration phase is a relatively new approach for the preconcentration and subsequent determination of chemical substances. An electrically controlled method based on admicelle formation on a solid gold surface using SDS was carried out to preconcentrate PAHs. In this technique, the adsorbed SDS forms one monolayer on a polycrystalline gold substrate by simple electrostatics as the primary driving force. PAHs are attracted to the admicelles, and then the PAH-surfactant association is released on the gold surface.

The CANDELS Program will utilize the Hubble Space Telescope to find these supernovae at unprecedented distances. Our role is to examine these images in real time using astronomical tools to find rising and 60 declining Type Ia supernovae in the early universe. If an object is found in the later filtered images and not in the initial \"template\" image, then the object is a likely supernova candidate, and one of particular interest. Conversely, if an object is found in the initial template image and not in the later filtered images, then it still could be a supernova, but is of slightly less interest as it is already on the decline. The strongest supernova candidates we find will ultimately be observed by the Hubble Space Telescope for further follow-up observations. (page 22) "}
