Cochrane copy-editors use this Style Manual to apply the Cochrane journal style when working on protocols and reviews before publication. Cochrane Style Manual Basics is a summary of the main style points. The Cochrane Style Manual was released as an online resource in July 2016. Suggestions for additions or changes can be submitted via Cochrane Ideas . To see what's changed since the previous version (Cochrane Style Guide V4.1) see What's new . Abbreviations and acronyms In this section: When to use abbreviations and acronyms In this section: General usage | In titles or headings | At the beginning of a sentence | In tables or figures General usage Use abbreviations and acronyms sparingly. Only use abbreviations and acronyms if they are widely known across the broad readership of Cochrane Reviews, are used frequently in a section or throughout the review, or enhance readability. Consider using an abbreviation only if the term has three or more words. All abbreviations and acronyms used in the 'Abstract', 'Plain language summary', 'Main text', and 'Authors' conclusions' should be redefined at the beginning of these sections. In figures and tables, all abbreviations should be listed at the end with their definitions. If the review or document is long, it may be sensible to explain each abbreviation in each section of the text. To use an abbreviation or acronym, write the full name in the first instance and follow it immediately by the abbreviated version or acronym in brackets. When something is better known by its abbreviation or acronym, it may be helpful to include the abbreviation even if the name occurs only once (e.g. World Health Organization (WHO)). Abbreviations and acronyms should follow formatting conventions . Some terms, particularly statistical terms, are commonly abbreviated in Cochrane documents (see Common abbreviations ), while others should be avoided (see Abbreviations to avoid ). See also Frequently used names for names commonly used and abbreviated in Cochrane documents. In titles or headings Page 3/101Only the common abbreviations that do not need to be defined may be used in review titles and headings without the full name needing to be written first. When a term used in a title may be more commonly known under its abbreviated form, its abbreviation may be added in parentheses after the fully written term (e.g. 'A study of the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations for hygiene'). Abbreviations and acronyms are acceptable in headings if they have been defined previously, though it may be preferrable to rearrange the wording of headings to avoid starting with abbreviations. At the beginning of a sentence While it is acceptable to use abbreviations and acronyms at the beginning of a sentence, authors may find it preferable to rephrase sentences to avoid starting with abbreviations. In tables and figures It is convenient to abbreviate some words, such as number (no.) and versus (vs), in tables and figures, but it is preferable to write them in full in the review text. Common abbreviations In this section: Commonly used abbreviations | Common abbreviations that do not need to be defined | Acronyms used within Cochrane | e.g., etc., and i.e. Commonly used abbreviations This table lists some abbreviations commonly used in Cochrane Reviews. See also Common abbreviations that do not need to be defined and Frequently used names .

In Cochrane Reviews, you should use 'e.g.' without following it with a comma. etc.: always write 'etc.' (followed by a full stop) in Cochrane Reviews. Use a comma before 'etc.' if it follows more than one item in a list. i.e.: an abbreviation for 'that is' from the Latin ' id est ' that should only be used for lists within the text or in tables where 'that is' is inappropriate. In Cochrane Reviews, you should use 'i.e.' without following it with a comma.

Term Abbreviation chemical names Hg for mercury (although may be used as part of a unit, for example, 'mmHg') week wk weight wt Latin qds, qid, tds, tid) should not be used. Doses should always be written in full and in English throughout the text and tables. Cochrane Review specific In this section: Cochrane Review: content, structure, and format For guidance on the content, structure, and format of Cochrane Reviews see: Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Page 7/101Methodological Expectations of Cochrane Intervention Reviews (MECIR) MECIR standards for the reporting of new Cochrane Intervention Reviews Titles of Cochrane Reviews Titles for all types of Cochrane Reviews should be in sentence case. Avoid the use of abbreviations (except for those listed as common abbreviations that do not need to be defined , see Abbreviations and acronyms ), and avoid superfluous 'effects of', 'comparison of', 'a systematic review of'). Titles can include italics (see section on Character formatting ) but no other formatting. Titles do not have a full-stop at the end. Guidance on the structure of titles for Cochrane Reviews of interventions is included in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions . Author contact details The Cochrane format for entering the contact details for all authors in Cochrane Reviews is outlined below. A consistent format helps ensure that there is only one record per person entered in Archie , Cochrane's central server for managing reviews and contact details. Entering author contact details in Archie Note: formats for email addresses, international telephone/fax numbers, and web addresses are based on the Telecommunication Standardization Sector of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) Recommendation E.123: Notation for national and international telephone numbers, e- mail addresses and web addresses (02/2001). Contact detail Guidance Correct Incorrect Name: prefix and suffix Select correct prefix from drop-down menu. Use open punctuation in suffix field, i.e. without full stops and with no extra spaces.PhD Ph.D Use 'Dr' or 'MD'; 'Dr' or 'PhD'.Dr Jones Mr Jones, MD Dr Jones Mr Jones, PhDDr Jones, MD Dr Jones, MD Dr Jones, PhD Dr Jones, PhD Page 8/101Contact detail Guidance Correct Incorrect Name: first name and family nameMandatory for all authorsJohn Smith J Smith Name: middle initials Avoid punctuation and use initials only.David RA Jones David R.A.

Abstracts must be no more than 1000 words long, and it is highly desirable for abstracts to be less than 700 words. Plain language summaries Information about the required structure and content of plain language summaries is provided in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions . Headings In this section: Headings in Cochrane Review Headings in Cochrane tables Headings in Cochrane Review text Some predefined headings are automatically included in the review and cannot be removed or altered (e.g. 'Background'). The formats of the different heading levels are shown below in Heading levels available in Review Manager 5 . Some sections of Review Manager (RevMan) 5, such as 'Data collection and analysis', have predefined subheadings that authors can choose to use in those sections (optional subheadings). These can be activated or deactivated manually; for example, 'Selection of studies' can be activated under 'Data collection and analysis'. Page 10/101Predefined headings should be used where appropriate (rather than free-text equivalents), and any headings that are not predefined need to be styled using the drop-down heading styles (see Heading levels available in Review Manager 5 ). The headings in reviews that are being updated should be adjusted to meet this format if they do not comply with it initially (this will ensure that the rendering of the reviews on the Cochrane Library looks good, and is consistent within and across reviews). Authors can also insert author-defined headings (i.e. not one of the predefined subheadings). These headings should use sentence case (i.e. only the first letter of the first word in upper-case) and the section text should start on the next line. The next available heading style from the pull-down list in the tool bar should be applied to the heading; for example, Heading level 1 is used for 'Background', and users would then apply Heading level 2 for the first author-defined subheading used in this section. There is no need to insert a blank line between a heading and a subheading because the software automatically inserts a space. Heading levels available in Review Manager 5 Heading level Example Fixed or optional 1MethodsFixed (e.g. 'Background', 'Methods') 2 Criteria for considering studies for this reviewFixed (e.g. 'Criteria for considering studies for this review') or Optional (e.g. 'Description of the condition') 3 Types of outcome measuresFixed (e.g. 'Types of studies') or Optional (e.g. 'Searching other resources') 4 Primary outcomes Optional (e.g. 'Primary Optional (user-defined) 6Heading 6Optional (user-defined) Headings in Cochrane Review tables See Tables Tense Write things you plan on doing in the future tense (such as in a protocol for a Cochrane Review) and Page 11/101things you have already done in the past tense (such as in a Cochrane Review). In reviews in which few or no trials are included, where not all the methods outlined in the protocol could be used, use the conditional in as simple a form as possible to make it clear what was planned but not executed. Search methods In this section: Citing databases and study registers | Search terms Citing databases and study registers The preferred format for the following databases is all upper-case letters: MEDLINE, CENTRAL, OLDMEDLINE, and CINAHL (not CIN HAL). A number of databases use a mixture of lower-case and upper-case for Embase hINFO). Each Cochrane Review Group is responsible for preparing a register of studies in their area of expertise. The name of the register may vary, but it will follow one of the following formats depending on the Cochrane Review Group's choice: [Cochrane Group name] Trials Register. The databases and trials registers and other resources that are searched for studies for a Cochrane Review are listed the 'Search methods for identification of studies' (in the 'Methods' section). The databases and registers must be listed in the following order: [Cochrane Group name] Specialised Register (or Specialized Register or Trials Register), CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and any other databases. (In the Abstract , brief text may be used to describe the sources searched, e.g. 'CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases and three trials registers were searched in (month year)'.) In the Search Methods section, the date of the latest search (day month year) should be provided along with the issue or version number (as appropriate) of each database, e.g. CENTRAL (year, issue number). The date of inception of the database should be given where known. Database names should include the platform or provider name, and websites should include the full name and URL. The date range (for databases) or search date (for study registers) of each search must be listed with each database; for example, CENTRAL (year, issue number), and for most other databases, such as MEDLINE, it should be in the form 'MEDLINE (year to day month year)'. Example: Cochrane Wounds Specialized Register (searched 10 February 2015) Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 1) in the Cochrane Library (searched 10 February 2015); Page 12/101MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 10 February 2015); Embase Ovid (1974 to 9 February 2015); CINAHL EBSCO (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature; 1982 to 9 February 2015); PsycINFO Ovid (from 1806 to 10 February 2015); AMED Ovid (Allied and Complementary Medicine; from 1985 to 10 February 2015); LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database; from 1982 to 10 February 2015); ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com; searched 10 February 2015); US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov; searched 10 February 2015); Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (www.anzctr.org.au; searched 10 February 2015); World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (apps.who.int/trialsearch; searched 10 February 2015); EU Clinical Trials Register (www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu; searched 10 February 2015). Other formatting options for MEDLINE and Embase: MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to November week 3 2015) Embase Ovid (1974 to 2015 week 47) Search terms Search terms consist of text words (preferred spelling is two words, not 'textword') and indexing or controlled vocabulary terms. The preferred format for referring to the National Library of Medicine's controlled vocabulary used for indexing articles for MEDLINE (and PubMed) is MeSH ( not MESH).

Cochrane Review software Information on how to cite Review Manager (RevMan) and other software is available in the References section. Page 13/101Formatting In this section: Character formatting In this section: General guidance | Bold | Italic | Underline | Subscript and superscript General guidance Seven character formatting styles are available for use in the text in Review Manager (RevMan): regular, bold styles other than 'regular' for emphasis; instead, use an alternative sentence structure or intensify the adjectives and adverbs to achieve this. Bold Bold may be used to indicate letters used to form an acronym or abbreviation (see Abbreviations and acronyms ). Italic Italic may be applied to titles and subtitles of books and journals, and genus and species names. There are also situations in which to avoid using italic; for example, non-English words that have become naturalised into English (these should be in 'regular' style). Punctuation around any text in italic, such as quotation marks, semicolons, and colons, should be in 'regular' style. Correct Incorrect Titles of books and journals in the text of reviewsWe looked through Brain Injury . Note: 'The' should have an initial capital and be in italic if it forms part of the title (e.g. we looked through The Lancet ).We looked through Brain Injury. We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for a particular review. Note: among the Cochrane Library databases, only Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews is italicized.We searched The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for a particular review. Page 14/101Genus and species names Plasmodium falciparum Staphylococcus aureus Note: the genus name starts with an upper-case letter, and the species name is all lower case. Note: once an organism's name has been mentioned in full, use the abbreviated form, e.g. P falciparum , S aureus . Note: for more information see Virus names .Plasmodium falciparum P. falciparum Staphylococcus Aureus S. Aureus Words naturalised into the English languagein vitro in vivo a priori et alin vitro in vivo a priori et al Underline Avoid underlining words. Underlined text can be confused with internet links. Subscript and superscript Subscript and superscript have specific uses. Some examples are displayed below. Correct Incorrect Subscript Member of chemical Page 15/101 Indentation Indentation of text is not supported in Cochrane Reviews. Bulleted and ordered lists can be used to create hierarchies (nested lists); see Bulleted and ordered lists . Ligatures Avoid using ligatures (i.e. joining two or more characters in a single character). Examples include: , \u00e6, fl, and \u00df. Ligatures disrupt automated spellchecking and cause problems with the display of published articles. Lists In this section: General guidance | Lists within paragraphs | Bulleted and ordered lists General guidance There are different ways of formatting lists. The choice of format should be based on the clearest way to display the information. Lists may form parts of sentences within paragraphs , or different levels within a list may be differentiated using bullet points (bulleted lists), or numbers with or without letters (ordered lists). In general, the choice of formatting (i.e. bulleted or ordered lists) and numbering should be consistent within a single document. Within paragraphs Guidance Example Separate each item with a comma. Note: the comma or semicolon before the 'and' is optional (see Punctuation ).Risk factors include a previous history of macrosomia, maternal obesity, maternal weight gain during pregnancy, multiparity, and male fetus. In complex sentences, such as those including several long phrases, introduce the list with a colon and separate each item with a semicolon. Items in the list should be parallel in form (all nouns or all phrases, etc.).The conference included several topics: preparing a protocol; searching databases and trial registers; and drafting a Methods section. Page 16/101Bulleted and ordered lists Bulleted and ordered lists, in which each item is displayed on a separate line, can be set out in a number of ways. Bulleted and ordered lists can go to three levels within a single list (nested lists), as shown below. Nested lists can be constructed using the indent buttons in Review Manager (RevMan) 5 to adjust the level of list items. Do not attempt to format the list by using spaces to indent the items because the formatting changes during the publication process and the published result may look unsatisfactory. The 'and' before the final item in the list is optional (see Punctuation ). Guidance Example Platform phrase and list items are a single sentence The programme aims to help you: 1.learn about systematic reviews; 2.develop your protocol; and 3.learn how to develop your search strategy. The programme aims to help you: learn about systematic reviews; develop your protocol; and learn how to develop your search strategy. Platform phrase with a full stop before starting the list The programme aims to help you with the following. 1.Learn about systematic reviews. 2.Develop your protocol. 3.Learn how to develop your search strategy. The programme aims to help you with the following. Learn about systematic reviews. Develop your protocol. Learn how to develop your search strategy. Independent list with no platform phrase Nested lists can be constructed using the indent buttons in RevMan 5 to adjust the level of list items.1.Australia (country) 1.South Australia (state) i.

Participant health-related quality of life/health status : measured using a standardised generic questionnaire such as EQ-5D, SF-36, SF-12 or SF-6. We did not include ad hoc measures of quality of life that were not likely to be validated and would not be common to multiple trials. Wound infection : as defined by author. Mean pain scores : we included this information only where the data were reported as either a presence or absence of pain, or as a continuous outcome using Page 18/101a validated scale such as a visual analogue scale. Resource use : including measurements such as number of dressing changes, nurse visits, length of hospital stay, readmission and reoperation/intervention. Costs : any costs applied to resource use. Wound recurrence : as defined by study author. Paragraph break Review Manager (RevMan) 5 automatically creates a new paragraph when the 'Enter' or 'Return' key is pressed once. (Unlike in RevMan 4, there is no need to include a blank line between paragraphs.) The spacing between paragraphs in RevMan 5 cannot be modified. Soft returns (i.e. holding the 'Shift' key when pressing 'Enter') are recommended in footnotes. Symbols and special characters In this section: Selecting and adding symbols and special characters | Guidance on spacing around commonly used symbols Selecting and adding symbols and special characters Many different symbols and special characters are available for use in Review Manager (RevMan) 5; they may be inserted using the 'Insert symbol...' option from the 'Edit' menu ( Figure 1 ). Only symbols and special characters available in RevMan can be used in a Cochrane Review. Page 19/101Guidance on spacing around commonly used symbols Symbol Description Spacing + plus, and One space either side minus Note: the minus symbol is different to the dash available on most keyboards. The minus sign is available as a symbol in Review Manager 5 (Unicode 2212).One space either side in mathematical equations, but no space between the minus sign and the number for a negative number e.g. Standard negative pressure rates range from 50 mmHg to 125 mmHg. Note: for equations, see Statistical and mathematical presentation . / per or divided by Use '/' instead of 'per' whereNo space on either side, e.g. 10 g/L Page 20/101Symbol Description Spacing 'per' is otherwise cumbersome 10 mg/kg (not 10 mg per kg) < less than (e.g. for percentages) fewer than (e.g. for people)One space either side > greater than more thanOne space either side = equals One space either side & ampersand Note: only use if part of a recognized trade name e.g. Procter & Gamble Note: retain where it is used in an official journal title e.g. Journal of Pain & Palliative Care Pharmacotherapy e.g. Annals of Nutrition & MetabolismOne space either side % The percentage sign can be used in a block of text when it is used with a numeral. e.g. Fewer than 90% of the participants completed the study. Use 'per cent' instead of '%' when starting a sentence and when the number is written in full (i.e. not a numeral). e.g. Three per cent of people . . .There is no space between the number and the percentage sign, e.g. 15%. , \u00ae The trademark symbols (\u00ae for registered; for unregistered) are not normally used inIf used, the symbols should be written immediately after the brand name they apply to, with Page 21/101Symbol Description Spacing Cochrane Reviews. See Pharmaceutical drug names .no separating space, e.g. Nexium\u00ae, Backup Exec software. Grammar and writing style In this section: Active and passive voice Traditionally the passive voice has been used by scientists and medical professionals on the basis that what happened was considered to be more important than who did it. However, use of the passive has declined, and Cochrane Reviews should use the active voice where possible, as it is generally more accessible and a clearer way of defining responsibilities and relationships. Active voice Passive voice Two authors extracted data. Data were extracted by two authors. The editor will provide feedback. Feedback will be provided by the editor. Most sentences need to be written in the active voice. In situations where the identity of the subject is not important, and where the focus of the message is paramount, it is appropriate to use a passive construction. For example: 'The vitreous, retina and other internal structures in the eye can be viewed through a specialized microscope.' Adjectives as nouns Avoid using adjectives as nouns when they are not used as nouns by a general readership. A statement such as 'There is growing evidence of the impact of overweight on the incidence of diabetes' could be changed to 'There is growing evidence of the impact of being overweight on the incidence of diabetes'. And/or Avoid using 'and/or' as it is not explicit. Try rephrasing the sentence; for example, 'fever and/or headache ...' to 'fever or headache, or both ...'. 'And/or' may be acceptable where rephrasing would Page 22/101make the reading cumbersome; for example, 'fever and/or headache and/or nausea ...'. Compared to/compared with There are different views about the usage and specific meanings of 'compared with' and 'compared to', but they may be used interchangeably in Cochrane Reviews.

Hyphen Hyphens are used to link two or more word compounds used as adjectives, such as 'six-week interval' and 'four-dose regimen'. Be aware that hyphens can sometimes change the meaning of a word, such as 'unionised' (with a union) and 'un-ionised' (without ions).There was a six-week interval between doses.

Simple and accessible English In this section: General guidance | Words and expressions to avoid | PLEACS | Additional resources General guidance Cochrane Reviews should be written in clear, simple English so that they can be understood by the broad and international readership of Cochrane. Simplicity and clarity are vital to readability . Complex or ambiguous expressions should be avoided or reformulated to promote readability (see examples below). Where a simple English phrase can be used, do not use non-English expressions. Words and expressions to avoid This table lists selected examples of complex expressions to avoid, and acceptable reformulations Avoid Preferred herein in the majority of most in the majority of instances usually ab initio from the start as per according to per e.g. Results not reported per intervention groupby e.g. Results not reported by intervention group There has been a close to two-fold increase in the incidence of infection.The number of infections nearly doubled. not only do also in the vast majority of the trials in most of the trials There was a loss of participants, with the main reason being death of the patient.There was a loss of participants mainly due to deaths. Page 27/101There were eight studies that compared different types of antibiotics.Eight studies compared different types of antibiotics. PLEACS Plain language summaries fulfil an important function in Cochrane Reviews. Aimed at a broad readership, they convey the review question and the findings in terms that are accessible to consumers and non-expert readers. The Plain Language Expectations for Authors of Cochrane Summaries (PLEACS) initiative provides guidance about writing simple, accessible English. See Standards for the reporting of Plain Language Summaries in new Cochrane Intervention Reviews (PLEACS) . Additional resources The following sections of the Style Manual provide further guidance on ways to promote simple and accessible English: Active and passive voice Adjectives as nouns Tautology Verbs: single or plural In addition, many other resources provide examples of how to restructure sentences that may help authors promote plain English and improve readability. Examples include the Plain English Campaign or Wikipedia's list of plain English words or phrases . Tautology Avoid tautology, that is \"the saying of the same thing twice over in different words\" ( The New Oxford Dictionary of English , 1998). Examples of tautology Tautology No tautology We excluded trials of children with a history of headaches in the past .We excluded trials of children with a history of headaches.

Statistical heterogeneity was described by Chi2 6.41; P value 0.27; I2 indicating 6.41; Tense . Upper-case letters Only use upper-case letters if there is a compelling reason not to use lower-case letters (e.g. when a word is a proper noun). Verbs: single or plural Group nouns can use either a single or plural form of the verb, but the choice should be consistent within each Cochrane Review or document; for example, 'the government has ...' or 'the government have ...'. In Cochrane Reviews, 'data' should always be treated as a plural noun, taking a plural verb (e.g. 'the data are ...', not 'the data is ...'). There is some debate about whether data can take the singular form of the verb when it is referring to a body of information rather than the actual numbers. In those cases, consider using an alternate word, such as 'information' or 'findings'. 'Errata', 'media', 'strata', and 'criteria' are plural nouns and take plural verbs. The singular forms of these words are 'erratum', 'medium', 'stratum', and 'criterion', which take singular verbs. International considerations In this section: Country names In this section: General guidance | Specific examples | Abbreviations | Further resources Page 29/101General guidance In general, for countries with complex names use contemporary English terms and an accepted short form rather than the full name (e.g. 'United Kingdom' or 'UK' rather than 'United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'). When reporting the country or region of a study, use the terminology used in the studies and, if possible, place it in contemporary context, being sure to reflect changes in borders and names accurately (e.g. 'the study was conducted in Yugoslavia (i.e. Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia, Macedonia and Montenegro at the time of writing; YYYY)' or 'the study was conducted in the Czech Republic (part of Czechoslovakia at the time of the study; YYYY)' if you know that the studies were conducted in that region). Specific examples The Netherlands : use 'the Netherlands' in running text but 'The Netherlands' at the start of headings or sentences. USA : use 'USA' or 'the USA' (as appropriate) in running text when referring to the United States of America; other forms may be used when part of specific names, e.g. the 'US Drug and Food Administration'. Abbreviations For more information on abbreviations of country names, see Common abbreviations that do not need to be defined . Further resources These resources may be helpful: World Bank: Countries Wikipedia: List of sovereign states UK Government Permanent Committee on Geographical Names: Country names Currency Express currency as the currency abbreviation and amount (e.g. EUR 250, USD 50) using the recommended three-letter currency abbreviations ( ISO 4217 ). English language: regional differences Page 30/101There are regional differences in the English language, and Cochrane Review Groups support both British (i.e. UK) and American (i.e. US) English. Cochrane Reviews should use one type of English throughout. The '-ize' suffix (e.g. randomize) is often associated with US English and '-ise' (e.g. randomise) with British English, when in fact '-ize' is also commonly used in British English. Cochrane Reviews can use either spelling but the choice should be applied consistently within a single Cochrane Review or document. Note that the Cochrane brand guidelines state a preference for UK English with '-ize' spelling. Ethnic group names When reporting the ethnicity of participants in studies, use the terminology used in the studies. If the terminology is obviously inaccurate or inappropriate, first mention the terminology used in the study, and follow it by the correct terminology in parentheses (e.g. 'The study included 843 Caucasian participants (understood to be white participants)'). When mentioning ethnic groups in other sections of the review use an acceptable contemporary term. There is no simple consensus on names, so where possible use precise descriptions rather than catch-all terms, being sure to distinguish between ethnicity and nationality (e.g. Croats versus Croatians).

Page (in 'Roger RG 3rd' Some family names have specific formatting, and there may be regional differences. For consistency, in the text Chinese names should follow a Westernized style, that is, first name followed by the family name: first name/personal name ( m\u00edngzi) and family name/surname ( x\u00ecng). Formatting of Dutch family names should follow the style from the table below. It is advisable to seek confirmation from Cochrane authors before modifying. General guidance on Dutch family names in the text Note: also see additional information in the reference section. First name (or initial) before the family namevan, de, der, and ter start with a lower-case letter'Danielle van der Windt' or 'DA van der Windt' Only family name used Van, De, Der, and Ter start with an upper-case letter'Van der Windt' Pharmaceutical drug names Refer to pharmaceutical drugs using the Recommended International Nonproprietary Name (generic name; rINN; see note below), rather than the brand name. This system helps avoid confusion where common names for drugs differ around the world; for example, acetaminophen is commonly used in the USA, but it is more commonly known as paracetamol (also the rINN) in the UK. If needed, however, place the brand name in brackets after the rINN. A rINN should start with a lower-case letter, while a brand name starts with an upper-case letter. For example, the rINN for one type of antibiotic is 'ciprofloxacin'. This could be presented as 'ciprofloxacin' alone or 'ciprofloxacin (Ciproxin)' if essential, but not as 'Ciproxin' alone. Useful resources for locating or checking the rINN are the British National Formulary (which provides information on medicines prescribed in the UK), the WHO MedNet (which can be accessed for free upon registration), and the WHO Model Formulary (which provides comprehensive information on medicines in the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines). Note: \"International Nonproprietary Names (INN) facilitate the identification of pharmaceutical Page 41/101substances or active pharmaceutical ingredients. Each INN is a unique name that is globally recognized and is public property. A nonproprietary name is also known as a generic name.\" World Health Organization, Essential Drugs and Medicine Policy, International Nonproprietary Names. www.who.int/medicines/services/inn/en/ (accessed 7 July 2015). There is no need to use trademark symbols (\u00ae or ) with brand names. These symbols (\u00ae for registered; for unregistered) are intended for use by owners of brand names to assert their ownership in their own documentation and advertising. There is no need to use these symbols with drug or product names in Cochrane Reviews, but brand names should always have an initial capital letter and correct spelling. If there is potential misunderstanding or ambiguity about the status of a name, the text should make it clear that it is a brand name, with the company name added if needed. Organism names Names of organisms are given in the form Genus species (e.g. Plasmodium falciparum , Staphylococcus aureus ). The genus name starts with an upper-case letter, and the species name is all lower case. Both are italicised. Once an organism's name has been stated in full, use the abbreviated form thereafter. For the abbreviated form use the initial letter of the genus followed by the species name (e.g. P falciparum , S aureus ). Virus names Virus names in Cochrane Reviews should follow the rules of orthography of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). The table summarises how to format virus names, but refer to ictvonline.org/virusorthography.asp for a full overview of ICTV recommendations. Formatting of virus names Note: this information comes from http://ictvonline.org/virusorthography.asp where there are further examples of formatting rules and a full taxonomy index. Type of term Formatting Examples Virus order, family, subfamily, or genusItalics with first letter of the name capitalisedMononegavirales (order) Picornaviridae (family) Parvovirinae (subfamily) Hepacivirus (genus) Species name Italics with the first letter of the first name capitalised.

Numbers, statistics, and units In this section: Dates In this section: Standard date format | Regional considerations | Decades and centuries | Examples of formatting dates and time periods Standard date format Cochrane documents always use this format and sequence for dates: day (numeral) month (always in full) year (four-digit numeral) No additional punctuation or suffixes should be used. Regional considerations There are regional differences in the ways dates are expressed. Always use the standard format in Cochrane documents. Be careful when referring to seasons, as they occur at different times of the year in different parts of the world. Decades and centuries Decades are always expressed as numerals, and century numbers may be expressed as numerals or written in full (e.g. '19th century' or 'nineteenth century'). Examples of formatting of dates and time periods Note: the date formats in the examples below are for use in the text of Cochrane documents.

The full list of SI units and further information is available from the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) and the NIST Reference on Constants, Units, and Uncertainty . Unit name Symbol Type kilogram kg base unit microgram \u00b5g base unit metre m base unit second (unit of time) s base unit cubic metre m3derived unit degree Celsius \u00b0C derived unit metre per second m/s derived unit square metre m2derived unit day d non-SI unit degree \u00b0 non-SI unit hour h non-SI unit litre Note: the BIPM adopted the symbol 'l' 1879; it then adopted the alternative 'L' inL non-SI unit Page 50/101Unit name Symbol Type 1979 in order to avoid the risk of confusion between the letter 'l' and the number '1'. minute (unit of time) min non-SI unit minute (measurement of angle) ' non-SI unit second (measurement of angle) \" non-SI unit Prefixes for SI units This table includes the SI prefixes commonly used in Cochrane Reviews. Factor Name and symbol Example 10-1deci (d) decilitre (where 'litre' is the base unit) 10-2centi (c) centimetre (where 'metre' is the base unit) 10-3milli (m) milligram \u00b5) microlitre 10-9nano (n) nanogram General guidance on SI units SI units and their derivatives should follow the style conventions listed below. Unlike most abbreviations and acronyms , it is not necessary to define the full unit name on first use. These are a selection of style conventions from NIST and BIPM (see links above). Cochrane Reviews may deviate from some of the style conventions due to the nature of Cochrane Review production; for example, Cochrane Reviews use commas to separate digits into groups of three (e.g. 150,739) instead of thin, fixed spaces (150 739). Guidance Correct Incorrect Unit symbols are unaltered when plural10 mg 10 mgs Page 51/101Guidance Correct Incorrect Unit symbols are not followed by a full stop, except when followed by normal sentence punctuationI added 60 \u00b5g of salt. I added 60 \u00b5g. of salt. The unit symbol to which a numerical value belongs, and the mathematical operation that applies to the value of a quantity, should be clear.20 \u00b0C to 30 \u00b0C 123 g \u00b1 \u00b0C 20 to 30 \u00b0C 123 \u00b1 2 g (123 \u00b1 2) g Values of quantities: use Arabic numerals plus symbols for unitsm = 5 kg the current was 15 Am = five kilograms m = five kg the current was 15 amperes Put one space between the numerical value and the unit symbol. Do not put a space between a prefix and the unit symbol. Note: except in the case of superscript units for angles or degrees (e.g. 2\u00b0 3').2 s 25 nL2s 25 n L When a value with unit is used as a modifier before a noun, write out the name of the metric quantity and use a hyphen between the numeral and unit.a 2-second delay a 20-liter containera 2-s delay a 20 L container Do not mix information with unit symbols or namesthe water content is 20 mL/kg 20 mL H2O/kg 20 mL of water/kg Informal references to non-SI units, such as a historical quotes using inches, are acceptable depending on the context.It took five hours to travel 10 miles in 1945.It took five hours to travel 10 miles (16.09 km) in 1945. References Page 52/101In this section: Entering and citing references in Cochrane Reviews In this section: References in Cochrane Reviews References are divided into two groups: 1) references to studies; and 2) other references. The references to studies comprise included, excluded, and ongoing studies, as well as studies awaiting classification. The other references comprise additional references (e.g. those used in the background or discussion sections) and references to other published versions of the review (including the protocol). Each study has a Study ID (usually made up of the last name of the first author plus the year) used to refer and link to the study within the review. Each study has one or more references. Other references have Reference IDs (usually made up of the last name of the first author plus the year). Entering references In this section: Reference fields | Reference types Reference fields When references are entered manually in Review Manager (RevMan), different reference fields need to be completed (e.g. author(s), title, journal, page numbers etc.). For guidance on content and presentation of the different reference fields, see the Reference fields section. Note that text formatting is applied to references entered in RevMan during the publishing process; for example, journal titles and book titles are converted to italic text on publication. Reference types References can be typed in manually or imported from files generated by standard bibliographic software (see RevMan 5 User Guide ) or from the Cochrane Register of Studies. It is preferable to use the importing method. Different types of references can be entered into RevMan 5. See Overview of reference types . For detailed examples of reference types and how to populate reference fields, see the Reference types section. If a reference does not fit into one of the available categories, select 'Other' and use the available fields in a way that gives an appropriately formatted reference. You can also refer to Citing Medicine , the National Library of Medicine's guide for citing references, for other reference types, such as a patents, legal material, or journal articles with a retraction, comment, or erratum. See also Page 53/101Differences between Cochrane and NLM style . Citing references This table provides guidance on inserting references in the text in Cochrane Reviews. The study and reference IDs must be linked to the reference list. Guidance Correct Incorrect Separate multiple citations with a semicolon.(Smith 2000; Robb 2001) (Smith 2000, Robb 2001) List in alphabetical or chronological order (from earliest to latest), and be consistent within a single document.Alphabetical : 1988; and Slinn 2001) Citations can be used as part of a sentence or placed in round brackets within the closest punctuation.

Reference fields References need to be entered into Review Manager (RevMan) using the designated fields (see Figure 1). Different reference types, such as journal articles and books, need information in different fields. The table below has guidance on the correct way of entering information into the various reference fields in RevMan. RevMan automatically inserts punctuation at the appropriate locations in the formatted reference, so ensure that there is no full stop at the end of each reference field.

Report No.: NIH-NHLI-69-2185-4 Differences between Cochrane and NLM style In this section: Overview | Reference types | Reference fields | Formatting differences | Useful sections in Citing Medicine Overview The US National Library of Medicine (NLM)'s Citing Medicine is a useful resource that covers a wide range of referencing specificities. It is largely compatible with Cochrane style. For certain reference types , reference fields , and formatting details , Cochrane style differs from Citing Medicine , and authors should stick to recommendations in the Cochrane Style Manual. These differences are listed below. There are some useful sections in Citing Medicine that may be helpful for handling non-standard Page 85/101reference types or other aspects not specified by the Cochrane Style Manual. Reference types Reference types for which authors should follow the Cochrane Style Manual regardless of recommendations from Citing Medicine : Cochrane documents; letters, emails, and personal communication; computer programs; ongoing studies; publications on the Internet. Reference fields This table gives details of reference fields for which authors should follow Cochrane Style Manual regardless of recommendations from Citing Medicine . Cochrane Style Manual (correct)Citing Medicine (incorrect) Authors Only the first six should be listed, and followed by 'et al' as described in Reference fields . Note: when entering information in the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS), it is preferable to enter as many authors as possible.Citing Medicine asks for all authors to be listed. Date of publication When entering a date in Review Manager (RevMan), include only the year of publication for most references types. Note: except for conference proceedings event dates, newspaper articles, websites, and correspondence. Note: when entering references in the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS), month - and even day of publication - can be entered when available.Citing Medicine recommends including the month and day of the publication date. Page 86/101In Cochrane Reviews and protocols, only write '(in press)' without writing the expected date of publication.When a study is in press, Citing Medicine recommends writing the publication date as 'forthcoming YYYY' where YYYY is the year of expected publication. If the article is an electronic publication ahead of print, add the date of electronic publication followed by '[Epub ahead of print]. If the article is now fully published, do not add '[Epub ahead of print]' and simply enter the year the article was published.For publications that are published, but were available online before publication (i.e. electronic publication (Epub)), Citing Medicine recommends writing both the date of electronic publication and the full date of publication. City and country of publicationWrite country names in full, except for countries listed in the table Common abbreviations that do not need to be defined (i.e. UK, USA).Citing Medicine permits country names to be written in full (e.g. Germany), or international abbreviations to be used (e.g. DE). Journal names Journal names should always be written in full and selected from the journal pick list.Citing Medicine asks for journal names to be written in the abbreviated form (e.g. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA). Formatting differences There are some differences between the styles of Cochrane and Citing Medicine , due to software limitations, or to promote consistency across different reference types.

Dates cross months Tables and figures In this section: Tables In this section: Types of tables | Formatting : cell alignment | Width and height | Title | Column headings | Row headings | Table body | Footnotes : examples ; positioning Page 89/101Additional guidance on how to present text in tables in Cochrane Reviews is in development and will be added to this section at a later date. Types of tables in Review Manager 5 There are five types of table available in Review Manager (RevMan) 5. Table Description Permitted formatting Footnotes permitted? Tables in main text Used for presenting limited amounts information in tabular format within the main body of textSame as available within main text plus heading cells, cell alignment, and cell mergeNo 'Characteristics of studies' tablesUsed for recording the characteristics of studies that are included, excluded, awaiting classification, or ongoing. Each type of study has a number of predefined attributes (methods, participants, interventions, outcomes), and users can include additional attributes.Same as available within main textYes 'Risk of bias' tables Used for additional characteristics of included studies, such as details of allocation concealment (called 'Assessment of methodological quality tables' in diagnostic available within main textYes 'Summary of findings' tablesCan be generated with GRADEproGDT software and imported into RevManSee Grade Profiler softwareYes Additional tables Used for tables that are too large or not sufficiently important to be in the main bodySame as available within main text plus heading cells, cell alignment, and cellYes Page 90/101Table Description Permitted formatting Footnotes permitted? of text. Each table has a title and can be linked to the main text.merge Formatting options In addition to the formatting that is available within all of the main text, some tables (see Types of tables in Review Manager 5 ) have three further options: heading cells, which applies heading style to the cell (shown as bold in RevMan 5); cell alignment , which allows a choice of horizontal and vertical alignments; and cell merge, which allows adjacent cells to be merged together to create a single cell. Formatting should be consistent within a single table. As with other parts of a Cochrane Review, the visual presentation of tables will change during the publication process; for example, it is important not to use the 'Enter key' within a single block of text (e.g. in a single word if the word runs over two lines) because the text layout will also change during the publication process. Cell alignment examples Width and height The width and height of tables or individual cells cannot be specified. Instead, cells (and thereby row, columns, and tables) expand automatically to fit the content. Table title The title should be concise and reflect the table content. Use sentence case without a full stop at the end. Column headings Column headings should be in sentence case and formatted using 'Toggle heading/cell', which applies heading formatting to the cell. This also applies if there are nested column heads (i.e. two rows of column headings); the top heading in nested column heads is likely to be in a series of merged Page 91/101cells that span the relevant columns. Horizontal alignment: in general, the heading cells should be left aligned. If the table contains nested column heads (see above), then the top row should be centre aligned. Vertical alignment: column headings should be bottom aligned (instead of top or middle aligned). Row headings Tables may or may not have headings for each row. If so, these should be in sentence case and formatted using 'Toggle heading/cell', which applies heading formatting to the cell. Horizontal alignment: the row headings should be left aligned unless there is good reason to do otherwise. Vertical alignment: in general, row headings should be top aligned. Table body Use sentence case if the content is all or mainly text. Use numbers instead of words in tables (see Exceptions to basic rules for numbers and ordered events less than 10 ). Only use full-stops to end blocks of text when the block ends with a full sentence. Horizontal alignment: in general, the body cells should be left aligned. Vertical alignment: vertical alignment of the body cells should be top (instead of middle or bottom). There may be occasions when the cells should be bottom aligned, but this should only be done when it makes sense visually. Blank cells: avoid blank cells in a table. Insert an em-dash or ellipsis if the column heading does not apply to the cell, or use NA (not applicable) or ND (no data available) if a distinction is needed. Remember to explain these two abbreviations in the footnotes. Footnotes Footnotes are a convenient way to define abbreviations and acronyms or display other explanatory notes (see Examples of table footnotes below). Use superscript lower-case letters to denote footnotes. Where a footnote symbol follows punctuation, place the footnote symbol immediately after the punctuation mark unless it is a dash or closing bracket. Where a footnote refers to a specific point within a sentence, place the footnote symbol immediately after the relevant phrase (see Examples of correct and incorrect positioning of footnote symbols below). The placement of the footnote symbol should go from left to right, followed by top to bottom. When a footnote refers to the whole table, such as the source of the table content, the footnote symbol should go at the end of the table title. Page 92/101Each footnote needs to be explained. Repeat the superscript letter immediately under the table and follow it with the explanatory text. There is no space between the superscript letter and the explanatory text. Start each footnote on a new line, and end each footnote with a full stop. Use a soft return between footnotes (i.e. hold the shift key when pressing return). Examples of table footnotes Use a superscript letter for a footnote.aThe order of footnotes should go left to right, followed by top to bottom.b A third footnote could be used here.c\u2014 aUse the same superscript letter in the footnote text below the table. bRemember to finish the footnote with a full stop. cStart each footnote on a new line. Use a soft return (i.e. hold the shift key when pressing return) between new lines. Examples of correct and incorrect positioning of footnote symbols Correct Incorrect The analysis does not include the full study.a The doses were inconsistent (from 0.5 mg to 10 mgb) and reported only once a day.

Use the guidance provided in the Considerations and recommendations for figures in Cochrane reviews: graphs of statistical data and the RevMan 5 User Guide to ensure the published figures are appropriate. Please ensure that any figures you insert in the review are legible and clear and have an appropriate and accurate title. Page 93/101 About this manual In this section: Using the manual Style manuals exist to improve consistency and clarity of text, and to ensure that terminology, names, and usage reflect current best practice and branding. They also work as a repository of decisions on usage, thus reducing duplicated or conflicting decision-making efforts for authors and editors. The Cochrane Style Manual is different from some other style manuals, in that it allows for some flexibility in style, reflecting the distributed nature of Cochrane editorial and author teams, but it also aims to bring unity and a recognizable journal style where there may be unhelpful variation. All Cochrane Reviews and protocols should aim to adhere to the Cochrane Style Manual. The Cochrane Style Manual does not explain how to prepare a Cochrane Review and does not cover every word choice or every context. Authors and editors will need to use their knowledge and judgement when applying the guidance, but any deviation should be for a good reason rather than personal preference. This manual is primarily for use with Cochrane Reviews and associated content, but it may be applicable to other Cochrane content. You should also refer to the Cochrane Brand Guidelines . Revising the manual The Cochrane Style Manual is revised in response to changes within Cochrane or to incorporate new standards. The manual may also be revised in response to suggestions from users or from the Cochrane Style Manual Working Group . Major changes are recorded on the Latest substantive changes page. A log of changes made between 2010 (version 4.1 of the Cochrane Style Guide) and July 2016 (when the Cochrane Style Manual was released in this format) is available at What's new . Suggestions for additions, clarifications or other improvements should be submitted via Cochrane Ideas . Cochrane Ideas is a tool for collecting and prioritizing feedback from Cochrane contributors. Users can post issues or suggestions, and others can vote and comment on these suggestions. On Cochrane Ideas there is a dedicated forum for the Cochrane Style Manual . Once an idea is submitted, it will be visible immediately to other users of the forum, who may vote on the idea. All ideas are reviewed soon after submission and contributors may be asked for clarification. Some suggestions will be implemented quickly, whereas others may need further discussion by the Cochrane Style Manual Working Group or input from subject specialists. Ideas that have merit, but are not seen as priorities, may be left to gather more votes.
