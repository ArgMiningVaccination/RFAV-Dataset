Modern Healing It's no secret that many of us lead busy, stressful lives caring for everybody but ourselves. Society's \"shoulds\" often feel heavy: how you should look, how you should feel, how you should raise your kids, what your relationships should look like...and on and on. These pressures can accumulate in the body, deplete your vitality and lead to physical symptoms related to stress. Energy medicine is one of the quickest, easiest and safest ways to reconnect with your body's needs and effect positive change\u2014physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually. It integrates a wide-range of techniques from ancient traditions that have been recognized for thousands of years, such as Acupuncture, Shamanism, Reiki, Touch for Health and Reflexology. Energy Medicine truly offers us ancient wisdom with a modern approach to healing. We are already seeing the adoption and powerful results of Energy Medicine sitting alongside conventional medicine approaches. Dr. Oz, Director of Cardiovascular Institute of Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, shared, \"The next big frontier in medicine is energy medicine.\" Dr. Oz is not alone in this claim. Norm Shealy, M.D., founding president of the American Holistic Medical Association, also stated, \"Energy Medicine is the future of all medicine.\" If you are interested in improving your quality of life, consider how treating the energies that influence the functions of your organs and body systems can inform you about your life and your ailments. The beauty of energy medicine is that it gives you the opportunity to slow down, connect with the body and your ability to care for yourself, and feel nourished and whole.

Energy healing therapy has been used to treat a wide variety of ailments and health problems, and is often used in conjunction with other alternative and conventional medical treatments.\" \u2014 [The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH)](https://nccih.nih.gov/) 1. The Body Has Energy Systems. Energy is the life force that keeps us alive. Albert Einstein proved this with his famous formula, E=mc2, showing that, \"Everything is energy, and that's all there is to it.\" Our bodies are made up of molecules that are in constant motion (known as Qi or Chi), and this energy has been the focus of many ancient health practices such as acupuncture, acupressure, Qigong and yoga. Two important principles of energy medicine are (1) Energy must move, and (2) Energy moves in patterns. The body has intricate energy systems to allow for optimal movement, and they are deeply connected to our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual health. 2. Energy Systems Can Become \"Out of Balance\". The body's energy is continually being influenced by outside forces: stress, trauma, illness and toxins. The good news is, our energy patterns adapt to our environment and work to support our needs and wellbeing. However, our energy systems suffer when continually exposed to threats, such as stress. When energy pathways become blocked, the flow of energy forms new habits that affect our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual health. To overcome illness and maintain vibrant health, the body needs its energies to move in specific patterns. We can correct the energy flow back through \"re-patterning\" using energy medicine techniques. Re-patterning and restoring balance gives us the ability to address illness, restore health and vibrance, and support our whole selves. 3. ENERGY MEDICINE Restores Balance. Our energies are intelligent. They support us in adapting to various situations, but they also need us to reroute them back to their normal state once certain adaptations aren't needed anymore. As we evolve, we need to regularly cleanse and rebalance energetically so that our bodies can continue to heal itself. There are various traditions that help restore balance of our energy systems, such as Traditional Chinese Medicine, Massage, Acupressure, Chakras, Qi Gong or Yoga. However, most traditions work with just one system. [Eden Energy Medicine](http://www.innersource.net/em/) (developed by Donna Eden) is special because it utilizes 9 ancient energetic systems, all wrapped up into one highly effective modality. These systems are: Aura, Meridians, Five Rhythms, Celtic Weave, Chakras, Grid, Radiant Circuits, Triple Warmer and Electrics. As an Eden Energy Medicine Clinical Practitioner, [Beth Lynch](https://www.rootswingsenergy.com/meet-beth) takes a modern mind-body approach and truly personalize the session to her clients' needs. The techniques involve postures, tapping, gentle laying of hands, and stimulating energy acupressure points. 4. RESTORING BALANCE IS ACCESSIBLE TO ANYONE AT ANYTIME. Eden Energy Medicine gives everyone tools to treat ailments and health problems\u2014not just the practitioner. After each session at Roots & Wings, clients receive a personalized home-care routine that takes 10-minutes or less each day. This empowers clients to tap into their own ability to heal themselves and effect positive change outside of their sessions. Restoring balance is simpler than you may think\u2014it just takes time and intention for the energy to learn its natural state of flow again. Many clients report feeling better after a session or after completing a home-care routine. "}
