Our Philosophy Digging Deeper We are committed to helping you reach your best health by identifying the unique and underlying causes of illness. Conventional medicine often focuses on naming diseases and using a pill for every ill. We take a different approach. Functional Medicine views the body as one integrated system, not a collection of independent organs that should be divided up by medical specialties. To put it simply, we treat the whole system, not just the symptoms. Collaborative Care Our patients are our partners. Our team of practitioners works with each patient to move toward their best health or what we call optimal wellness. The Institute of Natural Health is a one-stop-shop for wellness designed to kickstart healing and a life of vitality. Innovative Testing and Treatments We integrate the best of traditional Western medical practices with innovative Functional Medicine testing and treatments. We recognize that each patient is different and requires a personalized treatment plan. Whether it be IV nutrition, ozone therapy, supplements, prescription medication, therapeutic diets, detox programs, stress management techniques or any of our high-tech therapies, we are committed to using what works for you. Patient Centered We focus on patient-centered care. By listening to you and learning your story, the practitioner brings the patient into the discovery process and tailors treatments that address the individual's unique needs. One size does NOT fit all, and we strive to provide the highest quality individualized care for all of our patients. The Institute of Natural Health is not just about the absence of disease, it is about the presence of vitality and feeling good. Let's work together to create optimal wellness.
