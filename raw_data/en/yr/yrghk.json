The program includes over 40,000 retail locations to help increase accessibility to the vaccines nationwide. The Retail Pharmacy Program launched in early February 2021. See the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website for a list of [participating pharmacies](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/retail-pharmacy-program/participating-pharmacies.html). Vaccine for this program will come out of the federal supply and will be kept separate from our state's weekly allocation. Pharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention created the [Pharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care program](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/long-term-care/pharmacy-partnerships.html), a partnership with CVS and Walgreens to offer on-site COVID-19 vaccines to residents of nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and other community-based, congregate living settings where most individuals over 65 years of age are receiving care, supervision, or assistance. See this [list of resources for new long-term care facility providers](/sites/default/files/legacy/Documents/1600/coronavirus/348-820-InfoForNewLTCFProviders.pdf?uid=65000910bbb0c).

Frequently Asked Questions - Can pharmacies sign up to participate in the Pharmacy Partnership? - Unfortunately, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention isn't currently able to enroll individual pharmacies in this program. However, your pharmacy is welcome to [enroll as a COVID-19 Vaccination Program provider](/emergencies/covid-19/healthcare-providers/vaccine-information-health-care-providers/federal-program-enrollment)in Washington. - Can individuals in long term care facilities get the vaccine if they were already exposed to the virus? - Yes. Long-term care settings have seen frequent outbreaks, so the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends vaccinations begin and continue for staff and residents who are not actively infected. Facilities should continue to limit social gatherings and use appropriate protective equipment. - For residents and patients in long-term care, does my facility have to ask the family before administering a COVID-19 vaccine? - The resident, patient, or individual who has been identified to make medical decisions for the resident or patient must give permission for the vaccine to be administered.
