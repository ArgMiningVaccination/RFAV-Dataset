It focuses on how the mind interacts with the body, and uses both counselling and body therapies to affect the mind and body. The brain does not finish in the head but ranges all through the body. The brain's job is to coordinate and control the body, and to ensure it functions well. Looked at in this way it is hard to know where the brain begins and the body finishes. It is more accurate to see the two as totally interdependent. The brain is dependent on the body for nutrients, fluids, and information. The body is dependent on the brain for control and coordination of function. In Western Medicine increasing attention is being paid to psychophysiology - how the mind and body interact and how they connect to create health and/or disease. Western medicine has proven stress produces disease. It does this by changing cellular and organ function, metabolism and impeding key processes such as digestion. In complementary medicine there are a number of traditions which have linked the mind and body including Homeopathy, Chinese Medicine and the Chakra system for example. In Mind Body Medicine we map symptoms and psychology. We work to connect with ourselves, to take responsibility for our reactions to events and how we live our life in order to embrace wellness and wholeness. We do this using a combination of therapies that affect both the body and mind. Use the body through: - Movement - Touch - Primitive reflexes - Breathing - Felt sense - Kinesiology Use the Mind through: - Visualisation - Imagery - Meditation - "}
