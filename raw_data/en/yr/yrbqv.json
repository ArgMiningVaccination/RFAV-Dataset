Full of energy and stamina, you could tackle massive projects, long work days, and arduous workouts and still have the energy to support your sizzling sex drive. With age, you might feel the same energy you once felt has slowed or waned. A decreased sex drive can be a normal part of aging, but don't worry. You can still enjoy a thriving sex life and support a healthy level of sexual desire and performance by taking care of yourself and adding a few natural remedies to your supplement cocktail. Let's discuss what causes low libido and what herbal remedies are available to help support a low sex drive. We'll cover natural aphrodisiacs used in Ayurvedic medicine for thousands of years and discuss ways to boost libido naturally. It's about to get steamy! Sex After 40 (or 50, or 60) It's no secret that with age, sex hormones change. The out-of-control hormonal urges you experienced as a teen or young adult are no longer coursing through your veins like a potent aphrodisiac. Inside your body, changes are happening. Changes in Men After 40 After age 40, men's testosterone levels begin to decline by as much as 1 percent per year.REF#2547 This can cause physical and mental changes like fatigue, loss of sexual interest, and even sexual dysfunction. It can feel disheartening to feel like you've lost your edge or struggle with stamina. At the same time, your prostate health may change, too. The prostate tends to get larger with age, which may make it difficult to pass urine. Changes in the prostate can lead to erectile dysfunction and sexual health problems.REF#2548 Supporting men's wellness at all ages is essential. Let's now look at how women's health changes with age. Changes in Women After 40 Changes in sexual arousal happen across the board, affecting both men and women. As women approach menopause, levels of estrogen begin to decline.REF#2546Postmenopausal women will produce even less estrogen. Women who have had hysterectomies may also produce less testosterone, which can affect their levels of sexual desire. These changes in hormone levels can create a change in sexual desire and sexual performance \u2014 however, other factors can affect libido over time. Other Factors That Affect Libido Your physiology plays a role in your libido and your ability to experience sexual pleasure. Certain medications and lifestyle factors can also affect libido. This isn't an exhaustive list of reasons why you might not feel interested in sex as you once were, but we've rounded up some common possibilities. These reasons may include: - Relationship tension REF#2550 - Certain medications, like antidepressants and hormonal birth control REF#2550 - Alcohol misuse REF#2550 - Being inactive REF#2550 - Having a BMI that falls within the obese range REF#2550 If you suspect one of these to be the issue, speaking to a therapist or healthcare provider may be a good next step. In addition to a treatment plan, you can talk to them about taking herbal supplements that can help support sexual health, function, and desire. 5 Herbs To Bring Back the Spark No matter your age, you deserve a healthy relationship with sex. If your desire for sexual activity is on the decline, we've got a list of herbal aphrodisiacs that can help boost your libido and support your sexual health. 1. Maca Root [Maca](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/maca), or lepidium meyenii, is a root vegetable that grows high in the Andes mountains.

Maca is nutrient-dense and contains many amino acids, like arginine, which is essential for making protein.REF#2551 Maca is also high in antioxidants, which can help manage oxidative stress in the body.REF#2551 Combined, these properties allow Maca to [encourage energy levels](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/maca-benefits-for-women) and help support your stamina. 2.

Herbal supplements are great libido boosters, but there are other steps you can take to support your sexual health. - Maintain a healthy weight. Being overweight can change hormone levels and affect your sex drive. In addition, having a high BMI can lead to health issues that can also drive your sex drive down.REF#2556 - Get plenty of exercise. Movement is important for your physical and emotional health, and it also raises levels of endorphins that can help elevate your mood. An elevated mood can lead to an elevated interest in intimacy. Plus, exercise can help with weight loss, which can also support your libido. - Avoid alcohol and drug use. One drink may put you in the mood, but alcohol misuse can lead to sexual dysfunction, especially in men.REF#2557 If you plan to drink, limit yourself to one drink or less for men and two drinks or less for women. Taking basic care of yourself can help support your sex drive and also help support your overall health. It's a win/win that has incredible results. The Bottom Line A decrease in libido can be common as we age, but that doesn't mean we're without ways to support it. Herbal remedies have been trusted as aphrodisiacs for millennia, and we can use them to support our sexual health today.
