Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) and Related Compounds Executive Summary Polychlorinated bipheny ls (PCBs), dibenzo- p-dioxins (PCD persistent, usually man-made chem icals. D ue to concerns over potential adverse ecological and hum an health effects, the manufacture of PCBs was banned several decades ago by many industrial nations. However, trace amounts of PCD Ds and PCD Fs continue to be unintentionally produced during som e industrial processes. PBD Es are currently used as fire retardants in many consum er products, although several PBDEs will soon be banned by the European U nion and the State of California. Efforts are being m ade to dispose of PCB-like chem icals in a responsible m anner, but som e have been accidentally released into the environm ent by industrial nations. Due to their environm ental persistence, PCB-like chem icals have becom e distributed in sm all quantities throughout the globe. These Persistent O rganic Pollu- tants (PO Ps) have been transported from tem perate regions to the arctic through the atm osphere, oceans and the marine food chain. In aquatic environm ents, PO Ps partition from water into organic m aterial and biom agnify up the food chain. In A laska and throughout the A rctic, people who consum e large quantities of subsistence foods from the sea are exposed to these potentially toxic chem icals, as are consum ers of m any othe r foods. The focus of this chapter is to review what is know n about the levels of PCB-like chem icals in subsis tence foods in A laska and the potential hazards they m ay pose to hum an health, using the most recent data available. A prelim inary assessm ent of subsistence food safety is presented, and key know ledge gaps are identified. A lthough inform ation about the concentrations of PO Ps in subsistence foods in Alaska is limited, recent studies included in this revision have broadened our know ledge. Data that are available from several Alaskan studies are of lim ited utility due to poor or undocum ented analy tical quality , particularly in older research. It is important to consider the quality and lim itations of existing POP data, because an uncritical interpretation of POP data can result in m isleading conclusions. For the purposes of this review, the quality of existing Alaskan data was scrutinized. While all available data were carefully considered, m ore weight was placed on POP data from studies that m et rigorous standards of analy tical quality . Our know ledge of PO P concentrations in the blood of humans in A laska is increasing. In addition to the Alaska Native serum bank study mentioned in our original monograph (Rubin et al., 2001), several additional investigations have since been conducted or are ongoing. In general, these investigations have docum ented the extent to which A laskans have been exposed to PO Ps. Serum concentrations of P CBs in those Alaskans who have been tested w ere higher than those docum ented in the general population from the Low er 48, although they were similar to Great La kes fish-eaters. Serum concentrations of dioxins, fu rans and coplanar PCBs in Alaskans were sim ilar to other Americans. In Alaska, as elsew here, serum PO P concentrations w ere strongly associated with age and w ere higher in older persons. Serum POP concentrations we re relatively low in wom en of childbearing age. A ll PO P exposures docum ented in Alaska were far below concentrations associated with know n adverse health effects. There are a number of potential hum an health concerns related to exposure to PCB-like chem icals. Som e consequences of acute, accidental high-dose PCB exposure are obvious; the skin disorder chloracne is particularly diagnostic. D oses of PCBs that cause such obvious effects are orders of magnitude greater than the background exposures encounter ed by Alaskans through the food chain. Risks about w hich public health officials are m ost concerned w hen considering subsistence food issues in A laska are chronic, long-term or subtle effects that m ay occur at very low PCB dose concentrations. In particular, cancer, im munotoxicity , reproductive toxicity , and developm ental/neurobehavioral toxicity have been considered as potential e ndpoints of exposure to PCB- like chem icals. D ue to the controversy and confusion surrounding these endpoints and their relationships with exposure to PCB-like chem icals, this report considers these issues in som e detail. Thousands of studies have exam ined the potential health effects of PCBs and related com pounds. The results of these studies have often been conflicting and difficult to interpret. Overall, we conclude that there is som e small, unproven but theoretical risk of subtle health effects related to low -level exposure to PCB-like chem icals. These subtle effects may be im possible to detect with existing scientific and m edical technology . Alternatively , there m ay be no adverse effects resulting from low-level PCB exposures such as those encountered through consum ption of subsistence foods or store-bought foods. 1 Risks in Perspective - PCBs The potential risks associated w ith PO P exposure through subsistence food consum ption are sm aller than the risks associated with a decreased use of traditional foods, or the risks associated w ith m any other aspects of Alaskan life. A decreased reliance on traditional foods would have a negative net effect on hum an health in native Alaskan com munities. Traditional foods have important nutritional benefits as well as cultural and econom ic benefits. The D ivision of Public H ealth strongly encourages the continued unrestricted consum ption of traditional foods. Concentrations of PCB-like chem icals vary substantially among species and tissues. The highest concentrations of PCBs are likely to be found in the fatty tissues of anim als that occupy the highest trophic levels of the m arine food chain. In m arine m ammals, tissue concentrations are often higher in older anim als, and in m ale anim als relative to female anim als. Recent studies of Alaskan fish have docum ented very low concentrations of PCB-like chem icals. Alaskan fish can be consum ed safely in unlim ited quantities. Most Alaskan fish and seafood have lower PCB concentrations th an fish from the Lower 48, which reflects the relatively rem ote, nearly industry-free environm ent of m any regions of A laska. The highest current concentrations of PCBs know n in A laska are in the blubber of transient killer whales, and relatively high concentrations have also been detected in stellar sea lion blubber. Concentrations of PCBs in beluga w hale blubber from Alaska are som ewhat higher than the concentrations found in G reat Lakes fish, although they are within the same order of m agnitude. Marine m ammal blubber is often consum ed in combination with epiderm is; this \" muktuk\" has lower POPs concentrations than blubber alone. All Alaskan human biom onitoring data to date provides evidence that wom en of childbearing age have been exposed to concentrations of contam inants far below those associated with adverse health effects to the fetus. Therefore, in view of the know n health benefits of traditional food consum ption to the m other and infant, the continued unrestricted c onsum ption of all Alaskan traditional foods is recom mended. Future research should focus on addressing the follow ing key know ledge gaps: Monitoring of subsistence species for POP concen- trations in tissues should focus on six species: the beluga whale, Stellar sea lion, northern fur seal, Pacific w alrus, ringed seal and bearded seal. Among Alaskan subsistence foods, th e first three species have the potential to accum ulate the greatest concentrations of PCBs in their tissues. The Pacific walrus is an important subsistence species, and PCB concen-trations have the potential for elevation in \" rogue\" anim als that prey on seals (it is unknow n whether this behavior is com mon in Pacific w alrus in A laska). The ringed seal is significant due to its m oderate level of contam ination and high rate of consum ption by Alaskan natives. Monitoring the bearded seal is important because it is a pr eferred native food source, and very few sam ples have been analyzed for POP concentrations to date. Monitoring of PO P concentrations in hum an tissues such as serum , adipose tissue or breast m ilk has only recently taken place in Alaska, and m ore data are needed. Exposure m easurem ents are especially needed for poly brominated dipheny l ethers (PBD Es), w hich have not yet been analyzed for in Alaskans. As the most direct indicator of hum an exposure to POPs, this inform ation is essential in or der for health officials to estim ate the risks associated with the consum ption of traditional foods. Measurem ent of PO P concentrations in Alaskans will enable a com parison of their exposures and risks relative to people in other circum polar areas that have previously been characterized, such as the Inuit of Quebec and Greenland. POP concentrations in prepared traditional foods should be characterized, and village-specific dietary survey s conducted to assess dietary exposure to these chem icals. This w ould provide inform ation on how food preparation methods influence PO P concen- trations, and help us to determ ine which foods contribute m ost to dietary exposures. This inform ation would be essential to any efforts to reduce future POP exposures, if desired, w hile continuing to enjoy a healthy subsistence lifesty le. The nature of PO P exposure through the A laska marine food chain needs to be characterized by use of sophisticated analy tical m ethods that have only recently been em ployed for Alaska sam ples. Patterns of PCB congeners vary significantly among species as a function of trophic level and metabolic capacity and among geographic areas, and these patterns influence toxicity . Congener-specific profiles w hich include the bioactive coplanar PCBs, PCDDs and PCDFs are needed for hum an tissues and for the m ore contam inated subsistence food species. In order to achieve adequate detection of im portant trace congeners, these coplanar analy ses should focus on fatty tissues such as m arine m ammal blubber and human m ilk. 2 Risks in Perspective - PCBs General Background Information on Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) and Related Compounds Polychlorinated bipheny ls (PCBs), dibenzo- p-dioxins (\"dioxins\") inated dipheny l ethers (PBD Es) are structurally similar PO P chem icals (Figure 1). Com plex mixtures of these chem icals are present as trace environm ental contam inants in water, soil, sedim ent, air and biota throughout the w orld. Structur al features com mon to this chem ical group include tw o arom atic rings and some degree of halogen substitution, and within each class the basic carbon structure is the sam e. Congeners within each class differ by the degree and position(s) of halogen substitution, m ost com monly by chlorine or brom ine. There are E congeners theoretically possible, although they are not all present in the environm ent. Sources Thousands of tons of PCBs were manufactured in m any countries throughout the N orthern hem isphere from the late 1920s through the early 1970s for a variety of commercial purposes (Kimbrough, 1980). PCBs are useful as heat transfer fluids, dielectric fluids for transform ers and capacitors , plasticizers, hydraulic lubricants, flam e retardants, and adhesives, in addition to a variety of other applications (Safe, 1994b). Com mercial PCB m ixtures w ere usually marketed according to their percentage of chlorine content by weight. In the United States, the Monsanto Chem ical Com pany manufactured PCBs under the trade name Aroclor. Products included A roclors 1016, 1221, 1232, 1242, 1248, 1254 and 1260, w here the last tw o digits denoted the percentage of chlorine content. Com mercial PCBs w ere also produced by other com panies in other countries under different trade nam es, including Clophen (Germany) and Kanechlor (Japan) (Safe, 1994b). The United States explicitly banned the production and use of PCBs in the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 (Silbergeld and D eFur, 1994), although the com pounds are still present in older equipm ent m anufactured before that tim e. In m any other countries, including most members of the O rganization for Econom ic Cooperation and D evelopm ent (O ECD ), PCBs have also been banned or their uses restricted in commerce and industry (Silbergeld and D eFur, 1994). In contrast to the PCBs, dioxins and furans have not been intentionally manufactured. Ra ther, they are created as unintentional by products during the manufacture of other chem icals or as a result of som e industrial processes. Trace am ounts of these chem icals are form ed by the pulp and paper industry when pulp is bleached with chlorine (Hrutfiord and N egri, 1992), and during certain ty pes of metal processing (O ehme et al., 1989). Spent graphite electrodes used in the chloralkali industry can be important localized sources of poly chlorinated dibenzo- furans (Zook and Rappe, are produced as unw anted by products during the manufacture of chem icals such as the w ood preservative pentachlorophenol and certain herbicides that include 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T (Webster and Com moner, 1994). In the U nited States, the burning of household w aste in backy ard burn barrels m ay be a m ajor source of airborne dioxin em issions (Lem ieux et al., 2003). Chlorinated dioxins and furans can be form ed during the com bustion of virtually any organic m aterial w hen chlorine is present, and their production has been associated w ith the burning of coal and the incineration of w astes. Chlorinated dioxins and furans are also created by natural processes, both by microorganism s and as a byproduct of com bustion (for exam ple, from forest fires) (Gribble, 1994). Forest and brush fires m ay be m ajor sources of chlorinated dioxins and furans in the environm ent (N estrick and Lam parski, 1982; Sheffield, 1985), although there is considerable evidence that anthropogenic inputs m ay be m ore significant than these natural sources (Kjeller et al., 1991; Tong et al., 1990; Webster and Com moner, 1994). Because dioxins and furans were never intentionally manufactured, efforts to reduce their creation have not focused on \" banning\" their production. Instead, regulations have focused on source abatem ent. Source abatem ent involves the alteration of production m ethods in problem industries to reduce dioxin and furan form ation, as w ell as improved cleanup prior to the release of w ater or air from industrial processes into the environm ent. Polybrom inated dipheny l ethers (PBDEs) are flam e retardants used in a wide variety of m aterials, most commonly the polyurethane foam used in seat cushions (Betts, 2001). They are also com mon com ponents of building m aterials, textiles, and electronic devices such as computers and televisions (D arnerud et al., 2001). PBD Es are thought to enter the environm ent via waste incineration, leaching from landfills, and volatilization into the surrounding air from electrical com ponents and other products (D arnerud et al., 2001). Three commercial mixtures are w idely used (penta-BD E, octa-BD E, and deca-BDE), which are im pure m ixtures of PBDE congeners ou et al., 2002). Large-scale produc- tion of PBD Es began in the early 1970s (Ikonom ou et al., 2002), and PBD E concentrations in the environm ent have increased substantially since that tim e. In the m id- 1990s, docum entation of rapidly rising concentrations of PBDEs in the breast m ilk of Swedish wom en led to sharply reduced usage, and eventually a ban, on m any PBD E form ulations in the European U nion (Darnerud et 3 Risks in Perspective - PCBs al., 2001). There are prelim inary data indicating that PBD E exposures in the U nited States and Canada m ay be the highest in the world, and that breast m ilk concentrations there are in creasing exponentially (Betts, 2002), but a sim ilar ban has not y et occurred in N orth America. The State of California has announced that it will ban two PBDE congeners shown to accum ulate in humans scheduled to take effect in 2008. Environmental C hemodynamics of PC B-like Chemica ls PCBs are an environm ental problem because they are persistent and lipophilic. Because of their stability and resistance to biodegradation, m any congeners undergo cycling and transport within the various com partments of the global ecosy stem (Safe, 1994b). Within aquatic system s, these chem icals partition from the water to organic material such as m arine zooplankton (H oekstra et al., 2002b). The PCBs then bioaccum ulate in the fatty tissues of m arine predators, increasing in concentration at each level of the food chain (Muir et al., 1992c). Factors unique to arctic ecosystem s may enhance the deposition of organochlorines from the atm osphere and increase their environm ental persistence. Polar regions may act as \"cold traps\" for som e of the m ore volatile organochlorine com pounds. Volatile, lower-chlorinated PCBs can be transported by the atm osphere from industrial nations in tem perate regions to the arctic, where cold tem peratures cause them to \"distill\" and settle (Wania and Mackay , 1993). The m ore highly chlorinated PCBs are less volatile and are less likely to remain in the atm osphere to reach the Arctic, but they may still arrive in the arctic in the bodies of migrating wildlife. Migrating wildlife can carry (\"biotransport\") PO Ps to remote areas of Alaska. In one study, sockeye salm on accum ulated POPs during their ocean life stage. Upon returning to their freshwater spawning areas via the Copper River, they transported these PO Ps to remote inland Alaskan lakes. The PO Ps from the salm on w ere incorporated into the freshw ater food w eb and were found in the bodies of the lake's arctic gray ling (Ew ald et al., 1998). The PO Ps concentrations m easured in the individual fish were far below those thought to be harm ful to fish health or reproduction and did not pose any health risk to hum an consum ers of the fish. Distributions of PCB congeners in Canadian arctic fish and marine mammals appear to be regulated by trophic level biom agnification properties, as they do not reflect the different phy sical-chem ical properties (such as volatility ) of individual congeners (Muir et al., 1988). Animals at low er trophic levels (such as arctic cod) contain patterns of PCBs sim ilar to com mercial PCB mixtures. A t higher trophic levels (such as marine mammals), lower chlorinated PCB congeners are not detectable, and m ore highly chlorinated congeners are dominant in PCB patterns (Muir et al., 1988). This may be due to the ability of som e marine m ammal species to metabolize and excrete the lower chlorinated PCB congeners. Outside of biological sy stem s, persistence of PCB-like chem icals is enhanced in the arctic environm ent due to slower reaction rates at low tem peratures, reduced photoly sis due to a low sun angle, and decreased biological activity (such as reduced scavenging of chem icals sorbed to (Wania and Mackay , 1993). In Alaska, the highest concentrations of PO Ps have been found in the fatty tissues of anim als that occupy the highest trophic levels of aquatic food chains. In particular, POPs accum ulate in the blubber and fatty tissues of marine mammals near the top of the m arine food chain, such as polar bears, orcas, and beluga w hales (Muir et al., 1992c). In fish, PO P concentrations are higher in species that consum e other fish, and in fatty species com pared to leaner species. POPs accum ulate in the body over tim e, so that concentrations are usually higher in older, larger fish. The sam e holds true for male marine mammals (Norstrom and Muir, 1994). H owever, adult fem ale m arine m ammals have the ability to transport POPs to the fetus and to excrete these contam inants in their breast m ilk; it is possible for their POP body burden to decrease follow ing the birth and nursing of y oung. Therefore, in adult marine mammals males often have higher blubber PO P concentrations than do fem ales (Muir et al., 1992a; Tanabe et al., 1987). Chemical A nalysis and R eporting of POP Concentrations in Environmental Samples Methods for analy zing PO Ps in environm ental samples are continually being developed and im proved. Different methods are used in various laboratories to isolate or \"extract\" PCBs from an environm ental sam ple, and then to separate and quantify them . Data produced by different analy tical m ethods often are not directly comparable. It is essential to consider the quality of quantitative chem ical analy ses prior to their use in risk assessm ent. A gas chrom atograph is usually used to separate or \"resolve\" the individual PCB congeners, which are detected with either electron capture or mass spectroscopy . Many early analy ses (pre-1980s) utilized low-resolution packed n chrom atography to separate the congeners, w hich produced a relatively 4 Risks in Perspective - PCBs small number (5-12) of poorly resolved peaks. This method has largely fallen out of favor. Many of these older analyses are of m arginal use today, as PCB peaks were poorly resolved and often erroneously included non-PCB compounds such as toxaphene congeners, chlordanes and DDT-related chem icals. Modern m ethods of chem ical separation use higher resolution capillary colum ns that m ore adequately separate most PCB congeners. With capillary colum n chrom atography , 80-90 can environm ental extracts, and toxaphenes, chlordanes and D DTs can be distinguished from PCBs. Follow ing chem ical separation, different m ethods can be used to quantify PCBs in a chrom atogram . \"Total PCBs\" can be calculated by matching the pattern of PCB peaks from a sam ple with the pattern produced by commercial Aroclor m ixtures, w ith use of pattern recognition algorithm s such as CO MSTA R (Burkhard, 1987). The pattern of PCB peaks is m atched with use of multiple regression procedures, and quantitation is perform ed by comparison to A roclor response factors. While this method provides a good approxim ation of \"total PCBs\", it is not ideal because the congener m ixtures that are present in the environm ent are not the same as the commercial mixtures that were originally released. Som e congeners are more persistent than are others. A s a result, their relative abundance increases in the environm ent over tim e (McFarland and Clarke, 1989; Safe, 1994b). Since PCB m ixtures in the environm ent differ from their original form ulations, m ost m odern analy tical approaches involve the quantitation and summing of targeted individual PCB congeners in the m ixture. This approach tends to lead to lower PCB concentrations than the \" total PCB\" approach (G iesy et al., 1997). All PCB congeners m ay not be included in the summation process. This is partly due to the fact that som e congeners do not separate w ell on the gas chrom atograph (Niimi et al., 1996). Sum med congener data m ay not be directly com parable from laboratory to laboratory , particularly if the sam e congeners are not chosen for quantitation, the sam e analy tical standards are not utilized, or if procedures for data analy sis and interpretation are different. Detection lim its and large differences in the abundance of individual congeners can also present analy tical challenges. A particular dilution of environm ental extract may contain som e congeners below the limit of detection, while other congeners are so abundant that their concentrations exceed the linear range of quantitation. There are also different approaches toward the statistical treatm ent of non-detected congeners. In a sample with a non-detectable chem ical concentration, the true concentration of the chem ical is a non-zero, non- measureable value that is know n to be below a defined threshold. When calculating statistics such as the m ean, the concentration of a non-detected chem ical in a sample may be treated as a zero, or as an estim ated value such as half the detection lim it (H ornung and Reed, 1990). The choice of how to treat non-detectable values affects the reported results, particularly if the chem ical was not detected in a large proportion of the total sam ples taken. In all of the procedures discussed so far, the m ost toxic congeners (i.e., the flat or \" coplanar\" congeners) are generally not included in these analyses. While coplanar congeners are usually only present in sm all quantities in a mixture, because of their potency they often contribute the vast majority of the overall toxicity of the m ixture (Johansen et al., 1994). Coplan ar PCBs are an important component of overall dioxin-like toxicity in marine ecosystem s, and the bioaccum ulation of coplanar PCB congeners in carnivorous m arine m ammals is of particular concern (Kannan et al., 1989). A special extraction procedure and sophisticated instrum ental analysis are required for coplanar PCB analysis. Few coplanar analyses have been perform ed for Alaskan environm ental sam ples, but these analyses are becom ing more com mon, and our know ledge of coplanar PCB concentrations in A laska should rapidly increase. Dioxins, furans and coplanar PCBs all express their toxicity through a com mon m echanism . It is com mon to add all of the \" dioxin-like\" activity of the individual chem icals together to arrive at a single number that represents its overall toxicity . With this approach, the potency of each individual dioxin, furan and coplanar PCB congener is scaled to the potency of the m ost toxic congener, w hich is tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). The potency of each coplanar PCB congener can be expressed in term s of a \"TCDD equivalency factor\" (TEF). For exam ple, a PCB congener that is half as potent as TCD D would have a TEF of 0.5. If congener-specific data are available, the overall toxicity of a m ixture can be estim ated by multiply ing the concentration of each congener by its TEF and then summing the toxicities to calculate TCDD-equivalents (TEQ s). The TEFs are periodically updated as new toxicological research in creases our know ledge of dioxin-like toxicity . Therefore, several \"sets\" of TEFs are available, and TEQs calculated with different TEFs are not directly com parable. The m ost recent, interna- tionally accepted TEFs were published in 1998 (Van den Berg et al., 1998). Quality assurance and control (QA/QC) are essential aspects of PCB analy sis. Without good QA/QC, there can be little confidence in the analy tical data that are generated. During the process of PCB extraction, trace 5 Risks in Perspective - PCBs quantities of these chem icals are isolated and concen- trated from samples. Background PCB contam ination in the laboratory can therefore be a serious problem , and blank sam ples m ust be periodically analy zed in order to assure that such contam ination does not exist. Care must be taken to ensure that sam ples are not contam inated during the sam pling process, during storage or during analysis. It is also im portant to analyze som e sam ples more than once, to determ ine analytical precision or \"repeatability \". Another effective QA/QC procedure is to \"spike\" a subsam ple with a known quantity of a PCB congener and then determ ine how much of that spike is recovered and quantitated during the analy tical process. The accuracy and precision of analytical m easurem ents vary as the concentration of the analyte in the sam ple changes. Accuracy refers to the ability to quantify the concentration of an analyte correctly, while precision refers to the ability to obtain the sam e value when analyses are repeated (regardless of whether that measurem ent was \" accurate\"). Each analy tical m ethod has a lim it of detection for each analyte, below which the detected concentration is not significantly different from zero. A nalytical m ethods also have a range of analy te concentrations for which accuracy and precision are optim ized. As the concentration of an analyte dim inishes and approaches the m ethod detection lim it, accuracy and precision of analytical resu lts are decreased. In the optim al concentration range for an analyte the accuracy of a m easurem ent should be \u00b1 20%, but (by definition) near the lim it of detection a detected concentration approaches an error of \u00b1 200% (Tay lor, 1989). Since POP analy ses often involve trace quantities of analy te, it is important to investigate and report lim its of detection and the relative confidence of values in different data ranges. It is desirable to obtain a sufficient quantity of sam ple in order to achieve analyte concentrations within the optim al analytical range whenever possible. This allows the collection of robust analy tical data rather than a host of \"non-detects\". In order to accurately determ ine the concentration of trace POP con centrations in biota, it is often necessary to analyze fatty tissues that are m ost likely to contain the highest concentrations of these chem icals. Instrum ent detection lim its are related to the concentration of analyte in a final extract. Consequently, detection of analyte in a sam ple can be enhanced by extracting a larger am ount of sam ple in order to obtain more analy te molecules, and/or by reducing the final extract to a sm aller volum e. Pilot studies can be helpful to determ ine the sufficiency of proposed sample quantities. Rather than analyzing tissues that do not accum ulate POPs to a significant extent (such as plants), lim ited resources can be m ore effec tively used by increasing the sample size for anim al species of concern. In marine mammals, POP concentrations are m uch higher in blubber than in internal organs, m aking their quantitation more robust. In hum ans, adipose tissue and breast milk (Needham and Wang, 2002) are tw o fatty tissues that are likely to contain higher POP concentrations. Because the lipid content is low in hum an new born cord blood, PO P quantitation is difficult in this tissue. Concentrations of PO Ps in biological tissues can be reported in w hole w eight, w et weight, dry weight, or \"lipid adjusted\" term s. The choice of reporting method greatly changes the resulting value. Direct comparisons of chem ical concentrations should never be made betw een results that have been expressed in different terms unless data are provided to allow conversion to equivalent units. For exam ple, PO P concentrations reported in \" dry weight\" term s will be higher than those reported in \" wet weight\" term s, because chem ical concentrations have been concentrated in \"dry weight\" samples as all moisture was rem oved. However, if data for percent m oisture have been included for each sample, it is possible to convert data betw een the tw o reporting methods. Biological sam ples are often reported in \"lipid-adjusted\" terms, such as \"ng/g lipid\". This practice allows researchers to account for differences in lipid (fat) content betw een various tissues, and for differences in fasting and feeding status (Phillips et al., 1989). POPs are highly lipophilic, and they partition among various tissues depending on their lipid content. For exam ple, the whole weight concentration of POPs in a fatty tissue such as adipose will be m uch higher than the whole weight PO P concentration in a lean tissue such as blood, but adipose and blood PO P concentrations in an individual will be very sim ilar when com pared on a \"lipid-adjusted\" basis. Similarly , wet weight concen- trations of POPs in blood will increase following consum ption of a fatty meal, as POPs partition from other tissues into the fat-enhanced bloodstream . These changes in feeding status can be corrected for by expressing PO P concentrations in \" lipid-adjusted\" terms. It is very important not to directly com pare results that are not reported in the sam e term s, because \"lipid- adjusted\" concentrations of POPs will be higher than values that are expressed in w hole w eight, or w et weight, units. Due to the varied m ethods that are used to quantitate and report POPs in environm ental sam ples, caution m ust be taken when interpreting values. In particular, it can be difficult to com pare the results obtained by different laboratories, especially when the analyses were perform ed during significantly different tim e periods. Small differences in POP quantities reported in various 6 Risks in Perspective - PCBs samples from different studies m ay not be m eaningful, as they may represent m easurem ent variability rather than inherent differences betw een sam ples. It is im perative that analy tical m ethodologies be review ed in detail, including the quality assurance and control program s, in order to have confidence in the data and its interpretation. Current efforts are em phasizing the certification of standard reference m aterials (Schantz et al., 1995a), collaboration am ong analy tical laboratories, and rigorous analy tical m ethodology and Q A/QC protocols so that results can be more directly comparable (Becker et al., 1993; Becker et al., 1997b). The Importance of Congener-Specific PCB and Dioxin Data and Its Interpretation PCBs, dioxins, furans, PBD Es and related chem icals are quantitated and reported in m any different ways. For PCBs, laboratories m ay measure and report the individual values of a subset of the 209 possible congeners. The specific list and num ber of included congeners varies w idely am ong laboratories. \" Total PCBs\" can be estim ated in a variety of ways, such as summing the values of the m easured congeners, summing the m easured congeners and apply ing a correction factor, or perform ing pattern analy sis and multiple regression techniques. In som e analy ses non- detected congeners are treated as zero values, w hile in others a positive value is estim ated based on the detection lim it of the congener. These quantitative complexities create challenges for data comparison betw een studies. G reat care and m eticulous scrutiny of detail must be taken to assure that com parisons are scientifically valid and appropriate. The use of \" total PCB\" concentrations during the risk assessm ent process im poses an error on subsequent estim ates of the toxicity of environm ental samples. \"Total PCBs\" generally do not include or consider the coplanar PCBs, dioxins or furans in environm ent samples. These planar congeners can represent a significant proportion of the total dioxin-like toxicity in terms of TEQs. Estim ates of risk can vary significantly, depending on whether total PCBs or calculated TCD D- equivalents from coplanar dioxin-like congeners are used. For exam ple, the derived potency (with use of USEPA risk assessm ent procedures) of a PCB mixture extracted from Great Lakes salm on was 3.7 times greater when calculated as TEQs from coplanar PCBs than when calculated as total PCBs based on Aroclor pattern matching (William s et al., 1992). The problem becom es even m ore severe when \" total PCBs\" are used to compare the relative toxicity of various subsistence foods from the m arine environm ent. Patterns of PCB congeners vary significantly among arctic m arine species, and these patterns m ay profoundly influence their overall toxicity . The relative abundance of various PCB congeners in the arctic environm ent and biota has been determ ined. Anim al species vary in their metabolic capabilities to depurate chem icals. In arctic cod from Canada, the pattern of PCB congeners w as rem arkably similar to an Aroclor standard m ixture (1242:1254:1260, 0.6:3:1) et er-chlorinated congeners such as penta- and hexachlorobipheny ls were well represented in the arctic cod sam ples. In contrast, these lower- chlorinated congeners w ere less com mon in ringed seal blubber, and w ere virtually absent in polar bear fat. PCB congener profiles of ringed seal and polar bear w ere dominated by higher-chlorinated congeners such as hepta-, octa- and nona/decachlorbipheny ls. These data indicate that the ringed seal and polar bear were able to preferentially metabolize and elim inate the lower- chlorinated PCB congeners, in contrast to the arctic cod which could not. Interestingly , PCB congener profiles from narw hal and beluga blubber resem bled those from cod, and contained a substantial proportion of low er- chlorinated congeners (N orstrom and Muir, 1994). Differences in PCB congener profiles am ong m arine species have been attributed to differences in metabolic capabilities related to specific cy tochrom e P450 enzym es. Sm all cetaceans such as porpoise, beluga and narw hal do not m etabolize PCBs with adjacent non-chlorinated meta and para positions efficiently. This deficiency in cetaceans has been attributed to a low activity of CYP 2B, the enzy me responsible for m etabolism of m ost PCB congeners in higher anim als (Tanabe et al., 1988). Bow head w hales collected by subsistence hunters in Barrow , Alaska exhibited little (Hoekstra et al., 2003) to no (Hoekstra et al., 2002c) CY P 2B-like biotransform ation of of coplanar dioxin-like congeners also vary among m arine species, and their relative contributions to TEQs vary accordingly. In general, concentrations of non-ortho PCBs were sim ilar betw een narw hal, beluga and ringed seal from the Canadian A rctic (Ford et al., 1993). In contrast, concentr ations of m ono-ortho PCBs were m uch greater in narw hal and beluga than in ringed seal. Chlorinated dioxins and furans w ere found to contribute 37 to 42% of total TEQ s in ringed seals, but less than 5% of total TEQ s in narw hal and beluga (Ford et al., 1993). A nother study confirm ed that beluga have an exceptional ability to m etabolize non-ortho PCB congeners and TCD D (Norstrom et al., 1992), a capacity attributed to high levels of CYP-1A activity in cetaceans (Watanabe et al., 1989). The bow head w hale can also metabolize PCBs via CYP1A-related pathway s, but the structural determ inants of PCB biotransform ation in that species are com plex (H oekstra et al., 2002c). 7 Risks in Perspective - PCBs Metabolic differences and subsequent PO P congener profiles can have a dram atic influence on the toxicity of POP mixtures found in arctic anim als. The implications of these differences for our risk assessm ent are profound. In particular, it is possible that our risk assessm ent m ay have overestim ated the relative toxicity of beluga blubber but underestim ated the relative toxicity of ringed seal blubber. This is because beluga blubber is likely to contain a low er proportion of the m ost toxic coplanar dioxin-like congeners than ringed seal blubber does. Due to this dilem ma, collection of congener-specific data is becom ing increasingly com mon in environm ental studies. While total PCBs have been used successfully to predict TEQs within a defined sy stem (William s et al., 1992), location-specific background data are initially needed to define applicable congener-specific relationships. Congener-specific relationships must be determ ined on a location-by-location basis, because there is major geographic variability in the ratio of TCDD to total PCBs among arctic m arine m ammals (N orstrom and Simon, 1990). In a place as vast and varied as Alaska, background know ledge is insufficient and congener- specific data are m ore useful for toxicologic interpretation. Concentrations of PCBs in Alaskan Subsistence Foods and Other Wildlife Although data about the concentrations of PO Ps in subsistence foods in A laska are far m ore lim ited than we would like, recent studies (included in this revision) have contributed substantially to our know ledge. Far m ore comprehensive studies have been perform ed in the Canadian Arctic (Jensen et al., 1997; K uhnlein et al., 1995; Murray , 1992; Murray et al., 1996; Murray and Shearer, 1993; Murray and Shearer, 1994). D espite the relative paucity of data from Alaska, we are able to compare available Alaskan data to Canadian data in order to see whether they are in the same general range. While sm all differences in num bers m ay not be meaningful, as discussed above, it is probably quite safe to com pare relative orders of m agnitude betw een Canadian and Alaskan studies. In fact, som e of the Alaskan samples have been analyzed in Canadian laboratories, and in these cas es the data are directly comparable. We conducted an exhaustive review of the literature to investigate PCB concentrations in A laskan fish and marine m ammals. Peer-reviewed publications, govern- ment docum ents and accessible unpublished research reports were reviewed. The quality of data from each study was carefully evaluated by exam ining the analy tical methodology , methods and lim its of quantitation, and quality assurance provisions. Although all data available were carefully considered, we did not include some data (particularly from older research) in this report because of their inadequate quality. Problem s with excluded studies included a lack of inform ation about quality assurance or analy tical m ethodology , outdated m ethodology and/or unacceptably high limits of detection for PCBs (McFall et al., 1986; Miles et al., 1992; Tay lor et al., 1989). Selected PCB data for m arine m ammals and freshwater fish from Alaska and Canada that w ere obtained w ith use of sim ilar analy tical m ethods and quality assurance provisions through 1997 are sum marized in Tables 1 and 2 respectively. Table 3 presents more recent PCB data for A laskan m arine m ammal subsistence species, salm on, and bird eggs, while Table 4 presents recent PCB data for Alaskan wildlife species or tissues not ty pically consum ed by hum ans. In the selected studies, high- resolution chrom atography was used to separate individual PCB congeners, w hich w ere then sum med to estim ate total PCBs. PCBs and other contam inants were recently evaluated in two salm on species from the Y ukon and Kuskokw im Rivers (Y -K) (USFWS, unpublished data). PCB concen- trations in chinook and chum salm on m uscle from the Y-K region were more than 100-fold lower than concentrations ty pically found in salm on from the Great Lakes, and m ore than 150-fold lower than the FDA action limit of 2 ppm for fish sold in com merce (Table 3, Figure 2). PCB concentrations were particularly low in chum salm on from the K uskokw im River, where they were only detectable in 3 of 19 fish. Low PCB concentrations have also been observed in freshw ater fish from Schrader Lake in th e northern Interior region of Alaska (Wilson et al., 1995). Coplanar PCBs, dioxins and furans have recently been measured in a few Alaskan sam ples. D ioxin TEQ s in flatfish from Dutch Harbor were sim ilar to concentrations found in freshw ater fish from U.S. arkets, s in m ussels and urchins from nearby bays were low er than concentrations found in m any superm arket and fast foods (Figure 3) (Alaska Section iology , 2001; Schecter ioxin TEQ s derived from coplanar PCB analy sis w ere very low in chinook and chum salm on m uscle from the Yukon and Kuskokw im Rivers, averaging 1.8 ppt and 0.02 ppt, respectively (USFWS, unpublished data). PCB and dioxin concentrations are quite high in a few Alaskan wildlife species/tissues that are not typically consum ed for subsistence, including polar bear fat and liver and killer whale blubber (Table 4). It is not surprising that PO P concentrations are relatively high in these fatty tissues from species at the top of the m arine food chain. 8 Risks in Perspective - PCBs The concentrations of PCBs pr esented in this report were determ ined from freshly caught anim als prior to preparation for hum an consum ption. Preparation methods can significantly reduce the concentration of PCBs in fish, particularly if fat and skin are removed or if the fish is cooked (U SEPA , 1996). PCB content w as reduced by an average of 30% when Great Lakes fish were cooked (USEPA , 1996). When fish are sm oked their organochlorine contam inant burden can also be significantly reduced. In one study , PCB concentrations were decreased by 46% in Great Lakes Lake Trout that were sm oked (skin-on) (U SEPA , 1996). The effect that traditional food preparation methods unique to A laskan N atives m ay have on POP concentrations has not been directly investigated. In a study of Canadian Inuit food preparation m ethods, the boiling of m arine m ammal blubber appeared to cause a modest decrease in PCB concentrations (Chan et al., 1996). In contrast, the om ega-3 fatty acid content of walrus blubber was not changed by boiling or fry ing compared to raw blubber. Future studies should investigate how traditional m ethods of subsistence food preparation affect the concentr ations of PO Ps in fish and marine m ammals as they are consum ed by Native Alaskans. Species-Specific Data Gaps Future studies of PO P content in A laskan subsistence foods should initially focus on m arine m ammal species of most concern. Additional inform ation is needed on POP concentrations in belugas, w hich are rather high in Alaska. D ata from Point Lay belugas suggest that POP concentrations m ay be greater in m ale than fem ale belugas (K rahn et al., 1999). H owever, in belugas sampled from the Southern Beaufort Sea in Canada, POPs w ere high in both m ales and fem ales (Muir, 1996). This is of concern because belugas from the Mackenzie River Delta and Beaufort Sea m igrate to Alaskan waters (O'Corry-Crow e et al., 1997) and are hunted by Alaskan natives along the north slope (Robert Suy dam, personal communication). Concentrations of PO Ps w ere low er in belugas from Cook Inlet than in belugas from the Chukchi Sea. Further research is needed to clarify the relationship betw een POP contam ination, location, sex and age in belugas. Research should also focus on the ringed seal, harbor seal and bearded seal, because they are commonly consum ed by Alaskan N atives. A determ ination of TEQ s in follow ing analy sis for coplanar congeners is particularly needed, especially as it is processed for food. In the prior version of this m onograph, w e recom mended prioritized analysis of Paci fic w alrus in A laska. Sincethat tim e, tw o studies have been published that docum ented low POP concentrations in Pacific Walrus blubber from the Bering Sea, relative to POP blubber (Seagars and Garlich- Miller, 2001; Struntz and Kucklick, 2000). In the Canadian Arctic, som e Pacific w alrus had unexpectedly high concentrations of PO Ps in blubber (Muir et al., 1992b). Walrus at Inukjuak w ith high POP blubber concentrations (an average of 11.5 ppm PCBs in m ales, wet weight) were thought to have been feeding at a higher trophic level than usual, and predation on ringed seals w as suspected (Muir et al., 1995). Although seal predation w as once thought to be an uncom mon behavior confined to large male walrus, the behavior m ay be m ore common than previously believed. A lthough seal predation has also been observed in Pacific w alrus in Alaska (Low ry and Fay , 1984), it is unknow n how common that behavior m ight be. Ecological research to determ ine the incidence of seal predation am ong w alrus in Alaska w ould be helpful, as only these \"rogue walrus\" are likely to have elevated PO P blubber concentrations. Additional inform ation is needed on blubber PO P concentrations in northern fur seals. A recent study has measured comparatively high PCB concentrations in fur seals in Alaska, which the authors speculated m ay have been due to their higher trophic level and m ore extensive annual m igrations in potentially contam inated areas relative to other Alaskan seal species (Krahn et al., 1997). Finally , a sixth marine m ammal that w arrants focused research is the Stellar sea lion. Although few samples have been analyzed, available data indicate that Stellar sea lion blubber contains som e of the highest PCB concentrations among m arine m ammals in A laska. Stellar sea lions have the potential to bioaccum ulate higher concentrations of organic contam inants, because they have a m arine m ammal component to their diet. Stellar sea lions are know n to eat northern fur seal pups, sometimes in large num bers (H oover, 1988). There is also speculation that Alaskan Stellar sea lions may becom e exposed to PCBs along their m igration route, which encom passes offshore ar eas of southern California (Varanasi et al., 1993). For all m arine m ammal species consum ed by humans, there is a need to investigate the distribution of POP concentrations am ong individual anim als in a population. Some contam inants, such as heavy m etals, are highly skew ed in marine mammal populations. A few indi- viduals have very high contam inant concentrations, while m ost individuals have much lower concentrations. The extent to which this is true for POP concentrations in marine mammal tissues such as blubber requires further research. 9 Risks in Perspective - PCBs Time Trends of POP Concen trations in the Arctic Environment There are insufficient data to conclude whether concentrations of PCB-like chem icals in the Alaskan environm ent have been increasing or decreasing over time, although available data indicate that PCB concentrations are declining. For exam ple, decreasing PCB concentrations have been observed in Peregrine Falcons in Alaska over the last several decades (Ambrose et al., 2000). D ata collection of PCB concentrations in the Canadian arctic environm ent has been more comprehensive and long-term than in A laska. Time trend inform ation is em erging for the Canadian A rctic, and this m ay shed light on w hat might be happening in Alaska. O n Ellesm ere Island in N unavut, air samples were collected w eekly and analy zed for PCBs (H ung et al., 2001). D uring the tim e period from 1993-1997, there was evidence of a declining trend for several of the lighter, less chlorinated PCB congeners. H owever, w ith the exception of PCB 180, the m ore chlorinated PCB congeners did not decline over that time period. This was in m arked contrast to temperate sites, indicating a lag tim e for decline between the Arctic and source regions. Half-lives of PCBs w ere longer at N unavut relative to tem perate sites, perhaps due to the lower temperatures and darkness at N unavut, and the process of global fractionation. A lack of decline of PCB concentrations has also been observed in biota from arctic Canada and G reenland. A decline in PCB concentrations w as not observed betw een 1978 and 1988 in w alrus from Greenland (Muir et al., 2000). In the Western Canadian A rctic, PCB concen- trations in ringed seal blubber decreased significantly from 1972 to 1981, but then did not decrease further betw een 1981 and 1991 (A ddison and Sm ith, 1998). Concentrations of PCBs in polar bears in the eastern Canadian A rctic appear to have increased form the 1970s to the 1980s, w hile PCB concentrations in ringed seal blubber show ed no significant change from the m id- 1980s to 1990s (Muir and N orstrom , 2000). Further work on time trends in polar bears and ringed seals w ith samples collected from the late 1990s has been urged to confirm anticipated declining trends in PCBs (Muir and Norstrom , 2000). Concern is emerging w orldwide regarding increasing concentrations of poly brominated dipheny l ethers (PBDEs) in wildlife (and hum ans, to be discussed later). Exponential increases in PBD E concentrations have recently been demonstrated in Canadian and Great Lakes wildlife. In Canadian arctic ringed seal blubber, PBD Es increased exponentially during the period 1981 - 2000 (Ikonom ou et al., 2002). PBD E concentrations in arctic ringed seals are currently far low er than PCB and dioxin concentrations, but if current rates of bioaccum ulation continue, PBDEs will surpass PCBs to becom e the most prevalent PO P com pound in Canadian arctic ringed seals by the year 2050 (Ikonom ou et al., 2002). PBD Es are also increasing exponentially in G reat Lakes Herring Gulls, w ith a doubling tim e of around 3 y ears for the Penta-BD E congeners (N orstrom et al., 2002) (Figure 4). If current PCB and PBDE trends continue, it will only take 10 -15 years for PBD Es to becom e the m ost abundant POP contam inant in the G reat Lakes (N orstrom et al., 2002). To our know ledge, PBD Es have not y et been m easured in the A laskan environm ent or human population. These chem icals of emerging concern should be a high priority for investigation in A laska. Potential Health Effects of PCB-like Chemicals There are a num ber of vexatious and contentious public health concerns related to exposure to PCBs, dioxins and related chem icals. Biological changes follow ing PCB or dioxin exposure can be m easured using a variety of different endpoints. Some biochem ical changes, such as the induction of certain enzy mes, are quite specific to this class of compounds and are expected responses. However, the functional significance of such alterations is often not clear. O ther potential endpoints that are functionally more relevant, such as cancer or immunosuppression, can be caused or influenced by a variety of factors and cannot, w ith current scientific technology and understanding, be unam biguously attributed to low -level PO P exposures in free-ranging wildlife and hum ans. Some of the adverse biological effects that are associated with exposure to PCB-like ch emicals have been observed prim arily in laboratory anim als treated with relatively high doses. It is difficult, and in some cases not valid, to extrapolate results obtained from high dose anim al laboratory studies to the possible effects that m ight occur in hum ans exposed to chronic low doses. \"Chronic\" effects such as cancer that are observed in anim al studies at high doses m ay be related to frank cellular toxicity and resultant cell proliferation, w hereas the subtle long-term effects of low doses m ay be related to a complex alteration of horm onal sy stem s involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. There is a large degree of variability in susceptibility to PCB-like chem icals among species, and there can also be great inter- individual variability in susceptibility within a species (DeVito et al., 1995). The m ost toxic PCBs exert their effects on organism s through a com mon m echanism (Poland and Knutson, 1982). In the cell, these dioxin-like chem icals bind to the arom atic hy (AhR) the dioxin/A hR com plex interacts with DNA. Th is in teractio n resu lts in an alteratio n of 10 Risks in Perspective - PCBs gene expression, w hich m ediates the responses of the organism to dioxin-like chem icals (Landers and Bunce, 1991). The toxicity of individual congeners is determ ined by their relative affinities for the AhR. Congeners that can assum e a coplanar configuration have a greater affinity for the AhR, and are thus the m ore toxic PCBs. Relatively few congeners are coplanar, and they are usually minor com ponents of PCB m ixtures in the environm ent. As discussed earlier, it is com mon to com pare the AhR- mediated potency of individual coplanar PCB congeners relative to the potency of the m ost toxic congener, in terms of a \" TCDD equivalency factor\" (TEF). This approach assum es that the toxicities of the congeners are additive, and that the congeners do not interact in an antagonistic or sy nergistic m anner. The non-planar PCB congeners or their m etabolites elicit som e toxic responses, such as neurobehavioural, neurochem ical, carcinogenic and endocrinological changes, that do not appear to be m ediated by the A hR (A hlborg et al., 1992). The TEQ approach cannot presently be applied to these non-A hR responses. The degree of hazard associated with hum an exposure to PCBs and dioxins is of sc ientific controversy , and scientific opinions have changed over time (Hanson, 1991). In early assessm ents, TCD D was dubbed \" the most toxic synthetic chem ical know n to m an\". This w as largely due to its great potency in guinea pigs, w hich die follow ing exposure to m inute concentrations of TCD D (the LD 50 is approxim ately 0.6 \u00b5g/kg for this species). With further study, we learned that there are dram atic differences in species sensitivity to TCDD. For exam ple, about a 1,000 to 10,000-fold greater dose of TCD D is required to kill a ham ster than a guinea pig (DeVito and Birnbaum , 1994). O n the com parative scale of species sensitivity , som e scientists conclude that humans are relatively insensitive to the adverse effects of TCDD and other planar dioxin-like chem icals. Following several large accidental PCB, dioxin and furan exposure incidents, the only observed adverse effects in humans that have been unequivocally linked to PCB- and dioxin-like chem icals have been chloracne (Suskind, 1985) and other skin disorders (Lu and Wu, 1985); there may also be an association with increased cancer incidence in heavily exposed populations (Bertazzi et al., 1987; Bertazzi et al., 1993; Fingerhut et al., 1991). Following an industrial accident in Seveso, Italy at which TCDD was released in large am ounts, anim al m ortality was about 25% in the m ost directly impacted zone although none of the 733 persons present in the m ost contam inated zone were killed (Bertazzi and Di Domenico, 1994; Pocchiari et al., 1979). Current analy ses continue the scientific controversy over the degree of hum an sensitivity to the toxic effects of dioxin- like chem icals (D eVito et al., 1995). Concern continues because exposure to chronic, low concentrations of dioxins m ay produce subtle toxic effects that are difficult to detect. The industrial and occupational incidents that produced obvious deleterious effects in humans involved exposures to PCBs or dioxi ns that w ere orders of magnitude greater than the background exposures in the United States, or exposures related to the consum ption of traditional foods in the A rctic. For exam ple, adverse birth outcom es such as decreased birth w eights, delay ed developm ental m ilestones and skin disorders occurred in the offspring of Taiw anese w omen who consum ed rice oil contam inated with PCBs and furans. The average body burden of the w omen involved in that poisoning incident know n as Y u-Cheng w as 2130 ng TEQ /kg body weight, which was 164 tim es greater than the average human background body burden of 13 ng TEQ /kg body weight (D eVito et al., 1995). The PCB/dioxin risks about w hich public health professionals and Alaska citizens are m ost concerned are chronic, long-term or subtle effects that may occur at very low dose levels from subsistence foods. The following evaluation will discuss four possible chronic effects that are of prim ary concern with regard to PCB/dioxin exposure: cancer, neurobehavioral changes, reproductive im pairm ent and im munosuppression. In general, these negative health outcom es can all be caused or influenced by a variety of genetic, nutritional, physiologic, lifesty le, and other factors and are impossible to attribute unam biguously to low -level PCB or dioxin exposure in hum ans. Cancer Cancer is a group of m any related diseases. A ll form s of cancer involve out-of-control grow th and spread of cells (Alaska Cancer Registry , 2002). Cancer is classified by the part of the body in w hich it began, and by its appearance under a m icroscope. D ifferent ty pes of cancer vary in their rates of grow th, patterns of spread, and responses to different types of treatm ent. Cancers occur in all hum an populations, and the incidence of cancer increases greatly with age. In the United States, cancer is second only to heart disease as a cause of death, accounting for 22% of all deaths (Fraum eni et al., 1993). In 1998, cancer w as the leading cause of death in A laska, accounting for 25.2% of all Alaska resident deaths (A laska Cancer Registry , 2002). Cancers have increased greatly in Americans in the past 40 years, due to a large increase in life expectancy and to the high incidence of cigarette smoking since the 1940s. In the U nited States, smoking accounts for about 40% of all cancer deaths in men and 11 Risks in Perspective - PCBs about 20% of all cancer deaths in w omen (Fraum eni et al., 1993). PCBs have been classified by the USEPA as probable human carcinogens. If PCBs cause cancer in hum ans, PCB-caused cancers are rare and account for only a tiny to negligible proportion of all cancers. O nly a sm all proportion of cancers are re lated to exposure to hazardous chem icals from the workplace or environm ent (Ames et al., 1995). PCBs and dioxins are know n to cause cancer in laboratory anim als that are experim entally exposed to high doses. The m ore highly chlorinated PCB mixtures cause liver cancer in rodents, probably through a prom otion m echanism (Saf e, 1989). The increased incidence of liver cancer in rodents usually occurs at high doses that are toxic to liver cells (Kociba et al., 1978; Tatem atsu et al., 1979). The m ost toxic dioxin congener, TCD D, acts as a tum or prom oter in laboratory anim als (Pitot et al., 1980) but has weak or no initiation activity (Shu et al., 1987). That is, PCB- and dioxin-like chem icals may \"promote\" the growth of cells that have already been dam aged by a different, initial insult during the first stage of carcinogenesis. Tum or prom otion appears to be m ediated by the A h receptor, and likely results from modifications in horm onal system s involved in cell grow th and differentiation such as the epiderm al grow th factor and estrogen receptor. Coplanar PCBs with dioxin-like activity may act through a similar Ah-mediated tumor prom otion m echanism . The doses of dioxin-like chem icals that were required to induce cancer in experim ental anim als w ere large, and involved an estim ated body burden (in term s of ng TEQ /kg body weight) that w as 100 to 10,000 tim es higher than the background body burdens of TEQ s found in hum ans today (DeVito et al., 1995). A recent analy sis has convincingly show n that hum ans are significantly less susceptible than rats to TCD D-induced carcinogenesis, and that low -level background exposures to TCD D are not associated with an increased cancer risk in hum ans (Aylward et al., 1996). PCBs and dioxins can indirectly modulate the incidence of cancer caused by other chem icals. The induction of phase I and phase II drug-m etabolizing enzy mes can lead to either an increase or a d ecrease in the toxicity of a variety of chem icals. In som e cases, potent carcinogens are metabolized and cleared from the body more rapidly follow ing PCB- or dioxin-induced enzy me induction, or adduct form ation otherw ise reduced, such that dioxin- like chem icals can be protective and act as anti- carcinogens. For exam ple, aflatoxin B1-induced hepatocellular carcinom as in trout can be inhibited by pre-initiation treatm ent with PCBs (Hendricks et al., 1977; Makura et al., 1974; Shelton et al., 1986). Exposure of w omen to high levels of TCD D has also been associated with a slight decrease in the incidence of estrogen-dependent cancers of the breast and uterus (Bertazzi et al., 1993), which could possibly be related to the antiestrogenic properties of TCD D (Safe et al., 1991). A number of epidem iological studies have been perform ed to exam ine the incidence of cancer in human populations that have been accidentally exposed to high levels of PCBs or dioxins (Hardell et al., 1994). In general, it has been difficult to detect statistically significant differences in the incidence of relatively rare form s of cancer betw een P CB- or dioxin-exposed and control populations. V ery large num bers of study subjects are required to detect such changes, because the risk is so low . For exam ple, in a population of 4,824 people exposed to high levels of TCD D during a chem ical plant explosion in Seveso, Italy (Zone B), six cases of hepatobiliary cancer were detected among those who had lived in the zone for at least five years (Bertazzi et al., 1993). This w as a statistically significant increase in incidence from the 2.1 cases expected. Even following the extrem e TCD D exposures experienced in Seveso, detecting a health im pact was difficult because of the rarity of cancer incidence, the small number of exposed individuals, and the short length of follow -up. A num ber of studies have been conducted to assess cancer risk in people w ith occupational PCB or dioxin exposures. In a large study of electric utility workers occupationally exposed to PCBs, m ortality from malignant m elanom a increased monotonically with increasing cum ulative exposure to PCB insulating fluids (Loom is et al., 1997). A separate exam ination of the same cohort did not reveal a significant association between PCB exposure and mortality from prostate cancer (Charles et al., 2003). A recent m eta-analy sis of three cohorts occupationally exposed to dioxin-like compounds revealed an increase in total cancer m ortality associated with a lifetim e intake rate of 7 pg TCDD- TEQ /kg body weight/day , with no 6 pg TEQ /kg body weight/day (Crum p et al., 2003). For comparison, the U.S. EPA estim ates the average current lifetim e hum an exposures to dioxin to be approxim ately 1 pg TEQ /kg/day , with 99% of A mericans being exposed less than 3 pg TEQ /kg body weight/day (Crum p et al., 2003). Exposure to PCBs or dioxins has not been consistently associated with one particular form of cancer, but instead has been associated with different types of cancers in various studies. This observa tion confirm s that if they cause human cancer, PCBs and dioxins are not directed towards one specific target organ, but exert a pleiotropic response that affects the endogenous regulation of cell differentiation and proliferation. H owever, certain types of cancer are m ore com monly associated with PCB or 12 Risks in Perspective - PCBs dioxin exposure, including soft tissue sarcom a, cancers of the hem atopoietic sy stem , and cancers of the liver and extrahepatic biliary system . In hum ans, occupational doses of PCBs or dioxins have been associated with cancer of the liver and extrahepatic biliary system , including the bile ducts and gall bladder (Brow n, 1987). A mong capacitor plant workers the geom etric m ean serum concentration of A roclor 1242 was 1470 ppb versus 6.6 ppb in controls; 5 cancers w ere observed versus 1.9 expected. Liver cancer has also been observed in experim ental anim als treated w ith high doses of TCD D (Kociba et al., 1978). However, PCBs and dioxins are considered to be m inor risk factors for hepatocellular carcinom a (H CC) in com parison to other know n causes. It is estim ated that approxim ately 75% of HCC cases worldwide can be attributed to one of three causes: hepatitis B virus, alcohol, or aflatoxin (a natural product of m old that can contam inate foods) (Falk, 1982). Cancers of the biliary tract are usually associated with the incidence of gall stones, although horm onal, nutritional and genetic factors are also im portant (Fraum eni and K antor, 1982). Limited data suggest that liver and gall bladder cancer rates may be elevated am ong A laskan natives com pared to the overall w hite population of the U nited States (Nutting et al., 1993). It is unlikely that PCB-like chem icals are involved in the etiology of these diseases, because exposures of Alas kan natives to PCBs and dioxins are m uch lower than those experienced by accidentally exposed human populations in which carcinogenic effects have been observed. The higher rate of liver cancer in Alaska Natives relative to the total U.S. population is due to a greater prevalence of hepatitis B infection am ong A laskan N atives (Lanier et al., 1989). It has been hy pothesized that background exposures to organochlorines (such as PCBs or persistent pesticides) may increase the risk of breast cancer (Davis et al., 1993; Krieger, 1989). Many organochlorines have very weak estrogenic or anti-estrogeni c activity , and exposure to endogenous estrogens is a know n risk factor for devel- opment of breast cancer. A num ber of epidem iological studies have been conducted to determ ine whether organochlorine exposure is a significant risk factor for developm ent of breast cancer. Some prelim inary studies with sm all sam ple sizes reported higher organochlorine exposures in breast cancer patients relative to controls (Dewailly et al., 1994a; Falck et al., 1992; Wolff et al., 1993). However, several larger, recent, well designed studies have since show n that organochlorine exposures were not associated with an increased breast cancer risk (Hunter et al., 1997; Safe, 2000). However, one prelim inary report indicated a possible increase in breast cancer risk am ong w omen w ith both elevated organochlorine exposure and a genetic poly morphism of the cytochrom e P4501A 1 gene (Moy sich et al., 1999); further research is needed on this topic. There are a num ber of reasons why a hy pothesized breast cancer/organochlorine exposure link is not plausible (Safe, 1995; Safe, 2000). First, several epidem iological studies of w omen occupationally exposed to relatively high levels of D DT (Higginson, 1985) or PCBs (Brow n, 1987) have not show n a higher incidence of breast cancer. Second, m ost organochl orines are not estrogenic, and the estrogenic activity of the others is very weak. The relative contribution of estrogenic organochlorines to total exogenous estrogen exposure is very small. For exam ple, Safe calculated that, in \u00b5g/day, the birth control pill may contribute 16,675 estrogen equivalents per day , bioflavonoids naturally present in m any foods contribute about 102 estrogen equivalents per day , and environm ental organochlorine estrogens may contribute 0.0000025 estrogen per day (Safe, 1995). Some organochlorines such as TCD D are antiestrogenic, and dietary levels of antiestrogen equivalents (industrial or natural) are significantly higher than the estrogen equivalents of organochlorine pesticides or PCBs (Safe, 1995). Several researchers w ho have recently reviewed the organochlorine/breast cancer literature have reached the same conclusion: in the general population, the weight of evidence does not support a causative association betw een organochlorine exposure and breast cancer (A dami et al., 1995; A hlborg et al., 1995; Laden and H unter, 1998; Safe, 2000). A substantial body of evidence has accum ulated indicating that the incidence of testicular cancer in men has increased significantly since the 1960s (Crisp et al., 1998). There are m arked differences in testicular cancer incidence levels between countries and between races. The incidence level of testicular cancer in Denm ark is particularly high; it is about 5 tim es higher than in Finland. Cry ptorchidism , a condition in w hich one or both testicles have not descended, is a know n risk factor for testicular cancer. It has been suggested that exposure to environm ental contam inants such as organochlorines may cause cryptorchidism and/or testicular cancer, through a process called endocrine disruption (discussed in detail in a later section of this report) (Harrison et al., 1997). The hy pothesis that exposure to organochlorines may be responsible for the observed increase in testicular cancer incidence is not w ell supported, based on several lines of reasoning (Safe, 2000) . First, w hile the overall incidence of testicular cancer has increased in all Scandinavian countries during the last 25-30 y ears, there has been an 80-90% decrease in average breast m ilk DDE concentrations, show ing an inverse relationship between testicular cancer and DDE concentration (Ekbom et al., 1996). Second, the Scandinavian countries do not have m ajor differences in hum an or environm ental concentrations of organochlorines, y et their incidence 13 Risks in Perspective - PCBs levels of testicular cancer ar e dram atically different. The environm ental and lifesty le factors, including diet and occupational exposures, that are responsible for this disease are unknow n and should be investigated (Safe, 2000). Inform ation available to date does not support the existence of a causal relationship betw een PO P exposure and cancer incidence am ong Alaska Natives. In a recent study , no relationship w as observed betw een the incidence of breast cancer a nd serum concentrations of PCBs or other organochlorine chem icals among Alaska Native women (Rubin et al., 1997). H owever, it is important to note that this study had lim ited pow er to detect such a relationship due to its relatively small sample size, and additional research is needed. Immunotoxicity The im mune sy stem may be the m ost sensitive target for PCB and dioxin toxicity in experim ental anim als. The evidence for clinically relevant immunotoxicity in PCB- or dioxin-exposed humans is less consistent (D eVito et al., 1995). H owever, there is concern that low levels of PCBs or dioxins m ay have subtle im munosuppressive effects in exposed humans, m aking them less able to avoid or com bat infecti ous diseases or cancer. Alternatively , an enhanced im mune response could have negative repercussions such an increased incidence of allergic reactions or autoim mune diseases. The im mune system involves a com plex interaction of many cell types and soluble mediators, and im mune responses are tim e- dependent relative to antigen exposure. Immuno- toxicological assessm ents m ust consider these levels of complexity in order to produce interpretable results. A wide variety of im munological endpoints have been studied w ith regard to the toxicity of PCBs and dioxins. Immunosuppressive effects of PCBs and dioxins are largely modulated through the Ah receptor (Kerkvliet, 1994; Silkw orth and rabstein, 1982). The of PCB/dioxin m ixtures are often not additive, as certain PCBs antagonize the im munotoxic effects of other PCBs and dioxins including those of TCD D (Harper et al., 1995). Therefore, the TEQ approach cannot be accurately used to estim ate the im munotoxic potency of PCB/dioxin m ixtures at this tim e (Tryphonas, 1994). Immunotoxic effects have been observed in m arine mammals fed fish from contam inated areas. In a 2.5 year feeding study , captive harbor seals fed fish from the heavily polluted Baltic Sea exhibited an impairm ent of T cell m ediated im mune responses (D e Sw art et al., 1995) and a suppression of natural killer cell activity (Ross et al., 1996) in com parison to seals fed fish from the relatively uncontam inated Atlantic Ocean. Natural killer cells are an im portant first line of defense against viral infections (Golub and G reen, 1991). Consum ption of dioxin-like chem icals w as about ten tim es higher in the Baltic herring-fed than in the Atlantic herring-fed seals (288 ng TEQ and 29 ng TEQ per day respectively ) (Swart et al., 1994), and total TEQ s in the blubber of test subjects follow ing tw o years on the different diets were approxim ately 3.4 times greater in the Baltic than Atlantic-fed seals (Ross et al., 1996). Although these chem icals might have contributed to the im muno- suppression observed, it is possible that other immunosuppressive agents m ay have been present in the fish as well. Consum ption of Baltic Sea fish m ay also affect the human im mune sy stem , since reduced num bers of natural killer cells were found in the blood of 23 adult m ales with high fish consum ption relative to a group of 20 m en who did not eat fish (Svensson et al., 1994). Differences in natural killer cell num bers were sm all, however, and all other im mune sy stem param eters m easured w ere not significantly different betw een the tw o groups. A num ber of constituents that can im pair the activity of natural killer cells were present in the fish and were highly intercorrelated, including m ethyl mercury , PCBs and dioxins, p,p'-D DT, and om ega-3 poly unsaturated fatty acids. Therefore, the specific causative agent of natural killer cell im pairm ent could not be identified. Furtherm ore, the observed differences w ere not likely to have functional significance. It should be emphasized that concentrations of POPs are m uch lower in Alaskan fish than in fish from the highly contam inated Baltic Sea. In one study , concentrations of PCBs and DDTs were ten times low er in cod from the Western Tana Fjord (Barents Sea) than in cod from the Gulf of Finland (Baltic Sea) (Vuorinen et al., 1989). There is som e concern that contam inant-induced immunosuppression m ay have contributed to a number of epizootics in recent y ears am ong seals and dolphins inhabiting polluted coastal waters (Aguilar and Borrell, 1994; Sarokin and Schulkin, 1992). In mice, enhanced susceptibility to influenza virus was observed following a single dose of 10 ng TCD D/kg body weight, m aking viral host resistance the m ost sensitive adverse effect y et reported for TCD D in this species (Burleson et al., 1996). In Europe, a large num ber of m arine m ammals died from infections with m orbillivirus, is hy pothesized that environm ental contam inants may stricken anim als less im munocom petent to fight the disease (Hall et al., 1992). If such trends w ere global in nature, a decrease in m arine mammal populations due to reduced im munocom petence could negatively affect Alaskan natives by reducing their traditional food supply . Fortunately , most A laskan m arine m ammals are not exposed to the sam e degree of contam ination as are 14 Risks in Perspective - PCBs marine m ammals from industrial coastal areas. For exam ple, PCBs in com mon seals from the North and Baltic Seas were 34 tim es higher than PCBs in ringed seals from the arctic island of Spitzbergen (Luckas et al., 1990). Large-scale m arine m ammal epizootics such as those described in Europe and the east coast of the continental U .S. have not been observed in A laska. Different approaches have been used to study immunological endpoints of PCB and dioxin exposure in humans. Endpoints such as the incidence of infections and the response to vaccinations are integrated measurem ents of im mune function that are highly relevant to human health, but they are non-specific to PCB or dioxin exposures. The number and relative quantities of various subsets of immune-related cells (lymphocy tes) can function as specific m arkers of immune function, and they are often quantified in the blood. Im mune cells from PCB- or dioxin-exposed humans can be cultured, and their proliferative response to challenge with specific m itogens or antigens can be assessed. Investigations of the in vitro function of immune cells in culture can diagnose specific aspects of the immune system , but are m ore difficult to relate to in vivo relevance. Most immunological param eters have a very broad range of norm al values, and sm all differences are often not biologically meaningful (Kerkvliet, 1994). Many of the in vitro assay s that have been perform ed w ith im mune cells from PCB- or dioxin-exposed hum ans have produced conflicting results in different studies. There are at least two possible reasons for this. First, in vitro assay s can be greatly influenced by laboratory procedures and culture conditions. For exam ple, w hen 23 commercial lots of serum were tested as com ponents of cell culture m edia for in vitro assays, five of the serum lots supported a suppression of T-dependent hum oral immune response w hile the rem aining lots demonstrated an apparent protective effect against the TCD D exposure (Morris et al., 1991). Second, in vitro studies rem ove the complex influence of non-ly mphoid factors on immune function, such as circulating endocrine horm ones. Endocrine horm ones such as glucocorticoids, sex steroids, thy roxine, grow th horm one and prolactin are involved in the regulation of the immune response, and many of these horm ones are influenced by PCBs and dioxins (K erkvliet, 1994). The in vivo response to an antigen challenge such as sheep red blood cells (SRBD ) can also be m easured. One advantage of this approach is that it integrates the interactions of many immune system s com ponents as w ell as non-ly mphoid factors such as endocrine sy stem . Epidem iological investigations of immunological characteristics have been perform ed in several human populations that were accidentally exposed to relatively high concentrations of PCBs or dioxins. The epidem iological studies were often limited by small sample sizes, and exposures to PCBs and dioxins were often not measured. The studies w ere conducted at very different tim es post-exposure. In som e cases several decades had elapsed between the tim e of exposure and the tim e of evaluation. This could be a problem because immunological param eters could recover over time following an accidental exposure. Representative studies are presented in Table 5, which illustrates only a fraction of the w ide variety of endpoints that have been m easured and the inconsistency of the results obtained am ong various studies. The incidence of infections has been related to accidental PCB, dioxin and/or furan exposures in several human populations. In Taiwanese Yu-Cheng patients acciden- tally exposed to rice oil contam inated w ith PCBs and furans, \"frequent\" infections of the respiratory tract and skin were observed, although the incidence w as not compared w ith a control group (Lu and Wu, 1985). In a follow -up study , Yu-Cheng children exposed prenatally to the contam inated rice oil had a significantly higher incidence of m iddle-ear diseases than did controls, and middle-ear disease incidence was correlated with serum dibenzofuran concentrations (Chao et al., 1997). Sixteen years after the Y u-Cheng incident, no dose-response relationship was found betw een 27 Y u-Cheng children's serum PCB/furan concentrations and any immunologic markers (Yu et al., 1998). Following the accidental release of large quantities of TCDD in Seveso, Italy , an increase in reports of in fectious childhood diseases occurred, but it was thought to be due to increased reporting by doctors rather than to TCD D exposure per se (Pocchiari et al., 1979). Several larger epidem iological studies have recently been conducted in Europe to exam ine the possible relationship betw een immunocom petence and background levels of PCB- and dioxin-like exposures in children. In a population from the N etherlands w ith a relatively high background exposure to PCBs and dioxins, there w as no significant correlation betw een pre- and post-natal exposure to these chem icals and the num ber of infections during the first 18 m o of life, or in vaccination effectiveness in the infant s (Weisglas-Kuperus et al., 1995). In a follow -up study of the same children, plasm a PCB concentrations at 42 m onths were associated with a higher prevalence of recurrent middle-ear infections and chicken pox, and a lower prevalence of allergic reactions (Weisglas-K uperus et al., 2000). In a study of 200 teenagers from Belgium with background PCB/dioxin exposures, dioxin TEQ concentrations in serum were also negatively associated w ith allergic responses to house dust m ites, cat dander and grass pollen (Van Den Heuvel RL, 2002). These results are consistent with a laboratory experim ent in w hich rats exposed to 2,3,7,8- 15 Risks in Perspective - PCBs TCD D exhibited a suppression of allergic im mune responses to house dust m ite allergen (Luebke et al., 2001). The possibility of PCB- or dioxin-induced immunosuppression among the Canadian Inuit w as proposed, related to the incide nce of infectious diseases such as otitis (Julien et al., 1987) and m eningitis (Proulx, 1988). The incidence of these diseases has been m uch greater in infant Inuit from northern Quebec than in infants from other populations, and there has been speculation that PCBs and/or dioxins in Inuit food m ight have been responsible via im munosuppressive m echa- nism s (Dewailly et al., 1989; Dewailly et al., 1993). In a recent study of the Nunavik population, prenatal exposure to som e organochlorines (as m easured in immature breast m ilk of the m other) was associated with an increased risk of developing acute or recurrent otitis media (m iddle-ear infection) (Dewailly et al., 2000). The organochlorines m ost com monly associated with an increased risk of otitis m edia included the pesticides hexachlorobenzene, p,p'-D DE and dieldrin; a statistically significant relationship w ith PCBs w as not observed. Dioxins, furans and coplanar PCBs w ere not measured in the study . A substantial body of scientific evidence reveals that other know n risk factors are actually responsible for the high incidence of otitis media am ong the Inuit. These risk factors for otitis m edia include low socioeconom ic status, fam ily history , house-crow ding, anatom ical factors such as m orphology of the Eustachian tube, exposure to tobacco sm oke, and genetic factors (Infante- Rivard and Fernandez, 1993; Julien et al., 1987; Lim et al., 1998; Stathis et al., 1999). Race m ay be an im portant risk factor for otitis m edia. Historically , American Indians, Canadian Eskim os and N ative Alaskans have experienced a much greater prevalence of otitis m edia than have white children, while black children seem to be at lesser risk than white children (Infante-Rivard and Fernandez, 1993). Confounding factors m ake assignm ent of causality difficult for otitis m edia cases. Breast feeding has been show n in many studies to be a significantly protective factor against the developm ent of otitis m edia (Infante- Rivard and Fernandez, 1993), despite the fact that infants may be exposed to PO Ps in breast m ilk. Also, there are potential confounding im munosuppressive influences within the fish diet itself, such that it would be difficult to separate the influence of POPs. For exam ple, the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids found in fish are potent im munosuppressive agents (Blok et al., 1996; Kelley and D audu, 1993). No clear pattern of PCB- or dioxin-m ediated immunotoxicity in humans has epidem studies (Table 5). Param eters such as the CD4/CD 8 ratio, im munoglobulin levels and lymphocy te proliferation w ere decreased in PCB- and/or dioxin-exposed individuals in som e studies, but increased or unaffected in exposed individuals in other studies. It is also im portant to recognize that the effects of chronic low -level exposures to PCBs or dioxins m ay be fundam entally different from those that occur following accidental high-dose exposures. In marmoset monkey s, the effect of repeated low exposures of TCD D on a T cell subpopulation (helper-inducer or \" memory\" cells) w as the opposite of that w hich occurred at higher exposures (N eubert et al., 1992). Therefore, extrapolations from data obtained at high TCD D dose levels to m uch low er exposur es are probably not justified with respect to im mune system effects, and the \" possible effects induced by high occupational exposures or in victim s of accidents are not necessarily to be expected .... at the m uch low er exposures of the general population\" (Neubert et al., 1992). Reproductive and Deve lopmental Toxicity; \"Endocrine Disruption\" Human reproduction and fetal are regulated by the endocrine sy stem , and involve a com plex interplay of horm onal signals that can produce their effects at minute doses. Chem icals that interfere with the norm al functioning of horm onal signals have been called \"endocrine disruptors\". The developing fetus is considered the most vulnerable and sensitive m ember of the population to endocrine disruption, because horm ones play such a crucial role in fetal developm ent. One important difference betw een exposure to endocrine disruptors during critical peri ods in developm ent versus during adulthood is the irreversibility of an effect during developm ent (Bigsby et al., 1999). Xenobiotic chem icals (that is, chem icals originating from outside the body ) can interfere w ith horm onal signals in a variety of ways. Som e chem icals interact with horm one receptors. At tim es the chem ical interacting with the receptor acts as an agonist, and m imics the horm one to \" turn on\" the receptor and induce biological effects. In other cases the chem ical interacting with the receptor acts as a horm one antagonist. Effectively , it does not \" turn on\" the receptor but instead blocks the horm one from the receptor site, such that the horm one can not carry out its intended function (Klinge et al., 1992). Xenobiotics can also interfere w ith signals by altering the production, m etabolism or clearance kinetics of horm ones, or by influencing the regulation of horm one receptor levels. It has long been recognized that exposure to som e xenobiotic chem icals can interfere w ith horm onal signals and result in adverse consequences (Birnbaum , 1994). Some plants found in nature produce chem icals that can cause sterility in the livestock or wildlife that consum e 16 Risks in Perspective - PCBs them (Cheeke and Shull, 1985). A lso, the drug diethy lstilbestrol (DES) pr oduced vaginal cancer and other abnorm alities of the reproductive organs in fem ale offspring of m others w ho took the drug during pregnancy (Herbst, 1981). These adverse outcom es w ere not expressed until the daughters reached puberty . This drug is a potent m imic of the fem ale horm one 17--estradiol, and it produced its negative effects by altering the delicate horm onal balance of sex horm ones in the womb during the critical period for sexual differentiation and developm ent. More recently, environm ental contam inants have been implicated as one of the causes of reproductive abnor- malities in wildlife. Severe developm ental abnorm alities of the reproductive sy stem were observed among hatchling alligators from a pesticide-contam Florida lake, including abnorm al gonadal morphology al sex steroid concentrations, elevated neonatal mortality , and significantly reduced phallus size in m ale juveniles (Guillette, 1995). Low fem ale reproductive activity and success w ere observed in belugas from the St. Law rence Estuary in Canada, along w ith reproductive tissue disorders such as ovarian tum ors and m astitis (Beland et al., 1993). Beluga blubber from the St. Lawrence estuary population w as found to contain very high concentrations of PCBs and organochlorine pesticides (Martineau et al., 1987; Muir et al., 1990), as well as PAHs and heavy metals. Environm ental contam inants are a suspected cause of the St. Lawrence beluga's reproductive and other health problem s (De Guise et al., 1995), although som e feel the problem has been overstated, and population estim ates and cancer rates for St. Lawrence beluga are controversial (Ham mill et al., 2003; K ingsley , 1998). Hermaphrodism (a full set of both male and female sexual organs) and pseudoherm aphrodism (ambiguity only in the external or internal genitalia, but not the gonads) have been docum ented in several arctic m arine mammal individuals. A true herm aphrodite w as dis- covered in the St. Law rence beluga population (D e Guise et al., 1994), and four fem ale pseudoherm aphrodite polar bears were recorded at Svalbard (Wiig et al., 1998). Relatively high organochlorine concentrations have been measured in both of those populations, and organochlorine-induced endocrine disruption has been suggested as a potential cause of the abnorm alities. Two male bowhead whales taken by subsistence hunters near Barrow , Alaska w ere also classified as pseudo- herm aphrodites (O'Hara et al., 2002). It contam inants caused pseudoherm aph- rodism in the organochlorine concentrations are quite low in that filter-feeding species (Table 3). The process of sexual differentiation is particularly sensitive to horm one alterations. The differentiation of sex organs from bipotential gonadal tissue occurs during early prenatal developm ent and is determ ined by the milieu of sex horm ones present during a critical period (Crew s et al., 1995; Loom is, 1986). In experim ental anim als, sexual differentiation of the brain and m any aspects of adult sexual behavior are also determ ined by sex horm ones present in the w omb during finite critical periods of developm ent. For exam ple, early sex horm one administration can have profound perm anent sex reversing effects on adult behavior in birds (A dkins- Regan, 1987). When m ale Japanese quail em bryos are injected with 1 \u00b5g estradiol or 500 \u00b5g testosterone during a critical period of incubation, they can be completely behaviorally sex reversed. A s adults they fail to m ount, crow, or strut; they are com pletely dem asculinized and are behaviorally indistinguishable from females (A dkins, 1979). This effect is due to a fundam ental change in the neural substrate underly ing behavior. Recently there has been great concern that environm ental contam inants, including PCBs and dioxins, m ay \"disrupt\" the endocrine sy stem and cause deleterious reproductive and developm ental effects in exposed wildlife and humans (Birnbaum , 1994; Brouw er et al., 1995; Brouw er et al., 1999; Harrison et al., 1997). Although m uch attention has been paid to the \"estrogenic\" activity of various xenobiotic chem icals (perhaps due to the m odel toxicity display ed by DES), this is an overly simplistic approach to the issue. Chem icals m ay have estrogenic, anti-estrogenic, androgenic or anti-androgenic activities, which can by different m echanism s each alter the effective horm onal milieu in the wom b (Crisp et al., 1998). TCDD and structurally related chem icals displayed anti-estrogenic properties in hum an breast cancer cells (K rishnan and Safe, 1993). The com plex m ixture of estrogenic and anti- estrogenic chem icals humans are exposed to through the environm ent and diet m ay be contra-active, and result in an insignificant overall effect (Safe, 1994a). A more holistic approach to the problem of PO P-induced endocrine disruption recognizes the profound interdependence of horm ones, other soluble factors and immune sy stem param eters in the body . Through alterations in gene expression PCBs and dioxins can influence a wide variety of horm ones and soluble regulatory factors and alter the com munication betw een cells, possibly by influencing gap junctions (Trosko et al., 1981). They therefore have the ability to influence reproduction and developm ent not only by mimicking or blocking sex horm one activity , but also by altering processes of cell differentiation and grow th during critical periods. It is necessary to consider several factors when evaluating the potential for xenobiotics to interfere w ith the endocrine system . The potency of the xenobiotic and 17 Risks in Perspective - PCBs the tim ing of the exposure at the relevant target cell or organ are both crucial. Th e dram atic disruption of a process such as sexual differentiation can only happen during a very limited tim e period, w hich m ay only last a few days. The nature of the exposure can greatly influence the effect observed. Som e horm ones are only active when presented as pulses, while slow steady exposures are not active (G angong, 1985). Due to the complexity of the biological sy stem s involved, inform ation obtained from in vitro screening assays (for exam ple, for estrogen receptor binding) should be interpreted with caution until the chem ical in question has been confirm ed to produce reproductive or developm ental toxicity in vivo using realistic exposure concentrations and scenarios. Endocrine disruptive potency and the nature of dose/response relationships are critical to understanding potential effects. Many of the pesticides that have been termed \" estrogenic\" exhibit activity that is at least a thousand-fold weaker than endogenous estradiol, and very high doses of the pesticides w ere required to elicit observable estrogenic effects in experim ental anim als (Eroschenko, is m to the quantity of \" natural\" estrogens produced by the body or consum ed in food, and under m ost conditions it is unlikely that trace contam inants could contribute significantly to the body 's estrogen balance (Safe, 1995). However, there is som e evidence that endocrine disruption effects do not alw ays display a monotonic dose-response relationship (m onotonic m eans that as the dose increases, the response either increases or stay s the same) (Bigsby et al., 1999; vom Saal and Sheehan, 1998; Welshons et al., 2003). For exam ple, high doses of estrogens inhibited an effect (enlargem ent of the fetal mouse prostate) that was stim ulated by much low er doses, dem onstrating an inverted U -shaped dose- response curve (vom Saal et al., 1997). In an in vitro bioassay several natural phy toestrogens w ere anti- estrogenic at low concentrations (via arom inhibition), but at high concentrations, exhibiting U-shaped curves (A lmstrup et al., 2002). These experim ents dem onstrate the of perform ing dose-response assessm ents for endocrine disruptors across a w ide range of doses, from levels encountered in the environm ent through doses that produce acute toxicity . Since standard toxicity testing protocols call for in vivo testing at maximum tolerable dosages (Daston et al., 1997), over ty pically a maximum of a 50-fold dosage range, they may be inadequate to characterize relevant low -dose endocrine disruptive effects (Bigsby et al., 1999). Dioxins have exhibited reproductive and/or developm ental toxicity in several anim al m odels (Theobald and Peterson, 1994). For exam ple, in the rat a single m aternal oral dose of TCD D on day 15 of gestation resulted in an im pairm ent of several reproductive param eters in m ale offspring. Maternal doses as low as 0.16 \u00b5g TCD D/kg body weight produced significant dose-related delay s in testicular descent, decreases in sem inal vesicle and ventral prostate w eights at several stages of sexual developm ent (Mably et al., 1992c), and sexual behavior during adulthood was demasculinized in m ale offspring (Mably et al., 1992b). Decreases in epididym is and cauda epididym is weight, daily sperm production, and caudal epididy mal sperm number w ere observed at the low est maternal dose tested (0.064 \u00b5g TCD D/kg body weight) (Mably et al., these alterations, reproductive outcom es of matings betw een the m ale offspring and control female rats w ere not significantly impaired during this study , even at the highest dose tested (1.0 \u00b5g TCD D/kg body weight) (Mably et al., 1992a). Endpoints related to reproduction have been investigated in human m ales exposed to PCBs, dioxins and/or furans. Some sperm quality deficits were observed in Yu-Cheng males exposed to PCBs and PCD Fs relative to controls, including abnorm al m orphology , oligosperm ia, and reduced oocy te penetration (Hsu et al., 2003). It has been reported that sperm counts have dram atically decreased in humans during the past 50 y ears throughout the w orld (Carlsen et al., 1992), and it w as suggested that environm ental contam inants m ight be to blam e (Colborn et al., 1996). It has sim ilarly been noted that testicular abnorm alities have increased in recent decades, and might also have an environm ental cause (Giwercm an et al., 1993). Endocrine-m odulating chem icals such as POPs are often im plicated as possible culprits of m ale reproductive toxicity in the literature (Colborn et al., 1996). The evidence in support of PO P-induced sperm count declines is, how ever, nonexistent. There is serious debate as to w hether a decline in sperm count has even occurred (Brom wich et al., 1994; Lipshultz, 1996). Sperm counts vary dram atically among geographic areas, and many of the differences originally detected w ere related to geographic location rather than to tim e (Fisch and G oluboff, 1996; Paulsen et al., 1996). Several studies have investigated the effect of TCD D exposure on testosterone and gonadotropin concentra- tions in hum an serum . Testosterone concentrations were lower in industrial workers exposed to TCD D than in a reference population, while luteinizing (LH ) and follicle-stim were higher in the TCD D-exposed workers than in the reference population (Egeland et al., 1994). The horm one differences m easured w ere of no biological significance, as the m agnitude of the m easured horm one differences was very sm all. Prim ary gonadal failure w as not involved, because low testosterone and high LH and FSH 18 Risks in Perspective - PCBs were not observed in the sam e individuals. The w orkers in that study had rather high concentrations of TCD D in serum (63% had concentrations above 33.3 ppt). Testosterone and gonadotropins w ere m easured in another group of TCD D-exposed m ales, the Ranch Hand veterans involved in herbicide application in Vietnam (Henriksen et al., 1996). In that cohort TCD D body burdens w ere low er (only 26% had TCD D concentrations above 33.3 ppt in serum ), and no consistent or meaningful associations betw een TCD D and horm one concentrations w ere found. In a related study of the Ranch Hand veterans, an association betw een paternal dioxin concentrations and reproductive outcom es such as birth defects and developm ental disabilities was not apparent (Wolfe et al., 1995). Several epidem iological studies of dioxin-exposed cohorts have docum ented apparent sex ratio skew s in their offspring, w ith an abnorm ally low proportion of male babies born. The m echanism for a possible sex-ratio skew is unknow n, although a m odification of horm onal balance m ay be involved. A differential ovopathy mechanism has also been suggested (Jongbloet et al., 2002). A sex ratio skew was noted in the offspring of the Seveso population, who w ere exposed to high concentrations of TCDD following an industrial accident (Mocarelli et al., 1996). High TCDD exposure in both parents, as m easured in serum sam ples collected the year of the accident, was associated with an excess of fem ale offspring. In the 74 total births occurring in the \" A-zone\" during the first 7 years after the accident, 26 were males and 48 w ere fem ales. This ratio declined (60 males vs 64 females) in the y ears from 1985 to 1994 and was no longer significant. Further study of the Seveso cohort revealed that the effect was associated with paternal, not maternal, TCDD exposure (Mocarelli et al., 2000). Similarly , a recent study of an occupationally -exposed cohort in Russia docum ented an excess of female children associated with their fathers' exposure to dioxins (Ryan et al., 2003). The sex ratio w as norm al in offspring of TCD D-exposed mothers, but for 150 fathers exposed to dioxins at the pesticide production plant, the subsequent sex ratio of offspring w as 0.38 males/(total males + females) (the norm al ratio is 0.51). H owever, a sex ratio skew was not observed in offspring of a large occupationally -exposed U .S. cohort of fathers (Schnorr et al., 2001). Several lines of evidence point to an association between endom etriosis and exposure to dioxin-like com pounds (Birnbaum and Cum mings, 2002). Endom etriosis is characterized by the grow th and proliferation of endom etrial cells at sites outside the uterus, and occurs exclusively in menstruating species. Both m ild and severe form s are associated with infertility and chronic pain. O ne study involving chronic, low-level exposure of rhesus m onkey s to TCD D detected an elevated and dose-related incidence of m oderate to severe endom etriosis in m onkey s from both dioxin treatm ent groups (Rier et al., 1993). This negative outcom e was discovered over seven y ears after term ination of dioxin treatm ent, w hen several m onkey s died from fulm inating endom etriosis. In the sam e experim ent, com promised reproductive outcom es were observed in the high dose group (25 parts per trillion in food for four years) (Bow man et al., 1989). A lthough five of eight fem ales in that group conceived, only one gave birth to a viable infant. Unlike dioxin, PCBs do not appear to cause endom etriosis. In a recent reproductive toxicology study , ingestion of PCB A roclor 1254 did not increase the incidence or severity of endom etriosis in rhesus monkey s (Arnold et al., 1996). More research is needed to definitively determ ine whether dioxin exposure is a risk factor for endom etriosis in hum ans (Birnbaum and Cum mings, 2002). Reproductive outcom es in hum ans have been assessed for relationships with PO P exposure. Exposure to PO Ps was often not adequately measured in study subjects in these epidem iological studies (Sw eeney , 1994). The possible relationship between fetal m ortality and POP exposure has been exam ined in several studies. Many early resorptions occur prior to the clinical recognition of pregnancies, w hich m akes it very difficult to quantify any early -stage m ortality that m ight be associated with POP exposure. The contam ination of the Michigan food supply with poly brominated bipheny ls in the m id-1970's did not have a detectable im pact on the rate of late spontaneous abortions (after 20 w eeks gestation) (Humble and Speizer, 1984). In New York state, consum ption of Lake O ntario fish that contained PCBs and other environm ental contam inants w as not associated with an increased risk of spontaneous fetal death (Mendola et al., 1995). Several studies have reported an association betw een POP exposures and altered sexual maturation in pubertal children. A mong Y u-Cheng children exposed in utero to PCBs and PCD Fs, girls w ere significantly shorter, and boys aged 11 to 14 had a significantly shorter penis length, com pared to their m atched controls (Guo et al., 1993). In Belgium , PCB exposure has been associated with delay ed genital developm ent in boy s, while dioxin exposure has been associated w ith delay ed breast developm ent in girls (H ond et al., 2002). The children in the Belgian study were only exposed to background PO P levels. Wom en who w ere exposed to TCD D as pre- pubertal children in the Seveso, Italy industrial accident may have experienced altered m enstrual cycles as adults. For w omen who had been pre-m enarcheal at the time of the explosion, a 10-fold increase in serum TCDD concentration was associated with an increase in menstrual cycle length of alm ost 1 day (Eskenazi et al., 2002). 19 Risks in Perspective - PCBs Birth size and gestational age have also been exam ined in relation to POP exposure, because decreased prenatal grow th has been observed in anim als treated with TCD D (Theobald and Peterson, 1994). Sm all decreases in gestational age (6.6 day s) were noted among female workers occupationally exposed to PCBs (Tay lor et al., 1984). Birthw eights were also reduced in infants born to the occupationally exposed w omen, but m ost of that reduction w as explained by the decreased gestational age. A n association betw een PCB exposure and decreased infant birth w eight w as also observed in a population of wom en who consum ed large quantities of Lake Michigan fish (Fein et al., 1984), but the influence of other chem icals present in the fish could not be adequately determ ined due to the low resolution analy tical m ethodology employed. In a population in North Carolina w ith background PCB exposure, there was no relationship observed betw een PCB concentrations in m aternal m ilk fat at birth and infant birth w eight (Rogan et al., 1986). Hydroxy lated PCB m etabolites can disrupt thyroid horm one and vitam in A hom eostasis, w hich can affect many aspects of m etabolism and prenatal developm ent. The effects of PCBs on fetal and neonatal grow th and developm ent m ay be related to thyroid regulation (Feeley , 1995), although the relationship betw een thyroid horm one concentrations and PCB exposure has been inconsistent am ong studies of hum an infants (Koopm an- Esseboom et al., 1994b; N agayama al., 1993). a thy one-like affinity for the serum transport protein transthy retin (TTR) (Cheek et al., 1999). Transthy retin is involved in the transport of vitam in A (retinol) to target tissues, and is also a carrier of thy roid horm ones. When hydroxy lated PCBs bind to TTR, unbound vitam in A is cleared from the body rather than being delivered to target tissues, and plasm a concentrations of vitam in A drop rapidly (Brouw er and V an D en Berg, 1986). Similarly , serum thyroxine (T4) plasm a concentrations drop droxy lated PCBs com pete with T4 for TTR binding (Brouw er and V an Den Berg, 1986). Treatm ent of rats with 2,3,7,8-TCDD also induced an increased mobilization of retinoids from storage sites into serum , accom panied by an enhanced elim ination via the kidney into the urine (Brouw er et al., 1989). When vitam in A homeostasis is disturbed in this m anner, vitam in A storage in the liver is ultim ately reduced. Vitam in A plays an im portant role in reproduction, prenatal developm ent, and disease resistance, and many toxic symptoms of PCB exposure resem ble those of vitam in A deficiency (Murk et al., 1998). In European otters environm entally exposed to PCBs, otters with an internal dose of more than 2 ng TCD D-TEQ s/g lipid had strongly reduced hepatic retinoid concentrations, w hich coincided with a higher incidence of infectious diseases (Murk et al., 1998). Recently , som e brom inated flam e retardant metabolites were found to bind to hum an TTR in vitro with greater affinity than did thy roxin (T4), suggesting that they may affect thyroid horm one in vivo similar to hy droxy lated PCBs (Meerts et al., 2000). In conclusion, exposure of hum ans to high levels of PCBs, dioxins and/or furans follow ing industrial accidents or severe poisoning incidents has resulted in some adverse reproductive outcom es. Skin discoloration and ey e discharge w ere observed in infants born to women who consum ed PCB- and furan-contam inated rice oil during the Y usho and Y u-Cheng poisoning incidents (H su et al., 1994; Masuda, 1994). Follow ing the Yu-Cheng incident in Taiw an, children exposed to PCBs and furans in utero exhibited increased abnorm alities of the gum s, skin, nails, teeth and lungs, as well as developm ental delay s and reduced cognitive function, relative to controls (Rogan et al., 1988). O ther adverse outcom es are less w ell docum ented but may have occurred follow ing these extrem e exposures, including increased rates of spontaneous abortion, stillbirths and birth defects. On the other hand, low level, background exposures such as those experienced in the Arctic are not likely to present a significant risk to human reproductive outcom es. Epidem iological studies focused on fish-eaters or others w ith background PO P exposures have not show n consistent results, and any effects observed have been very minor. Neurotoxicity PCB-like chem icals have caused a num ber of changes in the neurochem istry and neurobehavioral developm ent of laboratory anim als. Interestingly , it appears that m any of the neurotoxicological effects of PCBs m ay not be regulated by interaction with the Ah receptor. In fact, many of the neurotoxicological effects have been attributed to the non-A h active PCB congeners that have chlorine atom s at tw o or more ortho positions. While TCD D and coplanar congeners have been observed to affect the nervous system , the effects are qualitatively and quantitatively different from those caused by PCB mixtures (Schantz and Widholm , 2001; Seegal and Schantz, 1994b). In this important respect, the neurotoxicity of PCBs, dioxins and related chem icals is quite different from other endpoints of toxicity that have been previously discussed. Feeding studies w ith non-hum an prim ate adults and rodent adults have dem onstr ated that ortho-substituted PCB congeners can cross the blood-brain barrier and induce changes in the concentration and activity of the neurotransm itter dopam ine in the brain (Seegal et al., 1991; Seegal et al., 1994). The relationship betw een PCB exposure and dopam ine concentrations is com plex, and appears to be dependent upon the m agnitude of the dose, the age at exposure, and perhaps the com position of the 20 Risks in Perspective - PCBs PCB m ixture. For exam ple, adult nonhum an prim ates fed 3.2 mg Aroclor 1016/kg body weight daily for 20 w eeks exhibited a decrease in brain dopam ine (Seegal et al., 1994), while fem ale rats born to m others fed 100 ppm Aroclor 1016 exhibited an increase in brain dopam ine and other neurotransm itters (Seegal and Schantz, 1994b). Some studies with rats have shown that ortho-substituted PCB congeners reduce brain dopam ine concentrations in both the adult and developing nervous system s, while coplanar, dioxin-like congeners are active only during developm ent (Brouw er et al., 1995). It has been hypothesized that PCBs m ay cause deficits in spatial learning and m emory by altering dopam ine input to the dorsolateral area of the prefrontal cortex (Seegal and Schantz, 1994b). PCBs are also suspected of causing neurotoxic effects via other mechanism s. Som e ortho-substituted congeners cause acute neuronal cell death in cerebellar granule cells (Carpenter et al., 1997; K odavanti and Tilson, 1997), perhaps by interfering w ith calcium hom eostasis (Kodavanti et al., 1996). Exposure of rats to PCB 153 has also been found to reduce long-term potentiation in the hippocam pal area of the brain, w hich m ay adversely affect learning ability (Hussain et al., 2000). Others suspect that endocrine disruption and horm onal factors may play an im portant role in PCB neurotoxicity (Brouw er et al., 1999; Porterfield and H endry, exam ple, sim ilar detrim ents in auditory -evoked potentials can hy pothy roidism and by perinatal exposure to PCB-like chem icals. In one important experim ent, hearing deficits induced in rats perinatally exposed to PCBs appeared to be directly linked to alterations in the thy roid horm one system (Goldey et al., 1995). Animal behavioral studies have been undertaken to determ ine the functional significance of PCB- and dioxin-induced changes in the nervous sy stem . It is clear from laboratory anim al studies that developm ental exposure to PCB mixtures or ortho-substituted PCB congeners results in long-lasting deficits in learning and memory (Schantz and Widholm , 2001). Spatial learning and memory are particularly im paired by ortho- substituted PCB congeners. In contrast, anim als exposed to dioxin or coplanar P CBs often exhibit im proved perform ance on spatial learning tasks, but are im paired on object learning tasks (Seegal and Schantz, 1994a). In general, the cognitive effects of dioxins and coplanar PCBs are lim ited in scope, with the prim ary effect being an im provem ent in w orking memory (Schantz and Widholm , 2001). In a series of experim ents in w hich m onkey s were exposed perinatally to either TCD D or PCBs, learning was im pacted in both cases but in qualitatively different ways (Seegal and Schantz, 1994b). Monkey s born to mothers fed 1.0 ppm Aroclor 1016 exhibited impaired spatial discrim ination-reversal learning but facilitated object discrim ination-reversal learning (Schantz et al., 1989), w hile the exact opposite effect w as observed in monkey s born to m others fed 5 ppt TCD D (Bow man et al., 1990; Schantz and Bowm an, 1989). In addition, monkey s born to m others fed 2.5 ppm Aroclor 1248 exhibited im paired perform ance on delay ed spatial alternation tests at 4 to 6 y ears of age, although they had not been exposed since they were weaned at 4 m onths of age (Levin et al., 1988). In contrast, these deficits were not seen in TCD D-exposed monkey s (Seegal and Schantz, 1994b). Clear im pairm ents of spatial learning w ere also seen in 3 to 4-year-old monkey s that had been exposed to a PCB mixture from birth to 20 w eeks of age, which was form ulated to represent the PCBs ty pically found in human breast m ilk (Rice, 1997; Rice and H ayward, 1997). Those results are of particular concern because exposure w as to an environm entally relevant PCB mixture, and fat and blood PCB concentrations in the exposed monkey s were similar to those ty pically found in hum an populations. Im paired spatial learning has also been observed in ortho PCB-e xposed rats (Schantz et al., 1995b), but not in coplanar PCB-exposed rats (Rice, 1999; Schantz ents in nonspatial, cue-based discrim ination-reversal learning (object learning) have been observed in dioxin-exposed rats (Seo et al., 1999) and m onkey s (Seegal and Schantz, 1994a). Recently, the brom inated flam e retardants was investigated (Eriksson et al., 2001). N eonatal m ice were exposed to a single oral dose of either poly brominated dipheny l ether (PBD ) on postnatal day 10. The anim als were then subjected to several neurobehavioral tests at 2 and 4 m onths of age. Exposure to TBBPA did not cause any significant change in perform ance. However, exposure to PBD E 99, and to a lesser degree PBD E 47, affected spontaneous behavior, habituation capability , and learning and m emory in adult mice. These effects were induced at doses sim ilar to those used in PCB studies, and the anim als' w eight gain was not affected. Several large epidem iological studies have been undertaken in an attem pt to determ ine w hat effect PCB- and dioxin-like exposure m ay have on the neurological system of exposed hum ans. These efforts have largely focused on the neurological developm ent and cognitive functioning of children exposed in utero to PCBs, dioxins and/or furans. In the Y u-Cheng poisoning incident in Taiwan, children that received high doses of heat-degraded PCBs and dibenzofurans in utero display ed a significant decrease in cognitive function when compared with matched controls (Chen et al., 1992). Yu-Cheng children scored approxim ately 5 points 21 Risks in Perspective - PCBs lower than controls on several standard intelligence tests, an effect that rem ained c onsistent during y early tests from 2.5 to 7 y ears of age. In contrast to the Yu-Cheng study of a highly exposed population, several other neurodevelopm ent studies have focused on children exposed to low er, background concentrations of PCBs and dioxins. In one series of studies, the m aternal consum ption of fish from Lake Michigan w as found to be associated with impaired intellectual function in young children (Jacobson et al., 1990; Jacobson et al., 1992; Jacobson and Jacobson, 1996; Jacobson et al., 1985). This impairm ent was attributed to in utero exposure to PCBs from the fish. The m aternal consum ption of fish from Lake Ontario was also associated with neonatal behavioral test deficits in offspring, although the causative agent in the fish w as not identified (Lonky et al., 1995). In another study , the relationship betw een background PCB exposure and neurodevelopm ent was exam ined in children from North Carolina (Gladen et al., 1988; Rogan and G laden, 1991). Estim ated prenatal exposures to PCBs w ere associated w ith decreased psychomotor scale scores at 6, 12, 18 and 24 m onths of age. Various epidem iology studies have produced inconsistent results regarding w hether PO P exposures from breastfeeding are associated with neurological deficits in children. In both the Lake Michigan and North Carolina cohorts, neurological deficits were not associated w ith PO P exposure from breastfeeding. In fact, in a sm all cohort from the N etherlands, perinatal exposure to background dioxin levels w as associated with enhanced neurom otor m aturation (Ilsen et al., 1996). In a large D utch study , prenatal exposure to PCBs and dioxin w as not associated with neurological developm ent, w hile post-natal exposure to PCBs and dioxins from breast feeding was associated with reduced neurological optim ality and hy potonia in neonates (Huism an et al., 1995). H owever, in a follow -up study at 42 months age, cognitive perform ance in the sam e Dutch children was negatively correlated with in utero PCB exposure, but lactational and current PCB exposures had no effect on cognitive functioning (Patandin et al., 1999). In fact, the D utch children w ho were breast-fed perform ed better on cognitive tests than did their form ula-fed counterparts, suggesting that substances in breast milk or factors associ ated with breast-feeding m ay have counteracted any negative influence of prenatal PCB exposure on cognitive developm ent (Patandin et al., 1999). A study of 171 mother-infant pairs in Germany found that prenatal PCB exposure, and to a lesser extent postnatal PCB exposure thr ough breastfeeding, both had a negative im pact on m ental and m otor developm ent betw een 7 and 42 m onths of age (Walkow iak et al., 2001). However, the quality of the home environm ent had a stronger effect on neurodevelopm ent than did PCB exposure, such that the positive im pact of a quality home environm ent could counteract the slight negative effects attributed to neonatal PCB exposure. Although the developing fetus is m ost sensitive to the neurological effects of PCBs, other people may also be at risk of adverse effects. In a recentudy of older, frequent Great Lakes fish consum ers, PCB exposure during adulthood w as associated w ith impairm ents of certain aspects of memory and learning (Schantz et al., 2001). Other contam inants in the fish, including D DE, mercury , and lead, did not appear to have any negative im pact on cognitive functioning. Interestingly , in another cohort exposed to m ultiple contam inants through seafood consum ption, PCBs w ere not found to be the principle contam inant correlated with observed neurobehavioral defic its. In a study of 7-y ear- old children from the Faroe Islands, prenatal exposure to methylmercury was m ore strongly associated w ith neurobehavioral decrem ents than w as prenatal exposure to PCBs (G randjean et al., 2001). H owever, the researchers found that PCBs m ight possibly augm ent the slight neurobehavioral deficits seen at increased levels of methylmercury exposure. Sim ilarly , in a separate cohort from the Faroe Islands, increased methylm ercury exposures w ere associated w ith slightly decreased neurologic optim ality scores in neonates, while PCB exposures had no effect (Steuerw ald et al., 2000). Epidem iological studies that explore the relationships betw een neurological developm ent and PCB exposure must be evaluated with a great deal of caution (Kimbrough, 1997). Most of the studies perform ed to date have had m ethodological problem s. In the Lake Michigan and North Carolina studies, the quantitation of PCB exposure was weak. A lthough m aternal serum , cord blood and breast m ilk w ere collected in these studies, analytical data were not available for m any samples and PCB concentrations w ere often estim ated. Analytical methods were crude (low resolution packed- colum n chrom atography ), individual congeners w ere not quantified, and detection lim its w ere too high to enable quantification of the trace concentrations of PCBs present in m any sam ples. In these early studies the lipid content of serum was not considered when PCB concentrations w ere evaluated, although this is an important determ inant of PCB concentrations in biological tissues (Phillips et al., 1989). Variability of quantitation at low concentrations of PCBs is a fundam ental problem in the early studies, and the small differences of PCB concentration m easured (or merely estim ated!) w ere probably meaningless (K imbrough, 1997). The Lake Michigan study was further w eakened by an inadequate explanation of methodology , possible selection bias, and inadequate control of possible 22 Risks in Perspective - PCBs confounding factors (Middaugh and Egeland, 1997). Another problem com mon to m ost of the epidem iological studies was the inability to rule out the influence of other chem icals or environm ental factors that m ight have been correlated w ith exposure to PCBs. In conclusion, the epidem iological evidence for neurodevelopm ental toxicity follow ing background exposure to PCBs or dioxins is weak. The w eight of the evidence suggests that exposure to low levels of PCBs or dioxins (or an environm ental correlate) m ight possibly be associated with a slight detrim ent to neurological developm ent in infants, but due to the m ethodological difficulties inherent to epidem iological studies this link may never be conclusively dem onstrated. Severe neurological effects have never been observed in children in any epidem iological study that has investigated POP exposures at levels com parable to those encountered by Alaskans through the m arine food chain. Furtherm ore, several factors have been found to have a positive effect on cognitive developm ent that can outw eigh any slight negative influence of PCB exposure, including the healthful practice of breastfeeding and the provision of a positive, nurturing hom e environm ent. Epidemiological Studies relat ed to Human Health and PCBs in the Arctic There is concern for the welfare of hum ans that consum e large quantities of anim als from the top of aquatic food chains, due to their potential exposure to PCBs and other bioaccum ulative contam inants. Som e indigenous peoples from the Arctic consum e large quantities of fish and/or marine m ammals, and these organism s have the potential to bioaccum iological studies have been conducted to assess possible hum an health effects of POPs in the Arctic specifically . This is due to logistical difficulties such as the clim ate, sm all population sizes, the rem oteness of com munities, confounding social and behavioral factors, and the difficulty of extrapolating Western scientific m ethods to unique A rctic cultures. However, several smaller-scale studies have been conducted to assess the hum an health implications of PCBs and dioxins in the arctic environm ent; these are presented below . Breast Cancer A recent study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control, the Alaska Native Health Board and the Alaska Area Native Health Service determ ined the concen- trations of PCBs and other organochlorines in the serum of 126 Alaska Native women (Rubin et al., 1997). The concentrations of environm ental chem icals found in the serum of breast cancer patients were com pared with the concentrations observed in women without breast cancer. The mean year of serum collection w as 1985, and the serum was banked 3-8 y ears prior to breast cancer diagnosis. The m ean serum concentration of PCBs found in the 126 wom en was 4.6 parts per billion (ppb), with 17.7 ppb being the highest individual value. A fter accounting for other risk factors for breast cancer in Alaska N atives, no relationships betw een breast cancer incidence and exposure to environm ental chem icals were observed in this study . This study was an excellent prelim inary effort to exam ine possible relationships betw een exposure to orga nochlorines and disease incidence in Alaskans, and m ore research is needed in this area. Immune System Function The relationship betw een organochlorine exposure and infectious disease incidence was investigated in Inuit infants from Nunavik (Arctic Quebec) (Dewailly et al., 2000). The occurrence of selected infectious diseases was docum ented during the first y ear of life for 171 participating new borns. O rganochlorine analy sis (10 PCB congeners and 8 pesticides) w as perform ed on breast m ilk early in lactation for 94 of those infants, as a measure of prenatal expos ure. Breastfeeding w as a protective risk factor for severa l diseases in this study , as the 98 breast-fed infants experienced few er episodes of several infectious diseases during the first y ear of life than did the 73 bottle-fed infants. This is consistent with a large body of scientific evidence docum enting the protection breastfeeding pr ovides against infection (Oddy, 2001). While the research did not show an association between PCB exposure and infectious disease, the researchers did report a greater relative risk of acute otitis m edia (m iddle ear infection) in infants w ith higher prenatal exposures to several other organochlorines (the pesticides hexachlo- robenzene, DDE and dieldrin) (Dewailly et al., 2000). However, several im portant m ethodological problem s with the study m ake it inadvisable to place too much weight on these findings. Most im portantly , the researchers failed to control for critical confounding factors, especially smoking. The study did not collect any inform ation on maternal sm oking, despite the fact that smoking is a very important risk factor for otitis media in children (Stathis et al., 1999). Other methodological issues included inadequate diagnostic criteria for acute otitis media, and likely inconsistencies in disease diagnosis am ong m ultiple practitioners. Cytochrom e P450-1A1 enzym e activity Cytochrom e P450-1A 1 (CY P1A1) activity is increased follow ing exposure to PCBs or dioxins. CYP1A1- mediated ethoxy resorufin o-deethy lase (EROD) activity is a convenient and sensitive biom arker often used to assess w hether PCB or dioxin exposure is affecting biochem ical function (Safe, 1990). Placenta collected 23 Risks in Perspective - PCBs from Inuit w omen giving birth in A rctic Q uebec in 1995 did not exhibit PCB- or dioxin-m ediated elevated ERO D activity in com parison to wom en from Southern Quebec (Ayotte, 1996). Elevation of ERO D activity is a sensitive subclinical response to PCB or dioxin exposure, and the fact that the \" PCB body burden of Inuit w omen may not be high enough to induce ERO D activity \" indicates that their PCB/dioxin exposure has not been extrem e, and is of lim ited biological significance. Interestingly, elevated EROD activity was observed in some women from both A rctic and southern Q uebec, and that response w as directly attributable to maternal cigarette sm oking. Sim ilar results have been seen in tw o subsequent studies involving new borns from Nunavik (Arctic Qu\u00e9bec), in w hich PCB body burden did not significantly influence placental CYP1A1 activity (Lagueux et al., 1999) (Pereg et al., 2002). In both studies, sm oking during pregnancy emerged as the major modulating factor for placental CYP1A1 activity . Thyroid horm one status in newborns A recent study exam ined the relationship between thyroid horm one status and exposure to pentachlorophenol and hy droxy lated PCB m etabolites in newborns, in tw o Canadian subsistence populations compared to southern Q uebec (Sandau et al., 2002). When individual chem ical residue data from umbilical cord plasm a were com pared to thy roid horm one markers, only pentachlorophenol w as negatively correlated to T3, free T4, and thy roxine-binding globulin concentrations. It is unknow n whether the observed decreases of these thyroid horm one m arkers are of functional biological significance, or if the decreas es were actually caused by pentachlorophenol. Governmental Agency Guidelines Daily Intake-Based Guidelines There are w ide variations in the consum ption guidelines developed for PCBs, dioxins and related chem icals among different governm ental organizations. These variations reflect the scientific uncertainties and ongoing controversy of PCB/dioxin toxicity at very low levels of exposure, and the different m ethods and assum ptions used during the risk assessm ent process. V arious governm ental agencies have established threshold exposure values, below which no adverse health effects would be expected to occur. These values are based on average daily intake levels, and have different nam es such as \"Minimal Risk Level\" (U.S. ATSDR), \"Reference Dose\" (U.S. \" Tolerable D aily Intake\" (European countries; Canada). The daily intake guidelines for PCBs, D ioxin Equivalents and PBD Es in several countries are presented in Tables 6a, 6b and 6c, respectively. Differences am ong daily intake guidelines are illustrated by comparing the risk levels established in the United States and Canada (Table 6a). The Canadian Tolerable Daily Intake of PCBs is 1 \u00b5g/kg-bw /d (K uhnlein, 1995). This value is fifty -fold higher (less conservative) than the U.S. EPA reference dose of 0.02 \u00b5g/kg-bw/d, but still incorporates a 5-fold safety factor above the lowest observed adverse effect level for PCBs from anim al studies (ocular effects and distorted nail grow th in monkey s). Som e of this difference reflects the conservative, risk-based approach of the U.S. EPA, versus the balanced risk/benefit approach of Health Canada. Differences in governm ental agency guidelines are generally less dram atic for dioxin equivalents. There is a ten-fold difference between the U.S. ATSDR Minim al Risk Level (1 pg/kg-bw /day) (US ATSDR, 2000) and the Health Canada Tolerable D aily Intake (10 pg/kg-bw /day) (Health Canada, 1996), w ith the levels established by Japan and European countries generally falling in between those two extrem es (European Com mission, 2001; Johansson and H anberg, 2000; Ministerial Council on D ioxin Policy , 1999; World Health Organization, 2001) (Table 6b). However, the U .S. EPA is w orking to reassess the risk of dioxins, and their calculations have produced a theoretical reference dose that is 100 to 1,000 times low er than current background exposure levels (which are currently approxim ately 0.5 - 1.0 pg/kg- bw/day) (USEPA , 2000a). The U .S. EPA has not yet set a reference dose for dioxin, but it appears that if they do, it may be orders of m agnitude m ore conservative than those established by other countries. In order to determ ine the non-carcinogenic risks associated w ith PCB exposure, the U .S. EPA considered a large body of literature related to chronic, develop- mental, immunological and neurobehavioral toxicity from human epidem iological and anim al studies. Risk calculations w ere perform ed using data from the strongest studies that show ed effects at the low est doses. The analy sis was ultim ately based on data from a study in w hich adult fem ale m onkey s were fed low doses of PCB (A roclor 1254) over a long period of tim e (ongoing; over 4 years). At the low est dose tested, 0.005 m g/kg- bw/day, subtle ocular effect s were observed such as eye exudate, inflam mation and/or prom inence of the eyelid. The monkey s also exhibited changes in finger and toe nails, and som e changes in im munological param eters were observed such as decreased IgG and IgM concentrations (IRIS, 1996). To calculate the daily reference dose that is likely to be without an appreciable risk of deleterious effects during a lifetim e, this lowest observable adverse effect level (LOAEL) of 0.005 mg/kg-bw /day was divided by a safety factor of 300. This sa fety factor included a factor 24 Risks in Perspective - PCBs of ten to protect the m ost sensitive members of the population, and three factors of 3 to account for uncertainties associated with (1) the extrapolation of data from monkey s to hum ans, (2) from subchronic toxicity to lifetim e chronic exposure, and (3) the fact that a LO AEL was used instead of a N OAEL (no observable adverse effect level). By this cons ervative approach, an oral reference dose (RfD) of 2 x 10-5 mg/kg-bw /day was derived. When a chem ical is associated w ith both carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic health effects, the U SEPA conducts two separate risk assessm ents based on the tw o types of endpoints (U SEPA , 1994). Both ty pes of risk assessm ents have been pe rform ed by the USEPA for PCBs. The U SEPA 's risk assessm ent of carcinogenicity was based on studies w ith rats treated w ith high doses of the com mercial PCB m ixture A roclor 1260 (25 to 100 ppm). For PCBs, the carcinogenic endpoint w as calculated to be m ore sensitive than chronic system ic endpoints such as reproductive, developm ental and immunological health. The reason w hy the carcinogenic endpoint turned out to be the m ost sensitive is that the USEPA uses a very conservative m ethod to calculate the risks posed by environm ental carcinogens. With their approach, it is assum ed that there is no threshold below which an increased cancer risk does not occur. Extrapolation of effects from high-dose laboratory studies to low environm ental levels is based on a linearized multistage no-threshold m odel. This approach has been widely criticized because it is unrealistically conservative and fails to take evidence of thresholds for carcinogenic endpoints into account, particularly for chem icals that act through a prom otion m echanism such as PCBs and dioxins (Ames et al., 1987; Covello and Merkhofer, 1993; Hanson, 1991; Shu et al., 1987). For the carcinogenic endpoint, the U SEPA has adopted a high risk and persistence upper-bound slope factor of 2.0 per (mg/kg)/day for PCBs (IRIS, 1996). The U SEPA concedes that this slope factor drives a currently recom mended seafood screening value for PCBs that \"will result in widespread exceedance in waterbodies throughout the country and will drive virtually all fish and shellfish contam inant m onitoring program s into the risk assessm ent phase for PCBs\" (U SEPA , 1995). In our opinion, a risk assessm ent for PCBs and dioxins based on chronic sy stem ic endpoints such as reproductive, developm ental and im munological health is more appropriate than a risk assessm ent based on a carcinogenic end point, because the chronic end point risk assessm ent has a stronger foundation of scientific evidence behind it. Anim al cancer studies were perform ed at high doses, at which the mechanism s of carcinogenicity may have involved cell proliferation as a result of cellular toxicity . This m echanism of toxicity would not be applicable to low -dose exposures. Furtherm ore, the linearized multistage no-threshold model used for extrapolation is inappropriate for use in PCB or dioxin risk assessm ent. The USEPA's focus on carcinogenicity as the m ost sensitive endpoint for PCBs and dioxins is not in accordance with hum an epidem iological evidence or laboratory anim al studies, which both suggest that developm ental and immunological deficits m ay occur at lower PCB or dioxin doses than does cancer (D eVito et al., 1995; Hanson, 1991). Therefore, for the rem ainder of this paper our risk assessm ent will focus on chronic sy stem ic health endpoints of PCB/dioxin exposure, using a very conservative approach with a large m argin of safety. Guidelines for Fish Advisories Individual states usually assum e prim ary responsibility for establishing fish consum ption advice for recreational and subsistence-caught fish w ithin their boundaries. The U.S. EPA has published fish consum ption guidelines based on contam inant concentrations, as a tool for states working to establish their criteria (U SEPA , 1994). Guidelines for fish consum ption vary widely from state to state, due to uncertainties of PCB- and dioxin- associated health effects, di fferences in risk assessm ent methods, and vary ing social, political and econom ic factors that contribute to risk m anagem ent decisions. For large bodies of water that border m ultiple states and countries, such as the G reat Lakes of N orth America, several different and conflicting fish advisories may be in force sim ultaneously (K amrin and Fischer, 1999). Guidelines for fish consum ption based on PCB concentrations can span several orders of m agnitude, as illustrated in Table 7. Fish advisories are inform ational rather than regulatory, such that com pliance with them is voluntary . The U .S. FD A has established regulations for the maximum allowable PCB concentrations in edible portions of food in com merce, called \" Tolerances\". In contrast w ith fish advisories , U.S. FDA To leran ces carry the force of law , and prohibit the sale of food items that exceed those concentrations. The m aximum allowable concentrations vary by food type, as show n in Table 8. The U.S. FDA has also established guidelines for dioxin content in fish; these guidelines are not form al tolerances that carry the force of law. The U.S. FDA guidelines state that no serious health effects are expected following consum ption of fish with less than 25 parts per trillion (ppt) 2,3,7,8-TCD D, while fish w ith 2,3,7,8-TCD D concentrations greater than 50 ppt should not be consum ed (A TSD R, 2003). Dietary Intake/Risk Assessment For the present purpose, risk assessm ent involves the consideration of toxicity , exposure scenarios and 25 Risks in Perspective - PCBs chem ical concentration data in order to evaluate the safety of subsistence food consum ption. When developing consum ption-oriented recom mendations for public health purposes, it is also critical to evaluate the beneficial aspects of traditional food consum ption. These include physical health benefits such as an apparent reduced risk of heart disease due to the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids found in fish and marine mammals, as well as the benefits of exercise associated with the harvest of traditi onal foods. There are also important social and cultural benefits associated with the harvest, sharing and consum ption of traditional foods (Usher et al., 1995). In addition, it is im portant to perform a relative risk assessm ent betw een traditional foods and the market foods that would replace them in the Alaskan Native diet. For exam ple, risks associated with trace contam inants in traditional foods should be com pared against the risks associated with a reduced nutrient intake or an increased intake of saturated fats associated with market food consum ption. Market foods also contain trace levels of contam inants, and their risks should be factored into any relative risk assessm ent. A nutritional study has demonstrated the superior nutritional quality of traditional foods in the A laskan N ative diet, and these foods were hypothesized to play a protective role against chronic diseases in the A laskan N ative population (Nobmann et al., 1992). Since concentrations of coplanar PCBs, dioxins and furans ar e poorly characterized in Alaskan subsistence foods, the follow ing risk assessm ent will focus on the sum med PCB congener data that is available. We perform ed a conservative risk assessm ent using US EPA methodology to calculate the \" maxim um allow able daily fish consum ption\", based on PCB concentrations in Alaska salm on from Table 3. These calculations are for discussion purposes only , and should not be interpreted as our actual advice since they do not take the benefits of traditional food consum ption into account. Also, the calculations are based on lim ited fish data, which are not sufficient to represent the state as a whole. To perform the calculations, the US EPA Reference Dose (RfD) was used in the follow ing equation: CR lim = [RfD BW] / C m where CR lim = maximum allow able daily consum ption rate of the fish species (kg/d) RfD = reference dose BW = consum er body weight (kg) Cm = m easured concentration of contam inant m (mg/kg) A body weight of 70 kg w as used in our calculations, which is the average weight of an adult m ale. Figure 5 illustrates the calculated daily consum ption limits that would result for the freshwater fish species from Schrader Lake, A laska, based on the analy sis of samples collected in 1992 (Wilson et al., 1995), and for chinook and chum salm on from the Y ukon-K uskokw im region (U SFWS , unpublished data). D ietary survey s have revealed that Native Alaskan adults consum e an average of 4 ounces of fish and shellfish daily , which is six times greater than the U.S. national average (Nobm ann et al., 1992). The concentrations of PCBs in Y -K salm on and in Schrader Lake fish are so low that they are very safe to eat, even at the high rates of consum ption ty pical for rural Alaskan com munities. The recent data available for Alaskan m arine m ammal tissue concentrations (Table 3) were also subjected to a risk assessm ent. In this analysis we focused on the consum ption of blubber, as this tissue contains the highest concentration of P CB-like com pounds. This is an overly conservative approach, because marine mammal blubber is often not eaten in isolation, but as \" maktak\", a combination of blubber and epiderm is w ith low er concentrations of lipophilic contam inants (Todd O'Hara, personal com munication). Since marine mammal tissue is consum ed by Alaskan Natives m uch less frequently than are fish or shellfish (Nobmann, 1989), a maximum monthly consum ption limit was calculated rather than a daily consum ption limit. The m onthly consum ption quantity of Alaskan marine mammal blubber deem ed safe by U.S. EPA standards was quite low. We compared the U.S. EPA risk assessm ent method with the PCB intake standard utilized in Canada (Figure 6). The Canadian Tolerable D aily Intake of PCBs is 1 \u00b5g/kg/d (K uhnlein, 1995). This value is fifty -fold higher (less conservative) than the USEPA reference dose of 0.02 \u00b5g/kg/d, but still incorporates a 5-fold safety factor above the lowest observed adverse effect level for PCBs from anim al studies (ocular effects and distorted nail grow th in monkey s). These results dem onstrate how dram atically the risk assessm ents perform ed by different governm ental agencies can vary , and how relevant these differences are to N ative A laskan subsistence food safety issues. Using the Canadian guidelines, w hich w e feel incorporate a reasonable cons ideration of both risks and benefits, it is apparent that m ost blubber from Alaskan marine mammals can be safely consum ed in large quantities. It is im portant to keep a relative perspective on the concentrations of PCBs found in Alaskan fish and m arine mammals. The concentration of PCBs found in A laskan beluga whale blubber w as sim ilar to the PCB 26 Risks in Perspective - PCBs concentration found in Steelhead trout from the Manistee River, Michigan in 1990, w hile concentrations of PCBs in blubber from other A laskan m arine m ammals w ere often similar to or below the concentrations found in fish from the Great Lakes (Table 9). PCB concentrations are far lower in blubber from baleen w hales, such as the gray whale and bow head w hale, than in blubber from toothed whales such as the beluga (Tables 3 and 4). In a survey of PCB concentrations in sedim ents and liver of bottom - feeding fish from bays of the U.S. West Coast, fish from Alaska and O regon w ere significantly less contam inated than fish from California and Washington (Varanasi et al., 1989). PCB concentrations in chinook and chum salm on from the Y ukon and K uskokw im were far low er than those observed in m ore industrialized parts of the world, and appear to reflect the rem ote, nearly industry - free environm ent of A laska (Figure 2). Blubber PCB concentrations of m ost marine m ammals in Alaska are far low er than the PCB concentrations found in blubber of long-finned pilot whales hunted near the Faroe Islands. Mean PCB concentrations (total PCBs quantified by Aroclor m atching) in the blubber of 53 Faroe Islands long-finned pilot w hales harvested in 1986 were 20 ppm (20,000 ng/g) w et weight (Sim monds et al., 1994). Mean D DE concentrations in the blubber (12 ppm wet weight) (Sim monds et al., 1994) and m ean methylmercury concentrations in various tissues (Julsham n et al., 1987) w ere also elevated in long-finned pilot whales from the Faroe Islands. Pilot whale tissue is commonly consum ed by the people of the Faroe Islands, and several m ajor health studies have been conducted there to look for possible contam inant-related health effects. In that population, prenatal m ethylmercury exposure w as m ore closely related to the slight neurobehavioral deficits reported than w as prenatal PCB exposure (G randjean et al., 2001). H owever, the researchers found that PCBs m ight possibly augm ent the neurobehavioral deficits seen at increased levels of methylmercury exposure. Sim ilarly , in a separate cohort from the Faroe Islands, increased methylm ercury exposures w ere associated w ith decreased neurologic optim ality scores in neonates, while PCB exposures had no effect (Steuerw ald et al., 2000). These studies are interesting, because they pr obably present a \"worst-case\" scenario for any possible hea lth risks associated with subsistence food consum ption in A laska. Interested readers are referred to this m onograph's Methy lmercury chapter for additional inform ation regarding the Faroe Islands studies. Another research group investigated the com parative risks and benefits of traditional native diets in Canada. Their approach focused on a docum entation of dietary intake, com plemented by detailed chem ical analysis of traditional food item s for their content of both nutrients and environm ental contam inants. A community in the Baffin Islands w as chosen as a sentinel population for study , due to a heavy reliance on marine species consum ption by the inhabitants. In an initial study of the com munity on Broughton Island (Kinloch and Kuhnlein, 1988), the average daily intake of PCBs (as sum med congeners) w as calculated to be 74 \u00b5g/day per individual. A lthough PCB concentrations were low in m ost food item s, marine mammal blubber and skin w as found to contain over 1 ppm PCBs. Consum ption of various food item s and dietary PCB intake w ere found to vary seasonally . No correlations were observed betw een calculated PCB intakes based on food consum ption and actual PCB blood concentrations in individuals. Sim ilar results w ere obtained in another recent study of the Canadian Inuit, in which traditional food intake during pregnancy was unrelated to PCB body burden (Muckle et al., 2001). PCB body burden is most closely associated with lifetim e consum ption patterns, so temporary dietary changes during pregnancy may not have m uch im pact on prenatal PCB exposure levels. Interestingly , in the 1985 study , three of four breast m ilk samples contained PCBs w ithin the sam e range reported for average southern Canadian w omen (13, 16 and 19 ppb PCBs in w hole m ilk, in com parison to the southern Canadian average of 15.9 ppb PCBs in w hole m ilk) (Kinloch and Kuhnlein, 1988). A breast m ilk sam ple from a fourth Inuit w oman contained 69 ppb PCBs in whole milk, which was above the Canadian 'tolerable level' of 50 ppb PCBs in whole m ilk. A larger follow up study (Kinloch et al., 1992) docum ented the substantial nutritive value of traditional foods in the Inuit community . Although m arine m ammal blubber sam ples w ere found to contain the greatest PCB concentrations am ong the traditional foods studied, blubber w as also docum ented to be an excellent and im portant source of retinol and omega-3 fatty acids for the Inuit diet. A balanced approach was urged tow ard the assessm ent of traditional food safety . Health risks m ight w ell be associated w ith a decreased reliance on traditional foods in native communities and a concom itant decline in nutritional status. Results from the above com munity on Broughton Island should not be extrapolated to represent the Canadian indigenous situation in general, or the situation in Alaska. The Broughton Island community was non- random ly selected from harvest data as a population w ith a relatively high risk of PCB contam ination, and w as intended to represent a w orst-case scenario am ong the Inuit (Kinloch and K uhnlein, 1988). O rganochlorine exposure in the Broughton Island Inuit has been compared with that of two Sahtu Dene/Metis communities from western Canada that relied heavily on traditional foods from a terrestrial food chain (K uhnlein 27 Risks in Perspective - PCBs et al., 1995; K uhnlein, 1995). Exposure to PCBs and other organochlorines w as found to be very low in the Sahtu Dene/Metis, and no traditional food item of the Sahtu D ene/Metis w as found to contain over 0.1 ppm PCBs. Traditional foods of the Sahtu Dene/Metis contained an abundant supply of many nutrients, and contributed m uch m ore protein, iron, zinc, m agnesium and copper to the diet than did m arket foods (K uhnlein, 1995). It should not be assum ed that dietary intake of PCBs is elevated in Native Alaskan com munities. Rather, research is needed to determ ine PCB exposure levels in Alaskan communities before risks can be assessed. Com munity -specific dietary intake levels, contam inant concentrations in traditional foods, and human bio- monitoring data w ould be very useful to determ ine the percent contribution of various foods to total hum an exposure levels. This inform ation w ould be useful to develop optim al consum ption advice. This approach has been very successful in Canada, where extended contam inants research w as conducted over the course of a decade under the Northern Contam inants Program (Van Oostdam et al., 1999). Concentrations of PCBs, Dioxins and Related Chemicals in Humans - Status and Trends PCB, Dioxin and Furan Con centrations in Alaskans Inform ation about POP concentrations in A laskans has increased substantially since our original m onograph was published in 1998. Tw o major investigations of serum organochlorine concentrations in A laskans have been completed, w hile a third is ongoing. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Cancer Institute, and the Indian Health Service collaborated with the Alaska Area Native Health Service to analy ze PCBs and pesticides in 131 banked serum samples from Alaska N ative w omen (Rubin et al., 2001). In 1999, the Alaska D ivision of Public H ealth and the CDC collaborated to provide serum PCB and organochlorine pesticide testing to 166 adult participants from five Aleutian and Pribilof Island Villages (Alaska Division of Public H ealth, 2001). Samples from the three Aleutian Island villages were also analy zed for dioxins, furans and coplanar PCBs. In a large ongoing study , the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium and the CDC are collaborating w ith a num ber of other agencies to monitor contam inant exposures in pregnant w omen from several Alaskan villages, as well as contam inant exposures and health outcom es in their new born babies. The CD C's N ational Center for Environm ental H ealth provided analytical laboratory services for all three projects, so analy tical methodology and data quality were both state-of-the-art and com parable. Serum PCB results for com parable sub-populations were similar am ong the three A laskan studies. For exam ple, the arithm etic m ean total PCB concentration in Alaska Native wom en (m ean age 57 years old) from the serum bank study was 7.56 ppb, w hile the m ean total PCB concentration in Aleutian/Pribilof volunteers (m ean age 49 y ears old) w as 7.69 ppb. In the Aleutian/Pribilof Islands exposure assessm ent, w omen of childbearing age had an average total PCB serum concentration of 2.9 ppb, while pregnant w omen in the A NTHC study had an average total PCB serum concentration of 1.29 ppb in Bethel and 0.77 ppb in Barrow (Dr. Jim Berner 2002, personal com munication). Serum PCB concentrations in Aleutian/Pribilof wom en of childbearing age were also similar to m aternal plasm a PCB concentrations from other arctic countries (A MAP, 1998) (Figure 7). Age- and sex-related differences w ere observed in PCB concentrations am ong A leutian/Pribilof Island partici- pants. PCB concentrations w ere strongly associated w ith age, with higher PCB concentrations observed am ong older participants. In m ost age groups, PCB concentrations were higher in m ale participants than in female participants (Figure 8). Serum PCB concen- trations were low in wom en of childbearing age relative to the older persons sam pled (Figure 9). Since the developing fetus is the m ost sensitive m ember of the human population to the adverse health effects of PCBs, it is m ost im portant to m inimize PCB exposures in women who are or m ay becom e pregnant. The CDC has recently published national reference range data for individual PCB, dioxin and furan congeners (CDC, 2003). In 1999-2000, the serum of over 1200 random ly-selected American adults w as collected and analyzed . These NHANES resu lts are ch allen ging to compare with m any studies, because they are only presented as selected percentiles for individual congeners on a lipid-adjusted basis. Many PCB, dioxin and furan congeners were not detected in the national NHANES sample, so no num bers are available for them with which to perform com parative calculations. We were able to compare th e NHANES d ata to our Aleu tian/Pribilof data for eight non-planar PCB congeners (Table 10). Results varied among congeners, but PCB concentrations w ere consistently higher in the Aleutian/Pribilof data relative to the national reference data. This was to be expected, because Alaska Natives consum e far more fish than the national average (N obmann et al., 1992). We were also able to compare the NHANES d ata to our Aleutian/Pribilof data for tw o dioxin congeners, one furan congener, and tw o coplanar PCB congeners (Table 11). Results varied am ong congeners, but in general the national data and Aleutian/Pribilof data were similar for these dioxin-like chem icals. In general, PCB concentrations in Aleutian/Pribilof volunteers were similar to those of G reat Lakes fish consum ers, w hile 28 Risks in Perspective - PCBs average dioxin, furan and coplanar PCB concentrations in A leutian/Pribilof volunteers w ere about half those found in Great Lakes fish consum ers (A nderson et al., 1998; H umphrey et al., 2000) (Table 12). PCB, Dioxin and Furan Con centrations in Canadians Inuit communities from Arctic Quebec have a heavy reliance on marine species consum ption, and their exposure to POPs has been investigated. In one study , breast m ilk fat from the Inuit wom en of east Hudson Bay contained an average of 1 ppm PCBs (as summed congeners), w hich w as sim ilar to the PCB concentration found in beluga blubber from the region (Dewailly et al., 1993). A verage concentrations of PCBs in breast m ilk fat of Inuit w omen w ere 6.7 tim es higher than PCB concentrations found in breas t milk fat of 96 Caucasian women from southern Q uebec, when expressed as summed PCB congeners (Dewailly et al., 1993). Com parisons betw een A rctic and southern Quebec have also been m ade for dioxin, furan and coplanar PCB concentrations in breast milk. The data w ere expressed as TCD D-equivalents for the dioxins, furans and non- ortho m easur ed (Dewailly et al., 1992; Dewailly et al., 1994b). The Toxic Equivalency Factors used to calculate TCD D-equivalents (TEQ s) have been updated since those papers w ere published. When the most current TEFs from the World H ealth O rganization are used (Van den Berg et al., 1998), the average TEQ s in Inuit and Caucasian breast m ilk fat were 52 and 26 ppt, respectively : a 2-fold difference (Dewailly et al., 1992). Although PCB exposure w as greater in Inuit w omen relative to Caucasian w omen, differences in exposure to polychlorinated dioxins and furans w ere slight betw een the tw o populations. The results demonstrate how data interpretations and study conclusions can vary based upon the ty pe of PO P analy sis chosen. The results of the above study were interpreted by the investigators to evidence a \" surprisingly high organo- chlorine body burden\" (Dewailly et al., 1993) in Inuit wom en, as a result of receipt of \" an unusually high dose of dioxin-like com pounds through their traditional diet\" (Ayotte et al., 1996). In fact, the degree of elevation of PCB- and dioxin-like concentrations in the Inuit w as overstated. The average concentrations of PCBs reported in milk fat of these Inuit w omen (1 ppm expressed as summed congeners) w ere not elevated above the background concentrations found in hum an m ilk fat in industrial countries throughout the world, which averaged 0.5 to 1.5 ppm PCBs (Jensen, 1991). When expressed as total TEQs using the m ost recent TEFs (Van den Berg et al., 1998), the concentrations of dioxin-like chem icals were sim ilar in Canadian Inuit breast milk fat and in background breast m ilk fat from women in the Netherlands (52 ppt and 54 ppt respectively , Figure 10) (Dewailly et al., 1992; Koopm an-Esseboom et al., 1994a). Time Trends for POP Concentrations in Humans PCB concentrations in hum ans around the w orld are declining. D eclining PCB concentrations have been observed at lower latitudes for over a decade (Schade and H einzow , 1998; Tee et al., 2003), and are now being docum ented in the Arctic as well. Total PCB concentrations have dropped precipitously in hum an breast m ilk in Sw eden during the past 30 y ears (N oren and Meirony te, 2000) (Figure 11). Steady declines in concentrations of PCBs a nd organochlorine pesticides have been observed in hum an infants from an eastern arctic Canadian com munity from 1993 to 2000 (D allaire et al., 2002) (Figure 12). The reason for the organochlorine decline in um bilical cord blood w as not determ ined, but a decline in m aternal fish consum ption was unlikely, as om ega-3 fatty acid concentrations in cord blood declined only slightly over time. Declining organochlorine concentrations in um bilical cord blood were hypothesized to be due to low er PCB concentrations in traditional food species, or perhaps by modified consum ption of seabird eggs (the com munity 's principle source of organochl orine exposure). Continued human biom onitoring in A laska is needed to assess our long-term exposure trends. In contrast to PCBs, w hich are declining in hum ans, polybrominated dipheny l ether (PBD E) concentrations are increasing exponentially in som e sampled populations. For exam ple, total PBD Es increased exponentially in Swedish breastm ilk during the period 1972 to 1997 (Meirony te et al., 1999; N oren and Meirony te, 2000) (Figure 13) . PBD Es also increased exponentially in human serum from Norway during the period from 1977 to 1999 (Thom sen et al., 2002). Two recent studies showed that serum concentrations of the predom inant PBD E congener, PBD E-47, w ere m uch higher in Indiana (Mazdai et al., 2003) and in California (Petreas et al., 2003) than in Sw eden (G uvenius et al., 2003) (Figure 14). A nother prelim inary assessm ent of PBDEs in the breast m ilk of North American wom en indicated that the body burden of PBD Es in Americans and Canadians m ay be the highest in the world, and breast m ilk concentrations in North Am erica appear to be increasing at an exponential rate. Average North American breast m ilk concentrations in 2000 were 40 times greater than the highest concentrations reported for women in Sweden (Betts, 2002). A lso, the relative ratio of PBD Es to PCBs in hum ans appears to be different in Sweden than in Am erica. Considering the concentration of the predom inant PBD E congener (PBD E-47) relative 29 Risks - PCBs to the predom inant PCB congener (PCB-153), recent studies have show n a 67-fold PCB 153/PBD E 47 ratio in Sweden (G uvenius et al., 2003), but only a 4-fold PCB 153/PBD E 47 ratio in California (Petreas et al., 2003). These results indicate that PBDE contam ination in North America m ay be a large, em erging problem that m ay soon overtake PCB contam ination as a public health concern. This is particular ly true because PCBs have been banned in the U .S. since 1976, but no restrictions are yet in place on PBDE production or use in North America. In a Norway tim e trend study, PBDE concentrations were not related to gender or age in a m anner sim ilar to PCBs (Thom sen et al., 2002). The current body burden of brom inated flam e retardants (including PBD Es) in Norway appeared to be independent of age, except for in infants (0-4 y ears old), w ho had 1.6-3.5 tim es higher concentrations than other age groups. At present, we have no data on PBD E concentrations in Alaskans. It is a top environm ental public health priority to assess PBD E exposure levels and trends in A laskans. Public Health Evaluation for Alaska Alaskans have been exposed to PO Ps at levels similar to those found in other arctic countries, and in fish-eating populations from the Low er 48. Several comprehensive efforts have been undertaken to evaluate the health risks of contam inants in traditional foods in the arctic, balancing risks against the nutritional, social, spiritual and econom ic benefits of tr aditional foods. The Arctic Monitoring and A ssessm ent Program me (AMAP, 2003) and Canada's N orthern Contam inants Program (Arnold et al., 2003) are large, long-term projects involving many scientific experts w ho have been working for many years to investigate arctic contam inants and their hum an health implications. In general, these projects have concluded that w hile some small risks m ay exist related to possible adverse health effects from POP exposures, these risks are vastly outw eighed by the m any benefits of traditional food consum ption. Traditional f oods provide inexpensive and readily available nutrients, essential fatty acids, antioxidants, calories and protein, and m any health benefits such as protection from diabetes, cardiovascular disease, improved maternal nutrition and neonatal and infant brain developm ent. Market replacem ent foods are often nutritionally inferior, are high in saturated fat, sugar and salt, and also contain contam inants. Unhealthful market replacem ent foods present their own health risks, and may contribute to the rising rates of diabetes, heart disease, and other health problem s in villages that reduce their traditional food consum ption. The traditional lifesty le and diet are also of great importance to the self-definition, self-determ ination, cultural and socio-econom ic, and overall health and well- being of indigenous peoples. Recom mendations to restrict traditional food consum ption have caused cultural disruptions and have unintended adverse consequences in Native com munities. Fortunately , the POP levels docum ented in Alaska to date are not expected to cause adverse health effects. We continue to recom mend the unrestricted consum ption of traditional foods. Despite a lack of any clear evidence of adverse health effects at low POP exposure levels, some individuals may choose to limit their exposure to PO Ps. Individuals may lessen their exposure to POPs while still enjoy ing a traditional diet by choosing sm aller, younger anim als that are low er in the food chain. Exposure can be further reduced by choosing lean tissues rather than fatty tissues from ma rine mamma ls. A long-term hum an biom onitoring program in A laska is critical to assess trends in contam inant exposure and nutrient intake, and to continually verify that our consum ption advice is optim ally protective of hum an health. The Section of Epidem iology and the A laska Public H ealth Laboratory within the Alaska Division of Public Health are currently collaborating to establish such a biom onitoring program . The Alaska Public Health Laboratory is developing the capacity to m easure persistent organic pollutants, including PCBs, dioxins, furans, and PBDEs, in hum an serum . This analytical support will enable the Section of Epidem iology 's Environm ental Public H ealth Program to offer blood testing to Alaskans who are concerned about potential POP exposures. This will be a valuable extension to the Division's biom onitoring efforts, w hich include the statewide Maternal Hair Mercury Biom onitoring Program (Alaska D ivision of Public H ealth, 2002). The Maternal Hair Mercury program was review ed by the Alaska Area Institutional Review Board and was determ ined to be standard public health practice, not research. Conclusions and Future Directions Traditional foods are an important and healthful component of the diet of N ative A laskans. The Division of Public H ealth strongly endorses the consum ption of subsistence foods. PCB concen trations in A laskan fish are far lower than in m ost fish from the Lower 48, reflecting the relatively rem ote, nearly industry-free environm ent of m any regions of Alaska. Wild Alaska salm on are a particularly nutritious food, and have undetectable to negligible contam inant concentrations. 30 Risks in Perspective - PCBs The benefits of a traditional food diet far outw eigh the potential relative risks posed by trace quantities of POPs in traditional foods. We encourage the consum ption of a varied diet consisting of a num ber of different species and tissues. Exposure to PO Ps can be lessened by choosing anim als from a low er trophic level (for exam ple, baleen whales rather than toothed whales) and by avoidance of older m ale anim als. A dditional inform a- tion should be obtained regarding the PO P content of the beluga whale, ringed seal, bearded seal, Pacific walrus, northern fur seal and Stellar sea lion, to better assess human exposure. Alaskans w ho have traditionally consum ed marine mammals in their diet should continue to enjoy their foods. Marine m ammal blubber-containing foods are excellent sources of m onounsaturated fatty acids, omega- 3 fatty acids, and fat- soluble vitam ins. Risks associated with avoidance of m arine m ammal consum ption are greater than the sm all potential risk of subtle health effects from POPs in blubber. For exam ple, avoidance of marine m ammal blubber and replacem ent with foods high in saturated fat (such as Crisco, fat products from cattle and pigs, and dairy products such as butter and cheese) would increase the prevalence of heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers in Alaska Natives. Key know ledge gaps m ust be the focus of future studies of subsistence food safety . There is a pressing need to obtain additional inform ation regarding PCB concentra- tions in A laskan subsisten ce foods and sport fish. The State of A laska needs to conduct comprehensive evaluations of subsisten ce foods. While progress has been m ade on fish sam pling and analy sis in Alaska, comparable surveys are needed for m arine m ammal tissues. To protect public health, w e need inform ation about concentrations of POPs in subsistence species, including data on the age, sex and tissue type of the anim als. It is also necessary to m easure how various preparation methods influence PCB concentrations in subsistence foods as they are actually consum ed by people. Village- specific dietary surveys are also needed to determ ine the identity and quantity of the foods people are eating. We need to refine our chem ical analyses and obtain congener-specific inform ation, including data on coplanar congeners, dioxins, furans, and PBD Es. Of m ost im portance, Alaska m ust measure human PCB exposure. Inform ation regarding PCB concentrations in Alaskans is lim ited. We have no inform ation about PCB concentrations in the adipos e tissue or breast m ilk of Alaskans. A top priority is to analy ze PBDEs in the serum of A laskans and to monitor PBD E exposure trends over time. We know that PBD E concentrations are increasing rapidly in North Am erican wildlife. Hum an exposure inform ation will provide public health officials with the m ost relevant data possible regarding PO P exposure through the subsis tence food chain. A long- term human biom onitoring program is needed to comprehensively evaluate contam inant exposures and their public health im plications in Alaska. 31 Risks in Perspective - PCBs Table 1.
