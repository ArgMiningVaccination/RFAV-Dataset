However, limited data are available on influenza vaccine utilization by US pediatric providers. Objectives: To describe US pediatric influenza vaccination during the previous 4 seasons. Methods: Electronic healthcare reimbursement claims data representing more than 60% of all medical claims from the US outpatient setting were analyzed. Weekly counts of influenza vaccinations given to children 6 months through 18 years of age between August 1 and March 31 for the 2006-2007 through 2009-2010 seasons were projected to yield national estimates for all children with private insurance. Results: From 2006-2007 through 2008-2009, vaccination began approximately 1 week earlier each season. In 2009-2010, seasonal vaccination began 4 weeks earlier. Seasonal vaccination peaked in November in 2006-2007 and 2007-2008, October in 2008-2009, and September in 2009-2010. In all seasons, vaccination dramatically declined in December. Total seasonal vaccinations increased from 7.2 million in 2006-2007 to 9.9 million in 2009-2010 (+38%). Among children 6-23 months of age, use of preservative-free injectable vaccine increased each year, to 58% of 2009-2010 vaccinations. Among children 2-18 years of age, use of the intranasal vaccine increased each year, to 34% of 2009-2010 vaccinations. In 2009, H1N1 vaccination began in early October, peaked in mid December 2009, and continued at lower levels through spring 2010. Conclusions: Consistent with national recommendations, pediatric influenza vaccination has increased significantly in recent years. From 2006-2007 to 2009-2010, pediatric influenza vaccination began and peaked 1-4 weeks earlier each season. However, despite efforts to extend the vaccination season into later months, there was no evidence of increased late-season vaccination. Additional research is needed to identify barriers to late-season vaccination. "}
