We offer the following undergraduate, graduate, and professional degrees: - Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Pharmaceutical Sciences - Master of Science in Pharmacology (MSP) - Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Pharmacological Sciences - Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) Our school encompasses two departments: Pharmaceutical Sciences (established in 2007) and Clinical Pharmacy Practice (established in 2020). As part of the [Susan and Henry Samueli College of Health Sciences](https://healthaffairs.uci.edu/the-college/), we actively collaborate with schools and programs in medicine, nursing, population and public health, and the Susan Samueli Integrative Health Institute to educate, train, and mentor the next generation of pharmaceutical scientists and clinical pharmacists. Together, we will make positive impacts for individuals, communities, and our healthcare system. With our range of academic programs, clinical practice and research, the UCI School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences spans a continuum from discovery, development, and delivery of new drugs, devices, and diagnostics all the way to optimizing medication therapy in patients and patient populations. Enrolling in our B.S. in Pharmaceutical Sciences program is an opportunity to join one of the top pharmaceutical sciences departments in the nation while starting on your career path into this exciting field. Our MSP is a two-year, online degree program designed for working professionals looking to advance in their careers.
