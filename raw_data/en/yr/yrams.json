Max Supervisory ReportOREGON DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES WAYS AND MEANS REFERENCE DOCUMENT 2023-25 \"Assisting People to Become Independent, Healthy and Safe\" Department of Human Services Office of the Director 500 Summer St. NE, E-15 Salem, OR 97301 Voice: 503-945-5600 Governor Director Fariborz Pakseresht , Oregon Department of Human Services Governor Tina 2023-25 Governor's Recommended Budget (GRB) is titled \"Mission Focused\" because it zeroes in on her top three priorities - housing and homelessness, improving access to mental health and addiction services, and improving educational outcomes across grades pre-K-12. It also reflects the Governor's commitment to putting customer service at the forefront of state agencies' work. From technology investments to added staffing, it would provide key resources to empower our state workforce to deliver for people in communities throughout Oregon. I'm pleased to report that the GRB, which includes a proposed budget of $17.8 billion in total funds and 11,111 positions for ODHS, contains a range of investments that will support our ongoing efforts in all three of our agency-wide focus areas - strengthening our foundations to ensure we can serve our communities equitably and effectively, preparing for and responding to emergencies, and creating the future of human services. Highlights of investments (in General Fund dollars) include: Strengthening foundations The GRB allocates critical funds to support the well-being of older adults and people with disabilities, including $405 million toward rates for providers around the state who deliver essential services to people with the highest needs. Another $38.2 million would ensure that individuals of any immigration status can access Medicaid health care and long-term services and supports through the Healthier Oregon Program. The GRB also includes $46 million to support the ONE eligibility system , which helps one in three people in Oregon apply for and manage medical, food, cash and child care benefits. The budget supports both maintenance and improvements for this key software along with funding to maintain staff who help connect people with benefits. An additional $3 million would go toward modernizing the mainframe and provider payment systems. Two other investments would strengthen our ability to serve families involved in the Child Welfare system, including $1 million to assist Child Welfare caseworkers in matching parents with providers in cases where \"Assisting People to Become Independent, Healthy and Safe\" alcohol and drug treatment services are needed, and $4 million to expand legal representation services delivered through the Oregon Department of Justice for Child Welfare cases. Preparing for and responding to emergencies The GRB proposes an initial investment of $2 million in the Office of Resilience and Emergency Management (OREM), an ODHS office created after the historic 2020 wildfires to better serve communities impacted by disaster and help the state prepare for future emergencies. Over the past two years, OREM has delivered more than 2 million meals to wildfire survivors; sheltered 4,400 people in the wake of wildfires; sourced and delivered water to people impacted by drought; ensured that Oregonians who rely on electric-powered, life-sustaining equipment were able to survive public-safety power shutoffs; and helped local jurisdictions evacuate people to safety during the wildfires. Creating the future of human services Several investments strengthen the ways we support Oregon families, maximizing their capacity to care for their children and nurture children's healthy development at home, including a $7 million allocation that would allow us to hire more Child Protective Services workers, expanding our capacity to assess and address family needs so more children can remain safely with their families instead of entering foster care. Additional investments include $7 million to expand the FOCUS Program \u2014 a program that allows children with complex needs to remain in their own communities in a culturally appropriate foster care home, relative care or parent's home - while a $17 million investment would raise the monthly pay for resource parents to provide foster care. Increasing these rates both attracts and retains more, and more diverse, families to provide this care. An additional $1.4 million would fund the Model Employer Program , which allows ODHS to hire people with intellectual and developmental disabilities more quickly and easily, creating more opportunities for young people and adults with disabilities to contribute to the state workforce. Another $4 million would fund staffing capacity and systems costs to implement the Oregon Health Authority's 1115 Medicaid Waiver. \"Assisting People to Become Independent, Healthy and Safe\" The resources identified in this budget would allow ODHS to make significant strides in supporting the well-being of individuals, families and communities in Oregon. Of course, this work cannot happen without the tens of thousands of staff - both in ODHS and in our partner organizations - who provide people in Oregon with the services and supports they need to thrive. I continue to be amazed by the compassion, commitment and skill these staff members bring to their work, navigating the many challenges and delivering for our communities every day. I am deeply grateful for all they do.

Oregon Department of Human Services Central Services 2023-25 Ways and Means Page |1 Oregon Department of Human Services Central Services Budget Narrative Overview ODHS Central Services provide essential supports to ODHS programs, helping each achieve their vision, realize target outcomes, and advance the wider agency mission. It consist s of the Office of the Director and Policy including the Chief of Staff, Tribal Affairs, the Deputy Director, the Office of the Chief Financial Officer , the Office of Immigrant and Refugee Advancement, and the Governor's Advocacy Office . Central office also includes the Office of Equity and Multicul tural Services (OEMS), the Office of Resilience and Emergency Management (OREM), the Office of Human Resources, the Central ODHS Budget, Planning and Analysis Office, the Public Affairs office which includes Government Relations , Public Records, Legal Unit and Communications, the Office of Program Integrity, and the Office of Reporting Research, Analytics and Implementation. T he Office of Business Information Services, the Office of Information Support Services and the Integrated Eligibility and Medicaid Eligibility ONE Pro gram Office are all being moved budgetarily into a separate Oregon Eligibility Partnership structure as part of the Governor's Budget (GB) . These offices provide essential business supports to programs in achieving the department and programs mission, vision, and outcomes. The ODHS Central budgets are structured and administered according to the following principles: Control over major costs. ODHS centrally manages many major costs. ODHS also strongly supports and actively partic ipates in statewide efforts to locate work across the enterprise and install performance management systems to perform administrative functions more efficiently and effectively. ODHS continues with the Fundamentals map process, including Quarterly Performa nce Reviews . ODHS has an expectation of managers and all staff to bring forward ideas for process improvement. ODHS is also in the initial stages of the Wellbeing project, including a dedicated focus of becoming a non-racist Agency and looking at new inventive ways to look at how human services are delivered in 2022 and beyond. Being more customer - centric and doing outreach to local communities, with a n intentional focus on engaging marginalized and underserved communities. Oregon Department of Human Services Central Services 2023-25 Ways and Means Page |2 Oregon Department of Human Services Central Services Budget Narrative The ODHS Governor's Budget ( GB) provides funding for Central Services at $54.2 million General Fund and $113.7 million Total funds: Major changes from 21-23 LAB to 23- 25 GB include: Standard inflation Phase out of one -time funding for wildfires Statewide rate adjustments Reductions to meet the statewide General Fund budget Investment into Policy Option Packages Strategic Funding Investments and Adjustments POP 106 - Chief Data Office \"Accurate and reliable data can improve quality of life for the people we serve. Accurate and easily available data can direct services to where they are needed. Accurate data can offer solutions to problems. Data even has the ability to address inequities and disproportionalities, given the resources necessary to identify, gather and maintain them. Data inconsistency negatively and disproportionately impact people and communities of color, Tribal members and communities, people with disabilities and members of the LGBTQIA2S+ community. On the ground level, data give ou r case workers access to accurate information so they can spend more time in direct service to people. Currently one limited duration employee is the data expert for the Oregon Department of Human Services - a complex agency serving one in three Oregonians. This policy package creates a data office of three positions and budget for contract services. The data office will: 1. Set and lead vision and standards for data collection, use, management, governance, ethics, and justice. 2. Manage compliance with O pen Data mandates (ORS 276A.350 -276A.371). 3. Lead the development of tools and culture to enable ODHS to better use data to plan, make decisions and deliver service. 4. Implement data quality, management, and integration practices to create the future of human services, reduce disproportionality and inequity, respond better to emergencies and disasters, and adopt REALD/SOGIE (Race, Ethnicity, Language and Disability/Sexual Oregon Department of Human Services Central Services 2023-25 Ways and Means Page |3 Oregon Department of Human Services Central Services Budget Narrative Orientation, Gender Identity and Gender Expression) standards. If this POP is not funded, adverse effects include: first and foremost, slow service delivery, missed opportunities to focus services where they are needed most and the perpetuation of health inequities. If not funded, it will also adversely affect compliance with Open Data mandates; diminish the ability to identify and correct disproportionalities and inequities; and miss opportunities to streamline technology implementations due to continued siloed organization of data and related decision making. Lack of comprehensive data affects our ability to equitably serves Oregonians. \" POP 109 - Ofc of Resiliency and Emergency Management Staffing The Office of Resilienc y and Emergency Management (OREM) provides disaster services to all Oregonians. OREM was created in response to the 2020 wildfires, but its charge involves preparing for and responding to all types of emergencies, including the Cascadia Subduction Zone Earthquake, refugee crises, extreme weather events, and drought. OREM helps people be safe, resilient, and eventually self-sustaining. In the last two years OREM has responded to help people affected by excessive heat events, an ice storm, lack of safe drinking water, and a chemical leak. OREM has sheltered more than 4,400 wildfire survivors in over 60 hotels from Portland to Ashland; delivered more than 2 million hot meals, three times a day, seven days a week to wildfire survivors, sourced and delivered 500- gallon tanks to 200 people whose wells ran dry due to the recent drought in Klamath County; the list goes on. Whil e Oregon Department of Human Services is identified in state statute as the primary agency for providing Mass Care during disasters, OREM has been operating without legislatively approved funding since the wildfires of September 2020. In order to fulfill our statutory responsibilities and help Oregonians successfully prepare for and recover from disasters, OREM is requesting additional funding. The funds will allow us to continue program operations while expanding our efforts to partner with communities, Tr ibes, and community- based organizations to improve local disaster preparedness across the state. The policy package requests funding the existing staff to maintain as well as grow this essential program. Below is an overview of the offices within the Central Budget.

Oregon Department of Human Services Shared Services and Statewide and Enterprise -wide Costs 2023-25 Ways and Means Page |1 Oregon Department of Human Services Shared Services /SAEC Budget Narrative Overview Customer -driven shared services. When the agency split, ODHS and OHA agreed to maintain many infrastructure functions as shared services to prevent cost increases, maintain centers of excellence, and preserve standards that help the agencies work together. ODHS Shared Services supports both ODHS and OHA by provid ing critical business services that are data -informed, accountable, and transparent. ODHS and Oregon Health Authority (OHA) govern their shared services through a boa rd composed of operational leaders from the two agencies who ensure that shared services are prioritized and managed to support program needs. The board and its subgroups have established service level agreements and performance measures for each service, implemented recent budget cuts, moved staff in and out of shared services to rationalize service delivery, and begun implementing more integrated systems to support the performance of all our employees. Shared Services are completely Other Funded and provi de services to both ODHS and OHA. Funding for Shared Services is included in the Shared Services Funding portion of the Statewide and Enterprise -wide Costs (SAEC) budget in each agency . ODHS Shared Services The Governor's Budget ( GB) for shared services is $180.1 million Other Funds with 729 positions and 723.75 FTE. The GB for SAEC is $ 389.0 million General Fund and $ 730.5 million Total Fund. Major changes between 2021- 23 LAB and 2023- 25 GB include: Phase in of investments made in 2021 -23 Standard Inflation Statewide rate adjustments Reductions to meet the statewide General Fund budget Investment into Policy Option Packages Oregon Department of Human Services Shared Services and Statewide and Enterprise -wide Costs 2023-25 Ways and Means Page |2 Oregon Department of Human Services Shared Services /SAEC Budget Narrative Strategic Funding Investments and Adjustments Proposed investments in Shared services include: Shared Services POPs: SAEC POPs: 203 - Mainframe Migration/Provider & Client Payment System Everyone in Oregon deserves uninterrupted access to needed supports and to the income they earn at work. More than one million Oregonians count on the state's current mainframe platform to receive their benefit and provider payments. The COBOL programming code on the mainframe system dates to the 1970s and is increasingly unsupported. Mainframe -proficient staff are shrinking in number and hard to replace, resulting in a variety of service and payment bottlenecks. If these problems are not resolved, there is increasing risk that the agency will be unable to make timely payments to Oregonians, potentially for an extended period. Oregon Department of Human Services and the Oregon Health Authority are therefore jointly requesting the resources necessary to upgrade our mainframe platform and ensure continuity of payments and benefits for the people we serve. It is critical that we migrate all current mainframe functions to more modern, ideally cloud-based solutions. Doing so will help avoid the risk of service breakdowns caused by old software, bring ODHS and OHA technology into alignment with peer agencies, improve flow across interfacing information systems, a nd allow Oregon to achieve full benefit from its investments in the ONE eligibility system. This investment proposes a strategy to plan for and implement a new payment system, move all remaining benefits currently determined on the mainframe to the ONE system, and develop a plan to decommission or archive remaining mainframe programs and data.

The office converts more than three million pieces of paper - applications, bills, claims, checks, and more - each month, making information more readily available and saving money on storage costs. The Office of Contracts and Procurement provides contract and procurement services for ODHS and OHA by procuring supplies and services in the most cost- effectiv e manner through innovative and responsible solutions. The unit provides guidance, training, and support to meet contracting and procurement needs and assists agencies with supplier diversity programs that seek to include women - and minority- owned and emer ging small businesses. The Office of Investigations, Training and Safety e nsures safety and protection to the more than 77,500 people per biennium who receive mental health, developmental disability, or children's therapeutic services in Oregon. The o ffice consists of four primary functional units: Investigations, Children's Care Lice nsing, Contested Case - Administrative Law Judge Hearings, and Training and Transformation (TnT - which includes: Quality Management and Prevention, Oregon Department of Human Services Shared Services and Statewide and Enterprise -wide Costs 2023-25 Ways and Means Page |6 Oregon Department of Human Services Shared Services /SAEC Budget Narrative Policy and Legal, Data, and Investigator training). Together, these functional units provide services to several programs of ODHS and OHA that serve some of Oregon's most vulnerable citizens. The Internal Audit and Consulting provides independent and objective information and consulting services for ODHS and OHA. The internal audit team reviews all areas of ODH S/OHA, including central operations and programs, field offices, and institutions. The unit provides other services such as consultation on internal controls and process improvement efforts, facilitation of risk assessment activities, coordination of exter nal audits and tracking and follow -up on both internal and external audit findings. The Office of Payment, Accuracy and Recovery i dentif ies, establishes the extent of, and recover s monies owed to O DHS or OHA by clients, providers, and third-party payers for services provided by our state and federally funded health and human services programs. The office carries out these responsibilities in a customer sensitive manner and returns owed monies timely to agency programs . Its staff work in collaboration with a gency programs to continuously improve the accuracy of provider and client payments and program integrity and to serve as a deterrent presence through working relationships with law enforcement and client and provider organizations, and by publicly communi cating the outcomes of OPAR's fraud investigation and collection-related unit activities. Publications and C reative Services manages the writing, design, development, printing, and distribution of ODHS and OHA publications for internal and external audiences, including those in accessible formats and multiple languages. This unit plays a central role in document translation services for both agencies. PCS provides consulting to plan professional quality print and digital publications that reflect ODHS and OHA style guidelines; edits and proofs materials created by staff experts and partners in their individual fields; and provides graphic design, layout, illustration, and form creation services. Oregon Department of Human Services Shared Services and Statewide and Enterprise -wide Costs 2023-25 Ways and Means Page |7 Oregon Department of Human Services Shared Services /SAEC Budget Narrative Overview of Statewide and Enterprise -wide Cos ts (SAEC) ODHS has statewide assessments that include Department of Administrative Services ( DAS ) charges such as the State Government Service Charge, Risk Assessment, and enterprise technology services Charges. Rent for all of ODHS is in the Facilities budget. This budget includes the computer replacement budget. The Shared Services funding is the revenue for the ODHS portion of ODHS and OHA shared services. When the agency split, ODHS and OHA agreed to share information technology, financial, investigations, and other services to avoid cost increases and permit a greater focus on improving performance and efficiency. Debt services is to pay off Certificates of Participation or Q-Bond loans taken for major ODHS projects. Each service, both shared and assessed, are important for ODHS to attain its programmatic outcomes. It is critical to continue to look for efficiencies in our systems, processes, and staffing. This budget also includes the costs of telecommunications, unemployment insurance, mass transit, administrative hearings, and limitation for a line of credit from the Treasury Department used for cash flow purposes at the end of the biennium. 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page |1 Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare Programs Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare Budget Narrative Overview The Child Welfare Vision for Transformation is based on a belief that children do best growing up in a family and on values related to honoring and supporting cultural wisdom, building community resilience and voice, and ensuring the self - determination of our communities of color and those who have historically experienced the worst outcomes . The Child Welfare Division serves children and families who are facing challenges that can affect child safety and responds when children are subject to abuse and neglect. Skilled and diverse C hild Welfare staff respond to reports of child abuse and neglect, help ing to assess whether supports or services can be provided to the family to prevent the need for out- of-home care and coord inating foster care placement in cases where a child cannot be maintained safely at home. The primary goal is to keep children safe while providing equitable services to support timely and safe return to their families in cases where an out of home placeme nt is necessary . The Child Welfare Division's work encompasses the following areas : 1. Child Abuse Hotline 2. Child Safety Program 3. Child Fatality Review and Prevention Program 4. Family Preservation 5. Child and F amily Well -Being Programs 6. Permanency Program 7. Program Design & Delivery 8. Federal Policy, Planning & Resources , and Child Welfare Policy Other Central Office Programs and Focus Areas Child Welfare is working to improve equity and inclusion in all aspects of our program and to provide inclusive, equitable and culturally responsive and appropriate services to children, young adults, and families. Additionally, C hild Welfare is working with communities, Tribal Nations, and other child welfare partners to: Centering equity in all aspects of the work Creat ing more transparent and meaningful partnerships Sharing quality data and outcomes 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page |2 Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare Programs Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare Budget Narrative Includ ing the voices of the community and those with lived Child Welfare experience in planning and in decision -making Creat ing a shared vision for how meaningful partnership will promote improved child and family outcomes Child Welfare is constantly looking for ways to assess how policies, rules, organizati onal culture, and practices are contributing to inequitable outcomes. Among the division's priorities are: Better honoring the sovereignty of Oregon Tribal Nations, Re-envisioning and increasing the use of culturally relevant services and support s, Incre asing the inclusion of and sharing power with those most impacted by child welfare systems and reviewing all policy, rules, and procedures for evidence of unintended contributors to equitable outcomes. Funding The Governor's Budget (GB) for Child Welfare is $975.8 million General Fund and $1. 59 billion total funds for the 2023-25 biennium. Major changes from 2021 -23 LAB to 20 23-25 GB are driven mainly by: Standard inflation Forecasted Cost per Case and Caseload changes FF to GF fund shift related to changes in Federal Fund Match Rates General Fund backfill of capped federal fund sources Statewide rate adjustments Reductions to meet the statewide General Fund budget Investment into Policy Option Packages Strategic Funding Investments and Adjustments The Child Welfare Division's mission is to ensure every child and family is empowered to live a safe, stable, and healthy life. This mission is based on a set of beliefs and core values: We believe our child welfare agency and i ts dedicated and diverse partners can better ensure people's safety, health, and well- being if they work in constant collaboration and proactively engage individuals, families, and communities. We believe children , youth and young adults do best growing up in a family. We believe when families and communities are strong, fewer children experience 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page |3 Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare Programs Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare Budget Narrative abuse and neglect. We believe earlier, less intrusive support for families means more children can remain safe and healthy at home and in school, where they can maintain the bonds and connections that are critical to their well-being, leading to better long - term outcomes for children and young adults. We believe families and communities working together in a more proactive, holistic way will also help free up budget and staff resources. This allows ODHS and its partners to allocate resources in ways that have the greatest impa ct for children and young adults. Integrating services will mean less need for costly foster care, residential placements, and other crisis support, creating opportunities for more innovation, creative solutions, and new business models. POP 118 Increa se Child Safety Children thrive when they have safe and supportive family structures in which to grow up. According to Oregon's May Child Welfare Progress Report, about 4,000 times every month Child Protective Services staff engage with families to identif y whether children are being exposed to an unmanaged safety threat. Key ingredients in achieving our Child Welfare Division's Vision for Transformation are accurate assessments of child safety and in- home support to prevent placements away from family and community, but Child Welfare needs more staff to ensure that every family receives in- depth assessment and that safety threats are accurately identified. Current staffing levels make it difficult for staff to meaningfully engage with families, understand their specific needs, and develop customized safety plans - all tasks that require time, care, and skill. Without the staffing necessary to carry out these labor -intensive tasks, we may fail to identify safety issues and support families appropriately in addressing them, thus increasing the likelihood that a child will enter foster care - an often -traumatizing outcome that disproportionately affects Black and Native American families. A staffing investment is necessary to meet the goal in the Oregon Caseload Ratio Standards that each CPS caseworker is assigned no more than 7 new assessments per month (1:7 ratio). The investment will ensure critical caseworker capacity for family engagement, assessment, safety planning, and ongoing support - helping to make su re that children have the best 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page |4 Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare Programs Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare Budget Narrative chance of growing up in a safe and nurturing family. POP 11 9 Parent Alcohol & Drug Support Services Children do best when they grow up in a family within their community. However, substance use disorder (SUD) among parents is one of the greatest challenges to keeping children safe and healthy at home. This POP aligns with recommendations from the Oregon Alcohol and Drug Policy Commission that aim to reduce Oregon's substance use disorder r ate and increase Oregon's recovery rate. It builds capacity for the agency to better respond to the growing complexity of substance use disorder (SUD) among child welfare parents and creates capacity for building more consistent and efficient relationships with community partners and SUD treatment providers. When parents in the ODHS child welfare system can access treatment quicker, be supported in achieving recovery, and be assisted in sustaining their recovery from addiction, there will be fewer foster pl acements and improved child safety and family stability. ODHS will also increase the internal expertise to respond to a variety of issues that combine with parental and adolescent SUD, including various mental health challenges and the need for clean and sober housing. This proposal will also grow expertise on drug testing, engaging parents, and partners, and sustaining community treatment relationships that work with parents and adolescents. These positions will also provide ODHS with needed consultation regarding resource family applicants who may have SUD histories or current use concerns. Estimated need: reclass 25 SSS -1s to SSS -2s and add 8 new positions. POP 122 FOCUS Expansion Children deserve to grow up in their own communities, where their established connections with family, friends, teachers, and others can support their well-being. But children with complex needs are more likely to be placed outside their communities in order to receive specialized services. This proposal seeks to strengthen the well- being of Oregon families through intensive community- based support services for children with complex needs, allowing them to remain in their own communities in a resource home, relative care, or parent's home. These services will provide coaching, training and support to caregivers and individualized services specific to the child's needs to help keep the child in stable, community -based, and familial placements as well as reduce the risk of placement 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page |5 Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare Programs Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare Budget Narrative disruption, Temporary Lodging, and the use of higher levels of care, including residential treatment. This proposal, if approved, will allow for services to be developed throughout the state, including in rural communities. In the long term, these services will prevent unnecessary foster care placements, support families, improve the retention of resource parents, and ultimately save the state money through effective early intervention and partnerships with other systems. The services included in this proposal are Child Specific Caregi ver Services, Response and Support Network (RSN), Community -based supports for Commercial Sexually Exploited Children (CSEC) youth and Multidimensional Transition Services. This proposal requests funding and resources necessary to implement, oversee and audit these services. POP 123 FC/Resource Parent Reimbursement Rates All children deserve to grow up in a family. If a child is not able to remain in their own home, we need resource families who are diverse and affirming and can provide the support a child needs within their communities. Resource families receive a monthly payment, but the rates for Foster Care have not been adjusted since 2018. In 2018, the rates were based on 56.5% of the cost of raising a child at the USDA rate. Cost of living and inflation rates have continued to climb. The rate is intended to cover costs of food, shelter, clothing, school supplies, extracurricular activities, etc. for children in ODHS foster care. Resource Families have voiced to ODHS that the current rate does not cover the actual cost of caring for a child. The policy option package would bring the basic family foster care rate up to 64 % of the cost of care to raise a child. The rate would change at each biennium to include regular inflation and additionally, medical, and professional inflation. This would allow for increases every biennium. Increasing the rates could help attract and retain more resource families and help current resource families cover the cost of care. Conclusion We want to break the cycle that causes harm to individuals and drives Oregonians into expensive state -sponsored programs. Our strategies focus on helping ensure that Oregonians are safer in the future than they are today by increasing resources proven to result in the greatest reducti on in overall risk. Though those strategies require some upfront, taxpayer investment, we are committed to being accountable for needed service delivery and performance metrics focused on improvements in 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page |6 Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare Programs Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare Budget Narrative the lives of those we serve and long-term reductions in the demand for state services. We know that abuse and neglect will never totally be eliminated, but we believe that Oregon should be a place where our children, are safe, and we believe our budget proposal will improve the state's ability to work with individuals and communities to achieve that goal, while reducing the demand for costly state services in the future. Oregon Department of Human Services Self Sufficiency Programs 2023-25 Ways and Means Page |1 Oregon Department of Huma n Services Self Sufficiency Budget Narrative Overview Oregon Department of Human Services' Building Well -being Initiative (BWBI) is advancing a future where all who live in Oregon, regardless of race, identity, age, disability, or place, have the needed supports to achieve whole well- being for self, family, a nd community. In alignment with the agency -wide BWBI, Self -Sufficiency Programs (SSP) is working toward a future where its services and resources are centered around whole -person well- being. This represents a fundamental shift from SSP's previous system -centered approach in which services and resources are primarily shaped by federal programs and funding sources like TANF and SNAP. As we move the person or family to the center of our work, federal programs like these become tools in a suite of resources to help families meet their basic needs and achieve economic stability. This approach acknowledges the complexity of needs that must be met if individuals and families are to thrive in our economic and social climate - including stable housing, affordable ch ildcare, and adequate cash resources. Without these basic supports, individuals and families cannot be expected to exit poverty. In Oregon, the burden of poverty is not equally shared: Communities of Color are disproportionally impacted as are residents of rural communities, women, youth, LGBTQ communities, people with disabilities, immigrants, and refugees. SSP recognizes the structural racism and oppression embedded within our programs and is committed to addressing historic and current harms while working with impacted communities to transform these systems. With this transformation, individuals and families can not only reach stability but also have access to asset- building tools, generational wealth, and equal economic and social mobility opportunitie s. The programs within SSP include: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and related programs: o SNAP Employment and Training Program (STEP) o Able -Bodied Adults without Dependents (ABAWD) Program o SNAP Nutrition Education (SNAP -Ed) Commodities Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) Oregon Department of Human Services Self Sufficiency Programs 2023-25 Ways and Means Page |2 Oregon Department of Huma n Services Self Sufficiency Budget Narrative The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and related programs: o Job Opportunity and Basic Skills (JOBS) program o Family Support and Connections (FS&C) o State Family Pre -Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Supplemental Security Disability Income (SSDI) Temporary Assistance for Domestic Violence Survivors (TA-DVS) Youth Ser vices Child Care (moving to Division of Early Learning and Care in 2023) Seeking Self-Sufficiency SSP administers an array of programs to Oregonians experiencing low or no income. These benefits and services are aimed at helping individuals and families move out of poverty into economic stability. Historically, SSP's programs have operated within silos - each with its own unique resources, policies, processes, and systems. This approach has created a fractured service array and presents challenges to individuals and families as they navigate multiple programs and services. SSP is now taking steps to unify its service approach, thereby improving the accessibility and navigability of its programs. The launch of the ONE eligibility system and the Oregon Eligi bility Partnership (OEP) represents the first wide -scale attempt to weave together department- wide services for individuals and families. We acknowledge that there is still a long way to go. We also acknowledge that federal programs alone are not enough to move individuals and families into economic stability, a key social determinant of health. SSP needs added capacity and state investment to build policy and programs in partnership with impacted communities to better collaborate with community partners and our sister agencies to coordinate a comprehensive suite of services that meaningfully improve well- being for Oregonians. SSP continues to see increased caseloads driven by the shortage of affordable housing, the COVID- 19 pandemic, catastrophic wildfires, economic conditions, and a shortage of available and affordable childcare and attainable living- wage jobs. Recent forecasting data also predict that the current economic downturn will Oregon Department of Human Services Self Sufficiency Programs 2023-25 Ways and Means Page |3 Oregon Department of Huma n Services Self Sufficiency Budget Narrative deepen these trends.1 SSP is committed to creating an integrated human service continuum of care that addresses these compounding trends and serves the holistic needs of individuals and families. To do this, we must think differently and creatively, listen more effectively to communities, and collaborate across multiple s ystems to create and coordinate services. We must also allocate more resources toward the most impacted communities to reduce systemic disparities. In other words, our work is larger than the programs we currently administer; we must focus on holistically improving the conditions in people's environments, from food security to housing security to wealth building. The social determinants of health are foundational to the well -being of individuals and families 2 and SSP policies and programs must be structured to address that reality. In addition to maintaining and optimizing federal program administration, SSP is arranging our broader policy work around food security, housing security, economic and social mobility, equitable budgeting and implementation, and data. In our future vision, we are committed to investing in communities across all aspects of peoples' lives.

Oregon Department of Human Services Aging and People with Disabilities Programs 2023-25 Ways and Means Page |1 Oregon Department of Huma n Services Aging and People with Disabilities Budget Narrative Overview The Department of Human Services Aging and People with Disabilities (APD) program mission is to help Oregonians in their own communities achieve well- being and independence through opportunities that protect, empower, respect choice, and preserve dignity. The state of Oregon is a leader in long term care systems and was ranked number four nationally in AARP's latest ranking done in 2020 . In 1981 Oregon received the first waiver nationwide for long term care services allowing Oregonians receiving Medicaid to choose services in their own home or their communities rather than an institutional such as a nursing home. In 2013, Oregon transitioned most of its services into the 1915(K) State Plan Option. The K Option provides significant benefits to the State in cost savings and allows Oregonians individual choices to best serve their needs. Oregonian's value receiving long term care services in a non- institutional setting with nearly 88% choosing alternatives that allow them to remain independent and safe. Long Term Care Setting (as of March 2022 ) # of Recipients % of LTC Case load Nursing Facility 3,788 11.43 % In Home 17,339 52.30 % 12,024 36.27 % Total 33,151 100.00% Oregon's population is aging The aging population is growing rapidly. The number of people 65 and older in the United States is expected to increase to 70 million by 2030, and to 88.5 million or 20 percent of the population in 2050. The aging population in Oregon will continue to grow dramatically as more baby- boomers reach retirement age. In 2016, approximately 17 percent of Oregon's population was 65 years or older. By 2030, the percentage is expected to increase to nearly 20 percent. In addition, nearly 10 percent of Oregon's population that is younger than 65 is living with a disability. Further, in Oregon, people 85 years or older make up a small but rapidly growing group within the total population. Oregon Department of Human Services Aging and People with Disabilities Programs 2023-25 Ways and Means Page |2 Oregon Department of Huma n Services Aging and People with Disabilities Budget Narrative Guided by the ODHS Equity No rth Star, APD programs and services continue to evolve through a focus on equity and inclusion for individuals of all races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, gender identities and expressions, disabilities, ages, geographic locations, and Tribal affiliations. By working closely with communities to design and deliver services, APD helps ensure that all of Oregon's older adults and people with disabilities have access to the supports they need to achieve and maintain whole well -being. We have prepared a str ategic budget to focus on continuing modernization and improvements to help Oregonians sustain long term care services, become more independent and safer. Funding The cost to operate the Aging and People with Disabilities (APD) Governor's Budget (GB) is $1,59 billion general funds and $4.86 billion total funds for the 2023- 25 biennium . Major changes from 2021- 23 LAB to 2023-25 GB are driven by: Phase -in of rate increases and new programs from 21- 23 Phase -out of funding for one -time activities related to COVID -19 Standard inflation Above Standard Inflation for In- Home, CBC and Nursing Facilities Forecasted Cost per Case and Caseload changes including AAA staff funding FF to GF fund shift related to changes in Federal Fund Match Rates Backfill of one -time American Rescue Plan Act ( ARPA ) funding for ongoing program activities Statewide rate adjustments Reductions to meet the statewide General Fund budget Investment into Policy Option Packages Strategic Funding Investments and Adjustments The following Independence, Safety and Health investments were funded in the Governor's budget to improve services to Oregonians: Oregon Department of Human Services Aging and People with Disabilities Programs 2023-25 Ways and Means Page |3 Oregon Department of Huma n Services Aging and People with Disabilities Budget Narrative POP 105 - Healthier Oregon Program (HOP) Everyone in Oregon deserves access to the services they need, when they need them, to achieve well -being. More importantly, access to services needs to remain uninterrupted as people move through each stage of life and regardless of identity or place. Oregon Department of Human Services is requesting funding to provide long-term services and supports to eligible children and adults with disabilities regardless of their immigration status as directed by HB 3352, formerly called Cover All People, and renamed \"Healthier Oregon\". This POP includes continuation of funding for population enrolled during 2022 through initial implementation of the program (ages 19 to 26 and 55+) and expansion of the services to the remainder of the age groups, including children, starting July 1, 2023. It also asks for ongoing funding for staff to help individuals access these services and supports, including case managers, and related staff who are critical to serving this population. Conclusion For the 23-25 biennium, APD is proposing a package of services that promote safety and well-being for Oregon's older adults and people with disabilities. These investments will help ODHS meet the needs of Oregonians in this period of change and growth. Oregon Department of Human Services Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Program 2023-25 Ways and Means Page |1 Oregon Department of Human Services Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Budget Narrativ e Overview The Office of Developmental Disabilities Services (ODDS) provides support across the lifespan to Oregonians. ODDS, partners, and the developmental disabilities community come together to provide services, supports, and advocacy to empower Oregonians with intellectual and developmental disabilities to live full lives in their communities. ODDS serves people with intellectual disabilities (IQ 75 or below) or developmental disabilities such as autism, Down syndrome, and ce rebral palsy. These disabilities are lifelong and have a significant impact on a person's ability to function independently. Some people with I/DD may also have significant medical or mental health needs. Most people with I/DD meet Medicaid financial eligibility requirements. The I/DD program fulfills its mission and carries out its responsibilities while adhering to the following values: Choice, self-determination, and person -centered practices Children and families together Health, safety, and respect Community inclusion and community living Strong relationships Service equity and access ODDS worked with a diverse group of partners representing all areas of the intellectual/developmental disabilities (I/DD) service delivery system to develop a strategic plan that will guide its work for the next biennium and beyond. The strategic planning process resulted in a firm understanding that the person, their family, and the goals they want to achieve remain at the core of our system. As a result of this process, the agency also committed to develop a Service Equity Plan that includes reaching out to underserved populations, removing barriers to access, and providing services by staff who have appropriate cultural and linguistic capacities. ODDS seeks to achieve the following strategic goals: Create a system that is sustainable and easy to use with effective communication and equitable access. Oregon Department of Human Services Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Program 2023-25 Ways and Means Page |2 Oregon Department of Human Services Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Budget Narrativ e Honor and support people to make their own choices about who they want to be and what they want to do in their lives. Support equal opportunity for living options and meaningful employment in an integrated community setting. Provide families the amount and type of supports they need to raise their children at home, or when necessary, in another family home within their community. Support health and safety while people live rich, full lives. History and Future State Oregon is recognized nationally as an innovative leader in developing community- based services for persons with I/DD. Oregon is one of the few states that have no state- or privately -operated, institutional -level services specifically for people with devel opmental disabilities. In fact, the majority of persons with developmental disabilities in Oregon are served in their own home or their family's home. The work of ODDS and its partners and stakeholders aims to achieve a self- directed, family -involved, individually focused, culturally appropriate, and sustainable approach to service. According to the 2020- 21 National Core Indicators' National Adult Family Survey Report and National Child Family Survey Report , people with I/DD and their families report high levels of satisfaction with services when they have increased control, the ability to integrate into their home communities more fully, and the benefits of home and community life. Ongoing input from our partners both nationally and in Oregon indicates that the number of people wit h I/DD -related needs is growing. There also is an increase in the number of people who need services that have co- occurring mental health needs or are coming from the corrections system. Efforts to ensure the long-term sustainability of ODDS programs and services will be essential in meeting these growing needs. To reach underserved and underrepresented communities, moreover, ODDS must continue its efforts to build a diverse workforce capable of delivering linguistically and culturally agile services. Before COVID -19, the Direct Support Professional (DSP) workforce was in crisis with a national staffing shortage. COVID -19 made the situation worse. ODDS took numerous measures to recruit and retain workers throughout the pandemic, including rate increases for care workers and provider agencies, retention Oregon Department of Human Services Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Program 2023-25 Ways and Means Page |3 Oregon Department of Human Services Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Budget Narrativ e incentives, incentives for new care workers, and a recruitment campaign involving the launch of the Impact Oregon website . ODDS expects these workforce shortages to continue after the pandemic and will continue its efforts to increase this vital workforce. In 2021, the Oregon Legislature funded HB 3352, formerly called Cover All People, and renamed Healthier Oregon, to ensure that more Oregonians can access comp rehensive Oregon Health Plan benefits, including long-term services and supports. This program will allow I/DD eligible individuals, regardless of immigration status, to access needed home - and community- based services. Funding The Governor's Budget (GB) to operate the People with Intellectual & Developmental Disability (I/DD) program for the 202 3-25 biennium is $1.66 billion in g enera l funds and $4.63 billion total funds.

The state of Oregon is committed to fair employment practices and non-discrimination. Less than 1% of the sta te's workforce is comprised of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD), because this population faces common, disability -based barriers when trying to access state employment. The Model Employer program is designed to hire people with I/DD into state service. This policy option package (POP) requests dedicated full-time equivalent (FTE) for positions for the Model Employer program. Providing this opportunity for people with I/DD to have access to state employment by removing common ba rriers faced by people with I/DD in the state hiring process and incentivizing hiring managers to utilize this process will increase access to state employment for people with I/DD. Oregon Department of Human Services Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Program 2023-25 Ways and Means Page |5 Oregon Department of Human Services Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Budget Narrativ e POP 128 Supported Parenting Waiver Service (IDD Parents and CW) Our communities are stronger when parents are able to raise their children as independently as possible in their own or family homes. Parents with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD) have long faced overwhelming challenges and have endured discrimination, while being failed by various systems that are intended to support them to have full lives with their children and families in their communities. ODDS proposes a new set of innovative services intended to support parents with I/DD more effectively and keep families together. These new services, \"supported parenting\" would provide person -centered support for parents with I/DD to raise their children independently in their communities. ODDS requests to maintain permanent 2.0 FTEs that are currently temporary American Rescue Plan Act-funded positions for cross -systems coordination with Child Welfare (CW) and other systems to ensure optimal services to parents with I/DD and children involved in the CW system. POP 129 ODDS Systems - Case Management an d Provider Systems In the 2020s, the ability to quickly, transparently, and effectively collect, share, analyze and communicate data is an essential component of providing equitable and accessible human services. The Office of Developmental Disabilities Se rvices (ODDS) lacks a centralized data system to manage the case management services and supports it provides to roughly 32,000 people across Oregon. ODDS seeks position authority and funding to secure a case management system, a universal provider portal, and a robust agency provider system to improve provider reporting capabilities and to replace ODDS' antiquated ASPEN system that will be shut down in one year. These system upgrades will improve ODDS' service delivery on many levels, some of which include communications, quality assurance, licensing, data collection and equitable access to case management services and supports. Conclusion This proposal represents a substantive level of strategic planning that will allow the I/DD system to improve the quality of service it offers to Oregonians with intellectual/developmental disabilities and their families that support them. The primary focus is on sustainable, quality service programming that accounts for the short- and long-term budget realities that shape our implementation planning. Focusing our efforts on helping people with disabilities remain at home or in their community provides not only financial benefits, but better quality throughout their life. We are confident that this plan will maximize resources and strengthen the service system, enhancing its ability to produce results for those we serve. Oregon Department of Human Services Vocational Rehabilitation Programs 2023-25 Ways and Means Page |1 Oregon Department of Human Services Vocational Rehabilitation Budget Narrative Overview Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) is a state and federal program authorized by state law and the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and amended in 1998 and in 2014 by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA). VR staff work in partnership with Oregonians with disabilities, communities, and businesses to develop employment opportunities and provide individualized services to each eligible person. Employment helps people with disabilities live independently, become involved in their communities, and live more engaged and satisfying lives. VR helps Oregonians with disabilities gain employment through a variety of services. These include but are not limited to: Helping youth with disabilities transition to jobs as they become adults, Providing individualized counseling and supports to job seekers with disabilities to help overcome barriers to employment, Helping employers realize and receive the benefits of employing diverse people with disabilities, and Partnering with other state and local organizations that coordinate and provide equitable employment and workforce programs. All working -age Oregonians who experience a disability and are legally entitled to work are potentially eligible for VR services. Individuals who experience a medical, cognitive, or psychiatric diagnosis that results in a functional impediment to employment are typically eligible. Recipients of Social Security disability benefits are presumed eligible for services. Current Funding Levels The Governor's Budget ( GB) to operate the Vocational Rehabilitation ( VR) program for the 2023-25 biennium is $39.91 m illion in general funds and $148.1 million total funds. Major changes from 2021 -23 LAB to 2023 -25 GB are driven by: Standard inflation Changes in Federal Reallotment funding Backfill use of one -time OF revenue Oregon Department of Human Services Vocational Rehabilitation Programs 2023-25 Ways and Means Page |2 Oregon Department of Human Services Vocational Rehabilitation Budget Narrative Statewide rate adjustments Reductions to meet the statewide General Fund budget Investment into Policy Option Packages VR is funded through the U.S. Department of Education. It receives a formula - based grant with Match and Maintenance of Effort requirements. The match rate for Vocational Rehabilitation is 21.3 percent General Fund; 78.7 percent Federal Funds . For Independent Living the match rate is 10 percent General Fund; 90 percent Federal Fund s. Grant dollars cannot be utilized by other programs. Program income, which is reinvested back into VR, includes Social Security reimb ursement and Youth Transition Program grants. Strategic Funding Investments and Adjustments We have prepared a strategic budget to improve our programs effectiveness and enhance the program's ability to provide further employment outcomes for Oregonians. Continuous program improvements focus on return -on-investment through outcomes for our clients. POP 148 RSA Audit Report Early in 2022 the Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA), VR's federal funders, came to Oregon to conduct a monitoring visit of Oregon Vocational Rehabilitation (VR). Two programs, the Youth Transition Program (YTP) and the Pre-Employment Transition Program (Pre- ETS), were evaluated in this monitoring process with RSA. YTP is a VR administrated program throughout the state. This program establishes contracts between local school districts and the VR program to deliver transition and employment related services to students with disabilities. Currently there are more than 220 schools participating in YTP. And the Pre -ETS Program is available and working with every school district in the state through contracts with local Education Service Districts and o ther Community Based Organizations. The goal of YTP and Pre -ETS is to assist students with disabilities to successfully transition from secondary school into postsecondary education or into competitive integrated employment. Although VR is still awaiting the final audit report from RSA, they indicated there are issues with how the YTP and Pre - ETS programs are operated. For instance, they indicated that VR has Oregon Department of Human Services Vocational Rehabilitation Programs 2023-25 Ways and Means Page |3 Oregon Department of Human Services Vocational Rehabilitation Budget Narrative inappropriately sub- delegated some of its authority through a contract. Therefore, new VR positions will be needed to do the functions previously paid for through contract funding. This issue will be cost neutral but will require position authority. This POP is included to allow for this, and other corrective actions required by the audit to be addresse d. Once the final audit report is received, the POP will be updated. Conclusion As the economy continues to recover from the impact of the pandemic, the focus on workforce development, employment and opportunity for all Oregonians will increase. The Vocational Rehabilitation program welcomes the opportunity to help the growing number of Oregonians with disabilities meet their employment goals , This proposal represents the next phase of strategic investments required to leverage employ ment services to enhance the lives of Oregonians and contribute to local economies. VR will also continue to identify new ways to enhance its work with the Oregon Workforce Investment Board, Local Workforce Investment Boards, and the Workforce Policy cabinet in the implementation of the Oregon Workforce Talent Development Board's strategic plan and local board's efforts to better align economic and workforce development activities. A ll of these efforts will provide greater access for Oregonians who experience disabilities who are seeking competitive integrated employment. This is an intentional approach to equity for people with disabilities as the core mission for VR. 2023-25 Ways and Means Page|1 Oregon Department of Human Services Central and Shared and State Assessments and Enterprise -wide Costs Program Narrative Oregon D epartment of Human Services Central and Shared Services and State Assessments and Enterprise -wide Costs ODHS Mission To help Oregonians in their own communities achieve safety, well -being and independence through opportunities that protect, empower, respect choice , and preserve dignity.

Communications Unit This office supports the agency mission by providing accurate information to 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |6 Oregon Department of Human Services Central Services Program Unit Form employees, clients, legislators, community partners, interest groups, providers, local governments, state and federal agencies, policymakers, news media, targeted audiences, and the public . Effective communication is the primary vehicle to demonstrate public transparency, accountability, and trust. The offic e also provides support to the department's priority projects as defined by the Director and executive team . Government Relations Unit This unit serves the agency's mission by e nsuring that statutory, policy and budget initiatives positively impact Oregonians. Th e government relations team coordinates ODHS legislative matters with , and provides timely and transparent communications to, the Oregon Legislature, Governor's Office, and key community partners.

Program Justification and Link to Focus Areas Outlook Other Federal General FTE 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |9 Oregon Department of Human Services Central Services Program Unit Form Central Services provide critical leadership and business supports necessary to achieve the mission of the agency: helping Oregonians achieve well- being and independence through opportunities that protect, empower, respect choice, and preserve dignity. Cen tral Services include the cost of ODHS Budget, Planning and Analysis, the Director, Governor's Ombudsmen, Legislative and Communications & support, Diversity and Dedicated Human Resources. The ODHS Central Services budgets are structured and administered according to the following principles: Control over major costs The department centrally manages many major costs. Some of these costs, like many DAS charges, are essentially fixed to the agency. Others, like facility rents, are managed centrally to control the costs. Also, the department strongly supports and actively participates in statewide efforts to locate work across the enterprise 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |10 Oregon Department of Human Services Central Services Program Unit Form and install performance management systems to perform administrative functions more efficiently and effectively. Performance management system The department uses a performance ma nagement system containing the following key elements: A clear statement of the outcomes ODHS must achieve , Descriptions of the processes ODHS uses to achieve its outcomes, Measures of success for each outcome and process, Owners for each measure , Written \"breakthrough\" strategies for each initiative that will significantly improve outcomes and processes, A quarterly, all-day, all-leadership review of progress on each measure and strategy, and Best practices in installing performance management require spe cific skills - especially in project management, L EAN tools, data analysis, and professional development of managers. ODHS has reallocated resources and used savings to make some of these investments, but it must increase these skills as much more needs to be done. Program Performance Legal Unit Tort claims are a 60- day timeline for response with agreement from DAS Risk Management on extension. Lawsuits/PJRs operate under court timelines for 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |11 Oregon Department of Human Services Central Services Program Unit Form DOJ to respond. The ODHS Legal Unit also operates under those timelines. It is not tracked as DOJ is the re sponder and can file for extensions or parties can agree to extending timelines. Expunction work and manual tracking began in 1/1/2022 with the new statutory change. The Oregon expunction statutes were amended in 2021 to require a juvenile department init iated automatic expunction process for youths with a juvenile record. As of January 2022, all juvenile departments are required to initiate an automatic expunction for any youth with a juvenile department record who turns age 18 on or after 1/2022. Court issued expunctions have remained steady at an estimated 3 court orders per month statewide with a 21 day from receipt compliance requirement. Currently only two small jurisdictions (Klamath and Benton) are regularly complying with the new requirements for youths turning age 18 on or after 1/2022. For those jurisdictions we receive an average of 5 expunction letters per month. It is estimated that if all juvenile jurisdictions, including the larger jurisdictions of Multnomah, Clackamas, Washington, Lane, a nd Marion, regularly comply with the statutory automatic expunction requirement, ODHS will receive an average of 100 expunction letters per month. This means that the backlog in most juvenile department jurisdictions will hit ODHS in the coming months and through the first half of 2023, increasing the average exponentially. We do not have reliable estimates for this number during the \"catch -up\" phase during the first half of 2023 to clear backlogs. Prior to January 2022 approval of applications for expunction of juvenile records were not automatic. As of January 2022, Senate Bill 575 makes approval of requests for expunction of juvenile records by those persons reaching age 18 prior to January 2022 automatic. ODHS will receive expunction letters on all expunction requests directing ODHS to expunge the subject activities that brought the then minors under the juvenile departments' jurisdiction. The attorney advising the juvenile departments on the new \"automatic expunction on request\" process anticipates average monthly requests to increase. Using a conservative 25% of all eligible \"automatic expunction on request\" cases the estimated increase is 25 expunction letters that ODHS will need to process per month. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |12 Oregon Department of Human Services Central Services Program Unit Form Rules Programs: Rules C oordinators serve all programs, the public, community partners, work with Legislative Coordinators, rule writers, managers to develop the rules and filings.

The allocating grant numbers accumulate costs until the monthly cost allocation process is run. Direct Charge - Costs benefiting a single federal or s tate program are charged directly to the grant numbe r representing the program. There is no additional allocation for these costs. Monthly Process - The process runs each month based on actual accumulated costs. On a monthly basis, statistics are generated to complete the allocation process. The cost all ocation pools are cleared each month by the operation of the cost allocation process to transfer the costs to the final grant and cost objective. Federal Financial Participation (FFP) Calculation - After costs are allocated to final cost objectives, O DHS c alculates an d records the level of Federal Financial P articipation for the specific grant.

This proposal works in partnerships with trauma informed processes to enhance an organizational culture of safety and wellness. Trauma informed care practices and building r esiliency are critical to our workforce, our service recipients, and all Oregonians. Resiliency and Wellbeing is also a part of the work of the Trauma Aware Program. Data shows 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |12 Oregon Department of Human Services Shared Services Program Unit Form that engagement in employee wellness is linked to greater employee retention. I t is also documented that even if an employee does not participate in wellness or wellbeing programs or activities, employees have greater loyalty and believe in their employer. As we create the future of human services in Oregon, it is essential to invest in the wellbeing and resiliency of our employees. Volunteer Services Housed within Shared Services Administration, the Volunteer Program engages individuals in our communities who want to donate their time to improve the lives of others. The mission of t he Volunteer Program is to help achieve the goals and outcomes of ODHS through integrating the work of state and community partners. The program provides on -the-job skills, training, and experience to individuals seeing to further their self -development an d careers , making it essential to the Governor's Economic Recovery Plan, specifically Action 5, Creating Opportunities for Oregonians. The program also supports the agency's community engagement efforts as well as Self -Sufficiency Programs ' Work Experience program, where clients receiving services volunteer to gain valuable on- the-job experience. Program Justification ODHS Shared Services administration (SSA) provides leadership and direction that creat es the foundation and facilitate the integration of equity, well -being, service and inclusion throughout our offices.

Shared Governance ODHS and OHA govern their shared services through committees composed of operational leaders of the two agencies. This approach ensures shared services are prioritized and managed to support program needs. The committee and its subgroups have established service level agreements and performance measures for each service, implemented recent budget cuts selectively, moved staff in and out of shared services to rational ize service delivery, and started implementing more integrated systems to support the performance of all our employees. Best practices in installing performance management require specific skills - especially in project management, Lean tools, data analys is, and professional development of managers. O DHS has reallocated resources and used savings to make some of these investments, but in order to increase these skills much more needs to be done. Enabling Legislation/Program Authorization ORS 409.010 Funding Streams Funding streams are billed through an approved cost allocation plan. The model contains a billing allocation module and a grant allocation module. The billing allocation module allocates Shared Service costs to the two agencies. The billing module allocates costs to customers within each agency. It does not allocate costs directly to Federal grants. The grant allocation module allocates costs within ODHS to State and Federal grants. These costs include those directly incurred by ODHS, Shared Service costs allocated to ODHS by the billing allocation module, and external costs allocated to ODHS by other State agencies. Both modules allocate aggregated costs on a monthly basis and use similar allocation methods. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |33 Oregon Department of Human Services Shared Services Program Unit Form Fundi ng Justification , Significant Changes and Comparison to 23 -25 CSL Due to the timing of the release of GB, details lower than Division level were not available. 2023- 25 Ways and M eans Page |1 Oregon Department of Huma n Services State Asse ssment s and Enterprise -wide Costs Program Unit F orm Oregon Department of Human Services: State Assessments and Enterprise -wide Costs Primary Long -Term Focus Area : Excellence in State Government Secondary Long -Term Focus Area: Program Contact: Eric Moore Program Overview The SAEC budget include s statewide and other enterprise assessments costs such as State Government Service Charges, the enterprise technology services , rent, computer replacement costs and the cost of ODHS /OHA shared services. Program Description ODHS has statewide assessments that include DAS charges such as the State Government Service Charge, Risk Assessment and enterprise technology services Charges. Rent for all of ODHS is in the Facilities budget . This budget includes the computer replacement budget. The Shared Services funding is the revenue for the ODHS portion of ODHS and OHA shared services. When the agency split, ODHS and OHA agreed to share information technology, financial, investigations, and other services to avoid cost increases and permit a greater focus on improving performance and efficiency. Debt services is to pay off Certificates of Participation or Q-Bond loans taken for major ODHS projects. Each service, both shared and assessed, ar e important for ODHS to atta in its programmatic outcomes. It is critical to continue to look for efficiencies in our systems, processes and staffing. This budget also includes the costs of telecommunications, unemployment insurance , mass transit, administ rative hearings and limitat ion for a line of credit from the Treasury Depar tment used for cash flow purposes at the end of the biennium. 2023- 25 Ways and M eans Page |2 Oregon Department of Huma n Services State Asse ssment s and Enterprise -wide Costs Program Unit F orm Program Justification and Link to Focus Areas There is a direct link betwe en this program and Excellence in State Go vernment focus area. ODHS strives to c ontrol major program support costs. ODHS centrally manages many major costs. Some of these costs, like many DAS charges, are fixed to the agency. Other costs , such as facility rents, are centrally control led. ODHS also strongly supports and activel y participates in statewide efforts t o locate work across the enterprise and install performance management systems to perform administrative functions more efficiently and effectively. Program Performance ODHS is committed to customer -driven shared ser vices. When the agency split, ODHS and OHA agreed to maintain many administrative functions as shared services to prevent cost increases, maintain centers of excellence, and preserve standards that help the agencies work togethe r. ODHS and OHA govern their shared services through a joint comm ittee composed of operational leaders of the two agencies. This approach ensures that shared services are prioritized and managed to support program needs. The committee and its subgroups ha ve established service level agreements and performance measure s for each service, moved staff in and out of shared services to rationalize service delivery, and begun implementing more integrated systems to support the performance of all our employees. ODHS pays for services from the Department of Administrative ser vices including general charges and costs of the enterprise technology services. ODHS also actively supports statewide projects like Workday and OregonBuys intended to make government more effic ient and cost effective. Enabling Legislation/Program Author ization The authorization for these budgets comes from legislative budget bills each biennium. Spending authority for the agency is a part of the general authority granted to the agency through statute and federal law. General ODHS statutes include ORS 4 09.010, ORS 409.110 and ORS 409.160. 2023- 25 Ways and M eans Page |3 Oregon Department of Huma n Services State Asse ssment s and Enterprise -wide Costs Program Unit F orm Funding Streams A mix of state general and federal dollars fund the majority of the services provide d in SAEC many of the areas are assessed to federal funds through a cost allocation pr ocesses.

In alignment with the agency -wide BWB T initiative , Self-Sufficiency Programs (SSP) is working toward a future w here its services and resources are centered around whole -person well- being. This represents a fundamental shift from SSP's previous system -centered approach in which services and resources are pr imarily shaped by federal programs and funding sources like TANF and SNAP . As we move the person or family t o the center of our work, federal programs like these become tools in a suite of resources to help families meet their basic needs and achieve econo mic stability. This approach acknowledges the complexity of needs that must be met if individuals and families are to thrive in our economic and social climate - including stable housing, affordable childcare , and adequate cash resources . Without these basic supports, individuals and families cannot be expected to exit poverty. In Oregon, the burden of poverty is not equally shared : Communities of Color are disproportionally impacted as are residents of rural communities, women, youth, LGBTQ communit ies, people with disabilities, immigrants and refugees. SSP recognizes the structural racism and oppression embedded within our programs and is committed to addressing historic and current harms while working with impacted communities to transform these systems. With this transformation, individuals and families can not only reach stability but also have access to asset - building tools, generational wealth and equal economic and social mobility opportunities. Equity North Star The path to this envisioned future is guided by the ODHS Equity North Star , which 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|2 Oregon Department of Huma n Services Self-Sufficiency Programs Program Narrative puts race and intersectionality at the center of our decisions and positio ns communit ies as shapers of ODHS policies, programs and delivery strategies. S SP recognizes that s olutions must be grounded in the lived experience of families and the balance of decision -making power must be shifted to communities who are most affected . Accordingly, SSP will leverage community engagement efforts to identify shared concerns and community-driven solutions. SSP will act with intentionality, humility, curiosity and respect while ensuring affected communities ' access to complete information and ability to influence the outcomes. Community -driven accountability mechanisms will create greater transparency and invite disempowered groups to shape the future of SSP and its services. Rather than expanding the reach and resources of the agency itself, SSP will invest in partners who are rooted in community and already performing invaluable work. Together with our partners, SSP is committed to addressing the roots of systemic oppression and aligning services and resources around a more eq uitable future. Program - Current State SSP administers an array of programs to Oregonians experiencing low or no income. These benefits and services are aimed at helping individuals and families move out of poverty into economic stability. Historically, SSP's programs have operated within silos - each with its own unique resources, policies, processes and systems. This approach has created a fractured service array and presents challenges to individuals and families as they navigate multiple programs and services. SSP is now taking steps to unify its service approach, thereby improving the accessibility and navigability of its programs. The launch of the ONE eligibility system and the Oregon Eligibility Partnership (OEP) represents the first wide -scale attempt to weave together department- wide services for individuals and families. We acknowledge that there is still a long way to go. We also acknowledge that federal programs alone are not enough to move individuals and families into economic stability, a key social determinant of health. SSP needs add itional capacity and state investment to build policy and programs in partnership with impacted communities, and to better collaborate with community partners and our sister agencies to coordinate a comprehensive suite of services that meaningfully improve well -being for Oregonians. 2023-25 Ways and Means Page|3 Oregon Department of Huma n Services Self-Sufficiency Programs Program Narrative Program - Future State SSP continues to see historic caseloads driven by the shortage of affordable housing, the COVID- 19 pandemic, catastrophic wildfires, economic c onditions and a shortage of available and affordable childcare and attainable living- wage jobs. Recent forecasting data also predict that the current economic downturn will deepen these trends. 1 SSP is committed to creating an integrated human service co ntinuum of care that addresses these compounding trends and serves the holistic needs of individuals and families. To do this, we must think differently and creatively, listen more effectively to communities and collaborate across multiple systems to create and coordinate services. We must also allocate more resources toward the most impacted communities to reduce systemic disparities. In other words, our work is larger than the programs we currently administer; we must focus on holistically improving the conditions in people 's environments, from food security to housing security to wealth building. The social determinants of health are foundational to the well -being of individuals and families 2 and SSP policies and programs must be structured to address that reality. In addition to maintaining and optimizing federal program administration, SSP is arranging our broader policy work around food security, housing security, economic and social mobility, equitable budgeting and implementation, and data. In our future vision, we are committed to investing in communities across all aspects of peoples' lives. 1 Parolin, Z. & Christopher Wimer (April 2020) Forecasting Estimates of Poverty during the COVID -19 Crisis.

SNAP benefits are 100 percent federally funded; however, administration of the program requires a 50 percent state match. Approximately one in five Oregonians receive food benefits through SNAP. Adults 60 and older and pe ople with disabilities who are receiving SNAP in Oregon are served by SSP in partnership with the Aging and People with Disabilities (APD) program and their contracted partners (Area Agencies on Aging (A AAs), Disability Services Offices, and Councils of Government). SNAP is the largest food security program in Oregon and the United States. Recent research has shown that SNAP benefits reduce the depth and severity of poverty and improve diet-related chronic health conditions , lowering medical costs for the individual and the state . 3 SNAP benefits add appro ximately $1.1 billion per year to the Oregon economy, benefiting both urban and rural communities.4 Oregon's Double Up Food Bucks program supports our efforts to stretch SNAP food dollars further for SNAP households. $20 in SNAP can be matched up to $20 in fresh fruit and veggies at participating farmer's markets across the state. Families can find a participating market at doubleuporegon.org. Oregon is federally required to offer an Employment and Training (E&T) program to assist SNAP households in obtaining skills, training and work or experience , which in turn increase s their ability to secure and maintain living -wage employment. Oregon has two voluntary SNAP E&T programs: the SNAP Training and 3 Steven Carlson and Brynne Keith- Jennings, \"SNAP Is Linked with Improved Nutritional Outcomes and Lower Health Care Costs,\" Center on Budget and Public Policies, January 17, Advances in Nutrition: An International Review Journal, 4(2):203 -212, 2013, https://doi.org/10.3945/an.112.003277 4 Calculation based on internal ODHS data and source: Patrick Canning and Brian Stacy, \"The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Economy: New Estimates of the SNAP Multiplier ,\" United States Department of Agriculture, July 2019, https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/93529/err -265.pdf?v=6395.4 2023-25 Ways and Means Page|6 Oregon Department of Huma n Services Self-Sufficiency Programs Program Narrative Employment Program (STEP) - nationally called the SNAP 50/50 program - and the Able -Bodied Adults Without Dependents (ABAWD) program. The ABAWD program establis hes time limits for SNAP participants aged 18 to 49 who can work, do not have a child under 18 as part of their SNAP case and do not live in a waived area.5 Oregon SNAP encompasses several additional programs including the SNAP Nutrition Education (SNAP -Ed) program, which is active in all 36 counties. ODHS oversees SNAP -Ed program and planning, and Implementing Agencies deliver programming and work directly in communities. The state's singular Implementing Agency is Oregon State University Extension Service (OSU ES). Partners at OSU ES live and work in the diverse communities SNAP -Ed serves, including Tribal communities across the state. The focus of SNAP -Ed is directed at school- aged children, with strategic initiatives and supports aimed at serving older adults, Federally Recognized Trib es and other Tribal communities in Oregon, Black communities and other C ommunities of Color. Commodities Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) This federal program provides a prescribed nutritious commodity package each month to help meet the needs of older adults experiencing low income. Food packages are distributed through local agencies and include canned fruits and vegetables, canned meat, poultry and other protein items, and grain products such as pasta and rice. While CSFP food packages do not provide a complete diet, they are a good source of the nutrients many older adults experiencing food insecurity struggle to access , helping these adults combat poor health conditions and avoid hospitalizations and nursing home placements. 6 Recipients are also offered the opportunity to receive nutrition education instruction and information, often in their 5 The law allows states to ask FNS to temporarily waive the ABAWD time limit based on evidence showing that an area has an unemployment rate of over 10 percent or does not have a sufficient number of jobs.

The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) This federal program helps supplement the diets of Oregonians experiencing low income by providing emergency food and nutrition assistance at no cost. The amount of food Oregon receives is based on the number of unemployed persons and the number of people with incomes below the federal poverty level. Oregon SSP provides funding to purchase USDA commodities - as well as administrative funds to support statewide food distribution - to the Oregon Food Bank (OFB), the state's distributing agency. OFB works with a cooperative network of regional food banks, partner agencies and programs to distribute emergency food to families. Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TAN F) The TANF program provides cash benefits and job support services to families with children experiencing deep poverty. These benefits are designed to help meet a family's basic needs while they find or prepare for work. In 2022, the Oregon Legislature a pproved a series of investments put forward by SSP to improve TANF access and cash supports, including: A permanent end to full-family sanctions which deny cash to entire families when the caretaker is \"noncompliant\" with program requirements, A reinvestment of Oregon's TANF reserves into tri-annual clothing allowances that will enable parents to buy seasonally appropriate clothing for their children, and Increasing the resource limit to allow more families to access TANF. SSP also convenes a weekly collaborative session with community partners and Tribal nations to ensure that impacted communities are leading and shaping Oregon's TANF program. Job Opportunity and Basic Skills (JOBS) JOBS is the employment and training component of TANF. It prov ides services for family stabilization, well- being, education, and employment readiness. Family 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|8 Oregon Department of Huma n Services Self-Sufficiency Programs Program Narrative coaches meet with families and connect them to local services such as work experience and on- the-job training; English language classes ; high school, GED, and college degree programs; parenting classes; and medical, mental health, or substance treatment programs. Family Support and Connections (FS&C) FS&C provides support to families experiencing low income to increase protective factors and decrease risks associated with child abuse and neglect. Protective factors include nurturing and attachment, knowledge of parenting and child and youth development, parental resilience, social connections and concrete su pport for parent s. Identifying protective factors helps parents find resources, supports and coping strategies that support effective parent ing even in times of stress, increasing the well- being of children and families. Front -end support and primary and secondary prevention services are used to build upon family strengths, address family functioning and develop skills that lead to self -sufficiency and reduce the need for Child Welfare intervention. In 2022, the Oregon Legislature approved expansion of FS&C funded by TANF Federal Funds, providing an additional $7.3 million dollars to reach more families. With this increased funding, FS&C will expand eligibility requirements and support, intentionally increase cultural responsiveness in services, onboard culturally specific organizations and center parent voice in program design. This expansion will allow FS&C to serve more families, prioritizing Black, Indigenous and families of color. State Family Pre -Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Supplemental Security Disability Income (SSDI) State Family Pre -SSI/SSDI provides temporary cash assistance, case management and professional- level support to TANF -eligible adults and their families. The program is available to participants who have been assessed by t he program's disability analyst s. The program is voluntary but provides additional staff resources for those selected to participate. Selected individuals must sign an interim assistance agreement to repay the adult portion of their State Family Pre -SSI/SSDI grant back to the state when they are found eligible for federal disability program benefits. State Family Pre -SSI/SSDI expenditures are funded with state only, non- Maintenance of 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|9 Oregon Department of Huma n Services Self-Sufficiency Programs Program Narrative Effort dollars. Temporary Assistance to Domestic Violence Survivors (TA- DVS) TA-DVS provides short -term financial assistance and support services to families with children affected by domestic violence when other resources are not available. TA-DVS is used to help domestic violence survivors and their children address their safety concerns and stabilize their living situation. This reduces the likelihood of the survivor returning to the domestic violence situation and can prevent life -threatening situations. This program also includes safety planning and connect ion to community resources. Survivor Investment Partnership (SIP) SIP provides flexible financial assistance to survivors of domestic and sexual violence and builds capacity to expand SSP's support for survivors through collaboration with Tribal nations and culturally specific domestic violence sexual assault (DVSA) prov iders. SIP includes intergovernmental agreements (IGA) with the Nine Federally Recognized Tribes in Oregon, contracts with culturally specific DVSA providers, and flexible funding for survivors that enables supports beyond what ODHS programs can provide. S IP funding allows survivors to access needed supports safely within their communities in a culturally responsive way. Refugee Program The Refugee Program serves individuals and families who have fled persecution in their country of origin and were legally admitted for resettlement by the United States. A collaborative effort between ODHS and partner Refugee R esettlement Agencies (RRAs), the program help s refugees and those eligible for refugee ser vices to successfully resettle in Oregon by providing case management, financial, medical, employment and acculturation services. The Refugee Program began significant rebuilding efforts following the 2020 election and change in administrative direction regarding immigrants and refugees . Crises in Afghanistan and Ukraine have also necessitated the expansion of the Refugee Program's efforts and collaborations with ODHS' Office of Resilience and 2023-25 Ways and Means Page|10 Oregon Department of Huma n Services Self-Sufficiency Programs Program Narrative Emergency Management, as well as the state's RRAs . Youth Services My Future - My Choice (MFMC) MFMC is an age -appropriate, medically accurate, comprehensive, trauma -informed and inclusive sexual health education program developed for the 6th grade. It can be delivered with the support of trained high school peer educators and meets all Oregon sexual health education standards. It supports sexual violence prevention and teen pregnancy prevention efforts to help reduce the need for public assistance in the future. ODHS partners with the Oregon Department of Education, the My Future - My Choice Advisory Committee , and the Teen Advisory Board to further develop and implement the program . Youth Experiencing Homelessness Program (YEHP) YEHP provides services and supports to unaccompanied youth and young adults under the age of 24 without shelter and who are not able to safely reside with a parent or guardian. The program administers funding to local nonprofit providers across the state providing shelter services, drop- in and outreach services, job development and mentoring services, and housing supports such as host homes and transitional living programming. ODHS partners with a cr oss-system advisory group to coordinate statewide policy and planning to address the needs of youth experiencing homelessness. In 2021, ODHS in collaboration with the Corporation for Supportive Housing (CSH) released the results of a statewide analysis that examined the need and pipeline for housing and services for youth experiencing or at risk of experiencing homelessness. 7 Unique in the study was a comprehensive effort to recruit and engage youth across the state with lived experience of homelessness to inform and design housing and services programs that may receive state funding. The project was born from the 2020 session of the Oregon Legislature after a proposed bill requested a study to better understand the level of investment required to address statewide housing and service gaps for young people. 7 https://www.oregon.gov/dhs/CHILDREN/Homeless -Youth/Documents/CSH -YH-Needs.pdf 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|11 Oregon Department of Huma n Services Self-Sufficiency Programs Program Narrative Child Care Eligibility In 2021, the Oregon Legislature passed House Bill 3073, establishing a new early learning agency - the Department of Early Learning and Care (DELC) - that consolidates all childcare programs and early care and education programs in one place , effective July 2023. This consolidation includes the Employment Related Day Care program (ERDC), a childcare subsidy program previously housed in ODHS SSP. ERDC assists families with childcare costs. The program has a dual generational goal of helping families maintain stable employment and education while helping children access high -quality childcare , thus increasing their likelihood of success in school. Families in this program pay a share of the childcare cost, called the copay. The amount of the copay is based on a sliding scale using family size and income. Families may qualify for childcare assistance while they are attending school, searching for a jo b after a lay -off or temporary loss of employment, or during periods of medical leave. ERDC also works with providers and other childcare partners across the state to help families find and keep high- quality childcare , improve the availability of quality childcare in Oregon, and develop resources for families and childcare providers. ODHS has worked closely with the Early Learning Division to implement policies introduced as part of House Bill 3073 and to ensure a smooth transition of ERDC that is seamless for families and providers. After the transition to DELC, ODHS will continue to determine family eligibility for the program through the ONE system. Design and Implementation Design and Implementation (D&I) provides program direction, guidance, planning, implementation, and training. D&I staff coordinate closely with central SSP office staff in Salem as well as service delivery offices across the state , with the goal of increas ing Oregonians' access to holistic, person - and equity -centered, and community -based services, programs and supports.

Program Justification Strengthening our Foundations Staff efforts strengthen O DHS foundations through collaborations that continually improve the delivery of basic needs programs, including financial assistance, food assistance, medical insurance (referral only), child care, domestic violence services, employment and training, and refugee and youth services. Staff also 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |4 Oregon Department of Human Services Self -Sufficiency Program Design and Delivery Program Unit Form respond to disaster program delivery when needed and as identified as eligible by federal programs. SSP staff co ordinate with ODHS Child Welfare to work with families that have , or are at risk of having, Child Welfare involvement ; our goal is t o increase family stability and keep children and parents together whenever possible . D&I collaborates with Child Welfare and community partners in designing the least intrusive, most family -centered and culturally responsive service delivery. Additional collaborations have been built around domestic violence, housing, alcohol, drug and mental health treatment, workforce development, vocational rehabilitation, health care and education with community partners and Tribal Nations . ODHS Equity North Star SSP Design and Delivery is guided by the ODHS Equity North Star - with the goal that all who live in Oregon, regardless of race, identity or place, have the resources and support they need to achieve whole well -being for themselves, their families and their communities. SSP staff work to provide services and resources to clients that support their goals in achieving well -being, basic health, safety and independence. Insufficient and ill -designed resources and supports disproportionately impact people with disabilities, Oregon Tribal N ations, Black individuals and families, and other people of color . To ensure resources and services support impacted communities, it is vital to build and maintain an infrastructure that supports family stability and engagement. Program Performance SSP uses a M anagement System to prioritize, connect, enable and drive all work in a way that ensures every resource connects back to our goals and every employee receives the maximum authority to act to achieve those goals. In 2019, the Oregon Legislature approved new SSP Key Pe rformance Measures (KPMs). Connecting to economic stability - a key social determinant of health - the KPMs track the following outcomes for SSP clients: 1. Housing stability 2. Food security 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |5 Oregon Department of Human Services Self -Sufficiency Program Design and Delivery Program Unit Form 3. Living wages 4. Hope/self -efficacy SSP's Fundamentals Map outlines the program's mission critical functions and operating principles. Operating and Supporting Processes each have their own distinct Process Measures. Process and Outcome measures described in the map are reviewed through a Quarterly Target Review (QTR) process to help SSP manage, make decisions, and understand the \"why\" behind our efforts. Disaggregated measures help SSP track the programs' ability to meet the needs of all populations served and to make necessary improvements. In addition to the four Key Perform ance Measures, SSP's work is evaluated based on the following: Operating Processes OP1 Fostering community and partner relationships OP2 Developing and maintaining resources OP3 Determining eligibility OP4 Developing and supporting participant goals OP5 Engaging individuals Supporting Processes SP1 Developing and implementing policy SP2 Evaluating and improving performance SP3 Managing business operations SP4 Retaining a strong and professional internal workforce Outcome Measures O1 Highly engaged, skilled, professional workforce O2 Workforce reflects communities O3 Strong sustainable and outcome -oriented community relationship O4 Improved economic stability O5 Safe, stable, attached families O6 Increased family goal attainment O7 Awareness and access to ser vices O8 External customer satisfaction In alignment with the agency -wide BWBI, the SSP's Fundamentals Map and the Key Performance, Process and Outcome Measures it contains, assist the program 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |6 Oregon Department of Human Services Self -Sufficiency Program Design and Delivery Program Unit Form in understanding how we can build a future where all our servic es and resources are centered around whole -person well- being. Enabling Legislation: SSP must act in accordance with a variety of mandates from federal law and the Oregon constitution. SNAP and Medicaid are federally mandated programs. TANF is a federal block grant program. It is authorized under Title IV -A of the Social Security Act, as amended by the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA), and the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. A significant portion of the TANF eligibility criteria is codified in State statute chapters 411 and 412. ODHS has statutory authority to administer the ERDC program through ORS 409.010(2) (c), 411.141 and 418.485. Family Support and Connections services are authorized through the Title II of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), as amended by P.L. 111- 320. Funding Streams: Funding for personnel for Program Delivery and Design is determined through Random Moment Sampling Surveys to identify which programs are being worked on in the moment and the funding split for administration of the program. With RMSS, field delivery staff are require d at random intervals to indicate the time spent on various activities to determine the level of federal funding which directly supports our ability to provide Self -Sufficiency Program services. The funding is a mixture of federal and General Fund dollars that cover the work done by the employees to support the programs that they work in. The main grant used is SNAP Administration funded 50 percent f ederal and 50 percent General Fund. TANF funds are also used. Funding Justification and Significant Changes from CSL to ARB Due to the timing of the release of GB, details lower than Division level were not available. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |1 Oregon Department of Human Services Self -Sufficiency Program Oregon Eligibility Partnership Program Unit Form Oregon Department of Human Services: Virtual Eligibility Center - OHP unit Primary Long Term Focus Area: Accurate and equitable ONE eligibility determinations Secondary Long Term Focus Area: Timely call times and benefit issuance Program Contact: Nathan Singer Program Overview The Oregon Health Plan (OHP) unit makes up a portion of ODHS' s tate and contract staff who make eligibility determinations for OregonEligibility (ONE) programs , which include medical , food, c ash and child care assistance . These staff are primarily assigned to our Virtual Eligibility Center (VEC), which takes statewide calls and works on applications submitted online. They are part of a larger network which includes local Aging and Peopl e with Disabilities (A PD) and Self-Sufficiency Programs (S SP) offices and Type B Transfer AAAs, all of which determine eligibility for benefits statewide. These units currently serve the highest caseload in Oregon history with almost 1.5 million individual s receiving some level of benefit(s). Throughout this VEC and OHP unit will be used synonymously. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |2 Oregon Department of Human Services Self -Sufficiency Program Oregon Eligibility Partnership Program Unit Form Program Description The VEC staff respond to client inquiries about their applications and coverage for medical, food, cash and child care eligibility . They are the voice and primary ambassadors for these programs, providing clients with resource s by telephone or the clients' other preferred method s of contact. Customers typically inquire about their application status, information on their benefits and coordination of other benefits or services . They also call to make changes in their personal information that may affect their elig ibility. These staff and the ONE eligibility system serve some of Oregon's most impacted populations, taking applications online, through the mail, over the phone or in an office . These staff focus on honoring individuals' choices about how they want to engage with us, and on bringing the right resources to the people we serve, rather than making them navigate multiple agencies and divisions to get the benefits they need . Currently we serve almost 1.5 million individuals, with about 48 percent of individuals submitting applications online through our statewide applicant portal. This includes every generation of individuals from newborns to individuals seeking long -term care or eligibility for end -of-life hospice care. We have provided more benefit dollar s for food assistance through pandemic and emergency allotments than during any pre -pandemic period . This unit also works to support Heritage Native Americans and Oregon Tribal Nations. This unit also supports work within ODHS' Oregon Eligibility Partnership (OEP) , which is the program area bringing eligibility information together across agencies, so that staff have a single resource for direction related to eligibility operations . OEP is also responsible for maintaining the ONE system, coordinating gover nance, operational direction, quality assurance , hearings, and more. Note that some of these functions currently reside in other budget areas. This unit and our staff currently are supporting a historic caseload. The percentage of staff to cases and support to do this work is the highest ratio of cases per worker we have ever seen, and the need to unwind the pandemic will bring unparalleled operational pressure which will cause longer call times and delays in benefits and backlogs. ODHS's requests in these budgets are critical to ensuring Oregonians can receive accurate and timely benefits determinations that are provided in an equitable fashion. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |3 Oregon Department of Human Services Self -Sufficiency Program Oregon Eligibility Partnership Program Unit Form Program Justification This program is the front door for many in Oregon who need assistance to reach their potential and achieve and maintain health, safety and independence. This program is essential to our core work, providing individuals with benefits and also improving service equity by captur ing REAL+D information, honor ing actual name versus legal name, and providing application options in mu ltiple languages . Program Performance The VEC staff answer calls from individuals needing assistance with applying for, redetermining and information related to m edical, food, cash and child care benefits. Oregon has seen historic growth in our OHP caseload and continued growth in applications. As of fall 2022 , Oregon was receiving on average 6 0,000 new applications requesting benefits, 130,000 redeterminations coming due and over 120,000 changes each month. Below is the growth of OHP alone since the pandemic. From July 2020 through April 2022 Oregon received over 2,131,801 tasks to take some action around a new application, redetermination or change to someone's 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |4 Oregon Department of Human Services Self -Sufficiency Program Oregon Eligibility Partnership Program Unit Form eligibility within the ONE system. During that time the team ha s been able to process 2,124,005 of those tasks. The graph below shows the impact of tasks processed and received. It is important to note that redeterminations for medical had no negative action associated with them during the COVID -19 Public Health Emergency , and so tasks could be closed for those and other SNAP related tasks during this time in order to assist with keepi ng up with the historic volume of cases. During a similar timeframe the VEC 800 number received 1,924,548 calls, staff were able to answer 1,074,642 of those calls. Note that callers may have hung up due to wait times or calls may have disonnected pri or to being able to answer, local offices also receive calls from individuals around eligibility and those calls are not included in these numbers. During this timeframe the average wait time was 19 minutes for calls answered, average maximum wait time for calls answered was 2 hours and 5 minutes, and the average answer rate was 56 percent . It is important to note that the group answering these calls have not been receiving additional staff for growth or were reflected in the Department's eligibility workload model since transferring back from OHA, and have the highest caseload to worker ratio of any 020000400006000080000100000120000140000160000180000Received vs Processed Tasks in ONE Outstanding Tasks on the 1st of each month *SELG tasks created and completed by datafix in the month of March were removed Processed Received Outstanding tasks2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |5 Oregon Department of Human Services Self -Sufficiency Program Oregon Eligibility Partnership Program Unit Form of our eligibility areas and this is the highest since the ODHS first started reporting on those ratios decades ago.

These goals have set the tone - and the primary long-term focus area - for Self- Sufficiency Programs ' (SSP) efforts and legislative priorities. In addition, SSP is guided by the ODHS Equity North Star1 and by the agency's Building Well- being Initiative (BWBI) to advance a future that all who live in Oregon, regardless of race, identity or place, have the resources and support they need to achieve whole well- being for themselves, their families and their communities. SSP recognizes that our efforts must be grounded in the lived experience of individuals and families in Oregon and the balance of decision- making power must be shifted to communities who are most affected. Accordingly, SSP will leverage community engagement efforts to identify shared concerns and community-driven solutions. SSP will act with intentionality, humility, curiosity and respect while ensuring affected communities' access to complete information and ability to influence the outcomes. SSP uses a M anagement System to prioritize, connect, enable and drive all work in a way that ensures every resource connects back to our goals and every e mployee receives the maximum authority to act to achieve those goals. In 2019, the Oregon Legislature approved new SSP Key Performance Measures (KPMs).

Program Description: Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program Contact : Annette Palmer Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) is a public cash assistance program for children and their parent or caretaker experiencing low income. TANF is supported by both TANF Federal Funding and State General Funds. The program is designed to offer families assistance to meet their basic needs while they work toward economic stability. In addition to the cash portion of the 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |5 Oregon Department of Hum an Services Self -Sufficiency Program s Program Unit Form program, TANF provides a wide range of services and programs, some of which include: Support services to assist with urgent ne eds like rent and utilities and general needs like clothing and transportation for skill development and employment . Jobs Participation Incentive (JPI) program, a state funded employment program that provides an additional $10.00 in SNAP benefits to families with children . Employment Payments, a cash program provided to families with TANF benefits closed due to employment. Payments are spread over a three -month period following the closure of TANF benefits. State funded Pre -Supplemental Security Income (SF P) program, provides cash assistance, case management and professional level support assistance with the Social Security Administration application process. Program Justification Strengthening our Foundations The program administers day- to-day operations and delivery of TANF benefits and services to eligible families living in poverty and connects families to community resources and contracted services. Families can take part in personalized assessments to assist in goal development and exploration of pathways to economic stability and a future beyond S elf-Sufficiency Program benefits. Transitional services are provided, lessening the benefit cliff often associated with leaving TANF. Responding to E mergencies Throughout the COVID -19 public health emergency (PHE), TANF program eligibility processes and rules were amended to minimize additional program impacts on families. The COVID- 19 PHE provided an opportunity for Oregon's TANF program to look at future readiness and response tactics in times of crisis. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |6 Oregon Department of Hum an Services Self -Sufficiency Program s Program Unit Form Creating the Future of H uman Services, ODHS Equity North Star SSP is engaging in a redesign of the state's TANF program, collaborating with advocates, contracted partners, Tribal partners and individuals with lived experience to build a robust and equitable infrastructure. The redesign will ensure community is involved at every step of program design, delivery and implementation with families at the center of decision making. Community listening sessions and ot her engagement practices guarantee the voices of families currently receiving TANF - and who have received TANF in the past - will be woven throughout the program's future design. Community Engagement The TANF program works with Tribal Nations and communit y partners to provide appropriate services to current TANF participants and as part of the ongoing TANF redesign process. The TANF program continues to invest funds into efforts that maximize benefit dollars targeted at building participant development in work related activities, identifying and building on skills and leveraging community collaborations to provide solid foundations that lead to employment retention and advancement. Community engagement and lived experience voices are valued to develop and deliver a more equitable program. Program Performance TANF program performance is measured using the following Self -Sufficiency measures: OP2 - Core resources available OP3 - Timely issuance of SNAP benefits and a ll benefits OP4 - Assessments completed OP4 - Participants with active plan steps OP5 - Participant show rate to appointments OP5 - Family/Participant involvement OP5 - Customer interaction reflect service equity SP1 - Developing and implementing policy SP2 - Accuracy of benefits SNAP, TANF, ERDC SP3 - Program spending with SSP spending Plan O2 - Workforce parity to communities O4 - Living wage jobs O7 - Eligible < 18-year-olds receiving TANF 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |7 Oregon Department of Hum an Services Self -Sufficiency Program s Program Unit Form Enabling Legislation The TANF program is authorized under Title IV- A of the Social Security Act, as amended by the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) and the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. A significant portion of the TANF eligibility criteria is codified in state statute chapters 411 and 412. Program Description: Refugee Program Program Contact: Annette Palmer The Refugee Program serves individuals and families in immigration categories approved by the Federal Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR): Refugees, Asylees, Cuban/Haitian entrants and parolees, Amerasians, victims of human trafficking (international) and certain family mem bers, Iraqi/Afghan Special Immigrant Visa holders and certain Parolees. The program provides cash assistance and medical assistance to refugees who are ineligible for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) cash assistance and Medicaid. The program partners with Refugee Resettlement Agencies (RRA) and nonprofit community -based organizations to provide additional services. Resettlement services are comprehensive. Initial resettlement and case management services are delivered by RRAs located in the Portland and Salem areas, where many refugees first seek services. These services may include essential tasks such as picking up refugees at the airport, finding them a place to live and helping to furnish their home with the necessities. Employment -related services are delivered by the Immigrant and Refugee Community Organization (IRCO). IRCO services include job search assistance, employment acculturation, pre-employment training, English language classes, citizenship and naturalization assistance. Those se rved through the Refugee Program come from all over the world. During FFY 2021, Oregon's Refugee Program assisted people from 25 different countries. Most refugees who are resettled in the U.S. speak little to no English. Limited English capacity is expect ed and integrated into Refugee Program services. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |8 Oregon Department of Hum an Services Self -Sufficiency Program s Program Unit Form Program Justification Strengthening our Foundations The Refugee Program administers benefits and services offered to refugees once they arrive in the U.S. Cash and medical assistance, employment services and acculturation services provide needed supports for refugees to restart their lives in the U.S. The Refugee P rogram works in collaboration with other ODHS programs, resettlement agencies, the Social Security Administration and community- based organizations to ensure families and individuals receive needed services and have a strong support system. Responding to Emergencies As overseas emergencies and disasters occur, many people seek protection in the U.S. The Refugee Program p rovides benefits and services while working with ODHS' Office of Resilience and Emergency Management (OREM), local resettlement agencies, community- based organizations and other government agencies to provide effective assistance to refugee communities. These collaborations are vital to ensuring families and individuals receive emergent services quickl y. Creating the Future of Human Services The Refugee Program is expanding its contracted provider network to include more community -based organizations alongside the state's resettlement agencies. This brings a broad service array and additional culturally specific services to refugee communities. The Refugee Program is working collaboratively with Oregon's Office of Immigrant and Refugee Advancement to further develop and evolve the future of the program. ODHS Equity North Star Refugees coming to the U.S. have faced oppression and persecution in their country of origin. The Refugee Program aims to provide benefits and services with equity , accessibility and a trauma- informed approach . ODHS collaborates with RRAs and community organizations to support refugees. RRA staff and community partners represent a diverse population from a variety of cultures and many have experienced the resettlement process firsthand a s refugees themselves. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |9 Oregon Department of Hum an Services Self -Sufficiency Program s Program Unit Form Community Engagement The Refugee Program works directly with community -based organization s, RRAs , ODHS district office s and attends in -person and virtual listening sessions to hear directly from Oregon's communities and refugees a bout their needs and experiences. Collaboration and information meetings occur frequently and are need -based . This is ensure s ongoing dialogs and collaborations are in place to serve the refugee populations more equitably in Oregon. Program Performance The Refugee Program is not currently included in SSP's QTR measures and outcomes due to historic program structure and computer system integration. The program is in the process of building and maintaining data dashboards and updating its data collection system to broaden the scope of information that can be gathered. These additions will move the Refugee Program toward building QTR measures. Enabling Legislation/Program Authorization The Refugee Program is authorized and operates under the Federal Immigration and Nationality Act and the Refugee Act (8 U.S.C. 1522). The Refugee Program operates as a public assistance program under ORS 411.060, 409.010(2) (c) and 409.010(2) (h). Program Description: Domestic Violence Programs Program Contact: Kirstin Holman SSP Domestic Violence Programs include three unique programs that support domestic violence and sexual assault (DVSA) survivors in crisis , provide ongoing safety planning and connect survivors to DVSA experts. Temporary Assistance for Domestic Violence Survivors (TA-DVS) TA-DVS p rovides short -term financial assistance, safety planning and connection to community resources for families affected by domestic violence when other resources are not available. TA-DVS is used to help domestic violence survivors and their children address their safety concerns and stabilize their living situation. This reduces the likelihood of the survivor returning to the domestic violence situation and can prevent life -threate ning situations. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |10 Oregon Department of Hum an Services Self -Sufficiency Program s Program Unit Form Co-located Domestic Violence (DV) Advocates Program The Co -located DV Advocates Program contracts with local D VSA nonprofit agencies. DVSA advocates are housed in Child Welfare (CW) and Self -Sufficiency (SSP) Offices to provide confidential advocacy services to ODHS survivors and staff. Survivor Investment Partnership (SIP) SIP provides flexible financial assistance to survivors of domestic and sexual violence and builds capacity to expand the agency's collaborati ve efforts for survivors with Oregon Tribal Nations and culturally specific DVSA providers. SIP funding allows for survivors to access needed supports safely within their communities in a culturally responsive way. Program Justification Strengthening our Foundation s, Responding to Emergencies By providing financial and community support to help survivors gain stability away from the domestic violence situation, SSP's Domestic Violence Programs strengthen foundations of the individuals, families and communities we se rve. These programs respond to emergencies every day as survivors seek services during crisis periods of experiencing and fleeing domestic violence. Creating the Future of Human Services Developing and enhancing programs such as SIP to meet the needs of survivors in their own communities, works toward creating the future of human services by empowering communities and survivors to navigate their safety in a trauma - informed, equitable and culturally appropriate way. ODHS Equity North Star Domestic Violence Programs partner with communities to develop programs which strive to make services accessible to underserved, culturally specific populations. The SIP program was developed to provide funding to Confederated Tribes of Oregon, as well as culturall y specific DVSA organizations, to give communities autonomy on how best to provide services for their members. Community Engagement Community engagement in all our Domestic Violence Programs continues to be prioritized, including quarterly meetings with c o-located advocates both statewide and on a local level, ongoing collaboration with Oregon Confederated Tribes and 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |11 Oregon Department of Hum an Services Self -Sufficiency Program s Program Unit Form culturally diverse community members, as well as meetings, trainings and advanced education opportunities provided to staff who support families in crisis. Program Performance At this time, no formal QTRs exist for SSP's D omestic Violence Programs due to the unique circumstances and confidentiality of survivors. Staff supporting the program's domestic violence support efforts continue to work on developing measures that will provide data on program efficacy. Enabling Legislation Temporary Assistance for Domestic Violence Survivors (TA-DVS) Domestic violence emergency assistance, also known as TA- DVS, is mandated under ORS 411.117 (1) (e). Federal authorization through the TANF block grant includes use of the TANF funds to meet non- recurrent, short-term benefits to address specific crisis situations, including domestic violence. (See 45CFR 260.31 (b)) Co-located Domestic Violence Advocates P rogram This program is enabled by HB 5030- A of the 2011 Oregon Legislative Assembly Joint Committee on Ways and Means. Th e bill includes funding for contracted domestic violence specialists in ODHS office. Survivor Investment Partnership (SIP) SIP is ena bled by SB 5529 of the 2021 Oregon Legislative Assembly Joint Committee on Ways and Means. Th e bill includes funding to contract with Confederated Tribes in Oregon and culturally specific DVSA organizations to provide DVSA services to survivors. This flexi ble funding can be used to address safety needs not able to be supported through TA- DVS. Th e bill also funds three positions within ODHS to implement the SIP program. Program Description: Employment and Training Programs Program Contact: John Briscoe SSP Employment and Training Programs include the TANF Job Opportunity and Basic Skills (JOBS) program, SNAP Training and Employment Program (STEP) and the Able -Bodied Adults Without Dependents (ABAWD) program. Each of these offers a variety of employment and training services to TANF and SNAP 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |12 Oregon Department of Hum an Services Self -Sufficiency Program s Program Unit Form participants, including stabilization, well- being, training and education, job preparation and employment placement services. JOBS Basic and JOBS Separate State Program Services The JOBS Program is funde d through a combination of TANF Federal Funding and State General Fund. Due to restrictions of TANF Federal Funding, services to some participants are provided fully through State General Fund. JOBS services are offered by contracted local service provider s. Participants are eligible for payments from ODHS to help families stabilize and engage in a personal development plan. SNAP Employment & Training The SNAP Employment and Training Programs - STEP and ABAWD - are funded by a combination of SNAP Federal Fu nding, State General Fund and local investment which pulls down additional federal funds. State General Fund investment allows for expanded support service payments. SNAP Employment and Training services are offered by contracted local service providers. P articipants are eligible for payments to help engage in their personal employment plan. Program Justification Creating the Future of Human Services Employment and training services utilize a family engagement model. Using a person-centered, trauma -informe d model encourages empowerment and ownership of a person's plan to achieve personal stabilization and self -sufficiency. Oregon's Employment and Training Programs are recognized nationally and have been used as models for setting future program redesign federally. ODHS Equity North Star Employment and training services provide streamlined access to people experiencing low income, offering holistic supports to close opportunity gaps. These services make it possible for TANF and SNAP participants to get indivi dualized support needed to build a pathway to economic mobility. Oregon's TANF and SNAP participants represent the state's diversity. Program services are designed to ensure activities are accessible to all, are culturally appropriate, are delivered with service equity and include diverse representation among providers. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |13 Oregon Department of Hum an Services Self -Sufficiency Program s Program Unit Form Community Engagement Employment and Training services have benefitted from community focus groups, with a n emphasis on prioritizing participant voice and identifying gaps between current se rvices and community needs. Employment and Training services have been expanded upon based on the needs expressed in such forums. Employment and Training will continue to evaluate policies and program design based on community voice. Program Performance Employment and Training program performance is measured using the following Self-Sufficiency measures: OP2 - Core resources available OP4 - Participants with active plan steps OP5 - Family/Participant involvement O4 - Living wage jobs Enabling Legislation Temporary Assistance for Needy Families The TANF program is authorized under Title IV- A of the Social Security Act, as amended by the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) and the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. A significant portion of the JOBS program is codified in State statute chapters 411 and 412. SNAP Employment and Training The SNAP Employment and Training program is mandated by Federal legislation currently found in the 2018 Agricultural Improve ment Act signed in 2019. Program Description: Employment Related Day Care Program Contact: Kirstin Holman The Employment Related Day Care (ERDC) program helps families experiencing low income pay for quality child care. Child care helps parents stay employed and gain self -sufficiency by assisting with the consistent child care parents need to remain on the job. Quality child care provides a stable space for children to learn and build upon key developmental milestones while their parents are away at work and prepares them for kindergarten and beyond. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |14 Oregon Department of Hum an Services Self -Sufficiency Program s Program Unit Form HB 3073 from Oregon's 2021 legislative session moves the ERDC program to the newly created Department of Early Learning and Care (DELC). The transfer consolidates state -run child care subsidy programs into one agency, bringing greater program alignment and better access for families. The legislation included expansion and enhancements to the ERDC program. ODHS will be collaborating with the Early Learning Division to move the program and implement significant policy updates by July 1, 2023. ODHS will continue to assess program eligibility through the ONE system. Availability of subsidized child care is a federal requirement for Oregon's Child Care Development Fund (CCDF) federal funding. CCDF funding maintains Oregon's child care licensing system. Program Justification Creating the Future of Human Services ODHS hol ds contracts with various school districts to pay for child care while teen parents are completing their high school diplomas and/or GEDs; program enhancements will bring teen parents into the eligible population within ERDC with the transition to DELC. This will allow all teen parents across the state the same access to quality care while they complete high school or their GED. Future enhancements include interlinking ERDC with TANF JOBS related child care. Families who come to qualify for ERDC after rece iving child care assistance through TANF JOBS support services payments will be able to obtain and maintain employment by securing child care before their job stability is put at risk by interlinking these programs. In ERDC's transition to DELC, eligibili ty criteria will be expanded to allow for students to access child care subsidy without the requirement to be employed. Presently, students of higher education can only qualify for ERDC if they are working and their student hours are limited to the number of their employment hours. This expansion will allow for students of higher education as well as teen parents completing their high school diploma or GED to have provision of child care coverage. Additionally, families will have the opportunity to access c hild care assistance through ERDC when unable to work due to caring for their child's needs, such as a 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |15 Oregon Department of Hum an Services Self -Sufficiency Program s Program Unit Form child's illness. Families will also be able to qualify at initial certification when on leave for medical reasons - for example, maternity leave when ano ther child is in care with a provider. ODHS Equity North Star The ERDC program serves families from a variety of cultural and linguistic backgrounds in urban and rural communities who need assistance covering child care costs through subsidy payments to a chosen child care provider. By building and sustaining connections to child care and early education programs as well as safety net programs, this approach provides broader access and outreach opportunities to connect with Oregonians with a n array of chil d care needs. Policy changes are being made to the ERDC program in its transition to the Department of Early Learning and Care to allow for eligibility to undocumented children. Current policy does not allow for this population to be eligible for child care subsidy despite child care need. Community Engagement Child care subsidy programs engage with child care providers and provider unions with the goal of giving additional stability to Oregon's child care provider base, including both licensed programs a nd facilities as well as license -exempt home - based care, commonly referred to as \"family, friend and neighbor care.\" All provider types can become listed and approved for payment through ODHS/DELC to be paid on behalf of eligible families receiving subsidy. Program Performance ERDC program performance is measured by the e ligible working families receiving ERDC (<6 and 6 to <13) . Enabling Legislation The ERDC program is authorized under the Code of Federal Regulations Title 45 Public Welfare, Subtitle A Department of Health and Human Services, Subchapter A General Administration, Part 98 Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF). The Department of Educati on, Early Learning Division is currently Oregon's lead agency for CCDF and transfers approximately 70% of CCDF funds to ODHS to maintain the child care subsidy program. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |16 Oregon Department of Hum an Services Self -Sufficiency Program s Program Unit Form A significant portion of the ERDC program is codified in State statute chapters 329. Program Description: Food and Nutrition Programs Program Contact: Heather Miles Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) The Oregon Department of Human Services (ODHS) administers the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) which provides a food benefit and additional services to Oregonians that meet financial and non-financial eligibility criteria. Program benefits are 100% F ederal Funds and program administration is 50% F ederal and 50% G eneral Fund. Most of the administration funding is allocated towards Eligibility Workers to ensure benefit eligibility and issuance is responsive and timely. SNAP EBT SNAP benefits are issued monthly onto an Electronic Benefit Transfer card (EBT) for households to use to purchase eligible foods a t USDA Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) approved retailers/vendors and farmer's markets. Oregon SNAP uses the vendor FIS Solutions to support timely delivery of electronic benefits onto Oregon EBT cards through ONE system interfaces. SNAP Cash Out To qu alify for SNAP Cash Out, all individuals in the household must be considered disabled or aged 65 and older and residing in Clackamas, Columbia, Multnomah and Washington counties. Qualifying households receive their monthly allotment as cash on their EBT card or through direct deposit. This is a federally approved program option that cannot be expanded beyond the se four Oregon counties but is 100% funded for benefit issuance. SNAP Nutrition Education Oregon's SNAP Nutrition Education (SNAP -Ed) program is administered through a partnership with Oregon State University Extension Services (OSU -EXT). SNAP -Ed is an evidence -based federal grant-funded program 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |17 Oregon Department of Hum an Services Self -Sufficiency Program s Program Unit Form that helps people lead healthy, active lives by working alongside people to identify ways to make their SNAP dollars stretch, how to shop for and cook healthy mea ls and how to stay physically active. SNAP Outreach SNAP Outreach passes through federal funding to 13 contracted community agencies statewide to support activities that distribute information about SNAP, dispel myths and offer application assistance to individuals. Contracted community partners may request up to 50% federal reimbursement for costs related to SNAP Outreach allowable activities which expands the reach of the SNAP and reduces barriers to accessing the program. Food Assistance The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) and Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) are federal food assistance programs wherein ODHS partners with the Oregon Food Bank network to administer food assistanc e across the state through local food pantries and food boxes. Program Justification Strengthening our Foundations Oregon SNAP continues to focus on increasing awareness and participation for the program to ensure that access and availability of service s are provided in a timely and accurate manner. Where possible, TEFAP and CSFP program funding is used to purchase and distribute more locally grown, fresh, nutrient dense and culturally specific foods throughout Oregon. Leveraging federal food dollars thr ough program funding means that any General Fund allocations can stretch the program reach beyond the federal investment and is not duplicative of federal food orders. TEFAP and CSFP programming help support Oregon's larger food infrastructure and reaches program recipients beyond other food programming like SNAP. Responding to Emergencies SNAP provides food assistance through disaster and COVID -19 pandemic -related food programs such as Emergency Allotment (EA) benefits, Disaster SNAP (DSNAP) and Pandemic EBT (PEBT). TEFAP can provide the Disaster Household 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |18 Oregon Department of Hum an Services Self -Sufficiency Program s Program Unit Form Distribution (DHD) program in the event of a state disaster. This program can temporarily increase food resources in affected communities through food pantries prior to the activation of Disaster SNAP. Creating the Future of Human Services SNAP benefits help to reduce hunger as part of Oregon's larger food network and are an integral part of strengthening an individual/household's ability to navigate temporary or larger scale crisis. The SNAP -Ed State Plan is 100% federally funded block gran t that is used to provide evidence -based services to increase SNAP participants awareness of stretching food dollars, increasing awareness of healthy options, increasing knowledge and understanding that supports increased physical activity and to work with community partners to build healthier and stronger community foundations. ODHS Equity North Star In 2021, 1 in 6 Oregonians on average received SNAP benefits across all age ranges, race and ethnicity and disabilities. The program continues to pursue waivers and state options that increase the program 's reach to under served populations. SNAP EBT and SNAP Cash Out increase access and improve connections for all SNAP participants, ensuring that flexibility and usage of the program is supported through benefi t delivery systems. Culturally specific workgroups have been implemented for SNAP -Ed to address needs for under -represented communities including older adults, Tribal partners, Pacific Islander, Latinx and African Heritage communities. TEFAP and CSFP ensure that additional food resources are available throughout the state's 20 regional food banks and 1,400 food pantries in the food bank network. Program Performance SNAP The program is measured through state and federal standards for timely issuance of benefits (new and recertifications) , accuracy of benefit calculations and ease of accessibility and connection to services. Evaluation is assessed in and Means Page |19 Oregon Department of Hum an Services Self -Sufficiency Program s Program Unit Form SNAP EBT The program is measured through state and federal standards for timely issuance of benefits (new and recertifications) , accuracy of benefit calculations and ease of accessibility and connection to services.

SNAP Cash Out The program is measured through state and federal standards for timely issuance of benefits (new and recertifications) , accuracy of benefit calculations and ease of accessibility and connection to services. Evaluation is assessed in Self-Sufficiency measures OP3, SP1, SP2, O7 and O8. SNAP -Ed SNAP -Ed performance is measured through state and federal standards that are part of an evidence -based national framework. These measures are not currently part of the ODHS measures but there are connecting elements that can demonstrate links. SNAP Outrea ch SNAP Outreach activities are incorporated into the agencies broader service array which better connects individuals to supports the family in reaching goals. Evaluation is assessed in Self-Sufficiency measures OP3, and CSFP performance is evaluated throughout the year in a combination of program funding evaluation and onsite evaluation for quality control of food storage and oversight per federal regulations. Evaluation is assessed partly in Self- Sufficienc y measure SP3. Enabling Legislation SNAP is guided by federal legislation found in the \"Farm Bill \" authorized by The Agricultural Act of 2014 (P.L. 113- 79, Feb 7, 2014). Program policy is reauthorized every five years through the Farm Bill. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |20 Oregon Department of Hum an Services Self -Sufficiency Program s Program Unit Form Program Description: Family Support and Connections Program Contact: Xochitl Esparza Family Support and Connections (FS&C) is a child abuse and neglect primary and secondary prevention program that provides a wide array of contracted services to TANF eligible families including home visits, resource brokering and parenting classes. In 2022, the Oregon Legislature approved an expansion to include families receiving SNAP benefit s. FS&C is intended for eligible families who may be at risk for involvement with the child welfare system. Program Justification Strengthening our Foundations FS&C focuses on building safer, healthier communities by promoting its goal of increasing protec tive factors and promoting child and family health and well -being. By achieving this goal , the program supports the community in reduc ing or prevent ing children from families experiencing low income from entering the child welfare system. Research consis tently demonstrates children and young people have better outcomes when they remain safely in their homes while receiving services and allowing them to maintain ties with their family, friends, schools and communities. 2 By supporting family preservation a nd prevention, FS&C is a critical part of Oregon's service continuum, supporting existing agency and state efforts such as the 2020- 2024 Healthier Together Oregon plan and the CW Vision for Transformation. ODHS Equity North Star Recent research suggests investments in prevention go beyond protecting children from maltreatment to preventing maltreatment 's devastating consequences.3 It is recognized that racial disparities in child welfare impact Black, Indigenous and families with lower socioeconomic status disproportionately. To better implement cultural responsiveness in service delivery and increase outreach and access to FS&C services prioritizing Black, Indigenous, People of Color and rural communities, designated funding is allocated for FS& C providers 2 Child Welfare Information G ateway.

Furthermore, with the funding increase approved in 2022, FS&C is pursuing expanded access and outreach for these populations offering the funding opportunity to culturally specific organizations and Oregon Tribal Nations. Community Engagement FS&C program staff work within the existing community structure to coordinate referrals and deliver direct services where gaps or needs exist for a family. This includes collaboration with Self Sufficiency (SSP) and Child Welfare (CW) program staff and contracted and other community partners. FS&C contracted providers organize local core teams to coordinate program delivery and services. Each district's program is guided by local steering committees comprised of representatives from SSP, Child Welfar e and public and private partners that may include local service providers, consumer parents, advocates, faith- based representatives, persons with disabilities and members of the public. Steering committees must include cultural diversity in the district t hey serve. Steering committees provide advice, guidance and support for the FS&C Core Team concerning program requirements such as, planning and implementation, overcoming barriers to services, community relations and advocacy, process improvement and goal setting. Program Performance The primary performance measure for FS&C is the percentage of children entering foster care who received TANF and or SNAP 60 days prior to foster care entry. Because the families FS&C serves are connected to TANF and/or SNAP, they may be included in SSP's Key Performance Measures: living wage jobs, housing stability, food security, self -efficacy/hope. Enabling Legislation Title II of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), as amended by P.L. 111 -320, authorizes g rant funds to be released to the states and names the program Community -Based Grants for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect (CBCAP). The grant requires a 20 percent match of State General Fund dollars. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |22 Oregon Department of Hum an Services Self -Sufficiency Program s Program Unit Form The TANF program is authorized under Title IV- A of the Social Security Act, as amended by the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) and the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. Youth Experiencing Homelessness Program Program Contact: Xochitl Esparza The Youth Experiencing Homelessness Program (YEHP) provides services and supports to unaccompanied youth and young adults under the age of 24 without shelter who are not able to safely reside with a parent or guardian. The program administers funding to local nonprofit providers across the state providing shelter services, drop- in and outreach services, job development and mentoring services and housing supports such as host homes and transitional living programming. ODHS partners with a cross- system advisory group t o coordinate statewide policy and planning to address the needs of youth experiencing homelessness. Program Justification Creating the Future of Human Services YEHP is testing new ways to address youth homelessness such as deploying Direct Cash Transfers to young people and providing the necessary supports so that they can safely meet their housing needs. Additionally, the program is creating the structure necessary to create a Youth Advisory Board so that young people routinely inform program de sign for YEHP and sister agencies serving youth. ODHS Equity North Star National estimates provide that approximately one in 30 youth (aged 13- 17) and one in 10 young adults (aged 18 -25) experience homelessness over the course of a year.4 Black, Indigenous, youth of color and LGBTQ2S+ youth experience higher rates of homelessness. Community Engagement ODHS convenes a Youth Experiencing Homelessness Advisory Committee involving the Youth Development Division, the Housing and Community Services Department, the Department of Education, the Oregon Youth Authority among other agencies and nonprofit organizations to develop a comprehensive and 4 Dworsky, A., Gitlow, E., Horwitz, B., & Samuels, G. M. (2019). Missed opportunities: Pathways from foster care to youth homelessness in America.

In 2021, ODHS in c ollaboration with the Corporation for Supportive Housing (CSH) released the results of a statewide analysis that examined the need and pipeline for housing and services for youth experiencing or at risk of experiencing homelessness.5 Unique in the study w as a comprehensive effort to recruit and engage youth across the state with lived experience of homelessness to inform and design housing and services programs that may receive state funding. The project was born from the 2020 session of the Oregon Legisla ture after a proposed bill requested a study to better understand the level of investment required to address statewide housing and service gaps for young people. Program Performance YEHP measures are included in contracts with youth -serving community- based organizations. Several contracts include measures related to permanent connections for youth, education, well- being and housing stability. Enabling Legislation/Program Authorization Oregon State Statute 417.799 gives ODHS responsibility for coordinating statewide planning for delivery of services to youth experiencing homelessness. My Future -My Choice Program Contact: Bill Baney Program Description The My Future -My Choice (MFMC) program includes age appropriate, medically accurate sexual health education curriculum and services for middle school students and a high school leadership and mentor component. MFMC's goals are to promote sexual risk avoidance as the healthiest choice for young people , increase knowledge of sexual health and promote the benefits of delaying sexual activity using a positive youth development framework. MFMC seeks to support higher risk youth populations who experience elevated rates of sexually transmitted illnesses (S TIs), unplanned pregnancy and sexual violence in their communities. These services support community prevention 5 https://www.oregon.gov/dhs/CHILDREN/Homeless -Youth/Documents/CSH -YH-Needs.pdf 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |24 Oregon Department of Hum an Services Self -Sufficiency Program s Program Unit Form efforts to enable TANF families in breaking the generational dependence on public assistance. MFMC expands on the historical teen pregnancy prev ention program to provide education and tools for youth to resist multiple risk- taking behaviors. ODHS partners with the Oregon Department of Education and the MFMC Advisory Committee to develop and implement the program. Program Justification Strengtheni ng our Foundations Oregon teen pregnancy rates have consistently stayed below the national average. According to national data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the 2019 national rate for births to teens between the ages of 15 to 19 is 16.7 per 1,000 teens. In Oregon, the teen pregnancy rate among youth 15 to 19 years continues to decline, from 38.6 per 1,000 in 2010 to 18.1 per 1,000 in 2019. Similarly, the teen birth rate among youth 15 to 19 years declined from 28.45 per 1,000 in 2 010 to 9.6 per 1,000 in 2020. MFMC works closely with system/sector partners at the state and local level to ensure aligned, coordinated and deliberate access to resources and materials to increase youth sexual health education and services. Community Enga gement MFMC utilizes a peer mentor/training model. High s chool students lead or co- lead 5 of the 10 program modules. In addition, the program uses a Teen Advisory Board (TAB) to help inform curriculum revision, material development and delivery format. TAB members are provided with compensation (stipends) for the time and expertise offered. Program Performance No specific or unique QTR measures have been identified for MFMC because objectives associated with the program are tailored to meet the needs of a comprehensive sexual health program. As a program to reduce teen pregnancy, MFMC is designed as a primary pr evention program. Enabling Legislation The Oregon Legislature passed HB 2509 in 2009, which requires that all schools provide comprehensive sexual health education. The My Future -My Choice curriculum complies with all requirements of this legislation for sixth grade. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |25 Oregon Department of Hum an Services Self -Sufficiency Program s Program Unit Form ODHS partners with Oregon Health Authority and Oregon Department of Education to share in responsibility for collaborative efforts to increase youth sexual health education and services. Other Family Support Program Contact: James Barta, Xochitl Esparza Program Description The Tax -Filing Infrastructure Grant Program is a funding opportunity for culturally specific and responsive organizations, Tribal governments and under -resourced rural community service organizations. The goal of the progra m is to improve access for low -income Oregonians to the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and other tax benefits. Grant funding allows community -based organizations to offer tax navigation, preparation and filing services. Through the utilization of existing tax benefits, Oregon residents have the opportunity to bring more than $100 million in federal dollars to the state's economy every year. These grants will : Stren gthen the existing network of culturally specific and responsive tax preparation organizations; Bring tax navigation and preparation services to geographically diverse areas of Oregon ; Improve organizational capacity of tax preparation organizations; Expan d the recruitment and retention of qualified tax preparers ; and Fund the development of technological resources, training systems, outreach and education materials to ensure the removal of tax-filing barriers. This program will seat an advisory council representing different populations throughout Oregon to support the process and implementation of the grant program. Program Justification Removing Barriers to Economic Stability Oregon has a historically low participation rate in EITC. It has been the s econd -to- last state in the use of the credit among eligible families, despite EITC 's proven 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |26 Oregon Department of Hum an Services Self -Sufficiency Program s Program Unit Form ability to boost the income of low -wage earning families.6 The benefits of EITC are well -documented and between 2011- 2013, federal EITC, along with the federal Child Tax Credit (CTC), helped to lift 129,000 Oregonians out of povert y.7 Appropriate tax preparation and navigation assistance should be provided to help eligible Oregonians overcome barriers preventing access to these benefits. This grant program promises to strengthen and grow Oregon's network of free taxpayer services and ensure that these organizations are culturally diverse and meet the needs of residents. State funding will allow more organiz ations flexibility in securing needed funds and build the capacity to offer free tax services and support. ODHS Equity North Star , Community Engagement This program is directed to populations who, due to systemic discrimination, are underutilizing valuable cash assistance. By working with community- based organizations who serve the affected communities, Oregon will more effectively reach all Oregonians regardless of their identity or place. This program will reach all parts of the state and all populations, particularly those underserved by existing tax-filing infrastructure. Expanding access to tax services in Oregon can advance long-term, equitable, antiracist policies that can upend existing inequalities. Program Performance Program performance measures are to be determined. It will take an estimated three years to receive the data to determine the rate of eligible Oregonians signing up for credits such as EITC. A likely short- term measure will be community partner reports detailing the number of Oregonians filing their taxes. Enabling Legislation/Program Authorization The Oregon Legislature passed HB 4117 in February 2022, which gives ODHS responsibility for coordinating statewide planning for the delivery of services. The Tax-Filing Infrastructure Grant Program complies with the requirements of this legislation.

ODHS Child Welfare will achieve this Vision for Transforma tion through: Assess ing child safety and provid ing in-home support s to prevent placements away from parents, family, friends and community ; Expand ing services to prevent foster care placements and ensure that intensive interventions are as effective as possible ; Ensur ing foster care is family and community- based, time -limited, culturally responsive and designed to stabilize families rather than serving primarily as a placement for children ; Establishing that children and young adults will be in the care of family, friends and neighbors whenever possible, and help ing children keep connections to their cultures, Tribal Nations and communities ; Recogniz ing the necessity of short- term, individually customize d treatment programs for children w ho have higher -level physical, developmental, and mental health needs . These supports should occur while children or youth are living in families with birth or adoptive parents, relatives, close friends or foster caregivers (resource families) ; Collaborat ing and building strong relationships with Tribes , comm unities, people with lived expertise and systems partners ; Striving for a well -supported workforce that has development opportunities and access to the resource s and services needed to support our children, families and communities ; and Dismantl ing structural and systemic racism and moving toward a more equitable and fair system of support for all families. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|2 Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare Program Narrative The Child Welfare Division's mission is to ensure every child and family is empowered to live a safe, stable, and healthy life. This mission is based on a set of beliefs and core values: We believe children , youth and young adults do best growing up in a family. We believe our child welfare agency and its partners can better ensure people's safety, health and well-being if they work in constant collaboration and proactively engage individuals, families and co mmunities. We believe when families and communities are strong, fewer children experience abuse and neglect. We believe earlier, less intrusive support for families means more children can remain safe and healthy at home and in school, where they can mai ntain the bonds and connections that are critical to their well-being, leading to better long-term outcomes for children and young adults . We believe families and communities working together in a more proactive, holistic way will also help free up budget and staff resources. This allows ODHS and its partners to allocate resources in ways that have the greatest impact for children and young adults. Integrating services will mean less need for costly foster care, residential placements, and other crisis support, creating opportunities for more innovation, creative solutions, and new business models. About the Child Welfare Division The Child Welfare Division serve s children and families who are facing challenges that can affect child safety and responds when children are subject to abuse and neglect. Skilled and diverse C hild Welfare staff respond to reports of child abuse and neglect, helping to assess whether supports or services can be provided to the family to prevent the need for out -of-home care and coordinating foster care placement in cases where a child cannot be maintained safely at home. The primary goal is to keep children safe while providing equitable services to support timely and safe return to their families in cases where an out- of-home placement is necessary . The Child Welfare Division 's work encompasse s the following areas : 1. Child Abuse Hotline 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|3 Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare Program Narrative 2. Child Safety Program 3. Child Fatality Review and Prevention Program 4. Family Preservation 5. Child and F amily Well -being Programs 6. Permanency Program 7. Program Design & Delivery 8. Federal Policy, Planning & Resources , and Child Welfare Policy 9. Other Central Office Programs and Focus Areas In Oregon during Federal Fiscal Year (FFY) 202 1: 8,620 children spent at least one day in foster care 162,185 total contacts (calls and cross -reported police reports) answered by The Oregon Child Abuse Hotline (ORCAH) 78,775 reports of abuse and neglect were received 42,876 reports were referred for investigation 7,352 reports were founded for abuse or neglect involving 10,766 victims 41.5 percent of the victi ms were younger than 6 years old Of the total children served in foster care, 65.4 percent were White, 18.6 percent were Hispanic, 7.1 percent were Black or African American, 4.7 percent were American Indian or Alaska Native, 2.7 percent did not have race recorded and 1.5 percent were Asian or Pacific Islander. Child Abuse Hotline The Oregon Child Abuse Hotline (ORCAH) is crucial to the Child Welfare system in Oregon. The program is responsible for receiving calls from mandated reporters and community regarding child safety and determine if reports are screened -in for investigation. Child Safety Program The Child Safe ty program responds to reports of child maltreatment to determine if a child has experienced abuse or neglect or is safe. . Response is sometimes done in partnership with local law enforcement and Oregon Tribal Nations. The program also 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|4 Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare Program Narrative assesses whether there is a risk of future maltreatment while offering locally based services for intervention. The Child Safety program also provides coordination for the following areas: Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children (CSEC) The CSEC coordination pr ovides culturally and linguistically responsive multi - disciplinary services by connecting Child Welfare staff to key partners in order to help youth who are being sexually exploited to access safe shelter and wrap - around services supporting their physical and emotional needs. These partners include : National Center for Missing & Exploited Children Law Enforcement Agencies (LEA) Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Other community agencies Addiction Recovery Teams (ART Teams) These teams provide coordinated, culturally, and linguistically responsive , multi -disciplinary services to family members who struggle with substance use and/or substance use disorder a. Issues around substance abuse are identified through a comprehensive safety assessment. Domestic Violence/Sexual Assault ODHS makes grants available to domestic violence and sexual assault service providers throughout Oregon. These providers offer culturally and linguistically responsive crisis lines, crisis response, emergency shelter and other related services to survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence and their children. Child Fatality Prevention and Review Program This program was created to improve child safety and prevent child maltreatment fatalities in Oregon. The goals of this program align with the Family First requirement to creat e a state fatality prevention plan. It also provide s a unique and necessary opportunity to promote a system shift toward prevention polic ies and practices t hat address risk to Oregon's most vulnerable children. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|5 Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare Program Narrative The Child Fatality Prevention and Review program coordinates the Critical Incident Review Team (CIRT), which is an approach Oregon's Child Welfare system has used for many years to respond to critical incidents that result in child fatalities. With several significant changes to the CIRT statute in 2019, there was a need to increase program capacity to comply with the law and respond to the extensive increase in the number of assigned CIRTs . The development of this program has created opportunit ies for Oregon's Child Welfare system to better understand, learn from and prevent these tragedies. The work of t he CIRT is intended to advance quality improvement in Oregon's Child Welfare system. M oving CIRT coordination out of the Child Safety Program and into Child Fatality Prevention and Review has increase d the independence and transparency of child safety and fatality reviews. Th e program will continue to work a cross systems and with community partners such as public health and other child- and family -serving agencies in Oregon to improve child safety outcomes and prevent child maltreatment fatalities in our communities. Family Preservation Child Welfare is actively building the new Family Preservation Program with 2021 - 23 state investments in the program's initial infrastructure . Designed to strengthen families and prevent children's entry into foster care whenever safely possible , the program is a key step in Oregon's implementation of the federal Family First Prevention Services Act. The system strives to spare children and families from the trauma of separation by addressing family stressors and establishing supports that maximize families' potential to meet their children's needs. Currently, when Child Welfare safety assessment indicates that a child is unsafe and the family needs supports and/or services to resolve th is, the agency works with the family and team to determine whether the child's placement with their parent or guardian can be safely maintained. When it is determined that a family can remain intact given the right supports, Child Welfare partners with the family and team to plan and deliver service s, create a safety plan and conduct ongoing monitoring . The vision for this program is to be able to provide services and supports to families and children more broadly than an assessment indicating lack of safety. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|6 Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare Program Narrative Child and Family Well-being Programs Child and family well -being programs include Foster Care, Youth Transition Services and Health and W ellness Services. Foster Care Oregon's Foster Care program values foster care services as a support to families , not a substitute for parents and families . In order to support the families it serves, the program engages parents, youth, kin, community partners, legal professionals, Tribal partners, resource families and others as a way to holistically support family safety and stabilization. Foster Care services include Relative Care, Family Foster Care and professional levels of care - such as Shelter Care and Behavioral Rehabilitation Services, which are provided in therapeutic home or residential settings through contracted Child Caring Agencies (CCAs). The foster care system operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week , to accept and care for children who cannot remain safely at home. Oregon's goal aligns with the federal requirement of placing a child in the least restrictive, most appropriate setting that meets the child's individual needs when the child cannot safely be cared for by parent(s). This program focuses on the well -being of children and young adults while they are in foster care and is responsible for recruitment of resource (foster) families that reflect the characteristics of children i n foster care. This program certif ies, trains, and retains resource families (both general applicants and kith/kin caregivers). Resource families are trained by agency staff and through contracted experts. Resource families participate in a Structured Anal ysis Family Evaluation (SAFE) home study, designed to evaluate a family's suitability and readiness to meet the needs of children and young adults that enter the child welfare system. Resource families must also pass: A criminal background check , Reference checks , and A review of Oregon's abuse registry, which includes all prior abuse reports received on children and adults 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|7 Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare Program Narrative The program also recruit s, contract s, train s, supports, and monitor s all contracted CCAs . ODHS partners with community members, Oregon Tribal Nations, local and national foster care organizations, provider organizations, youth- led organizations and organizations representing diverse cultural perspectives to deliver services throughout the state. ODHS also works in collaboration with multiple state , Tribal and local government agencies - including Oregon Healthy Authority, Oregon Department of Education, local law enforcement and Oregon Tribal Nations - as well as community programs, schools, the faith community and volunteer programs to identify and develop a local array of equitable, cultural ly and linguistically responsive services. The program supports the overall well -being of children in foster care by : Addressing behavioral, emotional, and social functioning Meeting core educational needs Ensuring appropriate physical, dental and mental health care Maintaining safe family and community connections Youth Transition Services The Child Welfare Youth Transition programs, including the Independent Living Program (ILP), serves current and former foster children and young adults up to age 21. Services include assistance with developing life skills and learning about: Financial literacy Communication and social skills Relationship building skills Resources available in local communities Informed decision -making Parenting Health Education support Housing 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|8 Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare Program Narrative Transportation options Job readines s The program helps young people develop plans to complete high school and successful ly transition to post -secondary education or employment. Housing support options are available to eligible youth through transitional living programs, the independent living housing subsidy program and the federal Chafee housing program. Health and Wellness Services ODHS p laces high priority on ensuring that children in out- of-home care receive appropriate medical, dental and mental health care. In addition to the appointments and screenings that are required when a child enters foster care, children are assessed by a contracted nurse shortly after entering care to address any immediate health needs. Support is provided to the child and resource parents for any health-related or medication issues the child may have. Contracted nurses provide : Medication management services Case consultation Medical care coordination Nursing delegation Resource parent teaching and training Other nursing services as needed The Health and Wellness team provides resources, support and case consultation to staff and provides resources for resource parents who care for medically fragile children. A nnual psychotropic medication reviews and psychotropic medication authorizations are completed by a Nurse Consultant for all children in care who are currently prescribed psychotropic medications. Medical Assistance Resource Coordinators (MARCs) assist with access to care issues and help coordinate services with Coordinated Care Organizations (CCO s) throughout the state to ensure children's health, mental health and dental needs are being met. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|9 Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare Program Narrative Permanency Program Child Welfare prioritizes the safe and successful reunif ication of children with their parent(s ). Specially trained staff partner with parents to develop and meet goals for change so that children can remain safely at home or return home after placement in substitute care. Permanency staff work together with families, children, community partners and the legal system to create and support case plans with the goal of reunification. Once children are placed with a permanent adoptive or guardian family, the Permanency program continues to provide services and supports to children up to age 18 to help meet the special needs and challenges of those who have experienced abuse and neglect. These ef forts include consider ation of the child's specific cultural , developmental, and linguistic needs. ODHS is also responsible for the coordinating the Voluntary Adoption Search and Registry Program for Oregon's public and private adoptions. This registry may include adoptions for children with relatives living in other countries pursuant to The Hague Convention and the Intercountry Adoption Act. Strengthening, Preserving and Reunifying Families (SPRF) The Strengthening Preserving and Reunifying Families law (ORS 418.575- 418.598) allows funding for an array of services to families through collaboration between ODHS and local community partners. ODHS has developed outcome -based contracts for services to specifically address the needs of children and families who come to the attention of child welfare through a screened in report of abuse or neglect. These outcome -based contracts also enable accurate report ing on results associated with SPRF services and f unding. In-Home Safety and Reunification Services (ISRS) This program provides culturally responsive , intensive, short- term services to families with children who can remain safely in their homes, and to children and families who have been safely reunite d. ISRS provides a combination of safety and strengths- based services that lead to lasting safety changes within 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|10 Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare Program Narrative the family. These services are time -limited and are complemented by SPRF services for families in need of longer term or more intensive service s. System of Care (SOC) System of Care funds support Oregon's most vulnerable children by providing local Child Welfare offices with the flexibility to purchase services to meet a family's specific needs and ensure the safety, permanency, and well -being of their child(ren) in culturally and linguistically responsive ways. Families are directly involved in case planni ng and the identifi cation of needed services. Whenever possible, community partners share funding of custom -designed services. Program Design & Delivery Oregon has a state -administered child welfare program. The Child Welfare Executive Leadership team , in collaboration with the Child Welfare design program managers and staff , provide leadership, guidance and central office support to program and delivery staff through : Collaborating with community partners and Tribal Nations Developing policy and rule Complying with federal and state regulations Monitoring quality assurance and continuous quality improvement Managing projects and providing technical assistance Evaluating and analyzing the program Designing training and workforce resources for staff and resource families Ensuring the integrity of business processes and standards Identifying and implementing equity -building, evidence -based and best practices frameworks Managers and supervisors in local Child Welfare offices provide clinical and case - level supervision of direct service staff across the program areas . Whenever possible, Child Welfare staff coordinate with ODHS Self-Sufficiency Programs staff to support family stability and prevent entry/re -entry into the child welfare system. Child Welfare staff coordinate with other child- and family -serving systems including housing-focused organizations , Oregon Health Authority, Oregon Department of 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|11 Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare Program Narrative Education, county -based health and support services and others. Child Welfare employees provide direct services to children and families in local offices. Figure 1: Child Welfare d istrict map 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|12 Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare Program Narrative Federal Policy, Planning & Resources (FPPR) FPPR is responsible for ensuring that Child Welfare remains in compliance with federal program standards, maximiz ing continued federal financial support for the Child Welfare programs and services described above. FPPR submits all required federal reporting an d respond s to related inquiries. The primary goal of FPPR is to optimize the use of federal funds while ensuring that all funds are used solely for allowable purposes. These include: Title IV-B - Subpart s 1 & 2 Title IV-D - Child Support Title IV-E - Foster Care, Adoption Assistance and Guardianship Assistance, Family First Prevention Services Title XIX - Medicaid Title XX - Social Services Block Grant TANF EA - Emergency Assistance Child Welfare Policy Child Welfare Policy is responsible for ensuring that policy, procedure, and rules are updated in accordance with statute s and requirements. The team provides leadership to the PARRC ensuring that any new rules and any policy changes have the opportunity f or public comment.

Other Central Office Programs and Focus Areas Equity, Training and Workforce Development and Resource Family Training Child Welfare staff and leaders are supported by the central office Equity, Training and Workforce Development team, which consists of service delivery leaders and contracted providers who collectively ensure that we have a diverse, skilled and engaged workforce that reflects and embraces the communities we serve . 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|13 Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare Program Narrative The workforce development framework is grounded in a clear research- informed and data -driven system s of best -practices related to: Recruit ing, screen ing, select ion and onboarding quality recruits ; Providing p re-service and ongoing training and development for staff and resource families that develop baseline and developmental knowledge, skills and abilities; A transfer -of-learning, coaching, supervisory and consultation framework s that work to continuously increase the competence and confidence of staff at all levels ; Developing l eadership with promotional readiness and succession planning to retain high -performing and adaptive leaders for the future ; Using c ontinuous quality improvement processes that are informed by a robust workforce development evaluation plan; and Evolving technology to inc rease access to learning, attend to diverse adult learning needs and track and report on the developmental learning of all staff and resource families. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Child Welfare is working to improve equity and inclusion in all aspec ts of our program and to provide inclusive, equitable and culturally responsive and appropriate services to children, young adults and families. Additionally, Child Welfare is working with communit ies, Tribal Nations and other child welfare partners to: Center equity in all aspects of the work; Creat e more transparent and meaningful partnerships ; Share quality data and outcomes; Include the voice s of community, and of people with lived experience in child welfare systems, in our planning and in decision- making ; and Creat e a shared vision for how meaningful partnership will promote improved child and family outcomes. Child Welfare is constantly looking for ways to assess how policies, rules, organizational culture and practice s are contributing to inequitable outcomes. Among the division's priorities are: 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|14 Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare Program Narrative Better honoring the sovereignty of Oregon Tribal Nations ; Re-envisioning and increas ing the use of culturally relevant services and support s; and Increasing the inclusion of and sharing power with those most impacted by child welfare systems and reviewing all policy, rules and procedures for evidence of unintended contributors to inequitable outcomes. Oregon Indian Child Welfare Act/ Indian Child Welfare Act (ORICWA/ ICWA) In collaboration with the O DHS Tribal Affairs Unit and central office leaders, Child Welfare continuously partners with Tribes, T ribal partners and Native American children and families to improve compliance with and integrat ion of the spirit of ICWA and ORICWA in all our work. Native American children are currently over -represented in Oregon's child welfare system. Compliance with the Indian Child Welfare Act is a federal mandate and Oregon's state ICWA, which passed in the summer of 2020 , further spells out Child Welfare's responsibility to protect and honor Tribal sovereignty, culture, and traditions . ODHS currently has ICWA Consultants , Active Efforts Specialists and identified ICWA liaisons who work to: Improv ing ICWA /ORICWA compliance, Enhanc ing Tribal relationships, Provid ing technical assistance and expert consultation, and Support ing Child Welfare staff in improv ing outcomes for Tribal children and families , and Reduc ing disproportionality and disparities. Family First and System Integration The Federal Family First Prevention Services Act was passed by Congress in February 2018. It changed how Title IV- E funding can be used for prevention and preservation and the type of placements in foster care. The Family First Prevention Plan is an important tool for implementing ODHS Child Welfare's Vision for Transformation goals, helping to strengthen families so that more children can remain safely wit h their parents and kinship caregivers. Family First presents an unprecedented opportunity to give child welfare systems the tools they need to make transformative changes. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|15 Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare Program Narrative Family First supports in- home services that utilize evidence -based practices approved by the Federal Clearinghouse in the following categories: Mental health prevention and treatment programs or services Substance abuse prevention and treatment programs or services In-home parent skill -based programs or services, and Kinship navigator programs Oregon is using a phased -in approach toward implementation with ongoing, structured opportunities for partner feedback and adjustment. Lessons learned from other states and jurisdictions underscore the importance of progressively scalin g up an evidence -based service array, with ample occasion for communication and collaboration between program developers, field staff, service providers, community partners, Tribes, families and youth with lived experience , and others. This team is leading the implementation with the newly created Family Preservation team and working across divisions with ODHS as well as with community partners and organizations to focus on the prevention of Child Welfare invol vement. Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC) The ICPC is the statute that governs the movement of children across state lines. All 50 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands are members of the ICPC. The ICPC covers : Children in Oregon foster care being placed in other states, Children in the custody of an other state 's public child welfare agencies being placed in Oregon, and Private adoption and residential treatment placements that cross state lines. According to the Association of Administrators of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (AAICPC) the ICPC applies to approximately 5 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|16 Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare Program Narrative percent of all child welfare cases nationwide. The Oregon ICPC program includes a team of central office staff who provide tra ining and case consultation to Child Welfare local office staff, attorneys and members of the public. The program also includes a team of regionally based workers who complete home studies with Oregon families seeking to care for children from other states.

Services are delivered through Child Welfare staff or contracts that require lingu istically and culturally appropriate service provision. Services are designed to keep children safely with their parents, whenever possible, and to reunite children quickly and safely with their parents when they have been removed. Program Description The Oregon Department of Human Services (ODHS) Child Welfare Child Safety Program currently consists of one Child Safety Program Manager , two Assistant Manager s, 6 Child Protective Services Program Coordinators (rule writing, implementation, training, and curriculum development, etc .) and 14 Child Safety Consultants who provide consultation, coaching, training , and support to caseworke rs, supervisors, Program and District managers on the safety model practice , Oregon Adm inistrative Rules and statutes. The Child Safety Consultants are located in the local child welfare delivery offices around the state and provide consultation and support to all 16 districts in Oregon. Child Welfare' s Alcohol and Drug Services Coordinator and Domestic & Sexual Violence Fund Coordinator are also located within the Child Safety Program. Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault (DVSA) shelter and service programs are funded by the O DHS to help people in Oregon be safe, healthy, and independent. In addition, the program has 1 Child Protective Services Supervisor and 7 SSS1 caseworkers who function as a mobile CPS team. The Child Safety Program is responsible for administering Child Pro tective Services in the state, including but not limited to the following: Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children , which provides statewide consultation and technical assistance on child welfare cases where children are or at risk of being sexually trafficked ; Child Protective Services, which includes assessments for familial and third - party child abuse allegations and certified resource parent assessments ; The appeals process for people with founded CPS dispositions; The CPS Mobile Team, which supports the delivery offices state wide ; and Continuous Quality Improvement, includ ing ongoing fidelity reviews in all 16 districts followed by the creation of Action Plans to make improvements to practice in screening and assessments. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page | 3 Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare - Child Safety Program Unit Form CPS caseworkers in local offices respond to and assess allegations of child abuse and neglect , for both familial and third party allegations. In 2022, the Child Safety Program established a new Oregon Administrative Rule to guide CPS caseworkers for third party CPS assessments that do not include assessing the parents' capacity for keeping their child safe . On all allegations of abuse and neglect, CPS caseworkers are usually the first contact for families. The CPS caseworkers also respond to and assess allegations in resource or foster homes certified by Child Welfare, O ffice of Intellectual & Developmental Disabilities , and Oregon Youth Authority . CPS staff work closely with law enforcement agencies and other members of multidisciplinary teams in each county to assess child abuse reports. When a child is unable to rema in safely in their home, f oster care is a temporary safety service, designed to keep children safe while Child Welfare works to manage safety threats and enhance the parents' protective capacities. The priority is to place children with kith/kin and work with families to make sure that children are only removed when an in -home safety plan cannot be implemented . When children are placed in care, which can only be done with court approval, Child Welfare places urgency on ensuring that children return home quickly and connect to family or other relatives whenever possible. Child abuse assessments are not voluntary. They are inherently intrusive and can be traumatic to families. Oregon's Safety Model is a family engagement model that requires C hild Welfare caseworkers to work and partner with families and children to gain a comprehensive understanding of family functioning. Historically , Oregon's CPS assessments were focused on the allegations. With the adoption of the Safety Model, CPS caseworkers must assess the allegation but also determine if family behaviors, conditions, or circumstance s are making children unsafe. Oregon's Safety Model consists of 16 universal safety threats that are analyzed from the safety -related information gathered by CPS Staff during the comprehensive safety assessment. The Child Safety Program can best be described in two sections: CPS Assessment and In -Home services. CPS Assessment From January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021, there were 175,038 contacts and 80,209 reports of child abuse or neglect ; approximately 25 percent of reports were assigned for safety assessments. As part of the comprehensive safety assessment, 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page | 4 Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare - Child Safety Program Unit Form the CPS case worker gathers comprehensive safety -related information in the following categories: Extent of the maltreatment, circumstances surrounding the abuse, adult functioning, child functioning, parenting practices and disciplinary practices. Cultural and linguistic considerations are also factored into the process. This important safety -related information is used to determine overall child safety. If children are determined to be safe a fter the comprehensive safety assessment, the case is closed. If children are determined to be unsafe, safety planning oc curs with either an in-home or out-of-home plan. The case will open, and the family will transition to a Permanency case worker once the CPS assessment concludes. The comprehensive safety assessment may take up to 60 days to complete based on the required elements of the safety model and CPS Assessment Rules. In-Home Safety and Reunification Services (ISRS) The ability to keep children safely at home is in large part dependent on the services that can be wrapped around the family to support them while safety concerns are addressed. Services are available to families during child abuse assessments when child safety issues are present. Services are designed to ensure a safe environment for children without removing them from their parent s or caregiver. If circumstances require a child to be removed from their parent or caregiver, these services provide the neces sary support to the family so the child can be safely reunited with their family. These services are specifically intended to help families remove barriers to managing identified safety threats with the goals of preventi ng of foster care placement by maint aining a child safely in the home with a parent or returning a child home to a parent. These services support crucial Child Welfare initiatives to increase the number of children who can remain safely at home after a safety threat is identified and decrease the length of time a child spends in foster care if removal is required. By contracting with a wide variety of providers, ISRS also allows for a culturally and linguistically specific approach to reducing the disproportionate placement of children of color in foster ca re. Over the year (FFY 2019), a total of 7,271 children were served in their homes. All children served in- home receive case management and safety services. Over 2,800 children (2,836 or 34.8 percent) also received additional services. Services offered primari ly fall within two categories: In-Home Safety and Reunification Services (ISRS) and Strengthening, Preserving and Reunifying Families (SPRF) Program Services. In -Home Safety and Reunification Services (ISRS) are services designed 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page | 5 Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare - Child Safety Program Unit Form to provide for the immedia te safety of children at risk of abuse by managing the safety threats within the family to prevent removal; or when children have been placed in protective custody, to help them return home with in -home safety services. The goal of these programs is to foster collaboration between state and community programs and resources, as well as help children remain safely with their families. State and community programs and resources can help stabilize the family in their time of need, work with the family to develop goals for family preservation services, family reunification services and empower the family to make changes that may alleviate the need for an out -of-home placement. These programs are potentially an enhancement to ISRS services and are delivered through contracts with community providers. Parents and families benefit from ODHS, and communities working together to provide stronger up-front services and use voluntary engagement in solutions, services, and supports to achieve more successful resolution of issues. Culturally relevant and linguistically specific services are especially important in helping African American and Native American children remain home with their families . A key partner for program success is the Department of Justice (DOJ) Attorney General's Office , which provides legal representation to ODHS for all juvenile dependency work involving children under its jurisdiction. Oregon Child Welfare has full representation by DOJ , which also files and litigates termination of parental rights cases. Program Justification and Link to Focus Areas There is a direct link between the Child Safety Program and the Healthy and Safe Communities focus area, in that Oregonians will be safe where they live, work and play. Each year, thousands of Oregon families come through the child welfare system due to allegations of child abuse or neglect. Child Welfare services are designed to strengthen families and to prevent further child abuse and neglect, prevent the unnecessary r emoval of children from families and promote reunification. Drug 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page | 6 Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare - Child Safety Program Unit Form and alcohol abuse, together with domestic violence, are the two major family stressors contributing to children entering foster care in Oregon. By supporting families early with services desi gned to keep children safely with their parents, costly foster care placements are avoided. The total average monthly cost per child in foster care in 20 20 was approximately $ 4,288. Program Performance The Child Safety Program measures its performance in three primary categories: First contact : To measure how well O DHS ensures initial child safety, the timeliness of first contact is measured for those reports of child abuse and neglect that are assigned for in -person investigation. According to ROM (Results -Oriented Management CPS.03), 71.2 percent of assignments met the required time period in 2021. The Department 's Program Improvement Plan will focus on this measurement for improvement. Assessment : ODHS measures the comprehensiveness of the CPS ass essment by the level of services that were provided and the appropriateness of safety planning for the child by monitoring whether the child experienced repeat maltreatment within 12 months of a prior abuse. The period for this federal measurement is 12 months and the state measurement are 6 months. Re-abuse: For 2021, Child Welfare is above the national standard of 9.1% for this measurement, at 12 percent . Cases involving parental factors of domestic violence and substance abuse continue to be identified as themes for re-abuse across the state. The Department' s Program Improvement Plan will focus on this measurement and activities to decrease re -abuse in Oregon . Enabling Legislation/Program Authorization ORS 419B.020 is the statute that mandates the Department and Law Enforcement to conduct investigations upon receipt of reports of child abuse or neglect. The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) is one of the key pieces of legislation that guides child protection. CAPTA, in its original inception, was signed into law in 1974 (P.L. 93- 247). It has been reauthorized in on multiple 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page | 7 Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare - Child Safety Program Unit Form occasions since then with multiple amendments that have strengthened and refined the scope of the law. ORS 418.575 through 418.598, Strengthening, Preserving and Reunifying Families legislation, was passed during the 2011 legislative session. The Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) also applies. Funding Resources Child Safety Program uses a combination of general and federal fund resources. Some of the resources are dedicated and do not require a match, while other fund sources are leveraged funds which are matched. Total Fund Split is 47 percent General Fund, 48 percent Federal Fund s and 5 percent Other Fund s. Federal and Other Fund Splits: Title IV -E, including Chafee ETV 11% The largest federal funding stream dedicated to child welfare purposes, Title IV- E of the Social Security Act provides support to states through five main programs: (1) foster care; (2) adoption assistance; (3) guardianship assistance; (4) Family First Prevention Services program; and (5) the John H. Chafee Foster Care Program for Successful Transition to Adulthood and Chafee Educati on and Training Vouchers Program. SSBG 23% Social Services Block Grant is a flexible source of federal funds that allows states to tailor social service programming to their populations' needs. Through the SSBG, states provide essential social services li nked to its goals to reduce dependency and promote self -sufficiency; protect children and adults from neglect, abuse and exploitation; and help individuals who are unable to take care of themselves to stay in their homes or to find the best institutional a rrangements. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page | 8 Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare - Child Safety Program Unit Form Title IV -B Sub-Part 1 5% Stephanie Tubb Jones Child Welfare Services promotes flexibility in the development and expansion of a coordinated child and family services program that utilizes community -based agencies and ensures all children are raised in safe, loving families. CWS funds can be used for a wide variety of child welfare services. Title IV -B Sub-Part 2 4% The purpose of MaryLee Allen Promoting Safe and Stable Families is to enable states to develop and operate coordinated programs of community -based family support services, family preservation services, family reunification services, and adoption promotion and support services. Family Violence Prevention and Services Act 4% The purpose of this funding resource is dedicated to the support of the emergency shelter and related assistance for victims of domestic violence and their children. TANF - EA 1% TANF is a federal block grant to states that operates according to four overarching purposes, one of which is to aid needy families with children so that the children can live in their own homes or the homes of relatives. For children removed from their homes due to abuse and neglect by their parents, TANF can be used to provide financial assistance and an array of s ervices to support children living with non- parent caregivers. In addition, federal law allows states to use TANF dollars for programs or activities a state conducted under its pre - 1996 (pre -TANF) Emergency Assistance program. Other Fund 5% These include dollars from the Child Abuse Prevention and treatment Act, the Children's Justice Act and the Victims of Crime Act. Also consists of child income -related funding which include but are not limited to: Child Support, Social Security Income and other Social Security Benefits (i.e., death benefits or disability benefits). 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page | 9 Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare - Child Safety Program Unit Form Funding Justification and Significant Changes to CSL Due to the timing of the release of GB, details lower than Division level were not available. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page | 1 Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare - Permanency Program Unit Form Oregon Department of Human Services : Permanency Primary Long -Term Focus Area: Healthy and Safe Communities Secondary Long -Term Focus Area: Achieving permanency for children involved with the child welfare system Program Contact: Kim Keller Program Overview The Child Permanency Program helps children in foster care achieve legal permanency through reunification, adoption or guardianship. If children achieve legal permanency through adoption or guardianship, this program continues to provide support to the families and their children to meet the ir special needs and lifelong challenges. - 2,000 4,000 6,000 8,000 10,000 12,000 14,000 - 50 100 150 200 250 CaseloadActual $ in MillionsPermanency General Fund Other Funds Federal Funds Caseload2023- 25 Ways and Means Page | 2 Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare - Permanency Program Unit Form Program Description The primary permanent plan for all children who enter the foster care system is reunification with a parent , except in rare circumstances . Reunification services are delivered through the efforts of delivery staff with consultation, support, training and technical assistance from central office consultation staff. If a child in foster care is unable to be safely reunited with a parent, Chil d Welfare pursues adoption or guardianship . Adoption and guardianship services are delivered through the joint efforts of delivery (field) and design staff. When children are unable to return to their parents' custody, the Division's efforts are directed to finding a permanent family so the children can leave the foster care system. Research shows that children who turn 18 and age out of the foster care system have poor er outcomes compared to children raised in a permanent home. Delivery staff carry out the process of preparing children for adoption or guardianship, legally freeing children for adoption, working with relatives for family support and/or placement or searching for an other appropriate permanent resource family, transitioning the child (ren), and monitoring the placement until the adoption or guardianship is finalized. Central office staff s upport delivery staff in determining which children should move toward an adoption plan and how to legally free them for adoption, ensuring the completeness of the file for adoption, negotiating Adoption Assistance, finalizing the adoption and supporting families after the adoption. Similarly, Design staff provide the same support and carr y out the same tasks when the plan is guardianship. During the 19-21 biennium, ODHS returned 3,976 children to a parent and completed 1,625 adoptions and 735 guardianships. Most children adopted or placed in guardianships through Oregon's foster care system are eligible for ongoing financial support and medical coverage. Overall, approximately 12,000 families receive ongoing adoption and guardianship financial support to assist with meet ing their children's special needs. Child Welfare also provi des administrative oversight in all private and independent adoptions and operate s a Search and Registry Program that is mandated by law. This adds program responsibility for an additional 700 to 900 children who are adopted privately or independently each year in Oregon. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page | 3 Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare - Permanency Program Unit Form ODHS works closely with the Department of Justice (DOJ) , which provides legal representation for ODHS caseworkers . DOJ also represents ODHS in termination of parental rights cases and in guardianship petitions. Other key partners include private mediators and attorneys, private adoption and recruitment agencies, the Oregon Post Adoption Resource Center , and the Division of Medical Assistance Programs at the Oregon Health Authority. Primary cost drivers for the Child Perma nency Program include the legal costs of representation throughout the case, freeing and placing children for adoption or filing for legal guardianships, contracted services, and costs associated with adoption and guardianship assistance. Based on their hi story of trauma caused by abuse and/or neglect, children adopted annually from the child welfare system are considered special needs children and eligible for an adoption subsidy. Families for approximately 95 percent of the eligible children choose to rec eive some monetary adoption assistance to assist in meeting these children's special needs. Children entering legal guardianships have the same history of trauma from abuse and/or neglect and are also eligible for subsidies. Most families accept the moneta ry support and medical coverage to meet the ongoing special needs of their guardian children. Program Justification and Link to Focus Areas The Child Permanency Program is designed to impact the safe and equitable reduction of children in foster care , which promotes h ealthy and s afe communities. Children in foster care , their parents and resource parents need targete d, family- focused, timely and culturally responsive servic es to achieve reunification. Those who cannot safely be reunified with their biological or legal parents need safe and appropriate alternate forms of permanency. Children who have experienced abuse and neglect are better able to recover from that trauma wh en they can achieve permanency . Evidence shows that children who do not have permanency are more likely to experience issues in the future such as lack of education, unemployment, homelessness and incarceration at much higher rates than the general population. Specifically, children formerly in foster care who age -out have higher rates of mental illness, including clinically diagnosed mental health problems, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. These children have a greater chance of involv ement with the corrections community, experiencing early parenting and/or using the services provided by the Oregon Health Authority and the Addictions 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page | 4 Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare - Permanency Program Unit Form and Mental Health program . The safety and stability that come with a permanent home help mitigate the risk of poor future outcomes for those who were abused and placed into foster care as children. Other non- monetary post -adoption and guardianship services are important in assisti ng families in providing care for children who often enter adoption and guardianship with significant special needs. Children who have experienced significant abuse and neglect will be challenged to address their history as they move through different deve lopmental stages. Ongoing support of families who are parenting these children is essential to preserve placements. Post -adoption and guardianship services provided by the Oregon Post Adoption Resource Center (ORPARC) include information and referral, cons ultation in response to imminent and current family crises, in-home family therapy, support groups, training, and a lending library. In calendar year 2021, 5,298 direct contacts were made for support, 4,135 people attended trainings, and there were 696 lib rary users. In addition, 15,649 unique web visitors were served through the Oregon Post Adoption Resource Center website. Children who disrupt from adoption or guardianship re -enter the foster care or residential treatment system at a significant cost to the state . Program Performance Program performance is measured in several ways , and data is consistently used to evaluate effectiveness. Currently the Child Permanency Program is focusing on specific performance measures and designing its program activities to impact these areas. They include children achieving permanency within 12 months of entering foster care, reducing the median months for children to exit the foster care system to reunification, adoption and guardianship , and improving the number of legally free children who are adopted in less than 12 months. PA.01 (Fed) Permanency in 12 Months Of all children who enter foster care in a target 12- month period, the percent discharged to permanency within 12 months of entering foster care Report Time Period: January 1, 2021 - December 31, 2021 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page | 5 Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare - Permanency Program Unit Form The Federal Standard for Permanency in 12 months is 40.5 percent or higher for children who have entered foster car e achieved permanency in less than 12 months.

Enabling Legislation/Program Authorization The following federal and state laws mandate the operation of permanency planning for children in the foster care system: 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page | 7 Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare - Permanency Program Unit Form Public Law 96 -272 Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 which established the program of adoption assistance and introduc ed the requirement to make reasonable efforts to keep children out of foster care Public Law 105 -89 The Adoption and Safe Families Act which set federal timelines for moving children out of foster care Social Security Act, Section 473 which mandates the pa yment of adoption assistance for eligible children Social Security Act, Section 473 which allows non -mandatory payment of guardianship assistance for eligible children Oregon Revised Statute 418.330 which provides state funded guardianship assistance The I ndian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) ORS 419A and 419B which provide a series of requirements for services to children in the foster care system ORS 109.309 which mandates the Department of Human Services to provide administrative services for independent adoptions , ORS 109.450 to operate a state Search and Registry program , and various other adoption related statutes within ORS Chapter 109. The Oregon Indian Child Welfare Act passed in 2020 which created provisions that promote Indian children's continued connection to culture, family and tribe. Funding Streams The adoption and guardianship subsidy programs are funded through a combination of General Fund dollars and federal Title IV -E funds.

ODHS is responsible for caring for children until they can safely live with their parents per ORS 418.015. These children are placed in the legal custody of ODHS by a court. Under limited circumstances and for a short time, a family may place a child in s tate custody voluntarily . However, most of the children served in foster care are there involuntarily , with court intervention, as a result of abuse or neglect they experienced in their family home. Program Description The Foster Care services program operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week to accept and care for children, youth , and young adults who cannot remain safely in their family homes. The children, youth and young adults range in age from newborn to 21 years old . In the federal fiscal year (FFY) 2021 , a total of 9,838 children spent at least one day in in family foster care, professional treatment programs, psychiatric residential treat ment, pre -adoptive placements, developmental disability placements and/or independent living, with the majority of these children and youth resid ing in family foster home settings. There were approximately 3,200 Oregon resource parent s or relative caregiver s for children needing placemen t as of the end of FFY 2021. ODHS partners with community members and organizations representing diverse community and cultural perspectives to deliver foster care services to children youth and young adults across the state. The agency has federal and state mandate s, as well as an internal vision, to provide efforts to reunify children with their parents. 54.7 percent of children entering care return ed home to a parent in FFY 2020 . There are approximately 37 licensed private Child Caring Agencies in Oregon that are caring for children and youth, most often because the child or youth has a significant behavior al or mental health need. Approximately 200 children are placed with License d Child Caring Agencies to provide a higher level of specialized care. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page | 3 Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare - Well -Being Program Program Unit Form The Child Well -Being program also responds to the overall well-being of the child, youth, or young adult in care. Well -being is identified as caring for and attending to the child's behavioral, emotional, educational , health and social functioning. This is best identified through meeting the core educational, physical, dental and mental health needs along with needs for family and community connections. Child Welfare support s programming that helps to attend to the safety and well- being needs of children, youth and young adults w hile expand ing the available service array to meet the unique and diverse needs of communities whose children have been historically overrepresented in child welfare systems. O DHS works in collaboration with multiple Tribal Nations ; state agencies such as the Oregon Health Authority, Oregon Youth Authority, Oregon Department of Education ; ODHS partner programs including the Office of Developmental Disabilities Services and Self-Suff iciency Programs ; and local law enforcement in addition to community programs, schools, business and faith communities and volunteer programs. With the Vison f or Transformation , Child Welfare continues to focus on safely and equitably reduc ing the number of children that enter the foster care system and provid ing for the care and well -being of children who do enter the system. Children who must enter the foster care system often have greater needs than those who can remain at home. The program needs well- trained and supported staff to meet the needs of children experiencing foster care, their parents and their resource parents. The average monthly cost per child in foster care is approximately $ 4,288 . There are multiple cost drivers to this program area including the number of children entering the substitute care system due to abuse or neglect, and the length of time they experience substitute care. A significant cost driver is an increased cost of living within the community and daily expenses for providing food, clothing, shelter, education , or other support services for children and youths. As an example, resource parents caring for a 10 -year -old child are currently reimbursed at a rate of $24.09 per day. This is intended to cover the cost of providing food, clothing, shelter, school supplies and the cost to participate in activities, etc. Often the additional costs for the child are paid for by the resource parent, which remains a barrier for many families and the private child -caring agencies across the state. After a 10 percent reduction in the reimbursement rates in 2011, they were last increased in 2018. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page | 4 Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare - Well -Being Program Program Unit Form Efficiencies to improve outcomes include a reinvestment in local community services to strengthen families and reduce the need for foster care. In addition, for children who are in foster care, efforts include increase d attention on the need for educational support and school placement continuity; increased access and continuity of comprehensive health care (physical, mental and dental health) ; resources/supports for older teens and young adults preparing to exit the foster care system ; and increased financi al and structural support for resource families and private agencies who care for the children and youth. The Well -being program is also responsible for the certification and support of resource families and relative caregivers who care for children in the Department's custody. This includes recruitment, assessment, retention, training and support. Training of these families is conducted both by agency staff and through contracted providers. Families participate in a Structured Analysis Family Evaluation (SAFE) home study assessment, designed to evaluate a family's readiness to meet the needs of children that enter the system. Program Justification and Link to Focus Areas The Child Well -Being Program is an integral part of the State's Plan to achieve a Safer, Healthier Community for the residents of Oregon. As a state policy , Child Well -Being programs are necessary to ensure safety for children if and when they are unable to remain safely with their families. Reliance on the foste r care system over the years has reached a capacity that is no longer sustainable in Oregon. The financial support for this system has not kept up with growing costs, which has negatively impacted the ability of potential resource families to step forward to provide family foster care. Ongoing research indicates that, if substantive preventive services are accessed quickly, many children can safely remain at home , which reduces the need for children to be placed into the foster care system. Re-directing resources away from the removal of children from families and increasing the capacity of families who currently have children in the substitute care system by investing in upfront and in - home services within communities will pay far greater dividends to Oregon in meeting the outcomes identified in the state's plan. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page | 5 Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare - Well -Being Program Program Unit Form Program Performance Program performance is measured in the following ways: The number of childre n entering foster care during FFY 202 1 (2,371) dropped from FFY 2020 (2,748 ), a decrease of 13.7 percent. The number of children leaving foster care decreased by 10.1 percent during the same period. For FFY 202 1, 54.3 percent of children who left foster care were reunified with their families. The m edian months to exit foster care is 21.3 months , which is higher than FFY 2020 (20.9 months). For children who were reunited with families, this time period includes t he trial home visit, which can be up to six months. The number of resource families (i.e., foster families ) on 9/30/ 2021 was 3,364 families. This is a decrease of 435 homes from 9/30/ 2020 . Teens (13 years and older) comprised 30.3 percent of the foster care population. A total of 2, 616 teens spent at least one day in foster care during FFY 2021. A total of 272 current and former foster care youth received scholarships for higher education for the 20 20-2021 school year through a federal grant awarded to ODHS and implemented with the assistance of the Office of Student Access and Completion. The number of youth receiving ILP services in FFY 202 1 (1,201 ) decreased by 3 .9 percent from FFY 20 20 (1,250). Enabling Legislation/Program Authorization Several federal acts are centered on the care for children through substitute care programs. Some of the more prominent federal acts and federal regulations are noted below. Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act P.L. 96- 272.

For children removed from their homes due to abuse and neglect by their parents, TANF can be used to provide financial assistance and an array of services to support child ren living with non- parent caregivers. In addition, federal law allows states to use TANF dollars for programs or activities a state conducted under its pre - 1996 (pre -TANF) Emergency Assistance program. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page | 8 Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare - Well -Being Program Program Unit Form Title XIX 5% Medicaid is a federal -state health care financing program that provides health insurance to millions of low-income individuals.

Engagement: Consumers are empowered by information, communication, and advocacy through strong, collaborative partnerships with stakeholders and rich community dialogue. About the Aging and People with Disabilities Program During the 2023 -25 biennium, Aging and People with Disabilities (A PD) expect s to serve: More than 36,000 older adults and people with physical disabilities per month who qualify for Medicaid -funded long -term services and supports; More than 90,000 older adults who benefit from Older Americans Act services ; 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |2 Oregon Department of Human Services Aging and People with Disabilities Program Narrative About 180,000 people who need nutrition assistance or Medicare Premium benefits ; About 44,500 people who live in long -term care se ttings that APD licenses ; More than 43,000 people who receive a Social Security Disability determination and need help accessing federal income benefits available to individuals with a disability ; More than 2,000 people ages 60 and older who seek help thro ugh Oregon Project Independence to remain living in their homes ; More than 4,000 individuals who will qualify for the Oregon Project Independence -Medicaid and Family Caregiver Assistance Programs. More than 2,000 people who receive long- term care options c ounseling from the Aging and Disability Resource Connection ; and Individuals who will make more than 50,000 calls seeking to report abuse or neglect or request information and referral services from Adult Protective Services APD encompasses the following programs and units: Aging and Disability Resource Connection Individuals living in Oregon needing information and referra l services about resources for older adults and people with disabilities, including APD programs or services, can contact the state's Aging and Disability Resource Connection (ADRC) of Oregon. The ADRC is a collaborative public -private partnership that streamlines consumer access to a complex aging and disability service delivery system. ADRC services are free to Oreg onians and the service raises visibility and awareness of the full range of options available. The ADRC provides trusted information and assistance to help people to make informed decisions. Through options counseling , Oregonians can develop action plans t o address long- term services and supports needs that align with consumer preferences, their financial situation, strengths, values and needs. If a person is likely to be eligible for Medicaid long- term services and supports, they will be referred to an APD local office or Area Agenc y on Aging (AAA) for a full eligibility assessment. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |3 Oregon Department of Human Services Aging and People with Disabilities Program Narrative Throughout Oregon, APD local offices and AAAs are responsible for providing direct client services. Employees also determine eligibility for older adults and people with disabilities for medical programs provided through the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) and for the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) . During the 2021 calendar year, the ADRC received 89,504 direct contacts and 159,305 website visits. The ADRC, as with all of APD, must keep pace with growth in the older adult population and is increasingly serving a more diverse population. APD strive s to identify disparities in outcomes for diverse populations , provide equitable access to services and identify strategies to serve all individuals in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner. Adult Protective Services APD and some AAA offices are responsible for investigating instances of abuse against older adults and person s with disabilities across the state. Abuse is costly both from a human and financial perspective. A person who has experienced abuse is likely to have increased health and long- term care costs. In Oregon, 18.2 percent of the population is over the age of 6 5 and 9.9 percent who are younger than 65 live with a disability. In 2021, local Adult Protective Services (APS) offices received a total of 47,818 calls. These numbers are slightly up from 2020, when local offices received 46,239 calls. Of the cases investigated, 25 percent to 35 percent were in community -based long- term care settings such as adult foster homes, assisted living facilities, residential care facilities and memory care settings . APS in 2021 completed 11,109 abuse investigations in community settings in 2021 , as well as 5,634 investigations in licensed long term care settings, though some investigations may have started in 2020. Financial exploitation and neglect remain the most common forms of abuse for older adults and people with disabilities. In the 2021 calendar year , 28 percent of abuse allegations in the community were for financial exploitation. Many alleged victims involved in APS investigations do not have Medicaid at the time of the investigation. APS involvement is often the first occasion that APD works with these individuals and help s protect them from neglect and harm . x 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |4 Oregon Department of Human Services Aging and People with Disabilities Program Narrative Safety, Oversight and Quality Unit The APD Safety, Oversight and Quality Unit (SOQ) licenses ma ny providers of long-term care for older adults and people with disabilities. The providers offer a wide range of services. Through oversight, investigation of complaints and reports of potential abus e, and corrective action, SOQ reduces future in cidence of unsafe conditions and improves the quality of care. These services are most effective when they are provided in a quality model aimed at preventing harm. The providers licensed by SOQ include adult foster homes, assisted living facilities, residential care facilities, nursing homes, conversion facilities, intensive intervention care facilities and facilities with memory care endorsements. SOQ strives to ensure service equity and the delivery of culturally and linguistically appropriate services. Medicaid Services Each month, a bout 36,000 older adults and people with physical disab ilities1 use Medicaid long- term services provided through APD. By federal law, each state must develop criteria for access to nursing facility care paid for by Medicaid. Criteria must include financial and asset tests as well as service eligibility criteria. The federal government, through Centers for Medicare and Me dicaid Services (CMS), must approve any criteria established by the states. Older adults and many individuals with disabilities need assistance from other people to perform daily activities and to ensure their health and safety and to meet their daily nee ds. To accurately identify those who need assistance, ODHS created a standardized assessment tool that idenfitites needs in activities of daily living (ADLs). From those ADLs, service priority levels (SPLs) determine eligibility for Medicaid long- term services and supports. SPLs prioritize services for older adults and people with physical disabilities whose well- being and survival would be in jeopardy without services. Level 1 reflects the highest level of need while Level 18 is reflects those individuals with the lowest level of need. ADLs are personal activities required for continued health and well-being and include mobility, eating, toileting, cognition, and personal hygiene. Prior to 2003, ODHS served 1 Includes individuals with traumatic and acquired brain injuries. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |5 Oregon Department of Human Services Aging and People with Disabilities Program Narrative individuals through SPL 17. Since then , because of budget constraints, only levels 1-13 have been funded. In 2021, the legislature approved an expansion through an 1115 demonstration waiver to provide supports to individuals who do not qualify for the traditional Medicaid long term services and supports. The new program will serve individuals with higher incomes and assets and those who meet SPL 14 through 18. Once determined elgibile, APD assists thousands of Oregonians who require ADL services as wel l as those requiring instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) services - which include housekeeping and meal preparation - in selecting competent providers and establishing effective working relationships with those providers. Due to the increasingly diverse population served, the program requires supports that are equally diverse and linguistically and culturally appropriate. Oregon Deaf and Hard of Hearing Services Oregon Deaf and Hard of Hearing Services (ODHHS) serves as a resource for all Oregonians, to improve quality of life for Deaf and hard of hearing people and their families. APD's ODHHS is engaged in ongoing training to improve the experience s of people seeking services and of public employees working with an agenc y. Senior Health Insurance Benefits Assistance (SHIBA) In 2021, there were 877,232 Medicare beneficiaries in Oregon. Older adults who are newly eligible for Medicare may be unsure about where to start with enrollment and may not understand which plan best fits their unique health care needs. The Senior Health Insurance Benefits Assistance (SHIBA) program offers Medicare -eligible adults and their families free, objective and comprehensive one - on-one benefits counseling so people can make informed decisi ons about their Medicare coverage. Direct services are provided by SHIBA staff and a team of nearly 200 certified volunteer counselors who provide information about what Medicare plans are available, help with Medicare appeals and educate consumers on how to protect, detect and report Medicare fraud, waste and abuse. During the 2021 federal fiscal 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |6 Oregon Department of Human Services Aging and People with Disabilities Program Narrative year, SHIBA certified counselors provided 16,013 one -on-one counseling sessions to Oregonians. Services, Design and Delivery APD's budget is sectioned into thr ee key areas : program services, program design and program delivery. Program services focus on supporting older adults and people with disabilities in maintaining the utmost independence while supporting their individual needs. Services are provided through the following : Older Americans Act Oregon Project Independence Financial s upport services In-home services Community -based care facilities including adult foster homes Nursing facilities Older Americans Act A federal program , the Older Americans Act is administered in Oregon through APD as the State Unit on Aging. It provides federal funding for locally developed programs serving individuals ages 60 and older. APD distributes funds to local Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs) for service delivery through subcontractors. It is estimated that approximately 85,000 Oregonians currently access these services . The AAA s develop services that are within federal expectations and meet the needs and preferences unique to individuals in their local area. Program mandates require that services target those with the most significant economic and social need, to minorities and to those residing in rural areas. There are no income or asset requirements to receive services except those related to the Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP) . 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |7 Oregon Department of Human Services Aging and People with Disabilities Program Narrative APD distributes federal funds to the AAAs using a federally approved intra -state funding formula that's based on the demog raphics and square mileage of each area. APD encourages and incentivizes culturally specific and linguistically competent supports within all programs. Programs include family caregiver supports, nutrition via congregate and home -delivered meal programs, older adult employment , legal services, elder abuse prevention services and more . Most AAAs also sponsor and promote evidence -based wellness and chronic health condition management activities , and many also provide assistance to local senior centers. Oregon Project Independence (OPI) OPI is a state -funded program offering in -home services and related supports to individuals 60 years of age and older or people who have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's or a r elated dementia disorder. Approximately 2,000 Oregonians are served in this program during a calendar year . OPI represents a critical element in Oregon's strategy for prevent ing or delay ing instances where individuals must leave their own homes to r eceiv e services in more expensive facility settings - or depleting their personal assets sooner than necessary and accessing more expensive Medicaid health and long- term service benefits. The program was expanded by the 2005 Oregon Legislature to include younger adults with disabilities. However, funding was not provided until 2014 and 2015 . The funding allowed for a pilot program to expand the program to adults ages 19-59 with physical disabilities. OPI is administered statewide by local Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs). Many areas have waiting lists due to high demand and limited program funding. Client eligibility is determined by an assessme nt of functional ability and natural supports related to activities of daily living. Typical services include assistance with housekeeping, bathing, grooming, health care tasks, meal preparation, caregiver respite, chore services, adult day service s and transportation. The OPI program has no financial asset limitations for clients. A sliding fee scale is applied to clients with net monthly income between 100 and 200 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) to pay toward the cost of service. A sma ll grou p with income above 200 percent of FPL pays the full rate for services provided. Generally, this is because they benefit from case management and ongoing support and monitoring in addition to the purchased services. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |8 Oregon Department of Human Services Aging and People with Disabilities Program Narrative Financial support services APD has p rograms designed to meet a v ariety of special circumstances for certain low-income populations. These include: a.) General assistance (GA) program - With this program, APD serves individuals with severe disabilities who are experiencing homelessness or who are at risk of homelessness. To be eligible for the GA progr am, individuals must meet all the following criteria: o Be experiencing homeless ness or at risk of experiencing homelessness. o Be an adult, age 18 -64, with no minor children living with them. o Have a severe disability that meets Social Security disability criteria. o Be receiving Presumptive Medicaid medical assistance. o Meet all eligibility criteria for Supplemental Security Income (SSI). o Apply for SSI and appeal any denials received; and o Sign an Interim Assistance Agreement (IAR), allowing ODHS to recover GA funds paid to them once awarded SSA benefits. General assistance program benefits include up to $545 per month in housing assistance, $90 in utility assistance per month, $60 in cash assistance per month, and free assistance with the Social Security application and appeals process. b.) Cash payments - special needs - APD is required to meet maintenance of effort (MOE) p ayment s for low-income aged and disabled Oregonians who receive federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits. These benefits are focused on payments that allow clients to maintain independence and mobility in a safe environment . Examples of special needs payments include help for non -medical transportation, repairs of broken appliances such as a furnace , or for such things as adapting a home's stairs into a ramp. c.) Employed Persons with Disabilities Program (EPD) - This program allows people with a disability to work to their full extent and not lose Medicaid coverage. To be eligible, a person must be deemed to have a disability by Social Security Administratio n criteria, be employed and have adjusted income of less than 250 percent of FPL . Eligible individuals pay a monthly 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |9 Oregon Department of Human Services Aging and People with Disabilities Program Narrative participation fee and are eligible for the full range of Medicaid benefits and services, including long term services and supports. d.) Other benefits - Medicare eligible individuals often need help paying for their Medicare related cost sharing requirements. APD determines client eligibility and submits client data to CMS for two Medicare -related programs: Medicare buy -in and Medicare Part D low -income subsidy. A PD served more than 140,000 clients in March 2020 in these two programs. These programs may help low- income Medicare beneficiaries with their Part B premiums, deductibles, and co -payments. Securing this coverage also ensures Medicare remains in a \"first payor\" status, ultimately saving the state's Medicaid program significant money. Social Security Disability Determination Services APD determines eligibility for Social Security Disability and Supplemental Security Income benefits on behalf of the Social Security Administration. In 2020 , 33,617 cases were adjudicated which increased to 38,785 cases in 2021. Medicaid Services and Supports Medicaid -funded long-term services and supports assist eligible individuals with fundamental ADLs such as mobility, elimination, cognition, eating, bathing, dressing and personal hygiene. These services ensure that the person is living in a safe and healthy environment. All services promote choice, independence, and dignity. Services c an be provided in nursing facilities or in community settings such as residential care, assisted living, memory care or foster homes, or in the person's own home. Oregon has been able to create cost -effective programs that meet people's needs in their hom es and other community settings using these options , sparing Oregonians from the unnecessary use of much higher cost services, primarily those offered in nursing facilities. All options are funded with support of the Medicaid program through home - and comm unity -based waivers or state plan options. In-home services are the cornerstone of Oregon's community- based care system and were created to meet the preferences of older adults and people with disabilities throughout Oregon . For older adults or people with physical disabilities, the ability to live in their own homes is compromised by the need for 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |10 Oregon Department of Human Services Aging and People with Disabilities Program Narrative support in regular activities of daily living (ADLs) . For more than 25 years , Oregon has created options to meet people's needs in their own homes. Services to older adults and people with physical disabilities are designed to support assistance with fundamental ADLs including mobility, cognition, eating, elimination, personal hygiene, dressing, and bathing. To receive in -home services, an individual must be financially eligible for Medicaid and meet SPL criteria . A case manager work s with the client and together they identify needs and develop a plan for the in- home services. There are different options that an individual can select to receive in -home services. a.) Medicaid client-employed Home care W orkers : Home care Workers (HCW) are hired directly by the consumer and provide many of the services Medicaid recipients need to remain in their own homes. The consumer, or their selected representative, is responsible for performing the duties of an employer. These duties include selecting, hiring, and providing on- site direc tion in the performance of provider duties that are authorized by a case manager to meet the client's individual needs. The HCW must pass a criminal background check performed by the state . In partnership with the consumer , APD develops and authorizes a se rvice plan, makes payment to the HCW on behalf of the consumer and provides ongoing contact with the consumer to ensure service needs are met. About 19,000 consumers are expected to receive services supplied by HCWs by the end of the 20 21-23 biennium . The Oregon Home Care Commission ( HCC ) was established in 2000 by an amendment to the Oregon Constitution. It is a public commission dedicated to ensuring high-quality home care services to individuals using c onsumer - employed providers. Service Employees International Union Local 503, Oregon Public Employees Union , represents approximately 1 6,000 HCWs. For purposes of collective bargaining, HCC serves as the HCW employer of record. The c ommission maintains a statewide, computerized registry of workers and provides an extensive training curriculum. The HCC also makes training available to clients to better understand their employer responsibilities and increase their skill in managing the use of HCWs. b.) In-home agency services : Many clients prefer to receive their in- home services through an in-home care agency. In -home care agencies (IHCA) are licensed by the Oregon Health Authority. These agencies employ, assign and 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |11 Oregon Department of Human Services Aging and People with Disabilities Program Narrative schedule caregivers to perform the tasks authorized by the client's case manager. APD contracts with licensed IHCAs throughout the state. IHCAs work closely with ODHS case managers and clients to ensure services are provided as authorized and to ensure the quality of the work performed. c.) Medicaid Independent Choices Program: This program offers choice s to clients in the way they receive in- home services and increases clients' self - direction and independence . Clients receive a cash benefit based on their assessed need. They purchase and directly pay for services. Clients are responsible for locating prov iders, paying their employees, and withholding and paying necessary taxes. Depending upon how they manage their service benefit, many can purchase a few additional services or items otherwise not covered by Medicaid to increase their independence or well- being. d.) Medicaid adult day services: Adult Day Services (ADS) provide supervision and care for clients with functional or cognitive impairments. Service may be provided for half or full days in stand-alone centers, hospitals, senior centers, and licensed care facilities. ADS providers are certified, but not licensed, by ODH S. e.) Medicaid home -delivered meals : Home -delivered meals are provided to those who are ho mebound and unable to go to sites, such as senior centers, for meals. These programs generally provide a hot midday meal and often frozen meals for days of the week bey ond the provider's delivery schedule. f.) Medicaid (state plan) personal care services : Individuals who do not meet service priority levels ( SPLs), but have some personal care needs, may qualify for Medicaid Personal Care Services. Services are generally limited to no more than 20 hours a month. Personal care services are more limited than the standard Medicaid Long -term Services and Supports benefit. g.) Medicaid specialized living services: The services are provided through a contract with APD and targeted to a specific group of clients living in their own apartments and assisted by a specialized program offering direct service and structured supports. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |12 Oregon Department of Human Services Aging and People with Disabilities Program Narrative Community -based facilities Community -based facilities include a variety of 24- hour care settings and services that provide alternative s to nursing facilities. Services include assistance with ADLs , medication oversight and social activities. Services can also include nursing and behavioral supports to meet complex needs. These facilities, all of which must meet s tate and federal guidelines related to health and safety, include the following: a.) Adult foster homes: Services are provided in home -like settings licensed for five or fewer individuals who are not related to the foster home provider. Homes may specialize in certain services, such as serving ventilator - dependent residents. b.) Assisted living and r esidential care facilities: Licensed 24-hour service settings serve six or more residents and f acilities range in size from six to more than 100 beds. The difference between residential care and assisted living is generally in the structural set up of the facility and the fact that individuals typically have shared rooms in residential care . Either type of facility can seek a Memory Care endorsement on top of the underlying licensure , provided the y meet additional requirements for Memory Care Facilities. Registered nurse consultation services are required by regulation. c.) Conversion facilities : A conversion facility is a nursing facility that has decided to \"convert\" its license to that of a residential ca re facility. The facility must go through the federal process of closing the nursing facility before going through a state process for converting the building to a residential care facility. d.) Intensive intervention care facilities: Intensive Intervention Care (IIC) facilities are small residential care facilities designed to serve individuals with significant behavioral and mental health needs. Five or fewer people can live in a single IIC home. e.) Enhanced care services : Specialized 24-hour programs in licensed care settings that provide intensive behavioral supports for older adults and people with physical disabilities who have needs that cannot be met in any other setting. These programs support clients with combined funding from APD and the Oregon Health Authority's mental health program . 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |13 Oregon Department of Human Services Aging and People with Disabilities Program Narrative f.) Memory Care Community Endorsement : These facilities are licensed as an Assisted Living Facility or Residential Care Facility or Nursing Facility and serve individuals with Alzheimer's disease , other forms of dementia and other cognitive diseases . They are required to have enhanced training and a more secure setting for their residents. The endorsement is in addition to the underlying licensure. g.) Program for the All -inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) : PACE is a fully capitated Medicare/Medicaid program built on a care model that combines all Medicare and Medicaid medical services and long-term services and supports into one program . Currently, about 1,700 Oregonians ages 55 and older are served in this program . PACE program s are responsible for providing and coordinating their clients' full health and long -term service needs in these settings or in an in -home setting . Nursing facilitie s Institutional services for older adults and people with physical disabilities are provided in nursing facilities licensed and regulated by ODHS . Nursing facilities provide individuals with skilled nursing services, related services, and ongoing assistance with activities of daily living. Oregon has led the nation since 1981 in the development of lower cost alternatives to institutional (nursing facility) care. Home - and community- based alternatives to nursing facility services emphasize independence, dignity and choice and offer needed services and supports at lower costs than medical models. Program Design - APD programs are supported by a variety of staff and services. These include: Central leadership and administration Medicaid financial eligibility Long Term Services and Supports eligibility, design and oversight Development and maintenance of policy and administrative rules Oversight of licensed care facilities 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |14 Oregon Department of Human Services Aging and People with Disabilities Program Narrative Ensuring Medicaid provider enrollment Support and leadership for various statutorily required advisory councils. Administration of the Older Americans Act Home Care Commission . Program Delivery - Direct services to Oregonians are provided through : Direct service staff located in local offices throughout the state including financial eligibility staff Case management Presumptive Medicaid Disability Determination Team State Family/ Pre -SSI Disability Determination Services Administration of Medicare Modernization Act and Buy- in programs Provider payments and relations Adult Protective Services investigations Adult Foster Home , Nursing Facility and Community Based Care licensing Long term care referral services registry Eligibility and case management services are delivered throughout the state by APD and A rea Agency on Aging (AAA) employees. ORS Chapter 410 allows AAAs , which are governmental entities, to determine which populations they wish to serve and which programs they wish to administer. Type B Transfer AAAs choose to provide Medicaid services in addition to Older Americans Act and OPI services. In areas where the AAAs (Type A - AAAs) do not prov ide Medicaid services, APD has local offices to serve older adults and people with disabilities. APD and AAA case managers perform a variety of roles in serving older adults and people with disabilities and are the fr ont line in protecting individuals fro m 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |15 Oregon Department of Human Services Aging and People with Disabilities Program Narrative abuse and neg lect. They determine eligibility for long-term services and supports and assist individuals in developing person-centered service plans, accessing supports through APD and other programs , and find ing qualified providers. They also address issues and concerns regarding providers and act as advocates and champions for consumer rights. APD case managers face increasingly complex work. APD has implemented Waivered Case Management expectations requiring monthly contact on every case. Due to changes to the Fair Labor Standards Act, APD added more responsibilities on working with home care workers, including managing hourly caps, limiting overtime, and ensuring access to adequate services. Based on federal expectations, APD has also increas ed expectations related to person -centered planning and ensuring individuals ' safety. Legal requirements have made due process notices more complex and detailed, requiring more case management time to issue each notice. History During the past 40 years, there has been a profound shift in society's understanding of the importance of supporting the independence of older adults and people with disabilities. Traditionally, states provided Medicaid long term services and supports in institutional settings such as nursing facilities. Oregon's first nursing facility opened in the 1940s. With the passage of the federal statute creating Medicaid, the state began to pay for nursing facility services for eligible individuals in the 1960s. The Older Americans Act , also passed in the 1960s, has gradually expanded additional protections and services to vulnerable older adults, including access to home -delivered meals, senior centers, transportation, family caregiver support and legal services a s well as support t hrough the Office of the Long -Term Care Ombudsman to uphold rights and resolve complaints. As professional standards and public thinking about how to best serve older adults and people with disabilities began to change , community living options became more accessible. Leading the nation in the 1970s, Oregon developed legislation that recognized the importance of assisting older adults in maintaining their independence and honoring their inherent dignity. Later, on a national level, the Americans with Disabilities Act strengthened and expanded civil rights in the areas of employment, public accommodations, transportation, and housing. As 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |16 Oregon Department of Human Services Aging and People with Disabilities Program Narrative accessibility increased, t he right to c ommunity integration became more attainable for individuals with disabilities and families had more options for members to be able to receive needed supports at home. Federal dollars to fund Medicaid waivers first became available in 1981 for Home and Community -Based Services . That same year , the Oregon Legislature updated its policies around disabilities and found that significant numbers of people with disabilities lived in institutions because adequate community services did not exist. The legislature mandated that the state work to empower people with disabilities, keep them as independent as possible and develop service settings that were alternatives to institutionalization. The 1981 Oregon Legislature also created the Senior Services Divi sion and a strong statutory mandate to support older adults in their own homes and community settings outside of institutions. This action forged the way for Oregon to lead the nation in the development of lower -cost alternatives to institutional care. In response to the legislative mandate, Oregon applied for and received the first home and community-based waiver that allowed Medicaid funds to provide long- term services outside an institution. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Oregon received waivers that a llowed services for unique groups of people . For Medicaid- eligible older adults and people with disabilities in Oregon, this has meant that the provision of long -term care has, in large measure, shifted away from nursing facilities to in -home services, ass isted living facilities, residential care facilities and adult foster homes. In 2013, APD worked with the legislature to shift from waivers to a state plan that allowed the state to gain additional federal funds to support individuals receiving services through the Medicaid program. Future populations The aging population is growing rapidly across the nation. The number of people 65 and older in the United States is expected to increase to 70 millio n by 2030, and to 88.5 million - 20 percent of the population - in 2050. We can expect the aging population in Oregon to continue to grow dramatically as more baby- boomers reach retirement age. In 2016, approximately 17 percent of Oregon's population was 65 years or older. By 2030, the percentage is expected to increase to nearly 20 percent. In addition, nearly 10 percent of Oregon's population 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |17 Oregon Department of Human Services Aging and People with Disabilities Program Narrative that is younger than 65 is living wi th a disability. Further, Oregon ians 85 years or older make up a small but rapidly growing group within the total population. Guided by the ODHS Equity North Star, APD programs and services continue to evolve through a focus on equity and inclu sion for individuals of all races, ethnicities, sexual orientation s, gender identities and expressions, disabilit ies, age s, geographic locations, and Tribal affiliations. By w orking closely with communities to design and deliver services, APD helps ensure that all of Oregon's older adults and people with disabilities have access to the supports they need to achieve and maintain whole well -being. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|1 Oregon Depa rtment of Huma n Services Aging and Peopl e with Disabilities Delivery and Design Program Unit Form Oregon Department of Human Services : De livery and Design Primary Long -Term Focus Area: Safer, Healthier Communities Secondary Long -Term Focus Area: Program Contact: Nake shia K night -Coyl e APD expect s to see a reb ound in caseloa d growth in the coming biennium with increased complexity in the individuals it s erves.

Among these servic es are: Aging and Disability Resource Connection (ADRC) ; Adult Protective Ser vices (APS) ; Disability Deter mination Services; Financia l Eligibility Determinations , including Medicare Premium Assistance, General Assistance and Supplemental Nu trition Assistance Program (S NAP); Long -Term Care Licensing ; Medicaid Long- Term Care Servic es and Support s; Older American s Act (includes meals and j ob support) ; Oregon Deaf and Hard of Hearing Services ; Oregon Home Care Commission; Oregon Project Independence (OPI) ; and Senior Health Insurance Benefits Assistance . About 180,00 0 individuals a ccess fina ncially based service s such as medical assistanc e and are served by eligibility staff only; case management services are provided to individuals accessing long term services and supports . Approximately 36,000 of the 180,000 individuals who receive financia lly based se rvices also access Medicaid long-ter m care services and supports . For th ese individuals, local case management ser vices generally consist of assessment, choices counseling, service plan de velopment , risk monitoring and ongoing monitor ing. Addit ionally, local office s have memorandums of under standing (MOUs) with local Coordinat ed Care O rganizations. These MOUs focus on joint accountability for coordinating care for individuals accessi ng long -term care services. State and Area Agency on 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|3 Oregon Depa rtment of Huma n Services Aging and Peopl e with Disabilities Delivery and Design Program Unit Form Aging (AAA ) case man agers are the front line in ensuring e ffective care coordination occurs for i ndividuals served by APD's long- term care system. Local staff license adult foster homes, including thos e that do not par ticipate in Medicaid. Local staff also provide adult prot ective ser vices , consisting of invest igations of abuse and neglect agains t seniors and people with disabilities . APD has historically earned local service delivery staff through a caseloa d ratio model (e.g. one eligibility worker for every 500 cases) . In the 2013- 15 biennium, the Legislatur e authorized the tra nsition to a worklo ad model. This model differs from the cas eload ratio model in that it measures time required to perform task s and c aptures wo rk performed for individual s who a re never fou nd eligibl e. Howeve r, the model has fallen out of date recently and needs an overhau l. Additionally, it only captures the wor k that staff are able to do and does not account for changes in expectation s and the work they are unable to complete. The delive ry system is compri sed of both state staff and staff with A rea Agencies on Aging ( AAA ) located in communities throughout Oregon. Under ORS 410.270, AAAs have the right to elect to deliver Medicaid service s locally. Currentl y, four AAAs have ele cted this op tion. These four AAAs (Multnomah County, N orthwest Senior and Disability Servi ces, Oregon Cascades West Council of Gover nment . and Lane Council of Governments ) serve the most populous areas of Oregon. APD serves the remainde r of th e state including Washingt on and Clackamas counties. The Oregon Ho me C are Commission ( OHCC) is also in cluded in the Design and Delivery Program Area. Under Oregon's constitution, the OHCC is responsible for ensuring the quality of home care servic es for older adults and peopl e with disabilities. Th e Commission maintains a website of homecare worke rs, personal support workers and perso nal care attendants that can be accessed by all people living in Oregonians, includi ng those not served by Medi caid. Training is provided to both consumers of services and hom ecare wo rkers in a variety of areas addressing safety and quality. The eff orts of the OHCC are critical to the successful delivery of long -term care services to Ore gonians . Finally , the Senior Health Insurance Benefit s Assistance (SHIBA) unit offer s Medicare eligible adults and their familie s free, objective and comprehensive one - on-one benefits counsel ing so people can make informed decisions about their Medicare coverage. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|4 Oregon Depa rtment of Huma n Services Aging and Peopl e with Disabilities Delivery and Design Program Unit Form Direct services are provided by SHIBA staff and a team of nearly 200 certified counselors who volunte er their time to provide information about what Medicare plans are available, he lp with Medicare appeals and educate consumers on how to protec t, detect and report Medica re fraud, waste and abuse. D uring the 20 21 federal fiscal y ear, SHIBA certified counse lors provided 16, 013 one -on-one counseling sessions to Oregonians with questions about Medicare . APD's Design and Delivery area also includes the staff that design and administer services centrally . Some of th e major services provided include: Negotiat ing system desi gn with federal partner s; Developing program policy and m aintaining administrative rules ; Paying providers; Executing contracts ; Negotiating and implementing c ollective bargainin g agreements; and Maintain ing provid er rates. Program Justific ation and Link to Focus Areas There is a direct link between this program and the goal of Safer, Healt hier Communities. The APD Delivery system support s individuals living in the ir communit ies in settings of their choic e, whether in their own hom e, a commu nity- based care facilit y or a nursing facility. Partnerships between local law enforcement, local court systems, and local advocates are critical to ensur ing that older adults and people with disabi lities are protected from negle ct and abuse . Enabling Le gislation/Program Authorization Oregon Revised Statutes 410.070 charges the agency with primary responsibility for the planning, coordination, developm ent, and evaluation of policy, programs and ser vices for older adult s and pe ople with disa bilities in Ore gon. Area Agencies on Aging have universal responsibilities as articulated in ORS 410.210. Additionally, ORS 410. 270 authorizes Area Agencie s on Aging to perform service s locally that would otherwis e be admin istered by state staf f if they elect to do so. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|5 Oregon Depa rtment of Huma n Services Aging and Peopl e with Disabilities Delivery and Design Program Unit Form Funding Justificat ion and Significant Changes to CSL Due to the timing of the release of GB, details lower than Division level were not available . 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|1 Oregon Depa rtment of Huma n Services Aging and People w ith Disabilities Community- Based Care Program Unit Form Oregon Department of Human Services : Medicaid Long -Term Care Community -Based Care Primary Long -Term Focus Area: Safer, Healthier Communities Secondary Long -Term Focus Area: Program Contact: Nake shia K night -Coyle Program Overview Community -based c are is considered the middle laye r of Oregon's long -term care continuum and include s a variety of 24 -hour care settings and services for older adults and people with physical disabilities who are unable to per form all of their own activiti es of daily living. These services ar e part of Oregon's nationally recognized h ome and co mmunity -based care system, which provides a critical, cost-effective alternative to nursing facilities. Eligibility for services is based upon a combination of finan cial criteria and service needs. An individual' s service needs are c alculate d as a \"servi ce priority level\" which ranges from 1 (highest need) to 18 (lowest need). In the 2003 budget crisis, funding to serve individuals with service prior ity levels 14 through 17 was eliminated (SPL 18 was not funded at that time) . These le vels remain un funded 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|2 Oregon Depa rtment of Huma n Services Aging and People w ith Disabilities Community- Based Care Program Unit Form through Medicaid; h owever, some (not all) of the needs can be met for these individuals through Older Americans Act and Oregon Project Independence programs. Program Desc ription The S tate of Oregon strive s to meet the needs and expectations of increasingly diverse populations, and c ommunity -based care provides a critical alternative to nursing facilities for s eniors and people with disabi lities who cannot meet their own da ily needs. Eligibility for long -term care ser vices and supports is based upon a combination of financial criteria and service needs. Recipients contribute their own funds toward room and board directly to community- based care fac ilities, wh ile the state pays for serv ices consisting most ly of assistance wit h activities of daily l iving (walking, transf erring, eating, dressing, grooming, bathing, hygiene, toileting, and cognition) and instrumental activiti es of daily living (meal pre paration, housekeeping, laundry, shopp ing, medication , and oxygen manage ment). Nursing facility care is a guaranteed Medica id be nefit to eligible individuals. If the state did not use alternatives to nursing facility level of ca re, more than 31, 000 individ uals, includin g more than 12, 000 in communi ty-based care settings , would likely be receiving services in nursing facilities at approximately 300 percent of the cost of community -based care services. Community -based care includes: Adult foste r homes , which serve five or fewer individuals in a home -like setting. Residen tial care f acilities (RCF) , which serve six or more individuals in a facili ty with private or shared rooms and common areas. Assisted l iving faci lities (ALF) , which serve six or more individuals in thei r own apartments. Memory care fac ilities, licensed as either an ALF or RCF, with an endorsement allowing them to specialize in serving individuals with dementia. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|3 Oregon Depa rtment of Huma n Services Aging and People w ith Disabilities Community- Based Care Program Unit Form Enhanced -care services , which serve APD eligibl e individuals complicated by significant mental health needs. This program is jointly funded betwe en ODHS and th e Oregon Health Authority. Program of All -Inclusive Ca re for the Elderly (PACE) serve s more than 1,750 individuals via a fully capit ated premium . The program is jointly funded with Medicare and Medicaid dollars and prov ides an integrated program for medica l and l ong-term services. Participants are 55 years of age or older, generally attend adult day services , and live in a variety of settings repres entative of Oreg on's long -term care continuum . PACE provider s are respon sible for providing and coordinating the full health and long -term service needs of their clien ts in all of these setting types . APD competes with the private pay market for access to most commun ity-based care. Most facilities have a mix of pri vate pay an d Medicaid residents. As the society a ges and if the economy strengthens, APD may lose access due to competition for open beds with the private pa y market. Adult foster homes are re presented by SEIU and have c ollective bargaining rights. Factors such as saf ety and quality canno t be negotiated; however , issues such as training, and service rates are ma ndatory subjects of bargaining. Each communit y-based c are setting mu st meet fede ral and state laws and regul ations related to health, safety, and se rvice delive ry. Mandatory servic es include assistance wi th activities of daily living, medication oversight , and social activities. Some settings that ser ve individuals with more complex needs may include ad ditional services , such as nursing and behavioral supports. Program Justifica tion and Link to Focus Ar eas Community -based c are is a direct link to the S afer, Healthier Communities focus area (Oregonians ar e healthy and ha ve the best po ssible quality of life at all ages ). The program maximizes federal resources while reducing unnece ssary costs in higher lev els of care. With one of the lowest levels of nursi ng facility utilization in the country, Oregon i s at the forefront o f using community -based care as a core alternative to nursing facilities. With ongoing supp ort, Oregon can meet the target of ser ving 90 percent of the publicly funded long -term care casel oad in- home and community -based care in the next five years (up from 86 percent ). 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|4 Oregon Depa rtment of Huma n Services Aging and People w ith Disabilities Community- Based Care Program Unit Form Program Per forma nce A key goal of the Oregon Department of Human Services ( ODHS) is that people are safe and livi ng as independen tly as possible. O DHS currently measures this goal based on the percentage of individuals living in thei r own homes in lieu of a licensed care facility, as well as the percentage of indiv iduals who move to a less restrictiv e service setting s such as communit y- based care . Commu nity-based c are service plans have been proven to be a cost -effe ctive alterna tive to n ursing facilit y care. Costs range by facility type and as sessed need of the individual. The monthly average cost by set ting is as foll ows: Adult Foster Home : $4,965 Regular Residential Care Facility : $1,795 Contracted Residential Care Facility : $6,190 The cost of si milar services provi ded in a nursing f acility exceeds $1 3,400 per month. Enabling Legislation/Program Authorization Community -based c are is operated under a variety of Medic aid home and community -based options . The newest mechanism is the 1915(k) State Plan Option or, \"K plan.\" Through the K plan the state p rovides services that substitute f or nursing facility services , the mandated benefit for Medicaid eligible individuals. The K plan pro vides an enhanced federal match a llowing th e state to draw down additional federal fun ds to su pport the Medicaid program . Additionally , ORS 410 and ORS 443 provide statutory policy and structure to the services offered. Funding Streams Community -based car e services are funde d through the Medicaid pr ogram . The services are designed and appr oved usi ng Medicaid 1 915c Home a nd Com munity - Based Waiver s, and primarily, the Community First Choice Option in the Medica id State Plan .

There is a small amount of funding from the estates of 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|5 Oregon Depa rtment of Huma n Services Aging and People w ith Disabilities Community- Based Care Program Unit Form former recipients. When a Medicaid recipient passes away, ODHS is required by federal law to recover money spe nt for the individual's car e from the recipient's estate. These funds are rei nvested in services for other individuals, offsetting the need for general funds.

In 2021 -23 there was a sig nificant federal funds increase from Home and Community Based American Rescue Plan Act. Program Overview In-home services are the least restrictive service offered in Oregon's long -term care continuum. This pr ogram funds Medicaid long- term care services to older adults and people with disabilities in their own homes. Individuals are eligible to receive the same service s in a nursing facility. In 2013, Oregon added a new Medicaid, 1915( k) State Plan Option, or \"K pla n,\" that pr ovides additional flexibility and federal funds. Approximately 52 percent of individuals served in Oregon's long- term care system are served in th eir own homes. In-home services offer an opportunity to provide individualized care in a respectfu l, sensitive, and inclusive manner to Oregonians from a variety of diverse backgrounds. 2023- 25 ways and Means Page |2 Oregon Department of Human Services Aging and People with Disabilities In-Home Services Program Unit F orm Program Description This cost-effective program enables older adults who have low income s and people with disabilities to remain in their own ho mes a nd esta blished communities. Individuals from culturally diverse backgrounds benefit from this program that provides enhanced independence, health, safety, and quality of life . Oregon's model of long-term care is referred to as a social model, distinct ly differen t from a medical model of care. Social models of care focus on client autonomy, respect, choice , and individualized care planning. Individual s are viewed holistically and provided with supports that enhance independence, dignity and respect. Eligibilit y for serv ices is based upon a combination of financial criteria and service needs. An individual's service needs are calculate d as a \"service priority level\" which ranges f rom 1 (highest need) to 18 (lowest need). In the 2003 budget crisis, funding to ser ve individu als with service priority levels 14 through 17 was eliminated (SPL 18 was not funded at that time) . These levels remain unfunded through Med icaid; h owever, some ( not all) of the needs c an be met for these individuals through Older Americans Act and Oregon Project Independence programs. In-home supports inc lude necessary assistance with activities of daily l iving (walking, transferring, eati ng, dressing, grooming, bathing, h ygiene, toi leting and cognition ) and instrumental activities of daily l iving (mea l preparation, house keeping, laundry, shopping, medication and oxygen management). Assistance ranges from several hours per week to 24 hours per day. Without these supports, more than 19,000 individuals would likely receive services in a more costl y nursi ng facility. Oregon provides a variety of in-home service options available to individuals based on preference, choice and cost-ef fectivene ss. Consumer -Employed Pro vider Program Individuals participating in this program receive services from home care w orkers. The in-home recipient is the employer and is empowered and responsible to hire, train, supervise, track hours worked, address perform ance deficiencies and discharge p roviders. Homecare workers are paid a set rate established through collective bargaining, which the State pa ys on the individual's behalf. The Oregon Home Care Commission establishes homecare worker enrollment sta ndards and training required, both o f which contribute to the quality of in-home services. APD 2023- 25 ways and Means Page |3 Oregon Department of Human Services Aging and People with Disabilities In-Home Services Program Unit F orm is forecast to serve approximately 20,000 individuals in this program in the 2021 - 2023 biennium. Independent Choices Program This program is a 1915(j) State Plan Opt ion and allows individuals to exercise more decision- making authority in identifyin g, accessi ng, man aging and purchasing goods and services that enhance independence, dignity, choice and well- being. This option is popular among individuals who wish to take complete control over the planning , budget and provision of services. In the Indepen dent Choices Program, the cost of the established service plan is \"cashed-out\" and deposited into the eligible individual's dedicated Independent Choices Program checkin g account. The individual then p ays providers directly based on a n individually negotiated r ate. Participants have the flexibility to use a portion of the funds to purchase goods that enhance their independence and are unavailable through the medic al plan, such as a wheelchair lift for a vehicle or a wheelchair ramp for their home. The state perf orms periodic monitoring with an emphasis on to ensure that the funds are used to meet the individual 's service needs and that funds are used a ppropriately . Specialized Living Services These services are designed to serve a specific special -need s consumer base, such as those w ith traumatic brain injuries or quadriplegia who woul d otherwise require 24-hour care. The services are provided through c ontracts with qu alified vendors who provide specialized, shared -attendant services to individuals living in their own homes or apartments. Cost Drivers The m ajor c ost drivers of the in-home services program are the current number of eligible individuals, their level of needed assistance, the length of time receiving services, and the growing populatio n of those requiring services. The population served is much diffe rent than it was 30 years ago when Oregon first received a waiver to allow in- home services . With the adva ncement of medical technology and treatment options, individuals are li ving longer with chronic disease and significant disabilities. Anothe r major cos t driver is the provi sion of wages and benefi ts for homecare workers tied to collective bargaining. This includes set 2023- 25 ways and Means Page |4 Oregon Department of Human Services Aging and People with Disabilities In-Home Services Program Unit F orm wages, paid time of f, workers' compensations premiums, unemployment insurance and other benefits. Program Justification and L ink to Focus Areas In-home services link to the Safer, Hea lthier Communities focus area. In the early 1980 s, Oregon was the first state awarded a Medicaid 1915(c) Home and Community -Base d Services waiver from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , which al lowed Oregon to serve individuals in their homes and communities. In 2013, Oregon added a new, 19 15(k) Sta te Plan Option , or \"K plan, \" that provides additional flexibility and f unds. In an independent study conducted by AARP, Oregon received an o verall ran king of 4th out of 50 states in terms of choice of settings and providers, quality of life and quality of care, and effective transitions f rom nursing facilities back into the c ommunity. Across the nation, Oregon continues to be a leader for serving indivi duals in their own homes. The program empowers individuals to direct their own services and make choices that enhance their quality of lif e, live with dignity, and remain as independent as possible . Health and safety are maintained through the pr ovision of necessary assistance with activities of d aily living and instrumental activities of daily l iving. Consist ent provision of services, inclu ding medication management and the preparation of nutritious meals, delays or diverts an individual's entry into more costly care settings. Program Performance A key goal of the Oregon Department of Human Services (ODHS ) is that people are safe and living as independently as possible. O DHS currently measures this goal based on the percentage of individuals living in their own ho mes in lieu of a licensed care facility, as well as the percentage of individuals who mo ve to a less restrictive service setting. Enabling Legislation/Program Au thorization Medicaid is an entitle ment program that was enacted in 1965 unde r Titl e XIX of the Social Security Act. Eligible individuals have the right to receive long- term care services in a nu rsing facility. While states are not required to pa rticipate in Medicaid, they must follow Medic aid rules to receive federal matching funds . Oregon's Long-Term Care system operates under a variety of Medicaid options 2023- 25 ways and Means Page |5 Oregon Department of Human Services Aging and People with Disabilities In-Home Services Program Unit F orm which allows long-term ca re services to be provided in home and community - based settings , more cost effective than the required nursing facilit y service. Funding Streams In-home services are funde d through the Medicaid program. The services are designed and appr oved using Medica id 1915 c Home and Com munity -Based Waiver s, and primarily, the Community First Choice Option in the Medica id State Plan. The program 1915c Waiver funding mat ch rate is current Federal Medical Assistance P ercentage (FMAP), 60.22 percent federal funds and 39.78 percent General Fu nd; for 1915K, the ra te is FMAP plus 6 percent (66.22 percent) federal funds and 32.78 percent General Fund. There is a small amount of funding from the estates of former recipients.

In 2019- 21 th e caseload began to decli ne because of COVID -19. Program Overview Nursing fa cility services are the institutional option availab le in Oregon's long- term care continuum, which also consist s of in-home and community- based care. Nursing facilities are generally considered the mo st restrictive setting of the three options offered ; however, this program is important for individuals with the highest levels of acuity and is a mandated federal benefit under the Medicaid program. Nursing facility services are the guaran teed benefit (entitlement) by federal law for individual who meet nursing facility level of care crit eria set by the state. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|2 Oregon Department of Human Services Aging and People with Disabilities Nursing Faci lities Program Unit Form Program Description Nursing facilities are most appropriate for people with high acuity needs requiring 24-hour medical oversight and a protective/structured setting. They offer short - term care for indi viduals who need rehabilitation servic es or 24-hour nursing. They may be appropriate for a limited number of individuals who need l ong-term care due to permanent health problems too complex or serious for in -home or comm unity -based care settings . Nursing facilit y rates cover basic, complex, pe diatric, enhanced care, and post - hospital extended care. Services vary in nursing care facilities, but generally consist of the following: Medical treatment prescribed by a docto r; Physical, speech, and o ccupationa l therapy; Assist ance with personal care acti vities such as eating, walking, bathing, and using the toilet (custodial care) ; and Social services. Oregon currently has 130 licensed nursing facilities . These facilities have approximately 2.26 million annual resident days, of which nearly 65.7 percent are Medicaid clients . The majority of residents are admitted directly from acute care hospitals with a very small percentage from home. Payer Long -Term Care - Nursing F acility Medicare 14.03 % Medicaid 70.81 Private Pay 15.16 % There ha s been a significant increase in the number and percenta ge of Medicaid consumers receiving services. As such, there has also been an increase in revenue coming from Medicai d in the l ast bienni um. It is now about 71% of NF r evenue compared to about 61% previous ly. The main cost drivers are low census in nursing facilities, the length of stay in a nursing facility, and the ste ady increase in the daily reimbursement rat e. The 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|3 Oregon Department of Human Services Aging and People with Disabilities Nursing Faci lities Program Unit Form nursing f acility reimbursement rate is tied to the provider assessment statute. The current nursing facility r eimbursement basic rate is $440.82 per resident pe r day . It includes a 5 p ercent increase provided during the pandemic. The provider assessment rate is $32.91 . In the 2021-2023 biennium, the prov ider assessment is expected to account for approximately $ 142.2 million of $3.6 billion in total APD program expenditures. Program Justification and Link to Focus Areas Nursing facility services link to the Saf er, Health ier Communities focus area. Thou gh nursing facility level of care is a guaranteed benefit, Oregon has bee n the national leader i n creating cost -effective alternatives that meet people's needs in their homes and other community settings, such as assisted l iving facilities, in- home care , retirement communities, reside ntial c are and adult foster homes. Oregon c ontinues to work closel y with individuals and their families to offer the full array of community- based services. The new State Plan Authori ty approve d by the Centers for Medicare and Med icaid Services in July 2013 prov ides Medicaid - funded resources to ass ist individuals in transitioning from nursing facilities. Nursing fac ilities are a n important service in our continuum , meeting the needs of some individuals with higher acuity level s; howeve r, ODHS still be lieves there are opport unities to decrease usage. Oregon continues to highlight, strengthen and encourage the use of community -based care facilities instead of nursing facilities. ODHS has established a g oal of decreasing the p ercentage of long- term care recipie nts utilizing nursing facility services to 10 percent . As of May 2020, the percentage of long-term care recipients utilizing nurs ing facilities services is 12.4 percent . Prog ram Perfor mance Nursing faci egulated by the f ederal governmen t and are licensed and routinely monitored by the s tate. The state establishes requirements fo r nursing facilities that promote quality of care and maximization of personal choice and independence for re sidents.

One-way performance is measured in this program is by the occ upancy percentage of nursing faciliti es. Oregon has one of the lowest occupancy percentages in the nation at 67.5 percent compared with the national average of 78 percent . Enab ling Legi slation/Program Authorization Medicaid is an entitlement program that w as enacted in 1965 under Tit le XIX of the Social Securit y Act. While states a re not requir ed to participate in Medicaid, in order to receive federal matching funds states m ust follow th e Medicaid rules. Oregon's l ong-term care system operates under Medicai d state plan autho rity.

The 2013 Legislative Assembly reauthorized the provider assessment t hrough 2020. Funding Streams Nursing facility services are funded through the Medicaid program; t herefore, the federal government pays 60.22 percent , Federal Medical Assistanc e Percentage (FMAP), with the balance being split between General Fund and provider taxes. There is also funding provided through the estate s of former recipients. When a Medicaid recipient passes away, the state is required by federal law to recover expen ditures for th e indi vidual's care from the recipient's estate.

In 2019, OAA funding helped serve nearly 213,000 Oregonians. Program Overview Services and supports available to individuals under the Older Americans Act (OAA) provide vital assistance designed to prevent or delay entry into Medicaid - funded long -term care such as i n-home o r 24-hour residential services. The OAA is a federal law that set out a national aging network structure consisting of the U.S. Administration on Aging (AoA , now part of the Administration for Com munity Living ), State Units on Aging ( ODHS/Aging and People with Disabilities program), and Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs). The OAA authorizes funding and services through this network to serve older individuals in their homes and communi ties, through local entities. All individuals aged 60 or older, regardless of income are eligible to receive services but the programs are targeted towards those in greatest social or economic need. A specific focus on how to better serve diverse populations of older adults across race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, veteran status and other intersecting categories are essential with the continually changing demographics of Oregon. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |2 Oregon Department of Human Services Aging and People with Disabilities Older Americans Act Program Unit Form Program Description Older Americans Act services are administered entirely by 16 local Area Agencies on Aging. To qualify for OAA supported services an individual must meet the following criteria: Be 60 years of age or older; Be a caregiver of someone 60 years of age or older (or younger if the person is diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease or related dementia) or an older relative caring for a child 18 year of age or younger or an individual with disabilities age 18 or older ; or Be 55 or older and have an adjusted income at or below 125 percent of Federal Poverty Level for the Senior Community Service Employment Program (Title V). Please Note : There is no income or asset/resource criteria for eligibility, except for the Senior Community Service Employment Program (Title V). The Older Americans Act authorizes services and funding by title Title III Supportive Services - Provides assistance to maintain independence through assisted transportation, information and referral/assistance, i n-home care, adult day care, chore services, home modification and other housing help, legal assistance, mental health outreach and assistive devices. Title III also partially funds Oregon's Aging and Disability Resource Connection (ADRC), which provides unbiased information, referral and options counseling for individuals (consumers, family members and caregivers) needing long -term services a nd supports. Nutrition Services - In order to reduce hunger and food insecurity and promote socialization, health and well- being, OAA authorizes both home - delivered (commonly known as Meals on Wheels) and congregate 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |3 Oregon Department of Human Services Aging and People with Disabilities Older Americans Act Program Unit Form (community setting, senior center, community center, etc.) meals programs. The act also requires nutrition education and counseling. Services Incentive Program (NSIP) - Supplements funding authorized under Title III for food used in meals served under the Older Americans Act. States receive an allocation based on the number of meals served under the OAA in the state , in proportion to the total number of meals served by all states. Preventive Health Services - Authorizes evidence -based programs that prom ote healthy lifestyles through physical activity, appropriate diet and nutrition, and self-management of chronic health conditions. National Family Caregiver Support Program - Provides individual and group options counseling, training and respite care for family members and friends who are primary caregivers to seniors. This program also provides support to older relatives and raising grandchildren. Title V Senior Community Se rvice Employment Program (SCSEP) - Authorizes a community service and work -based training program for older workers that provides subsidized, service -based training for low- income persons 55 or older who are unemployed and have poor employment prospects. Participants are paid minimum wage for approximately 20 hours per week while they develop valuable skills and connections to help them find and keep jobs in their communities. Title V funding is awarded to ODHS/APD from the U.S. Department of Labor and is c ompetitively sub- granted to a qualified job training organization. Title VII Elder Rights Services - Provides a focus on the physical, mental, emotional and financial well- being of older Americans. Services include pension counseling, legal assistance , and elder abuse prevention education. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |4 Oregon Department of Human Services Aging and People with Disabilities Older Americans Act Program Unit Form Ombudsman Program - Establishes an Office of the State Long -Term Care Ombudsman program to identify, investigate and resolve complaints made by or on behalf of residents of licensed care facilities (nursing homes, assisted living and adult foster homes) and promote system changes that will improve the quality of life and care for residents. The allocation for this program is 100 percent passed through to the Office of the Long -Term Care Ombudsman, a separate state agency from APD. OAA Funding - OAA funding is granted to each State Unit on Aging (ODHS/APD) based on a population formula. The State Unit on Aging sub - grants Title III fund s to Oregon's 16 designated Area Agencies on Aging (AAA) based on a state population formula. The AAAs work with their local communities to assess and develop a menu of services that meet the needs of older adults in their planning and service area. Subseq uently, the AAA submits an Area Plan to the State describing the delivery of OAA services in their communities; this is basis for the funding agreement between the AAA and ODHS/APD. Program Justification and Link to Focus Areas OAA program services contribute to the Safe r, Healthier Communities goal. The OAA, in partnership wit h providers and clients, provides vital support for older adults who are at significant risk of losing their independence by providing food, job training/opportunities, social support, transportation, chronic disease self - management and fall prevention. Annual State Program reports are submitted to the Administration on Community Living , consisting of service unit data and client demographics. Evidence -based programs supported by the preventive health services funding under Title III have provided an opportunity to demonstrate health care cost -saving based on the research supporting the programs. The Senior Community Service Employment Program t racks six performance measures each year inclu ding employment and retention. Performance standards and measures have recently been established for the Aging and Disability Resource Connections Program and will be tracked appropriately. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |5 Oregon Department of Human Services Aging and People with Disabilities Older Americans Act Program Unit Form Program Performan ce Number of people served/items produced OAA data reporting requires AAAs to capture identifiable unduplicated clients who receive \"registered services\" and an estimated number of clients receiv ing \"non-registered services.\" Registered services include personal care, home care, chore, meals, day care, case management, assisted transportation and nutrition counseling. Non -registered services include but are not limited to information and assistance, health promotion programs, group education, etc. The AAA s serve d approximately 85,822 distinct individuals in state fiscal year 2021 . Quality of the services provided Program standards have been established for the major services and annual program mon itoring is conducted. Timeliness of services provided The Family Caregiver Support Program of the OAA is the only service area that consistently encounters wait lists. Cost per service unit Varies depending on the level of community support, the OAA funding on average supports about one -third of th e cost of service. Further funding comes from local governments, donations, and fundraising. Enabling Legislation/Program Authorization Federal Law: 45 CFR, Part 1321. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |6 Oregon Department of Human Services Aging and People with Disabilities Older Americans Act Program Unit Form Funding Streams OAA funds are 100 percent federal. The law has a required Maintenance of Effort and state match of $5 million per biennium, which is met with state funding authorized for the Oregon Project Independence Program (ORS 410.410 to 410.480). OAA funding was never intended nor does it fully fund services. Each dollar of OAA funding is leveraged with $2 of state and local funds, participant donations, and community fundraising. Additionally, the services are enhanced with the in -kind support of volunteers, donated community space and equipment, etc. Funding Justification and Significant Changes to CSL N/A 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |1 Oregon Department of Human Services Aging and People with Disabilities Oregon Project Independence Program Unit Form Oregon Department of Human Services: Oregon Project Independence Primary Long -Term Focus Area: Safer, Healthier Communities Secondary Long -Term Focus Area : Program Contact: Nakeshia Knight -Coyle Program Overview Oregon Project Independence (OPI) provides preventive and in -home services and supports to a diverse population of eligible individuals to reduce the risk of out -of- home placement and promote self -determination. This program optimizes eligible individuals' personal and community support resources to prevent, or delay spend down to Medicaid -funded long -term care . 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |2 Oregon Department of Human Services Aging and People with Disabilities Oregon Project Independence Program Unit Form Program Description Oregon Project Independence (OPI) is a st ate-funded program offering in -home services and related supports to a diverse population in Oregon. ODHS/APD strives to deliver in -home services in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner. OPI provides essential services such as personal care, homecare and chore assistance, a dult day care, service coordination, registered nursing (teaching/delegation of nursing tasks to caregivers) , case management and home - delivered meals. This program complements services provided under the Older Americans Act. Traditionally, OPI has served individuals who are 60 years of age or older who are assessed as needing assistance with activities of daily living (eating, dressing/grooming, bathing/personal hygiene, mobility, elimination and cognition) and/or instrumental activities of daily l iving (housekeeping, shopping, transportation, medication management and meal preparation) a nd are not receiving Medicaid. Also, individuals under age 60 who have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease or a relat ed disorder are also eligible. The program was expanded by the 2005 Oregon Legislature to include younger adults with disabilities and recently $6 million to continue funding for a pilot program has been made available to support this limited expansion. In 2021, the Oregon Legislature passed legislation that allowed ODHS APD to apply for an 1115 Demonstration Waiver with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to begin to match OPI General Fund dollar s with federal Medicaid funds. In a collaborative process with community partners, APD developed and submitted the 1115 Waiver in November 2021. APD has been in negotiations with CMS since January 2022 and expects to implement in October 2022. This change will allow the state to increase the number of individuals served through OPI, and a family caregiver assistance program, while ma intaining the unique nature of the OPI program. In the traditional OPI program , there are neither income nor resource requirements for eligibility; however, these factors are taken into consideration when assessing the individual's risk of needing Medicai d long -term care. In the demonstration waiver , the waiver does have income and asset limits . OPI clients do not pay a charge for the service coord ination they receive. For traditional OPI, services other than service coordination are provided at no cost to families with net incomes at or 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |3 Oregon Department of Human Services Aging and People with Disabilities Oregon Project Independence Program Unit Form below 150 percent of the federal poverty l evel (FPL). Families with net incomes from 150 percent to 400 percent FPL pay a fee toward services using a sliding scale based on income. Families with net incomes at or above 400 percent FPL pay the full cost of the services provided ( other than service coordinati on). In the demonstration waiver, there will be no copayments or cost-sharing for eligible individuals. In part, this is because APD wants to ensure that as many people as possible access OPI through the demonstration waiver rather than the state general funded program. Oregon Project Independence services are delivered statewide through the network of 16 designated Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs). Administrative cost efficiencies have been realized in one area of the state where neighboring AAAs collaborated to jointly secure contr acted services of a single in- home care agency. AAAs share these types of inn ovations and strategies. In the waiver, in areas served by local APD offices, the APD office will determine eligibility, and ongoing case management will be performed by the AAA. Program Justification and Link to Focus Areas OPI contributes to the Safer, Healthier Communities focus area, and its desired outcome is to \"decrease the number of older Oregonians that access full Medicaid - funded health and long-term care system .\" AAAs are currently maintaining waiting lists of indiv iduals who are eligible to be served by OPI. The demonstration waiver should eliminate any waitlists allowing the state to serve more than twice the current number of people . OPI and the new demonstration program s empower individuals to direct their own services and make choices that enhance their quality of life, live with dignity and remain as independent as possible. Health is maintained through the provisio n of necessary assistance with activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily l iving. Program Performance APD recently conducted an analysis of the Return on Investment (ROI) for OPI. Nationally recognized researchers estimated that the estimate of OPI's ROI is 3.8 to 1. For fiscal year 2016- 17, they estimated that, at a minimum , benefits totaled $49.4 million and came at a cost of $13.0 million. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |4 Oregon Department of Human Services Aging and People with Disabilities Oregon Project Independence Program Unit Form Data on number of individuals accessing OPI over the last 20 years : Biennium Number of unique consumers 2001 - 2003 4,415 2003 - 2005 2,939 2005 - 2007 3,637 2007 - 2009 3,414 2009 - 2011 2,278 2011 - 2013 2,455 2013 - 2015 5,250 2015 - 2017 2021* 3,213 *2019- 2021 OPI unique consumers as of June 30, 2020 The number of unduplicated consumers decreased in 2019- 2021 due to COVID impact on LTSS and rising costs associated with homecare worker and in -home care agency rates. Quality of the services provided Personal and home -care services are delivered via licensed in -home care agencies or registered home care workers. Quality of care standards for in -home care agencies are set forth in licensing rules found in OAR Chapter 333, Division 536; compliance with licensing standards is monitored by the Health Care Licensing and Certification unit of the Public Health Division. Home care Workers who provide services to OPI clients are required to be registered with the Oregon Home Care Commission and receive background checks and ongoing training. Enabling Legislation/Program Authorization OPI is authorized under Oregon law at ORS 410.410 to 410.480. Funding Streams Currently, OPI is funded by the s tate Genera l Fund. Services are expanded through the utilization of program income generated from client cost sharing based on a sliding fee schedule. Once the 1115 Medicaid Demonstration Waiver is approved 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |5 Oregon Department of Human Services Aging and People with Disabilities Oregon Project Independence Program Unit Form by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) , the program funding stream will expand to include federal dollars. OPI General Funds serve as the required Maintenance of Effort (45 CFR Sec. 1321.49) and state match (45 CFR Sec. 1321.47) to receive federal funding under the Older Americans Act. At least $5 million per biennium in state funds is needed to maintain the Mainte nance of Effort and match requirements of the OAA. The intent is that the $5 million remains outside of the Demonstration Waiver to serve individuals who cannot meet the new criteria and to maintain the MOE requirement. Funding Justification, And Significant Changes to CSL N/A 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |1 Oregon D epartment of Human Services Aging and Peopl e wit h Disabilities Ot her Services Prog ram Unit Form Oregon Department of Human Services: Other Services Primary Long -Term Focus Area: Safer, Healthier Communities Secondary Long -Term Focus Area: Program Contact: Nakeshia Knight -Coyl e Costs for 2009- 2011 and 2011- 2013 are h igher due to the transfer of the funding for Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B buy -in programs from the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) to Aging and People with Disabilities (APD) . The se funding sources wer e transferred back to OHA in 2013- 2015, but APD co ntinue s to administer the programs. Program Overview The Other Services category is dominated by federally mandated programs, such as the Medicare Buy -in and the Medicare Part D low -income subsidy programs, which help low -income Medicare benef iciaries meet th eir cost sharing requirements. This cost -effective investment ensures that Medicare remains in a first-payer position, thereby reducing or eliminating costs to the state's Medicaid health programs (Ore gon Health Plan). Other s ervices a lso include programs t hat support individuals living as independently as possible in the community. For example, home -delivered meals provide a critical support to many individuals who otherwise may not be able to remain i ndependent in their own home . 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |2 Oregon D epartment of Human Services Aging and Peopl e wit h Disabilities Ot her Services Prog ram Unit Form Program Description Federal l aw requires states to provide payments for Medicare beneficiaries who meet specific income guidelines. APD helps consumers access this benefit. Medicare beneficia ries include individuals aged 65 or olde r and people with disabilities w ho have been receiving Social Secu rity Disability payments for at least two years. The passage of the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act (MIPPA) of 2008 expanded the asset allowance and eliminate d the estate recove ry compone nt of Medicare Savings Programs. The se changes eliminated many of the barriers to the Medicare buy- in programs for a significant number of Oregonians. Oregon is expected to serve more than 180,000 older adults and people with disabiliti es in the fo llowi ng pr ograms: State Medicare buy -in: By p urchasing M edicare Part B (which has a federally required premium) for individuals eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid (dual -eligibles), the M edicaid pr ogram pays for medic al services (such as p hysician, radiology and laborat ory services) only after Me dicare has paid as primary payer. Medicare savings programs: Clients in these programs receive federal ly mandated assistance with their Medicare Part B premiums. Specified lo w- income Medic are be neficiaries a nd qu alified individu als are those individuals who have income between 100 percent and 135 percent of the federal poverty level. Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries: Beneficiaries receive state assistance for the costs asso ciated with the Medic are hospital bene fit, Part A, and physician services, Part B , that woul d otherwise be required of them - including premiums, deductibles and co -payments. These clients have income equal to or less than 100 p ercent of the federal poverty level. Medica re Part D: Medicar e Part D i s the Me dicare pharmacy benefit. All clients in the Medicare buy -in programs receive assistance from CMS with their Medicare Part D premiums and co- insurance amounts. Oregon pays a per-person monthly premium to M edicare for eli gible cl ients. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |3 Oregon D epartment of Human Services Aging and Peopl e wit h Disabilities Ot her Services Prog ram Unit Form Along with mandated programs, APD works to provide services that support indivi duals in their own ho me. These supports r educe reliance on nursing fa cilities and licensed community- based care while simultaneously improving qualit y of life and savin g taxpayers ' money. These pro grams provide supplemental services as needed to in -home clients and a re not tracked as a separate c aseload. These programs inclu de: Medicaid Adult Day Services: Adult d ay services provide supervision for adults with function al or cogni tive impairments wh o cannot be left alone for significant periods of time . Services may be provided for half or full days in stand-alone centers, hospitals, senior centers and licensed ca re facilities. Medicaid Home -Deliver ed Meals : Hom e-delivered meal s are provided for Medicaid eligible clients receiving in -home services who a re homebound and unable to go to the congregate meal sites , such as se nior centers, for meals. These programs ge nerally provide a daily hot mid- day m eal and of ten froze n meals for days of the week be yond the provider's delivery schedule. Cash payments : APD makes special -needs payments to reduce the need for more expensive long -term care payments and to allow a client to retain independence and mobili ty in a sa fe environ ment . Spec ial needs payments may be used for such things as adapting a home's stairs in to a ramp o r repairing a broken furnace. Clients can also receive cash payments to help pay Medicare Part D prescription drug copays, payments for no n-medical transport ation and a one-time emergency p ayment for an unexpected loss (such as stolen cash, a c ar repair or a broken appliance). The bud get supporting these payments meets the federal requirement for APD's maintenance of effort (MOE ). Program Justifica tion and Link to Focu s Areas Other Service s are targeted supports that help Oregonians remain in t he least restrictive setting possible. ODHS strives to provi de services in a respectful, culturally, and ling uistically appropriate manner. These services tie to Strategy 1 on changing how health care is delivered in Oregon by supp orting efforts t o increase home - and community- based care to 90 percent of the total M edicaid long-term care caseload. The Safer , Healthier Communities focus area also envisions a n integrated sys tem that these community suppo rts will help realize. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |4 Oregon D epartment of Human Services Aging and Peopl e wit h Disabilities Ot her Services Prog ram Unit Form These services allow i ndividuals to receive services at the rig ht time and in the right plac e. They maximize expenditures by using the federal portion of Medicaid funding to provide per son-centered ser vices when the person needs them. It ties directly to the desired outcome of Ensuring Fi nancial Stability for the Long- Term Care Service Systems an d Supports. Other Services complement and enhance in-home service plans, cont ributing to overall cost-effect iveness and the sustainability of the plan. Other services not only have a positive impa ct on consumers , but also their natural support system (relatives/friends/neighbo rs), preventing burn out and the need for higher cost services. Program Performan ce In an independent study conducted by AARP in 201 7, Oregon received an overall ranking of 4th out of 50 states in terms of choice of settings and provi ders, quality of life, quality of care and effective transitions from nursing facilities bac k into the community. With approximately 5 2 percent of the Medicaid caseload served in their own home s, Oregon c ontinues to rank in t he highest percentile. Enabl ing Legislation/Program Authorization Services in this category are operated un der both the M edicaid state plan optio ns, including the \"K plan\" and Oregon's Home and Commun ity Based Care 1915(c) waiver. The state provides services that \"waive\" against nurs ing facility services, the mandated entitlement for Medicaid eligible individu als under Title XIX of the Social Secur ity Act. Additionally, ORS 410 and ORS 443 provide statutory policy and struct ure to the services offered. Funding Streams Other services are mostly funded through the Medicaid pro gram; t herefore, the federal governm ent pays approx imately 60.22 percent and the General Fund covers 39.78 percent . There is a small amount of funding that is state general fund only, which serves to meet the state's maint enance of effort requirements. Finally, there is a small amount of funding from the estates of former recipi ents. When a Medicaid recipient passes a way, the state is required by federal law to recover 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |5 Oregon D epartment of Human Services Aging and Peopl e wit h Disabilities Ot her Services Prog ram Unit Form money spent for the individual's care from the recipient's estate. These funds are reinvested in service s for other individuals, offsetting t he need for genera l funds. Funding Justificatio n and Significant Changes to 23 -25 CSL Due to the timing of the release of GB, details lower than Division level were not available . 2023-25 Ways and Means Page |1 Oregon Department of Human Services Office of Developmental Disabilities Services Program Narrative Oregon Department of Human Services Office of Developmental Disabilities Services Program mission The Office of Developmental Disabilities Services (ODDS) provides support across the lifespan to Oregonians. ODDS, partners, and the developmental disabilities community come together to provide services, supports and advocacy to empower Oregonians with intellectual and developmental disabilities to live full l ives in their communities. Program vision People and families access quality supports that are simple to use and responsive to their strengths, needs and choices, while they live and thrive as valued members of their community. Program values ODDS fulfills its mission and carries out its responsibilities while adhering to the following values: Choice, self -determination and person-centered practices Children and families together Health, safety and respect Community inclusion and community living Strong relationships Service equity and access ODDS worked with a diverse group of partners representing all areas of the intellectual/ developmental disabilities (I/DD) service delivery system to develop a strategic plan that will guide i ts work for the next biennium and beyond. The mission , vision and goals included here reflect that effort and plan. The strategic planning process resulted in a firm understanding that the person, their family and the goals they want to achieve remain at the core of our system. As a result of this process, the agency also committed to develop a 2023-25 Ways and Means Page |2 Oregon Department of Human Services Office of Developmental Disabilities Services Program Narrative Service Equity Plan that includes reach ing out to underserved populations, remov ing barriers to access and providing services by staff who have appropriate cultural and linguistic capacities. ODDS seeks to achieve the following strategic goals: Create a system that is sustainable and easy to use with effective communication and equitable access. Honor and support people to make their own choices about who they want to be and what they want to do in their lives. Support equal opportunity for living options and meaningful employment in an integrated community setting. Provide families the amount and type of supports they need to raise their children at home, or when necessary, in another family home within their community. Support health and safety while people live rich, full lives. People serve d ODDS serves people with intellectual disabilities (IQ 75 or below) or developmental disabilities such as autism, Down syndrome and cerebral palsy. These disabilities are lifelong and have a significant impact on a person's ability to function independently. Some people with I/DD may also have significant medical or mental health needs. Most people with I/DD meet Medicaid financial eligibility requirements. Community First Choice Option services The I/DD service system i s composed of three basic components: program design, program delivery and program services that are primarily offered through the Affordable Care Act's Community First Choice Option (CFCO). Under CFCO, eligible persons must receive a functional needs assessment that informs the planning process. They also participate in a person -centered planning process that focuses on the person's strengths, community engagement, personal goals and outcomes. Th e planning process results in an annual I ndividual Support Plan (ISP) that documents the services the person will access in order to meet their goals. Together, the functional needs assessment and the ISP inform the amount of and/or rate for services that are available to the person. 2023-25 Ways and Means Page |3 Oregon Department of Human Services Office of Developmental Disabilities Services Program Narrative Program services ODDS offers a broad array of services to optimize choice and offer s cost-effect ive supports based on functional need. Attendant care Attendant care provides support for people to perform activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living (ADL/IADL). This is the primary service available to people with I/DD through CFCO . Attendant care services are generally categorized based on the setting where the person lives. Services that now fall under attendant care include: In-home supports for children and adults Children's Intensive In-Home Services (CIIS) 24-hour services: Group home for children and adults Adult and child foster care Supported living (adults only) Day services Stabilization and Crisis Unit (SACU) In-home supports for children and adults These services are designed to provide ADL/IADL supports in the home or in the community. Children who receive these supports live with family, and adults live either with family or in their own home. In -home services are provided to the majority of individuals served by ODDS . Without these services, many individuals would require much more expensive out- of-home services such as group or foster homes. Persons who live in their own home or with their family can access a ran ge of services needed to successfully support these individuals. These services may include professional behavior services, assistive technology, or environmental modifications . For both children and adults, in- home services are provided by Personal Supp ort Workers (PSWs) or by Direct Support Professionals (DSPs) who are affiliated with Medicaid -certified provider agencies. PSWs are hired directly by the person 2023-25 Ways and Means Page |4 Oregon Department of Human Services Office of Developmental Disabilities Services Program Narrative receiving services or by their employer representative. DSPs are employees of private organizations who contract with the state to provide services. Children's Intensive In- Home Services (CIIS) These services consist of three model waiver programs that provide intensive supports to children living in the family home : The first program is for children with significant behavioral issues who, without supports, would require specialized out -of-home services. The second program is for children with medical conditions who, without supports, would require nursing facility services. The third program is for children with intense medical needs. These children are dependent on life support technology such as ventilators that, without these in -home services, would require a hospital setting. With the implementation of the Community First Choice Option, children who do not have the intensive needs described above can access in- home support services through their local Community Developmental Disabilities Programs (CDDP) upon completion of a needs assessment and an Individual ized Support Plan (ISP). 24-hour services 24-hour services are for children and adults who can no longer remain at home or adults who choose to receive services in a 24 -hour setting such as a group home, foster home , or supported living service . These services are provided in settings outside the family home with the exception of supported living . Group home and supported living services are provided by private organizations that contract with the state. Child foster care providers are private providers licensed through either ODHS Child Welfare or their local Community Developmental Disabilities Programs. Adult foster care providers are represented by the Service Employees International Union. In all of these settings, a diverse workforce and t he ability to provide linguistically and culturally appropriate services are critical to removing barriers to service access. People usually receive 24 -hour services when they are unable to stay at home on their own or with their family. This may be due t o their own needs or the 2023-25 Ways and Means Page |5 Oregon Department of Human Services Office of Developmental Disabilities Services Program Narrative caregiver's ability to continue providing services. Children with disabilities enter 24- hour comprehensive services as a voluntary placement when the intensive needs of the child cannot be met in the family home . Involuntary place ments can also be made through Child Welfare action. In these cases, Child Welfare maintains responsibility for the court relationship , but I/DD provides the specific disability -related care. Day Services Day services are available for people who are ove r 18 and out of school. Many adults receiving 24- hour services also receive day services. These services are available for up to 25 hours a week for out -of-home activities, including employment -related activities. Adults receiving in-home supports are also able to receive day services as part of their attendant care. Day support activities that fall under the category of attendant care are provided through CFCO and provide supports promoting integration, independence and participation in the person's commun ity. Stabilization and Crisis Unit (SACU) SACU is a 24- hour service provided under the CFCO. SACU provides a safety net for Oregon's vulnerable individuals with I/DD who have the most intense medical and behavioral challenges. SACU provides services when no other community -based option is available for a person. This includes persons with I/DD coming out of the Oregon State Hospital or corrections systems, a s well as those from crisis situations where counties and private providers cannot mee t the needs of the person to ensure health and safety. SACU focuses on supporting people in community -based settings and enabling them to return to less intensive service levels as quickly as possible. SACU provides 24- hour residential, and day supports to people with I/DD from across the state who have significant medical or behavioral needs. The services are provided in licensed five -bed group homes. In 1987, Oregon began to move people with developmental disabilities who were living at the state institution (Fairview Training Center and Eastern Oregon Training Center) to private providers. SACU was established to serve the small number of people with complex medical or behavioral needs who could not yet 2023-25 Ways and Means Page |6 Oregon Department of Human Services Office of Developmental Disabilities Services Program Narrative be supported by private provide rs. Today, the profile of th ose SACU serves has changed as private agencies increase their skills to meet challenging needs and agree to provide needed services. While the population SACU initially served included a relatively high number of people with autism diagnoses , today's intensive support needs are more related to co -occurring mental health diagnosis and/or personality disorders. Transportation Non-medical transportation is also provided to help persons with I/DD in in- home and 24- hour services w hen public transportation is either not available or not feasible, to help them participate in employment or other services. Ancillary services In addition, people with I/DD served through ODDS are able to access vital ancillary services including: Professional behavioral services Assistive devic es Assistive technology Environmental modifications Long -term care community nursing Specialized nursing Employment First policy This policy states that employment in fully integrated work settings will be the first and priority option explored in service planning for all working- age adults and students preparing to transition to the world of work. Th e policy is based on the general philosophy that persons with I/DD have the ability, with the right supports, to be productive and contributing members of their communities through work. It also recognizes intrinsic and financial benefits of paid work to persons with I/DD and their famil ies. In alignment with this policy, ODDS stopped funding services in a Sheltered Workshop setting in September 2020. Additionally, ODDS has continued to support and implement SB 494 passed in 2019 to phase out subminimum wage by 2023-25 Ways and Means Page |7 Oregon Department of Human Services Office of Developmental Disabilities Services Program Narrative 2023. Further, ODDS conti nues to work with stakeholders to ensure that people with I /DD have access to employment supports and services, and we continue to track and report progress made in ensuring people with I /DD (including those who had been in Sheltered Work or who are transition age) are accessing Competitive Integrated Employment. Employment services Employment services have been strengthened and improved as part of the Employment First initiative. ODDS has restructured these services to encourage integrated, competitively paid employment for people with I/DD. Employment services are not offered through the CFCO ; they remain available through the Medicaid waiver s. Employment services include: Employment path identification Job discovery Job development Job coaching Small group supported employment Family support services These services are available to any family with a child with I/DD who is under age 18 and is not eligible for Medicaid. The program offers minimal support services with the most common request being for respite care. All children in this program have case managers through their county CDDP and state-funded services are allocated based on need. Most participating children are also in school programs and the case manager coordinates between school and home. Family support services can be more cost effective by allowing the family to support the child with a small amount of funding, without accessing Medicaid. Family -to-family networks These family -driven networks provide training, information, referral and general support with families providing support among one another. Just having another family to connect with or problem solve with is often what it takes to be 2023-25 Ways and Means Page |8 Oregon Department of Human Services Office of Developmental Disabilities Services Program Narrative supported in the family home. Program design and delivery ODDS programs are supported by central office staff and services. Central operations provid e strategic planning, program funding, policy development, service equity initiatives, general oversight and technical support to community services a s well as support and leadership for various advisory councils. The structure for service delivery and design includes a central program administration office within ODHS and contracted services with Community Developmental Disabilities Programs (CDD Ps) and brokerages. Contracted CDDPs, often operated by county governments , are responsible for eligibility determination and redeterminations, protective service investigations, and foster care licensing and reviews. After eligibility is established through the CDDP, adults who live in in -home settings can choose to be served by the CDDP or by a b rokerage. Brokerages provide case management services, including assessment and service planning for adults in-home. Case Management These services are provided through certified entities called brokerages or through CDDPs. CDDPs support children and adults while brokerages support adults in in- home settings. A functional needs assessment is administered to determine the person's level of need and the amount or rate of services that will be available. The services coordinator (SC) or personal agent (PA) then works with the person, family, and others important in the person's life to complete an Individual Sup port Plan (ISP) and a Career Development Plan (CDP). They then work with the person to identify necessary supports required to meet the needs identified through the assessment and the goals identified in the ISP/CDP. SCs and PAs provide referral s to provid ers and other resources necessary to meet the person's needs. SCs and PAs continuously monitor the individual's ISP implementation, their satisfaction with services and supports, and the plan and services in place to ensure the person's health and safety. 2023-25 Ways and Means Page |9 Oregon Department of Human Services Office of Developmental Disabilities Services Program Narrative Quality Improvement In 2017, ODDS created a Quality Improvement unit. This unit is responsible for coordinating quality assurance and quality improvement for I/DD services, including: Regular quality reviews of b rokerages and CDDPs. Oversight of licens ing activities. Coordinating with abuse investigator specialists (AIS s) and the Office of Training, Investigations and Safety (OTIS ). Establishing quality metrics for I/DD programs ; and Collecting and analyzing data to measure overall system performance and to inform policy decisions. Brokerages and Community Developmental Disabilities Programs (CDDP) field reviews The Quality Improvement unit conducts field reviews on a two -year cycle in each CDDP and brokerage. The reviews are focused on e nsuring Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Assurances are met through performance measures approved by CMS. The reviews assist I/DD in identifying program -specific strengths and areas requiring improvement and inform the t raining and technica l assistance we provide to individual CDDPs and brokerages. The reviews also facilitate the identification of common trends across the state that may suggest a need for system changes, improvements, best practices implementation and training. I/DD Licensi ng unit The Intellectual/Developmental Disabilities (I/DD) Licensing unit oversees a statewide program responsible for licensing and the quality of care in programs serving persons with I/DD, including the licensing of adult foster homes and 24- hour residential facilities. It oversees and is responsible for the Medicaid -agency certification of agencies and the endorsement of 24- hour residential programs, supported living programs, community living supports, direct nursing supports, professional behavior services, employment services and host homes. It also certifies support service brokerages and c hild foster homes throughout the state. Through licensing and certification, the I/DD licensing team ensures that providers of services comply with requireme nts for federal and state reimbursement. The I/DD Licensing unit also conducts complaint investigations 2023-25 Ways and Means Page |10 Oregon Department of Human Services Office of Developmental Disabilities Services Program Narrative and determines necessary corrective action up to and including civil penalties or revocation of a license or certificate. History and future trends Oregon is recognized nationally as an innovative leader in developing community -based services for persons with I/DD. Oregon is one of the few states that have no state - or privately- operated , institutional -level services specifically for people with devel opmental disabilities. In fact, the majority of persons wit h developmental disabilities in Oregon are served in their own home or their family's home. The work of ODDS and its partners and stakeholders aims to achieve a self - directed, family -involved, individually focused, culturally appropriate , and sustainable approach to service. According to the 2020 -21 National Core Indicator s' National Adult Family Survey Report and National Child Family Survey Report , people with I/DD and their families report high levels of satisfaction with services when they have increased control, the ability to integrate into their home communities more fully, and the benefits of home and community life. Ongoing input from our partners both nationally and in Oregon indicates that the number of people with I/DD-related needs is growing. There also is an increase in the number of people who need services that have co- occurring mental health needs or are comi ng from the corrections system. Efforts to ensure the long-term sustainability of ODDS programs and services will be essential in meet ing these growing needs. To reach underserved and underrepresented communities, moreover, ODDS must continue its efforts to build a diverse workforce capable of delivering linguistic ally and culturally agile services. Before COVID -19, the Direct Support Professional (DSP) workforce was in crisis with a national staffing shortage. COVID -19 made the situation worse . ODDS too k numerous measures to recruit and retain workers throughout the pandemic, including rate increases for care workers and provider agencies, retention incentives, incentives for new care workers, and a recruitment campaign involving the launch of the Impact Oregon website . ODDS expects these workforce shortages to continue after the pandemic and will continue its effort s to increase this vital workforce. 2023-25 Ways and Means Page |11 Oregon Department of Human Services Office of Developmental Disabilities Services Program Narrative In 2021, the Oregon L egislature fu nded HB 3352, formerly called Cover All People and renamed Healthier Oregon, to ensure that more Oregonians can access comprehensive Oregon Health Plan benefits, including long- term services and supports. This program will allow I/DD eligible individuals, regardless of immigration status, to access needed home - and community- based services. 2023- 25 Ways and Mean s Page |1 Oreg on Department of Human Servi ces I ntellectual and Develop mental Disabil ities Program Serv ices Program Unit F orm Oregon Department of Human Services: Program Services Primary Long -Term Focus Area: Safer and Healthier Communities Secondary Long -Term Focus Area: Program Contact: Anna Lansky Program Services - Caseload and Funding Note: Effective 2013 -2015, K Plan increased enrollment as well as lifted spending caps. Program Overview Oregon home and community -based services for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities are provided under several Medicaid author ities including Community First C hoice Option (CFCO), also known as K Plan , and five 1915 (c) waiver programs . ODDS also operate s a small Family Support program funded by state General Funds providing limited flexible supports for individuals and familie s. 2023- 25 Ways and Mean s Page |2 Oreg on Department of Human Servi ces I ntellectual and Develop mental Disabil ities Program Serv ices Program Unit F orm Curre ntly, ODDS home and community -based serv ices support more than 32,000 adults and children with intellectual and developmental disabilities to live their lives in their communities. More than 18 ,000 of the se individuals receive ser vices in their ow n of family homes. Program Description Oregon home and community -based services for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities are provided under several Medicaid authorities including Community First Choic e Option (CFCO), also known as K Plan, and five 1915 (c) waiver programs. Supports provided under K Plan are services such as attendant services that support individuals in accomplishing activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily li ving (ADL /IADL ), reli ef care, behavioral support services, t ransportation, environmental modifications and assistive technology and devices. The Adult and Children Waiver s provide services such as case management, employment servic es and other ancillary se rvice s (direct nu rsing s ervices, specia lized medical sup plies, environmental safety and vehicle modifications, and family training ). Services through the Children's Waiver are provided to children in all settings, including family homes, group homes, host homes and foster care through Co mmu nity Developmental Disabilities Programs (CDDPs). Services through the Adult Waiver are provi ded to adults, age 18 and older . Adults receiving service through CDDPs may reside in all settings including their own homes, f amily home s, supportive liv ing, grou p homes, and foster care. Adult s served through Support Services Brokerages receive services in their own or family home. Individuals receiving services through either waiver can access all K Plan services. Under CFCO, a n individu al can elect to live in any setting of their choice, but it may impact whether they receive case management support through a CDDP or B rokerage. Of the more than 3 2,000 individuals enrolled in services (May 2022 Variance Report) , 3,235 live in 24 -hour grou homes, 3,229 in foster homes and 763 in supporte d living. 18,042 individuals who receive I/DD services in addition to case management reside in their own or family homes. 7,469 of the adults served at home receive case management support throu gh Support Se rvices Brokerage s; 14,849 adults living in all settings receive case ma nagemen t through the CDDP syste m. In-home support services average approximately $4,065 per month per 2023- 25 Ways and Mean s Page |3 Oreg on Department of Human Servi ces I ntellectual and Develop mental Disabil ities Program Serv ices Program Unit F orm individual while out- of-home serv ices average approximately $10,202 per month. For both children and adult s, the direct c are services are p rovided through Personal Support Workers (PSWs), provider agencies, behavior consultants and respite providers. Perso nal Support Workers were provided collective bargaining rights in 2010 through HB 3618. Employment ser vices ODDS cur rently offer supp orted employment services , such as j ob development, job c oaching , supported small -group employment , Discovery and Empl oyment Path. Discovery and Employment Path help individuals explor e and learn skills to help them gain c ompeti tive integrated employment. These services are currently provided though all five waivers. People who are employed in the community have the highest level of integrat ion and have stronger social networks. The more people with developm ental disabi lities can achieve paid employm ent, the less d ependence there is on public resources and the greater the state's flexibility in designing future services that respond to the ne eds of this population. Oregon has been very successful in developin g community -based care to move away from in stitutions as a model of care. I ndividuals with developmental disabilities fully engaging with their communities brings positive outcomes while being fiscally beneficial. Based on feder al requirements, co mmuni ty emplo yment services will be the only employm ent services to receive federal funding as of September 1, 2020 . Model Waivers ODDS administer three Model Waiv ers through the Children's Intensive In- Home Services (CIIS) unit: Medic ally Involved Children 's Waiver , Medically Fragile Model Waiver and Behavioral Model Waiver for children. Current ly, these waivers serve about 376 kids. Children receiving service through Model Waivers are also able to a ccess K Plan services. Th ese ser vices are substa ntially the s ame as individu als served through the Comp rehensive and Support Services Waivers, including attendant services, relief care, behavioral support services, environmental modifications and assistive technology and devices . 2023- 25 Ways and Mean s Page |4 Oreg on Department of Human Servi ces I ntellectual and Develop mental Disabil ities Program Serv ices Program Unit F orm Family S upport Progra m Limited supports for children are offered by ODDS through the Family Support Program and are available to any family of a child under age 18 who is not receiving K plan or waiver services. T he program is funded by General Fund and offers flexible suppor ts with the m ost common request being for attendant ca re and respite services. On average , during 20 19-21 biennium, the program served 12 families per month at an average monthly cost of ab out $223 . All children in these programs have case managers through their count y Community Developmen tal Disabilities Program (CDDP). Program Justification and ODHS Equity North Star ODDS service and s upports focus on individu als with intelle ctual/developmen tal disabilities (I/DD) to ensure they are healthy , have the best possible qua lity of life in their commu nities among families and friends and are work ing or atte nding school to achieve the ir greatest potential. The service equity focus of I/DD service delivery system reflects the ODHS Equity North Star pillar: \"staff and communities will know s ervices and supports are w orking when all who live in Oregon, regardless of identity or place , can achieve well-being\". This is being achieved th rough investments into the direct workforce, development of robust and diverse network of provide rs including c ulturally specific provide rs, improved language access, building cultural agility a nd ensuring that indiv iduals' goals and preferences are respe cted and supported in the cont ext of their communities, families and culture . ODDS continuously works to ensure tha t service s are provided in a linguistically and culturally competent ma nner. I/DD services and supports not only connect individuals and f amilies to needed home and co mmun ity-based services , but also link them to resources critical to the social determina nts of health, such as housing, food and employment , through other governmental and comm unity resources . When compared to the entire Medicaid pop ulation, adults in the Med icaid-funded home and communit y-based services with I/DD are uniquel y more reliant on the service system to make lifestyle changes and to adequately access health care. Fund ing I/DD programs to support the necessary life style choices that reliably and con sistently follow through with m edical recom mendations will result in s ignificant cost sa vings t o the state's 2023- 25 Ways and Mean s Page |5 Oreg on Department of Human Servi ces I ntellectual and Develop mental Disabil ities Program Serv ices Program Unit F orm medical programs. Families and case managers are critical to help with hea lth care coordination in the communica tion and implementation of tre atmen t. I/DD services are critical to the financial stability of a famil y and to the pers on with i ntellectual/developmental disabilities. With supports, families are not forced to decide between working and s upporting their family member. It is also impo rtant that working -age adults with developm ental disab ilities are supporte d to work. Oregon has implemented an Employment First policy. This prioritizes individuals in actively en gaging in developing work skills and defining wo rk interest s, pursuing job de velopm ent or being employed in the c ommunit y, and receiving support to mai ntain employment . In addi tion to being happier and healthier, indi viduals with I/DD who are employed bro aden thei r network of supports . Important equity milestone s will be achieved i n July 2023 by opening I/DD services to all eligible individuals r egardless of their immi gration status in the United State s, pending legislative approval for funding . Effective January 1, 201 8, Senate Bill 558 - also known as Cover All Kids - made the Oregon Health Plan (OHP) available to more children and teens yo unger than 19, re gardless of immigration status. This coverage did not include long term services and supp orts at the time . In 2021, the Oregon Legislature passed House Bill 3352, formerly called Cover All People and renamed \"Healthier Oregon,\" to ensure more Oreg on adults ca n access comprehe nsive Oregon Health Plan benefits, including long term services and supports. The program will be phased in by enrolling people aged 19- 25 and 55 and older into program starting July 1, 2022 and opening up I/DD home - and communi ty-based services to all ages in July of 2023. This effort directly reflects ODHS Equity No rth Star pillar : \"We are de dicated to mak ing services, supports and well-being accessible to al l\". Program Performance Supporting i ndividuals to live at home or l ive on their own is the most desirable outcome f or people with I/DD and is most cost eff ectiv e for the state. The number of people supported at home has been the largest area of growth in the I/DD system. 2023- 25 Ways and Mean s Page |6 Oreg on Department of Human Servi ces I ntellectual and Develop mental Disabil ities Program Serv ices Program ough 430.695 enable the provision of fami ly support for children with developmental disabilities.

Program Overview The Stabilization and Crisis Unit (SACU ) is a safety net resource for Oregon ians with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD) who have no other option for a residential bed due to si gnificant I/DD and mental health challenges. SACU serves the most vulnerable, intensive, behaviorally and medically challenged individuals with I/DD . This includes people with developmental disabilities coming out of crisis situations, including hospitals, correctional systems or private providers where current supports cannot meet the needs of the individual and ensure their health and safety.

This program is an integral part of the overall I/DD continuum of services. SACU focuses on supporting people in community -based settings and preparing them to return to less intensive service levels once stabilized. Program Description SACU provides 24- hour residential services to individuals with I/DD who have significant behavioral, mental health or medical care needs. The services are provided in licensed four- and five-bed group homes located across six counties from the Portland metropolitan area to Eugene. As individuals enter SACU, staff work with each person to modify behaviors a nd increase individual skills. Many of the individuals supported have challenging behaviors that are frequent and intense , and staff may provide physical interventions as trained through the Oregon Intervention System (OIS ). All individual s have focused behavioral protocols that require frequent staff training and a high level of data collection and review. The program utilize s a person- centered approach where services are specifically tailored to the individual's needs, and it complies with all state and federal regulations. There is an active referral list of adults and children waiting to enter SACU. Before entry into SACU, in dividuals are first referred by the local Community Developmental Disabilities Program to community -based providers across the state. When a person is denied or terminated from a current provider program , they move to a SACU placement. Nearly all individua ls served have co-morbid (co- occurring) disorders of mental illness and I/DD . The acuity level of challenging behavior s requires intensive 24 -hour supervision and behavioral support services to ensure safety to themselves and the community. Challenging behaviors range from aggression toward people or property, including self-injurious behaviors. SACU also supports up to 10 individuals with medically fragile conditions that require 24 - hour nursing care and support services. More than 50 percent of these individuals have a history of criminal charges and/or current or pending legal sanctions. The convictions range from such crimes as assault, criminal mischief, theft, harassment, public indecency, possession, rape, sex abuse, and murder . A number have legal sanctions as a result such as parole, 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |3 Oregon Department of Human Services Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Stabilization and Crisis Unit Program Unit Form probation, Psychiatric Security Review Board (PRSB ), or are registered sex offenders. Some are civilly committed as they have been found to be a danger to themselves or others. The major ity of individual s referred to SACU have an identified need for a secured facility due to their risk of flight and/or offensive behavior. In addition, a large percentage of individual s require a secure placement where housing modifications are implemented to avoid injury to self and others. SACU serves 70 adults who need acute stabilization and crisis services. These individuals have been identified due to extreme behavioral and psychiatric needs that have not been successfully provided in the community. SACU has 15 beds available for children (up to 18 years old) who are in acute crisis situations and require stabilization. These children come from a variety of settings including the family home, foster care, 24 -hour group home care and institutiona l care. SACU serves up to 10 individuals in specialized medical facilities due to their fragile medical conditions and I/DD needs. In all the homes, SACU staff provide services that ensure health and safety needs are met and that the individual has the ability to participate in the community. As the goal of the program is to have the individual live in the most independent, least restrictive community setting, it is important to ensure the individual can be supported in the same type of setting. All of the individuals in SACU qualify for Medicaid, currently use the Oregon Health Plan and are served by Coordinated Care Organizations to meet their medical needs. Since there are high medical, behavioral and mental health needs, the program treatment plans are critical for individual stabilization and coordination of health services. From the initial homes established in 1987 t hrough today, the profile of the individuals served by SACU has dramatically changed. As private agencies increase d their skills t o meet challenging needs and were able to provide services, the individual who needs safety net services has changed. In 2000, SACU had six homes serving 30 p eople with high medical needs. Today these medical homes 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |4 Oregon Department of Human Services Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Stabilization and Crisis Unit Program Unit Form serve only up to 1 0 individual s. These in dividual s now receive care in community and nursing facilities. In the past, the numbers of people with intensive behaviors were people who had a diagnosis of autism. Today, intensive behaviors are related to co-occurring mental health diagnosis and/or c riminal convictions. With the 2015-2017 budget, SACU completely transformed the organizational structure to increase efficiencies and lower injuries and overtime. The agency formed seven island structures within the existing three regions and created a staffing float pool, which allows for more flexibility in direct care staffing. SACU also created the Crisis Outreach Assessment Team (COAT), a rapid -response team that responds to an individual's crisis as it is occurring. COAT also completes mental health assessments allowing SACU to better support the individuals serve d. In addition, SACU contracted with a national consultant, Benchmark, to review SACU as a whole and make recommendations for improved services as well as individual and staff safety. Program Justification and Link to Focus Areas SACU links to the Safer, Hea lthier Communities focus area. SACU helps individuals with intellectual/developmental disabilities be healthy and have the best possible quality of life by helping them live in their communities and work or attend school to achieve their potentia l. Stabilization and training are provided for adults and children who have entered the program in crisis. SACU helps individuals transition back into community settings with support from their families, caregivers or private providers. Individuals enroll ed have no other alternative s for a residential placement. They are in crisis due to a family breakdown; discharge from a hospital, psychiatric or correctional setting, or discharge from a private provider who can no longer support them due to the intensit y of their behavioral or medical needs. SACU provides a critical alternative to assist the person to return to a healthy and productive life through a high -quality residential program, including community - based housing, appropriate nutritional and medical care, and interventions. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |5 Oregon Department of Human Services Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Stabilization and Crisis Unit Program Unit Form In addition, the safety net provided by SACU allows for targeted, community- based support to individuals in crisis or with otherwise unmet intensive needs, individuals receive the services they need for the time they need them and are then assisted to transition back to families or private providers. Program Performance Staff ratios are quite high; at minimum all require a 1:1 staffing level. Many require a greater staffing level while in the community. The goal is to stabilize behaviors and health issues in a residential setting so that transition to a private provider is successful. Average length of stay for SACU adults overall (in both medical and behavioral beds) is 6 years. SACU is focusing on placement of these long-term individuals in private care. These types of individuals, who can now be served by private providers due to improvements in community service skills and capacity, are no longer prioritized for this program. SACU continues to build strong data tr acking, including clinical data (individual s' incidents, medication errors, safety records , restraints, and a number of other elements), staffing data (ratios, overtime ), and programmatic data (admissions, transfe rs, exits, length of stay). SACU u ses this data to make programmatic changes. Enabling Legislation/Program Authorization Virtually all individuals served by SACU are funded through Medicaid Home and Community -Based Waivers and the 1915(k ) Medicaid State Plan. The individuals served by SACU would be entitled to nursing home or intermediate care f acilities for persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities (ICF/ IDD) institutional services. Oregon no longer uses institutional care, but the service would be required if we could not meet the need in the community. Other federal laws and rulings that impact services delivered through SACU are the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Supreme Court Ruling in Olmstead v. L.C. (1999) , which generally require individuals to be served in least restrictiv e, non-institutional settings. Oregon commitment statutes in ORS 427 also require the 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |6 Oregon Department of Human Services Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Stabilization and Crisis Unit Program Unit Form State to provide care and custody to a person who presents harm to themselves or others, and SACU's status as the safety net is integral to accomplishing this. Additional statutes that guide the delivery and program are found in ORS 412, 430, 409 and 410. The Oregon Administrative Rules (OARs) that govern the operations of SACU require that individuals be supported in the com munity and in pursuit of educational and vocational activities. At the Federal level, in addition to all applicable Medicaid statutes and regulations, services must comply with the Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 and Section 504 of t he Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Compliance with these Federal laws is subject to the U.S. Supreme Court's Olmstead decision of 1999 and the U.S. Department of Justice's interpretation of that decision as it relates to the ADA and Rehabilitation Act. The Olmstead ruling is relevant to SACU in that it requir es all services allowed in the waiver, including SACU, create inclusion in the community equitably across the state. Funding Streams The services are designed and approved using a Medicaid 1915( c) Home and Community -Based Waiver and a 1915( k) Medicaid State Plan which provides a federal match to the program's General Fund. The program funding match rate is 63 percent federal funds and 37 percent General Fund for waiver services and 69 percen t feder al funds and 31 percent General Fund for 1915 (k) State Plan services. Based on their income level, some individuals also pay an Other Funds contribution toward their room and board costs. Funding Justification and Significant Changes to CSL There are no investments in the Agency Request Budget, only the regular essential packages that are part of the normal budget build process. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|1 Oregon Department of Human Services Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Employment First Program Unit Form Oregon Depa rtment of Human Services: Employm ent First Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Services Prim ary Outcome Area: Thriving Oregon Economy Secondar y Outcome Area: Safer Healthier Communities Program Contact: Acacia McGuire Anderson, 503 -884-4910 Program Overview Employment First is a nationwide initiative which helps individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities ( I/DD) reach and maintain competitive integrated employment by ensuring that employment is the first and priority option in each state. Research has shown that pe ople who are employed in the commun ity have the highest level of integration and have s tronger social networks. The more people with developmental disabilities that achieve paid employment, the less dependen ce there is on public resources and the greater the state's flexibility in designing future services 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|2 Oregon Department of Human Services Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Employment First Program Unit Form that respond to the need of this popu lation. For these reasons and many more, in 2008 Oregon was an early adopter of the Employment First initiative . Employment First is both a national initiative and a state policy. In Oregon, Employment First includes the ODHS Office of Developmental Disabilities Services ( ODDS ), ODHS Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) , and the Oregon Department of Education (ODE) . Employment First is working to increase employment opportunities for individuals with I/DD. New federal regulations, as well as the Lane v. Brown settlement agreement, place even greater emphasis on the state's need to provide community- based employment services to people with I/DD. Finally, due to COVID-19 there has been an interruption in employment services a nd an increase in job loss or job reduction; this is in part because people with I/DD are at greater risk of negative effects from COVID -19. As individuals decide to return to work, increase hours, etc. the Employment First services become even more critical. These services ca n help people with I/DD identify accommodations that can help keep them safe and healthy while at work and can also help people return to work. Program Description Employment First is based on the general philosophy that individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities have the ability to be productive and contributing members of their communities through work. This philosophy also recognizes intrinsic and financial benefits of paid work to individuals with disabilities and the ir families, and that improved economic self -sufficiency has been shown to reduce reliance on government services. Oregon has been very successful in developing community -based care to move away from institutions as a model of care. Having individuals with developmental disabilities fully engaged in their communities is highly desirable as an outcome and fiscally efficient. The Employment First initiative is designed to ensure that employment supports are provided in the community. All people with developmental disabilities who are eligible to rece ive services through either the Comprehensive or Support S ervices waiver an d the Community First Choice (K Plan ) may choose to receive residential suppo rt through in-home services, fos ter care, group homes or supported living services, as well as employment and/or day services. Employment supports include : Employment Path services - supporting individuals in learn ing employment skills 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|3 Oregon Department of Human Services Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Employment First Program Unit Form Supported Small Group services - supports for individuals to work in the community with up to seven other individuals who have disabilities and make minimum wage or better Job coaching - support to work independently in a community -based job making minimum wage or better Discover y - a time -limited service designed to help an individual learn more about their employment strengths and potential job interests The Employment First policy states that work in integrated jobs is the first and priority option in planning employment services for working -age adults and youth. Services should be planned to use person -centered practices that identify an individual's talents, skills, and interests. This information can then help inform employment options and career opportunities. In 2014, CMS issued additional guidance regarding their Hom e and Community Based Services (HCBS) regulation requiring that employment supports be community -based by March 2019. Further, DHS reached a settlement in the Lane v. Brown case in January 2016 which requires that ODDS, VR , and ODE work together to ensure that individuals who are currently in a sheltered workshop (or who have been in a sheltered workshop as of 2012) or individuals eligible for ODDS services transitioning out of high school receive supported employment services to help them obtain competitive integrated employment. Additionally, the Rehabilitation Act was amended formally as of June 30, 2016 via the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act , which requires competitive integrated employment as the outcome to be consider ed a successful placement through VR. These federal and state changes, as well as i mplementing Employment First policies, require some fundamental systems transformation . Many providers needed supp ort to change business practices to suppo rt individuals in jobs throughout their commun ities. Due to this technical assistance and other support, the last sheltered workshop in the state of Oregon closed August 31, 2020. It continues to be critical for business partners to embrace the benefits of hiring people with developmen tal disabilities. Employment First partners with the Oregon Coun cil on Dev elopmen tal Disabilities and other stakeholder and advocacy organizations to develop policies and communi cations that strengthen employment outcomes. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|4 Oregon Department of Human Services Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Employment First Program Unit Form As part of the department's strategic planning to integrate those with developmental disabilities into their communities, as well as new federal regulations which require that all employment supports be community -based , Oregon has moved away from the Sheltered Workshop model into a community based model as the last Sheltered Workshop in Oregon closed August 31, 2020 . For people with developmental disabilities, the goal is that their time in career exploration and hours working in the community will increase and time spent in sheltered workshops decreases. This goal aligns with federal regulations, as well as the Lane v. Br own settlement agreement. Program Justification and Link to Focus Areas Employment First links to the Thriving Oregon Economy focus area. I ndividuals with developmental disabilities are healthier, safer and happie r when they are engaged in meaningful work. I ndividuals are more likely to be able to live with their family longer when they have their own daily schedule that is similar to work ing parents. As with all other citizens, for individuals with I/DD, employment has many positive impacts. These impacts include increasing self -worth, building relationships, and access to community resources. Employment improves economic well -being as well as physical and mental health. Employment support s are k ey in movi ng people with developmental disabilities away from 24-hour support services, which results in fewer public funds being spent. Employment First also links to other economi c development strategies to increase workforce diversity while meeting business needs in ways that result in jobs and prosperity for all Oregonians. Hiring people with disabilities is not only of benefit to those individuals, but also to businesses. Businesses report that their employees with disabilities help with overall retention, contribute to a positive workplace culture, are dedicated and hard w orkers, etc. Some information from Oregon employers can be found here: Employer Testimonial . Program Performance Employment trends have been tracked since 2007. Since Employment First began in 2008 , there has been growth in commun ity employment. Additionally, according to the September 2022 Employment Outcome Survey data 1,536 people received individual supported employment services (this was after the rate dropped to about 1100 people in September 2020 due to COVID -19). This is a 25 percent increase in people working in individual supported employment services from March 2018 . For 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|5 Oregon Department of Human Services Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Employment First Program Unit Form more information, please visit the Employment First Outcomes and Successes Report . Employment First and its partners have reached the goals outlined in the 2015 -2017 Bid ensuring that by 2016, no tr ansition age youth may enter a sheltered w orkshop when leaving school as there were no new entries into a sheltered w orkshop setting allowed by Oregon Administrative Rule as of 7- 1-2015. Although there were over 4,200 individuals in a sheltered workshop setting (totaling more than 45 s heltered workshops) in 2012, currently there are none. For more details regarding pr ocess, please visit our bi -annual data reports: http://www.oregon.gov/DHS/EMPLOYMENT/EMPLOYMENT-FIRST/Pages/data - reports.aspx Employment First Goals: By June 30, 2022 , based on the Lane v. Brown settlement , Employment First (through ODDS and Vocational Rehabilitation ) must place 1,115 individuals currently or recently in a sheltered workshop in competitive integrated employment ; and By June 30, 2022 , base d on the Lane v. Brown settlement and Executive Order 15-01, Employment First must provide supported employment services to 4,600 transition age youth or individuals currently or recently in a sheltered workshop. This is required by the Lane v. Brown Settlement Agreement and ODHS along with ODE is progressing toward system change to ensure these outcomes are reached . To date, Oregon has achieved these goals and is in substantial compliance with the Lane v. Brown Settlement Agreement. However, COVID- 19 has impacted provider capacity. This makes this biennium critical to ensuring that Oregon continues to meet the new Key Performance Measure goal of ensuring 1700 individuals with ID D are working by 2026. Without continued efforts, Oregon stands to lose providers who deliver these services and ultimately, could fail to meet metrics. Enabling Legislation/Program Authorization The provisions of employment-related services for individuals with developmental disabilities are in ORS 430.610, .650, and .670. The enabling statutes are in ORS 409.050 and ORS 410.070. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|6 Oregon Department of Human Services Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Employment First Program Unit Form At the federal level, in addition to all applicable Medicaid statutes and regulations such as the Home and Community Based Services regulation and Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act mentioned above , services must comply with the Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990. Compliance with these federal laws are subject to the U.S. Supreme Court's Olmstead decision of 1999 and the U.S. Department of Justice's interpretation of that decision as it relates to the ADA and Rehabilitation Act. ADA and Olmstead are relevant to Employment First since the program must assure statewide access in the least restrictive environment. As of January 2016, the Lane v s. Brown case has been formally settled and Oregon via ODHS and ODE are mandated to effectively implement policies to achieve the required outcomes of the Settlement Agreement , which is mandated under federal jurisdiction. Fundin g Streams All funding for Employment First through ODDS i s matched through the Medicaid 1915 (c) Home and Commun ity-Based Waiver. When a person is getting job development from Vocational Rehabilitation (VR), OVRS Title 1 case service funding is used. Funding Justification and Significant Changes to CSL Due to the timing of the release of GB, details lower than Division level were not available . 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|1 Oregon Department of Human Services Vocational Rehabilitation Program Narrative Oregon Department of Human S ervices Vocational Rehabilitation Program Program Vision Every Oregonian with a disability who desires to work is given an equitable opportunity and means. Program Mission Vocational Rehabilitation's mission is to assist Oregonians with disabilities to achieve, maintain and advance in employment and independence. About V ocational Rehabilitation Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) is a state and federal program authorized by state law and the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and amended in 1998 and in 2014 by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA). VR staff work in partnership with Oregonians with disabilities, communit ies and businesses to develo p employment opportunities and provide individualized services t o each eligible person. Employment helps people with disabilities live independently, become involved in their communities and live more engaged and satisfying lives. VR helps Oregonians with disabilities gain employment through a variety of services. These include but are not limited to : Helping youth with disabilities transition to jobs as they become adults, Providing individualized counseling and supports to job seekers with disabili ties to help overcome barriers to employment, Helping employers realize and receive the benefit s of employing diverse people with disabilities, and Partnering with other state and local organizations that coordinate and 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|2 Oregon Department of Human Services Vocational Rehabilitation Program Narrative provide equitable employment and wor kforce programs. All working -age Oregonians who experience a disability and are legally entitled to work are potentially eligible for VR services. Individuals who experience a medical, cognitive or psychiatric diagnosis that results in a functional impediment to employment are typically eligible. Recipients of Social Security disability benefits are presumed eligible for services. VR has a diverse staff of counselors with interdisciplinary expertise in the areas of : Intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD) Deafness and hearing loss Mental health Motivational interviewing Spinal injury Traumatic brain injury Other disabil ity specific areas of specialization Additionally, VR counselors consider the participant's cultural and linguistic needs and the intersection of barriers to employment that race, language and disability can present for Oregonians seeking employment . Individuals VR serves VR employees provide direct services through a network of local offices across Oregon. Visit the ODHS website for a full list of local VR offices. Services are pr ovided by rehabilitation counselors, transition service specialists, workforce and business coordinators, support staff and contracted employment specialists who deliver direct client services through 34 field offices around the state . VR, as a core W orkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) partner , is also co-located in some WorkSource Oregon Centers and other human services agencies across the state as part of an effort to increase access to the larger workforce support system in Oregon . VR is responding to historical inequities in service access a nd to changing Oregon 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|3 Oregon Department of Human Services Vocational Rehabilitation Program Narrative demographics by prioritizing equity in our service delivery model and providing culturally and linguistically appropriate services . In State Fiscal Year 2021 , VR : Helped 12,240 individuals , including 3,570 who enter ed an individualized plan for employment and 2,562 who obtained employment outcomes . Contract ed with 65 sites on behalf of over 200 high schools to provide VR Plan services for approximately 1,300 students . Provided Pre -Employment Transition Services for more than 5,000 students . Helped 574 individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD) obtain jobs . Served 930 Oregonians who reported some level of he aring loss as their primary disability , representing 8 percent of the total population served that year. Among the clients rehabilitated in VR in SFY 2021: 78 were American Indian or Alaskan Native 250 were Hispanic or Latino 1,796 were White 47 were African American 18 were Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander 37 were Asian Programs and Services VR services are provided in five primary areas: Substantial VR services Youth programs Supported employment Career counseling information and referral Independent living 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|4 Oregon Department of Human Services Vocational Rehabilitation Program Narrative VR is also engaged in Oregon's Employment First program in partnership with the ODHS Office of Developmental Disability Services and is actively engaged in improving workforce partnerships as part of a core partner in state workforce programs. Substantial VR Services These are individualized services provided to VR clients whose disabilities present a barrier to employment. A rehabilitation counselor conducts a comprehensive assessment to evaluate a client's career potential. This includes assistance determining which services can help support an individual in achiev ing their employment potential. Vocational counseling and guidance build on this assessment and help the client identify a vocational goa l. The counselor works with the client to develop an individualized plan for employment and helps the client access appropriate services in support of the plan. Youth Programs a) Youth Transition Program (YTP): YTP is a partnership between VR, the Oregon Department of Education (ODE), the University of Oregon's College of Education and local Oregon school districts. At least 75 percent of students with disabilities in YTP complete high school and transition to a job or postsecondary education at a rate exceeding the national average . 97.5 percent of YTP students who exited last year did so with a state -recognized completion document . This internationally and nationally recognized school -to-work transition program is a p roven best practice for supporting young people with disabilities. YTP bridges the gap between school and work by coordinating vocational rehabilitation services while the student is in school and ensuring a smooth transition to adult services and employme nt after completi ng school. YTP currently serves more than 6,300 students in more than 200 school s across Oregon. b) Pre-Employment Transition Services (Pre -ETS): In 2014, Congress passed the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA). Th e legislation 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|5 Oregon Department of Human Services Vocational Rehabilitation Program Narrative allows students ages 14- 21 who are potentially eligible for VR services to receive Pre -Employment Transition Services (Pre -ETS). These services provide students an opportunity to access: Career Exploration Post-Secondary Counseling Self-Advocacy Instruction Work -Based Learning Experiences Workplace Readiness Training Pre-ETS services are organized and delivered in collaboration with Local Education Agencies and Local Education Service Districts. In 20 21, VR provided 15,638 pre-empl oyment transition services to 5,949 students. Supported Employment Services These services are for individuals with the most significant disabilities for whom employment is not possible through traditional means, but who can obtain and maintain competi tive employment in the community with job coaching and ongoing supports. Substantial and supported employment services are provided on a time -limited basis for each client. Oregon Health Authority, ODHS Office of Developmental Disability Services, other community programs, families and private employers are responsible for the subsequent services once VR has found employment for an individual and completed training. Supported Employment Services provide individuals with both traditional VR services and support services provided by job coaches, typically at job sites. Career Counseling, Information and Referral (CCIR) The WIOA created CCIR services in the 2014 update to the Rehabilitation Act and states began related subminimum wage projects in 2017. These services provide career counseling, information, and referral to individuals of any age known by VR to be employed at subminimum wage. Employers with 14C certificates from Department of Labor are allowed to employ individuals at less than minimum wage . These employers are required to inform employees about training opportunities but are prohibited from providing CCIR services as the latter is a VR function. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|6 Oregon Department of Human Services Vocational Rehabilitation Program Narrative Independent Living These s ervices are available through seven Centers for Independent Living (CILs). The CILs are nonprofit organizations that provide : Information and referral to services Independent living skills training Peer counseling Systems and individual advocacy Transition services fo r youth CILs also provide a range of services based on local needs, many of which compl ement services provided through other state and federally funded programs. Services are provided through a peer -mentoring model with an emphasis on self - help, self - advocacy, and consumer responsibility. CILs are part of a federal program established in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Oregon's State Independent Living Council was established by Governor's Executive Order 94-12 in 1994. VR is the Designated State Entity for the SILC and the CILs in Oregon and has the responsi bility to: Receive, account for, and disburse funds received by the state Provide administrative support services to the CILs Keep records and provide access to such records as required by the Administration on Community Living (the federal authority for t he Independent Living program) Fund and support the State Independent Living Council's resource plan The Work Incentive Network (WIN) provides benefits planning through contracts with six CILs. Through the state's General Fund dollars, WIN is able to prov ide benefits and work incentives planning to any Oregonian with a disability who receives a public benefit and who wants to obtain, maintain, or increase their employment. In doing so, the network empowers i ndividuals to make informed decisions regarding t heir employment and benefits while 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|7 Oregon Department of Human Services Vocational Rehabilitation Program Narrative understanding how to maintain access to crucial services and medical coverage. People who successfully have access to and receive disability benefits are better able to secure employment, live independently, engage with their communities, and live a higher quality of life. Through employment, they also pay taxes and reduce reliance on publicly funded services. VR Partnerships Employment First Youth and adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD) ar e significantly underrepresented in Oregon's workforce. With appropriate services and assistance, most people with I/DD can work successfully in the community. The state is seeking to increase employment of and work opportunities for people with I/DD by achieving targeted outcomes that align with the Employment First policy and the Lane vs. Brown Settlement Agreement . The Governor's Executive Order (EO) 13-04 and subsequent EO 15- 01 directs state agencies and programs, including VR, O DHS Office of Developmental Disability Services and the Oregon Department of Education, to increase community-based employment services for people with I/DD and to reduce state support of sheltered work. VR has specialized counselors around the state committed to working with people with I/DD to help them find employment in the ir communit ies. Tribal Partnerships The VR program continues to partner with and support the Triba l VR p rograms of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, Warm Springs, Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians, Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde and Klamath Tribes. Each federally recognized Tribe shares a unique vision for its program and identifies how ODHS VR can support the deliver y of services to 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|8 Oregon Department of Human Services Vocational Rehabilitation Program Narrative Tribal members. This collaboration includes: Supporting shared clients with complex disability- based barriers to employment who require specialized rehabilitation services Cross -training new VR counselors on the cultural customs specific to the Tribal Nation Hosting j oint rehabilitation trainings for state and Tribal VR counselors Facilitating Tribal VR directors and Tribal leaders to meet with the ODHS Director Sharing spac e within WorkSource buildings Workforce Partnerships With the passage and implementation of the Workforce Opportunity and Innovation Act (WIOA) of 2014, VR has been identified as a core partner in the workforce system. VR has been working closely with the core workforce partners to create a system that is less siloed, more efficient, inclusive, equitable and diverse. VR, ODHS Self Sufficiency Program s, the Oregon Employment Department, local workforce development boards and Adult Basic Education programs around the state have been meeting to ensure all services are aligned and minimiz e duplication and to creat e opportunities for expanding services in ways that meet the needs of shared client s. Moving toward this shared purpose has increased awarene ss of the needs of individuals with disabilities seeking employment while creating more opportunities for clients in local communities . VR continues to create diverse opportunities for individuals with disabilities to gain equitable access to employment supports and to benefit from various workforce strategies. Moving forward, VR will enhance employer outreach strategies to demonstrate that VR's diverse clients are reliable, dependable, and skilled workers who also happen to have disabilities. VR will also engage 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page|9 Oregon Department of Human Services Vocational Rehabilitation Program Narrative employers to provide work- based learning opportunities for all clients, including youth transitioning into post-secondary careers and apprenticeships. One of th ese opportunities is the federally funded Inclusive Career Advancement Program that will provide 500 people with disabilities with the supports they need to access a postsecondary education. As a core partner in the workforce system, VR is represented on the nine local workforce development boards in Oregon. VR also ha s a large role in the statewide Workforce and Talent Development Board. VR and its workforce partners have developed and updated the unified state plan that guides collaborative efforts to build an effective and strong workforce support system throughout Oregon. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |1 Oregon Department of Human Services Vocational Rehabilitation Program Unit Form Oregon Department of Human Services: Vocational Rehabilitation Primary Long -Term Focus Area: A Thriving Oregon Economy Secondary Long -Term Focus Area: Safer, Healthier Communities Program Contact: Keith Ozols Vocational Rehabilitation Funding Sources, Caseload Levels and FTEs Note: Cost -per-case increase is the result of a growing number of people with cognitive disorders requiring services that come with higher costs. Program Overview Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) helps Oregonians with disabilities obtain, maintain, regain and advance in employment through counseling, specialized training and job placement. This includes helping youth with disabilities transition from educational progr ams to the workforce ; assisting adults with disabilities in achiev ing, maintain ing or advanc ing in employment; helping employers overcome barriers to employing people with disabilities ; and partnering with other state and local organizations that coordinate employment and workforce programs. The public workforce system in Oregon, of which VR is a federally mandated member, includes the following state agency partners: Oregon Employment Department 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |2 Oregon Department of Human Services Vocational Rehabilitation Program Unit Form (OED), ODHS Self Sufficiency Program s (SSP), VR and the Highe r Education Coordinating Commission (HECC). Agencies work in conjunction with the Governor's Office and Local Workforce Development Boards. A Workforce System Executive Team is tasked with communication and coordination among partners and en suring system a lignment. 885,741 adults in Oregon have a disability (2020 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System). This is equal to 26 percent ( or 1 in 4) of Oregon adults . Employment helps people with disabilities become more self -sufficient and involved in their communities and live more engaged and satisfying lives. All working -age Oregonians who experience a disability that creates a barrier to employment , and are legally entitled to work , are potentially eligible for VR services. Individual s who experience a medical, cognitive or psychiatric diagnosis that results in an impediment to employment typically are eligible for services. Recipients of Social Security disability benefits are presumed eligible for services. Approximately 95 percent of all eligible clients currently served by VR are people with significant disabilities . These individuals typically experience multiple functional limitations requiring several services provided over an extended period. VR has counselors who specialize in the areas of intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD), deafness and hearing loss , mental health, motivational intervention, spinal injury and traumatic brain injury; however , the majority of VR counselors provide services to a wide array of Ore gonians with disabilities. Services are provided by rehabilitation counselors and support staff who deliver direct client services through 34 VR field offices and through single employee outstations in one -stop career centers and other human services agencies across the state. Specialized services designed to maximize clients' independence are provided through seven Centers for Independent Living (CILs) located throughout the state. Information, r eferral and comprehensive services are provided. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |3 Oregon Department of Human Services Vocational Rehabilitation Program Unit Form VR staff work in partnership with community organizations and businesses to develop employment opportunities for people with disabilities. These activities range from live resume events and job fairs to presenting disability awareness workshops in local businesses. VR also offers business services that include consultations with employers about dive rsifying their workforce by hiring people with disabilities, and pre -screening services to match employers with clients who are qualified, reliable job candidates. Program Description VR is comprised of five primary areas: basic services, youth programs, supported employment, career counseling information and referral and independent living. VR is also engaged in Oregon's Employment First initiative. VR is a core partner in the implementation of the Workforce Innovations and Opportunities A ct (WIOA) and is committed to improving access to the workforce system for Oregonians with disabilities. VR works with the Commission for the Blind and Oregon's Tribal VR (121) Programs. Substantial Services These are basic services provided to individuals whose disabilities present an impediment to employment. The Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) conducts a comprehensive assessment to evaluate vocational potential, including diagnostic and related se rvices necessary for the determination of program eligibility as well as the nature and scope of services to be provided. Vocational counseling and guidance build on this assessment and help the client identify a vocational goal. The counselor, in partners hip with the client, develops an individualized plan for employment and authorizes services and training in support of the plan while maintaining a counseling relationship with the client. Youth Transition Program (YTP) YTP operates as a partnership betwe en VR, the Oregon Department of Education (ODE), the University of Oregon's College of Education and local Oregon school districts. Currently serving about 2,400 students in more than 120 school districts, YTP bridges the gap between school and work by providing coordinated vocational rehabilitation services while the student is in school and ensur es a smooth transition to adult services and employment after completion of school. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |4 Oregon Department of Human Services Vocational Rehabilitation Program Unit Form Local YTP teams deliver pre -employment transition services so students can beg in career exploration while they are still in school. These services include career counseling, counseling on postsecondary education and training options, work-based learning experience, work-readiness skills development and training in self - advocacy. At least 7 5 percent of students with disabilities in YTP complete high school and transition to a job or postsecondary education - a rate that exceeds the national average. This internationally and nationally recognized school -to-work transition approach is a best practice for young people with disabilities . Supported Employment Services These services enable Oregonians, including youth, with the most significant disabilities to achieve and maintain competitive integrated employment. Vocational Rehabilitation supported employment services (i.e., job coaching, training normally done at the job site) are time -limited, lasting from job place ment until the individual is stable in their job and long- term supports are in place. Oregon Health Authority's Behavioral Services, community programs and families , ODHS Office of Developmental Disability Services or private employers provide long -term supports after the individual reaches job stabilization, which continue after the client has exited the VR Program. Career Counseling, Information and Referral The WIOA created CCIR services in the 2014 update to the Rehabilitation Act and states began related subminimum wage projects in 2017. These services provide career counseling, information and referral to individuals of any age known by VR to be employed at subminimum wage. Employers with 14C certificates from the Department of Labor are allowed to employ individuals at less than minimum wage. These employers are required to inform employees about training opportunities but are prohibited from providing CCIR services as the latter is a VR function. Program Justification VR assists indiv iduals with disabilities to establish a foundation by identifying a personal vision, goals and steps necessary to achieve success in education and employment, and to become independent, productive members of their 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |5 Oregon Department of Human Services Vocational Rehabilitation Program Unit Form communities. The VR program and the servic es provided align with Governor Brown 's initiative s relating to s afer and h ealthier communities, which point to higher rat es of employment as key ingredients in community well -being. This is especially important in relationship to Oregonians with disabilities , who are underrepresented in the workforce. Secondarily, by creating better access to the workforce system, we are increasing the number of employable Oregonians, many of whom bring in skills and attributes that contribute to a thriving Oregon economy. Employment and Jobs The VR Program has developed a plan in partnership with the workforce system as defined by the Workforce Innovations and Opportunities Act (WIOA) which includes goals regarding employment outcomes for clients, to increase skills upgrading and certification of Oregonians with d isabilities seeking employment As a result of the Lane v . Brown Settlement , the state is seeking to increase employment of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD) in integrated workplaces through increased efforts around the Employment First initiative. The Governor's Executive Ord er 15 -01 and the Settlement Agreement directs state agencies and programs, including VR, ODHS' Office of Developmental Disabilit ies Services (ODDS) and the Oregon Department of Education (ODE), to increase community-based employment services for people wit h I/DD and to reduce state support of sheltered work. VR has specialized counselors around the state committed to working with people with I/DD to find employment in the community. VR is continuing to increase community engagement with communities of color , non - or limited -English speaking communities and other communities across the state. VR works with ODHS to provide information in alternative formats and language to communities across the state. Program Performance Vocational Rehabilitation measures its performance primarily by employment outcomes. Employment outcomes are defined as the number of individuals who obtained and successfully maintained employment for a minimum of 90 days. The 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |6 Oregon Department of Human Services Vocational Rehabilitation Program Unit Form Workforce Innovation and Opportunities Act of 201 4 added several measures with emphasis on long -term employment. Education The internationally recognized Youth Transition Program has expanded to more than 120 school districts in Oregon. More than 75 percent of students with disabilities in YTP complete high school and transition to a job or postsecondary education, a rate that exceeds the national average. YTP bridges the gap between school and entry into the workforce by providing coordinated vocati onal rehabilitation services while the student is in school and ensuring a smooth transition to adult services and employment after completion of school. YTP currently serves about 2,388 students in more than 120 school districts. VR utilizes Supported Employment, an evidence -based model, which allows individuals with developmental and intellectual disabilities to work in competitive employment in the community with needed supports. The Independent Living program partners with schools and famil ies to support the transition of students with disabilities to secondary education and/or work. Memorandums of Agreement with the Office of Developmental Disabilities Services and the Oregon Department of Education are designed to more effectively align transition services, identify opportunities to braid and leverage funding in order to increase the number of students with disabilities. Introduction of services in partnership with ODE to meet WIOA requirements to expend 15 percent of our Federal F unds to meet Pre - Employment Transition Services as required by the WIOA. Healthy and Safe Communities The Independent Living Program consists of the following partners: 7 Centers for Independent Living, Oregon State Independent Living Council, Oregon Comm ission for the Blind and ODHS Vocational Rehabilitation. Federal funding is provided through the Administration on Community Living (ACL ) in both direct awards to individual centers and pass -through funding through the Vocational 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |7 Oregon Department of Human Services Vocational Rehabilitation Program Unit Form Rehabilitation program. Pass -through funding requires a minimum State General Fund (SGF) match of 10 percent . The mission of the Independent Living Network as established through the State Plan for Independent Living (SPIL) is to empower people in Oregon who experience disabilities to direct their lives, access their communities and fulfill their responsibilities at their desired level of independence. Centers for Independent Living Centers for Independent Living (C ILs) are non -residential community -based organizations that provide services and advocacy for individuals with all types of disabilities. There are nearly 500 CILs across the United States. There are seven private , nonprofit CILs in Oregon. Each CIL has a board of directors. At least 51 percent of board membership must consist of people with disabilities. CIL staff play an important role in the delivery of services to enhance the independence of people with disabilities and are also, as required by the Rehabilitation Act, composed of 51 percent people with disabilities. Services provided in CILs include peer support, independent living skills training, information and referral, advocacy and transition including services that : Facilitate transition from nursing homes and other institutions to the community, Provide assistance to those at risk of entering institutions, and Facilitate transition youth to postsecondary life. CILs also work to make communities more accepting of individuals with disabilities. CILs provide services to individuals of all ages and all disabilities. The seven CILs in Oregon are located in Portland, Eugene, Roseburg, Grants Pass, Klamath Falls, Bend and Ontario and are contracted to serve 22 of the 36 counties throughout the state . CILs are mandated through the federal Rehabilitation Act, under the Administration for Community Living (ACL). Title VII, Chapter 1 of the Act states the current purpose of the program is to \"promote a philosophy of independent living including a philosophy of consumer control, peer support, self - help, self -determination, equal access, and individual and system advocacy, in 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |8 Oregon Department of Human Services Vocational Rehabilitation Program Unit Form order to maximize the leadership, empowerment, independence, and productivity of individuals with disabilities, and the integration and full inclusion of individuals with disabilities into the mainstream of American society.\" Oregon State Independent Living Council (SILC) The SILC is established by Executive Order of the Governor as a separate governmental entity, independent of any s tate agency. The Governor appoints the members of the SILC. Member composition of the SILC must also meet the 51 percent majority of people with disabilities as required by the Rehabilitation Act. The SILC has bylaws and policies and procedures that align with the federal requirements set forth in the Rehabilitation Act and Assurances and Indicators of minimum compliance, as well as s tate requirements. Vocational Rehabilitation - Special Services Independent Living Program Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) serves as the Designated State Entity to receive, administer and account for the funds made available to the State under Title VII, Chapter 1, Part B of the Rehabilitation Act and State General Funds appropriated for Oregon's IL Network. The match rate for Title VII, Chapter 1, Part B funds is 10 percent General Fund; 90 percent Federal Funds. All partners of the IL Program receive funds through VR through executed state contracts. Enabling Legislation/Program Authorization VR is a state and federal program authorized by Oregon state law (ORS 344.511et seq.) and the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014. The Independent Living Program is a federal program established in Title VII of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and regulated by the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 45, and Part 1329 .

Program Vision The purpose and vision of OEP is to ensure that people in Oregon who need medical, food, cash and /or child care benefits can access these in a timely manner, without having to navigate across complex systems or being told they are in the wrong line, came in the wrong door or called the wrong number. We are committed to creating and supporting a system where service equity is in the forefront of everything we do. We achieve this by coordinating among Oregon's multiple benefits agencies and programs, integrating our resources so people seeking benefits, as well as agency staff, don't have to look in multiple places for support or assistance . We established governance and developed processes to weave together historically independent units to better support individuals and families. Program Goals 1.Culturally specific and responsive services are provided by highly qualified and diverse staff. 2.The people we serve are given more choices about how we serve them while eq uity, equal access and service excellence is experienced by those that engage with us. 3.Individuals ' li ves and choices are honored and respected in our actions. 4.Decisions and actions are led by c omm unity and staff. 5.Timely and accurate determinations are completed for medical, food, cash and ch ild care benefits.2023-2 5 Ways and Means Page |2 Oregon Department of Human Services Oregon Eligibility Partnership Program Narrative 6.Da ta and systems are available to transparently evaluate our work and provide details to communities, advocates and our staff. 7.G overnance brings agencies together to solve problems and reflect the objectives and outcomes communities are requesting. About the Oregon Eli gibility Partnership O EP bring s eligibility information together from across agencies, providing staff a single resource for direction related to eligibility operations. OEP is also responsible for maintaining the ONE system and coordinating governance, operational direction, quality assurance, hearings and more. O EP consists of ODHS state and c ontracted staff who make financial eligibility determinations for Oregon Eligibility (ONE) programs , which include medical , food, c ash and childcare assistance . These staff are primarily assigned to our Virtual Eligibility Center (VEC), which takes statewide calls and works on application s submitted online. They are part of a larger network which includes ODHS Store Front Office (SFO) and Type B Transfer AAA staff which process statewide work and perform in-person interviews with people seeking or managing benefits . These teams currently serve the highest caseload in Oregon history with almost 1.5 million individuals receiving benefits . OEP encompasses the following programs and units : The VEC and Storefront Offices T he VEC and storefront office staff respond to client inquiries about their applications for benefits , confirm existing coverage and determine financial eligibility for medical, food, cash and childcare benefits. They are the voice and primary ambassadors for these programs , providing resource s by telephone or the customer's other preferred method s of contact including in- person, via mail, or via electronic communication. Customers typically inquire about their application status, information on their benefits and coordination of other benefits or services . They also call to make changes to their personal information that may have an impact on their eligibility. 2023-2 5 Ways and Means Page |3 Oregon Department of Human Services Oregon Eligibility Partnership Program Narrative These staff and the ONE eligibility system serve Oregonians during some of their most critical times, where responsive supports can have critical effect on an individual's ability to thrive. Staff pro vide these supports by processing applications received online or through the mail, over the phone or in an office ; making eligibility determinations, providing due process, and ensuring referrals and support services are provided. These staff focus on honoring individual s' choices about how they want to engage with us, and on bringing the right resources to the people we serve, rather th an making them navigate multiple agencies and divisions to get the benefits they need. C urrently we serve nearly 1.5 million individuals, about 48 percent of whom submit applications online through our statewide applicant portal. We serve every generation from newborns to individuals seeking long-term care or eligibility for end-of-life hospice care. We have provided more benefit dollars for food assistance through pandemic and emergency allotments than during any pre -pandemic period .

The team includes more than 4,000 staff across Oregon who determine eligibility for benefits through the ONE system. H istory and Future ODHS and OHA agreed in January 2021 to establish a single eligibility structure to better ensure transparency, alignment, cohesiveness, equity and streamlined functionality across benefits program areas. This new division would encompass process, system, training, collective impact with partners with the voice of Oregonians, data analytics and metrics, service delivery, and eligibility operations. ODHS created an internal area as the Oregon Eligibility Program, announcing Nathan Singer as the Director, in September 2021. The first phase of bringing central supports within ODHS together around training, service coordination, change management, systems, quality assurance, and hearings was announced in February 2022. In the early part of the winter of 2022, OEP began work with a vendor to establish a roadmap for the future of Eligibility in Oregon. The in tent is to move to the original vision of providing a cohe sive and person -centered s ystem of services by formally moving all eligibility staff under OEP, allowing a single accountable program responsible to each of the three agencies. The work is expected to continue to operationalize this vision through the 2023 -2025 biennium. Program Justification This program is the front door for many in Oregon who need assistance to reach their potential and achieve and maintain health, safety and independence. This program is essential to our core work, providing individuals with benefits and improving service equity by captur ing REAL+D information, honor ing chosen name versus legal name, and providing application options in mu ltiple formats and languages. Program Performance The eligibility staff answer calls, review emails, respond to changes uploaded in applicant portal, and speak with individuals directly who need assistance with applying for or reauthorizing benefits related to m edical, food, cash and child care. Oregon has seen historic growth in OHP caseload and continued growth in in the number of applications for benefits . [HC1]OHP enrollment is now up over 36% 2023-2 5 Ways and Means Page |7 Oregon Department of Human Services Oregon Eligibility Partnership Program Narrative since the start of the pandemic, and ODHS has seen a 26% growth in application. The below chart shows eligibility for medical assistance and OHP programs in September of 2022. At that time nationally the average growth was 29%, you can see Oregon outpaced that growth by almost 4%. F rom July 2020 through April 2022 we received more than 2,131,801 tasks that required staff to take some action related to a new application or redetermination of benefits , or a change to someone's eligibility within the ONE system. During that same time the team was able to process 2,124,005 of those tasks. The graph below shows the number of tasks processed and received. It is important to note that redeterminations for medical had no negative action during the COVID -19 Public Health Emergency, so those and SNAP related tasks could be closed during this time which helped with keeping up with the historic volume of cases. 2023-2 5 Ways and Means Page |8 Oregon Department of Human Services Oregon Eligibility Partnership Program Narrative During a similar timeframe the VEC 800 number received 1,924,548 calls, staff were able to answer 1,074,642 of those calls. Note that callers may have hu ng up due to wait times or calls may have disonnected prior to being able to answer, local offices also receive calls from individuals related toeligibility and those calls are not included in these numbers. During this timeframe the average wait time was 19 minutes for calls answered, average maximum wait time for calls answered was 2 hours and 5 minutes, and the average answer rate was 56 percent . It is important to note that we have not received additional staff to account for the growth nor was this growth reflected in the Department's eligibility workload model going back to the time eligibility was transferr edfrom OHA . Currently, their caseload to worker ratio is the highest of any of our eligibility areas and this is the highest volume since ODHS first started reporting on those ratios decades ago.

ODHS is a business associate of OHA who is the single state Medicaid agency pursuant to 42 CFR 431; and under this authority ODHS performs the determinations for eligibility on behalf of OHA along with Type B AAA county employees. This unique model in Oregon is within ODHS's statutory direction within ORS 410, which allows county governments to choose to perform the duties related to seniors and individuals experiencing a disability on behalf of the Department as outlined in Oregon Administrative Rule (OAR) and statute. Funding Streams Th is program is funded using cost allocation to draw down federal funds from the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services ( CMS) and the Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Services (F NS), as well as General Fund for programs which do not have adm inistrative federal funds , such as Employment Related Day Care (ERDC), T emporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF ) or the General Fund portions of Healthier Oregon or Veteran and COFA dental programs.

The percentage of older adults (65+) needing publicly-funded long term care services Data Collection Period: Jan 01 - Dec 31 * Upward Trend = negative result Report Year 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 LTC In 2022, only 2.71% of Oregonians 65 or older needed assistance with publicly funded long-term care. This is a noticeable downward trend that exceeds legislative targets. Factors Affecting Results Oregon has adopted the Community First Choice Model, also known as the K Plan. This is a big driver in these results as the K Plan has numerous tools that are designed to keep people independent. Additionally, the success of the AAA network administering Oregon Project Independence, Older Americans Act programs and the Aging and Disability Resource Connection contribute towards keeping older adults independent. More preventative programs should be considered to ensure targets continue to be met, ultimately resulting in system sustainability. This should be achievable with recent Legislative direction to expand Oregon Project Independence and development of a new Family Caregiver Support program. We are concerned that part of the decline displayed above is related to fears that older adults may have about receiving LTSS during COVID. Additionally, we are exploring the ONE system's impact on older adults. APD will continue to analyze the factors that are decreasing the utilization of publicly funded long term care. actual target 2023-25 Ways and Means Page|4 Oregon Department of Human Services Key Performance MeasureKPM #2LONG TERM CARE RECIPIENTS LIVING OUTSIDE OF NURSING FACILITIES (APD) - The percentage of Oregonians accessing publicly-funded long-term care services who are living outside of nursing facilities Data Collection Period: Jan 01 - Dec 31 * Upward Trend = positive result Report Year 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 LTC RECIPIENTS LIVING OUTSIDE OF We Doing APD's performance is slightly behind the goals established. Recent challenges of ensuring workforce across the home and community- based care continuum have led to many individuals staying for longer periods of time in nursing facilities. Additionally, statewide policies have focused on Medicaid services and programs. Affordability for private pay individuals in any setting is challenging. Discussions regarding adult foster home rates are promising as are continued rates in other community-based care settings. Medicaid rates, if too low, increase private pay rates and decrease the capacity in home and community-based-care options. The Legislature authorized two innovative programs in the 2021 Legislative Session. The first is an expansion of Oregon Project Independence, which should result in more individuals with higher incomes and assets receiving services in their own home. The second is the development of a new family caregiver support program, designed to support family caregivers maintain their direct care role. Factors Affecting Results Throughout the pandemic, we have learned, that in most cases, hospitals prefer to discharge older adults and people with disabilities needing additional care to nursing facilities. Institutional care may be appropriate for certain individuals for short periods of time. However, alternatives such as reviewing insurance coverage for Home Health and establishing more intensive supports in other settings could help support the state reaching this KPM. For Medicaid consumers, DHS must continue to proactively ensure that older adults and people with disabilities are appropriately transitioned from nursing facilities when their care can be supported actual target 2023-25 Ways and Means Page|5 Oregon Department of Human Services Key Performance Measurein less restrictive and costly settings. Doing this will allow DHS to continue meeting our targets. APD also needs to focus efforts on developing new adult foster homes, addressing the workforce shortage across the long-term care continiuum and preserving our existing provider base. 2023-25 Ways and Means Page|6 Oregon Department of Human Services Key Performance MeasureKPM #3 TIMELY APD ABUSE INVESTIGATIONS - The percentage of abuse reports assigned for field contact that meet policy timelines Data Collection Period: Jul 01 - Jun 30 * Upward Trend = positive result Report Year 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Abuse Investigation Are We Doing As was the case last year, performance on this measure has dropped below the target goal of 95%. Of particular note is the increase in both APS and NF investigations from the last reporting period to the current one. This, combined with the impact of COVID during the reporting period, has resulted in the decline in response timeliness. Factors Affecting Results This measure includes a wide variety of assigned response times and two investigative entities. Community Investigations completed by Adult Protective Services have response times of same day, end of next business day, or within 5 business days. Facility (Adult Foster Home, Assisted Living Facility, Residential Care Facility, Memory Care) Investigations completed by Adult Protective Services have response times of same day and end of next business day. Nursing Facility investigations completed by the Nursing Facility Licensing Unit within Safety, Oversight and Quality have assigned timelines of two days or ten days. During this reporting period, there were 16366 investigations completed by APS (compared with 15486 from the past reporting period, an increase of 5.6%. This is a customary increase in investigation numbers and seems to indicate that numbers have stabilized from those seen during the COVID pandemic). Of those, 16129 (98.6%) received a timely response. This is a slight increase from 98.2% last reporting period. During this reporting period there were 1713 Nursing Facility Investigations (compared with 1303 from the past reporting period, an increase of 31.4%). Of those, 151 (8.81%) received a timely response. actual target 2023-25 Ways and Means Page|7 Oregon Department of Human Services Key Performance Measure2023-25 Ways and Means Page|8 Oregon Department of Human Services Key Performance MeasureKPM #4ABSENCE OF REPEAT MALTREATMENT OF ABUSED/NEGLECTED CHILDREN (CW) - The percentage of abused/neglected children who were not subsequently victimized within 6 months of prior victimization Data Collection Period: Oct 01 - Sep 30 * Upward Trend = positive result Report Year 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 ABSENCE OF REPEAT We Doing The outcome of 93.0% is Federal Fiscal Year 2021 data, for Report year 2022 (October 2020 to September 2021). This period under review indicates a slight decline in absence of repeat maltreatment statewide from the prior reporting year. Factors Affecting Results Cross program collaboration continues to address root cause issues that result in repeat maltreatment of children in Oregon. CQI processes have targeted and improved accuracy of incident date of maltreatment at screening. Oregon statute requires that ORCAH document and assign a new report of abuse for each incident of abuse reported. This at times results in multiple reports for a child victim that have occurred over a period of time, indicating a pattern of abuse that is known such as chronic neglect, exposure to harm through parental factors such as domestic violence and substance abuse, and physically abusive behaviors and parenting practices. Safety and Permanency programs continue to review and coach to improvements on in-home safety plans to improve the sufficiency of safety for children that a safety threat has been identified to ensure that this vulnerable population is not subject to repeat maltreatment. The impacts of COVID-19 on the isolation of children and families, lack of in person school attendance, limited in-home supports and services has not fully been analyzed at a statewide or national level, however it does indicate that many of the risk factors that are known to impact child safety were experienced by a larger population and with less direct prevention service access during FFY 2021. actual target 2023-25 Ways and Means Page|9 Oregon Department of Human Services Key Performance MeasureKPM #5 TIMELY REUNIFICATION OF FOSTER CHILDREN (CW) - The percentage of foster children exiting to reunification within 12 months of foster care entry Data Collection Period: Oct 01 - Sep 30 * Upward Trend = positive result Report Year 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Timely We Doing The outcome of 72.5% is Federal Fiscal Year 2021 data, for Report year 2022 (October 2020 to September 2021). Over the past year, Oregon declined by 2.2 percentage points in this measure. This is the 2 year in a row there has been a decline in the percentage of foster children exiting to reunification within 12 months of foster care entry. Factors Affecting Results A couple of factors may be contributing to the decrease in timely reunification in Oregon. In the last few years, there has been a significant drop in the removal rate of children causing a 30% or so drop in the total foster care population since 2018. The reasons for this are not fully understood; however, because the number of assigned CPS assessments has not similarly decreased, the drop is likely due to practice changes related to child removal decisions. If true, then children of families with lower acuity and, therefore, more likely to return home sooner would decrease in proportion relative to children less likely to return home sooner. A second contributing factor has been the increased workload of CPS workers across the state and its corresponding impact on permanency workloads. To address the shortfall of CPS workers and their increased workload, permanency workers have been assigned to complete CPS assessments in large numbers. This has reportedly interfered with their work in returning children home with their families sooner. actual target nd 2023-25 Ways and Means Page|10 Oregon Department of Human Services Key Performance MeasureIn addition to enhancing reunification efforts through the strategies of the Program Improvement Plan, Quality Assurance Reviews, consultation and ongoing training, the newly created CQI team in Child Welfare has recently launched a statewide initiative to improve CW measures. Through a more in-depth root cause analysis, their plan is to identify better lead measures that improve timeliness to reunification in 12 months. They recently had kick-off meetings in September 2022 with staff and community partners in District 6 and 12. With a greater focus on developing district specific strategies, it is hoped we will see improvements in the measure of timely reunification over the next year. 2023-25 Ways and Means Page|11 Oregon Department of Human Services Key Performance MeasureKPM #6 TIMELY ADOPTION ONCE CHILDREN ARE LEGALLY FREE (CW) - The percentage of legally free children adopted in less than 12 months Data Collection Period: Oct 01 - Sep 30 * Upward Trend = positive result Report Year 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Timeliness of Adoption Once Legally We Doing The outcome of 68.5% is Federal Fiscal Year 2021 data, for Report year 2022 (October 2020 to September 2021). Oregon improved performance in this measure by almost 15 percentage points over the prior year, marking the fourth straight year of improvements. This was the greatest improvement of those four years. The target performance for the past year was also more than 11 percentage points higher than when the department first exceeded the target goal in 2015. This is the highest percentage of children adopted in less than 12 months from legally free since documented tracking of KPM #6 began in 2014. It's also the second straight year when the actual percentage of target met exceeded 50% and the first year it exceeded 60%. Factors Affecting Results Oregon continues to coordinate efforts among ODHS Central Office Child Permanency Program staff, ODHS Local Branch Office staff, Courts, the Juvenile Court Improvement Program (JCIP), and other entities/partners to use CQI strategies and activities outlined in our Performance Improvement Plan (PIP). Adoption processes were streamlined and those continue to be assessed and improved when possible. Trainings and process/procedure guides were developed and implemented for ODHS staff and legal partners regarding methods to better track adoption progress and move adoption work forward timely for each child who has a plan of adoption. ODHS Child Permanency Program staff meet regularly with Juvenile Court Improvement Program (JCIP) staff to assess progress and needed improvements, including assessment of permanency improvement activities through Model Court Teams (MCTs). KPM #6 is also a standing agenda item for the JCIP Advisory Committee quarterly meetings. Targeted tracking of adoption finalization status/progress is done through the ODHS Child Permanency Program staff and assistance is provided to ODHS Local Branch Office staff for efforts to move adoption placement and legally freeing actual target 2023-25 Ways and Means Page|12 Oregon Department of Human Services Key Performance Measureactivities forward simultaneously and timely. 2023-25 Ways and Means Page|13 Oregon Department of Human Services Key Performance MeasureKPM #7 REDUCTION OF RACE/ETHNICITY DISPARITIES IN LENGTH OF STAY (CW) - Outcome disparity in length of stay (reported in months) for children in substitute care by race/ethnicity Data Collection Period: Oct 01 - Sep 30 Report Year 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 a.

Unfortunately all other races experienced at least a small increase (up/more is bad) in average length of stay, which Hispanic children/young adults experiencing the largest increase at nearly 4 months. actual target 2023-25 Ways and Means Page|14 Oregon Department of Human Services Key Performance MeasureFactors Affecting Results This KPM is designed to measure the disparity in length of stay by race for children in foster care. In addition to experiencing disparities in length of stay, Black/African American and Alaskan Native/American Indian children and young adults are disproportionately more likely to enter care as we see in our other equity KPM, but this is a statistic we see reflected nation-wide. Multiple studies show that being black and male are strong predictors for longer length of stay. In addition, older children are more likely to experience a longer length of stay. As this is a brand new KPM it will require further vetting and refinement. Continuing disaggregation by age and location, and attempting to account for other factors that generally contribute to health and well-being, such as education, financial stability, and access to healthcare, will help us more accurately see the differences in performance of this measure by race. 2023-25 Ways and Means Page|15 Oregon Department of Human Services Key Performance MeasureKPM #8CHILDREN SERVED BY CHILD WELFARE RESIDING IN PARENTAL HOME - The percentage of children served in Child Welfare on an average daily basis (in home and foster care) who were served while residing in their parent's home Data Collection Period: Oct 01 - Sep 30 * Upward Trend = positive result Report Year 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 CHILDREN RESIDING AT HOME IN LEAST RESTRICTIVE We Doing The outcome of 22.5% is Federal Fiscal Year 2021 data for report year 2022. This data point indicates Oregon is holding steady on the number of children served in the parental home for FFY 2021. The implementation of a Family Preservation approach with the support of the Family First Act continues to move forward in Oregon. The Family Preservation work began in March 2022 so will not have an impact on this current data. Oregon expects to see an increase in children served in home for FFY 2022 as the preservation work in combination with supportive evidence-based services through Family First are slowly implemented in a phased approach across the state. As stated previously, intentional, and strategic efforts to bring community partners and communities together to develop and support a statewide prevention continuum continue. There also continues to be a focus on putting the Well-being Together Initiative and the Vision for Transformation into action on a local level by strengthening relationships across ODHS programs and within the community and individual families ODHS is serving. Factors Affecting Results Oregon continues to evaluate and develop resources in communities throughout the state to support family stability, children remaining in their homes while working with ODHS or returning home quickly after being placed in substitute care. Oregon continues to focus on family engagement and engaging natural supports for families to manage safety threats while children are in-home. Development of an intentional family preservation program is in the very early design and implementation stages in three ODHS branches across the state that should result in short- and long-term outcomes supporting families being together. Case reviews continue to indicate in-home cases are often closed prior to the family conditions being fully addressed, staff seeing families in home on an infrequent basis or insufficient safety planning resulting in removal and placement in foster care. The family preservation program hopes to address each of these areas. actual target 2023-25 Ways and Means Page|16 Oregon Department of Human Services Key Performance MeasurePlacement of children in foster care is the most restrictive and least desirable outcome to manage child safety. Whenever possible, children who can be safety reunified with their family will continue to receive services in-home. Currently, Oregon's practice for offering in-home cases is inconsistent around the state. The Department believes the implementation of Family Preservation and the services funded through the Family First Act will counter this decline and offer specific focus on children at imminent risk for removal and those reunified after placement in foster care. 2023-25 Ways and Means Page|17 Oregon Department of Human Services Key Performance MeasureKPM #9 TIMELY ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION FOR ODDS SERVICES - The percentage of individuals who apply for ODDS services who are determined eligible within 90 days from application Data Collection Period: Jan 01 - Dec 31 * Upward Trend = positive result Report Year 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 SERVICE ELIGIBILITY - 70% 72% 75% 75% How Are We Doing The annual percentage of applicants who have a determination within 90 days from application has continued to decline since 2021. Factors Affecting Results In 2020, ODDS filed a temporary administrative rule that permitted presumptive determinations to be made in certain circumstances when the full rule could not be applied as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or illness. In late 2021, ODDS received input from CDDPs that they rarely used the presumptive rule to find a person eligible for various reasons. ODDS began educating CDDPs and increased awareness regarding this rule and encouraging determinations to be completed while also arranging for additional testing if necessary. In addition to education and guidance around the presumptive eligibility rule, ODDS began gathering data on reasons why determinations were not made within 90 days following receipt of an application. This data will continue to be gathered analyzed throughout the next fiscal year, but early trends include 34% delay in getting external medical and psychological records; 33% delay in getting psychological evaluations returned even when the appointment occurred well within 90 days and 11% delay at the individual/family choice to pause or delay application process. ODDS continues to collaborate with OHA Admin Exam team on increasing rates of reimbursement which will hopefully invite additional evaluators to become admin exam evaluators and streamlining the prior authorization and payment process for evaluators to remove the administrative burdens that have been brought to the Department's and Authority's attention. Additional factors impacting results include:Limited psychologists willing to accept Medicaid funding for administrative examinations actual target 2023-25 Ways and Means Page|18 Oregon Department of Human Services Key Performance MeasureEducational settings completing fewer intellectual evaluations due to shortage of evaluators resulting in an increase in CDDPs needing to arrange intellectual testing Increased delays in receiving existing medical or psychological evaluations due to fewer support staff at medical and educational offices. 2023-25 Ways and Means Page|19 Oregon Department of Human Services Key Performance MeasureKPM #10ADULTS ENROLLED IN ODDS PROGRAM RECEIVING IN-HOME SERVICES - The percentage of adults enrolled in the Intellectual/Developmental Disabilities program who are receiving services in their own home, including family home Data Collection Period: Jan 01 - Dec 31 * Upward Trend = positive result Report Year 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 75% How Are We Doing Oregon does not have any institutional care settings for people with intellectual/developmental disabilities. All services are provided in a community setting. A strategic goal of ODDS is to support a person's choice on where they live and how they receive their services. The data does not reflect choice in where a person lives. As discussed over the last fiscal year, the goal of ODDS includes opportunity for an individual to choose where they live. Therefore, this data is not useful in identifying whether 66% is reflective of where adults are choosing to live and therefore it is unclear where are target should be. ODDS has proposed to remove this KPM for the reasons identified above. This will be the last report on this KPM. Factors Affecting Results The data available is only reflective of where people are receiving their services, not about choice or availability. ODDS offers a realm of community choice options but in-home services are dependent upon an individual having access to their own home or a family home. Additionally, group homes and foster homes fulfill an essential role in providing supports and services to those that may not have access to in-home supports or whose support needs are specialized enough that providing them in the family home would be challenging for them and their families. actual target 2023-25 Ways and Means Page|20 Oregon Department of Human Services Key Performance MeasureKPM #11SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT SERVICES TO OBTAIN COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT - Number of individuals in sheltered workshop target population receiving supported and/or related employment services from ODDS and VR who obtain competitive integrated employment Data Collection Period: Jul 01 - Jun 30 * Upward Trend = positive result Report Year 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT - EMPLOYMENT FIRST Actual 780 914 1,024 1,110 1,138 Target 565 735 885 1,015 1,115 How Are We Doing ODHS surpassed it's requirement of ensuring at least 1,115 individuals who are eligible for ODDS services who had been in a Sheltered Workshop obtained and kept a job for at least 90 days. This means that ODHS was in substantial compliance with the Lane v Brown Settlement Agreement, and Judge Acosta dismissed this case on August 12, 2022. Factors Affecting Results ODHS (ODDS and VR) worked hard over the course of more than 7 years to ensure people who had been in a Sheltered Workshop could get and keep a competitive, integrated job. ODHS is updating this KPM to continue to focus on ensuring all people with I/DD can access Competitive Integrated Employment. actual target 2023-25 Ways and Means Page|21 Oregon Department of Human Services Key Performance MeasureKPM #12 ABUSE/NEGLECT OF ADULTS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES (ODDS) - The percentage of substantiated abuse/neglect of adults in licensed and endorsed programs Data Collection Period: Jan 01 - Dec 31 * Upward Trend = positive result Report Year 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 ABUSE OF PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL 1.34% Target 1.70% 0% 0% We Doing This metric applies to substantiated abuse of adults in licensed and endorsed programs. Because these programs have sought licenses or endorsements, ODDS can have a direct impact on the provider agencies involved in abuse and neglect. In previous years, most reports of abuse and neglect involved licensed settings. Employees in these settings are mandatory reporters of abuse and are trained to recognize signs of abuse. The estimate of abuse for this population increased by 0.31% over last year's figure. The adult population receiving these services increased 0.7% from 2020 to 2021 (8379 individuals to 8438) and the number of adults with a substantiated abuse allegation rose from 86 in 2020 to 113 in 2021, an increase of 31.4%. Because of a lack of national abuse data, it is a challenge to establish a meaningful IDD abuse rate target. Targets are currently based on trends of historical data. Oregon's recent transition to a Centralized Abuse Management (CAM) information system is providing enhanced tracking and monitoring of abuse referrals and investigations. The CAM system will enhance access and availability of information across the state and greatly improve the ability to make data informed decisions. Factors Affecting Results The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on every facet of life and undoubtedly has impacted the abuse of vulnerable populations for the past two years. While we do not have data that clearly informs how the pandemic influenced populations, there are some important possibilities to consider. Implementation of emergency infection control measures has meant that individuals with developmental disabilities were more isolated than normal. Such isolation could reduce abuse rates simply by reducing person-to-person interactions. However, the isolation increased stress on many actual target 2023-25 Ways and Means Page|22 Oregon Department of Human Services Key Performance Measureand therefore may have increased the potential for negative interactions between IDD clients and their service providers. Decreased staffing may also have reduced the number of potential observers, resulting in reduced reporting of allegations. Viewing the past two years data together, and even with a small increase in the rate this past year, the COVID trend is down significantly from the pre-COVID levels. It appears the unknown COVID factors are having a significant effect on abuse findings and/or reporting for these populations. Additionally, abuse rates for people with intellectual/developmental disabilities can be affected by other factors including:The high acuity and service needs of residents being served in community-based care settings. High turnover rate of treatment and support staff in all settings. An adult's right to make decisions about their living situation, companions, etc. Barriers to the reporting of abuse by cognitively impaired clients. Limited resources available to respond to and support people with intellectual/developmental disabilities who are abused (e.g. domestic violence shelters, counseling resources, etc.). What needs to be done in this area includes: Ongoing training for service coordinators, personal agents, personal support workers, direct support providers, service providers and facility staff in recognizing, reporting, and preventing abuse. Research and collaboration with community response systems and resources, including domestic violence interventions, sexual assault response, mental health services, housing, etc. Coordination and participation with local area multi-disciplinary teams and coordinated-care organizations. 2023-25 Ways and Means Page|23 Oregon Department of Human Services Key Performance MeasureKPM #13HOUSEHOLDS AT, OR ABOVE, LIVING WAGE FOUR QUARTERS AFTER LEAVING SSP PROGRAM - The median percentage of households leaving Self Sufficiency who are at, or above, a living wage four quarters out Data Collection Period: Jul 01 - Jun 30 * Upward Trend = positive result Report Year 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 HOUSEHOLDS AT, OR ABOVE, LIVING 44.80% Target 71% Doing Office of Self-Sufficiency Programs (SSP) is guided by the Oregon Department of Human Services (ODHS) Equity North Star [1] and by the agency's Building Well-being Initiative (BWBI) to advance a future where all who live in Oregon, regardless of race, identity, or place, have the resources and support they need to achieve whole well-being for themselves, their families, and their communities. The Office of Self-Sufficiency Program (SSP) mission is to provide a safety net, family stability and a connection to careers that guide Oregonians out of poverty. Economic mobility is a key social determinant of health. The ability to earn living wages helps maximize human potential. It is well known that families who are employed with incomes at, or just above the federal poverty level often cannot make ends meet. In these circumstances, individuals and families find it difficult to pay for the necessities like food, housing, utilities, child care, clothing, etc. This measure tracks the median percent of participants who exit all Self-Sufficiency programs and are earning at, or above, living wages four quarters after they leave the programs. The most recent data available shows that 44.8 median percent of those participants are earning living wages. This result is slightly higher compared to last year's result of 43.3 median percent. [1] https://www.oregon.gov/dhs/DHSNEWS/Documents/ODHS-Equity-North-Star.pdf Factors Affecting Results This measure relies on Oregon Employment Department (OED) reported earnings for SSP participants one year after they left all SSP programs and comparing these earnings to the most recent actual target 2023-25 Ways and Means Page|24 Oregon Department of Human Services Key Performance MeasureWashington State University Self-Sufficiency Standard for Oregon. It is important to note that only the SSP exiters with income captured by OED are included in the pool. The Self-Sufficiency Standard calculates how much income a family must earn to meet basic needs, with the amount varying by family composition and where they live [1]. This measure may be affected by several things, including the status of the economy, the availability of jobs, geography, standard costs for basic living needs by county, and family composition. It can also be affected by the structure of SSP employment and training programs and the effectiveness of other agency and community partnerships that connect SSP participants into living wage jobs. This year's data tracks SSP program participants who exited all programs in 2020 and tracks their wages one year later. The data reflects the median percent of their wages in 2021 compared to the Self-Sufficiency Standard. The result is most likely attributed to the continuing COVID-19 health pandemic. It is anticipated that next year's data on this measure will reflect the changes in the economy associated with the continuing health pandemic and potentially also the rise in inflation. ODHS continues to enhance our role within the Oregon Workforce System through more aligned and coordinated partnerships and service delivery.Data-sharing agreements are in place to include Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) employment plans in the Oregon Employment Department's (OED) data-system. SNAP Training and Employment Program (STEP) has expanded contracts with local workforce boards. DHS SSP continues to invest in expanded employment and training opportunities and supports: SNAP Training and Employment Program (STEP) has expanded investments in partnership with OED, community colleges and local community organizations, drawing additional federal dollars to offer a more comprehensive set of training and employment opportunities for SNAP participants. Job Opportunity and Basic Skills (JOBS) Program investments include expansion of a more comprehensive model of vocational training and education, expanded supports and payments for family stability services and housing assistance to support Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and former TANF participants. Additionally, ODHS Employment and Training services have benefitted from community focus groups, with an emphasis on prioritizing participant voice and identifying gaps between current services and community needs. Employment and Training services have been expanded upon based on the needs expressed in such forums and ODHS will continue to evaluate policies and program design based on community voice.

The Office of Self-Sufficiency Programs' (SSP) mission is to provide a safety net, family stability and a connection to careers that guide Oregonians out of poverty. Housing is a key social determinant of health and a foundation for successful communities. Affordable and permanent housing improves the quality of life of families by leading to better health, stability, safety and security. Where a person lives can predict their life expectancy [2]. The goal of this measure is to track the percentage of households connecting to Self-Sufficiency programs who report housing stability. In the Summer 2022, SSP conducted a statewide survey of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participants who applied or reapplied for SNAP or other SSP programs in the month of April 2022. The survey was voluntary and deployed in six languages: Arabic, Russian, Somali, Spanish, Vietnamese, and English. Of 22,750 SNAP applicants in April 2022, there were 1,785 survey respondents which represents a 7.8 percent overall response rate. The survey found that 41.6 percent of respondents reported housing stability, slightly higher compared to 38.3 percent in 2021. Based on the survey, 53.2 percent of the respondents reported housing instability, meaning that their housing needs are not fully met. The following is a breakdown by race, ethnicity and disability of participants who responded \" I and/or my family's housing needs are fully met (i.e., I can afford to pay rent/mortgage and utilities without difficulty)\" to the KPM question: \"Please select what you feel is most true for your family now\" actual target 2023-25 Ways and Means Page|26 Oregon Department of Human Services Key Performance Measure Race/ethnicity/disability Percentage American Indian and Alaska Native 43.3% Asian 36.8% Black and African American 17.5% Hispanic and Latino/a/x 48.6% Middle Eastern and North African 16.7%* Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander 50%* Two or more races 39.4% Unknown 41.5% White 39.3% Grand Total 41.6% Individuals with disability(ies) (Included in the counts above)34% *small sample size for this population The following are a few of the quotes from survey respondents who opted to provide more input: \"Rent is so high; I can't afford to continue pay [it] and I'm about to be homeless.\" \"I would like to have my own place, but I cannot afford rent in my area, so I am living with a family member.\" \"[I'm currently living in a car for almost [a] year.\" \"[My] housing is inadequate.

Found at this link: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_02/sr02_181.pdf Factors Affecting Results According to the Department of Housing and Community Services, housing had already emerged as a paramount concern across Oregon and the lack of available housing, high rents and high home prices were driving rapid increases in housing instability and homelessness [1]. These themes rang true and were reflected throughout the SSP well-being survey conducted this year. People repeatedly mentioned a lack of affordable housing: rents are too high, rents are increasing, inflation is making it more difficult to afford housing, people move in with family or friends, or are houseless. The survey also indicates that individuals and families continue doing everything they can to take care of themselves. Based on the survey comments, the phrase \"...housing needs are fully met\" and the word \"stability\" may be relative terms depending on the individual or family's situation. It is also possible that the federal and state funding including child tax credits, other pandemic related benefits, as well as greater amount of rental assistance funds that Community Action Agencies have been deploying during the health pandemic, compared to pre-pandemic years, helped create more housing stability for individuals and families. T he passage of protections as well as additional housing-related investments by the Oregon legislature may have also contributed to housing stability for some survey respondents. It is important to note that the statewide eviction moratorium was still in effect until June 30 and safe harbor protections are still in place for those who applied for rental assistance through September 30 . Over the past five years SSP expanded TANF funded supports to cover housing related emergent needs. SSP has also provided for innovative contracting for housing related services, including navigation services, in partnership with community-based organizations and agencies. SSP continues to partner with Oregon Housing and Community Services and other community-based organizations to ensure families have access to needed housing assistance.

The Office of Self-Sufficiency Programs (SSP) mission is to provide a safety net, family stability and a connection to careers that guide Oregonians out of poverty. Food security has a direct connection to economic mobility - a key social determinant of health. Access to nutritious food helps babies hit milestones, fuels kids as they learn and grow, reduces the chances of chronic disease in adults and makes it more likely seniors are healthy and independent. The goal of this measure is to track the percentage of households connecting to Self-Sufficiency programs who report food security. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) defines food security as having consistent, dependable access to enough food for active, healthy living. The USDA's \"Household Food Security in the United States in 2021\" report found that 10.2 percent of Oregon households were food insecure, not significantly different from 10.5 percent in 2020 [1]. In the Summer 2022, SSP conducted a statewide survey of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participants who applied or reapplied for SNAP or other SSP programs in the month of April 2022. The survey was voluntary and deployed in six languages: Arabic, Russian, Somali, Spanish, Vietnamese, and English. Of 22,750 SNAP applicants in April 2022, there were 1,785 survey respondents which represents a 7.8 percent overall response rate. Based on the survey, 33.5 percent of respondents reported experiencing food security [2]. This year's result is almost six percentage points lower than the food security rate reported in 2021. This means that 63.6 percent of the respondents reported experiencing food insecurity, meaning that their access to adequate food is limited by a lack of money or other resources. actual target 2023-25 Ways and Means Page|29 Oregon Department of Human Services Key Performance MeasureAs a result of the COVID-19 health pandemic, there have been additional federally approved food benefits deployed by ODHS-SSP such as Pandemic Electronic Benefits and maximum SNAP allotments, as well as other USDA approved benefits like school lunches, state-level investments through the food banks, the child tax credit and COVID-19 relief. Survey respondents expressed gratitude for these resources, especially the additional SNAP benefits. A theme that emerged from the comments from survey respondents who opted to provide more input, is that inflation is creating additional pressure for individuals and families to meet their most basic needs.

Our survey population this year is composed of persons applying or reapplying for SNAP or other SSP benefits in April 2022. The continuing COVID-19 health pandemic and rising cost have caused people to experience economic hardship. Many people have turned to ODHS for benefits and services such as the SNAP program. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 health pandemic enrollment in the SNAP program has increased by about 10 percent. Additionally, fewer people are disconnecting from the SNAP program. The increased need is making it difficult for applications for SNAP to be processed timely. Federal waivers do help ease certain application requirements and survey respondents repeatedly expressed appreciation for additional SNAP benefits. One example of these food benefits was issuing maximum SNAP allotments to all households regardless of their countable income. Another example is issuing Pandemic Electronic Benefits Transfers (P-EBT) which allowed for depositing food benefits in an EBT card equal to the value of school meals that children would have received if they had been physically attending school. Oregon continues its outreach efforts to connect with difficult to reach populations, including people of color, by providing information on the benefits of qualifying for and maintaining SNAP eligibility, dispelling myths, providing application assistance, advocating on behalf of participants, and numerous other strategies to reach populations in need. These strategies include identifying and removing barriers to the SNAP program across all populations. We currently collaborate with 15 different community agencies who serve as Oregon SNAP outreach partners. 2023-25 Ways and Means Page|31 Oregon Department of Human Services Key Performance MeasureKPM #16SSP PARTICIPANTS REPORTING GREATER SELF-EFFICACY - The percentage of Self Sufficiency participants who report they feel more confident in their ability to improve their current circumstances because of SSP and other services they were connected to Data Collection Period: Jul 01 - Jun 30 * Upward Trend = positive result Report Year 2018 2019 2020 2021 Doing The Office of Self-Sufficiency Programs (SSP) is guided by the Oregon Department of Human Services (ODHS) Equity North Star [1] and by the agency's Building Well-being Initiative (BWBI) to advance a future where all who live in Oregon, regardless of race, identity, or place, have the resources and support they need to achieve whole well-being for themselves, their families, and their communities. The Office of Self-Sufficiency Programs' (SSP) mission is to provide a safety net, family stability and a connection to careers that guide Oregonians out of poverty. Poverty is multidimensional, meaning that it is more than a lack of adequate income [2]. Multidimensional poverty asserts that there are multiple dimensions of deprivation that must be addressed for people to be equipped to exit poverty and build well-being [3]. This measure aims to track one dimension of poverty: whether participants perceive a sense of influence over their own circumstances. Specifically, we are tracking participants' reported increased self-efficacy and hope as a result of their involvement with Self-Sufficiency Programs and the connections to other services SSP makes. In the Summer 2022, SSP conducted a statewide survey of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participants who applied or reapplied for SNAP or other SSP programs in the month of April 2022. The survey was voluntary and deployed in six languages: Arabic, Russian, Somali, Spanish, Vietnamese, and English. Of 22,750 SNAP applicants in April 2022, there were 1,785 survey respondents which represents a 7.8 percent overall response rate. Based on the survey, 74.2 percent of survey respondents reported feeling more confident about their ability to improve their current circumstances because of their involvement with SSP and the services SSP connected them to. This result is up from 71 percent in 2021. In addition, 75.7 percent of respondents (up from 74.1% in 2021) reported they feel more hopeful about their future as a actual target 2023-25 Ways and Means Page|32 Oregon Department of Human Services Key Performance Measureresult of their involvement with SSP and the services SSP connected them to.

Available online at: https://caporegon.org/what-we-do/the-future/ Factors Affecting Results These results are derived entirely from participants' entries on the SSP well-being survey which will continue to be conducted by SSP each year. The surveys have demonstrated that program accessibility matters as does the way we show up for families in our interactions. We define S elf-efficacy as participants having a sense of control or influence over the events and circumstances that affect them and can act on it. We define Hope as participants' belief that their current circumstances will improve. Our desired outcome is that in partnership with participants, agencies and communities, SSP provides programs and services that maximize the potential that lies within everyone. Foundational to these changes are intentionally involving families; having a philosophy and practice of being person centered; being strengths based and having resources that build broader well-being. Hope and self-efficacy are interactively related, having influence on each other, but are also separate, stand-alone concepts. Self-efficacy often generates hope and hope can inspire a person to feel more able to achieve a goal. The SSP program decided to use two questions and measures to bring greater clarity to the impact of SSP services for each, with the primary KPM of self-efficacy. 2023-25 Ways and Means Page|34 Oregon Department of Human Services Key Performance MeasureKPM #17OVRS CONSUMERS WHO ARE SUCCESSFULLY EMPLOYED AT PROGRAM EXIT - The percentage of Office of Vocational Rehabilitation Services (OVRS) consumers with a goal of employment who are employed at program exit Data Collection Period: Oct 01 - Sep 30 * Upward Trend = positive result Report Year 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 OVRS CLOSED Are We Doing We saw a 2.7 % decrease in OVRS consumers successfully employed at program exit from in 2022 compared to 2021. Considering the continued impact of the pandemic and the disruption to the state's workforce, this is a more positive outcome than expected. Variance in KPM #17 has been less than 3% from 2013 to 2022. There was a steady percentage increase during 2012 to 2016 when the overall economy saw even greater gains. Those gains in the economy have eased and we have seen a softening in the placement rates from 2016 to 2022. A recent report from the Oregon Employment Department that found by April 2022, Oregon's nonfarm payroll employers had regained nine out of 10 jobs lost in spring 2020 it does appear that people with disabilities are recovering at a slower pace compared to job seekers without disabilities. The Oregon target of 65% has historically been optimistic when compared to the national average. For example, in 2020, the last reported average for all VR programs, the national average was 43.8% compared to Oregon's outcome of 55.6%. Oregon VR will continue to work toward increasing this outcome we see value in this measure. Factors Affecting Results Throughout the pandemic, our VR counselors were working with clients to assist them in pursuing their employment goals. Many VR clients have underlying health issues and compromised immune systems in addition to their disabilities. Some individuals decided to exit the program without accomplishing their employment goal because of concerns about exposure to COVID-19. This also adversely impacted KPM #17. We are also serving more clients with intellectual and developmental disabilities as a result of the Lane v. Brown Settlement. More resources have been used to place the most significantly disabled individuals within our state and that has impacted the program. actual target 2023-25 Ways and Means Page|35 Oregon Department of Human Services Key Performance MeasureWe are working to improve placement opportunities by engaging in employers more than what is required by WIOA, including increased training for potential employers. VR meets with Office of Developmental Disabilities Services (ODDS) every month to plan and coordinate services to improve outcomes for this population. Together, we continue to develop resources to improve on the service delivery model. 2023-25 Ways and Means Page|36 Oregon Department of Human Services Key Performance MeasureKPM #18OVRS CONSUMERS EMPLOYED IN SECOND QUARTER FOLLOWING PROGRAM EXIT - The percentage of OVRS clients closed from plan who are employed during second quarter following program exit Data Collection Period: Oct 01 - Sep 30 * Upward Trend = positive result Report Year 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 EMPLOYMENT IN SECOND 52% 52% 52% 52% How Are We Doing From Oct. 1, 2020 to Sept. 30, 2021, the most recent period for which all relevant data is available, 52.9% of individuals exited from OVRS services were employed during the second quarter following exit. This is roughly a half percentage point higher retention rate than the previous year. Staff are working toward more effective career counseling and guidance in this post-pandemic environment to ensure employment longevity for our clients. The program is working to emphasize non-technical employment skills, such as soft skills, to improve client employment retention. Factors Affecting Results Considering the lingering impact from the COVID-19 pandemic and the disruption to the state's workforce, this is a more positive outcome than expected. At the height of the pandemic, the state lost 285,500 nonfarm payroll jobs, a 14.5% drop, as the unemployment rate skyrocketed by nearly 10 percentage points to a record-high 13.2%. As a result, many OVRS clients lost their employment or had greatly reduced hours impacting KPM #18. Successful employment depends on the skills, character, and needs of each client and employer. This variability can impact KPM #18 outcomes since each person and organization is different. In addition, local, state, national and global economic factors such as work location and availability of workforce supports can affect how successful a client is able to retain employment. actual target 2023-25 Ways and Means Page|37 Oregon Department of Human Services Key Performance MeasureKPM #19OVRS CONSUMERS EMPLOYED IN FOURTH QUARTER FOLLOWING PROGRAM EXIT - The percentage of OVRS clients closed from plan who are employed during fourth quarter following program exit Data Collection Period: Oct 01 - Sep 30 * Upward Trend = positive result Report Year 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 EMPLOYMENT IN FOURTH 52% 52% 52% 52% How Are We Doing From Oct. 1, 2020 to Sept. 30, 2021, the most recent period for which all relevant data is available, 51.1% of individuals exited from OVRS services were employed during the second quarter following exit.

This is $438 increase compared to the same metric in 2021. We are continually working to increase both the hourly wage and the total hours worked per quarter for clients by teaching technical and soft skills for maintaining and advancing in employment. We are also incorporating labor market research to identify high and true wage employment opportunities that match our client's skills and interests. This research will be incorporated into the comprehensive career counseling we provide.

In the Summer 2022, SSP conducted a statewide survey of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participants who applied or reapplied for SNAP or other SSP programs in the month of April 2022. The survey was voluntary and deployed in six languages: Arabic, Russian, Somali, Spanish, Vietnamese, and English. Of 22,750 SNAP applicants in April 2022, there were 1,785 survey respondents which represents a 7.8 percent overall response rate. Respondents rated overall satisfaction with services at 89.5%.

American Indian/Alaskan Native children are experiencing the highest rates of disproportionality, meaning Child Welfare is more likely to remove Native children than any other racial or ethnic group. Black and African American children and young adults are nearly twice as likely to be removed as white children. Not only are they more likely to experience a foster care episode, but these children and young adults experience a much longer average length of stay than any other race. Location and lack of access to important services and community organizations can be contributing factors to an increase in disproportionality, as well as the practice and decisions that occur during an investigation. As this is still a relatively new KPM it will require further vetting and refinement, with the continuing goals of disaggregating further by location, age, decision point, and other elements to ensure an equity-based approach to this measurement. 2023-25 Ways and Means Page|43 Oregon Department of Human Services Key Performance Measure PLACE HOLD ER Due to the timing of the release of GB, details were not available 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |1 Oregon Department of Human Services Audit Response Report Oregon Department of Human Services AUDIT RESPONSE REPORT 1.

During FY21, the SFR unit has reviewed/updated every year- end procedure, including accruals, by going through them as a team so everyone understands the process and what to review. The Office of Financial Services has also put together a group from multiple financial units to document the financial processes of each program within the sub- systems, so everyone understands the impacts and needs for accruals. This document includes the financial transactions throughout each step of the process and the year -end financial process. We expect to continue this until all programs are completed. Lastly, we have created an accrual template for the program areas that provide the accrual estimates to use in order to clarify our needs. Recommend department management provide additional coding elements related to expenditure data to allow for identification of fed eral expenditures within the dataset and implement processes and procedures to ensure data reports accurately reflect case status and activity of the reporting period. As of April 28, 2022, the business change request was approved and additional coding ele ments added to the expenditure data for the 2021 audit.

Internal controls have been strengthened and the Public Assistance Cost Allocation Plan Change Log for both DHS and OHA are reviewed on a monthly basis notating any change, the reason f or the change, and the plan part and section reference. The changes accumulated over the year are reviewed prior to the annual state fiscal year submission to the Federal Department of Health and Human Services Cost Allocation Services unit to ensure align ment between the Cost Allocation System and the federally approved plans. Recommend department and authority management strengthen controls to perform timely eligibility redeterminations and verification of client income and ensure eligible clients are appropriately enrolled in both Medicare and Medicaid. Additionally, we recommend management provide periodic training to caseworkers to reduce the risk of administrative errors. We also recommend management correct all identified issues and reimburse the f ederal agency for unallowable costs. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |4 Oregon Department of Human Services Audit Response Report The ONE system was implemented statewide on February 1, 2021. The ONE system requires that fields and screens be completed before an eligibility worker can advance in the system. Verifications are automated via interf aces when possible and must be reviewed. In addition, the ONE system contains a robust rule engine, and checks for correct program enrollment prior to the authorization of benefits. These systematic actions will support accurate and timely eligibility dete rminations now and into the future. Additionally, the IE system implementation includes cross policy, system and advanced policy training to support staff, eligibility workers and case managers statewide. We believe this training will also assist in ensuri ng we are building and developing an informed workforce with consistent knowledge of federal and state eligibility policies. All questioned costs have been adjusted as of December 31, 2020. Recommend department management review OR -Kids transaction processing and complete system modifications as appropriate to ensure proper financial reporting of program expenditures. We also recommend department management review prior year and current year transactions and reimburse the federal agency f or grant expenditures claimed inappropriately . Office of Financial Services (OFS) has developed and reviewed a process that allows us to report appropriately federal expenditures and identify the adjustments that are needed to release our federal partners from participating in expenditures that have since been reversed for various reasons. The process has been implemented as of March 2021. OFS has performed correcting entries that appropriately reflect federal funding for Appropriation Year 2021 through Ma rch 2021, as well as individual month of April 2021. This process will continue to be used on a go- forward basis. The IV -E questioned costs of $50,810 were corrected with document BT189872 (effective date August 11, 2020) and reported on the September 30, 2020, IV -E report. The Medicaid adjustment of $10,577 was 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |5 Oregon Department of Human Services Audit Response Report made with document number BT190147 (effective date August 30, 2020) and reported on line 10a in Q1 for FFY21, Audit Tracking number CIN A- 10-20-60714. Recommend department management continue to correct known applicable child eligibility data issues in OR-Kids to ensure data used to estimate the savings in state expenditures is complete and accurate. The three Adoption Assistance determinations with the wrong answer selection were corrected on February 14, 2020, to reflect the appropriate answer. FPR provided 'Applicable Child Only' guidance to IV-E specialists via email in March of 2020 to ensure that they understand how to complete an Adoption Agency determination accurately. The Adop tion Assistance determination batch process from case 2 to case 3 was corrected on JIRA 32928 and was released to production on April 1, 2020. The affected Adoption Assistance determinations were corrected and refinanced on JIRA 32926, 32934, and 33412. These all went into production on April 1, 2020. Adoption Report 3012 was fixed to correctly identify all eligible statuses for IV- E Adoption Assistance to include: applicable child, not applicable child, and applicable/not applicable child. The new report went into production on June 29, 2020. During Secretary of State follow -up in 2020, there was a display error identified that was caused by a field transferring incorrectly from case 2 to case 3. This error did not affect financing. A data fix was completed on January 27, 2021. Recommend department management review adequate support for administrative charges and revise the monitoring checklist to demonstrate that on-site monitoring of invoices is done. The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) - The Department is currently working with Food and Nutrition Services (FNS) partners to update three required monitoring tools for TEFAP and Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP). Per federal requirements the monitoring schedule for TEFAP is one annual sto rage facility review and one quadrennial comprehensive review of the sub- recipient agency, OFB. The Department will make corrections and updates to the current annual storage facility review tool per Food and Nutrition Services (FNS) and Secretary of State guidance to meet the 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |6 Oregon Department of Human Services Audit Response Report recommendation for documenting specific records reviewed during on site monitoring. The Department will create and implement a quadrennial comprehensive review tool with FNS guidance and partnership. The Department will receive FNS approval on the finalized monitoring tools. Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) - Per federal requirements the monitoring schedule for CSFP is to complete a biennial inventory and compliance review of the sub- recipient agency, OFB. The department wi ll continue to work with Food and Nutrition Services (FNS) to update and correct the biennial monitoring tool to reflect FNS and Secretary of State guidance to meet the recommendation for documenting specific records reviewed during on site monitoring. The Department will receive FNS approval on the finalized monitoring tools. Due to the C oronavirus pandemic , original timelines and reviews were adjusted. TEFAP - The monitoring tools have been completed and approved by FNS as of March 25, 2021. The Departme nt plans to conduct an onsite or virtual storage facility review by the end of FFY2021 or September 30, 2021. CSFP - The monitoring tools have been completed and approved by FNS as of March 25, 2021. The Department plans to conduct an onsite or virtual facility review by the end of FFY2021 or September 30, 2021. Corrective action was taken February 14, 2022. ODHS completed monitoring for TEFAP and CSFP using monitoring forms approved by FNS. ODHS submitted completed monitoring reports to SOS and received confirmation that the corrective action is considered complete. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |7 Oregon Department of Human Services Audit Response Report 2. ODHS: Oregon Should Improve Child Safety by Strengthening Child Care Background Checks and the State's Sex Offender Registry, audit #2020 -21 (dated June 2020) To ensure consistency and standardization, OCC and BCU propose legislation to have all childcare background checks performed by a single agency that conducts childcare provider background checks. Senate Bill 49 was introduced for legislative approval during the 2021 Legislative Session. If passed, ODHS will transfer all childcare provider background checks to Oregon Department of Education's Office of Child Care ( OCC ) by 2022. The bill was not passed through c ommittee. The legislation was updated and reintroduced in the 2022 session as HB4005 and SB1547. Both were enrolled with emergency clauses and sent to the Governor on March 8, 2022. The implementation due date is extended to July 1, 2022, as this request is in Senate Bill 49 awaiting legislative approval. In consultation with the Oregon Department of Justice, OCC and BCU should create a consistent list of automatic disqualifyi ng crimes to use in background check determinations for state licensed and regulated childcare providers, and periodically evaluate that list as criminal laws change. Agencies should seek clarification from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Child Care, as needed, for act requirements. Implementation will require collaboration between the DHS Background Check Unit (BCU), DHS Child Care Unit (CCU) and the Oregon Office of Child Care (OCC), and Oregon Department of Justice (DOJ) before proceeding to a Rules Advisory Committee (RAC) to publish permanent rules. Crime lists will be reviewed annually thereafter. ODHS is waiting on pending legislation to move the background checks over to OCC. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |8 Oregon Department of Human Services Audit Response Report Legislation was passed in the 2021 and 2022 sessions that will transfer all of these background checks to the Office of Child Care. That transfer will satisfy this recommendation. ODHS and OCC are partnering to execute a smooth transfer. OCC and BCU should w ork together to set the same background check requirements for all childcare providers that are at a high enough standard to protect the welfare of children. At a minimum, this should happen on a regular basis due to law changes and include determining other concerning crimes to consider, looking at trends or patterns of concerning behavior, timing of renewal and interim background checks, setting minimum age requirements, and reporting requirements. Implementation will require collaboration between BCU, CCU , OCC and DOJ before proceeding to RCA to publish permanent rules. Thereafter procedural and other documents will need to be updated and training on new processes provided to all pertinent BCU and OCC staff. Synchronization of practice and requirements will be reviewed annually thereafter to maintain quality control. Legislation was passed in the 2021 and 2022 sessions that will transfer all of these background checks to the Office of Child Care. That transfer will satisfy this recommendation. ODHS and OCC are partnering to execute a smooth transfer. Recommend OCC and BCU advocate to the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services Office of Child Care the need for interstate sharing of information critical in assessing childcare providers. Conversations and advoc acy for interstate data-sharing tools and processes between BCU, OCC, and the US Office of Child Care have been ongoing since early 2017. Oregon has participated in a variety of Region X teleconferences with US Office of Child Care and other states' licens ing and background check agencies, as well as state police departments working toward acquiring Federal statutory data -sharing authority, as well as Federally provided tools and applications. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |9 Oregon Department of Human Services Audit Response Report A workgroup between OCC/DELC and BCU was established and has bee n meeting since early 2021. Now that enabling legislation was passed in the 2022 Session, the workgroup will be determining the operational procedures necessary to enact the legislation, including implementation of these recommendations as remains appropri ate post-Session. Recommend OCC and BCU establish policies and procedures to share updated, pertinent information resulting from background checks on related individuals. BCU and OCC will collaborate with DOJ and Oregon State Police (OSP) to identify what information can be shared, and what processes for that sharing are legally sufficient. BCU and OCC will enact those recommendations for data -sharing as applicable. A workgroup between OCC/DELC and BCU was established and has been meeting sinc e early 2021. Now that enabling legislation was passed in the 2022 Session, the workgroup will be determining the operational procedures necessary to enact the legislation, including implementation of these recommendations as remains appropriate post-Session. Recommend OCC and BCU check the provider's address with Oregon's sex offender registry when conducting background check procedures on a provider whose home is where childcare is provided. ODHS Child Care Policy along with Shared Services Background Che ck Unit (BCU), Oregon State Police (OSP) and Office of Child Care (OCC) is currently solidifying a business process to cross match childcare provider addresses to OSP's Sex Offender Registry (SOR) on a monthly basis. A business process is being developed by the Office of Information Services (OIS) to create an electronic transfer file that will be sent to OSP monthly listing current approved ODHS license -exempt provider addresses to compare with OSP's SOR database system. OSP will return via electronic file any \"hits\" matching SOR addresses to license -exempt approved childcare providers. BCU will receive the 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |10 Oregon Department of Human Services Audit Response Report information and gather necessary information to report any matches to Oregon Reporting Child Abuse Hotline (ORCAH) to screen and assign an investigation if appropriate. Recommend DHS work with OCC to regularly provide OCC with adult protective services reports. It is important to note that APD (in coordination with other DHS/OHA programs) implemented a new Centralized Abuse Management (CAM) System. All APD or Area Agency on Aging (AAA) offices were operational in CAM as of Jan. 1, 2019. Our gatekeeper coordinates with respective contacts in SOQ and APD to ensure all relevant systems (legacy, CAM) are queried for pertinent information to ensure a comprehensive review is completed. DHS (including APD-APS, SOQ and the OTIS) will continue working with OCC to develop a process for sharing information necessary for OCC to perform their background checks. APD has agreed to provide the OCC with APS ab use history and are doing so upon request, per the process described in the previous update. APD has pointed the OCC to the Data-Warehouse (DW) for direct access to data to help streamline the process. There is also a process set up with the Office of Safety, Oversight and Quality (SOQ). Recommend DHS have common identifiers within its abuse and neglect registries that are reliable and can be used to readily identify a person involved in a protective service allegation. DHS should collect and work with OCC to also collect those identifiers for all childcare providers. This will allow a more complete check of abuse and neglect registries. DHS Aging and People with Disabilities (APD), in coordination with other DHS/OHA programs, implemented a new Centralized Abuse Management (CAM) System for Adult Protective Services (APS). All APD or Area Agency on Aging (AAA) offices were operational in CAM as of Jan uary 1, 2019. In addition, the Safety Oversight and Quality Office (SOQ) implemented a new Corrective Action and 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |11 Oregon Department of Human Services Audit Response Report Licensing Management System (CALMS) as of February 18, 2020. CALMS imports information/records from CAM to SOQ that enables them to perform Licensing and Corrective Action tasks. In each system, several common identifiers exist to identify a person inv olved in an APS investigations and SOQ corrective action. Examples include: 1. Each intake or investigation is assigned a CAM/CALMS identification number as a unique identifier. 2. CAM has a global search feature that allows a user to search for an individual and any role they had in an APS intake or investigation. The roles include alleged victim, alleged perpetrator, reporter, witness, collateral contact, etc. This is another identification source that can be utilized. 3. Each individual involved in an APS intake or investigation has a unique person record created in CAM that contains identifiers such as name, alias, date of birth (DOB), address, Social Security Number (SSN), as available. A person record must be created before an intake or investigation can be assigned or closed. APD and OTIS recognize that DOB or SSN information is not always available. It is important to note, APS is not an eligibility -based program that requires this type of identification. Investigation parties have the right to decline APS interventions and asking for this type of identification during a case of familial type abuse could create a safety risk for a vulnerable adult. Whenever possible, this information is included in the CAM/CALMS system or provided via other so urces such as through SOQ for licensed providers. Currently, a data analysis query is being conducted by the APS Unit, QA/QI Coordinator to determine data trends for SSN and DOB numbers for both Community and Facility APS settings. The data analysis will b e shared with Field Administration and respective offices for a quality improvement plan. Early results from the data query show a modest improvement in this area of data collection. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |12 Oregon Department of Human Services Audit Response Report OTIS investigations similarly are using CAM and will review data capture for these common identifiers. Child Welfare (CW) consistently requests identifying information, such as name, DOB, address and SSN numbers. Like APS, child protective services (CPS) is not an eligibility -based program that requires this type of identificat ion. Case participants have the right to decline providing this type of information during the investigation phase and even when a case is opened for services. When the information is available, it is added to the CW case record and is searchable. CW and OTIS have developed business processes that facilitate the entry of OTIS investigations into the OR-Kids system for enhanced tracking of perpetrators and individuals involved in investigations. In terms of working with OCC to collect common identifiers, there are notable privacy and security issues with gathering and storing sensitive information such as SSNs. Establishing data- sharing with DHS protective services for OCC -collected Employment Identification Numbers (EINs) or Social Security Numbers (SSN s), and other common identifiers would require review by DOJ to establish what could be requested and shared between parties while remaining legally sufficient. Secure methods of sharing the information would need to be implemented. Data- sharing would also need to include data integrity procedures to ensure that fraudulent or incorrect information (ex., incorrect SSNs) was not being added to protective service records. Likewise, even correct information would need to be cross matched accurately to the corre ct APS or CPS files. Erroneous or incorrectl y matched information could create false negatives or false positives that would erode the integrity of the background check process as well as protective service records. OTIS: The OR -Kids Provider number satisf ies the recommendation. When OTIS submits a cross -report to OCC, they provide an OR-KIDS Provider number. OCC has access to OR-Kids to be able to reference details about the provider. OCC issues each provider a separate identifier (License Number) for their own system. The OR -Kids provider number would be the go -to since OTIS assigns provider numbers to illegal 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |13 Oregon Department of Human Services Audit Response Report daycares and people that are only receiving subsidies from DHS Self- Sufficiency. Giving OCC access to OR-Kids and referencing the OR-Kids provider n umber rectifies this recommendation, agree to move to implementation status. APD: APD has agreed to provide the OCC with APS abuse history and are doing so upon request. APD has pointed the OCC to the Data-Warehouse (DW) for direct access to data to help streamline the process. There is also a process set up with the Office of Safety, Oversight and Quality (SOQ). We believe this process rectifies this recommendation, agree to move to implementation status. The intent of having enough information for OCC to do a complete background check based on work we do and work they do is being met. Recommend DHS regularly check department employees for criminal convictions and involvement in founded abuse and neglect allegations. ODHS has implemented a process whereby the agency conducts criminal background checks for employees new to the agency upon employee transfers, promotions and re -employments. In addition, the ODHS Background Check Unit receives notification from law enforce ment and the courts when a ODHS employee is arrested or charged upon which time the employee is required to complete a criminal background check. 3. ODHS: Oregon Can More Effectively Use Family Services to Limit Foster Care and Keep Children Safely at Home, audit #2020 -26 (dated July 2020) Establish collaboration protocols with partner divisions and agencies that set common goals, procedures, and timelines for action on Child Welfare referrals and at the front end of open cases. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |14 Oregon Department of Human Services Audit Response Report DHS Child Welfare has al ready begun this work with the Office of Developmental Disabilities Services, working with the young people in foster care who experience temporary lodging. DHS Child Welfare will continue the work of identifying additional opportunities to develop collaboration protocols to set common goals, procedures, and timelines for action on Child Welfare referrals. Use data analysis and input from staff, parents, and other stakeholders to identify the types of services and providers that are most successful and cost -efficient, including alternatives for improving front-end family engagement, service coordination, and safety services. a. Provide ORRAI with enough capacity to credibly evaluate service outcomes and staffing needs, identify the most effective services, and conduct outreach to help districts improve performance management. The Office of Reporting, Research, Analytics and Implementation (ORRAI) will first need to determine if there is enough data for an evaluation, then complete program evaluation/service effectiveness for each program/service. The second step will be to automate the evaluation and determine the population best served by the program. The final step is running the models by individual/family to determine the most appropriate program/service for optimal outcome. Partners will be included to provide information about program, data, focused services, etc. This is a multi -phased effort that begins with service effectiveness through program evaluation and service matching and will requir e automation to be effective. The entire process would take 2 to 3 years if started immediately. It is also important to note that this recommendation is dependent on fiscal and staffing resources that are currently not available. Budget restrictions in th e wake of Covid -19 may require the target date for this recommendation to be adjuste d. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |15 Oregon Department of Human Services Audit Response Report Identify and implement alternatives to reduce caseworker workload. Potential alternatives include reducing time spent on data entry and other administrative activities a nd making case procedures more accessible and user friendly. In collaboration with partners, youth and parent mentors, Child Welfare has developed a new Family Report that significantly reduces workload to caseworkers. The new Family Report combines the ca se plan and reports to the juvenile court and legal parties, two very lengthy documents. The Child Welfare Policy Unit is currently analyzing the structure, accessibility and usefulness of the Child Welfare Procedure Manual. Since March 2020, Child Welfare has convened several workgroups that include field staff and central office policy staff, to document the business process flow for a journey through child welfare involvement. This information is being used to identify and inform procedural updates that create more efficiency in practice to then be reflected in the Procedure Manual. Revisions to the Child Welfare Procedure Manual are on track for implementation within the next year. Additionally, ODHS Child Welfare will analyze work assignments to caseworkers to determine whether there is opportunity for using case aides in a consistent manner . Develop contract measures at the district and central office level that set goals for provider timeliness, access, quality, and reporting of overall performance. Set clear performance management guidelines for contract administrators. The Child Welfare Contracts Team, in collaboration with district level contract administrators, will develop a charter or work agreement that establishes goals for consis tent quality, performance management and overall performance. Work with contracted providers to develop diverse delivery options that address service gaps in rural areas and other underserved areas, such as delivering services online or virtually when appropriate. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |16 Oregon Department of Human Services Audit Response Report DHS Child Welfare recognizes the benefits in delivering some services online and virtually especially in the wake of the COVID- 19 global pandemic. Ongoing, the Child Welfare Contracts Team will request contracted providers to consider enhancin g service delivery options that include implementing online or virtual options to address service gaps. It should also be noted that not all services are effective through online or virtual settings. Contracted providers and the clients they serve have varying degrees of access, skill, and infrastructure to support consistent and effective service provision and participation through online or virtual services. Work with OHA, CCOs and other stakeholders to quantify needs for mental health and addiction treatment services in underserved areas, ensure adequate coverage, and establish data sharing for CCO -provided services in Child Welfare cases. Also work with OHA to develop publicly reported CCO performance metrics that tie to Family First goals. The Oregon He alth Authority policy advisor to the Child Welfare Executive Leadership is convening a Medicaid/Child Welfare work group. That work group will be taking on implementing each component of this recommendation. Ensure that ORRAI's efforts to account for racial bias receive an independent review, either through peer - reviewed studies or commissioned experts. An abstract for the 2020 Annual Meeting of the Society of Risk Analysis has been submitted. Assuming abstract acceptance, a peer- reviewed manuscript would then be published in the Conference Proceedings. Additionally, the manuscript will be posted on the open-source journal repository, facilitating broad review and criticism of the developed procedures. Given the potentially slow pace of the peer- review process, it is anticipated to take up to two years to complete this process. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |17 Oregon Department of Human Services Audit Response Report Incorporate detailed information on services for CIRT team evaluation of CIRT cases, including whether key services within or outside Child Welfare were effective or available. The Child Fatality Prevention and Review Program will take immediate steps to incorporate changes to the case file summary template to prompt the gathering of detailed information about services provided by or out side the agency, and whether they were available and effective. In addition, service discussion will be added to the CIRT meeting agenda to ensure detailed information on services will be provided and discussed during the CIRT meeting. These changes can be implemented within the next few months. While availability of service is fairly simple to determine, determining effectiveness of services is nearly impossible to do without a robust program evaluation criterion. In Recommendation 2, ORRAI is identifying nearly 3 years needed to develop and implement a process that determines effective and cost- efficient services. Provide biennial reports to state leadership and policymakers on service access, availability, and effectiveness throughout the state, drawing on improved performance information. Child Welfare submits an Annual Progress and Services Report (APSR) to the Children's Bureau. The APSR is a narrative report on progress made towards meeting each goal and objective approved in the 5- Year Plan/Child and Family Services Plan (CFSP). It documents changes in goals and objectives and narrates a description of the services to be provided in the coming year, as well as other program information required by the federal Program Instruction. These reports are submitted to the Governor's office for approval prior to submission to Children's Bureau. Upon approval from the Children's Bureau, the report will be shared with key legislators on House and Senate Human services committees and posted to the DHS website. Incorporate the previous recommendations into development of the new five -year Family First prevention plan for ongoing inclusion in periodic Child and Family Services plans. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |18 Oregon Department of Human Services Audit Response Report While many of the recommendations will naturally contribute to the Family First prevention plan, the previous three recommendations are outside of the scope of the Federal Program Instructions for the Family First State Plan. The charter guiding the Family First Prevention Plan work addresses the remaining recommendations as part of i mplementation. 4. ODHS and OHA: Statewide Single Audit Including Selected Financial Accounts and Federal Awards for the Year Ended June 30, 2020, audit #2021- 13 (dated April 2021) Recommend management ensure transaction review is adequate and includes examination of proper and complete coding, accounting periods, and supporting documentation. The Office of Financial Services has reviewed and updated all year-end procedures and is engaged with staff for more accurate accrual data . Recommend management s trengthen year-end review procedures to ensure necessary system processing has occurred, and account balances are reasonable and properly classified. Year -end methodologies have been reviewed and we continue to engage closely with the staff providing year-end transaction details to educate on the importance of accurate estimates. The MMIS contractor has made the FMAP rate updates from 2020 at this time. Recommend the department's office of information services ensure systems used for preparing the ACF -199 and ACF -209 reports provide the coding elements necessary for accurate and complete reporting in compliance with requirements. We recommend program management ensure performance data reports submitted are complete and accurate. Policy and business analysts in partnership with system experts have continued to work through the ACF- 199 and ACF -209 federal instructions and system business requirements in ONE to ensure the data 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |19 Oregon Department of Human Services Audit Response Report reporting is complete and accurate. Through this process, work items have be en logged, prioritized, and implemented to make corrections in the system. This group will continue to review business requirements and submit work item requests as errors are identified. ODHS continues to review error reports from ACF on federal reports 199 and 209 quarterly submissions. ODHS logs system and /or report defects and continues to work with Deloitte on resolution to ensure accurate federal reporting. Recommend TANF program management ensure the work participation rate is calculated appropriate ly using verified and accurate participation data in adherence with the department's Work Verification Plan. We recommend program management review their system of controls and identify where improvements are needed to ensure compliance with the work verif ication plan. Policy has updated the JOBS Activity Guide (JAG) to align with the Work Verification Plan (WVP) and eliminate discrepancies. An updated WVP has been submitted to ACF, Oregon is awaiting approval. Changes made to the WVP allow for greater flex ibility in attendance reporting while adhering to the federal requirements. It is anticipated this will help increase accuracy. Policy in partnership with Design and Implementation will utilize a focus group of Engagement Specialists to identify the traini ng necessary in the field to ensure adherence. Focus groups will be completed by July of 2021. Focus group findings will guide policy, training , design and i mplementation around the specific training(s) to Engagement Specialists to serve as the subject mat ter experts at the local level. In addition, Engagement Specialists will provide support to Family Coaches and Case Aids to ensure documentation and hours entered are accurate. In addition to this the Self- Sufficiency Training Unit will launch new virtual training options specific to entering attendance, documentation, and plan building. Policy in partnership with district JOBS contract administrators will create a checklist for contractors who are responsible for obtaining and entering JOBS attendance into the system. The checklist will provide 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |20 Oregon Department of Human Services Audit Response Report instructions on documentation requirements t o ensure the documentation and hours entered are accurate. Policy will provide technical assistance to JOBS contractors along with district JOBS contract administrators to review and provide the checklist. The Engagement Specialist (ES) focus group began i n May 2021. Work began by creating a charter and identifying scope of work. Focus group was strategically paused through October 2021. The scope of the focus group shifted priorities to include the following: review information for ES positions, the skills, knowledge, and attributes for the position, ensuring alignment of the engagement model and completing a workload study. Work was not completed to identify the specific trainings needed to allow ES' to serve as subject matter experts and provide support to Family Coaches and Case Aides. Policy will conduct follow up by completing focus groups with Engagement Specialist and provide resources so they can serve as subject matter experts at the local level for both Family Coaches and Case Aides. A checklist f or contractors who are responsible for obtaining and entering JOBS attendance was created, and technical assistance was provided in December 2021. Recommend program management ensure client benefit payments are correctly calculated, paid on behalf of eligible individuals, and documentation is maintained to support eligibility decisions and benefit calculations. We also recommend program management correct the identified cases and reimburse the federal agency for any amounts claimed for ineligible cases. Oregon's new ONE system retains a record of applicants' agreement to cooperate with child support. It is a mandatory question in data collection, requiring that staff review the requirement with applicants and check yes, they agree or no, with the reason. ONE then determines appropriate eligibility. Currently, ONE screens have a mandatory field indicating the employability screening has been completed for those mandatory to meet the requirement. A change request has been submitted to add the employability screening questions directly into ONE as mandatory field. Until the change request is prioritized and 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |21 Oregon Department of Human Services Audit Response Report implemented, an operations process document has been created for staff which outlines the process to complete the form and upload into the ONE system. The ONE system reads the TANF time limits for each recipient and removes individuals from the grant once they meet the 60- month time limit. ONE appropriately determines the funding stream for individuals who have exceeded 60 federal months, no longer requi ring a manual funding adjustment by Office of Financial Services. Furthermore, when a hardship is granted in ONE, the system recognizes the hardship end date and removes the individual from the grant. ONE requires basic information for all household members, benefits cannot be authorized until all required information is provided, the system then determines the benefit amount based on entire household composition for no-adult cases. Targeted communication has been sent to field staff who determine eligibility explaining the minimum required information and the importance of ensuring all household members are added to the case. Policy will review the cases cited and make an appropriate referral to the Overpayment Recovery Unit, then the IE/JV subsystem will set up the overpayment and adjust the expenditures on the TANF federal grant based on the referral. Overpayments recouped can then be adjusted by Office of Financial Services and put back towards the TANF program rather than reimbursing, per instructions outlined in TANF- ACF -PI-2006 - 03. Per SOS auditor on April 29, 202 2, corrective action appears to be taken as there were no eligibility findings for the current year audit. With the implementation of the new eligibility system, ONE, the system determines eligibility and benefit calculations. Along with the implementation, SSTU provided both eligibility and system training to staff to ensure accurate information was entered into the system resulting in accurate benefit determination. Funding adjustments have not been verified as completed for federal amounts claimed for ineligible cases. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |22 Oregon Department of Human Services Audit Response Report Recommend program management ensure eligibility re -determinations are completed timely. Child Welfare reviewed and corrected the identified cases. This topic i s covered in initial training for all Federal Revenue Specialists. It has also been addressed in annual ongoing training summits and in direct communications to all Federal Revenue Specialists. The Eligibility Program Specialist is providing ongoing traini ng and support to all Federal Revenue Specialist staff. A reminder was sent out on April 26, 2021, to all Federal Revenue Specialists emphasizing the TANF anniversary determination requirements. As of March 2021, Child Welfare has implemented monthly eligibility reviews to help ensure that re - determinations are completed timely. Additionally, on May 12 , 2021, an eligibility procedure manual update was sent to all f ederal revenue specialists which included more emphasis around the 30- day requirement. Recommend department management strengthen existing controls by implementing procedures that include review of financial records supporting expenditures submitted for reimbursement. This recommendation has been completed. On e quarter each biennium, each subrecipient will submit all invoices and receipts for detailed review by APD. This has been communicated t o subrecipients by transmittal and new language has been added to all subrecipient contracts explaining this deliverable. Implementation of the process will continue through June 30, 2022, when all language will be in all contracts. Recommend department an d authority management strengthen controls to perform timely eligibility redeterminations and provide periodic training to caseworkers to reduce the risk of administrative errors. We also recommend management implement corrections in the ONE system to addr ess the weaknesses identified in verifying income. Management should also review the entire duration of the claim identified to determine if there are additional questioned costs from previous years. Additionally, management should reimburse the federal agency for unallowable costs. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |23 Oregon Department of Human Services Audit Response Report The Department is committed to providing timely benefits to only those individuals who are appropriately determined eligible. The D epartment has taken positive steps since 2016 to continuously improve and automate reporting capabilities for tracking and remediating untimely Medicaid redeterminations, including the successful implementation of the new Integrated Eligibility (IE) system, named \"ONE\" in February 2021. This new system provides improved client eligibilit y controls specifically related to timeliness of determinations, correct enrollment, automated notification of redeterminations and subsequently, actions to close eligibility if necessary, along with electronic retention of eligibility data elements such a s signed applications. With implementation of ONE and as we move the rest of the cases into ONE over the next year of redeterminations., we expect the errors associated with these areas to be reduced. The Department has collaborated across OHA and ODHS pro grams to develop a combined eligibility manual that incorporates all relevant policy and process for determining eligibility for the medical benefits contained in the IE system. This allows our eligibility workers and case managers in the local offices an upgraded tool and a singular resource that allows us to work collaboratively in our efforts to better serve and be good stewards to Oregonians. We anticipate releasing this in July 2021. In addition, new program and system training has been developed and deployed collaboratively across OHA and ODHS programs to ensure new and existing eligibility staff are trained sufficiently in the ONE system and all programs contained therein. The Department and authority are committed to providing training and guidance to staff to ensure information related to an eligibility determination, that is not captured by the ONE system, will be include in the individual's case record. The Department will review and update any existing training material as needed and send a commu nication to staff highlighting the importance of recording any information related to the eligibility decision, that is not already captured by ONE. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |24 Oregon Department of Human Services Audit Response Report The authority has submitted a change request to update the logic used by the ONE system to determine whethe r income information received by the Federal Data Services Hub is reasonably compatible with information contained within a case record. Additionally, the authority will review the identified individual's case and reimburse the federal agency for any quest ioned costs for the duration of the claim. Corrective actions have been implemented and reported March 2, 2022: Staff materials updated, communications sent and training and guidance provided: The combined eligibility manual that was updated can be found on the DHS forms: https://sharedsystems.dhsoha.state.or.us/DHSForms/Served/de2818.pdf Information about verifying and documenting income sent May 3, 2021 in a staff Weekly Update Attac hed All staff transmittal sent in March 2021 Income related trainings have been provided in July and December of 2021and recordings of these are still available online for staff: Recommend authority management strengthen controls to ensure documentation supporting a provider's eligibility determination and revalidation is retained. Additionally, we recommend management review the automated processes to ensure databases are checked timely. As of June 30, 2021, the s tate had addressed all exception noted and obtained the missing managing employee information, new disclosure statements or new enrollment agreements for all providers in the sample with one provider being inactivated who failed to respond. New enrollment agreements and provider disclosure documents for revalidating providers are now required. Since April 2019, the State has been running monthly missed validation reports for newly enrolled or revalidated providers to ensure missed validations are completed. Recommend department management review OR -Kids transaction processing and complete system modifications as appropriate to ensure proper financial reporting of program expenditures. We also 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |25 Oregon Department of Human Services Audit Response Report recommend department management review prior year and current yea r transactions and reimburse the federal agency for grant expenditures claimed inappropriately. Office of Financial Services (OFS) has developed and reviewed a process that allows us to report appropriately federal expenditures and identify the adjustments that are needed to release our federal partners from participating in expenditures that have since been reversed for various reasons. The process has been implemented as of March 2021. OFS has performed correcting entries that appropriately reflect feder al funding for appropriation year 2021 through March 2021, as well as the individual month of April 2021. This process will continue to be used on a go- forward basis. Questioned costs for Foster Care and TANF have been corrected with document BTCL9104 entered on April 12, 2021. The adjustments are being reported on Q3 of FFY2021. Recommend department management ensure a client's monthly copay and childcare hours are correctly calculated, and provider addresses are updated timely. In addition, in situation s with multiple providers, the department should seek reimbursement from a client when the client copay is not met as the primary provider did not provide care. We also recommend department management reimburse the federal agency for unallowable costs. ODHS agrees with this recommendation and plans on the following corrective actions. o Child Care Program will issue a policy transmittal to all staff determining ERDC eligibility providing information on the importance of calculating both childcare hours and copay correctly based on current Family Service Guide's instruction. o Direct Pay Unit (DPU) manager and lead will provide a refresher training to DPU representatives to update provider address information correctly. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |26 Oregon Department of Human Services Audit Response Report o DPU will review the uncollected copay report monthly to ensure processes are in place for copays to be collected each month. In addition, a refresher training for DPU representatives to issue billing forms with copays correctly. o Child Care Program will provide case findings information to the Office of Payment and Accuracy and Recovery (OPAR) for recoupment purposes. o Questioned costs of $10,241 was corrected with document BT195015 on May 11, 2021. Since the correction was backfilled with other qualifying expenditures of the same amount, the ag ency's federal reports remain unchanged and ACF will not see an actual refund . Recommend department management extend its retention policies for a sufficient length of time to ensure the department and auditors can verify federal awards are necessary and reasonable. In addition, the department should review all incentive payments made to providers to ensure duplicate payments have been identified and reimburse the federal agency for all improper costs. ODHS agrees with this recommendation and plans on the following corrective actions. o Provider log retention guidelines are aligned with Early Learning Department/Office of Child Care (ELD/OCC) for twelve months. Program will consult with lead agency ELD/OCC for consideration of extending provider log retention periods. o Direct Pay Unit (DPU) will identify all incentive duplicate payments sent to the Office of Payment Accuracy and Recovery (OPAR) for recoupment efforts. DPU manager will provide program a spread sheet of all over payment referrals sent from th e incentive payment program. o Questioned costs of $12,250 was corrected with document BT195015 on May 11, 2021. Since the correction was backfilled with other qualifying expenditures of the same amount, the agency's federal reports remain unchanged and ACF will not see an actual refund. o Incentive payments are no longer being done. All needed actions have been taken to resolve controls. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |27 Oregon Department of Human Services Audit Response Report Recommend department management implement controls to ensure actions listed in Oregon's CCDF State Plan are accurate and occurring. We also recommend department management timely investigate its fraud referral cases in order to recover improper payments. Child Care Program is requesting a quarterly report from the Fraud Investigations Unit (FIU) with status updates on fraud investigation involving childcare providers receiving subsidy payments on behalf of families eligible for ERDC (Employment Related Day Care) benefits and ensure appropriate referrals are sent to OPAR for recoupment of improper payments. Program is in conversations with FIU manager to plan meeting to further discuss the request and set a process. Recommend department management review policies and procedures surrounding documentation and approval of transactions, and provide additional staff training on processes involved, including verification of signature authority during the invoice review process. Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) Management agrees with the finding and will take the following corrective actions: a. Reviewing Delegated Signature Authority forms and delegation for all VR staff. b. Restructuring sub -delegations and updating form MSC 0286 for all VR staff. c. Train VR employees on policy and procedure related to Delegated Signature Authority. As of April 15, 2022, Vocational Reha bilitation has reviewed the Delegated Signature Authority forms and delegation for all staff. They have restructured sub- delegations and update d all MSC 0286 that needed a change. They have developed a draft training. They are working to finalize the training and expect to begin training in late June 2022. They expect training to be complete by October 2022. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |28 Oregon Department of Human Services Audit Response Report 5. ODHS: Developmental Disabilities Leadership is Proactively Addressing Program Challenges to Ensure Optimal Service Delivery , audit #2021- 24 (dated August 2021) Assign staff, either through staff re -assignment or a request from the Legislature, that would be dedicated to compl aint handling. The Office of Developmental Disabilities Services (ODDS ) will request a position to oversee this work during the 2023 -2025 legislative session. If approved, ODDS will move forward with hiring a staff to oversee the complaint process. ODDS will be mindful of the need for a dedicated position and will continue to assess opportunities to reassign staff in the meantime. The target date to complete implementation activities is Fall of 2023. Create written policies and procedures to address: a. Formal complaints as defined by administrative rules. b. All other inquiries that do not fall under the administrative rules definitions but are received by complaint staff. The Office of Developmental Disabilities Services (ODDS ) has initiated discussions regarding formal and informal complaints. ODDS will hold stakeholder calls and gather input and feedback prior to the summer of 2022 in order to file rule amendments. ODDS is also working with Office of Information and Security to adjust the database that holds complaint details. The adjustments will align with the recommendations such that formal complaints are clearly identified and non- complaints are filed and tracked separately. The target date to complete implementation activities is July of 2022. Train and make users aware of the complaint process and its purpose and value during the required case management contacts with individuals receiving services. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |29 Oregon Department of Human Services Audit Response Report The Office of Developmental Disabilities Services (ODDS) provides training to case management offices that request the training or when it is identified th at complaints are not being processed according to administrative rules. Following the rule amendments, ODDS will provide additional training related to the clarification of formal and informal complaints, expectations for case managers to discuss the opti on of filing complaints as well as how case management offices respond to complaints. The target date to complete implementation activities is September of 2022. Educate care providers about, and require case managers to discuss, ad hoc service hour increa ses with individuals during the annual review of rights and during the case management contacts with individuals to remind them of the opportunity to participate in meetings and advisory groups . The Office of Developmental Disabilities Services (ODDS) will add language to the Case Management rule requiring case managers to remind individuals of the opportunity to engage in advocacy at least annually, with the annual review of rights. ODDS will also continue to train case managers to review the individual's ability to request an exception for additional service hours to meet their assessed needs, including service hours to receive support during advocacy activities. ODDS will incorporate this requirement to discuss advocacy opportunities and supports needed f or individual to engage in advocacy to case managers training and will issue guidance to case managers and providers around this issue. The target date to complete implementation activities is January of 2023. Increase participation by individuals with I/D D and their families in advisory groups or agency meetings by providing consistent resources to improve accessibility for participating in process improvement such as: Accessibility for individuals to attend meetings such as transportation, Live streaming meetings with video recordings and captions, Increasing notification requirements, Varying times of day for meetings and providing support staff to help individuals ask questions and repeat information. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |30 Oregon Department of Human Services Audit Response Report Providing support staff to help individuals ask questions and repeat information. a. Individuals receiving services already have ability to use Medicaid funded transportation services to access advocacy activities, exceptions to increase benefit limits can be granted if there is additional need. With implementation of the new rate model for transportation in July 2022, ODDS hopes to increase provider capacity to provide transportation. Additionally, ODDS has requested to use a portion of ARPA funding to explore creative ways to access transportation resources in the community. ODDS will be working with transportation experts to explore creative types of transporta tion by the end of 2022. b. ODDS is exploring ways to make meetings more accessible in how they are structured, paced, facilitated and what types of supports can be provided during meetings (also including, but not limited to interpretation, live captioning, graphic facilitation, etc.). ODDS will expand these practices to enhance individuals and family member participation in meetings, work groups and other advocacy opportunities. c. ODDS will work, with stakeholder input, to develop ways to increase notification requirements, including providing advance notices and making notifications available in at least five major languages (and other modes upon request). d. ODDS has conducted some meetings during various times or by offering scheduling options, including lunch hours, or after work hours to accommodate individual and family schedules. ODDS will continue to expand this practice to accommodate varying schedules when engaging self-advocates and family members. e. Individuals have ability to use their paid support staff to support them during advocacy activities. The target date to complete implementation activities is the end of 2022. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |31 Oregon Department of Human Services Audit Response Report Engage directly with organizations dedicated to a diverse group of people to invite members to participate in ODDS committees and workgroups or when gathering input for process improvements. The Office of Developmental Disabilities Services (ODDS) is committed to community relationship development and included this as one of six priority areas in its Service Equity Plan. ODDS will continue and expand its community engagement efforts in collaboration with the Office of Equity and Multicultural Services (OEMS). ODDS is currently moving its Service Equity plan forward, and through this effort will identify and prioritize specific actions and pr ojects related to community engagement. ODDS is working to hire an ODDS Equity and Inclusion Manager, who will assist ODDS Leadership in spearheading the work to build direct relationships with diverse groups and engage them in providing ongoing input in t he policy making process. One example of the ongoing effort is ODDS' ongoing dialog with the Spanish Speaking Family leaders' group, Tribal outreach efforts and others. The target date to complete implementation activities is the end of 2022. 6. ODHS and OHA: Statewide Single Audit Including Selected Financial Accounts and Federal Awards for the Year Ended June 30, 2021, Audit #2022- 18 (dated Ju ly 2022) Recommend department management obtain a SOC report over the service organization's internal controls for the ONE application. Management should also ensure post implementation testing and QC reviews take place and determine if the overrides indicate an error in the application's processing. Additionally, we recommend management update review procedures to ensure year -end account balances are supported. The Oregon Department of Human Services will engage with our current open Request for Procurement for on -going Maintenance and Operations for the ONE system to ensure we hav e a SOC (System of Care) report provided regularly. Recommend department management ensure system requirements used to prepare the ACF -199 and ACF - 209 are appropriate to ensure compliance and implement review procedures to ensure performance data 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |32 Oregon Department of Human Services Audit Response Report reports submitted are complete and accurate. We also recommend department management obtain an annual SOC report over the service organization's internal controls for the ONE application. The Oregon Department of Human Services (ODHS) will develop a workgroup consisting of policy analysts, business analysts, OIS (Legacy) staff, and contracted Deloitte staff to complete a comprehensive analysis of the ONE system report requirements, code, an d federal instructions. The comprehensive analysis will identify areas within both the 199 and 209 where requirement and/or code are not in sync with the federal instructions. The workgroup will then conduct work to bring all three areas into sync to ensur e the ONE system is producing accurate and complete federal reports 199 and 209. Through this process the workgroup will test data and complete data analysis for validation. The Department is exploring ways to validate data at quarterly submissions. Once a solution is identified, a procedure will be implemented. ODHS and the ONE Maintenance and Operations (M&O) program are in a Request for Proposal (RFP) process to identify our IT service vendor(s) related to ONE, beginning July 2023. Related to this effor t, we are projecting annual SOC reports beginning in the 23- 25 biennium and are including these projections in our 2023 -2025 legislative Policy Option Package (POP) request. Recommend TANF program management ensure the work participation rate is calculate d appropriately using verified and accurate participation data in adherence to the department's Work Verification Plan. We also recommend program management review the system of controls and identify where improvements are needed to ensure compliance with the work verification plan. ODHS recently received approval from Administration for Children and Families for changes made to Oregon's Work Verification Plan. The Department is in the process of updating rules and guidance changing the way educational ac tivity hours can be documented and verified by allowing greater flexibility. The Department will continue to explore other options to allow greater flexibility in documenting and verifying attendance for countable activities. The Department will continue t o train staff 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |33 Oregon Department of Human Services Audit Response Report on attendance reporting requirements through biannual analyst hour sessions and individual sessions offered to districts specific to the trends in their area. The Department will also offer technical assistance to Case Aides who are responsib le for entering participation hours in TRACS. As stated in our response in a separate finding, titled 'Ensure performance data reports are complete and accurate,' ODHS will test data and complete data analysis for validation. This process will include the fields where work participation hours are reported. Recommend department management ensure verification of income with IEVS screens is clearly documented in client case files when determining client eligibility. It is also recommended management develop policies and procedures directing case workers to document their review of the IEVS screens in ONE, the new case management system. The Department is reviewing and revising the previously submitted Change Request (CR) to implement a system change to capture when staff are using the IEVS screens at eligibility determination. The previous CR has not been prioritized due to the level of effort (LOE). By revising the CR, the LOE will reduce while still meeting the needs of the Department. Until the CR is prioritized, the Department will update the Quick Reference Guide directing staff to document their review of the IEVS screens in ONE. A quarterly ONE system announcement reminding staff to check IEVS at eligibility determination and add a c ase note will be requested. The ODHS will also conduct training with staff regarding the IEVS requirements. Recommend department management implement procedures to ensure the accuracy of behavior rehabilitation service split rates entered into the system and reimburse the federal agency for unallowable costs. Treatment Services reviewed all contracts for the period under review to identify those with the incorrect AMSO (administration, maintenance, services, other expenses) split applied, and found that it was isolated to the BRS Proctor rate on 13 contracts. Corrections to the AMSO split in the OR-Kids database 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |34 Oregon Department of Human Services Audit Response Report were completed on or before March 9, 2022 , for all 13 contracts. The Office of Financial Services is processing corrections to refinance the errors in SFMA (Statewide Financial Management Application). Refinance is estimated to be completed by mid- May. Treatment Services implemented a new procedure effective April 25, 2022 , requiring secondary review and approval of all new or updated AMSO entries by the Assistant Program Manager. Review and approval of new or updated entries are saved in a shared drive. This unit also implemented a more thorough review of all current contracts on April 25, 2022 and April 26, 2022 , to ensure all AMSO split entry is accurate. Recommend department management ensure reviews of maintenance payment rates for continuing appropriateness are conducted timely and in compliance with department rules. The Foster Care and Youth Transitions Program has been notified of the finding and is in the process of determining how to integrate a consistent two -year review with their current plan for managing foster care rates. We anticipate having a procedure to report in the next several weeks. Recommend department management strengthen controls to ensure the long- term care facility's administrator compensation does not exceed the prorated maximum compensation limit for administrators who average less than 40 hours a week. We also recommend authority management strengthen controls to ensure evidence of review is maintained and readily available. ODHS - Aging and People with Disabilities (APD) Response: For the long -term care facility financial statement review audit deficiency findings, the ongoing corrective action plan is being implemented. The department is adding administrator hourly audit to the long -term care facility desk audit procedure. Additionally, the department will ensure the requested documentation is placed in a designated folder. 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |35 Oregon Department of Human Services Audit Response Report OHA - Hospital Unit Response: The action plan is to have cost reports and back up documentation stored on a common drive that selected OHA/HSD employees have access to on a regular basis. Recommend department management implement review processes and pro cedures to ensure manual calculations are complete and accurate. A review process and procedure were implemented, June 2022, to ensure the manual calculations are accurate and are in alignment with the source system data. In addition, the Office of Financ ial Services (OFS) is updating the automated process. Once the automated process is updated and validated, OFS will decommission the manual process. Questioned costs were corrected May 23, 2022 , under document BTCC6000 - BTCC6312. We recommend department and authority management strengthen review controls to ensure only allowable expenditures are charged to the Medicaid program. Additionally, we recommend the authority reimburse the federal agency for unallowable costs. The Office of Financial Services will continue to consult with and advise program on the need for accurate coding and review of vendor payments to ensure proper funding is used for the services provided. Questioned costs were corrected with documents BTCL4471 and BTCL4473 and appropriate amount was refunded to the federal agency. We recommend department and authority management strengthen controls to ensure documentation supporting a provider's eligibility determination and revalidation is retained and is complete. ODHS - Aging and People with Disabilities (APD) Response: 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |36 Oregon Department of Human Services Audit Response Report The Department's expectation to have a correctly completed and retained I -9 for homecare workers was reinforced by the department with APD and Area Agency on Aging (AAA) program managers , district managers, supervisors, and support staff responsible for completing I -9s in APD and AAA offices meetings held on April 13, 2022, May 10, 2022 , May 11, 2022 , and May 26, 2022 . The l ocal office staff were reminded of the legal requirement to corre ctly complete and retain the form and have it readily available for inspection. Local office staff were reminded of the resources available to assist with completing and retaining I -9s, particularly referencing the information memorandum issued in 2019 on how to correctly fill out an I -9 for homecare workers (APD- IM-19-062), the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services' Handbook for Employers (M -274) and referenced the information available on the case management tools webpage for APD/AAA staff. Additional ly, in August 2021, we implemented the process of uploading HCW provider applications, supporting documentation and renewals into EDMS as noted in APD -AR-21-039, which were previously maintained in paper files at the local office. This will assist with the finding and retention of records. ODHS - Intellectual/Developmental Disabilities Response: For a short -term solution, we are implementing a random sampling Quality Assurance by the Provider Enrollment team. Currently, there is a QA staff who is monitori ng agency enrollments, but we are having them also include Personal Support Worker items as well. Our current Fiscal Intermediary, Public Partnerships, are processing the I- 9s currently and we will go into their system to check for any missing items. We recommend department management implement a consistent process to verify branch offices are conducting required inventory and accurately completing inventory control logs. The Department agrees with the findings of the audit regarding non -compliance with EBT inventory control processes in 3 of the 17 field offices included in the review. The department will implement a statewide 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page |37 Oregon Department of Human Services Audit Response Report management strategy to monitor and verify compliance with required EBT card security and inventory control log requirements. The Department will use quarterly meetings for local offices to provide updates to executive leadership on district compliance or progress towar d meeting reporting and verification requirements. The Department will require each district to provide verification of compliance at least annually. The Department will develop and use a tracking tool to monitor compliance by district and branch. The D epartment will request verification sufficient to prove com pliance with EBT card security and controls. The Department's executive leadership will support communicating policy and process guidance in leadership meetings where the following leaders are present: Program Manager, District Manager, Administrative Sup port Specialist and Business Expert meetings. The Department will confirm that each district has sufficient protocols and assist with developing contingency planning to ensure EBT inventory compliance during staff absences or shortages. 2023-25 ODHS \u2014 Governor's Budget Policy Packages (POPs) POP # LC# All Program AreasOfficial Title (45 Character Limit)Description General Fund Other Funds Federal Funds Total Funds POS FTE 105 APD , IDD & OEPHealthier Oregon Program (HOP)Everyone in Oregon deserves access to the services they need, when they need them, to achieve well- being. More importantly, access to services needs to remain uninterrupted as people move through each stage of life and regardless of identity or place. Oregon Department of Human Services is requesting funding to provide long-term services and supports to eligible children and adults with disabilities regardless of their immigration status as directed by HB 3352, formerly called Cover All People and renamed \"Healthier Oregon\". This POP includes continuation of funding for population enrolled during 2022 through initial implementation of the program (ages 19 to 26 and 55+) and expansion of the services to the remainder of the age groups, including children, starting July 1, 2023. It also asks for ongoing funding for staff to help individuals access these services and supports, including case managers, and related staff who are critical to serving this population. $ 38,232,495 - $ 4,042,868 $ 42,275,363 48 36.50 106 Central Chief Data Office Accurate and reliable data can improve quality of life for the people we serve. Accurate and easily available data can direct services to where they are needed. Accurate data can offer solutions to problems. Data even have the ability to address inequities and disproportionalities, given the resources necessary to identify, gather and maintain them. Data inconsistency negatively and disproportionately impact people and communities of color, Tribal members and communities, people with disabilities and members of the LGBTQIA2S+ community. On the ground level, data give our case workers access to accurate information so they can spend more time in direct service to people. Currently one limited duration employee is the data expert for the Oregon Department of Human Services - a complex agency serving one in three Oregonians. This policy package creates a data office of three FTE and budget for contract services. The data office will: 1.Set and lead vision and standards for data collection, use, management, governance, ethics and justice. 2. Manage compliance with Open Data mandates (ORS 276A.350-276A.371). 3. Lead the development of tools and culture to enable ODHS to better use data to plan, make decisions and deliver service. 4. Implement data quality, management and integration practices to create the future of human services, reduce disproportionality and inequity, respond better to emergencies and disasters and adopt REALD/SOGIE (Race, Ethnicity, Language and Disability/Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Gender Expression) standards. If this POP is not funded, adverse effects include: first and foremost slow service delivery, missed opportunities to focus services where they are needed most and the perpetuation of health inequities. If not funded it will also adversely affect compliance with Open Data mandates; diminish the ability to identify and correct disproportionalities and inequities; and miss opportunities to streamline technology implementations due to continued siloed organization of data and related decision making. Lack of comprehensive data affects our ability to equitably serves Oregonians. $ 433,310 $- $ 288,873 $ 722,183 3 Central Ofc of Resiliency and Emergency Mgt StaffingThe Office of Resiliency and Emergency Management (OREM) provides disaster services to all Oregonians. OREM was created in response to the 2020 wildfires but its charge involves preparing for and responding to all types of emergencies, including the Cascadia Subduction Zone Earthquake, refugee crises, extreme weather events, and drought. OREM helps people be safe, resilient, and eventually self-sustaining. In the last two years OREM has responded to help people affected by excessive heat events, an ice storm, lack of safe drinking water, and a chemical leak. OREM has sheltered more than 4,400 wildfire survivors in over 60 hotels from Portland to Ashland; delivered more than 2 million hot meals, three times a day, seven days a week to wildfire survivors, sourced and delivered 500-gallon tanks to 200 people whose wells ran dry due to the recent drought in Klamath County; the list goes on. While Oregon Department of Human Services is identified in state statute as the primary agency for providing Mass Care during disasters, OREM has been operating without legislatively approved funding since the wildfires of September 2020. In order to fulfill our statutory responsibilities and help Oregonians successfully prepare for and recover from disasters, OREM is requesting additional funding. The funds will allow us to continue program operations while expanding our efforts to partner with communities, Tribes and community-based organizations to improve local disaster preparedness across the state. The policy package requests funding the existing staff to maintain as well as grow this essential program. $ 1,930,603 $ 1,446,210 $ 3,376,813 48 12.00 2023-25 Governor's Budget |1 Department of Human Services POP Tracker2023-25 ODHS \u2014 Governor's Budget Policy Packages (POPs) POP # LC# All Program AreasOfficial Title (45 Character Limit)Description General Fund Other Funds Federal Funds Total Funds POS FTE 118 CW Child Safety Children thrive when they have safe and supportive family structures in which to grow up. According to Oregon's May Child Welfare Progress Report, about 4,000 times every month Child Protective Services staff engage with families to identify whether children are being exposed to an unmanaged safety threat. Key ingredients in achieving our Child Welfare Division's Vision for Transformation are accurate assessments of child safety and in-home support to prevent placements away from family and community, but Child Welfare needs more staff to ensure that every family receives in-depth assessment and that safety threats are accurately identified. Current staffing levels make it difficult for staff to meaningfully engage with families, understand their specific needs, and develop customized safety plans - all tasks that require time, care, and skill. Without the staffing necessary to carry out these labor-intensive tasks, we may fail to identify safety issues and support families appropriately in addressing them, thus increasing the likelihood that a child will enter foster care - an often traumatizing outcome that disproportionately affects Black and Native American families. A staffing investment is necessary to meet the goal in the Oregon Caseload Ratio Standards that each CPS caseworker is assigned no more than 7 new assessments per month (1:7 ratio). The investment will ensure critical caseworker capacity for family engagement, assessment, safety planning, and ongoing support - helping to make sure that children have the best chance of growing up in a safe and nurturing family. $ 6,907,091 $- $ 2,302,362 $ 9,209,453 202 50.50 119 CW Parent Alcohol & Drug Support ServicesChildren do best when they grow up in a family within their community. However, substance use disorder (SUD) among parents is one of the greatest challenges to keeping children safe and healthy at home. This POP aligns with recommendations from the Oregon Alcohol and Drug Policy Commission that aim to reduce Oregon's substance use disorder rate and increase Oregon's recovery rate.It builds capacity for the agency to better respond to the growing complexity of substance use disorder (SUD) among child welfare parents and creates capacity for building more consistent and efficient relationships with community partners and SUD treatment providers. When parents in the ODHS child welfare system can access treatment quicker, be supported in achieving recovery, and be assisted in sustaining their recovery from addiction, there will be fewer foster placements and improved child safety and family stability. ODHS will also increase the internal expertise to respond to a variety of issues that combine with parental and adolescent SUD, including various mental health challenges and the need for clean and sober housing. This proposal will also grow expertise on drug testing, engaging parents and partners, and sustaining community treatment relationships that work with parents and adolescents. These positions will also provide ODHS with needed consultation regarding resource family applicants who may have SUD histories or current use concerns.

But children with complex needs are more likely to be placed outside their communities in order to receive specialized services. This proposal seeks to strengthen the well-being of Oregon families through intensive community-based support services for children with complex needs, allowing them to remain in their own communities in a resource home, relative care or parent's home. These services will provide coaching, training and support to caregivers and individualized services specific to the child's needs to help keep the child in stable, community-based and familial placements as well as reduce the risk of placement disruption, Temporary Lodging and the use of higher levels of care, including residential treatment. This proposal, if approved, will allow for services to be developed throughout the state, including in rural communities. In the long term, these services will prevent unnecessary foster care placements, support families, improve the retention of resource parents, and ultimately save the state money through effective early intervention and partnerships with other systems. The services included in this proposal are Child Specific Caregiver Services, Response and Support Network (RSN), Community-based supports for Commercial Sexually Exploited Children (CSEC) youth and Multidimensional Transition Services. This proposal requests funding and resources necessary to implement, oversee and audit these services. $ 7,292,700 $ - $ - $ 7,292,700 - - 123 CW FC/Resource Parent Reimbursement RatesAll children deserve to grow up in a family. If a child is not able to remain in their own home, we need resource families who are diverse and affirming and can provide the support a child needs within their communities. Resource families receive a monthly payment, but the rates for Foster Care have not been adjusted since 2018. In 2018, the rates were based on 56.5% of the cost of raising a child at the USDA rate. Cost of living and inflation rates have continued to climb. The rate is intended to cover costs of food, shelter, clothing, school supplies, extracurricular activities, etc. for children in ODHS foster care. Resource Families have voiced to ODHS that the current rate does not cover the actual cost of caring for a child. The policy option package would bring the basic family foster care rate up to 80%-100% of the cost of care to raise a child. The rate would change at each biennium to include regular inflation and additionally, medical, and professional inflation. This would allow for increases every biennium. Increasing the rates could help attract and retain more resource families and help current resource families cover the cost of care. $ 17,363,200 $ - $ 10,519,135 $ 27,882,335 - - 2023-25 Governor's Budget Page |2 Oregon Department of Human Services POP Tracker2023-25 ODHS \u2014 Governor's Budget Policy Packages (POPs) POP # LC# All Program AreasOfficial Title (45 Character Limit)Description General Fund Other Funds Federal Funds Total Funds POS FTE 126 10000-005 IDD Model Employer All people deserve equal access to employment opportunities that allow them to thrive as valued members of their communities. The state of Oregon is committed to fair employment practices and non-discrimination. Less than 1% of the state's workforce is comprised of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD), because this population faces common, disability-based barriers when trying to access state employment. The Model Employer program is designed to hire people with I/DD into state service. This policy option package (POP) requests dedicated full-time equivalent (FTE) for positions for the Model Employer program. Providing this opportunity for people with I/DD to have access to state employment by removing common barriers faced by people with I/DD in the state hiring process and incentivizing hiring managers to utilize this process will increase access to state employment for people with I/DD. $ 1,424,399 $ - $ 1,424,399 $ 2,848,798 29 16.38 128 10000-003 IDD Child Welfare and IDD Parents Our communities are stronger when parents are able to raise their children as independently as possible in their own or family homes. Parents with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD) have long faced overwhelming challenges and have endured discrimination, while being failed by various systems that are intended to support them to have full lives with their children and families in their communities. ODDS proposes a new set of innovative services intended to support parents with I/DD more effectively and keep families together. These new services, \"supported parenting\" would provide person-centered support for parents with I/DD to raise their children independently in their communities.

The Office of Developmental Disabilities Services (ODDS) lacks a centralized data system to manage the case management services and supports it provides to roughly 32,000 people across Oregon. ODDS seeks position authority and funding to secure a case management system, a universal provider portal, and a robust agency provider system to improve provider reporting capabilities and to replace ODDS' antiquated ASPEN system that will be shut down in one year. These system upgrades will improve ODDS' service delivery on many levels, some of which include communications, quality assurance, licensing, data collection and equitable access to case management services and supports. $ 711,758 $ - $ 6,410,420 $ 7,122,178 29 22.35 142 SSP OEP Combined Eligibility Worker We all want a state in which everyone can access the supports they need to thrive. In Oregon, the ONE eligibility system is key in making this a reality. As of May 2022, 1.5 million Oregonians access critical medical, food, cash, and child care benefits through the ONE system - representing a historic level of need triggered in large part by the COVID-19 pandemic. We need to make sure that ONE operations has the necessary resources to process applications and administer benefits in a timely manner, because people can't thrive when they are facing interruptions in their ability to see a doctor, choosing between paying bills or buying food, losing paid work in order to care for a child or are unable to afford necessities for their families. Since its initial launch in 2020, the Oregon Eligibility Partnership has made significant improvements to business practices and computer systems in order to boost efficiency and maximize existing staff resources. Still, we don't have the staffing levels necessary to make sure everyone who is eligible gets what they need when they need it. Without these resources, vulnerable Oregonians may experience longer delays in applications processing, delays that can mean the difference between going hungry and having enough food for their families. Additionally, local businesses may see decreases in consumer spending stemming from delays in getting Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits out to families, and parents may face interruptions in their employment due to lack of needed child care benefits. In this policy option package, Oregon Department of Human Services is requesting position authority and funding for additional eligibility staff who will answer calls, assist people in person who are applying for or receiving benefits, process applications on a timely basis, and provide support to community partners who assist people in applying for benefits. These resources will help move the ONE system toward its goal of processing applications same day/next day and ensure Oregonians' timely access to benefits. $ $- $ 51,728,451 300 300.00 2023-25 Governor's |3 Department of Human Services POP Tracker2023-25 ODHS \u2014 Governor's Budget Policy Packages (POPs) POP # LC# All Program AreasOfficial Title (45 Character Limit)Description General Fund Other Funds Federal Funds Total Funds POS FTE 143 SSP OEP ONE Ongoing Maintenance Oregon implemented the ONE system to help process eligibility applications for food, housing, cash, childcare and medical benefits for nearly 1.5 million Oregonians, the largest caseload in Oregon's history. With ONE we have created an opportunity for Oregonians to apply online, over the phone, through the mail or in person at any of our offices. Oregon has continued to invest in the ONE system since the initial release. But, like any system, there needs to be continued maintenance and then investment to meet the ever-changing needs of Oregonians and programs. The ONE system needs to continue to evolve our operating system to support a more integrated effort. ONE is a new system that individuals and community are still learning about. Engagement with community is critical to our success as we move from a siloed to an equality approach and then shift to an equity framework and person-centered, outcome-based system. Dedicated staffing is critical to connect with community and partners. Improved and sustainable ONE system operational support helps ensure constituents will see accurate and timely eligibility determinations, which will result in better access to basic food, health, cash, and childcare benefits in some of the most critical individual and family situations. This proposal would provide one-time funding for paying off the final deliverables from the contract related to the Integrated Eligibility Project, closing out the largest IT project's obligations from the history of Oregon. Funding would also support ongoing maintenance and operations services, staffing and service dollars for needed system modifications to more quickly meet consumers' needs, support training, system changes and building better equitable practices based on feedback we have had from partners across Oregon.

This policy option package will allow the state to meaningfully improve health outcomes in communities who face historic and contemporary injustices, in alignment with Oregon Health Authority's goal of eliminating health inequities by 2030. ODHS is responsible for determining eligibility for state medical services, for the operation and maintenance of the ONE eligibility system, and for the delivery of long-term services and supports related to Medicaid. This policy package would fund ODHS for related costs if OHA-HPA-05 is approved, which will enable the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) to execute and implement the policy and program changes outlined in 1115 Medicaid demonstration waiver and approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). These demonstrations occur within a specific time horizon and can be extended if necessary. This package would allow ODHS to fulfill the implementation obligation necessary to review eligibility as required by the waiver. OHA is currently negotiating the next five- year 1115 waiver with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and expects that negotiations will likely not conclude until September 30, 2022.

More than one million Oregonians count on the state's current mainframe platform to receive their benefit and provider payments. The COBOL programming code on the mainframe system dates to the 1970s and is increasingly unsupported. Mainframe-proficient staff are shrinking in number and hard to replace, resulting in a variety of service and payment bottlenecks. If these problems are not resolved, there is increasing risk that the agency will be unable to make timely payments to Oregonians, potentially for an extended period. Oregon Department of Human Services and the Oregon Health Authority are therefore jointly requesting the resources necessary to upgrade our mainframe platform and ensure continuity of payments and benefits for the people we serve.

Research indicates that quality child care has a significant and positive impact on children's brain development, setting the stage for success later in life. But disparities persist when it comes to accessing quality child care, with low-income families and families of color bearing most of the burden. We have a shared obligation to make sure that every child has the supports they need to reach their potential, and that means directly addressing this kind of disparity and promoting equitable access to child care for all families. Employment Related Day Care (ERDC) is a federal program, partially funded by the Child Care Development Block Grant (CCDG), that helps mitigate these disparities by providing low-income working families with child care subsidies. In Oregon, ERDC represents the largest child care subsidy program and was enhanced through House Bill 3073 (2021) which expanded program eligibility to include families with student parents and children who are documented. The ERDC program has also capped co-pays at no more than 7 percent of a family's income, as well as waived the co-pays of families at 100 percent of the federal poverty level to $0. To continue our progress toward addressing longstanding inequities, the Early Learning Division (ELD) is introducing legislation in the 2023 Legislative Session to ensure that children at risk of involvement or involved in Oregon's foster care and child welfare systems, children from families experiencing domestic violence, and houseless families have access to quality, affordable care. This expanded eligibility will allow more families to access critical child care supports, promoting both healthy development for children and uninterrupted employment for parents. $ - $ 4,892,534 $ 1,099,439 $ 5,991,973 - - TOTAL 217,162,520 773 Department of Human Services Page|5 POP Tracker2023-25 Ways and Means Oregon Department of Human Services 2023-25 Policy Package General Fund Other Funds Federal Funds Total Funds Pos.

One of the pillars of ODHS Equity North Star states: w e are dedicated to make services, supports and well - being accessible to all. Healthier Oregon program is an important equi ty milestone for long -term services a nd su pports (LTSS) in Oregon. Or egon has made significant gains in advancing health care coverage, with 94 percent of Oregonians covered. However, health inequities in coverage and access persist, and will continue to until all Oregonians are able to a ccess affordable health care, including access to long- term services and supports for older adults and people with disabilities. Communities of color are more likely to be uninsured, and the uninsured rate for Latino/Latina/Latinx Oregonians is twice the rate of the general population (12 percent compared to 6 percent) (Oregon Health Insurance Survey, 2019). COVID-19 has only worsened these inequities; Latino/Latina/Latin x Or egonians are 13 percent of the population but suffered 26 percent of COVID -19 cases. P rior to July 1, 2022, older adults, and individuals with disabilities, who due to their legal/immigration status in the United States do not qualify for Medicaid, could not access state, or federally funded long- term service sOregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 3 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 1 05 and supports . This created a barrier in Oregon that prevented certain populations from accessing needed supports, straining families, and the ability of family caregivers to earn a living while caring for the loved ones experiencing disabilities, destabilizing familie s, potentially leading to negative outcomes or crisis that had to be addressed through other costly and less appropriate settings, such as hospital emergency departments. Initial roll out of Healthier Oregon in July 2022 includes individuals ages 19- 25 and 55 and older and will cover both health care costs and access to LTSS programs administered by Aging and People with Disabilities (APD) and Office of Developmental Disabilities Services (ODDS) programs. In July 2023, ODHS is planning to add the remainin g age groups into services. Department of Administrative Services (DAS) and Legislative Fiscal Office (LFO) determined that the LTSS costs would not be in current service level, so this POP provides the funding to both maintain the services authorized in 2 021-2023 and expand LTSS to all potentially eligible populations . This POP also includes the costs tied to the increase in population and coverage for HOP that is part of the CSL within Oregon Health Authority ( OHA ). The expansion of HOP eligibility beyond these age groups will increase thousands of potential eligible individuals that will need eligibility done on initial application, renewals, support hearings and ongoing changes.

What would this policy package buy and how and when would it be implemented? Funding will be used to provide long term services and supports, including nursing facility care (for APD) and home and community-based services (for APD and ODDS), to all eligible individuals regardless of their immigration status (this will include individuals enrolled in Healthier Oregon and Cover All Kids) who qualify and need these services. Funding will also be used to ensure individuals enrolled through this program have access to case management services. Funding and position authority will be used to ensure we have staffing to determine eligibility, process applications, redeterminations, support requests around hearings and update cases. The support for these cases is critical to ensure we have on going work to meet State and Federal compliance standards and provide timely and accurate services. These resources will also be used to ensure that ODHS and its contracted partners have sufficient resources to operationalize the program, provide protecti ve services and respond to the additional administrative needs of new enrollment. These costs will be determined through workload models currently in place accounting for additional caseload through Healthier Oregon program. Resources will also be used to implement a robust communication campaign to promote program awareness, develop communication tools, and build partnerships with community organizations working with immigrant and refugee populations impacted by Healthier Oregon.

How does this policy package help, or potentially hinder, populations that disproportionately or underserved ? How does this policy package further ODHS 's 3 strategic goals, and both the program and ODHS mission s? Strengthening foundations Responding to emergencies Creating the future of human services The Healthier Oregon program significantly reduces disparities within Oregon that exist in access to health care and long-term services and supports for older adults and people with disabilities. By applying a universal design lens, this effort increases a ccess for everyone and eliminates intentional and unintentional segregation of certain groups. This effort lays the foundation for more equitable system s of support that will have long lasting positive impacts on both health and social outcomes for people affected by the program and for the entire population of Oregon. At the core of this process is an intentional shift towards inclusive and equitable culture that values all human life and benefits the entire community. Some of the extended benefits of th is program include helping families stay together; better emergency response when needed; improved health, education, and employment outcomes so that people with disabilities and their families can experience more stability, less trauma, and better lives. Additionally, this effort will lead to improved awareness of availability of supports to the whole community; building trust and better outreach with diverse communities across Oregon .

How will ODHS measur e the impact on system and access inequities and/or impact disproportionality in accessibility and services in ODHS programs through this policy package? Data will be collected in the same way it is gathered for Medicaid eligible population s through existing systems, enrollment and eligibility process es, prior -authorization and billing processes , and case management processes . Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 7 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 1 05 How achieved 6. What actions have occurred to resolve the issue prior to requesting a policy package? Based on SB 558, also known as Cover All Kids, starting January 1, 2018, the Oregon Health Plan (OHP) became available to more children and teens younger than 19, regardless of immigration status. This coverage did not include long-term services and supports. In 2021, the Oregon Legislature funde d HB 3352, formerly called Cover All People, and renamed \"Healthier Oregon,\" to ensure more Oregon adults can access comprehensive OHP benefits, including long -term services and supports. HB 3352 set a $100 million General Fund budget for the 2021- 2023 bi ennium. The vast majority of the funding will go to services, while a portion of that $100 million will go towards outreach, education, and engagement efforts, and administrative and system costs. OHA expects to draw down federal Medicaid match for the por tion of services that are allowable under federal rule, primarily for emergency services and services during pregnancy. There will be no Medicaid match for LTSS services. Beginning July 1, 2022, approximately 12,000 adults will transition to Healthier Or egon and the program will be open to new enrollments - this means that more than 12,000 people in Oregon will newly have access to full medical assistance. Hundreds of these adults will have access to long terms services and supports for the first time, al lowing them to remain comfortably in their homes and communities, and prevent costly and difficult emergency department visits and hospital stays. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 8 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 1 05 Even with this significant progress, children up to age 19 and adults 26-55 with disabilities will still be without coverage and disability related supports, for those who need them, with activities of daily living. OHA estimates that more than 55,000 people could become eligible for coverage under an expanded version of Healthier Oregon covering all ages in 202 3-2025. This total is an estimate of the number of individuals in Oregon who are 19 and older not eligible for Medicaid due to their immigration status, and whose income qualifies them for OHP benefits. ODHS is responsible to complete the applications for each of these individuals and determine their eligibility, provide notification of the decision around eligibility, support any hearing requests, and perform ongoing case maintenance for their eligibility along with annual redeterminations. In July 2019, ODDS opened a pilot project for interested Case Management entities to open case management services to intellectual and developmental disabilities ( I/DD ) eligible individuals who do not qualify for Medicaid due to their immigration status. Multnomah and B enton Counties piloted the program providing case management and resource referral supports to individuals with I/DD and their families. The pilot did not provide access to direct services and supports. Supports have proven to be successful and became more critical during the COVID- 19 pandemic in referring to vaccination and other resources. ODDS was in the planning process of expanding the pilot statewide when Healthier Oregon program became known. Effective July 1, 2022 , ODDS will open case management ser vices to all I/DD eligible individuals regardless of their legal status and Medicaid eligibility and will begin enrolling individuals within approved age brackets into direct services and supports through HOP. APD has not had legislative approval to prov ide the full long -term services and supports to individuals who do not qualify for Medicaid. Some individuals in Oregon Project Independence (OPI) are in that program because Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 9 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 1 05 of their legal status. Since the program does not require legal status documentation, it is hard to determine the actual numbers of people who could qualify for the expanded HOP. The Area Agencies on Aging (AAA) estimated that it is about 20 percent of the current OPI caseload. Additionally, OPI is primarily serving individuals ove r age 60, missing individuals with disabilities between the ages of 18 and 60. The numbers of individuals accessing the supports is also artificially compressed due to limited funding and large waitlists for OPI. Additionally, OPI provides in -home support s only. It does not provide coverage for nursing facilities or community -based care facilities. 7. What alternatives were considered and what were the reasons for rejecting them? ODDS is working to make case management services available to all individuals who meet I/DD eligibility criteria regardless of income and immigration status. However, granting access to full array of home and community services and supports to individuals who d o not qualify for Medicaid funding due to their immigration/legal status in the United States requires investment of General Fund resources. APD has few options. An expansion of OPI could be a possibility but if individuals are eligible for health benef its, they cannot access OPI services. Regardless of any program, providing the full array of home and community services and supports to individuals who do not qualify for Medicaid funding due to their immigration/legal status in the United States is only possible with an investment of General Fund resources. Without funding for eligibility staffing, there are few alternatives to evaluate. The agency continues to work with OHA on opportunities for greater automation; however, State workers are required to make the final determination of eligibility, contractors and others may collect some information, but the determination is the State's responsibility. The growth in caseload in 2023- 2025 requires additional staffing to avoid the already Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 10 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 1 05 long wait times o n phones and ensure that we can process and support individuals and families applying for these and other benefits. 8. What other agencies, programs , community partners or stakeholders are collaborating on this policy package? Healthier Or egon is a partnership effort between Oregon Health Authority and Oregon Department of Human Services (Aging and People with Disabilities Program (APD) and Office of Developmental Disabilities Services (ODDS)). OHA and ODHS are working closely with community partners on implementation of the Healthier Oregon. OHA: A critical component of HB 3352 is the establishment of an advisory work group to (1) advise OHA on eligibility restrictions due to the $100 million expenditure cap, and (2) to advise and assist OHA in the development of a statewide outreach, engagement, and education program with the goal of enrolling eligible individuals in CAP. The Advisory Work Group prioritized individuals 19- 25 and 55 and older for the first year of Healthier Oregon, identif ying individuals 55 and older due to significant health care and human service needs, including long term services and supports.

This includes case management entities, providers, Tribal partners, advocacy organizations, culturally specific groups and organizations, self-advocates and families receiving services. ODDS continues to work on trauma informed communication efforts both at State and local levels through Case Management Entities (CME), including outreach to culturally specific communities, community or ganizations that support immigrant and refugee populations, and other partners to increase awareness of home and community- based services and supports through I/DD program. Work with CMEs to build on existing local partnerships to disseminate information a bout the program. Develop and disseminate communication tools and information materials in multiple languages and modalities. APD will continue to work with community partners, local offices, and Area Agencies on Aging to inform them of the new benefits. Additionally, we will partner with OHA in their work with Community Based Organizations to ensure that those organizations and the people they represent understand the LTSS benefits. 9.

Data inconsistency negatively and disproportionately impact people and communities of color, Trib al members and communities , people with disab ilities and members of the LGBT QIA2S + commu nity. On the ground level, data give our case workers access to accurate information so they can s pend more time in direct service to people. Currently one limited duration employee is the data expert for the Oregon Department of Human Services - a complex agency serving one in three Oregonians.

If this POP is not funded, adverse effects includ e: first and foremost, slow service delivery, missed opportunities to focus services where they are ne eded most and the perpetuat ion of health inequities. If not funded it will also adversely affect compliance with Open Data mandates; diminish the ability to identify and correct disproportionalities and inequities; and miss opportunities to streamline technology implementations due to continued siloed organization of data and related decision making. Lack of comprehensive data affects our ability to equitably serve Oregonians. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 3 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 106 Purpose 1. Why does ODHS propose this policy package and what problem is ODHS trying to fix or solve? Data is an organization's most valuable asset after its people. This policy package begins to establish the foundation necessary to manage data as an asset and leverage it to better support the ODHS vision, including the ODHS Equity North Star, REALD/SOGIE data standards, and equity dashboards, as well as reducing inequitable outcomes, responding to emergencies and disasters, and creating the future of human services in Oregon. All of these goals require accurate and accessible data and a workforce that understands data and how to use it to make decisions, assess performance and focus service delivery where it is needed most. All services provided by ODHS require the agency to collect, store, protect, integrate, and use data. These services are all hampered by the siloed nature of the five main ODHS programs and the software applications that support their work, and by the absence of agency standards for data structure and classification. The agency faces significant challenges using and securing data across hundreds of systems while managing risks associated with access to data by internal and external users. Fundamental gaps exist across all disciplines of data governance and management. These gaps slow service delivery, miss opportunities to focus services where they are needed most and perpetuate health inequities. In addition to solving these problems, the agency needs to develop deeper understanding of its clients, the reasons they seek service, and how their use of agency services relate to one anothe r. This policy package will help ODHS integrate data to develop whole person, whole household views to enhance the possibility of delivering needed services and interventions earlier than they might otherwise. The policy package will enable increased workf orce Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 4 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 106 data literacy to promote and support data -informed planning, evaluation, and culturally responsive decision making across all areas of the agency, including where and how best to assign staff for greatest impact. 2. What would this policy package buy and how and when would it be implemented? This policy package establishes a new data office in the ODHS Director's Office. The purpose of this new program is to: Establish the staffing bandwidth and permanency to support this emerging discipline and achieve the work outlined in the bullets below. Currently this effort is a start- up with limited capacity from one limited duration employee . Create, implement, and continuously update a strategy to manage and leverage data as an asset, including what and how data is collected, managed, and used, who can access it and how, and how to integrate and enhance it to increase its value and utility to ODHS to improve outcomes and reduce inequities. Create a roadmap to mature agency data management and governance, including coordinating available resources and data -related activities throughout the agency and in the Office of Information Services to leverage those existing resources to all, contributing toward one shared vision. Promote interoperability of data and manage lineage of data as it moves through and is shared with systems other than the one in which it was initially collected. Develop agency standards for the classification and protection of personally identifiable information (PII) and personal health i nformation (PHI), including when diverse datasets are merged by public users. Promote and manage data sharing among public agencies and other partners. Lead a change management program to provide data to employees in a usable format, for example ., in a sel f- service environment that supports data analysis, and to create a data literate workforce whose first question is, \"What does the data tell us?\" Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 5 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 106 Inventory and publish datasets, including establishing a process to engage with customers and the public to prioritize datasets for publication, through the Oregon Open Data portal as required by ORS 276A.350 to 276A.371 . Establish and maintain data governance as required by the State of Oregon Data Strategy and ORS 276A.350 to 276A.371 . The agency will begin re cruitment for the three FTE in the policy proposal upon approval with the goal of filling all positions by January 2024. Professional services consulting will be retained in late 2024 or early 2025. 3. How does this policy package help, or potentially hinder populations that are disproportionately underserved? How does this policy package further ODHS 's three strategic goals for both the program and ODHS mission s? Data is foundational to all work done by the agency. Like a telephone line to a local office that enables clients to communicate with a case worker for any reason, better data management practices enable the agency to have more and better information to integrate and study for insights about how to best deliver what services to which clients \u2014 regardless of how those might change in time. This policy package supports more accurate reports and better access to data by our partners, including Tribal governments. Better data management and governance as enabled by this policy package is a \"force multiplier,\" for example , it creates unpredictable efficiencies and insights that improve overall program performance and community engagement opportunities. By improving the integrity and consistency of data collected and managed by ODHS, disproportionately and underserved populations benefit in several ways: 1) reducing the quantity of missing data improves the agency's ability to focus support to those in greatest need; 2) increasing access to usable, correct and complete data provides a more accurate reflection of the location and needs of underserved populations which, in turn, enables the agency to allocate resources more Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 6 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 106 specifically to offer support to those populations; and 3) creates opportunities for more impactful collaboration with community members in data collection, analysis and reporting. Quantifying results 4. What are the long -term desired outcomes? This policy proposal is anticipated to provide multiple beneficial outcomes, including: More efficient and accurate reporting of required information to federal regulators and state partners. Improved views of client information. Enhanced credibility of information provided by the agency to external so urces, including the L egislature, community partners, T ribes, the media, and the general public Improved customer service . Increased efficiency and productivity. Improved transparency in data -related decision making . Increased collaboration with community members in developing strategic direction for collection and use of data. Data consistency, which will improve technology solution sets and the ability to convert or transfer data between systems, including improved classification of information as persona lly identifiable (PII) or personal health information (PHI) across systems as a result of improved data lineage mapping. Improved data literacy of and informed decision making by ODHS staff . More accurate reporting that is consistent over time . Ensuring c ompliance with HB2134 and and SOGI(E) data . Ensuring ODHS compliance with DAS Data Governance Policy . Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 7 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 106 Ensuring ODHS compliance with Oregon's Data Strategy. Ensuring ODHS compliance with Oregon's Open Data Standard . This investment also seeks to address inequitable outcomes: Improvements to ODHS's ability to manage data will have a direct positive impact on people's health and well- being. Accurate information will enable case managers to develop holistic views of clients, trends and the relationship between services provided through different programs within the agency. ODHS anticipates the following cost savings: Increased staff efficiency from standardization and improved quality of data will reduce time spent locating or validating data that is missing or inconsistent. Faster response and reduced burden of responding to requests for information from public entities, federal and state partners, the public, community partners and the media . More reliable data modeling . More efficient data stores due to improved data lineage mapping and de -duplication of redundant data . 5. How will ODHS measure the impact on system and access inequities and/or impact disproportionality in accessibility and services in ODHS progra ms through this policy package? Any improvements in service delivery outcomes will be indirectly improved by the investments in data management and use that will occur as a result of this policy package. In fact, the very ability to measure the impact of interventions to address inequities and disproportionalities is enabled by this policy package. Data inconsistency negatively impacts at-risk individuals disproportionately, which is most keenly seen in services for individuals and communities of color, Tr ibes, the disabled and those in the LGBTQ+ community. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 8 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 106 How achieved 6. What actions have occurred to resolve the issue prior to requesting a policy package? The ODHS Director's Office made a one -year, limited duration, appointment to scope the need for data management inside the agency and begin the effort to comply with the Open Data mandates imposed in ORS 276A.350 to 276A.371 . Data is an emerging field that requires dedicated resources to develop institutional knowledge and to propagate that knowledge throughout ODHS. One outcome is that this policy proposal is for a long-term structure to ensure that agency data i s managed to improve outcomes, advance equity, and increase operational effectiveness. Without funding to establish a permanent, small group to support data efforts, the challenges ODHS faces today with data will persist and will compromise the agency's ab ility to effectively serve its clients. 7. What alternatives were considered and what were the reasons for rejecting them? Continue with only one executive (a chief data officer) accountable for data within the agency. The agency has been using this model since February 1, 2022, with a limited duration appointment. This experience has demonstrated the need for a dedicated dat a function inside ODHS, and also that a data - knowledgeable team is required to effectively coordinate and leverage existing resources throughout the agency. One FTE is simply inadequate to support the strategic and operational tasks required of a data office at ODHS. Eliminate the existing temporary data function. ODHS will be unable to comply with the Open Data mandates of ORS 276A.350 to 276A.371 and DAS data governance policies. The agency will never develop the capacity to become data -informed except on an ad hoc Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 9 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 106 basis depending on the curiosity and ability of interested staff, and the current data silos will not be transcended to achieve the insights necessary to support equity and other agency goals. Data practices will be ad hoc and not adhere to es tablished best practices. Create a data office of 5 FTE. Due to the size and complexity of the agency and its data, this might be the desired future state. However, because data is an emerging field and at ODHS is at the lowest stage of maturity, to try to in ject five FTE in a short time period is aggressive and risks partial failure. Both expert knowledge in the data team and general data understanding among the workforce need to mature. In addition, a smaller data office forces collaboration with the OHA data management team, the ODHS|OHA Office of Information Services, and each program area, which advances the goal of creating a data informed culture inside ODHS and alignment across the enterprise; in other words, constraint will help us all to learn to gether and prevent the data office from getting too far ahead of its partners. 8. What other agencies, programs , community partners or stakeholders are collaborating on this policy package? Oregon Health Authority (OHA) and the ODHS|OHA Office of Information Services are key stakeholders of the ODHS Data Office proposed in this POP, but they are not directly collaborating on its contents, and OHA is independently submitting a policy proposal to enhance its data management capabilities and related needs within OIS to support data services required by both OHA and ODHS . 9. Does this policy package require any changes to existing statute(s) or require a new statute? If yes, identify the statute and the legislative concept. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 10 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 106 There is no associated LC. 10. What other state, Tribal, and/or local government agencies would be affected by this policy package ? How would they be affected? The data office created by this policy proposal will develop and manage a data sharing framework to grant other agencies and Tr ibes faster access to cleaner ODHS data while also improving security controls. 11. Is this policy package being requested because of an Oregon Secretary of State or internal audit? If so, provide further information. No. Staffing and fiscal impact Implementation date(s): January 1, 2024 End date (if applicable): n/a 12. What assumptions affect the pricing of this policy package ? Several key assumptions affect the pricing of this policy package: Collaboration with OHA and OIS will continue, allowing each to leverage the specific expertise of all data management knowledge across the three teams and thereby creating efficiencies for ODHS, OHA, and OIS. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 11 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 106 The role of this office will be strategic and advisory and will function in a consultative role with regard to technology projects but will not be directly responsible for developing or overseeing the data warehouses/data marts, or other technology operations. All ODHS program areas have subject matter experts available to operationalize the guidance provided by the data office and will be able to do so according to training and guidance provided by the data office and without direct operational intervention becoming necessary. 13. Will ther e be new responsibilities for another agency (OHA etc.) and/ or ODHS/OHA Shared Services ? Specify which programs and describe their new responsibilities. Because OHA and ODHS share ownership and access to some data, effective data governance will require collaboration between OHA and ODHS. OHA is submitting a POP to support their participation in this collaboration. Because data is stored in systems managed by the ODHS|OHA Office of Information Services (OIS), OIS will participate in data governance and management work and support related technology tools. At this time, the impact on responsibilities and staffing in OHA and OIS is indeterminate. 14. Will there be changes to client caseloads Cost per Case or services provided to population groups? Specify how m any in each relevant program. Cost per case can decrease when service staff are able to access accurate case data the first time, without having to contact the client to acquire missing information that had been previously provided but was lost or changed during a data interchange between systems. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 12 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 106 More complete demographic information and awareness of all services provided to a particular client or others in their household can reduce contact time and frequency as well as provide the opportunity for more e ffective allocation of services to populations that need it. 15. Describe the staff and positions needed to implement this policy package, including whether existing positions would be modified and /or new staff would be needed. # Class Title Class # Working Title # Months ( e.g., 6, 9, 12, 18, 24) 1 PEM F /Manager 3 X7193 Chief Data Officer 19 Converts existing LD position to permanent 2 OPA4 X0873 Data Coordinator 19 New position 3 OPA4 X0873 Data Coordinator 19 New position 16. What are the start -up and one -time costs ? Start -up costs are technology related equipment. While one of the requested positions is currently filled on a limited duration basis, and has already been provisioned with required technology, two of the positions are new and will require computers and peripherals as well as mobile phones. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 13 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 106 17. What are the ongoing costs? The only ongoing costs will be for compensation (salary and benefits) and mobile phone service for three permanent FTE. 18. What are the sources of fund ing and the funding split for each one? All funds required for this POP are cost allocated General, Other, and Federal funds. 19. What are the potential savings? In time, case worker efficiency will increase because case workers who have access to accurate information will be able to spend more time in direct service and less time in acquiring correct data \u2014whether done by having to ask the client to provide it agai n or by having to look for it in other places where it might be stored. As data is integrated and new insights about how services and conditions relate, the possibility of offering more appropriate services sooner will arise and potentially reduce the nee d for more costly interventions later. Time required to prepare reports will decrease, and the need to pay external contractors for some reports will end. From an IT perspective, accurate data inventories, database models, and data lineage tracking will support more efficient and faster IT systems changes and reduce billings from external consultants. It is also probable that data storage costs may be positively impacted over time as data redundancies are identified and reduced or eliminated. Storage costs overall will continue to rise as data is continually expanding year by year. Data security will be positively impacted due to improved data environment controls and better data privacy flagging. .

OREM was created in response to the 2020 wildfires, but its charge involves preparing for and responding to all types of emergen cies, including the Cascadia Subduction Zone Earthquake , refugee , extreme weather events , and drought . OREM helps people be safe, resilient, and eventually self -sustaining. In the last two years OREM has responded to help people affected by excessive heat events, an ice storm, lack of safe drinking water , and a chemical leak. O REM has sheltered more than 4,400 wildfire survivors in over 60 hotels from Portland to Ashland; delivered more than 2 million hot meals, three times a day, seven days a week to wildfire survivors, source d and delivered 500-gallon tanks to 200 people whose wells ran dry due to the recent drought in Klamath County ; the list goes on. While Oregon Department of Human Services is identified in state statute as the primary agency for providing Mass Care during disasters, OREM has been operating without legislatively approved funding since the wildfires of September 2020. To fulfill our statutory responsibiliti es and help Oregonians successfully prepare for and recover from disasters , OREM is requesting additional funding .

ODHS does not have a legislatively approved budget for the Office of Resilience and Emergency Management (OREM) existing staff. ODHS has been funding the existing OREM staff without legislative budget. ODHS needs OREM to achieve its legal obligations to provide mass care and disaster social services as required by the Oregon Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan. Please know that these staff are already hired and have been working in the OREM for more than one yea r. allow us to continue program operations while expanding our efforts to partner with communities, Tribes, and community -based organizations to improve local disaster preparedness across the state . The policy package requests fu nding the existing sta ff to maintain as well as grow this essential program. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 3 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 10 9 2. What would this policy package buy and how and when would it be implemented? Create legislative budget and authorities for the ODHS Office of Resilience and Emergency Management's personnel. The Office of Resilience and Emergency Management is working to support local communities by hiring staff from within those communities to work by, though and with local community -based organizations to embolden and to be more effective in preparedness and disaster response efforts. 3. How does this policy package help, or potentially hinder populations that are disproportionately underserved ? How does this policy package further ODHS 's three strategic goals for both the program and ODHS mission? Disasters disproportionately affect historically marginalized communities. Providing comprehensive and equity-based mass care and social services will help to ensure inequalities are alleviated in disaster mitigation, response, and recovery. a new take or perspective on a long -running, perplexing proble m in service delivery The OREM is being held as an example of how emergency management should evolve in Oregon and as an example of how other state agencies should address their Emergency Support Function responsibilities. Challenges assumptions or dominant cultural practices o The emergency management culture in Oregon has never before been tested as it has over the last two years. The OREM is demonstrating a bias toward action and assisting people who need help the most regardless of their living situation, income, or immigration status. Applies lessons from other fields Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 4 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 10 9 o The OREM staff is comprised of an extraordinary team with a vast array of experience a nd backgrounds. All of their experience in emergency management, social services, public service, private industry, law enforcement, legal practice and military service coalesce into a robust collection of perspective s and lived experience s. All these less ons shape the culture and operations of OREM within ODHS. Anticipates the ways an emerging trend will shape the future o OREM was created in response to the 2020 wildfires but is designed to be able to respond to the Cascadia Subduction Zone Earthquake. All other hazards and disasters are being carefully considered and prepared for in the most thorough means possible . Opens new opportunities for communities to leverage resources o The OREM works by, with and through local communities and comm unity -based organizations. For example, OREM has provided more than $ 18M to community-based organizations to support people recovering from wildfire s. Builds on community strengths o OREM works by, with and through local communities and community -based organizations. For example, during the COVID- 19 Omicron surge, OREM responded to a request from Multnomah County to establish an additional isolation and quarantine shelter when local capabilities were exceeded. OREM quickly established the shelter following MULTCO guidelines, operated the shelter, then demobilized it as soon as demand subsided to the level local resources were adequate. Strengthens community relationships Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 5 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 10 9 o OREM works by, with and through local communities and community -based organizations. Our regional staff members live in the communities they serve and maintain regular engagement with local partners, me eting them where they are at. Fosters Tribal sovereignty o OREM works closely with Tribal Nations to ensure participation and inclusion in each activity, exercise and preparedness measure conducted. Quantifying results 4. What are the long -term desired outcomes? The OREM has provided non -congregate shelter and three meals per day to more than 4,400 survivors of the 2020 wildfires. Many more people have been provided support from the many other disasters that have occurred in Oregon since September 2020. The office now has sufficient capacity not only on response and recovery but also on preparation as evidenced by our Able Readiness exercise series which is focused on the Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake. Outcomes will reflect that people who need emergency shelter, food and water receive it, local communities are more resilient and prepared for disaster and the OREM ca n effectively respond to any hazard that befalls people in Oregon. 5. How will ODHS measure the impact on system and access inequities and/or impact disproportionality in accessibility and services in ODHS programs through this policy package? Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 6 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 10 9 OREM collects and tracks data in a number of ways for a variety of missions. OREM employs a n ARC GIS specialist to maintain a multi-layered interactive map to track resources and efforts. Numbers and dollar amounts are constantly tracked in many ways. But most importantly, people served by OREM experience a more integrated approach to offering social services and are moved into a better state of life as a result. How achieved 6. What actions have occurred to resolve the issue prior to requesting a policy package? Currently, the entire cost of staff for the OREM is without a dedicated budget and with the formation of this entity in September of 2020 there were no available action s. 7. What alternatives were considered and what were the reasons for rejecting them? ODH S formed the OREM without budgeted positions beginning in September 2020. Since then, the long list of response and recovery activities conducted by the OREM has clearly demonstrated proof of concept and success of the program. Below is a list of some acco mplishments of the OREM staff during the past 19 months: Fire Related Operations: Administered and managed more than 4,400 wildfire survivors who were sheltered in over 60 hotels from Portland to Ashland (non-congregant shelter used due to the COVID-19 pandemic) . Built systems, procured equipment, and developed capabilities to coordinate disaster case management servic es. Worked with utility providers across the Pacific Northwest to establish protocols regarding Public Safety Power Shut Offs . Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 7 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 10 9 Conducted disaster case management of disaster survivors in Marion, Lane, Lincoln, Douglas, Jefferson, Multnomah, and Clackamas counties. Delivered more than 1 million hot meals to wildfire disaster survivors sheltered in hotels three times every day, seven days per week. Worked with private partners, CBOs, CAAs and COOs to provide support to and solutions for more than 4,000 wildfire disaster survivors, including converting hotels into apartments in response to a devastating housing crisis . Developed and released a Cleaner Air / Warming / Cooling Center Grant for local governments, Tribal Nations and Schools public buildings as required by Senate Bill 762 (Oregon 2021 Regular Session) and SB 1536 (2022 Regular Session) . COVID -19 Related Operations: Collaborated with OHA to support hospital decompression (non -congregant shelter used due to the COVID- 19 pandemic) . Stabilized workforce in ODHS Programs and OHA by establishing and operating a Stabilization Incident Management Team in response to the October 18, 2021, state employee vaccination requirement. Weather Related Operations: Sheltered vulnerable populations who lost power during the February 2021 Ice Storm in western Oregon. Sourced and delivered 500 -gallon potable water tanks to Klamath County to fight the drought and falling water table where more than r 200 residential wells have run dry . Provided support t o cooling shelters and homeless camps in Multnomah and Clackamas c ounties during the June 2020 Heat Dome event. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 8 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 10 9 Other Disaster Response or Preparedness Operations: Conducted tabletop exercises with partners such as OHA and private industry. Developed and established plans and protocols for Evacuation Assembly Points and conducted a f ull-scale exercise in January, 2022 of these capabilities. Responded to an anhydrous ammonia leak in Yamhill County near a facility for people who are aged or disabled. (Anhydrous ammonia is a gaseous or liquid form of ammonia that lacks water. It can cause chemical burns in a matter of seconds.) Managed in Oregon's largest FEMA reimbursement request for Mass Care expenses. Invested in equipment and strategies to make voice and data communications more resilient across ODHS, other state departments and local governments. Engaged the Nine Federally Recognized Tribes with an experienced Tribal Emergency Manager . Establishing arrangements to receive, house and care for Afghan refugees to be resettled. Worked with hundreds of private sector partners to develop sustainable and resourceful public -private partnerships. Provided emergency communications to a program office in Medford due to a catastrophic equipment failure exasperated by the current supply chain impacts. Assumed oversight of the 2- 1-1 program to better provide services to incident- impacted Oregonians. 8. What other agencies, programs, community partners or stakeholders are collaborating on this policy package? OREM works across state agencies, local governments, Tribal Nations, and other community partners to offer an integrated approach to mass care and disaster social services that builds on existing community strengths. Most counties lack formal capability to provide Mass Care following an incident because there are no dedicated local Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 9 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 10 9 government departments with that focus. Non- governmental organizations are critical to mass care delivery services, but none have a comprehensive focus nor capacity to address all hazards. 9. Does this policy package require any changes to existing statute(s) or require a new statute? If yes, identify the statute and the legislative concept. Not applicable. 10. What other state, tribal, and/or local government agencies would be affected by this policy package ? How would they be affected? Not applicable. 11. Is this policy package being requested because of an Oregon Secretary of State or internal audit? If so, provi de further information. Not applicable.

According to Oregon's May Child Welfare Progress Report, about 4,000 times every month Child Protective Services staff engage with families to identify whether childr en are being exposed to an unmanaged safety threat. Key ingredients in achieving our Child Welfare Division's Vision for Transformation are accurate assessments of child safety and in- home support to prevent placements away from family and community, but C hild Welfare needs more staff to ensure that every family receives in -depth assessment and that safety threats are accurately identified. Current staffing levels make it difficult for staff to meaningfully engage with families, understand their specific ne eds, and develop customized safety plans - all tasks that require time, care, and skill. Without the staffing necessary to carry out these labor -intensive tasks, we may fail to identify safety issues and support families appropriately in addressing them, t hus increasing the likelihood that a child will enter foster care - an often - traumatizing outcome that disproportionately affects Black and Native American families. A staffing investment is necessary to meet the goal in the Oregon Caseload Ratio Standards that each CPS caseworker is assigned no more than 7 new assessments per month (1:7 ratio).

ODHS Child Welfare has created the Oregon Caseload Ratio Standards (see Appendix A). Please refer to the attached document that lays out the history of caseworker caseloads in Or egon and outlines the process that was taken to create the current ratio goals, including the 1:7 ratio of new assignments for each Child Protective Services caseworker. caseworker capacity for family engagement, assessment, safety planning, and ongoing support - helping to make sure that children have the best chance of growing up in a safe and nurturing family. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 3 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 118 ODHS Child Welfare continues to improve upon practice, continually striving towards a person -centered approach from a values base in alignment with the Vision for Transformation. This shift in approach means that Child Welfare, as a whole, will need to adjust and pivot current practices to work toward intentional engagement with families, aligning with the Child Welfare Vision for Transformation : Guiding Principle 1 - Supporting families and promoting prevention as well as with the ODHS priority to stren gthen ODHS foundations . Child Protective Services (CPS) caseworkers conduct the initial contact with a family on behalf of the agency. Typically, at this initial contact, a thorough assessment is initiated to assess a parent/caregiver's ability to manage t he safety of their children. Child Welfare, like any other public, private, or non -profit / for -profit organization, is not immune to the current workforce crisis, resulting from the pandemic. These series of events have provided challenges that Child Welf are was able to overcome through creative, temporary solutions, like the use of the Mobile CPS Unit to assist in completing overdue assessments, however, these temporary solutions are not sustainable without additional staff. To ensure that we honor Guiding Principle 1 within the Vision for Transformation and work towards strengthening child welfare foundations, the need to request for additional CPS caseworker s and the supporting infrastructure is critical in building out the future of child safety within Child Welfare. Current data shows that an average of 165 assessments are assigned daily, Monday through Friday and an average of 50 assessments on Saturday and Sunday. Monthly, Child Welfare's child abuse hotline assigns an average of 4,000 assessments, including familial and third-party perpetrator assignments. Increased engagement with families at initial contact is shown to improve safety and well- being outcomes for children. In addition, timely and comprehensive assessments focused on engagement, trust, and the quality of assessment of services reduces the likelihood of future reports and future maltreatment. In addition to new assignments, there are current open assessments that need to be completed. In order to address that body of Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 4 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 118 work, Child Welfare is asking for mobile units of CPS workers and supervisors to travel across the state and support the work on the timely completion of assessments. To build out the infrastructure and meet the Oregon Caseload Ration Standards of the one to seven (1:7) new assessments per CPS caseworker, as well as create additional mobile units to support workforce in the timely completion of assessments and other time -limited situations, Child Welfare will need an additional 200 CPS caseworke rs, and the workforce to support and supervise those positions. 2. What would this policy package buy and how and when would it be implemented? ODHS Child Welfare is proposing additional CPS caseworkers (Social Service Specialist 1 / SSS1s ) to have the necessary and adequate staff to manage the work and intentionally engage with families from a person- centered approach. This POP is also seeking ad ditional staff to support other aspects of the work, while the caseworker is able to have more time to engage, assess the family, contact collaterals, and partners they are working with, and provide support and assistance with engaging in services that are needed to help families strengthen their ability to ensure their family remains safe. Child Welfare is requesting 200 SSS1s to be devoted to CPS work. Additional staff will be requested to support the SSS1s within the district such as Supervisors, Office Managers, SSA or Case Aides, OS2s and paralegals. The additional SSS1s will generate additional work as they complete the comprehensive assessments and intentional engagement with families to provide the support needed to strengthen families.

How does this policy package help, or potentially hinder, populations that disproportionately or underserved ? How does this policy package further ODHS ' 3 strategic goals, and both the program and ODHS mission s? A well -staffed and resourced frontline workf orce helps Child Welfare and ODHS to build and leverage culturally and linguistically appropriate community resources and services to support disproportionately impacted families and maintain their children at homes and in their communities of origin whene ver possible . The Vision for Transformation is grounded in equity and anti-racism and all efforts by Child Welfare are planned with a full equity framework at the center. A key component of a full equity framework is a diverse, equipped, and competent wor kforce that has been selected, trained, and supported in equity- building practices and engagement skills related to cultural humility and power sharing. With an intentional focus on the initial contact and approach with families, caseworkers need adequate time and capacity to participate in professional development opportunities to build these skills and the capacity to subsequently meaningfully engage with communities. Increasing the CPS caseworkers and support staff will increase the ability and capacity to center equity- building skills with child welfare workforce and for child welfare to continue intentional engagement with families and most notably with those communities that are most impacted by inequities.

Quantifying results 4. What are the long -term desired outcomes? Child Welfare anticipates that the additional staff will help further reduce the number of children coming into care, increase the number of families receiving in- home services instead of removal, and increase the timeliness of safety assessments. 5. How will ODHS measure the impact on system and access inequities and/or impact disproportionality in accessibility and services in ODHS programs through this policy package? Through increasing the number of CPS caseworkers that are trained in engaging with families and communities Child Welfare will see a continued increase in serving children and families at home and continued reduction in children entering foster care . Throu gh engagement with families and communities in the development of resources, Child Welfare anticipates a reduction of Child Welfare necessary intervention Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 12 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 118 and when intervention is required to ensure safety, more children will remain with their families and in their community. Families will thrive in communities that can best meet their needs and future reports of child abuse and neglect will be reduced. Some of the potential key measurements of impact includes number of kids entering care, number of kids being serviced in- home, diligent efforts throughout the safety assessment and timeliness to completion of safety assessments. How achieved 6. What actions have occurred to resolve the issue prior to requesting a policy package? ODHS Child Welfare is continuously evaluating the CPS process and tools available to staff. A variety of management strategies have been imp lemented, such as dashboards have been developed to allow supervisors to monitor caseloads, reprioritizing resources to areas with high assignments, analyzing the assessment format to develop assessment reports that are concise and clear. As Child Welfare moves toward a person -centered (family -centered) approach, the time necessary to effectively engage with families is critical. Lack of engagement may create barriers to building rapport, engaging positively with parents, and working collaboratively to support parents in determining what their needs are to ensure safety and well-being for the child in their own care. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 13 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 118 7. What alternatives were considered and what were the reasons for rejecting them? The Legislature gives position authority to State agencies. Unless agencies use temporary or non- budgeted positions, t here were no other mechanisms for Child Welfare to acquire the additional workforce positions needed to align with the Oregon Caseload Ratio Standards and to hire more staff to engage with families in order to assess immediate and impending safety risks. 8. What other agencies, programs , community partners or stakeholders are collaborating on this policy package? Child Welfare is working collaboratively with SSP to connect families with communities, resources, and services. Having these resources and services available through SSP and working jointly with SSP when Child Welfare does encounter families will ensure the families have all the support necessary to be successful in having children remain at home safely and the family's well- being preserved. SSP has had a collaborative relationship with Child Welfare and continues to nurture that collaboration as Child Welfare continues to build out a child safety infrastructure focused on intentional engagement and support with families. This project will ensure that families can access the services that they need without Child Welfare being involved in their lives. The ability to develop service s within communities that do not require agency involvement as well as enhancing the services that SSP is able to access will support families in a person- centered approach rather than in a siloed approach. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 14 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 118 Additionally, the Safety Program is partnering a cross training and workforce development teams to ensure that staff are onboarded and developed with the tools necessary to enhance the assessment and engagement skills, ensure that a diverse and qualified workforce is retained and recruited, and that workforce have the on-going professional development needed to increasingly serve families in- home. Increasing CPS caseworkers will ensure that CPS workers will have the time to engage with communities and the resources and services available in those communities. They will engage with families and provide the support needed to seek out resources and services in their communities. Helping communities identify the resources and services their families need where families are defining their own plan, then identifying sustainable funding will ensure that communities are empowered to strengthen and support their families safely while promoting the well-being of individual families and the community. 9. Does this policy package require any changes to existing statute(s) or require a new statute? If yes, identify the statute and the legislative concept. N/A 10. What other state, tribal, and/or local government agencies would be affected by this policy package ? How would they be affected? Child Welfare has intentiona lly spent time with the Oregon Tribes and with the underserved communities to listen and hear their concerns regarding Child Welfare's interventions into their families, tribes, communities, and cultures. Child Welfare is often intrusive into families lives as we may not fully understand the family's culture, community, or inequities they are facing. With the implementation of Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 15 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 118 Family First, Family Preservation Child Welfare has continued to hold community and tribal listening meetings as well as meeting with other states and professionals to hear how they have successfully addressed implemented preventive and restorative programs and services within communities. Child Welfare is shifting their approach and engagement with families away from a system -cente red approach to a person - centered approach in order to better serve families and communities. Child Welfare will continue to hold meetings with tribes and communities to continue to learn and shape the approach, develop community- based resources and serv ices. 11. Is this policy package being requested because of an Oregon Secretary of State or internal audit? If so, provide further information. This request for Child Protective Services (CPS) caseworkers and related positions is, in part, connected to the Oregon Secretary of State's 2018 audit finding that Child Welfare was understaffed for field staff caseworker positions. The Secretary of State's 2019 follow -up report similarly concluded that Child Welfare needed additional caseworkers t o meet it staffing needs.

This core belief is supported by the Vision's for Transformation's three Guiding Principles: 1) Support families and promote prevention, 2) Enhance the staff and infrastructure, and 3) Enhance the structure to utilize data to inform decisions. These principles are intertwined in the daily work and build upon each other with each principle necessary for a successful transformation. A supported, skilled, respected, and engaged workforce that reflects and embraces the communities we serve will ensure we have a network of services promoting prevention and well-being for Oregon's children and families. The framework in this document will support the Child We lfare Division workforce transformation that in turn will support the spectrum of care and services for the children and families in Oregon. With the continued focus to increase prevention efforts and serve children and families safely at home, there is a need to increase internal capacity to maximize staff across all areas of casework - from child protection and family preservation to foster care, permanency, and support of older youth and young adult transitions. Family preservation is a newly developing service that will require staffing, services, and supports that have not traditionally been included in Child Welfare. This area of practice will continue to expand with the implementation of the Vision for Transformation and the implementation of federally approved Family First Prevention Services. Ultimately, an exceptional workforce that is developed and supported at all levels will result in a decrease in vacancies, an increase in retention rates, an increase in longer tenures, increased promotion, mana geable caseloads, Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 22 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 118 and higher workforce morale. The amount of time a caseworker spends engaging with a family correlate directly to improved child and family outcomes. Considerations Caseload models along with workload modeling play an important role in the legislative process and are used to inform legislatively granted position authority and budget. They also are important in establishing how the agency allocates positions to carry out the work of the Child Welfare Division. \"Workload models\" are based on time study surveys where workers are surveyed to determine the amount of time different activities related to caseload require. \"Best -practice models\" factor in standards in child welfare from national organizations such as the Child Welfare League of A merican (CWLA) Standards of Excellence. These best- practice models sometimes include positions not typically included in the case -carrying workload models, such as case aids and paralegals, and result in a recommendation for a larger staff to handle a predicted caseload than what would be recommended by the workload models. Over the years there have been different approaches to analyzing and reporting caseload and workload models. The Oregon Legislature has typically relied on workload models to inform the appropriate position authority and budget for the Child Welfare Division. The Legislative Approved Budget has not authorized the same number of staff as the best- practice model. In implementing the Vision for Transformation, the Division has established a best practice model for Oregon that incorporates the CWLA Standards of Excellence, timing studies done in Oregon in 2008 and 2017, and literature and research reviews. These standards will be the lodestar as Child Welfare moves forward. Oregon Caseload Ratio Standards CWLA recommends, \"agencies should set their own caseload and workload standards\". For ODHS Child Welfare, the compilation of research, data capture (i.e., timing studies), and literature reviews are incorporated into caseload standards and r ecognize that staff are tasked with complex and difficult work each day as they seek to ensure child Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 23 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 118 and family safety and well- being. ODHS Child Welfare will be moving forward with these standards for determining average monthly caseload for the specific caseworker roles outlined below. There are circumstances under which caseloads may vary from these standards. For example, as we have learned in dealing with the impact of the pandemic on staffing, caseloads may be higher when factors arise such as staff vacancies due to staff departures from the agency, promotion or leave such as Family Medical Leave, COVID- 19-related leave, vacation, etc., as any type of leave impacts staff to work at full capacity. Caseload = Workers/Cases: The number of children or fa milies assigned to an individual caseworker. Application of Caseload Ratio Standard Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 24 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 118 The Child Welfare Division has developed an internal Caseload Dashboard for Child Welfare Executive Leadership and program leadership to inform and analyze the current caseload for caseworkers in safety, permanency, and certification. The Caseload Dashboar d provides a statewide snapshot of currently assigned cases. The dashboard is organized by categories, including caseworker type, district, and county level, and can be filtered by supervisor and worker level to provide data on assigned cases. The dashboar d is live caseload data (actuals) out of the ODHS Child Welfare's database, OR -Kids. The data is updated in real-time and subject to change as the quality of information about staff assignments is dependent on information being entered timely and accurately within OR -Kids. Additionally, the dashboard includes the use of human resources data including current staffing, vacancies, rotations, and other hire statuses. This is an internal management tool to assist in assignments and work management. Child Welfar e leadership will use an internal monthly and quarterly average to inform allocations, needs, and trends. Almost half of the caseworkers have been with the program for three years or less. Using that information and the Caseload Dashboard, Child Welfare le adership can better determine the number and type of assignments dispersed between less experienced and more experienced caseworkers. Caseworkers who are new to ODHS Child Welfare generally take more time to complete each task and require additional guidance from supervisors than their more experienced co -workers. Child welfare work is difficult and complex, and it takes a significant amount of time for workers to gain the experience and knowledge necessary to function effectively with a full caseload of fa milies and children. Until a caseworker has established significant experience in the field their work will likely take them longer to complete when compared to more experienced staff. From the internal dashboard and the internal monthly caseload report, C hild Welfare leadership and the staffing allocation committee will monitor the monthly and quarterly average caseloads for Districts and branch offices. This, as well as the tenure information, will help inform the allocation decisions for position assignm ent. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 25 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 118 Conclusion ODHS Child Welfare recognizes the importance of giving caseworkers manageable caseloads as it improves worker morale and retains qualified staff, in addition to the critical goal of improving outcomes for Oregon's children and families. As such, ODHS has taken steps to better understand the current state of worker caseloads and define what caseloads should mean under the Child Welfare Vision for Transformation. This ODHS Child Welfare Oregon Caseload Ratio Standard is a concrete step toward fulfilling all three guiding principles of the ODHS Child Welfare Vision for Transformation by specifically enhancing the staff and infrastructure to support families and promote prevention all while utilizing data to inform the current state and advise Child Welfare's decisions. This will continue to be the framework for future caseload ratio standard considerations. References Collins -Camargo, C., Collins, J., and Wilfong, J. (2018).

However, substance use disorder (SUD) among parents is one of the greatest challenges to keeping children safe and healthy at home. This POP aligns with recommendations from the Oregon Alcohol and Drug Policy Commission t hat aim to reduce Oregon's substance use disorder rate and increase Oregon's recovery rate. It builds capacity for the agency to better respond to the growing complexity of substance use disorder ( SUD ) among child welfare parents and creates capacity for building more consistent and efficient relationships with community partners and SUD treatment providers. When parents in the ODHS child welfare system can access treatment quicker, be supported in achieving recovery, and be assisted in sustaining their recovery from addiction , there will be fewer foster placements and improved child safety and family stability.

ODHS will also increase the internal expertis e to respond to a variety of issues that combine with parental and adolescent SUD, including various mental health challenges and the need for clean and sober housing. This proposal will also grow expertise on drug testing, engaging parents, and partners, and sustaining community treatment relationships that work with parents and adolescents. These positions will also provide ODHS with needed consultation regarding resource family applicants who may have SUD histories or current use concerns. Estimated need: reclass 25 SSS -1s to SSS-2s and add 8 new positions. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 3 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 119 Parental Substance Use Disorders (SUD) continue to be the greatest challenge to child safety. The U. S. death toll from overdose in the country has risen to an all- time high of well over 100,0 00 people in a recent 12- month period, and Oregon has seen an increase in this tragedy as well. The Oregon Child Welfare Critical Incident Review Team has reviewed nine teen fentanyl overdose tragedies in a period of less than 24 months. The Child Fatality Prevention and Review Program ( CFPRP ) has identified Addiction Recovery Teams as a critical support in the prevention of child abuse and child fatalities based on 2019 and 2020 Critical Incident Review Team (CIRT ) fatality data. Approximately 70 percent of reviewed cases included parental history of substance abuse while nearly 50 percent identified substance use as a factor in the child's death. Parental substance abuse went unaddressed in more than 30 percent of cases. CIRT recommendations for caseworkers includes training and support to better understand the complexities of substance use and subsequent impacts to child safety. Circumstances surrounding child fat alities provides a picture into children who are most vulnerable due to parental substance use in Oregon as well as teenagers who are dying by fentanyl overdose . https://app.powerbigov.us/view?r=eyJrIjoiOWY5M2E5MzgtMDU0NC00MjI4LWI5MzctMDQ1MjQ1NWIwMGIzIiwidCI6Ij Y1OGU2M2U4LThkMzktNDk5Yy04ZjQ4LTEzYWRjOTQ1MmY0YyJ9 In the spring of 2021, the CFPR P, in partnership with the Child Safety Program, facilitated the first safe systems mapping session for Oregon Child Welfare. This process was facilitated with the support of Dr. Tiffany Lindsey from the University of Kentucky Center for Innovation in Popu lation Health. In this inaugural round of safe systems mapping, the team explored improvement opportunities in cases involving Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 4 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 119 parental substance use disorder (SUD). These improvement opportunities were representative themes across nine cases reviewed thro ugh the CIRT and Safe Systems Analysis processes between August 2019 and March 2021. Following the mapping process, eight recommendations were shared with Child Welfare Executive Leadership Team that could reduce or prevent child maltreatment in Oregon. Please see Appendix A: \"2021 Oregon Safe Systems Mapping Overview and Recommendations\" for more detail that are directly correlated with this POP. 2. What would this policy package buy and how and when would it be implemented? Three additional Social Service Specialists 2 (SSS -2's) position to serve the families in all branches equitably Two Operations & Policy Analysts 3 (OPA- 3's) designated as experts in Behavioral Health (substance use disorder and mental health) One Administrative Specialist 2 (AS -2) to provide overall program support Two Child Welfare Manager 1 (PEM -Ds) positions to oversee this group of workers The POP would provide position authority and funding for eight new staff for ODHS child welfare, as well as the funding for the reclassification of 25 existing SSS -1's to a more accurate classification to SSS -2. The additional staffing requests include two PEM -D level managers, to manage the Recovery Services Unit, two OPA -3's, and a support staff for the Recovery Services Unit related to these 30 positions and the related contractors. These positions will be used in child welfare to manage delivery supports, collaborate with Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 5 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 119 community partners, and respond to contracted service providers in a joint effort to counter substance use disorder and its negative impact on child safety, child health and parental health. Additional service dollars are not requested in this POP. Contracted services are existing or will exist in all counties. The funding is needed for ODHS Child Welfare e xpertise at the caseworker level. ODHS Addiction Recovery Team specialists will provide training, parental engagement, caseworker support and consultation, service monitoring, and community liaison services to local treatment providers including family treatment courts. 3. How does this policy package help, or potentially hinder, populations that disproportionately or underserved ? How does this policy package further ODHS 's 3 strategic goals, and both the program and ODHS mission s.? Addiction treatment servic es, like many others, have an overrepresentation of people of color, with a less than adequate service response. This POP can increase the engagement of currently underserved communities through focused client engagement goals and service provider relation ships for those families interacting with child welfare. The POP increases capacity, service efficiency to parents within their own communities, and the ability to respond to families across Oregon more equitably. Addiction exists in all cultures and levels of income, but like many other health issues it hits hardest in communities of color and low- income families. Therefore, a focused service, grounded in a knowledge base of the complexities of substance use disord ers and free of the bias that exists toward people with addictions, must be a foundational piece of ODHS services. This POP empowers child welfare parents to achieve recovery, regain their dignity and move toward independence from the illness of addiction. These services move ODHS toward that ideal of citizens achieving wellbeing. Specifically, the POP can provide families Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 6 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 119 the amount and type of supports they need to raise their children at home, or when necessary, in another family home within their community. This POP will increase advocacy for both treatment and peer support services that better serve communities currently most impacted by the inequities of recovery focused services. This is done by using the POP created positions to have specific resp onsibilities for community partner liaison work to available resources and maintaining the relationships to the advantage of parents in the ODHS child welfare system . Quantifying results 4. What are the long -term desired outcomes? This POP aligns with the Oregon Alcohol & Drug Policy Commission plan to develop a comprehensive addiction recovery strategic plan, which ODHS has a role in responding to. The Commission describes two primary objectives \u2014 reducing Oregon's substance use disorder rate and increasin g Oregon's recovery rate \u2014 and provides recommended outcomes in 4 categories: prevention, intervention/engagement, treatment, and recovery supports. All of these are addressed in some fashion through the services supplied which this POP increases and enhan ces within the child welfare population. This POP will increase the existing advocacy for both treatment and peer support services that better serve communities currently most impacted by the inequities of recovery focused services. The created positions will have specific responsibilities for community partner liaison work to available resources and maintaining the relationships to the advantage of parents in the ODHS child welfare system. Statistically, the chronic illness of addiction dominates the cha llenges of people using child welfare, self -sufficiency, employment training and other community services. The child welfare services that intervene on addiction by providing Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 7 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 119 engagement, referral to treatment, support, and training on the intricacies of ad diction and recovery is a standard for all helping services. 5. How will ODHS measure the impact on system and access inequities and/or impact disproportionality in accessibility and services in ODHS programs through this policy package? Oregon child fatality data is extremely clear and demonstrates an ongoing concern for child safety surrounding a lack of resources to assist caseworkers in understanding the often-detrimental impacts of parental substance use on chil dren. This POP is a critical piece in the prevention of maltreatment and fatalities. Parents in the ODHS child welfare system will access treatment quicker, be supported in achieving recovery, and be assisted in sustaining their recovery from addiction. R ecovery decreases foster placements and increases child safety and family stability. This funding would achieve three primary goals of parent engagement, rapid access to SUD treatment and sustaining recovery. How achieved This POP will demonstrate the achievement of recommendations Number 5 and 6 in the Oregon Safe Systems Mapping Overview and Recommendations (see Appendix A: \"2021 Oregon Safe Systems Mapping Overview and Recommendations\"). Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023- 25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 8 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 119 6. What actions have occurred to resolve the issue prior to requesting a policy package? Oregon was once a national leader in responding to this issue. Oregon's actions to address parental addiction began 30 years ago, and the service and staff package to address it has not been increased or adjusted since. In 1991 Oregon child welfare obtained a federal grant to place alcohol and drug support services directly into 8 child welfare branches to assist parents with SUD. These services led to rapid access of parents into treatment which was more important than ever as the federal Adoption and Safe Families Act created shorter timel ines for parents to achieve recovery from their addiction. In 2003 the name was changed to ART ( Addiction Recovery Teams). Current services have been stretched far beyond their capacity, and the need for additional and better managed services is clear. Child welfare has made various efforts to respond to a growing need with an expired service level. In addition, as addiction increases, and becomes more complex through the rise of opiates like fentanyl and the addition of COVID -19. Child welfare parents have struggled to achieve treatment entry, and the isolation of the pandemic has proved deadly. These child welfare services break down that isolation and fill the gap during treatment wait times for parents. 7. What alternatives were consid ered and what were the reasons for rejecting them? Alternatives to meeting child welfare needs in this area do not exist, and in fact, Oregon's creation of services for this challenge had been a national model for many years after their inception in 1991. Key to our local treatment resources and our contracted services being utilized, effectively integrated into case practice, and monitored for effectiveness and contract compliance are the ODHS positions that were authorized by the Legislature in 1991. Thirty years later , the need for these services is still a prime focus of Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 9 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 119 the current Child Welfare Division Vision for Transformation. Behavioral health treatment, specifically substance use disorder treatment, are cited as key components of a statewide safe ty net for families, but the positions authorized 30 years ago are insufficient for the current demand and placed in an administrative structure that decrease their ability to effectively assist parents and caseworkers respond to SUD. 8. What other agencies, programs , community partners or stakeholders are collaborating on this policy package? While no other state agencies are involved directly in the POP itself, many benefit from the work they do including ODHS programs that regularly attend training offered regarding substance use disorder. In addition, local treatment providers benefit from treatment referrals and support to their clinical services since over 75% of children in foster care have at least one parent identified as having an issue with substance abuse. While ODHS is well-integrated with local treatment partners in many sites, they count on us for referrals information, client support, client motivation, outcome collaboration and the creation of relapse prevention and creating ongoing lif e support networks for the clients we share. In that sense the silos of ODHS/OHA, treatment/child safety, and community supports/child welfare are all made less restrictive and more collaborative as the positions in this POP will continue the collaborative work and expand it. This POP is an adjustment to current services that are already highly collaborative with local treatment agencies, family treatment courts, alcohol and drug free housing and various peer support programs. As it is focused on parents an d families struggling with substance use disorder, we already share power, and in most cases defer to the clinical expertise of our partners. The positions in the POP are those who refer to these programs and lay out a set of services that support he continued use of the services in ways a treatment provider cannot. These services also serve as a liaison between treatment and child welfare caseworkers so that plans made on both sides remained fully informed of the work of partners, sharing not only power, b ut Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 10 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 119 treatment goals, safety goals and client challenges that allow our parents and families to work with an informed system that is integrated rather than fragmented. 9. Does this policy package require any changes to existing statute(s) or require a new statute? If yes, identify the statute and the legislative concept. No statutory changes required No. 10. What other state, tribal, and/or local government agencies would be affected by this policy package ? How would they be affected? While no other state age ncies are involved in the POP itself, many benefit from the work they do including ODHS agencies which regularly attend training offered regarding substance use disorder. In addition, local treatment providers benefit from treatment referrals and support to their clinical services. 11. Is this policy package being requested because of an Oregon Secretary of State or internal audit? If so, provide further information.

But children with complex needs are more likely to be placed outside their communities in order to receive specialized services. This proposal seeks to strengthen the well-being of Oregon families through intensive community-based support services f or children with complex needs, allowing them to remain in their own communities in a resource home, relative care, or parent's home . These services will provide coaching, training and support to caregivers and individualized services specific to the child's needs to help keep the child in stable, community -based, and f amilial placements as well as reduc e the risk of placement disruption, Temporary Lodging, and the use of higher levels of care, including residential treatment. This proposal, if approved, will allow for services to be developed throughout the state, incl uding in rural communities. In the long term, these services will prevent unnecessary foster care placements, support families, improve the retention of resource parents, and ultimately save the state money through effective early intervention and partner ships with other systems. The services included in this proposal are Child Specific Caregiver Services (CSCS) and Response and Support Networks (RSN ). This proposal requests funding and resources necessary to implement these Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page| 2 Oregon Department of Human Servic es POP 122 Policy package pricing: $ 7,292,700 $ - $ - $ 7,292,700 0 0.00 Purpose 1. Why does ODHS propose this policy package and what problem is ODHS trying to fix or solve? This proposal seeks to better support Oregon children and families by providing intensive individualized services to prevent the need for out of home placement, higher levels of care and placement instability, allowing children with complex needs to access necessary services while remaining within th eir own communities . To that end, the proposal seeks to address four critical challenges: Critical Challenge #1: Placement stability As of April 20, 2022, a ccording to the Oregon Child Welfare Federal Performance Dashboard, children, and young adults in care experience 5.00 moves per 1 ,000 days, which is higher than the Federal Standard of 4.12. Children with intensive needs often experience many more moves than the average and are much more likely to experience stays in Temporary Lodging. Children who qualify for Behavioral Rehabilitative Services (BRS), mental health and Intellectual/Developmental Disability (I/DD) supports account for the majority of chil dren in Temp orary lodging, reaching 87 percent in 2021. However, due to provider capacity, accessibility, the workforce crisis and a number of other issues, these services are not always available to those eligible to receive . services. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page| 3 Oregon Department of Human Servic es POP 122 Previously, ODHS Child Welfare utilized Out -of-State Residential Treatment facilities to serve some children with complex, multisystemic needs. From 2016 to 2020, Oregon placed 176 children in Out- of-State Residential Treatment Facilities across the country, primarily as the only way to access eligible services. ODHS made the decision to return and serve these children in Oregon in 2020. Since June 2020, no children served by ODHS Child Welfare have been placed in Out -of-State Residential Treatment. While we celebrate that children have returned from these facilities, access to eligible services remains challenging . The FOCUS program serves some of the most complex and vulnerable children in care, as reflected in the QRTP scores visual below: 303378 34 10 0 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022Oregon Out of State Residential PlacementsOregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page| 4 Oregon Department of Human Servic es POP 122 Critical Challenge #2: E quitable access to supportive services The FOCUS Program has been successful in providing community- based Youth Mentoring, Sex Abuse Specific Treatment, Skills Training and Respite services to many children who were previously pla ced out of state, helping them move toward independence or permanency. Sending children hundreds of miles away to access higher level placements does not allow caregivers' direct involvement in the process nor does it support empowerment to incorporate new skills to work with them. Supporting caregivers with the child's very specific needs and providing hands- on coaching may have not only supported the children upon their return but might have prevented the need placement disruption in the first place. Se rvice accessibility continues to be a critical need within Oregon. Many current services are only available within Metro areas and along the Willamette Valley. Between March 2020 and March 2022, 5 percent of children placed in BRS placements with cases coming out of Eastern and Central Oregon A QRTP not indicatedB Youth may benefit from QRTP/ BRS and/ or supportive servicesC Youth will benefit from elevated mental health servicesD Youth not appropriate due to active symptoms in the categories of suicide, psychosis or substance abuse16.02% 7.20% 3.93%2.08%9.52% 1.65%1.03% 0.46%QRTP Scores* Children in FOCUS Services All children in care * Does not include the percentages of children without current QRTP Scores.

In order to build intensive services thoughtfully a nd successfully in these communities, it is necessary to get to know the strengths and needs of each community, assess service array, and determine the best ways to serve the area, while considering the characteristics that make that community unique. Serv ices or providers that are effective in Lane County may not be in Malheur County, for example. Treatment Services and the FOCUS Program have been collaborating with local Child Welfare offices, community partners and service providers for years in collective efforts toward expansion of services into more districts. This proposal will allow us to expand the work. The following map shows the current availability of in- person services for FOCUS Preventative Services. Within the last two years, a small virtua l service array has also been initiated. For example, parents and caregivers of children with sexualized behaviors can access virtual supports through a contract that assists them in understanding the child's needs, setting up structure in the home and mai ntaining healthy boundaries, among other things. Providing this service virtually allows children from across the state to remain in their home and the families to feel safe and supported. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page| 7 Oregon Department of Human Servic es POP 122 Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page| 8 Oregon Department of Human Servic es POP 122 Critical Challenge #3: Removal from home and extended stays in substitute care in order to access supports related to a child's specialized intensive needs Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page| 9 Oregon Department of Human Servic es POP 122 Children are sometimes placed in substitute care, including higher levels of care, because parents are unable to manage their behaviors, mental health symptoms or developmental needs. Traditional Child Welfare systems were built in a way that the child would need to be removed from the home to access necessary services. As Oregon continues to move toward a system that pri oritizes safety and equity through family preservation and prevention, it is crucial that we build a robust service array that can help parents, families, and communities support children with complex needs. These children deserve the services and supports necessary to remain with family in their own communities, but still receive services in the least restrictive way possible. As a system, it is our responsibility to ensure that this is available in the most trauma -informed and culturally appropriate ways whenever possible and regardless of the family's location, financial situation, ability to advocate, access to health insurance, cultural identity, etc. All the services within this POP are community- based and support children at the least restrictive level of care possible. Most are able to provide intensive in- home services in an effort to prevent entry into substitute care and ultimately preserve families. With the Response and Support Network (RSN) and Child Specific Caregiver Supports (CSCS) projects, as well as other FOCUS Preventative Services, future phases are expected to include structure for serving families without current Child Welfare cases, as true prevention or post-Child Welfare intervention or adoption. One of the current Preventative Serv ice Providers has already begun moving this direction independently, having received a grant from the Spirit Mountain Community Fund to support their Next Level Program, which continues to fund services for youth who are no longer in the care of ODHS but w ould benefit from continued mentoring, independent living, and educational supports. This program has been highly successful for the youth involved. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page| 10 Oregon Department of Human Servic es POP 122 This critical issue specifically speaks to Guiding Principle s 2 and 3 within the Oregon Child Welfare Vision for Transformation.

Investing in a program with a proven record of success, with clear dat a and auditing processes in place to oversee not only compliance with requirements, but quality of service , can provide the agency with opportunities to champion the use of quantitative and qualitative data, as well as opportunities to drive forward our agency's mission . We have been able to do this with limited staffing. This proposal seeks to strengthen the well- being of Oregon families by providing intensive community- based support services to children with complex behavioral, mental health and developmental needs who historically have been supported in residential syste ms administered by the Office of Developmental Disabilities Services (ODDS), Oregon Health Authority (OHA), or Child Welfare. Uniquely, this new intensive community -based service array will support caregivers for these children in an effort to reduce or el iminate the cycle of placement disruptions, Temporary Lodging, and unnecessarily long stays in higher levels of care, as well as increase resource parent retention and support reunification efforts. Utilizing a phased approach, these services are also inte nded to support family preservation and reduce the need for children to enter foster care. 2. What would this policy package buy and how and when would it be implemented? We are proposing the funding to create and stage statewide implementation of the follow ing new services for children who are at risk of placement instability, removal from home or extended stay in higher levels of care: A. Child Specific Caregiver Supports - Coaching, Training, Resource Navigation and on -call support services for Resource Pare nts, Relative Caregivers and Parents specifically focused on meeting the individual special needs of the identified child. This non -clinical support service is focused supporting the child's parent or resource parent meet the child's daily behavioral needs. Its goal is to not only stabilize the child's placement but also to support the caregiver, improving resource home retention and maintaining children in their homes. Pilots are being initiated May 2022 in Mult nomah, Clackamas, Washington, Lane, Marion, Polk, and Yamhill Counties. During the 2023 - 2025 Biennium, with the funding needed, we anticipate full procurements for those counties as well as of other Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page| 12 Oregon Department of Human Servic es POP 122 identified districts. Eight districts will have these services in 21 -23. Final expansion to the additional eight districts is projected in 2025-2027.

Response and Support Network (RSN) Rollout - RSN is a short- term (60 -90 days) intens ive urgent response and support for Resource Parents with non-clinical providers, as part of a collaboration with CareOregon to offer immediate cross -system response and referrals. RSN further offers a unique support when OHA's Mobile Response Support Serv ice (MRSS) and 988 (Suicide Prevention line) roll out; the key to MRSS and 988 response is the immediacy of the 24/7 crisis response and connection to ongoing services like RSN. RSN offers a seamless connection to services that are tailored to a priority p opulation and can categorically leverage success of MRSS. Services that are tailored to priority populations have shown to be more effective than service availability for the general population. When MRSS launches, RSN will modify its services offering to next business day response modeling opposed to 24/7 INITIAL response (this will be a cost reduction). Once the service is opened, 24/7 response will be available through RSN for the cohort. When and if BRS in-home services are offered , RSN looks to convert its service offering to bill Medicaid for eligible BRS clients whenever possible. MRSS and new In-home BRS services success and infrastructure leverage will be propelled by RSN's existence. Resource Families and Child Welfare clients will continue to bene fit from the core highly tailored trauma specific supports offered in RSN and the partnerships it represents with CCOs. RSN is currently being piloted in District 2 and District 16, and then will expand to District 10. The goal in the 2023 -2025 biennium would be to partner with FOCUS CSCS to assess community need and readiness in order to determine the best course for expansion as we fully roll out the program , understanding that RSN requires: i. CCO participation ii. Child Welfare Staff Resources (position and funds allocated in this POP) iii. RSN for Adoptive and Guardian Families requires that the general RSN service also be established in the area. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page| 13 Oregon Department of Human Servic es POP 122 If the above requirements are met, Child Welfare looks to initiate RSN in Districts 3, 8, 15, 6, 9 during the 1st phase of expansion efforts. This also includes continuation cost of RSN in District 16, 2, and 10.

How does this policy package help, or potentially hinder, populations that disproportionately or underserved ? How does this policy package further ODHS 's 3 strategic goals, and both the program and ODHS mission s.? In all procurement processes, the FOCUS Program prioritizes contractors who are able to not only describe their ability to meet the needs of underserved or disproportionately represented populations, but also those contractors who demonstrate that serving these populations is a part of their agency's values and mission. The current FOCUS Preventative Service Array includes several programs that specifically serv e populations that are traditionally underserved or dis proportionately represented in Child Welfare. This includes culturally specific youth mentoring for African American teen boys, youth mentoring for teen girls who have been victims of CSEC, skills training & youth mentoring and equine assisted mentoring within rural communities with few other services, youth mentoring, group and leadership activities for youth identifying as LGB TQIA2S + and tutoring for students who have fallen through educational gaps due to multiple stays in residential care, as well as others. In addition, we seek out providers who prioritize a culturally and gender diverse staff , as well as staff with lived experience who can relate to the children and families being served. All services withi n the Preventative Service Array, which would include the services developed through this proposal, are required to be highly individualized and focused on the specific strengths, needs and goals of the child and family being served. The child and family/ caregiver are required to be involved in setting the goals, as well as creating the service plan. All of these services align very closely with the ODHS Child Welfare Vision for Transformation, especially Guiding Principle number 1, Supporting Families and Promoting Prevention. As such, these services are all built around the fundamental goals that FOCUS aims for with all services in the Preventative Service Array: 1. Maintaining Children within their communities; Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page| 15 Oregon Department of Human Servic es POP 122 2. Stabilizing Children at risk of placement disruption; 3. Reducing barriers to necessary services; 4. Being trauma informed and strength- based; 5. Supporting equity and being culturally responsive; and 6. Preventing the need for higher levels of care. This policy package furthers the ODHS strategic goals of Strengthening Foundations and Creating the Future of Human Services. The current two FTE in this program have proven that the FOCUS Program is able to build equitable and strength -based service delivery in highly effective, efficient and successful ways . Investing in additional specific positions and programs within FOCUS will allow the agency to build upon this success to expand both service delivery and the ability to oversee these additional programs through effective contract administration and thorough program auditing and support . This policy package also furthers the goal of Creating the future of human services in Oregon . As the FOCUS program builds services, a level of infrastructure for communities to utilize is also being strengthened. Many of the programs we work with community partners to develop later use that same infrastructure to create additional supportive services within their communities that are not funded by ODHS. The FOCUS team works with contractors to support them in diversifying and building a community network that can be partially self-sustaining and can support the local community. For example, one Youth Mentoring c ontractor has been able to build a large local network of volunteers and donors to provide additional supports to the children and families in their services. In addition, they have been able to access grants that allow them to serve youth who are no longer in the care of ODHS so that they can continue to provide services despite cases closing when needed. As the FOCUS program develops additional services in communities across Oregon, we work with local community partners to assess the current services available in that community and determine what gaps exist. We then work with service providers to procure services to meet the community's identified needs. We prioritize contractors who are based within the local community to be served or who have experience serving that community. While we are Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page| 16 Oregon Department of Human Servic es POP 122 developing services that will be rolled out statewide, specific contracts are negotiated individually based on the needs of the communities being served and local partners are involved in those procurement processes. As we look at the ODHS Mission Statement \"To help Oregonians in their own communities achieve wellbeing and independence through opportunities that protect, empower, respect choice and preserve dignity\", it is easy to see how this proposal moves us toward that goal. This proposal seeks to provide intensive supports to children and young adults, as well as their caregivers and families, who have complex unmet needs that often cause them to fall through the cracks of other systems. The goals of these services are to prevent the need for substitute care, shorten lengths of stay in high levels of care and prevent placement disruptions and utilization of Temporary Lodging. This Policy Package also furthers the mission of the FOCUS Program, \" Empowering youth with specialized needs to find healing, quality of life and permanency by providing the right supports at the right time \" by focusing on providing services to children and families before a crisis situa tion occurs. Preventing substitute care and higher levels of care benefits children, families, communities , taxpayers, the agency, and the State of Oregon . It helps meet each goal and mission set by the agency. 4. What are the long- term desired outcomes? The following outcomes are expected: Decreased number of placement changes Reduce d length of stay in and reliance on higher levels of care such as residential treatment Expanded access to services within rural regions and for population -specific services Reduction in Temporary Lodging Increased Resource Care retention within the populations served by these contracts Measurable improvement within service quality and quantity Shortened timelines for reunification Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page| 17 Oregon Department of Human Servic es POP 122 Reduction of children coming into care due to the parent being unable to meet the child's behavioral or other needs Reduction in Adverse Childhood Events Reduced cost per case. In the long run, t hese outcomes will strengthen the shift away from a focus on crisis and reacti on to growth as an agency with a foundation of wellbeing that is strength based and community driven, while focused on the principles of prevention, equity, and empowerment. 5. How will ODHS measure the impact on system and access inequities and/or impact disproportionality in accessibility and services in ODHS programs through this policy package? All services provided, children served, districts served, service types, service closure reasons, child demographic information, race and ethnicity and length of time in the service will be tracked within the ODHS FOCUS Dashboard currently available in SharePoint . Referrals and the number of caregivers served will be tracked by providers and FOCUS Program staff. Provider s are also required to utilize specific methods to measure outcome and provide outcome data. Comprehensive Program Review audits and interviews of children and families served will also be conducted for quality assurance. We will also be cross checking this with data related to Temporary Lodging. RSN has initiated its final dashboarding process after rendering results for the first Pilot year. The RSN dashboard is combined data reported by our contractors and automated pulls from ORKIDS. Qualitative data is further collected to assure clients satisfaction. The dashboard relies on the BRS, District, and State cohort to compare and contrast. 6. What actions have occurred to resolve the issue prior to requesting a policy package? Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page| 18 Oregon Department of Human Servic es POP 122 Over the last 5+ years, the Treatment Services Program has worked to build a Preventative Services Array for children who would have historically been served in residential treatment facilities due to their mental health, behavioral and developmental needs but are now placed in community settings. This has been done with a small number of staff through thoughtful utilization of the FOCUS and Treatment Services budgets. In this time, more than a dozen successful programs have been built that provide Youth Mentoring, Skills Training, Eq uine Mentoring, Sex Abuse Specific Treatment and Overnight Respite for children and young adults at risk of placement instability or removal from home. In addition, Treatment Services has created p ilot projects to study the effectiveness of several new ser vices included in this proposal, each with the intention to provide earlier, less intrusive support in the community. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page| 19 Oregon Department of Human Servic es POP 122 Using LEAN practices, some of our systems and processes have been reviewed to reduce or eliminate unnecessary inefficiencies and allow fo r the more effective utilization of staff and funding. FOCUS and Out- of-State Procedure has been amended Service Authorization processes restructured Weekly team meetings were initiated to re -prioritize work and manage projects Through existing partn ership with OC&P, approval was gained for Template Statements of Work for service types most frequently used Engagement with the Policy Unit and DAS was initiated to reduce insurance barriers for non-commercial independent contractors to support equitable and diverse supports are accessible Several Pilot Projects were facilitated to study the most efficient way to provide comprehensive services prior to rolling out services on a larger basis. In addition, close collaborations with system partners continue to ensure services align but do not overlap with others in the continuum. For example, FOCUS holds a contract with Jasper Mountain for PRTS due to CCOs authorization delays or denials for children medically eligible and in need of the service. Through this contract and in partnering with OHA, education and technical training for both the Contractor and CCOs has taken place and progress is being made. At first, this contract was utilized to access PRTS for children denied the service by their CCO while ODHS and the clinical provider filed appeals of the denials. Over the last couple of years, we have used this contract to work with CCOs and OHA regarding how processes can be expedited. While we still make some referrals utilizing this process, for the most part, the PRTS stays that result are nearly always funded Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page| 20 Oregon Department of Human Servic es POP 122 by the CCO , either for the entire stay or after a short assessment period funded by FOCUS. While this contract is underutilized, we still consider it a success in that it has helped us access this level of care for children in nee d, often paid through systems previously denying the authorizations. RSN used LEAN mapping during the planning phase to successfully build these Lean processes that establish zero case worker time to initiate and one phone call to start all the automated authorization processes: RSN is authorized with one phone call, funds are authorized between Child Welfare and the CCO upon the initiation of the response through an automated notification through the call center. Services are made available thr ough fixed cost contracting and cost reimbursable contracting that were projected through a thorough placement disruption calculation. All collaborators and their supervisors are made aware of the need to respond and the situation through a coordination e mail. Each collaborator then takes initiative in coordination of services led through Maple Star's (our no clinical 24/7 responder) established protocol. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page| 21 Oregon Department of Human Servic es POP 122 RSN has the capability of full-service emersion within 1 -3 business days after initial after -hours response to include authorization from the CCO for Behavioral Health services and all can be initiated with a resource parents request. Through a quasi -Lean process and project management planning process; authorization, referral, and criteria for respons e obstacles have been eliminated to achieve service enrollment without the difficulties typically associated with accessing behavioral health supports through other systems, causing less work for caseworkers and central office staff and making the process much easier for families in need. FOCUS has identified further processes for its other offerings that could assist us in streamlining services and procedure if additional staff were available to facilitate these, such as increasing provider access to ORKIDS, electronic and standardized provider record keeping, standardizing provider access to required trainings, creating more efficient systems for Comprehensive Program Reviews, and systematizing reported concerns similar to how CCA reports are processed. 7. What alternatives were considered and what were the reasons for rejecting them? An alternative to this request is c ontinued service delivery, without additional collaboration betwee n state systems including partnership in reaching underserved regions and populations . While services are delivered through ODHS and OHA children's systems, its current structure is reliant upon families to navigate the system to identify services by funding stream and appropriate agency of administration. This puts the onus on families to understand state agency administrative roles, qualifying factors for various services as well as an understanding of how to access needed services . Additionally, t imelines to access services currently average 60 days or longer Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page| 22 Oregon Department of Human Servic es POP 122 which is not tenable for children and families requiring immediate supports. In fact, this is a driving factor behind this proposal as the service expansion is designed distinctly to sup port families while long er-term and sustainable supports can be leveraged . 8. What other agencies, programs , community partners or stakeholders are collaborating on this policy package? Close partnerships include: OHA, CareOregon, Pacific Source, Local SOC groups, the Foster Care Team, ODDS, county I/DD agencies, ILP, provider agencies, Resource Parents, local offices, and community partners, many of whom have lived experience, on various aspects of this proposal. Additional community partners and CCOs in the different communities will be involved as projects progress. In addition, the FOCUS Program administers a Comprehensive Review process with all large providers. A large part of this includes conversations with the youth currently receiving services, as well as program staf f, caseworkers, Resource Parents, and other involved people regarding their current services. The process allows learning about what is working well, what could be improved and what our team could do to make these services even better. During these conversations, recipients share what other services would be helpful and what else they need from the agency to be successful. These conversations will continue to ensure that services are effective and meeting the needs of the children, families and caregivers b eing served. Having direct input from youth with lived experience has been critical in our planning for this POP and the direction of these services. RSN is a first of its kind project in the state that is 50/50 funded (braided funding) by Child Welfare and a CCO for mutual benefit. Other CCO's have taken notice of its success , reached out to understand more and request partnership. In addition to RSN 's demonstration of effective ness in its first year, it's possibly the first meaningful Child Welfare and CC O partnership since the inception of CCO's. This partnership includes county, and community SOC groups who also have requested more information. RSN not only is known within the state, but information has been requested by Washington and Colorado State. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page| 23 Oregon Department of Human Servic es POP 122 9. Does this policy package require any changes to existing statute(s) or require a new statute? If yes, identify the statute and the legislative concept. No statute changes are required. 10. What other state, tribal, and/or local government agencies would be affected by this policy package ? How would they be affected? Other state and county service agencies, such as the Oregon Health Authority, Office of Developmental Disability Services, Oregon Youth Authority, County juvenile justice agencies, county mental health and developmental disability agencies, Coordinated Care Organizations, etc. will benefit from this policy package by being able to partner with the subsequent contractors to walk al ongside their own service contractors to provide a comprehensive package of community based services to meet the child and family' s complex multidisciplinary needs. This, in turn, makes their own service provision more effective and reduces silos . Services created by this package will be available to designated children and families involved in tribal services without Child Welfare involvement , as are all FOCUS funded services. The other benefit to agencies is that, as FOCUS works to develop program s, an infrastructure is created that can be utilized by other agencies to create additional services within their own service array. FOCUS partners with other agencies to provide advice and technical assistance related to program development and compliance oversight in an effort to build out a robust cross- system service array. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page| 24 Oregon Department of Human Servic es POP 122 11. Is this policy package being requested because of an Oregon Secretary of State or internal audit? If so, provide further information. No, however under the current Temporary Lodging Settlement Agreement (3:15 -cv-01895 -YY), the agency is required to ensure that services and supports have been offered and explored before Temporary Lodging is authorized. The services outlined i n this request are intended to expand and enhance the children's service array to support children in familial settings and prevent them from disruption. Staffing and fiscal impact Implementation date(s): 10/1/2023 End date (if applicable): N/A 12. What assumptions affect the pricing of this policy package ? RSN relies on Coordinator Care Organizations (CCO) participation and financial contribution for behavioral health supports. Without CCO participation, RSN will not be available in the area ; nor wi ll RSN for Adoptive and Guardian families as it relies on the infrastructure with the RSN vehicle . With that said, the cost of RSN may be significantly less if a CCO declines participation. The assumption made in this pricing is that ALL CCO will participa te in the program. Further assumptions are made that staff allocation are made to support the rollout of such a large network across Oregon, the current staffing model of FOCUS does not and cannot support such an extensive rollout. Last assumption, the pri cing model utilized for braided funding within Multnomah County translates across the districts and their unique layout and needs. Multnomah County was the most expensive Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page| 25 Oregon Department of Human Servic es POP 122 county, prices were reduced through lean process in phase 2 of the Pilot rollout; whi le eastern counties have less youth in care and custody, their network adequacy and geographic spread add some unknowns to pricing but also require more investment to assure response. This Policy Option Package pricing assumes a start date of 10/1/2023 for the Child Specific Caregiver Supports to identified districts, with the Response & Support Networks to be phased in and in place by July 2024, with allows for time to develop contracts in new areas in the state. 13. Will there be new responsibilities for another agency (OHA etc.) and/ or ODHS/OHA Shared Services ? Specify which programs and describe their new responsibilities. No, Child Welfare's Treatment Services FOCUS Program will take on the responsibilities of developing procuremen ts for the additional services and building the necessary structure to implement this expansion. As always, services and supports will be developed in transparent communication and partnership with OHA Children's Behavioral Health 14. Will there be changes to client caseloads Cost per Case or services provided to population groups? Specify how many in each relevant program. This proposal will not increase, decrease, or move caseloads . It will instead assist Child Caseworkers by offering increased assistance in accessing necessary services. However, increased assistance to families prior to a foster care placement may ultimately prove to decrease the number of children in foster care. There may be some effect on the Cost per Ca se for the FOCUS man dated caseload will increase by the cost of this POP. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page| 26 Oregon Department of Human Servic es POP 122 RSN will likely have a positive effect on District s overtime . Caseworkers will no longer need to respond while on-call in many circumstances as situations of requested response will be more adequately supported through RSN after business hours. 15. Describe the staff and positions needed to implement this policy package, including whether existing positions would be modified and /or new staff would be needed. This request does not include request for staffing. 16. What are the start -up and one -time costs ? The costs are all ongoing. 23-25 biennial costs are less than the ongoing costs due to the program expanding starting October 2023 and the phase -in of districts over time for the child specific caregiver supports (CSCS) . 17. What are the ongoing costs? The 23 -25 biennial cost for 1 2 months of RSN and 21 months of CSCS is $7,292,700 General Fund. The future 24-month biennial costs of these services are $ 14,908,000 General Fund. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page| 27 Oregon Department of Human Servic es POP 122 The expectation is that this funding would be built into the FOCUS service budget allotment after the initial investment. Within the first phase of this proposal, infrastructure building for RSN adoptive and guardian families would be require an allocation of General Funds to be spent on families outside of Child Welfare to support placement stability. Treatment Services is committed to researching additional funding options and investigating any additional federal matching for these expenses as this progra m matures . 18. What are the sources of funding and the funding split for each one? 100 percent General Fund for services . 19. What are the potential savings? Service Biennial Cost Monthly Cost Months Cost Response & Support Network (RSN) $ 8,028,000 $ 334,500 12 3,852,700.00 RSN Adoptive and Guardianship $ 2,880,000 $ 120,000 12 Specific *23-25 is to get a total of 8 districts with these services. Phase in for 25-27 would add in the final 8 districts. Avg. cost per district is $250,000 per biennium.Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023- 25 Ways and Means Page| 28 Oregon Department of Human Servic es POP 122 With the expansion of FOCUS services there may be longer term costs that are affected, as children are better served in community settings.

If a child is not able to remain in their own home, we need resource families who are diverse and affirming and can provide the support a child needs within their communities . Resource families receive a monthly payment, but the r ates for Foster Care have not been adjusted since 2018. In 2018, the rates were based on 56.5% of the cost of raising a child at the USDA rate. Cost of living and inflation rates have continued to climb. The rate is intended to cover cos ts of food, shelter, clothing, school supplies, extracurricular activities, etc. for children in ODHS foster care. Resource Families have voiced to ODHS that the current rate does not cover the actual cost of caring for a child. The policy option package would bring the basic family foster care rate up to 64 % of the cost of care to raise a child. The rate would change at each biennium to include regular inflation and additionally, medical, and professional inflation. This would allow for increases every bie nnium. Increasing the rates could help attract and retain more resource families and help current resource families cover the cost of care.

Rates for Foster Care have not been adjusted since 2018. In 2018 the rates were based on 56.5 percent of the cost of raising a child at the USDA rate. Cost of living and inflation rates have continued to climb. The reimbursement rate is intended to cover costs of food, shelter, clothing, school supplies, extracurricular activities, etc. Resources Families have voiced to ODHS that the current rate does not cover the cost of caring for a child. We continue to have families request additional support for food, clot hing, and shelter. The monthly base rate for caring for a child is currently $ 693 for ages 0 -5, $733 for ages 6 -12 and $ 795 for ages 13 - 20. This rate creates challenges in ODHS' efforts to recruit new prospective resource families and retain current resource families . Bordering states, Washington, and California, have higher reimbursement rate s. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 3 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 1 23 Washington recently increased their rates.

What would this policy package buy and how and when would it be implemented? The policy option package would bring the basic family foster care rate to 64 percent of the cost of care to raise a child. The rate would change at each biennium Current Service Level using the Resource Parent Rate Model, using updated USDA costs or, alternatively, using regular and medical/professional inflation rates as provided by DAS to update the model . This would allow for increases every biennium. The tabl e below displays the total 18 -month cost for an increase to 64 percent cost reimbursement. ODHS Child Welfare is requesting approval to phase in costs in the 25- 27 biennium to reach the updated 100 percent cost reimbursement rate level. 3.

Increased support can provide further opportunity for targeted recruitment of resource families to maintain children with family, kin, or homes with expertise either lived or learned that can meet the well- being support of children with complex needs because more resource families will be able to afford to care for a child. The ODHS Vision for Transformation Guiding Principle 1: Supporting Families and Promoting Prevention means that our Child Welfare t ransformation is built on trauma -informed, family and community -centered and culturally responsive programs and services focused on engagement, equity, safety, well -being, and prevention. Keeping children connected to their community, family and identity is paramount to decreased experiences of trauma . Quantifying results 4. What are the long -term desired outcomes? One desired outcome is to c ontinue support ing our goal of keeping children with their families and within their communities. If a child is not able to remain at home , Child Welfare wants to have resource families that are diverse, affirming and located in or near the community a child comes from to support maintaining connections. Other desired outcomes are to increase community awareness about becoming a resource parent, to increase relative placements, and to support specific homes to meet individual needs of child or sibling group. 5. How will ODHS measure the impact on system and access inequities and/or impact disproportionality in accessibility and services in ODHS programs through this policy package? Families, relatives, kith/kin will have support in caring for a child in foster care and able to m eet their needs without extraordinary out- of-pocket costs associated with raising a child.

Payments directly to a certified resource family have not changed since the last policy option package rate increase in 2018. OAR 413-090-0051 requires review of rate every two years and was listed in recommendation s of both the SOS 2018 audit report and the 2019 follow up report. A POP is required to increase the rate . Additional supports are provided to families with childcare at a very low reimbursement rate of $375 per month per c hild. Respite services are offered to provide breaks in care and are reimbursable at a current rate of $ 85 per day. With funding from last session , ODHS CW is constructing types of respite available and looking to expand this support to resource parents. Increased Respite availability is expected to support retention of certified resource homes.

What alternatives were considered and what were the reasons for rejecting them? Payments directly to a certified resource family have not changed since the last rate increase in 2018. Additional supports are provided to families with childcare at a low reimbursement rate of $375 per month per child. Respite services are offered to provide breaks in care . 8. What other agencies, programs , community partners or stakeholders are collaborating on this policy package? Oregon Resource Family Alliance was made aware of the POP and is in support , Oregon Tribes, Resource Parents , Youth, or those with lived experience in the foster care system. No direct con nection currently with listed partners. 9. Does this policy package require any changes to existing statute(s) or require a new statute? If yes, identify the statute and the legislative concept. N/A 10. What other state, tribal, and/or local government agencies would be affected by this policy package ? How would they be affected? Oregon Resource Family Alliance, Oregon Tribes, Resource Parents, Youth, or those with lived experience in the foster care system. Increase in rate would allow for Oregon Resource Family Alliance to continue their support in recruitment of certified homes. The rate increase would help retain certified foster homes, boost recruitment efforts, and minimize out- of-pocket expense for all certified ODHS homes . Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 12 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 1 23 11. Is this policy package being requested because of an Oregon Secretary of State or internal audit? If so, provide further information. OAR 413-090 -0051 requires review of rate every two years.

What assumptions affect the pricing of this policy package ? Rate increases will need to be kept competitive using update data and/or current inflation rates. If rates are not adequate recruitment and retention of resource homes will be challenging. 13. Will there be new responsibilities for another agency (OHA etc.) an d/or ODHS/OHA Shared Services ? Specify which programs and describe their new responsibilities. No 14. Will there be changes to client caseloads Cost per Case or services provided to population groups? Specify how many in each relevant program. Cost per case will be impacted in the Regular Foster Care, Shelter Care, Adoption Assistance, and Guardianship Assistance budgets. The change in cost per case is funded by this Policy Option Package.

No positions are needed to implement this policy package. 16. What are the start -up and one -time costs ? N/A 17. What are the ongoing costs? This policy option package, funded for 18 months in the 23- 25 biennium , will cost $ 27,882,335 total fund for the 64% cost reimbursement level of investment. IV -E federal funding is available for IV- E eligible children, with federal funding making up 37.5% of the total fund expenditures. In addition, for future biennia, we are proposing to update the Resource Parent Reimbursement Rate Model each biennium. If the underlying data from the USDA report \"Cost of Raising a Child *\" is updated, this data would be used to update the model. In lieu of that report being updated, we are proposing to update the model cost categories by the regular and additional inflation amounts, as provided in the budget instructions by DAS. Other data sources would be updated as well. These changes, calculated as part of Current Service Level budget , will keep Resource Parent reimbursement rates in line with the costs of care. *Source:Lino, M., Kuczynski, K., Rodriguez, N., and Schap, T.

Potential savings are difficult to determine at onset. Likely stabilization of certified homes and increase in tenure of resource parents. Families will be able to support a child in their home in ways that support belonging and natural and prudent parenting practices that allow children in foster care to participate in activities that children not in foster care get to naturally participate in on a more consistent basis. Resource families may be less likely to request the child move and close their home due to financial hardship. Total for this policy package General Fund Other Funds Federal Funds Total Funds Pos.

FTE Policy package pricing: $1,424,399 $0 $1,424,399 $2,848,798 Oregon Department of Human Services (ODHS) Program: Office of Developmental Disabilities Services (ODDS) Policy package title: Model Employer Policy package number: POP 126 Related legislation: LC - Employment First / Model Employer (based on HB 2151 2020) Summary statement: All people deserve equal access to employment opportunities that allow them to thrive as valued members of their communities. The state of Oregon is committed to fair employment practices and no n-discrimination . Less than 1% of the state's workforce is comprised of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD), because this population faces common, disability- based barriers when trying to access state employment. The Model Employer program is designed to hire people with I/DD into state service. This policy o ption package (POP) requests dedicated full -time equiv alent ( FTE) for positions for the Model Employer program . Providing this opportunity for people with I /DD to have access to state employment by removing common barriers faced by people with I/DD in the state hiring process and incentivizing hiring managers to utilize this process will increase access to state employment for people with I /DD. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 2 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 1 26 Purpose 1. Why does ODHS propose this policy package and what problem is ODHS trying to fix or solve? Less than 1% of the state's workforce is comprised of people with I /DD. However, people with I /DD contribute significantly to the workforce as demonstrated by several employer testimonials. Not including people with I /DD in the workforce undermines all state level service equity initiatives, contributes to workforce shortages, and disadvantages the state as an em ployer. Given that the Oregon Department of Human Services (ODHS) is responsible for serving people with I /DD, not employing people with I /DD also means that the system is not represented in the same way. 2. What would this policy package buy and how and whe n would it be implemented? This POP would dedicate a pool for 20 positions to ODHS, specific for hiring people with I/DD. Specifically: Five administrative specialists (AS1s) Five office specialist 2s (OS2s) Five human services assistant 2s (HSA2s) Two student human services workers Three program analyst 1s (PA1s) Additionally, a pool of eight part-time human services worker positions are requested to provide paid internship opportunities for the state's current Project Search program. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 3 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 1 26 Finally, one operations and policy analyst 3 (OPA3) is requested to administer the program. This includes data tracking, working with hiring m anagers to understand the program, etc. 3. How does this policy package help, or potentially hinder, populations that are disproportionately underserved? How does this policy package further ODHS's 3 strategic goals, and both the program and ODHS missions? People with I /DD have historically faced significant inequities. From being segregated into institutions as their living environments to being paid subminimum wage in segregated work environments. Although Oregon has been a leader in closing institutions for people with I /DD, and in September 2020 ended funding for the last sheltered workshop in Oregon, people with I /DD continue to face barriers to employment, as is evident by the current employment rate of people with I /DD in state government. Providing this opportunity for people with I/DD to have access to state employment by removing common barriers faced by people with I /DD in the state hiring process through the direct appointment process (allowing for informal or working interviews, a streamlined application process, etc.) and incentivizing hiring managers to utilize this process, will increase access to state employment for people with I /DD. Additionally, ODHS is responsible for creating, overseeing and implementing policy and funding for people with I /DD to live and work in their communities. For that reason alone, it is critical that people with I /DD are an integral part of the ODHS workforce so they can be part of how these programs are designed and developed. Further, it is often not un til people have an opportunity to participate in a diverse work environment that they understand the full benefits of what someone with I /DD brings to the workforce. This opportunity will positively impact not only people with I /DD but ODHS as a whole by m aking it a more inclusive organization. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 4 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 1 26 Quantifying results 4. What are the long -term desired outcomes? This POP is only the beginning of a success model employer program. The intent is that, over time, people with I /DD who are hired into these positions will move into other programs, promotional opportunities, etc. When any of these positions are vacated, the posit ion would remain for a person with I /DD, so another person with I /DD will have the same opportunity. Additionally, as hiring managers come to understand the value of working with people with disabilities and the substantial contributions people with I /DD bring to the workforce, it is likely that hiring managers will hire people with I /DD even without specific position authority. This has been the case with hiring managers who have previously hire d people with I /DD. As more people with I/DD enter the state workforce, this will contribute significantly to the work ODHS does. Specifically, people with I /DD utilize all ODHS programs. Having people with I /DD as part of the ODHS workforce will not only better workplace culture, it will better the outcomes for people with I /DD in the state of Oregon. 5. How will ODHS measure the impact on system and access inequities and/or impact disproportionality in accessibility and services in ODHS programs through this policy package? The desired result of this solution is that people with I /DD are integrated into the state workforce. If this POP is approved, once position authority is granted, ODDS with its ODHS partners will track those positions to ensure that they are filled. This would mean that at least 20 people with I/ DD had entered the state workforce. Additionally, as people with I /DD vacate positions, it will be monitored to ensure there are promotional opportunities and the position remains for people with I /DD. Finally, if a program or position is not able to be utilized, or people are not retained, ODDS and ODHS partners will be able to assist to address any concerns to support hiring managers with this work. Overall metrics will focus on: Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 5 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 1 26 1.

What actions have occurred to resolve the issue prior to requesting a policy package? The Office of Developmental Disabilities Services (ODDS) , in collaboration with Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) has been working on a Model Employer program since 2017. This program includes allowing hiring managers to direct ap point people with I /DD into positions within state government. ODDS also ran a legislative concept and proposed a house bill (HB 2151) to codify this policy and program. Unfortunately, this did not pass. After reviewing other programs, it is clear that the re are a few additional resources needed to incentivize hiring managers to ensure the state employs people with I/DD . Specifically, these types of programs have proven to be effective in other states, such as Illinois, and cities, such as Seattle. Those states implemented associated FTE for model employer positions in various ways, which Oregon has not yet been able to do. This proposal works to change that by creating FTE dedicated to the Model Employer program. 7. What alternatives were considered and what were the reasons for rejecting them? See above. Alternatives have been in place, including operating a Model Employer program without dedicated FTE. ODDS will continue this work, but the addition of dedicated positions has the potential to infinitely incre ase the number of people with I /DD in state service. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 6 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 1 26 8. What other agencies, programs, community partners or stakeholders are collaborating on this policy package? The Model Employer p rogram was developed based on other state and county government programs. Once the initial process was outlined, I /DD stakeholders, as well as ODDS partners, such as VR , were engaged to ensure it will meet the needs of Oregon. Further, when HB2151 was proposed there was an opportunity for formal public comment and a hearing. Many people, including the Oregon Council on Developmental Disabilities (OCDD) and self-advocates testified in favor of the bill. Further, VR is a primary partner in this work and already actively engaged in the Model Employer initiative. ODDS has c onsulted with Child Welfare and the Self Sufficiency Program to discuss potential position needs. Additionally, ODDS has worked with Aging and People with Disabilities in recent efforts to hire someone with I/DD as well as regular engagement with Human Resources regarding this program. As these positions would be available to all ODHS hiring managers, the intent of this project would be to benefit all of ODHS. 9. Does this policy package require any changes to existing statute(s) or require a new statute? If yes, identify the statute and the legislative concept. This POP does not require changes, but an associated l egislative concept (LC) has been submitted in alignment with the previous House Bill 2151. LC is titled: Employment First - Supporting people with intellectual and developmental disabilities to get and keep jobs in the community. This LC would impact ORS 427.007(1)(b) . Proposed language would be based on HB 2125 presented in the 2020 session. 10. What other state, tribal, and/or local government agencies would be affected by this policy package ? How would they be affected? See question 8. ODHS would be primarily impacted. However, our Project Search program takes place with Imaging and Record Management Services, so they would also be positively impacted. The intention of this Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 7 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 1 26 LC and POP is not only to provide dedicated position authority but also to emphasize the need and desire to employ people with I /DD at all levels of state and local government. 11. Is this policy package being requested because of an Oregon Secretary of State or internal audit? If so, provide further information. No. Staffing and fiscal impact Implementation date(s): 7/1/2023 End date (if applicable): NA 12. What assumptions affect the pricing of this policy package ? The pricing is based on position authority and funding for: Five administrative specialists (AS1s) Five office specialist 2 s (OS2s) Five human services assistant 2s (HSA2s) Two student human services workers Three program analyst 1s (PA1s) Additionally, a pool of eight part-time human services worker positions are requested to provide paid internship opportunities for the state 's current Project Search program. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 8 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 1 26 Finally, one operations and policy analyst 3 (OPA3) is requested to administer the program. This includes data tracking, working with hiring managers to understand the program, etc. 13. Will there be new responsibilities for another agency (OHA etc.) and/ or ODHS/OHA Shared Services ? Specify which programs and describe their new responsibilities. ODDS has worked historically with Human Resources (HR) , the Office of Equity and Multicultural Services (OEMS ) and VR on the Model Employer Program. ODDS would continue to coordinate this work. It would be important to have HR, in particular recruiters, be aware of this program and how to utilize it to share with programs. For ODHS programs who wou ld hire someone with I /DD, training would be available for units and hiring managers. This would not be a significant workload change for other programs. 14. Will there be changes to client caseloads Cost per Case or services provided to population groups? Specify how many in each relevant program. No. 15. Describe the staff and positions needed to implement this policy package, including whether existing positions would be modified and /or new staff would be needed. This Policy Option Package (POP) would dedicate a pool for 20 positions to ODHS, specific for hiring people with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD). Specifically: Five administrative specialists (AS1s) Five office specialist 2 s (OS2s) Five human services assistant 2 s (HSA2s) Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 9 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 1 26 Two student human services workers Three program analyst 1s (PA1s) Additionally, a pool of eight part-time human services worker positions are requested to provide paid internship opportunities for the state 's current Project Search program. Finally, one operations and p olicy analyst 3 (OPA3) is requested to administer the program. This includes data tracking, working with hiring managers to understand the program, etc. 16. What are the start -up and one -time costs ? There are no start up or one -time costs for this program. ODDS has already developed the program, and with this dedicated position, can manage this program long term. 17. What are the ongoing costs? The ongoing cost would be the positions requested . 18. What are the sources of funding and the funding split for each one? The funding is 50/50 General and Medicaid Match Federal Funds. 19. What are the potential savings? Though it is hard to anticipate a fiscal on the savings, ODHS currently suffers from a significant workforce shortage and turnover. This has a cost to programs in terms of not getting work done, delays in work and an overall negative impact to the people ODHS serves. Further, with turnover comes enhanced training costs and poor morale amongst employees. This program would help with all of these concerns.

Parents with intellectual and developme ntal disabilities (I/DD) have long faced overwhelming challenges and have endured discrimination, while being failed by various systems that are intended to support them to have full lives with their children and families in their communities. ODDS propose s a new set of innovative services intended to support parents with I/DD more effectively and keep families together. These new services, \"supported parenting\" would provide person-centered support for parents with I /DD to raise their children independentl y in their communities. ODDS request s to maintain permanent 2.0 FTEs that are currently temporary American Rescue Plan Act-funded positions for cross- systems coordination with Child Welfare (CW) and other systems to ensure optimal services to parents with I/DD and children involved in the CW system.

FTE Policy package pricing: $387,997 $0 $564,445 $952,442 2 1.50 Purpose 1. Why does ODHS propose this policy package and what problem is ODHS trying to fix or solve? This proposal includes multiple elements that address unique problems. 1. Parents with an intellectual and developmental disability (I/DD) continue to face challenges in caring for their children. There is not currently a resource or funding stream that meets the unique needs of Oregonians with I /DD who wish to build upon their parenting skills. Often community parenting classes and home visiting services are not able to accommodate the variety of learning styles and needs of people with I /DD and therefore do not adequately meet their individualized goals. This proposed supported parenting service will be person centered and individualized to meet the person's needs and goals in a way that is relevant and empowering to them. There is evidence that with appropriate support, parents can increase their skills in caring for their children and equip them for long-term success. ODDS proposes to add a supported parent ing service to the children and adults' home and community -based services ( HCBS) waivers so that Oregonians with I /DD can build healthy and independent parenting skills to take care of their children in their homes and communities. Twenty-six ODDS -contract ed case management entities (CMEs) provided the following data: There are at least 352 parents with I/DD receiving ODDS services, and of that number, 231 (65.5%) would be interested in utilizing a specialized service to develop their parenting skills. CME survey participants were also asked to provide any further feedback they may have about this concept. The overwhelming response from Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 3 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 1 28 CMEs was that this could be an invaluable service to individuals who need support to build their parenting skills and raise their children as independently as possible in their own or family homes. 2. Children with I/DD in the custody of Child Welfare (CW), along with parents with I/DD receiving services from Child Welfare, face unique barriers to service access at the inter section of two distinct, complex ODHS programs. In response, ODDS has utilized American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds to fill two limited duration (LD) positions, one to support co- case management technical assistance across Oregon and another focused- on po licy barriers between these systems. These two positions are key to reducing t emporary lodging for children with I/DD, supporting parents and ensuring timely service access for some of Oregon's most vulnerable children and youth. These positions need perma nent funding to continue this work. Examples of projects staffed by these roles include: Temporary lodging prevention joint policy guidance Statewide temporary lodging staffing Co-case management guidance for both programs Dedicated legislative analysis for CW -related bills that may impact children with I/DD in community and/or CW-certified settings Development of legislative concepts and rules in collaboration with CW to remove barriers and enhance service access ODDS representation in CW comm ittees and workgroups Development of new service models to enhance statewide children's services capacity Training development for entry -level staff on each system Dedicated support and technical assistance for local relationship building through establishment of best practices and small pilot projects Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 4 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 1 28 2. What would this policy package buy and how and when would it be implemented? 1. A new, specialized service called \"supported parenting\" that would provide person -centered and individualized support for parents who experience I /DD to raise their children independently. This service would be based on the person's assessed need and chosen goals. This service could include 1:1 skill building, training and home visiting curricula adapted for paren ts with I /DD, and in -person modifications for community resources provided by personal support workers (PSW) s and direct support professional (DSP s) at home and in the community. 2. Resource allocation for ODDS to maintain permanent positions at 2.0 FTE for cross -systems case management technical assistance and operations/policy analysis January 1, 2024 would be the implementation date for both supported parenting services to begin. The two positions for cross -systems case management technical assistance and operations/policy analysis were initially filled in 2022 with ARPA funding and would continue as full -time positions if funded. 3. How does this policy package help, or potentially hinder, populations that are disproportionately underserved? How does this policy package further ODHS's 3 strategic goals, and both the program and ODHS missions? Supported parenting as a specialized service will help parents with I /DD raise their children in their homes and communities. Historically this population has faced stigma and many challenges around their ability to successfully parent. This service could help to r educe some of those challenges and stigma. The department will also request support from community partners in developing this service in a way that is relevant and meaningful to parents with I /DD. We anticipate outreach to self -advocates and other groups to develop advisory committees, stakeholder groups and leadership opportunities. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 5 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 1 28 Our outreach strategies include using small, community- based organizations throughout the state to reach underserved and marginalized Oregonians in their own community. Targe ted populations include Tribal communities, rural Oregonians, LGBTQIA2S+ groups, migrant and undocumented families, people who speak languages other than English and families who experience poverty. The two positions will focus on the vulnerable populati on at the intersection of CW and I/DD services and amplify the voices of those with adverse experiences in advisory committees, workgroups and focus groups dedicated to evaluating current barriers, developing new programs and services, and ensuring quality and compliance statewide Quantifying results 4. What are the long -term desired outcomes? Expanded access to needed services among key populations. Estimate from 26 CMEs: 352 parents enrolled in I/DD services with their CME, of that number, 231 would be interested in a supported parenting service (65.5%) . A decrease in I/DD eligible children in Child Welfare custody entering temporary lodging. Increased awareness and collaboration leading to expanded access to placement resources and support services for children and families. 5. How will ODHS measure the impact on system and access inequities and/or impact disproportionality in accessibility and services in ODHS programs through this policy package? Impacts and success would be measured via participation counts, satisfaction surveys and focus groups. These measures would also allow ODHS to make needed adjustments with the input of the targeted population and partners. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 6 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 1 28 How achieved 6. What actions have occurred to resolve the issue prior to requesting a policy package? The Office of Developmental Disabilities Services (ODDS) and Child Welfare (CW) have collaborated to support families who are involved in both systems more efficiently. This cross collaboration includes ODDS hiring CW liaisons with ARPA funds, participating on the CW Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) committee , and has management participation in the i nteragency partnerships committee focused on reducing temporary lodging . ODDS is also currently creating a worker guide to s upport the field on how to use existing services in a way that benefits parents with I /DD to support their children; examples include attendant care may be used to support best practice in parenting. These two strategies have helped to lessen this gap in supportive services for parents and children, but more long-term capacity is needed to sustain this progress. 7. What alternatives were considered and what were the reasons for rejecting them? Attempts have been made to assist parents with parenting skills needs via in- home supports within current attendant care guidelines. However, this is substantially limited and cannot address the direct, hands- on support parents need to help care for their children. While the use of in- home supports is helpful, t his approach does not have the capacity needed to fully address the parenting needs of this population. ODDS and CW recognize the need for collaboration in order to better support families and individuals who access services from both programs. While col laboration and communication has been initiated, there is a strong need for specific technical assistance and operations/policy analysis work to support the implementation of positive, long-term changes that would adequately address these concerns. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 7 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 1 28 8. What other agencies, programs , community partners or stakeholders are collaborating on this policy package? Self-advocates , Children's Services Advisory Council, Vision Advisory Committee, and ad hoc community groups supported the initiation of this policy option package by helping to identify this gap in service s, provide input on the needs of children with disabilities involved with Child Welfare and develop a white paper. Twenty -six ODDS contracted CMEs support this POP by providing the following data through a survey request: There are at least 352 parents with I/DD receiving ODDS services, and of that number, 231 (65.5%) would be interested in utilizing a specialized service to develop their parenting skills. CME survey participant s were also asked to provide any further feedback they may have about this concept. The overwhelming response from CMEs was that this could be an invaluable service to individuals who need support to build their parenting skills and raise their children as independently as possible in their own or family homes. This further showed the need and interest in this becoming a permanent service. Child Welfare (CW) has participated in the planning and implementing of cross service trainings for workers in the CW and I /DD fields. ODDS and CW have collaborated to support families who are involved in both systems more efficiently. This cross collaboration includes ODDS hiring CW liaisons with ARPA funds, ODDS participating on the CW ADA committee , and management participati ng in the i nteragency partnerships committee focused on reducing temporary lodging . 9. Does this policy package require any changes to existing statute(s) or require a new statute? If yes, identify the statute and the legislative concept. Legislative Concept Number 10000 -003. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 8 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 1 28 A. Allow limited flexibility for parents to attend to their children in child foster homes when approved by the department . The d epartment will develop specific criteria in Oregon Administrative Rule s. B. Allow limited flexibility for young adults (age s 22-25) to remain in a child foster home setting while transitioning to independent living and/or perusing higher education or training, with department approval and specific criteria to ensure the health and safety of the young adult as well as any children residing in the home. The department will develop the specific criteria in Administrative Rule. 10. What other state, tribal, and/or local gove rnment agencies would be affected by this policy package ? How would they be affected? CW would be affected by this policy package as there would be cross collaboration between CW and ODDS to help strengthen community relationships and leverages existing re sources by including bridges to what is inaccessible, rather than duplicating efforts. Two FTE CW liaison positions are being requested in this package and would be of no fiscal impact to CW. 11. Is this policy package being requested because of an Oregon Secretary of State or internal audit? If so, provide further information. N/A Staffing and fiscal impact Implementation date(s): January 1, 2024 End date (if applicable): N/A Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 9 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 1 28 12. What assumptions affect the pricing of this policy package ? Currently the two FTE position outlines in this policy package are ARPA funded which is assumed to end June 2023. It is also assumed the CMS approval of the 1115 Waiver will fund most of the new service being requested on an ongoing basis . 13. Will there be new responsibilities for another agency (OHA etc.) and/ or ODHS/OHA Shared Servic es? Specify which programs and describe their new responsibilities. Children with I/DD in the custody of CW, along with parents with I/DD receiving services from CW , face unique barriers to service access at the intersection of two distinct, complex ODHS p rograms. In response, ODDS has utilized ARPA funds to fill two LD positions, one to support co-case management technical assistance across Oregon and another focused -on policy barriers between these systems. These two positions are key to reducing t emporar y lodging for children with I/DD, supporting parents and ensuring timely service access for some of Oregon's most vulnerable children and youth. These positions need permanent funding to continue this work. Examples of projects staffed by these roles: Temporary lodging prevention joint policy guidance Statewide temporary lodging staffing Co-case management guidance for both programs Dedicated legislative analysis for CW -related bills that may impact children with I/DD in community and/or CW-certified se ttings Development of legislative concepts and rules in collaboration with CW, to remove barriers and enhance service access ODDS representation in CW committees and workgroups Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 10 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 1 28 Development of new service models to enhance statewide children's services capa city Training development for entry -level staff on each system Dedicated support and technical assistance for local relationship building through establishment of best practices and small pilot projects 14. Will there be changes to client caseloads Cost per Case or services provided to population groups? Specify how many in each relevant program. There is a potential for parents with I /DD whos e children are involved with CW to want to engage in I/ DD services where they have not in the past. This could case an increase in people enrolled in I/ DD services. 15. Describe the staff and positions needed to implement this policy package, including whether existing positions would be modified and /or new staff would be needed. We request r esource allocation for ODDS to maintain permanent positions at 2.0 FTE for cross- systems case management technical assistance and operations/policy analysis. The two pe rmanent CW liaison positions (2.0 FTE) for case management support and operations/policy analysis will support in developing programs and solutions, developing guidance, and perpetuat ing consistent practices across the state for this service .

FTE Policy package pricing: $711,758 $0 $6,410,420 Disabilities Services Program: ODDS Policy package title: ODDS Systems - Case Management and Provider Systems Policy package number: POP 129 Related legislation: N/A Summary statement: In the 2020s, t he ability to collect quickly, transparently, and effectively , share, analyze and communicate data is an essential component of providing equitable and accessible human services . The Office of Developmental Disabilities Services (ODDS) lacks a centralized data system to manage the case management services and supports it provides to roughly 32,000 people across Oregon . ODDS seeks position authority and funding to secure a case mana gement system , a universal provider portal , and a robust agency provider system to improve provider reporting capabilities and to replace ODDS' antiquated ASPEN system that will be shut down in one year . These system upgrades will improve ODDS' service delivery on many levels, some of which include communications, quality assurance, licensing, data collection and equitable access to case management services and supports . Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 2 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 1 29 Purpose 1. Why does ODHS propose this policy package and what problem is ODHS trying to fix or solve? ODDS seeks position authority and funding to secure a Case Management System, a Universal Provider Portal, and a robust Agency Provider System to replace the antiquated ASPEN system that will be taken offline in one year by CMS . Currently , ODDS is operated with 45 contracted case management entities (CMEs) with no centralized data system. Many CMEs have access data base systems, some have Excel files and very few have sophisticated systems owned by their community mental health program ( CMHP ) partners that require them to limit their data. Currently ODDS is required to send Excel spreadsheets to get client addresses to perform mailings. In these mailings we do not always have the proper guardian information when needed or the proper language for the individu al receiving the correspondence. Our mailings are over 32,000 letters and on average we receive back more than 600 letters for bad addresses. A case management system is needed to centrally house all information, collect demographic information, and provid e information regarding cultural diversity for the more than 32,000 individuals who receive services from ODDS . Today ODDS, APD and OHA have bargained, non -state workers that go into homes to provide care to our population of Medicaid recipients. Our current systems do not allow us to know if a worker is credentialed in one system when applying to another if the worker is under investigation in another program or if the worker is working unauthorized overtime across the systems. We need to know whether the worker has various provider IDs and various payment systems so we can have one system with one login. This makes it very difficult to follow rules, ensure suppor ts are provided as stated, pay the worker timely and accurately, and send consistent messaging for all programs. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 3 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 1 29 The ASPEN tool is a federal system that was built more than 20 years ago and does not allow customization to the needs of the licensing Orego n Administrative Rules ( OARs ) and Oregon Revised Statutes ( ORS ) that we must operate within. This leads to staff separately track ing the need information that is not allowed in the older system. Creating a new provider system will allow new financial scree ns, enrollment screens and the ability to record the actions identified by rule that we must meet . Both provider systems will also incorporate data used to ensure appropriate placements such as the capability to provide the services each individual is as sessed including cultural communication (such as language s other than English), location to families and schools, and age similarities. All systems, provider, and case management will provide real -time data on services based on key elements defined by the program , such as age, gender, ethnicity, race, and sexual orientation. 2. What would this policy package buy and how and when would it be implemented? As all three projects are currently in initial planning and procurement, these are staff costs and contract costs. These staff will form the teams performing planning with stakeholders including design and requirements meetings, implementation, and operations and maintenance for each of the three systems. Upon request for propo sal (RFP) conclusion , system costs will be requested. breakdown estimates: Staff: $ 4,917,666 (TF) procuring the system: $3,000,000 for implementation services of two systems (not an ongoing expense), $3, 000,000 in licensing costs, $3,500,000 for document management, offline data access, a public portal for individuals and providers and hosting. Costs are estimated based on market analysis; no RFP has been Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 4 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 1 29 generated at this point. Based on conversations with other states and vendors, we estimate the RFP to contract to implementation will be two years as this will be performed in iterative stages per the requirement s of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) . ODDS currently has General Fund dollars to use for the system procurement in the amount of $2.3 million. Once matched with the federal funds at 90% , this should cover our costs for both systems from procurement to implementation. Savings will be realized in reduced travel, mailings, pape r, staff time, reduced need for our CMEs to have individual case management systems and staff time to produce solid data as the entire system will be centralized. 3. How does this policy package help, or potentially hinder, populations that are disproportionately underserved? How does this policy package further ODHS's 3 strategic goals, and both the program and ODHS missions? Together, a ll three systems will allow the state to have immediate information for individuals in I /DD services and the providers who are serving them including REAL -d information which will provide valuable equity information from CMEs and providers . All systems will produce reports that summarize this data as defined by ODDS in collaboration with the diversity, equity, and inclusion ( DEI) coordinator. These systems will be built with longevity in mind by avoiding as much customization as possible. These systems will also allow us to communicate quickly with families and providers when necessary . The systems will have an external portal for clients and families to access needed information and the ability to receive messages in their desired language. The value of this urgent communication has been brought to light with the recent wildfires and the pandemic. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 5 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 1 29 Centralized data systems allow for more streamlined and transparent services. This also make the services more predictable for the consumer and will help bridge the trust gap that exists in the Black, Latino, Asian, and Pacific Islander communities. The systems wil l provide the a bility to compare I /DD enrolled individuals with census data and identify areas of needed outreach. ODDS has CMS approval for 90/10 funding for new systems planning , development and implementation. Building a team to procure, build business requirements, test the product, and then train and implement in the field is imperative. Having the ongoing ability to maintain this team for future business needs , changes, technical assistance, and ongoing training is essential. This need has been confirmed with lessons learned from the Centralized Abuse Management ( CAM ) system . We do not want to repeat this mistake. This system will create transparency of services for individuals and families. Currently parents and individuals who receive services cannot see the information we hold for their service plans or accounts. T he last phase of the new development will be to add the individual and f amily portal so individuals and their representatives may view relevant information. Provi ding individuals access to their records will allow for easier transitions between providers, CMEs , case managers within the CMEs and information about what and who is available to work with them. This central information repository will allow ODHS to ha ve real-time data on the makeup of our program population and to inform whether we are meeting their cultural needs. For example, do we have someone who speaks their language to work with them and if not why and how could we resolve that issue ? Our desire is to Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 6 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 1 29 procure a system that allows at least the five main languages used by our population to be incorporated into the system. Providers also have limited viewing abilities in current systems. Increased transparency will allow providers to stay on task for maintaining their credentials. Transparency of providers will also allow individuals seeking their services the opportunity to see the number of complaints filed against them, any substantiated findings, and positive findings . Individuals will also have access to providers' areas of operations, such as whether the home is located near a transit stop or whether the staff are equipped to handle one's individual language, cultural or other needs and criteria . They have never had full access to such informa tion, which will improve their chances of a successful placement. Quantifying results 4. What are the long -term desired outcomes? Our current system is first focused on the CME not on the person. The new system will be first and foremost about the person with the CME indicated as a provider. The individual's person-centered plan will live in this system, and the system will be based on the person-centered plan. Knowledge and transparency of all the individuals in the I /DD program as well as the peop le who provide services to them. Easy to access data for case managers, providers and family members or individuals. Building systems that can be utilized by the enterprise for holistic views of provider s and service recipient s. Data that will allow ODD S to make more informed decisions regarding services, provider quality and quantity, and budget. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 7 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 1 29 The person will have access to their records in real time, which has never been available for ODDS' services. The state will have access to all records of ind ividuals receiving ODDS' services and will be able to respond to complaints in a timely manner with the facts at our fingertips. People's individual service plans will be accessible to them 24/7. They won 't be required to wait on a printed copy. They will have the ability to e -sign documents. 5. How will ODHS measure the impact on system and access inequities and/or impact disproportionality in accessibility and services in ODHS programs through this policy package? ODDS will measure these items using the r eal-time data from the new systems. Some of these data include information about the individuals served such as where they live, information about CMEs' staff and the trainings they have completed, when they make referral s for an individual, the processing time between the referral becoming effective, the individual support plan ( ISP) documents which will show how much an individual participates in their plan and how much is family driven, REAL -d information on the population s we serve, and service equity plans by the CMEs and how well they are being managed. Having new provider systems will allow us to work closely with the Geograph ic Information Systems ( GIS) unit to map provider locations, regions of various services, changes in CMEs, referrals ) and trainings conducted or requested. The new systems will drastically improve the effectiveness of ODDS' communications. We will be able to track individual s' and guardians' preferred communication method s (text, email, mail ), have access to updated addresses and be able to immediately and directly communicate with them rather that depending upon CMEs and providers to share our messaging. This will also reduce mailing costs as we will be able to communicate via the system in the language and the method they prefer. We will have the a bility to communicate new service opportunities to all eligible individuals via the system. With new awareness from this data, ODDS will be able to increase efforts more effectively in to reduce racial disparitie s within identified areas of the program . Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 8 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 1 29 The Quality Assurance (QA) Unit will have the ability to evaluate effectiveness of CMEs from their computer s, by accessing on-site visits' needs at identified sites. This will reduce travel expenses and travel time. QA will use the new system's data to evaluate areas of the state where we need to build the capacity of I/DD services, where we are oversaturated with providers and what actions we need to take to correct these disparities. The el igibility denials data will tell us whether there are any racial disparities occurring and where so the state can investigate. We will be able to better evaluate the timely services of a CME (assessments and ISP ) and whether they are they occurring, why they are not, and whether this is a particular case manager 's issue or an issue at the CME level . How achieved 6. What actions have occurred to resolve the issue prior to requesting a policy package? We attempted to add the case management system into the existing eXPRS system used by ODDS , which is a home -grown system. This went nowhere due to restricted resources and the fact this system was originally built in 2005 and would need a lot of work to be considered an option. This action would not lend itself to the modularity CMS now requir es. 7. What alternatives were considered and what were the reasons for rejecting them? ODDS has 45 contracted CMEs across the state, each has their own method of keeping case management records. No one entity has a system that could be utilized for the la rger need. 8. What other agencies, programs, community partners or stakeholders are collaborating on this policy package? APD and OHA Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 9 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 1 29 9. Does this policy package require any changes to existing statute(s) or require a new statute? If yes, identify the sta tute and the legislative concept. No 10. What other state, tribal, and/or local government agencies would be affected by this policy package ? How would they be affected? None 11. Is this policy package being requested because of an Oregon Secretary of State or internal audit? If so, provide further information. No, however there are certain audit findings that would be resolved in maintaining data centrally. Staffing and fiscal impact Implementation date(s): 7/1/202 2 End date (if applicab le): 12. What assumptions affect the pricing of this policy package ? The c osts of these systems are based on estimates received from market analysis. Staffing will change as certain staff will be contracted instead of brought on as state staff due to many rounds of failed recruitments. The positions that we will contract are not required to be ongoing to so the pricing will decrease upon their Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 10 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 1 29 contract e nd dates. Other assumptions that could affect the pricing are the number of other programs that utilize the system later . This could include licensing costs and any additional enhancements that may be need ed. ODDS is assuming the $2.3 million General Fund identified for system development currently in our budget will cover the costs of all system procurements as they are matched 90% by the federal government. 13. Will there be new responsibilities for another agency (OHA etc.) and/ or ODHS/OHA Shared Services ? Specify which programs and describe their new responsibilities. For the Background Check Unit, we would request an interface to the new provider system to allow background check information to be loaded automatically into the new system to avoid the need for manual entry. This has been a discussion, and we were assured this can be done easily with their new ORCHARDS system. There will be collaboration with the Office of Information Services for analysis of the initial impacts of other systems for interface purposes. For any other agency choosing not to use this system , there will be no impact. 14. Will there be changes to client caseloads Cost per Case or services provided to population groups? Specify how many in each relevant program. No, this system will not affect claiming or billing nor change eligibility. 15. Describe the staff and positions needed to implement this policy package, including whether existing positions would be modified and /or new staff would be needed.

What are the start -up and one -time costs ? New staff and contracted staff are needed for the startup. The contracted staff will be removed at the end of the project. Systems will have initial startup costs of ~ $6.5 million TF Dollars for design, development, and implementation and ~$3 million for initial licenses. 17. What are the ongoing costs? Annual license fees, operations, and maintenance staff 18. What are the sources of funding and the funding split for each one? 90/10 CMS approved advanced planning document. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 12 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 1 29 19. What are the potential savings? Savings of G eneral Fund but denying exceptions to CMS compliances by CME s as we will have full transparency. Savings generated by the QA teams being able to determine quality and quantity of case management work without traveling across the state. Savings of time for individuals and families and case managers as all will be able to see pertinent information in the system on their own.

In Oregon, the ONE eligibility system is key in making this a reality. As of May 2022, 1.5 million Oregonians access critical medical, food, cash, and childcare benefits thr ough the ONE system - representing a historic level of need triggered in large part by the COVID -19 pandemic. We need to make sure that ONE operation has the necessary resources to process applications and administer benefits in a timely manner, because pe ople can't thrive when they are facing interruptions in their ability to see a doctor, choosing between paying bills, or buying food, losing paid work in order to care for a child or are unable to afford necessities for their families. Since its initial la unch in 2020, the Oregon Eligibility Partnership has made significant improvements to business practices and computer systems in order to boost efficiency and maximize existing staff resources. Still, we don't have the staffing levels necessary to make sur e everyone who is eligible gets what they need when they need it. Without these resources, vulnerable Oregonians may experience longer delays in applications processing, delays that can mean the difference between going hungry and having enough food for th eir families.

In this policy option package, Oregon Department of Human Services is requesting position authority and funding for additional eligibility staff who will answer calls, assist people in person who are applying for or receivin g benefits, process applications on a timely basis, and provide support to community partners who assist people in applying for benefits. These resources will help move the ONE system toward its goal of processing applications same day/next day and ensure Oregonians' timely access to benefits. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 3 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 142 Purpose 1. Why does ODHS propose this policy package and what problem is ODHS trying to fix or solve? Oregon is reliant on the new ONE system to help process and provide food, housing, cash, and medical benefits to nearly 1.5 million Oregonians - the largest caseload in Oregon's history. The system processes applications and updates eligibility at a rate of approximately 300,000 per month and sends approximately 450,000 critical correspondences to applicants and clients per month. The ONE system wo rks in tandem with a customer service phone system. Both systems are new to staff and the individuals applying for program benefits. As we continue to mature both systems and implement functionality designed to make the experience better for both the us ers and staff, we are regularly experiencing backlogs of eligibility determination work. Currently, the backlog consists of approximately 2,000 to 3,000 applications that are past federal processing deadlines, which is 30 to 45 days depending on the progra m. We expect that during the unwinding of PHE, we could see these numbers increase by 10 times these figures due to a historic number of cases, the condensed timeline to begin redeterminations, and the increased demand for services and applications receive d. These delays directly affect the timeliness of eligibility decisions and provision of benefits and is suspected to disproportionately affect those in historically underserved communities. Medical redeterminations were modified during the public health emergency, which allowed us to complete eligibility work and maintain a manageable backlog. With the impending implementation of redeterminations Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 4 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 142 for medical and able -bodied adult s without disabilities (ABAWD) program, there is little chance the current workforce can complete existing a nd additional work without creating historic wait times and backlogs. The enormous workload is currently being handled through the heroic efforts of permanent staff (including overtime) and temporary staff , but we anticipate these high- volume numbers to remain high for the foreseeable future - and to outlast the availability of temporary workers. To demonstrate the gap, we have combined monthly volume estimates, current per worker processing average (4 applications or 7 changes per day) and the average days available for processing each month (21.5) which demonstrates the staffing gap shown in the table below. Applications Redeterminations (Medical and other) Changes Other Activities Phones Total Count 70,000 130,000 100,000 70,000 370, 000 Adjusted for automated Processing 45,500 85,000 100,000 70,000 300,500 Average Processing per worker per day 4 4 7 7 Average Days available per month 21.5 21.5 21.5 21.5 Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 5 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 142 Number of Staff needed 529 988 664 465 280 2,927 Current Staff available 1,420 GAP of Staff needed 1507 In addition to eligibility workers, ONE needs lead workers, support staff and managers to accomplish the system's aims. Staff ratios driving these position asks are one lead worker for every 20 new eligibility staff; one support staff position for every 100 new eligibility staff; one manager for every 15 new eligibility support staff and le ad, and training and policy positions ( one of each for every 25 to 50 new eligibility support staff and lead). However, ODHS acknowledges that we are experiencing historic caseloads at a time that there is low unemployment and high levels of competition due to workforce shortages. We have adjusted our ask to focus on clearing positions ODHS has already hired above our Legislative ask, and our expected ongoing hiring levels based on training and current hiring practices. This mix of positions will help us with stabilization around positions brought on and allow us to verify our ability to hire. We will continue to come back and ask for positions until we can reasonably meet the needs of Oregonians. 2. What would this policy package buy and how and when would it be implemented? This investment helps to support ODHS' and OHA's ability to deliver benefits and services timely and accurately. The eligibility workforce gap estimate is based on a current workload modeling of the best Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 6 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 142 assumptions available. Modeling workload and staffing is an effective way of estimating what resources are needed to deliver services. The abil ity to confirm assumptions with current services provided has been possible given the ONE system reporting and dashboarding capabilities. The combination of modeling and utilizing valid estimates and assumptions in those models has proven a reasonable way to estimate and request appropriate resources. Staff earned in the workload model (total 2,157) : 301 HSS1 (APD, SSP) 1,517 HSS3 Position Management However, ODHS is requesting staffing based on the needs of the agency, what we have hired already over our Legislative Authority, and making sure we ask for the positions for what we plan to hire. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 7 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 142 3. How does this policy package h elp, or potentially hinder, populations that disproportionately or underserved ? How does this policy package further ODHS 's 3 strategic goals, and both the program and ODHS mission s.? This solution allows us to right- size staff to ensure our systems can stay in place and support integration of eligibility and accountability for operations to individuals applying. These supports answer the calls and assist community partners engaging wi th communities and assisting individuals in applying for programs. These positions will allow staff to better serve the nearly one in three Oregonians who rely on ONE, providing timely and accurate benefits and determinations. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 8 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 142 Quantifying results 4. What are the long -term desired outcomes? Sustainable , timely and accurate benefit determinations and improved customer service. 5. How will ODHS measure the impact on system and access inequities and/or impact disproportionality in accessibility and services in ODHS programs through this policy package? Access equity is at the heart of the ONE system , which substantially increased peoples' opportunities to apply for benefits and combined multiple programs' benefits into a unified system to make navigation easier for consumers. The more we deliver t imely and accurate access to benefits, the greater our impact on historic access inequities. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 9 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 142 How achieved 6. What actions have occurred to resolve the issue prior to requesting a policy package? ODHS approached the Legislature with a 2021 -23 policy option package (P OP) that requested additional eligibility workers and staff support positions. The POP was not funded but began a conversation on right-sizing eligibility for the new ONE system and led to a decision to ret urn with a right- sizing POP in 2023. During the interim, additional investments and adjustments have been made to the ONE system and its business processes. Further, we are applying LEAN principles and conducting ongoing assessment of efficiency and effec tiveness as we do our work. However, caseload has risen to a high of 880,000 and is expected to remain 25 percent higher than pre-pandemic caseload. 7. What alternatives were considered and what were the reasons for rejecting them? ODHS continues to work on system efficiencies, worker efficiencies, turnover, and absenteeism. These measures, though impactful, will not close the gap. 8. What other agencies, programs , community partners or stakeholders are collaborating on this policy package? The Oregon Eligibility Partnership is a collaboration between ODHS, Oregon Health Authority, and the Early Learning Division/Department of Early Learning and Care.

With ONE we have created an opportunity for Ore gonians to apply online, over the phone, through the mail or in person at any of our offices. Oregon has continued to invest in the ONE system since the initial release. But, like any system, there needs to be continued maintenance and then investment to m eet the ever -changing needs of Oregonians and programs. The ONE system needs to continue to evolve our operating system to support a more integrated effort. ONE is a new system that individuals and community are still learning about. Engagement with community is critical to our success as we move from a siloed to an equality approach and then shift to an equity framework and person -centered, outcome -based system. Dedicated staffing is critical to connect with community and partners. Improved and sustainabl e ONE system operational support helps ensure constituents will see accurate and timely eligibility determinations, which will result in better access to basic food, health, cash, and childcare benefits in some of the most critical individual and family si tuations. Oregon Department of Human Services: 2023 -25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 2 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 143 General Fund Other Funds Federal Funds Total Funds Pos. FTE Policy package pricing: $16,200,175 $840,000 $22,148,479 $39,188,654 34 26.00 This proposal would provide one-time funding for paying off the final deliverables from the contract related to the Integrated Eligibility Project, closing out the largest IT project's obligations from the history of Oregon. Funding would also support ongoing maintenance and operations services, st affing and service dollars for needed system modifications to more quickly meet consumers' n eeds, support training, system changes and building better equitable practices based on feedback we have had from partners across Oregon . This POP also pays for the additional licenses and support for the Centralized Abuse Management system that is supported by O EP. Oregon Department of Human Services: 2023 -25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 3 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 143 Purpose 1. Why does ODHS propose this policy package and what problem is ODHS trying to fix or solve? Oregon is reliant on the new ONE system to help process eligibility applications for food, housing, cash, childcare, and medical benefits for nearly 1.5 million Oregonians, the largest caseload in Oregon's history. The system proce sses applications and updates eligibility at a rate of about 300,000 per month and sends about 450,000 critical correspondences to applicants and clients per month. The ONE system works in tandem with a customer service phone system. Both systems are new t o staff and the individuals applying for program benefits. The ONE system is supported by the Oregon Eligibility Partnership within ODHS. This system currently supports the needs of individuals applying for medical, food, cash, and childcare assistance. It supports individuals being able to apply online, over the phone, through paper and in -person at our offices; as well as supporting the network of community partners who assist individuals with applications. At any one time, the ONE system could have cued up 10 - 12 critical system changes or enhancements in different stages of development and implementation. And we anticipate this trend to continue as better designs are discovered, program requirements change and improvements to base system functionalit y are developed. We are certain a steady stream of system change is in our future, and we need additional staff and other resources to right- size that effort. Oregon implemented the ONE system but needs to continue to evolve our operating system to support a more integrated effort. Before creating the ONE system, people in Oregon had to go to multiple offices, they couldn't Oregon Department of Human Services: 2023 -25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 4 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 143 apply online for all their benefits, they had to tell their story multiple times and provide verifications multiple times to dis parate systems and siloed staff. With ONE we have created an opportunity for Oregonians to apply online, over the phone, through the mail, or in person at any of our offices. However, we need to continue to support this statewide model, training more sta ff, in more programs, providing supports so we can ensure we have individuals with the right knowledge to meet Oregonians in the way they choose to apply. Long call times, staff having to learn new systems for the first time in their career, and support f or community have created a need for additional supports not previously recognized until the system rolled out. Oregon is also going through historic change, the Public Health emergency, and the COVID -19 pandemic, pushed workers home and segregated indivi duals we serve from access to workers. Even as we kept offices open, we have tried to find ways to serve individuals as effectively as possible. As we continue to come back and unwind these efforts, we need to learn and train our staff on ways to serve in dividuals and learn new ways to support a transitioning workforce more equitably. 2. What would this policy package buy and how and when would it be implemented? Increase staffing to improve client services, eligibility activities, and program support to best meet and sustain service level expectation for the ONE system and support services. This would require: Funding and Permanent Position Authority to Establish the Following New Positions OEP/ONE Oregonian Support (AP Tech Team) PSR4 6 OEP/ONE Oregonian Support (AP Tech Team) and Office Simulation Training, Testing & Support, OEP/ONE UAT Test Writers/Testers OPA1 2 OEP/ONE Oregonian Support (AP Tech Team) Operations Support Analyst, OEP/ONE Helpdesk Business Analysts, OPA2 1 Oregon Department of Human Services: 2023 -25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 5 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 143 OEP/ONE UAT Testing Coordinators, OEP/ONE Business Analyst, OEP/ONE Quality Control Analysts OEP/ONE Call ECWS, Mobile Bots , RPA, IVR OPA3 4 Oregonian Support (AP Team) Manager PEMB 1 OEP/ONE Statewide Model Support OPA1 5 OEP/ONE Operational Engagement Analysts OPA3 3 OEP/ONE Audit Coordinator OPA2 1 OEP/ONE Training Analysts OPA3 2 OEP/ONE Equity Analyst OPA3 1 OEP/ONE Community Engagement Analyst OPA3 1 OEP/ONE Training Development and Delivery Specialists TDS2 3 OEP/ONE Administrative Support AS1 2 OEP/CAM Business Analysts OPA3 2 The Applicant Portal Tech Team provides direct consumer and community provider support for individuals attempting to connect to the Applicant Portal. Federal Security requirements around RIDP create a burden for individuals to authenticate and create an account who do not hav e a credit history. The State has a process for manual review and verification and has utilized temporary staff to support this work. The ongoing demand for the Applicant Portal and support for providers is a critical area that needs to be resourced. The six positions will provide an opportunity to build out additional staffing with differentials for languages that are most used by callers besides English. Oregon also continues to define and increase our use of ONE. While the initial design of ONE allows f or eligibility to be done appropriately when information is entered in the correct fields, feedback from staff Oregon Department of Human Services: 2023 -25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 6 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 143 and from Oregonians around modifications to make it more intuitive to them and clear are focus points for building a better sustainable system. These OPA staff on this team will focus on the staff portion of that design, with Worker Portal actions getting more information and support based on Staff Centered Design, and our correspondence and Applicant Portal focused on a Human Centered Design. Oregon piloted testing processes late in the Integrated Eligibility project using staff in offices and adjusted the initial design that were proven effective by staff based on this methodology. T his investment will allow us to use that type of methodology again. Oregon has co ntinued to invest in the ONE system since the initial release. Like any system there needs to be continued maintenance and then investment to meet the ever -changing needs of Oregonians and programs. Oregon has implemented a chat bot that allows staff and Oregonians to ask questions on the application and have logic drive answers and collect data on questions and the usefulness of the response. Tens of thousands of people have asked questions and the s tate requires an analyst to review data and continue to work with the vendor to provide updated responses and support for this resource. SNAP funding was set aside due to Quality Control errors in SNAP previously identified to build out mobile supports to assist with common errors. The funding allows for initial implementation but needs ongoing support and maintenance of the solution and funding for staff support. The state is also looking at how we can continue to build out automation and use technology to solve the historic caseload and ongoing demand we see in our systems. We know as recessionary times come , demand for our services increases when funding is not as available. Robotic Automation Processes (RPA) and an Interactive Voice Response ( IVR) system for our phones will allow Oregonians to automate speci fic answers without having to talk to workers, process returned mail and use rules reducing tasks that require worker intervention. We need analyst support for this implementation. Finally, Oregon invested in an integrated solution for workflow related to emails, allowing processing of verification and items that are emailed to a central box and will allow people in Oregon to work and use this information. The funding was provided for the implementation but not for the ongoing support of this work and an a nalyst is needed for this work. Oregon Department of Human Services: 2023 -25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 7 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 143 Oregon has implemented ONE, yet staff and managers are still learning the new system. Their ability to drive work statewide, coordinate across offices, and use new technology is part of the change process, but so is understanding how to work together across agencies and prioritize historic volumes of work. ONE has a systematic process for prioritization of work but requires management and staff to coordinate and a review of demand centrally to ensure we are meeting expected outcomes and timeliness. These statewide workflow positions will support local offices and managers learning how to read the data and support the processes of scheduling and determining demand. Additionally, training efforts continue to be updated based on feedback and investments in training is critical for this work. These positions will support the review of training processes and applying new procedures based on feedback to better meet the needs of a changing workforce and systems. ONE also provides more data in new ways, which has brought the attention of several audits. Agency support for audits and responses requires staff to track across systems and state and federal audits and respond and coordinate efforts. Finally, ONE is a new system that individuals and community are still learning about. Engagement with community is critical to our success as we move from a siloed to an equality approach and then shift to an equity framework and pe rson-centered, outcome -based system. Dedicated staffing is critical to connect with community and partners. The CAM system has been essential to protecting the public from abuse during the pandemic. Further, the system is a pathway to an equitable abuse screening and an investigation system which allows us to understand and analyze demographic abuse information, ultimately better serving Oregon communities. Through the use of this system, screeners, investigators, licensor, background check personnel and decision makers access real -time information and perform work anytime and anywhere throughout Oregon. Allegations of abuse are projected to increase nearly 60 percent over the 10 next years . In 2021 the CAM system documented, 56,514 intakes and investigations, 13,631 serious incidents and 1 ,341 death reviews. Oregon Department of Human Services: 2023 -25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 8 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 143 The CAM system has been implemented, is in operations and maintenance (O&M) phase and provides on- going Service Desk assistance to 1, 351 end -users. The Service Desk team received 9, 397 inqui ries from users in 2021. In addition, the O&M team provides services to programs and systems users such as: analysis of system issues, incident management, system testing, data analysis, system refinement, vendor management and general system maintenance t o reduce security risk, ensures functionality, optimizes performance and system integrity.

In addition to rightsizing OEP ONE BIS staff, additional budget is needed to ensure these staff have the resources to complete the necessary development and operational stabilization work note d below. $12 million - 2023 -25 IT contract costs (Note: this cost is still being finalized). $2.1 million - One-time payment to IT vendor for final contract cost (payment held to make sure the vendor made certain upgrades within a multi -year warranty and the State agreed to authorize that payment upon the end of that period) $6.2 million - New/additional secondary software required related to the ONE system that were not included in the IT portfolio when the 20 21-2023 budget was set: (such as Puppet Configuration Manager, State Google Cloud Environment for Chatbot, Google reCAPTCHA, Robotic Process Automation (RPA) $4.5 million - One-time expense to transition the ONE server/infrastructure from EIS to Azure Cloud Services $600,000 - SOC audit costs Oregon Department of Human Services: 2023 -25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 9 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 143 $5 milli on - One-time costs to develop training material and actions necessary to improve actions and quality of learning across learning styles for adult learners, focusing on change management, equity, and providing continual education avenues to build out comfort in performing the duties in an integrated eligibility program.

Software Services include Government Cloud Service and Support, Event monitoring, Data Encryption, Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity plan. 3. How does this policy package help or potentially hinder populations that are disproportionately underserved? How does this policy package further ODHS 's three strategic goals for both the program and ODHS mission s? Improved and sustainable ONE system oper ational support helps ensure constituents will see accurate and timely eligibility determinations, which will result in better access to basic food, health, cash, and childcare benefits in some of the most critical individual and family situations. This al lows ongoing benefits, while also increasing equity and community engagement. The ability to capture REALD (Racial, Ethnicity, Language and Disability) , veteran information, implement new programs, provide emergency benefits, and have data that can be use d in emergency management and other systems are all available due to the implementation of ONE. The ongoing support is critical to building on this and stabilizing the system. Because of the Public Health Emergency , Oregon hasn't had the opportunity to us e the system as intended, as such, we expect to continue to need to stabilize the system as we move back to normal operating procedures. Oregon Department of Human Services: 2023 -25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 10 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 143 This also supports the safety and well -being of individuals allowing for coordination across children and senior systems for abuse investigations. Training resources and having staff comfortable to be able to provide answers allows individuals greater choice. People go to specific offices based on our designation of their expertise to populations or programs. However, the opportunity to do work online, over the phone, talk to someone in their native language or be served in an equitable fashion has not always been possible in these program -focused approaches. By shifting from program to people focused, we bring teams together based on shared outcomes around allowing choice and honoring Oregonians, so that people don't have to go to multiple offices, stand in different lines, and provide verification over and over again and bring the expertise across programs to meet people where they are. Quantifying results 4. What are the long -term desired outcomes? Our request would allow us to move off hardware -based servers to a cloud server -based system ; continue to maintain the multi -pronged disaster recovery process; build on actions to have change management, staff supports, and a designated staffing system for eligibility to do this work ; acknowledge inequities in our systems and builds infrastructure to engage with community and continue change across our systems ; and allow staff to process benefits for individuals in our state, keep phone and IT systems available, drive equity- based changes in our processes, engage with community and have the structur e to support community partners, providers, and staff. Oregon Department of Human Services: 2023 -25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 11 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 143 5. How will ODHS measure the impact on system and access inequities and/or impact disproportionality in accessibility and services in ODHS programs through this policy package? An appropriately supporte d benefit / service delivery system's impact would likely best be measured by the effectiveness of the program benefits themselves. Interested parties can see the effect of a system where benefits are not delivered timely or accurately in the health and sa fety outcome for the client and client families. How achieved 6. What actions have occurred to resolve the issue prior to requesting a policy package? ODHS approached the Legislature with a 2021 -23 POP asking for additional eligibility workers and staff support positions. The POP was not funded but began a conversation on right- sizing eligibility for the new ONE system with a promise of our returning with a rightsizing POP i n this session. During the interim, additional investments and adjustments have been made to the ONE system and the business processes. Further, LEAN principles are being applied and efficiency and effectiveness is being evaluated as we do our work. Howe ver, caseload has risen to a high of 880,000 and is expected to remain high anticipating 800,000 post pandemic. This is one -fourth higher than pre -pandemic caseload levels. 7. What alternatives were considered and what were the reasons for rejecting them? ODHS continues to work on system efficiencies, worker efficiencies, turnover, and absenteeism. These measures, though meaningful, will not close the gap. Oregon Department of Human Services: 2023 -25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 12 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 143 8. What other agencies, programs , community partners or stakeholders are collaborating on this policy package? We have been talking with community about this change for almost 20 years. These items and concerns are felt across communities and across Oregon and this will allow us to better serve our communi ties and ensure benefits and services can be provided with equity in the forefront, in more ways, timelier and with increased accuracy. 9. Does this policy package require any changes to existing statute(s) or require a new statute? If yes, identify the st atute and the legislative concept. No 10.

This program establishes contract s between local school districts and the VR program to deliver transition and employment related services to students with disabilities . Currently there are mo re than 200 s chool s participating in YTP . The goal of YTP is to assist students with disabil ities successfully transition from secondary school into postsecondary education or into competitive integrated em ployment . For many years VR has contract ed with the University of Oregon (UO) to provide training, evaluation , and technical assistance to the YTP school districts under contract with VR. Early in 2022 the Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) , VR's federal funders, came to Oregon to conduct a monitoring visit of the program . This was the first time in 12 years that R SA had been to Oregon f or a federal review. Oregon VR was informed at that time that the contract with UO did not meet some of the contrac tual standards and expectations set forth by RSA. The contract with the UO , as it exists today, is what is considered a sub- delegation of authorit y. In other words, Oregon VR has given too much oversight and supervision of YTP to a third party. RSA informed the program that VR mus t retain authority over our contractors and cannot contract out for those services. Technical assistance and eva luation o f our contracts with YTP school districts must be conducted and administered under VR 's authority and by VR staff. Therefor e, after June 30, 2023, VR will no longer be contracting with the UO for Technical Assistance , evaluation and monitoring of our YTP school contractors. This shift is specific to our working relationship with the UO and does not impact our contractual relationships with YTP schools , which are in place through June 30, 2023. 2023 -25 Ways and Mean s Page |2 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 1 48 Any needed adjustments to the YTP working relationsh ip or con tract will be addressed through the next biennium's contracting cycle. VR is working with ODHS leadership on a Policy Option Package to address the programmatic changes needed to respond to RSA 's guidance . Currently there is roughly $1.5M dedica ted to the contr act with U O in the 2021 -23 biennium . Moving into the next biennium VR will be requesting legislatively approved position authority to hire VR staff to complete the work of the U O contract. This will be a cost neutral request with no request for addi tion GF over the current CSL. This request will be for approximately 6 FTE that will provide the training, technical assistance , and evaluation of the YTP school dis tricts under contract with VR. This will bring VR into compliance with RSA.

This policy option package will allow the state to meaningfully improve health outcomes in communities who face historic and contemporary injustices, in alignment with Oregon Health Authority's goal of eliminating health inequities by 2030. ODHS is responsible for determining eligibility for state medical services, for the operation and maintenance of the ONE eligibility system, and for the delivery of long- term services and supports related to Medicaid. This policy package would fund ODHS for related costs if OHA- HPA -05 is approved , which will enable the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) to execute and implement the policy and program changes outlined in 1115 Medicaid demo nstration waiver and approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). These demonstrations occur within a specific time horizon and can be extended if necessary. This package would allow ODHS to fulfill the implementation obligation necess ary to review eligibility as required by the waiver. OHA is currently negotiating the next five -year 1115 waiver with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and expects that negotiations will likely not conclude until September 30, 2022.

Section 1115 of the Social Security Act gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services authority to approve experimental, pilot or demonstration projects that promote the objectives of Medicaid. Under this authority, the Secretary may waive certain provi sions of the Medicaid law to give states additional flexibility to design and improve their programs. Generally, section 1115 demonstrations are approved for an initial five -year period and can be extended for up to an additional three to five years, depe nding on the populations served. OHA has successfully used the 1115(a) demonstration since 1994 to innovate in health care system, improve care and lower costs, with the last waiver being renewed in 2017. The 1115 waiver is a unique chance for large -scale health system transformation in the Oregon Health Plan ( OHP ). Oregon's most recent waiver application was submitted to CMS February 18, 2022, for the 2022 -2027 demonstration period. The current waiver was set to expire June 30, 2022 but has been extended b y CMS to September 30, 2022. Negotiation with CMS is a blend of legal, financial, policy and the negotiation are uncertain and placeholder language regarding this waiver POP is needed for now. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 3 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 201 political dynamics. Approval of proposed waiver policy concepts are at the discretion of the federal government. Once agreed to, the G overnor must sign the approve d application in the 120 days after waiver approval. Implementation planning must be complete within six months of approval. OHA's waiver application is structured to align with OHA's priorities on eliminating health inequities, as well as clearly alignin g with other health policy initiatives in the state. OHA's updated goals and improvements for the state's Medicaid program build on past successes and reflect lessons learned from COVID-19. The proposed 1115 waiver demonstration and associated Policy Optio n Package will allow the state to meaningfully improve health outcomes in communities who face historic and contemporary injustices. ODHS is responsible for the eligibility related to these services, the operationalization of the ONE system for eligibility , and delivery of long-term services and supports related to Medicaid. This POP reflects those items related to the implementation of the 1115 that ODHS is aware of at this time and would be responsible for. ODHS is responsible for making sure the ONE system can implement and provide benefits in compliance with whatever is approved and agreed upon in Oregon within the timeframes listed above. ODHS is also responsible to make sure training and materials are pr ovided to the several thousand staff doing this work in a way that supports them understanding the impact on their work and those they serve. ODHS is responsible for the actual delivery of medical eligibility, performing this over the phone, in -person, and through electronic and paper applications for the current 1.3 million Oregonians receiving Medical, along with the additional individuals receiving food, cash, and childcare assistance. This initiative along with others will continue to maintain and potentially increase the historically high caseload, and so staffing will be needed. Additional staffing for hearings and quality assurance of the new services will be needed as well. Finally, the IT investments in the ONE system, with this Policy Option Pa ckage and other items need to be sequenced and within available resourcing. ODHS and OHA will be unwinding the Public Health Emergency during the period that multiple updates will be required, and so staff resources and subject matter experts from both ar eas need to be available Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 4 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 201 and considered when approving items to ensure we have contract hours and budget as well as staff available to make the necessary changes. 2. What would this policy package buy and how and when would it be implemented? As currently planned, the demonstration renewal will continue operating statewide covering 1.3 million people in Oregon currently receiving benefits through the OHP. This proposed demonstration more directly responds to the commun ity feedback collected through strategic planning processes and waiver engagement and continues building on the existing foundation of OHP to address health equity more intentionally. Focusing this waiver renewal application on meaningful progress towa rd health equity, along with clear alignment with other health policy initiatives in Oregon, allows OHA to improve health outcomes in communities most harmed by social injustices. To carry out this vision OHA is seeking to: Maximize continuous and equitable access to coverage . Streamline transitions between systems through defined benefit packages of social determinants of health services. Move to a value -based global budget. Improve health through focused equity investments led by communities. Ensure quality and access through equity-driven performance metrics. Align with Tribal partners' priorities. Upon approval by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the new waiver will require a significant legislative concept (LC) and po licy option package (POP) in alignment with the policy and program changes outlined in the waiver. OHA is currently negotiating the next five -year 1115 waiver with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and expects that negotiations will like ly not conclude until September 30, 2022. Therefore, precise outcomes of the negotiation are uncertain and placeholder language Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 5 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 201 regarding this waiver POP is needed for now. ODHS has estimates of costs associated with training, system changes to ONE, addit ional program costs for LTSS, and operational impact; but will need to wait until final language is back from CMS. 3. How does this policy package help or potentially hinder populations that are disproportionately underserved? How does this policy package further ODHS 's three strategic goals for both the program and ODHS mission s? While a 2018 independent evaluation of CCOs under Oregon's 1115(a) demonstration found that under CCOs, patient -reported health status improved, quality had improved whe n CCOs were paid for performance, cost growth was slowed, and access and patient satisfaction were maintained; the data shows there is more work to do. Specifically, Oregon must better address the health inequities disprop ortionately impacting communities of color. The facts and need are stark. In Oregon: American Indians and Alaska Natives and non- Latina /o African Americans are more than twice as likely to die from diabetes as non -Latina /Latino whites. Latino/a/x Oregonians comprise only 12 percent of the population but represent more than 1 8 percent of COVID -19 cases, and Black Oregonians are 3.1 times more likely to have a COVID- 19 associated hospitalization than their white counterparts. Non-Latina(o) African Americans have nearly twice the rate of avoidable deaths from heart disease, stroke, and high blood pressure as non- Latina(o) whites. American Indians and Alaska Natives have a much higher death rate from chronic liver disease than any other group. Oregon Healt h Plan members and community partners have regularly voiced the need for OHA to address health inequities both in the health system and in the communities where members live and work. The COVID- 19 pandemic brought this need into sharp focus as communities most harmed by social injustices were, and still Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 6 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 201 are, disproportionately harmed by this virus. These communities consistently report that lack of access to care and health resources was and is at the center of their struggle to stay safe and healthy. Oreg on Health Authority has established a strategic goal to eliminate health inequities by 2030. Given the facts cited above, along with myriad other examples of health inequities permeating the health care system, Oregon's 1115 demonstration waiver renewal is focused on pushing Oregon's Medicaid system to address health equity directly and systematically. Oregon Health Authority's policy concepts that are incorporated into the 1115 waiver renewal propose to: Maximize continuous and equitable access to covera ge It is only with continuous and equitable access to coverage that people can access the care they need to stay healthy. OHA knows that people of color and communities most harmed by social injustices have lower coverage rates. OHA's approach seeks to el iminate inequitable access with strategies to extend and stabilize coverage to every eligible child and adult in Oregon. This goal aligns with the State of Oregon's Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Action Plan in part due to eliminating inequitable access throughout Oregon. Streamli ne transitions between systems through defined benefit packages of the social determinants of health services Data show members of high- risk populations often lose coverage and access to care during life transitions and in transitions between systems such as incarceration or state hospital admittance. These disruptions come at great cost to the individual and to the system. By providing defined benefit packages to members in transition, OHA can ensure these Oregonians stay covered, have important social det erminants of health needs met and maintain access to care and medicine, which ultimately improves health outcomes. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 7 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 201 Move to a value -based global budget Compared to other states, Oregon has generated large savings from its approach to Medicaid. The CCO model is both innovative and cost-effective. To maintain and build on these successes, OHA must continue building a rate -setting methodology that rewards spending on health equity and improving the health of communities rather than spending on medical procedures and services alone. This focus on value within a global budget will further drive the health care system to spend on health, rather than health care ( for example , in the more traditional medical model). Improve health through foc used equity investments led by communities The health care system can do more to invest in community- based approaches to address social determinants of health that drive health inequity. With focused equity investments, OHA will redistribute both funds and decision- making power to local communities. Focusing on community-driven solutions enables OHA to use funding mechanisms to better address larger scale barriers to health and health equity. Ensure quality and access through equity -driven performance metr ics The CCO coordinated care model is built on incentivizing quality and access. OHP members and community stakeholders have continued to report that equity must be the focus across the system. By revising metrics to focus on traditional quality and access for downstream health while also creating a new set of equity- driven performance metrics for upstream health factors, OHA can make significant progress in driving the system toward more equitable health outcomes. These policy changes will deliver changes to OHP that address the same goals as the original 1994 waiver and subsequent renewals. Oregon is responding to and addressing the lessons learned during the past 10 years - particularly those raised directly by community partners, OHP members and Tribal partners - and those highlighted by the disparate impacts of COVID- 19. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 8 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 201 Quantifying results 4. What are the long -term desired outcomes? The long -term desired outcome is to improve health outcomes in communities most harmed by social injustices in alignment with achieving OHA's stated goal of eliminating health inequities by 2030. The key goals to address drivers of health inequities include: 1. Creat ing an equity- centered system of health. 2. Ensur ing access to coverage for all people in Oregon. 3. Encouraging smart, flexible spending that supports health equity . 4. Reinvest ing government savings across systems to achieve health equity. OHA heard from community that if those goals are achieved the system will look like: Create an equity -centered system of health No language, cultural or economic barriers to care Enrollment is preserved in OHP as patients transition between systems People experience streamlined, coordinated, and integrated care across health and social systems Easier to access and have Medicaid cover housing supports, social supports and pre -treatment services Enrolling a higher percentage of people who are eligible Reducing churn and providing better continuity of coverage Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 9 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 201 Ensure access to coverage for all people in Oregon Reducing/eliminating the inequity in the uninsured rate Encourage smart, flexible spending that supports health equity Seeing a shift in investments on the ground that focus on prevention and equity Provide a predictable rate of growth Financial power and decision -making on community investments is held by the community Patients would get the care and supports they need, regardless of whether it's a covered benefit Reinvest government savings across systems to achieve health equity Oregon enters into a shared savings agreement with the federal government Savings are reinvested into targeted areas to address health inequities Resources are invested to improve cross -system coordination 5. How will ODHS measure the impact on system and access inequities and/or impact disproportionality in accessibility and services in ODHS programs through this policy package? As required by CMS once the waiver renewal is in place, OHA will conduct a formal evaluation of the 1115 waiver's impacts. The evaluation will focus on three of the main components of the demonstration waiver: Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 10 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 201 1. Community Investment Collaboratives (CICs) , which are community- driven initiatives focused on eliminating health inequities. Oregon proposes to evaluate CICs using a collection impact framework (CIF). This evaluation will focus on both process and outcomes and will use a mixed method design. 2. Continuous enrollment , whi ch is a proposal to reduce the unnecessary cycling of members on and off Medicaid by extending continuous enrollment (CE) to any child on Medicaid up to age 6, and CE for two years to any person aged six and older. This evaluation will focus on the costs a nd outcomes of this policy change, and will use existing qualitative data, as well as collect quantitative data among members affected by the change. 3. Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) transition services, which are packages of services that will be available to people transitioning out of certain populations or settings (justice -involved, Youth with Special Health Care Needs, psychiatric residential mental health facilities), and to people who are homeless or at-risk, who are dually eligible, who are vul nerable to extreme climate events, or who are child welfare involved. Oregon proposes to evaluate the impact of SDOH transition services on two to three of these populations. This formal evaluation focuses on outcome measures, for example impact to Medicaid members, more so than process measures, for example improvements in system efficiency. How achieved 6. What actions have occurred to resolve the issue prior to requesting a policy package? Many of the policy proposals in the 1115 waiver have been of interest to OHA, Tribal partners and community members for years. However, due to the unique nature of an 1115 waiver to allow for the waiver of certain federal regulations, OHA and partners analyzed the options proposed and determined that action could not be Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 11 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 201 taken without an 1115 waiver . The 1115 waiver is only renewed and negotiated every five years and amendments are difficult. As such, action through the 1115 waiver was determined necessary to pursue these changes. In addition to pursuing a policy option package, OHA has explored eve ry way to maximize federal investment to cover the proposed costs of the 1115 waiver policies. This includes a request to the federal government for significant financial investment in the form of Designated State Health Program (DSHP) funds. OHA's origina l ask to the federal government was for $1.51 billion over the course of the five -year waiver demonstration. OHA and CMS are currently actively negotiating this number. Regardless of the exact final number, DSHP federal funds would represent a significant investment of funds focused on promoting health and health equity and eliminating health inequities in the state. 7. What alternatives were considered and what were the reasons for rejecting them? Doing nothing would assure that Oregon will not advance towar ds achieving OHA's 2030 goal eliminating health inequities and current inequities will continue. Furthermore, not moving forward with the policy option package could cause compliance issues that could result in: CMS either withholding funding or requiring payback of previously provided funding. Legal challenges from various populations not being served as federally required. Political issues and loss of community trust if OHA receives federal DSHP funds to support specific new policies and programs and does not make corresponding system changes to operationalize those programs. Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 12 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 201 8. What other agencies, programs , community partners or stakeholders are collaborating on this policy package? The new application responds to the community feedback OHA has received during the past five years and builds on the existing foundation of OHP to address health equity more intentionally, while aligning with the priorities of Oregon's Nine Federally Recognized Tribes and the Urban Indian Health Program . In addition to extensive public and community input, staff r eviewed the following existing strategic plans during the waiver development process: 2020 OHA Ombuds Program Report CCO 2.0 Community Engagement Report Oregon Health Policy Board (OHPB) 2021 Health Equity Recommendations OHA 2019 Strategic Plan for Community Engagement OHA 2019 Tribal Strategic Plan for Community Engagement State Health Improvement Plan COVID -19 Listening Sessions materials Community Partnerships OHA held multiple information sessions in English and Spanish through the Community Partner Outreach Program (CPOP), Oregon Health Policy Board (OHPB) , the Medicaid Advisory Committee (MAC) and the Health Equity Committee (HEC). All these forums welcomed public comments on the waiver. Further, the state held its official public comment period Dece mber 7, 2021-January 7, 2022. This included seven public meetings with public comment and people could also submit comment via survey, mail, or email. During state public comment, OHA heard from about 200 unique commenters on a variety of policy topics and the following policy changes were made to the waiver application because of these comments: Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 13 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 201 The waiver of the Early and Periodic Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) benefit for children was removed from the application. The waiver of retroactive eligibility was removed from the application. OHA clarified the request for HB 3353 expenditures to count as medical for purposes of rate setting (previously combined with other HRS requests for rates) . OHA added broadband services to transitions related to extreme climate events . OHA changed the number of upstream metrics proposed for its Quality Incentive Program from three to five to up to six. Partnership with the Nine Federally Recognized Tribes and UIHP In accordance with CMS requirements and OHA's Tribal Consultation and Urban Indian Health Program (UIHP) Confer Policy, OHA distributed a Tribal Leader l etter, which included an invitation for consultation, on November 29, 2021, to all of Oregon's Nine Federally Recognized Tribes and the UIHP. The 1115 Medicaid Waiver Tribal Consultation occurred via videoconference on December 14, 2021, from 1- 3 p.m., which was no fewer than sixty days before submission of the final Waiver language to CMS on February 15, 2022. In addition to meeting the requirements for Tribal Consultation, OHA partnered with the Tribes so that they were involved in and informed of the ongoing development of the state's 2022 -2027 1115 Waiver Application. This included regular updates at Tribal Monthly Meetings and SB 770 HHS Cluster Meetings, drafting a Tribal Concept Paper based on concerns raised previously by Tribal governments and working with the Tribes to develop this concept paper before inclusion in the application. Further, OHA me t with the Tribes in a series of meetings to further develop the policies proposed in the Tribal Concept Paper after waiver submission in preparation for a Q&A with CMS, to ensure all materials and responses reflected the intent of the Nine Federally Recog nized Tribes. OHA continues to update the Tribes and UIHP about the 1115 waiver at Tribal Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 14 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 201 Monthly Meetings, SB 770 HHS Cluster Meetings, and through email as appropriate. OHA staff are working to ensure that appropriate consultation happens with the Tribes and UIHP as policies move toward implementation. Coordinated Care Organizations (CCOs) In addition to receiving public comment from CCOs at public meetings and through state and federal comment, OHA has provided regular waiver updates to CCOs at the OHA CCO Leadership Policy and Strategy CCO Operations meetings. Additionally, OHA has regularly met with a subset of CCO CEOs to provide waiver updates and receive feedback. OHA has had additional meetings at the request of CCOs or those who represent them, i ncluding Coalition for a Healthy Oregon ( COHO ) and CCO Oregon. OHA also has met with Health Share of Oregon, whose pilot program on housing has informed the state's S ocial Determinants of H ealth (SDOH) Transitions Support work. Regional Health Equity Coalitions (RHECs) The proposal for Community Investment Collaboratives (CICs) was co- created with Oregon Regional Health Equity Coalitions (RHECs) through a unique community -driven process. In 2021, RHECs came to OHA with a proposal for the 1115(a) -demonstration waiver renewal and worked closely with the Oregon Legislature to inform the design of HB 3353. Subsequently, OHA and RHEC leadership worked closely to build out the intent of HB 3353 and increase accountability to community by emphasizing community role in identifying inequities and making investment decisions to address inequities. The OHA/RHEC workgroup met 12 times between May and July 2021 to develop strategies to develop a model for shifting power and resources to community. Recognizing that the process can be as important as the outcome, the work involved relationship and trust building, particularly to build increased trust between community organizations and government, Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 15 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 201 naming some of the values we hold in conducting work together thro ugh developing group agreements, sharing needs to successfully accomplish the work together, clarifying roles and scope of work, and agreeing on guiding principles to ensure the model was designed to achieve health equity goals, including investment in racial, cultural, and underserved communities. The OHA/RHEC workgroup has continued to meet through 2021 and 2022 to continue development of this proposal through negotiations with CMS. Partnerships with other state agencies OHA has worked with several state agencies to ensure success of the 1115 waiver demonstration, including ODHS, Oregon Department of Corrections (ODOC ), and Oregon Housing and Community Services ( OHCS ). ODHS has been involved in informing the work for Youth with Special Health Care Needs a nd the SDOH Transition Supports, as well as informing any needed changes to the ONE system. OHCS has been consulted on housing policy. ODOC has been consulted on providing eligibility and benefits for those in state prisons. 9. Does this policy package require any changes to existing statute(s) or require a new statute? If yes, identify the statute and the legislative concept. OHA submitted a legislative concept placeholder (LC 44300- 010), because the precise outcomes of the negotiations with CMS are uncertain. Items included in the placeholder currently include: Consistent with OHA's health equity goal and the policy concept outlined in the waiver application, language is needed to revamp the CCO Quality Incentive Program to equitably redistribute power. A new Health Equity Quality Metrics Committee (HEQMC) - composed of Oregon Health Plan (OHP) members, community members from diverse communities, individuals with lived experience of health inequities, health equity professionals and re searchers, and a representative of the Behavioral Health Committee - will lead the CCO Quality Incentive Program. o ORS 413.017 Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 16 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 201 Under its 1115 demonstration, Oregon is proposing to use funds freed up through designated state health programs (DSHPs) to fund bundles of services addressing social determinants of health (SDOH) for populations undergoing a transition (e.g., a transition between systems or a life transition). Funds for SDOH service packages would flow through CCOs through a non -risk contract in t he first three years of implementation and will be incorporated into CCO capitation in later years. OHA requires statutory authority/allowances for OHA to issue non -risk payments. o ORS 414.570 and potentially 414.025 (Definitions for ORS chapters 411, 41 3 and 414). 10. What other state, tribal, and/or local government agencies would be affected by this policy package ? How would they be affected? The SDOH transition services package mentioned above would impact counties and their jails, because as part of the 1115 demonstration renewal request, Oregon is seeking to cover a dults and youth transitioning out of the criminal justice system. This will include adults in custody (pre - and post- adjudication) of county jails or local correction facilities. The Ni ne Federally Recognized Tribes Formal consultation and ongoing engagement with the Nine Federally Recognized Tribes and UIHP is explained above. The proposed policies in the Tribal Concept Paper are based on request of the Tribes and would have significant impact in reducing health inequities for Tribal members. See question 8 for more details on the impacts to state agencies. 11. Is this policy package being requested because of an Oregon Secretary of State or internal audit? If so, provide further informat ion. No Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 17 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 201 Staffing and fiscal impact Implementation date(s): TBD End date (if applicable): TBD 12. What assumptions affect the pricing of this policy package ? OHA is assuming that CMS will approve at least some portion of the 1115 waiver application. 13. Will there be new responsibilities for another agency (OHA etc.) and/ or ODHS/OHA Shared Services ? Specify which programs and describe their new responsibilities. None identified but would have major IT impacts and prioritization of this work will take a large number of available hours and time. There may be new coding that needs to be established to track funding and participation. 14. Will there be changes to client caseloads Cost per Case or services provided to population groups? Specify how many in each relevant program. Yes, that will be determined based on CMS approvals . 15. Describe the staff and positions needed to implement this policy package, including whether existing positions would be modified and /or new staff would be needed. Yes, the size, amount, and type are depending on CMS approval.

More than one million Oregonians count on the state's current mainframe platform to receive their benefit and provider payments. The COBOL programming code on the mainframe system dates to the 1970s and is increasingly unsupported. Mainframe -proficient staff are shrinking in number and hard to replace, resulting in a variety of service and payment bottlenecks. If these problems are not resolved, there is increasing risk that the agency will be unable to make timely payments to Oregonians, potentially for an extended period. Oregon Department of Human Services and the Oregon Health Authority are therefore jointly requesting the resources necessary to upgra de our mainframe platform and ensure continuity of payments and benefits for the people we serve. It is critical that we migrate all current mainframe functions to more modern, ideally cloud -based solutions. Doing so will help avoid the risk of service breakdowns caused by old software, bring ODHS and OHA technology into alignment with peer agencies, improve flow across interfacing information systems, and allow Oregon to achieve full benefit from its investments in the ONE eligibility system. This investme nt proposes a strategy to plan for and Oregon Health Authority & Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 2 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 203 General Fund Other Funds Federal Funds Total Funds Pos. FTE ODHS 31 21.64 Purpose 1. Why does OHA /ODHS propose this policy package and what problem is OHA /ODHS trying to fix or solve? The agency's mainframe system dates from the 1960s. It has become a critical risk to delivering services to Oregonians and is limiting the agency's ability to respond quickly to changing needs. Over one million Oregonians receive benefits or provider payments via the mainframe. Mainframe systems are also used for provider authorization for over 40,000 care providers, and to deter mine eligibility for benefits to more than 11,000 Oregonians. The current payment system was designed by a single agency employee decades ago and is highly customized and unique to the state of Oregon. This staff member is the only individual with comprehe nsive knowledge of the functions within that system. If they retire or otherwise become unavailable, there is significant risk that payment processing for benefits recipients and providers could be impacted. implement a new payment system, move all remaining benefits currently determined on the mainframe to the ONE system, and develop a plan to decommission or archive remaining mainframe programs and data. Oregon Health Authority & Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 3 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 203 More widely, the mainframe represents an anachr onism at a time when the IT industry has shifted almost entirely to modern cloud platforms. It has become extremely difficult to replace staff as they retire from the mainframe team, and expanding the team is effectively impossible. 30 percent of the mainf rame team's 42 total positions are unfilled, and 50 percent of the current staff are already eligible for retirement or will be within five years. Almost no technology vendors still offer mainframe consulting, software, or services. The lack of staff to work on payments and other services that the mainframe supports has resulted in an increasingly visible bottleneck. The OregonSaves retirement plan was delayed for some homecare and personal care workers, in large part because of limit ed mainframe team capacity and a lack of modern development tools and practices. A lack of training environments on the mainframe have made it more difficult to train new and existing staff to support Oregonians. 2. What would this policy package buy and how and when would it be implemented? This project supports the planning and execution of steps necessary to migrate Oregon Department of Human Services (ODHS) and Oregon Health Authority (OHA) off the mainframe computing platform maintained and supported by their shared Office of Information Services (OIS). An investment in this work will constitute a multi -biennia effort. Limited mainframe team capacity has been a long -running concern for the agency and has impacted numerous key initiatives including ONE, Provider Time Capture (PTC), the transfer of the Employee Related Daycare (ERDC) program to the Department of Learning and Care (DELC) , and OregonSaves. This solution offers a new take on that challenge by focusing on addressing the fundamental, long- term issues rather than attempting to simp ly add more resources. The project approach has three strategic goals and phases: Oregon Health Authority & Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 4 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 203 1. Conduct requirements analysis and market analysis for a new payments system, identification, and acquisition of new payment systems High -level requirements and business processes are defined Market analysis of leading solutions is conducted Pilot program/process/area is identified 2. Move all remaining benefits processing and eligibility off the mainframe to ONE All benefits currently determined on the mainframe are determined in ONE 3. A decommissioning/archiving plan is defined for migrated mainframe programs and data. Migrate to the cloud, replace or decommission all remaining 'miscellaneous' mainframe programs. Evaluation and establishment of \"Tolerate, Invest, Migrate, Eliminate\" (TIME) posture toward remaining mainframe programs and data. This includes identifying data that has strategic value and determining a suitable archiving or warehousing location for it. 1.

How does this policy package help, or pot entially hinder, populations impacted by health inequities from achieving health equity1 or equitable health outcomes? How does this policy package further OHA's and/or ODHS's mission and align with its strategic plan? Migration and modernization of the mainframe environment will support an increase in benefit visibility to clients, and likely increase uptake of benefits, due to their integration into the ONE platform alongside other benefits. Additionally, clients will require less time to apply for all benefits, because the ONE platform facilitates a 'one stop shop' experience for an increased number of benefits. This proposal also reduces the risk of interrupting payments to members of all Oregonian communities and of delaying provider services to communities facing inequities. It also improves the agency's ability to respond to the changing needs of those communities. It will also make it easier to collect, store, analyze and use data to provide visibility of equity issues and improve service delivery to these communities. Finally, by increasing capacity it will help to avoid situations where the agency must prioritize one community's needs over another because it isn't possible to advance multiple efforts in parallel. Quantifying results 4. What are the long -term desired outcomes? This solution will make the agency more flexible and responsive to changing circumstances including federal regulations and policies, which increases trust, compliance, and public confidence. When completed, this project reduces the risk of interrupting payments to members of all Oregonian communities. It reduces the risk 1 Health Equity: When all people can reach their full potential and well -being and are not disadvantaged by their race, ethnicity, language, disability, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, soc ial class, intersections among these communities or identities or other socially determined circumstances. Oregon Health Authority & Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 7 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 203 of delaying provider services to communities facing inequities and improves the agency's ability to respond to those communiti es who are in the most need. Moving the remaining mainframe -based benefits determination processes to a modern, well -supported system will make it easier and faster to implement changes whether mand ated at the agency, state, or federal level. For the last several decades, payment systems have been commercially developed for large customer bases that are configured to meet the customer's needs. Furthermore, commercial payment systems are serviced by a multitude of third- party partners who can assist us with a wide variety of changes to help meet the demands of our communities, programs, legislators, providers, and partners. Locating these benefits programs in the ONE system would align with the systems 'one stop shop' ethos. Adopting modern systems to re place the current mainframe environment will produce significant secondary benefits which align with Strategy 8 of the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Action Plan: Diversifying the Workforce and Creating an Inclusive Workplace. This impact is expected bec ause modern systems rely on programming languages, and technological concepts for which there are broader and more diverse hiring pools. This is expected to open doors to applicants with skillsets in those areas. 5. How will OHA/ODHS measure the impacts on health inequities of this policy package? How will ODHS measure the impact on system and access inequities and/or impact disproportionality in accessibility and services in ODHS programs through this policy package? Anticipated outc omes from this solution include: The agency can more easily find resources to work on payments, and find them from multiple sources (vendors, consultants, open recruitment) Oregon Health Authority & Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 8 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 203 Benefits are more visible to the community, and there is increased uptake of them , due to their integration into the ONE platform alongside other benefits Clients require less time to apply for all their benefits, because the ONE platform facilitates a 'one stop shop' experience for an increased number of benefits Quantifiable outpu ts from this solution include: A new, vendor -provided payments system has been procured and installed The ONE platform determines eligibility for the 6+ benefits programs and 11,000+ Oregonians that are currently determined on the mainframe A solution has been identified for future provider authorization for 40,000+ providers Data on the success of this solution will be gathered from multiple sources: Internal recruitment and project staffing metrics ONE participation and client satisfaction metrics Metrics on the new payment system once implemented Moving to a modern, well- supported payment system will make it easier and faster to implement changes to payments, funding, federal reporting Table -Benefit and Measurement Benefit Measurement Reduce the risk of not being able to make payments to benefits recipients and care providers A new, vendor payments solution is in place with contractually defined service levels and support availability.

New requests are implemented more quickly Align technology with statewide modernization and cloud forward initiatives Mainframe solutions are replaced with cloud -based solutions, whether form vendors or internally developed How achieved 6. What actions have occurred to resolve the issue prior to requesting a policy package? Previous efforts to address the problem focused on adding more mainframe staff, procuring contractors, and utilizing system integrators rather than shifting to newer technologies. Those efforts have not been fully successful, as the IT industry has moved almost entirely away from the mainframe: there are simply not enough resources available in the market to meet the agency's n eeds. Experienced mainframe staff command very high wages, and the state's compensation is not competitive with other public and private sector IT employers. Given the lack of overall capacity, the agency has had to prioritize the limited capacity that is available, resulting in suboptimal outcomes. As noted above, OregonSaves was delayed for many care workers. And the agency is currently out of compliance with several federal reporting requirements. The mainframe staff 's work is prioritized through IT governance groups comprised of business and IT executives. Oregon Health Authority & Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 10 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 203 Two policy option packages (POP 203 -Critical Systems and POP 204-Modernization: Financial Payment Systems) were included in the 2021- 23 Agency Recommended Budget to start the work of planning in this critical area . Neither package was funded. 7. What alternatives were considered and what were the reasons for rejecting them? Status Quo Previous efforts to add ress the staffing problems focused on short-term, less costly solutions such as adding more mainframe staff, rather than shifting to newer technologies. Those efforts have not been successful, as the IT industry has moved almost entirely away from the mainframe. There are simply not enough resources available in the market to meet the agency's needs, address federal regulations, and new policies. Experienced mainframe staff command very high wages, and the state's compensation is not competitive with other public and private sector IT employers. There were two POPs (POP 203-Critical Systems and POP 204- Modernization: Financial Payment Systems) in the 2021-23 Agency Recommended Budget to start the work of planning in this critical area and both were denied. Continuing the status quo operation of mainframe systems will retain the risks identified above and over time will increase the risks accumulated with an aging and understaffed workforce. The risks of relying on antiquated, COBOL- based systems became highly visible nationally and in Oregon during the first year of the COVID pandemic; states were not able to rapidly make emergency payments, change benefits rules, and make other adjustments in payments processing. Another large Oregon agency struggled to issue pandemic -related assistance and was unable to scale up its systems to handle a large increase in claimants. The impacts of those issues caused by aging IT systems fell disproportionately on disadvantaged populations. Oregon Health Authority & Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 11 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 203 Failure to fund this investment wil l cause OHA, ODHS and OIS to pay increased costs for hardware maintenance. In 2022, Enterprise Information Services State Data Center informed its customers that it would no longer be able to operate mainframe hardware due to staffing issues. Instead, EIS is preparing to outsource hardware operation and maintenance to a managed service provider. If the project was not funded, the largest risk to Oregonians is around benefit and provider payments. With a reduced budget, we would prioritize the payments system replacement first, the ONE benefits migration second, and the provider authorization and other components third. We would defer the lower priority items to a later POP, while continuously seeking opportunities to find funding from other sources for the overall solution The risk profile for maintaining a status quo disposition toward mainframe programs was identified as 'not viable.' This alternative would not alleviate or mitigate risks identified in staffing, program specialization, system stability and agility and will most certainly result in increasingly disproportionate burden on Oregonian's that have been economically and socially marginalized. The high risk of failure to make payments will continue to grow, due to personnel/resource issues As m ainframe skills, resources and partners become less and less available, we will have more and more risks, delays, and constraints with mainframe -based solutions Do the Minimum Amount Possible There are a few identified approaches that incrementally addres s a better future than the \"do nothing\" or current state, but minimally: A. Reduce personnel risks by adding more positions to the team Oregon Health Authority & Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 12 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 203 Currently the mainframe team has 42 positions, of which 13 (30%) are unfilled. Recruitments routinely fail multiple times, and candidates do not possess the level of skills we need. The State Data Center is preparing to outsource its mainframe operations to an external partner because they cannot fill internal positions. B. Lift and shift (translate) mainframe code to anot her platform OIS engaged a partner to evaluate the feasibility of migrating the mainframe code to another platform (Microsoft's Azure cloud platform) Technically, a migration is feasible however it would have significant risks and limitations: C. The largest risk to Oregonians is around benefit and provider payments. With a reduced budget, the agency would prioritize the payments system replacement first, the ONE benefits migration second, and the provider authorization and other components third. We would def er the lower priority items to a later funding request and future biennium, while continuously seeking opportunities to find funding from other sources for the overall solution. This alternative is not viable. \"Lift and shift\" just moves the problem and doesn't fix the core issues: A direct migration to Azure doesn't address the issue that the payments system has been developed in- house and there is no wider expertise or other source of skills available. A direct migration doesn't provide any new or improved capabilities; the functionality remains the same. The cloud environment is new to the state; we haven't attempted anything close to the scale and complexity of running the current mainframe workloads on Azure. There would be a very high ris k of technical and process failures due to our lack of cloud maturity. Adding positions does not address the current inability to competitively pay, attract and hire mainframe skilled staff. Oregon Health Authority & Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 13 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 203 Migrate Mainframe Programs [desired solution] This solution wil l require investment for the following: To procure and install the new payments system To pay the ONE system vendor to implement additional benefits programs in ONE To hire additional technology staff to create and operate a cloud environment capable of ho sting the new payments system, and other components that will move off the mainframe To pay for technical consulting and implementation work, to move mainframe services to the cloud To procure training and modern software tools for our current mainframe te am, to help them transition to current technologies This project promotes shared, reusable solutions that can be adopted by multiple service areas. Although not in the scope of this effort, a new payments solution could become the default for other new initiatives that have a payments component. Having a robust, well supported, industry -standard solution available means the agency can avoid developing individual solutions for different service areas. Similarly, moving benefits determination from the m ainframe to ONE increases its value to Oregonians as a single place to identify the benefits they're eligible for. That in turn encourages current and future benefits programs to use ONE rather than develop their own eligibility processes and tools. From the IT perspective, adopting more modern and standard solutions expands the range of resources that can be applied to projects and other initiatives. Work that can only be done by the mainframe team today will be easier to assign to other technical specialists in the future. This solution is the most viable and sustainable of those considered. Oregon Health Authority & Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 14 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 203 8. What other agencies, programs, community partners or stakeholders are collaborating on this policy package? OIS, ODHS, OFS . We have also engaged with the State CIO's office, including the State Chief Technology Officer and Data Center Services (DCS). DCS operates the mainframe hardware in the State Data Center for those agencies that still use it. The ODHS CIO along with the state CTO is forming a workgroup wi th other agencies still on the mainframe to coordinate and ensure we provide the state an overall approach to moving off the mainframe. 9. Does this policy package require any changes to existing statute(s) or require a new statute? If yes, identify the statute and the legislative concept. No. 10. What other state, tribal, and/or local government agencies would be affected by this policy package ? How would they be affected? The mainframe is not directly visible to Tribes or other community members, and as su ch we have not solicited Tribal or community input on what they believe would be suitable technologies to replace it. The Service Employees International Union (SEIU) has expressed concerns in the past about initiatives like OregonSaves that have been delayed and had an impact on their members. The union has sought assurances from the agency that we will take steps to ensure we can meet commitments to its members within agreed timeframes. This solution recognizes those concerns and aims to address them by shifting to more modern technical platforms where we can add resources more easily and respond more quickly to changing needs. Oregon Health Authority & Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 15 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 203 11. Is this policy package being requested because of an Oregon Secretary of State or internal audit? If so, provide further information. No. Staffing and fiscal impact Implementation date(s): 7/1/2023 End date (if applicable): 12. What assumptions affect the pricing of this policy package ? Limited mainframe team capacity has been a long -running concern for the agency and has impacted numerous key initiatives including ONE, PTC and OregonSaves. This solution offers a new take on that challenge by focusing on addressing the fundamental, long -term issues rather than attempting to simply add more resources. The three elements of the POP are somewhat independent of each other, and work can proceed on them independently. However, resources are a constraint in all areas and may limit flexibility. ONE system governance approves and prioritizes migration of benefits determination from the mainframe to ONE. The Mainframe governance process approves and prioritizes the migration of mainframe benefits determinations. Both agencies stop all new development and enhancement work on the mainframe and allow only essential incident responses and bugfixes when necessary for new project timeline and resource success. The agencies allow new functionality to be developed only in the cloud, accepting that this will i ncrease time to delivery and costs during the migration period. Oregon Health Authority & Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 16 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 203 Microsoft's Azure cloud is the target platform for migrating mainframe programs and data. The current mainframe team does not have the capacity and modern technology skills to execute a migrat ion to more modern platforms, therefore additional resources will be required. Cost of professional services is assumed to be in alignment with other comparable efforts. Costs of staffing is assumed to be relatively consistent. Resources (both internal t o the agency and externally/vendors) with the necessary skills will be available Only Deloitte can implement new functionality in the ONE system. The start of the new ONE O&M contract in July 2023 does not adversely impact work in progress. This solution c hallenges the assumption that the mainframe issue is not yet critical, and that the agency can defer addressing it in favor of other priorities. This solution applies lessons from numerous other state agencies, states, and private entities that have moved off their mainframes because of high costs and limited resources. This solution anticipates demographic and retirement trends in the aging mainframe team. 13. Will there be new responsibilities for OHA , ODHS, and/or Shared Services ? Specify which programs and describe their new responsibilities. ODHS will lead the migration project, including overseeing of contractors, procurement, and implementation of new software solutions with support from OIS . OHA staff will participate in business requirement s gathering and supporting the migration to ensure ongoing services are not disrupted. 14. Will there be changes to client caseloads or services provided to population groups? Specify how many in each relevant program. Oregon Health Authority & Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 17 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 203 It is not anticipated that this project will affect client caseloads, however it will ensure payments are not interrupted, and benefits determination will be more easily accessible by Oregonians. 15. Describe the staff and positions needed to implement this policy package, including whether existing positions would be modified and /or new staff would be needed. The Office of Informati on Services is requesting a total of 19 new positions to support implementation of a new payment system and migration of the mainframe. These positions include Information System Specialists, Operations & Policy Analyst, a Project Manager, a Fiscal Analyst, and a Principal Executive Manager and Administration Specialist. ODHS is requesting at total of 10 new positions. These positions include Operations & Policy Analysts to support testing requirements of the APD and SSP legacy systems related to the migration efforts, including the mainframe-based payment system , as well as an Accountant, Project Managers, and a Training & Development Specialist to support migra tion. Two OPA3 staff will support OHA's Health Systems Division in the migration to a new solution as it relate s to integrating with MMIS and other existing OHA systems . 16. What are the start -up and one -time costs ? Contractor services to plan for and support migration of services off the mainframe. Additionally, staff to design and build a cloud environment that will host the migrated services. 17. What are the ongoing costs? Staff to support new technology environments, and software and service costs for selected solutions to replace the mainframe. Oregon Health Authority & Oregon Department of Human Services : 2023-25 Policy Package 2023 -25 Ways and Means Page| 18 Oregon Department of Human Services POP 203 18. What are the potential savings? Once the mainframe has been completely migrated to new environments, we expect to save on staff costs for operating the mainframe as well as t he current total cost of operating the mainframe. This is an expected savings of approximately $6.15 million per year. 19. What are the sources of funding and the funding split for each one? The main funding sources will be Medicaid matched with state funds. OHA, OIS , SAEC total for this policy package General Fund Other Funds Federal Funds Total Funds Pos.

However, it does create a risk within the 2023-25 budget where inflation would cover naturally increasing costs in service of care. Such reduction could impact capacity and access for Medicaid eligible older adults and people with disabilities. 7/1/2023 Y Y CW Eliminating office expense by 12.5% (674,307) - (140,839) (815,146) - - Cutting this budget will create unintended consequences to field operations and the ability to complete work efficiently and timely.

The current Oregon time limit is 60 months and state statute allows for only the adults needs to be removed from TANF once the 60 month limitation has been reached and the family has no hardship exemption. Oregon's policy provides for the children in the home to continue to receive TANF. For families who have reached the new time-limit, the entire case would close. Some families may see an increase in SNAP benefits as cash benefits end. Ending TANF cash benefits for the entire family may result in family instability and homelessness. Families would have to rely on other community based safety net programs which have already experienced increased demand. During the biennium an average of 1,298 families are expected to be impacted. Families will also be impacted if they come from another state and the accrued time (alone or in combination with Oregon accrued time) equals to or exceeds 60 months. This action requires an amendment to ORS 412.079. *This reduction will reduce the amount of state expenditures that count toward its MOE obligations. 10/1/2023 N N VR Reduce by 5% GF GL Based GB MEGATRACKER of 23-25 ; The proposed ONE-TIME reduction would result in a 5% decrease in case services potentially forcing the creation of a waitlist. 835 individuals would not receive services, including youth served under intergovernmental agreements with local school districts.

The standard payment for SSI recipients is $841. There would be a small percentage (<5%) or so that would be eligible due to special circumstances and receive a reduced TANF Payment. Cases closed due to over-income limit would be approximately 307, and 801 cases will have reduced pa yment. SSI 100% has the same impact as 50%. Therefore, there is only one cut at 50%.

The remaining 5% would result in a lower payment amount, as the income they count would be counted dollar for dollar, and reduce their TANF payment by that amount, which also results in a savings. This reduction will reduce the amount of state expenditures that count toward its MOE obligations. This would be a separate reduction, as we already count these families in the Time Limit Reductions. Budget Note: This is TANF Basic only since NNCR UN reductions captured in other reduction item for UN program elimination. 10/1/2023 N N APDReduce the complex medical add-on for nursing facilities by 40% (Assumes that rates are paid at the current statutory level) (35,374,264) - (2,816,422) (55,690,057) (93,880,743) - - This reduction would eliminate half of the 40% premium paid to nursing facilities that serve individuals with certain complex medical conditions.

Education needs are a part of the collaboration with ODE which offset the total costs. This also includes assisting parents in need of transportation support to attend child visitation, and treatment services primarily through public transportation means. Reduction in transportation support will negatively impact a child educational outcome and increase the departments legal liability to meet these needs. A child or parent unable to visit will reduce family reunification opportunities and will likely require a longer stay in foster care and may move toward higher cost processes (personal cost to the clients and financial cost to the state) toward termination of parental rights (ASFA) requirements. 7/1/2023 Y I-DD Eliminate Family Support Program (1,083,237) - - (1,083,237) - - This program provides a small amount of support that goes a long way to helping family with care of child with developmental disability.

Oregon has always struggled with having statewide resources and a statewide model that can be easily replicated with community support. Foster Parent Night Out is proven model design in Oregon with low cost and high impact for the foster families and foster children in care. A 10% reduction would eliminate some of the counties who operate this program to cease operation due to the already marginal budgetary support. Resource families need this necessary support to decrease burnout and turnover. 7/1/2023 Y APD Reducing Indirect Cost from 17.15% to 15.15% (updatedfor GB) (2,917,801) - (2,106,788) (5,024,589) - - Reduce the % applied for administrative overhead for AAAs which can compromise their effective delivery of services. 7/1/2023 Y N CW Other Medical: 15% reduction 1 of 4 (906,790) (3,706) - (910,496) - - Other medical funding is intended to support health care treatments and/or procedures needed by children in foster care that are not covered by Oregon Health Plan. In addition, funds are used by ODHS to obtain health care evaluation services which include case consultation with licensed health care experts, and psychological evaluations and other testing of parents (including drug testing), used to inform case planning. Services assist caseworkers in making informed case planning decisions for the child and family and to better inform the Courts. These services are delivered by local community health care providers. A 15% reduction will end our ability to provide this support for children resulting in unmet health care needs of children, negatively impacting foster parents' ability to care for the child and decreasing the informed case management planning with the family. 7/1/2023 Y APD Reduce PACE - PEP and AllCare by 1% (maintains MOE) -2% Total reduction- needbetter title (1,926,730) - - (2,772,611) (4,699,341) - - Reducing PACE rates may result in decreased access for Medicaid consumers and threaten efforts to expand PACE to more areas of the state. 10/1/2023 Y N 2023-25 Ways and Means 5Oregon Department of Human Services Reduction List2023 - Detail of Reductions to 2023-25 Current Service Level Budget 4 5 6 7 8 10 12 13 14 15 SCR or Activity Initials Program Unit/Activity Description GF LF OF FF TOTAL FUNDS Pos.

This service provides job coaching supports to about 1,800 individuals with a goal to support competitive employment. Providers of job coaching are part of the workforce crisis. There is a severe shortage of job coaching providers, especially in the rural areas. COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted employment providers, especially due to initial closures of community businesses. Even as businesses have reopened, there are individuals with I/DD who report having to forego employment opportunities due to shortage of providers of job coaching. Cuts to job coaching rates would further exacerbate job coaches shortages and may cause individuals with I/DD to lose jobs or be unable to take on employment opportunities due to lack of needed supports. 7/1/2023 Y N APD Reduce Social Isolation Funding by 50% (1,595,311) - - (1,595,311) - - A new service was added in 2021 specifically to address loneliness and social isolation for older adults and people with disabilities.

Case Management Entities (CMEs) provide critical supports to individuals with I/DD. Community Developmental Disabilities Programs (CDDPs) conduct eligibility and enrollment, provide case management, do foster care licensing reviews and perform adult protective services. Support Services Brokerages provide case management to adults who live in their own or family homes. CMEs are critical to ensuring individuals gain access to needed supports and monitor for service efficacy. Reduction to workload model funding to CDDPs and Brokerages will cause loss of capacity for CMEs needed to perform these critical functions and will result in negative outcomes for individuals with I/DD. CMEs also play vital role in ensuring compliance with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) federal rules. Reduced capacity at CME level may result in reduced compliance with CME standards and place federal funding at risk 7/1/2023 Y N APD Eliminate Sequestration to AAA's (2,429,915) - - (2,429,915) - - This would eliminate the sequestration funding given to AAAs to offset the effects of the federal sequestration on Older Americans Act programs. This will limit the AAAs ability to provide services such as home delivered meals to older adults. 7/1/2023 Y N I-DD Reduce all non-bargained In Home Provider Rates (77,811,517) - (143,446,493) (221,258,010) - - Reduce all non-bargained In Home Agency provider rates.

This daily rate is well below the average cost of raising a child in Oregon. In 2011 a 10% rate reduction occurred and had very negative impact resulting in foster parents deciding to end their fostering service, deciding this was the last straw of no respect from the legislature. In other states Washington and California have both had litigation brought before them as a result of their inadequate foster care rates. In fact, there is direct recommendation and legislative asks to increase foster care rates to better match other states and match to the cost of raising a child in the state. 7/1/2023 Y CW GA estimated cost per case (rate reduction) on new GA cases duetoreducedFC Rates. 15% reduction1of 3 (700,891) - (826,447) (1,527,338) - - Assumes negotiated rates will decline for new guardianship assistance cases as a function of the foster care rate reduction. 7/1/2023 Y I-DD Transition Supported Living to In Home Agency Rates (1,282,671) - (2,329,905) (3,612,576) - - Assumes negotiated rates will decline for new guardianship assistance cases as a function of the foster care rate reduction. 4/1/2025 Y N APD Reduce Adult Foster Care bargained rates by another 3%, (5.5% total) (2,138,710) - - (4,002,643) (6,141,353) - - Reducing Adult Foster Care rates may result in decreased access for Medicaid consumers.

Services are designed to ensure a safe environment for children without removing them from their parent or caregiver. In addition, services may be provided to assist in the reunification process to further mitigate concerns of safety for the child. A 15% reduction will reduce the departments ability to provide necessary services to keep children in-home which may in turn require an increase in the number of children entering foster care. ISRS provides services to 7,633 children and families per year. 7/1/2023 Y N I-DD Eliminate Relief Care services (639,102) - (1,160,898) (1,800,000) - - These services were not reduced from the authorized hours so reduction of this service will have minimal offset.

They provide free training to caregivers and first responders. They have trained thousands of individuals. Without this funding, the quality of care that individuals receive will be diminished. It is also likely that family caregivers will not be able to provide the care needed by their loved ones and will need to turn to paid care, including seeking Medicaid. 7/1/2023 Y N CW Strengthening, Preserving, and Reunifying Families: 15% reduction1of 4 (3,342,683) - - (3,342,683) - ORS 418.575 through 418.598 creates Strengthening, Preserving, and Reunifying Families (SPRF) as programs to serve families involved in the child welfare system. The goal of these programs is to foster collaborations between state and community programs and resources, to help maintain children to remain safely with their families. Services created through these collaborations are centered on housing, mentoring, system navigation, parent education and front-end intervention (early) as the primary services. A 15% reduction will either reduce the 998 children and families to be served. 7/1/2023Y N APD Eliminate Mental Health Funding (2,263,533) - - (2,263,533) - - This would eliminate the funding for local organizations to provide evidence-based mental health services to Oregonians and OHSU contract evaluating MH program. 7/1/2023 Y N APD Reduce HCW Benefit Contributions by 25% (10,086,629) - (18,732,310) (28,818,939) - - The state currently contributes to trusts that provide benefits and training to homecare workers.

They provide direct service navigation and substance abuse recovery support to parents whose children are in foster care. Peer mentors are an evidence-based strategy that positively impacts parent participation in case planning and ultimately reducing the length of time children are in foster care. This is a community-based service delivered by local service organizations. A 10% reduction in this service delivery could negatively impact parents and their children by delaying the necessary engagement with parents toward recovery and other supports, and may increase the length of time in foster care. 7/1/2023 Y I-DD Eliminate ability to disregard parental income (CAP ChildrenWaiver) (38,096) - (69,198) (107,294) - - CAP Waiver; Waitlist any child not qualifying due to parental income for children with IDD under age 18 who live with family.

This could impact numbers above. Pricing includes the cost of 3 OPA3s for a 12 month period. Under this reduction, children that require parental income disregard to meet Medicaid financial eligibility requirements will loose Medicaid eligibility and Medicaid funded services. This reduction will require CMS approval and may have ADA/Olmstead legal implications. ODDS estimates 1,070 children are estimated to lose eligibility due to this change during the biennium. 4/1/2025 Y N I-DD Reduce Adult 24 Hour Residential (61,825,978) - (113,699,287) (175,525,265) - - Reduce Adult 24 Hour rates. Group homes provide 24/7 support to over 3,100 people with IDD across the state and these rates pay to recruit and retain direct support staff for these homes. Reductions to funding to agency providers will exacerbate workforce shortage by: 1.Necessitating reductions in DSP wages and benefits providersare able to pay resulting in further destabilization of workforce and loss of staff 2.Increased health and safety risks for individuals receiving services due to lack of staff or staff turnover, unmet needs (including housing) and inadequate supports 3.Closure of programs and reductions in provider capacity to support individuals in all settings 4.Reduction number of homes and placement options available to individuals, especially those with highest levels of need With the new service groups and rate models in place, targeted reductions would be taken to achieve the reduction amount, we would not implement this as an across the board cut. 7/1/2023 Y N All Agency Additional Other Funds reductions to meet reduction target - TBD (44,722,909) (44,722,909) - - Original 10 list repriced and (581,630,801) $ (1,445,234)$ (57,507,834)$ (840,620,709)$ (1,481,204,578)$ 23 (233.39) 2023-25 Means 9Oregon Department of Human Services Reduction ListPROPOSED SUPERVISORY SPAN OF CONTROL REPORT In accordance with the requirements of ORS 291. 227, the Oregon Department of Human Services presents this report to the Joint Ways and Means Committee regarding the agency's Proposed Maximum Supervisory Ratio for the 2023- 2025 biennium. Supervisor Ratio base d o n CHRO data: The agency actual supervisory ratio as of is 1: 10.12 as of the July 1, 2021, DAS Agency Span of Control 8th quarter repor t. As of the May 31, 2022, Workday report, the ODHS Actual Agency Span of Control showed at 1: 10.76. (Agency actual supervisory ratio excludes board & commission employees/positions , additional job records for job rotations and work out of class, and agency head as indicated in the chart below. Otherwise, it includes all W orkday records for permanent, limited duration, temporary, contingent workers, volunteers, and employees with second jobs, that are both filled or vacant.) When determining an agency maximum supervisory ratio all agencies shall begin of a baseline supervisory ratio of 1:11, and based upon some or all of the following factors m ay adjust the ratio up or down to fit the needs of the agency.

Y/N Yes Explain how and why this factor im pacts the agency maximum supervisory ratio upwards or downward from 1:11 - ODHS is responsible for the safety of many vulnerable Oregonians in Child Welfare, Self Sufficiency, Aging and People with Disabilities, Individuals with Intellectuals Disabilities and Vocational Rehabilitation programs. Due to safety concerns and industry best practices in both Child Protective and Adult Protective Services a higher than 1:11 MSR is appropriate. ODHS has many supervisors that are working clinical supervisors respo nsible for the supervision of case managers that have an industry standard much higher ratio than 1:11 in order to maintain the safety of Oregonians and keep reasonable workloads. ODHS houses the Stabilization and Crisis Unit (SACU) a series of 24/7 homes for people with developmental or intellectual disabilities who are in crisis . A ratio of 1:11 is not ideal for this unit, due to the acuity of the clients in the home s and the fact that currently O DHS has supervisors that cover more than one house. 1:7 is a more reasonable target for a supervisory ratio and O DHS is using this as its \"target\" ratio for SACU employees who are now all in the police and fire designation due to difficulty, stress and potential danger of the positions working with difficu lt clients. RISK TO PUBLIC/EMPLOYEE SAFETY GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION(s) OF SUBORDINATES COMPLEXITY OF DUTIES/MISSION BEST PRACTICES/INDUSTRY STANDARDS AGENCY SIZE/HOURS OF OPERATION NON AGENCY STAFF/TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 2023-25 Ways and Means Page|2 Oregon Department of Human Services Max Supervisory ReportIs geographical location of the agency's employees a factor to be considered in determining the agency maximum supervisory ratio? Y/N Yes Explain how and why this factor impacts the agency maximum supervisory ratio upwards or downward from 1:11 - ODHS has over 1 54 office locations statewide including many smaller offices in very rural parts of Oregon. (The number of buildings was reduced by consolidating some older, smaller offices into newer, larger offices ; and, it does not include the 21 houses staffed by the Intellectual & Dev elopmental Disabilities (IDD) Stabilization and Crisis Unit (SACU) staff.) However, m any supervisors must travel long distances to interact with their staff and have smaller offices. Because of these geographic limitations a higher than 1:11 MSR is approp riate. ODHS has , without double -counting staff, 2,190 employees /positions (2,010 non -supervisors and 180 supervisors) in non -urban settings . Of these areas , the ratio s range from 1: 11.25 and 1: 16.15. O DHS believes a reasonable target ratio for these rural areas should be 1:8. The remaining urban employees are proposed to be 1:11 , where they are currently running at 1: 10.77. (This does not include C hild Welfare (C W) staffing mentioned in the child welfare section of the \"industry standards\" section , Aging & People with Disabilities (APD) or IDD SACU staff .) 2023-25 Ways and Means Page|3 Oregon Department of Human Services Max Supervisory ReportIs the complexity of the agency's duties a factor to be considered in determining the agency maximum supervisory ratio? Y/N Yes Are there industry best practices and standards that should be a factor when determining the agency maximum supervisory ratio? Y /N Yes Explain how and why this factor impacts the agency maximum supervisory ratio upwards or downward from 1:11 - ODHS is comprised of 5 major programs the smallest of which is over $1 48 million TF, t he largest is over $ 5 billion TF. In addition to C entral Services , ODHS also houses Shared S ervices that support both O DHS and OHA. In each major program area there are multiple sub -programs that must be managed , each with its own set of complexities from federal reporting to limitations on how grants can be spent to complex eligibility determinations. In addition, each of these programs have impacts on each other making the interaction and complexity of O DHS much higher than most agencies. In many parts of the agency , supervisors are responsible not just for the management of staff, but also for policy and procedure questions and providing final guidance on how cases ar e managed. In other words, they are working supervisors , not just supervisors. This is the case in most of O DHS as there are very few supervisory positions that don't also do policy or technical work in addition to their supervisory duties. There is als o a concerted effort to work across programs to become more focused on wrapping services around families for better outcomes at the lowest level. For O DHS , working across programs is like working across agencies , due to the size and complexity of the curr ent 5 major program areas. The smallest \"program area\" in ODHS is larger than most state agencies. ODHS also houses Shared Services that support both O DHS and OHA this means juggling the needs of each organization for tasks like accounting and overpaymen t recovery. This adds to the complexity of the organization. Th ese two factors justify a higher MSR than one to eleven. Explain how and why this factor impacts the agency maximum supervisory ratio upwards or downward from 1:11 - Child Welfare working supervisors, based on a January 2018 Casey Family Programs issue brief entitled Healthy Organizations (citing both Child Welfare League of America. (n.d.) Standards of excellence for child welfare services. Retrieved from http://www.cwla.org/our- work/ c wla- standards -of-excellence/standards -of-excellence- for-child -welfare -services and the Council on Accreditation. (n.d.) Standards for public agencies: PA- PDS 3: Leadership support of supervisors. Retrieved from http://coanet.org/standard/ pa-pds/3/, para. 7), have an industry best practice of 1:5 -1:7 for supervisors providing clinical support to caseworkers. This is in additio n to their supervisory duties. O DHS is using 1:5 as the target ratio. Adult Protective services, based on a 2017 National Adult Pro tective Services Association nationwide survey the average ratio of caseworkers to supervisors in Adult Protective Service programs is 1:5.65 . This report was concluded on September 30, 2019, and p ublished as a Final Report to the Administration for Commu nity Living (ACL). The recommended discuss ing the complexity and factors needing consideration when setting the APS supervisory ratios are also further outlined in the ACL Guidelines (National Voluntary Consensus Guidelines for State Adult Protective Serv ices Systems, pages 18 and 19), which was updated in March 2020. Another point of consideration included a Rider Report from Texas, showing their span of control ratio for APS workers. Vocational Rehabilitation also has working supervisors that provide clinical supervision. In all three cases these managers are also doing case worker clinical type supervision of the actual work not just \"supervising\" employees. All three cases justify a higher ratio than 1:11 due to clinical supervision duty needs that help with the overall safety of the se vulnerable populations. 2023-25 Ways and Means Page|4 Oregon Department of Human Services Max Supervisory Report Is size and hours of operation of the agency a factor to be considered in determining the agency maximum supervisory ratio? Y/N Yes Are there unique personnel needs of the agency, including the agency's use of volunteers or seasonal or temporary employees, or exercise of supervisory authority by agency supervisory employees over personnel who are not agency employees a factor to be considered in determ ining the agency maximum supervisory ratio? Y/N Yes Explain how and why this factor impacts the agency maximum supervisory ratio upwards or downward from 1:11 - ODHS Child Welfare fully staffs the 24-hour Oregon Child Abuse Hotline (ORCAH) , which justif ies a higher MSR than 1:11. O DHS is also reviewing its field structure and footprint and may be moving to more smaller locations across the state which may change the geographic footprint of the agency. In addition, O DHS runs a 24/7 crisis service through the Stabilization and Crisis Unit (SACU). This provides services to those with Intellectual and/or developmental disabilities in crisis. There are 812 positions at SACU with some supervisors having to cover multiple houses and as necessary providing direct services to clients to ensure proper staff to client ratios based on the needs of the client. Staffing ratios have been below 1:11 which is not a reasonable ratio considering the acuity of clients and the 24/7 nature of the business. SACU should be at a higher ratio such as 1:7 to be more appropriately staffed in a 24/7 environment. Explain how and why this factor impacts the agency maximum supervisory ratio upwards or downward from 1:11 - ODHS has over 118 volunteers , and many contractors , that need some level of supervisio n. This justifies a higher ratio than 1:11. In addition, all supervisors but the Director have supervisors and supervisors should be included as supervised employees in the denominator of the calculation . This would also justify a higher than 1:11 MSR. This sh ould be taken into consideration on the ASR calculation but is not currently part of the calculation of the ASR. 2023-25 Ways and Means Page|5 Oregon Department of Human Services Max Supervisory ReportIs the financial scope and responsibility of the agency a factor to be considered in determining the agency maximum supervisory ratio? Y/N Yes Based upon t he described factors above the agency proposes a Maximum Supervisory Ratio of 1: 8.47. Unions Re quiring Notification: SEIU; _________________________________________ Date ____________________ Explain how and why this factor impacts the agency maximum supervisory ratio upwards or downward from 1:11 - ODHS is responsible for serving close to 2 million Oregonians per year (which is almost half of the state's total population of 4. 32 million individuals) encompassing over $1 7 billion -dollar Total Funds in the 2 021-23 Legislatively Adopted Budget . This com es with more than 163 funding streams , each with their own limitations, rules and reporting requirements. There are 5 major program areas each bigger than most agencies. Within each program are multiple sub -programs again each with their own rules, funding sources and complexities. Most of this funding is spent in the community through hundreds of contracts, thousands of providers and multiple interagency agreements. Each program comes with its own eligibility criteria, usually having multiple different factors. Each sub-program usually has its own set of eligibility criteria and there is not continuity between program eligibility due to federal regulations. Employees must know each separate sub -program and their supervisor must also be able to guide the employee or answer questions they may have as to how to apply the criteria etc. In addition, the central office staff for each program must keep up with ever changing federal regulations and state changes that must then be distributed out to our many f ield offices. These changes can be weekly or even daily sometimes meaning employees and managers need to keep up with a myriad of process or policy changes every day. This justifies a higher ratio than 1:11. 7/26/2022 07/26/2022 7/27/2022 2023-25 Ways and Means Page|6 Oregon Department of Human Services Max Supervisory Report "}
