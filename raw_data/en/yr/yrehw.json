Here are the best toddler balance bike options in a variety of materials and price-points. Toddler Balance Bikes Balance bikes are, quite simply, small bikes that don't have pedals. Kids as young as two\u2014or even younger, if you opt for a [tricycle version](https://amzn.to/3nnSRts)!\u2014ride them by pushing off with their feet and then gliding (almost like a seated scooter). These are a great first-bike option because they really teach kids to balance (hence the name, of course!), as opposed to a traditional two-wheeler with training wheels that can be clunky and act as a crutch. There's little doubt that they're [becoming super popular](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/balance-bikes-overtake-training-wheels-teaching-young-riders-n436971), since there are now tons (and tons!) of options to choose from. My middle kiddo started using a balance bike when she was two and was riding a regular two wheeler before she turned four. It was clear that the skills she learned using the balance bike helped her take off on the regular one as soon as she was big enough! This is hands-down, one of our favorite [toddler activities](https://www.yummytoddlerfood.com/free-activities-for-kids/). We've gone through all the many choices for you and narrowed it down to these best picks across a range of the post trusted brands. Frequently Asked Questions Yes, balance bikes are a safe bike option if they are the appropriate size for the height of the child, used with a helmet, and used with parental supervision. The Kinderfeets balance bike and the [Woom balance bike](https://us.woombikes.com/pages/originals) can be used at about a year and a half as a baby balance bike. It will depend on the height of the child and the height of the balance bike. A balance bike can help a toddler learn how to balance on a bike, which can help them skip the need for training wheels and go straight to riding a bike with pedals. It can also be a safe way for them to ride a bike on their own from an early age. No, it can be a great age since they are likely still too small for a regular bike and it can help them practice their balance to make the eventual transition to a regular bike smooth and easy. Best Starter Toddler Balance Bike: [Kinderfeets Tiny Tot 2-in-1 Bike](https://amzn.to/3jx5qA4) There's really a lot to love here! First of all, this gorgeous bike is made from sturdy birchwood and features eco-friendly handlebar grips and non-toxic paint. Plus\u2014and this is a big plus if you have a one year old who loves bikes\u2014it's a 2-in-1 version. This means that it starts out as a tricycle balance bike for ages 12 months and up and then can be converted to a two-wheeler once your child is ready. Oh, and the price? It's under $80. Which is pretty reasonable for a large wooden toy that lasts for years! (Pictured at top of the post.) Best Strider Bike: [Strider 12-inch Classic Balance Bike](https://amzn.to/2Stj8rR) Strider is probably the best known balance bike brand. This model, which is a perfect starter option for some kids as young as 18 months (depending on their size\u2014it was too hard for my 20 month to use when we tried it but I could see it being great in a few months!), is super light weight and has a fully adjustable seat height that makes it easy for little kids to maneuver. It's also their most affordable bike at under $90 and comes in four bright, fun colors. (They also make one that's [adjustable up to age 5](https://amzn.to/3d1UoQU).)

Budget Balance Bike for Kids Age 3-5: [Yvolution Y Velo Senior](https://amzn.to/3DHnunW) The Y Velo Senior next-step-up from this brand's popular [Y Velo Junior](https://amzn.to/2F2xlZI) bike, and the perfect step-up for a slightly older toddler or one who has already mastered a smaller balance bike.

Best Toddler Balance Bike with Fold-Out Pedals: [Little Tikes My First Balance-to-Pedal Bike](https://amzn.to/34xJ7US) This toddler bike is really the best of both worlds.
