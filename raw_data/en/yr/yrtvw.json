Prevention Activities National Capital Region Compact to Combat Opioid Addiction - The Mayor of the District of Columbia and the Governors of Maryland and Virginia have pledged to work collaboratively to help stop the damaging effects of opioid addiction on the lives of those addicted, their families, law enforcement, health care provide rs, and the broader community. Their efforts to fight this public health and public safety emergency include: 1) a regional strategy to raise awareness of opioid and substance abuse, 2) curb stigmatization of addiction through regional communication strate gies, 3) develop targeted messaging on the risks of synthetic opioid overdose and Fentanyl, and 4) convene the second Regional Summit in FY 2018. To monitor the success , the District, Maryland , and Virginia will share periodic updates about the efforts to fulfill these commitments. On behalf of the District of Columbia , DBH supported the Annual Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia Page 18 of 23 Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia - OMB 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 56 of 296Regional Summit and participate d on the Planning Committee. Through the work of this body, a strategic plan \"Live . Long. DC,1\" was developed to guide the work of t he District in addressing opioid use disorders. Prevention Centers - The DBH funds four (4) D.C. Prevention Centers (DCPCs) that are designed to strengthen the community's capacity to reduce substance use and prevent risk factors. The DCPCs are dynamic, community -based hubs that serve two (2) wards each and include: 1) Latin Am erican Youth Center (Wards 1 & 2); 2) National Capital Coalition to Prevent Underage Drinking (Wards 3 & 4); 3) Sasha Bruce Youthwork, Inc. (Wards 5 & 6); and 4) Brid ging Resources I n Communities (Wards 7 & 8). The services include community education, co mmunity leadership, and community change. Community education focuses on current, relevant drug use/access information. Community leadership builds the prevention capacity of current and emerging leaders and identifies potential community prevention netwo rks (CPNs) for data-driven planning. It also facilitates the CPNs in the 5 -step Strategic Prevention Framework action planning (assessment, capacity building, strategic planning, implementation, and evaluation). Community change involves working with the networks in action plan development and implementation. The Centers address measures for three (3) outcomes: 1) changes in priority risk and protective factors; 2) community changes (e.g. new policies, programs, and practices that address the prevention needs assessment and ac tion planning); and 3) behavioral outcomes. Combating Opioid Misuse within the HEP -C/HIV Population - DBH substance use disorder staff attended this training event in September 2016. The presentations addressed the challenges in screening, treating and managing patient populations co -infected with Hepatitis - C, HIV, mental illness and opioid misuse. Prevention Symposium - Originally implemented in October 2016, this symposium has taken place three (3) consecutive years (2016-2018). The participants included DBH substance use disorder staff, prevention center staff, and other participants. The session discussions included: 1) Under Age Drinking, 2) Use of Social Media for Prevention Messaging, and 3) Marijuana Use. This event aims to build the substance use prevention workforce within the District , and focuses on different areas of substance use prevention each year. With a desire to build upon the previous year's success, the planning committee researches national trends and suc cesses in locations comparable to the District , from which lessons learned can be adopted. D.C. Epidemiological Outcomes Workgroup (DC EOW ) - Work efforts towards DC EOW goals are sustained through local and Strategic Prevention Framework Partnership for Success funds. They include: 1) continue updating District and Ward alcohol, tobacco and other drug data that includes consumption, consequences, risk and protective factors, demographics and health disparities; 2) develop a collaborative effort to build a common, systematic methodology for conducting prevention needs assessment based upon a risk assessment system to guide prevention policy, program planning, and resource allocation; 3) utilize risk and protective factor data, incidence and prevalence data to estimate service needs, target prevention 1 https://dbh.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/dmh/publication/attachme nts/LIVE.%20LONG.%20DC - %20Washington%20DC%27s%20Opioid%20Strategic%20Plan -%20March%20Revision.pdf Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM Columbia Page 19 of 23 Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia - OMB 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 57 of 296resources, select appropriate preventive interventions, and evaluate the effects of the prevention system; and 4) develop District and Ward reports and resources for policy and program planners and community stakeholders. The emphasis on risk and protective factors increases an understanding that substance use and other aspects of behavioral health share many of the same risk and protective factors. Common risk factors predict diverse behavior problems including substance use, anxiety and depression, delinquency, violence, school dropout, and teen pregnancy. Because common risk factors predict diverse behavior problems, it is important to ensure that prevention efforts reach those young people exposed to many risk factors during their development. The DC EOW was expanded in FY 2016 in an effort to have a more robust group of stakeholders. Membership is made up of representatives from the following ag encies: 1) DC Health; 2) Department of Behavioral Health; 3) Child and Family Services Agency; 4) D.C. Metropolitan Police Department; 5) Criminal Justice Coordinating Council; 6) Alcohol Beverage Regulatory Agency; 7) Department of Consumer and Regulator y Affairs; 8) Children's National Health System; 9) D.C. Pretrial Services Agency; 10) Department of Transportation; 11) D.C. Hospital Association; 12) The Children's Trust; 13) Legacy Foundation: 14) DBH D.C. Prevention Center representative; and 15) Rese arch Triangle Institute. DBH supports the SAMHSA premise that the backbone of an effective prevention system is an infrastructure with the ability to collect and analyze epidemiological data and to use this data to identify areas of greatest need. DC EOW data sources will continue to include the D.C. Youth Risk Behavior Survey, National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and archival indicators. In the fall of 2015, DC piloted a Ward level telephone survey , and re-administered this for the next three years, to address Ward gaps in youth and adult data, especially risk and protective factors. Through the work mentioned above of the DC EOW, collected data has been housed on an on -line data dashboard where the public can view data trends and also run various types of queries for data analytical purposes. Recovery Coaching Training In FY 2016, DBH substance use disorder staff developed a 36-hour Recovery Coaching Training curriculum. The proposed certification program began in FY 2017. The training prepares persons in recovery, recovery program staff, leaders of recovery provider organizations, peer specialists, and recovery coach candidates to implement recovery coaching skills and strategies within an array of recovery support services. In April 2017, two (2) instructors conducted the Recovery Coaching Training with 18 Recovery Coaches (5 Peer Recovery Coaches and 13 Recovery Coaches). They completed the 40-hour course and received a training certificate. Th e course content included topics related to: 1) Using Strengths to Build Recovery Capital and Achieve, 2) Cultural Competence and Recovery Coaching in a Recovery Oriented System of Care, and 3) Recovery Support Services, Care Coordination and Recovery Coac hes. In Fiscal Year 2018 and 2019, two (2) instructors conducted the Recovery Coaching Training with 95 individuals. Participants completed the 30 -hour course and received a training certificate.

Adults, Young Adults and Youth Substance Use Campaigns \"The Blunt Truth \" (addresses marijuana use) 2015 - The Blunt Truth campaign focuses on educating the public about the laws governing marijuana consumption in the District of Columbia. Materials point out the \"cans\" and \"can nots,\" so that individuals can make informed decisions and stay within the realm of the law. \"Adult Synthetics \" 2016 (addresses synthetic drug use among adults) - Building upon the K2 Zombie campaign, the Adult Synthetics campaign clarifies that the purchase, s ale, and use of synthetic drugs are illegal in the District of Columbia. The campaign addres sed designer drugs such as \"Molly\" and other drugs found to be popular among adults. The associated laws were made available through brochures, palm cards, and a website to inform as many adults as possible. \"Opioid Awareness Campaign\" 2017 (addresses opioid use among adults, young adults and youth) - DBH Substance Use Disorder Services Prevention Division developed this campaign to raise awareness about the risks associated with opioid use and to direct individuals to help. Phase 1 targets adults, specifically older African American male heroin users age 40 -69. It highlights increased health risks of using heroin , especially batches laced with other synthetic opioids such as fentanyl and carfentanil. It also promotes the use of Naloxone that can reverse an overdose resulting from heroin use. The emphasis will be on seeking medical attention following administration of the Naloxone. \"More Harmful Than You Think\" 2017 - The More Harmful Than You Think campaign is an expansion of DBH's opioid a wareness campaign which primarily targets youth. In focusing on youth, the campaign highlights the misuse of prescribed opioids such as pills and cough syrup. The campaign seeks to draw a contrast between how people \"think\" they look while misusing opioids (e.g., fun -loving, the life of the party, etc.) and how they may actually look while misusing opioids (e.g., disoriented, lethargic, drugged, etc. ). Beyond its initial launch, the campaign will continue targeting youth and young adults to shed light on how the misuse of prescribed opioids can lead to addiction, be a gateway to more potent variations of opioids, or result in death. Also, a focus will r emain on addressing the notion that many individuals who are misusing prescription opioids are not knowledgeable of the risks and/or the class of drugs they are using (e.g., the same family as heroin).

Narrative Question: This step should identify the unmet service needs and critical gaps in the state's current M/SUD system as well as the data sources used to identify the needs and gaps of the required populations relevant to each block grant within the state's M/SUD system. Especially for those required populations described in this document and other populations identified by the state as a priority. This step should also address how the state plans to meet the unmet service needs and gaps. A data-driven process must support the state's priorities and goals. This could include data and information that are available through the state's unique data system (including community-level data), as well as SAMHSA's data sets including, but not limited to, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS), the National Facilities Surveys on Drug Abuse and Mental Health Services , and the Uniform Reporting System (URS). Those states that have a State Epidemiological and Outcomes Workgroup (SEOW) should describe its composition and contribution to the process for primary prevention and treatment planning. States should also continue to use the prevalence formulas for adults with SMI and children with SED, as well as the prevalence estimates, epidemiological analyses, and profiles to establish mental health treatment, substance use disorder prevention, and SUD treatment goals at the state level. In addition, states should obtain and include in their data sources information from other state agencies that provide or purchase M/SUD services. This will allow states to have a more comprehensive approach to identifying the number of individuals that are receiving services and the types of services they are receiving. In addition to in-state data, SAMHSA has identified several other data sets that are available to states through various federal agencies: CMS, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), and others. Through the Healthy People Initiative16 HHS has identified a broad set of indicators and goals to track and improve the nation's health. By using the indicators included in Healthy People, states can focus their efforts on priority issues, support consistency in measurement, and use indicators that are being tracked at a national level, enabling better comparability. States should consider this resource in their planning. 16 http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/default.aspx Page 1 of 122 Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia - OMB 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 62 of 296FFY 20 -21 MHBG and SABG Combined Application Table of Contents Page Executive Summary 44 Step 2: Population Overview 45-57 o Early Childhood and Children Unmet Service Needs or Critical Gaps o Transition Age youth and Young Adults Unmet Service Needs or Critical Gaps o Adult Unmet Service Needs or Critical Gaps o Proposed Plans to Address Needs and Gaps Statutory Reporting Criteria Narratives 57-117 o Criterion 1 o Criterion 2 o Criterion 3 o Criterion 4 o Criterion 5 Opioid STR Needs Assessment (Upload) 117-138 LIVE.

DBH serves as the State Ment al Health Authority (SMHA) and the District of Columbia Single State Agency (SSA) for substance use disorders. This application describes the strengths and organizational capacity of the District's behavioral health service system to address specific pop ulations, identifies unmet service needs and critical gaps in the current system, and outlines a plan to address these behavioral health system needs and gaps with MHBG and SABG 2020 -2021 funding. To address mental health services and system gaps, the Dis trict will extensively and strategically utilize peer support services and expand and develop children services. To target substance use prevention and treatment unmet service needs and gaps, the District will focus on 1) providing and supporting community -wide training and implementation of evidenced -based treatment models for co -occurring disorders, and 2) supporting evidence -based treatment and recovery models for youth and young adults. Service development, enhancement, expansion, coordination, and inte gration are strategic methods and approaches to ensuring timely access to mental health and substance use treatment, prevention, and recovery service for children, youth and adults. In its combined 2020 -2021 MHBG and SABG Application, the Department of Behavioral Health continues its commitment to ensuring access to high quality, accountable, a recovery -oriented behavioral health system that meets the needs of District residents. Further, the combined application advances our DBH mission: to develop, man age and oversee a public behavioral health system for adults, children and youth and their families that is consumer -driven, community -based, culturally competent and supports prevention, resiliency and recovery and the overall well -being of the District o f Columbia.

This step should identify the unmet service needs and critical gaps in the state's current M/SUD system as well as the data sources used to identify the needs and gaps of the required populations relevant to each block grant within the state's M/SUD system. Especially for those required populations described in this document and other populations identified by the state as a priority. This step should also address how the state plans to meet the unmet service needs and gaps.

DBH has a variety of services for young children that include: 1) Healthy Futures - provides mental health consultation services in Child Development Centers (CDCs) 2) Primary Project - provides early identification of student's level of social -emotional adjustment in the classroom and at CDCs , and 3) School Mental Hea lth Program - provides prevention, early intervention and treatment services to young children and children in the District of Columbia schools. Young children can receive services at all levels of the continuum. Most Important Early Childhood Unmet Servi ce Needs or Critical Gaps One of the unmet needs or critical gaps is that few individuals working with the early childhood population have received specific training in early childhood development. The D.C. Social Emotional and Early Development Project ( D.C. SEED) is designed to provide Early Childhood training to a wide range of audiences (e.g., child development staff, Access Help Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia Page 6 of 122 Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia - OMB 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 67 of 296Line staff, and clinicians) to help increase knowledge regarding children birth to age six. The developmental progress of the children will be measured by changes in knowledge. Another unmet need or critical gap is related to sufficient numbers of evidence -based treatment services for young children with mental health concerns. While DBH, specifically the Parent - Infant Early Childhood Enhancement Program and the School Mental Health Program, have been providing mental health services for young children for years; there are not enough services in District of Columbia for young children. One of the goals of D.C. SEED is to support the expansion and strengthening of mental health services for children birth to age 6 who have been diagnosed with a serious emotional disturbance or are at risk for one. D.C. SEED will train providers on three (3 ) evidence -based programs which will increase the capacity for young children and families to receive services. Progress is measured through monitoring the number of children receiving services as well as looking at improvements based on their functioning (pre/post assessments). In recent years there have been discussions on how DBH can better support both children in the District needing mental health services as well as children's mental health providers. In February 2019, the report \"Behavioral Healt h in the District of Columbia for Children, Youth & Families: Understanding the Current System,\" by the Children's Law Center, Children's National Health System, and the District of Columbia Behavioral Health Association provide d an in-depth look at the cu rrent system. Transition Age Youth and Young Adults The Department of Behavioral Health (DBH) offers a range of programs and services for children and adults but limited programs to address the needs of Transition Age Youth (TAYs) and young adults (YAs ). There needs to be a seamless provision of mental health services , and recovery supports for TAY as they enter adulthood, particularly those who are at high risk and multi-system involved. Most Important Unmet Transition Age Youth and Young Adults Servi ce Needs or Critical Gaps The current provider network is somewhat fragmented, causing a silo system of care that complicates access for individuals transitioning from adolescence to adulthood. The delivery of mental health services has been divided into two (2) systems: one serving children and one serving adults, with different eligibility requirements, health care providers, and funding streams. When a young person \"ages out\" by surpassing the DBH age-defined eligibility limit of 22, the services are discontinued and these young persons are referred to the adult mental health system. The lack of continuity of care is disruptive, as youth must adjust to a n ew culture of care, with new case managers, therapists, and treatments. Also, the services, in general, may not be age-appropriate or consistent with the kind of care or treatment plan customized for the youth up until this point. Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia Page 7 of 122 Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia - OMB 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 68 of 296Studies have found that this interruption in services, coupled with the abrupt discontinuation of regular contacts with peers in the child health system, may cause young people to adjust poorly to the new services or reject them altogether. DBH has found that t his fragmented approach has led to an abandonment of mental health treatment by many TAY who start-out in the child mental health system and upon aging leave the system entirely. DBH and its providers need to develop more training opportunities that focus on the needs of TAY and YAs. Another service need or critical gap is related to substance use disorder (SUD) treatment for TAY and YAs. The system was set up to provide SUD services to youth ages 12-20. However, the 21 and above population w as integrated with the adult SUD population. Findings show th at the young adult population w as not ready to be integrated with the adults, which caused their needs to be unmet. In response to the increasing need to expand SUD treatment and recovery services to transition-age youth, see Environmental Factors and Plan 4; Evidence-Based Practices for Early Interventions to Address Early Serious Mental Illness (ESMI)1. Adult Unmet Needs Clinical Care Coordination is a s ervice available for substance use disorder treatment , and effective July 1, 2019, DBH established a 24/7 Community Response Team (CRT), which merges four existing mental health community outreach teams (Homeless Outreach, Mobile Crisis, Pre -Arrest Diversion, and Crisis Outreach Services to expand access to care. The Community Response Team will: Provide low or no barrier assessment and referral for individuals presenting with developing or untreated mental illness and substance disorders; Engage with individuals who are connected to care, but not act ively engaged with services due to other barriers , and short term support in resolving crisis to reduce barriers and increase access to available care. CRT deployment situations include community outreach and engagement, trauma events, and crisis assessment. Care Coordination will provide referral/follow up with identified resource or agency for case planning and co nsultation for individuals who are difficult to engage vs. new enrollments; support SUD treatment assessment, referral , and support; support navigation within the criminal justice system; and facilitate Guardianship petitions. Within the SUD network, care coordination is highly under -utilized. In FY18 of 4,208 SUD clients served, only 517 (12%) received a clinical care coordination service. In FY19 YTD, of 4,999 consumers served , 1689 (34%) received a Clinical Care Coordination service. Although there h as been some improvement on the SUD side, there is still room for improvement. DBH sees this service as critical in helping to 1 https://livelong.dc.gov/page/strategic -plan -0 Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia Page 8 of 122 Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia - OMB 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 69 of 296Printed: 1/7/2019 1:12 PM - District of Columbia Page 49 of 50 ensure the consumer's full range of care needs are being addressed by both Substance Use Disorder providers and Mental Health Pr oviders. Outreach : Goals of outreach are to connect those in need to available resources in the community, including mental health treatment, substance use treatment, housi ng, benefits, and primary care; thereby increasing health, safety, and quality of life of the District of Columbia residents. In a grant -funded pilot program, Cooperative Agreements to Benefit Homeless Individuals (CABHI) teams had nearly 20,000 face to face engagements with people on the streets, seeing 325 people housed and 74 people getting social security benefits as a result of the outreach and engagement efforts. DBH plans to extend these efforts to engage people in need of necessary behavioral health services in the District. The District estimates that it will have the capacity to treat approximately 120 pregnant women and women with children in residential and 583 in outpatient services per year. It is estimated that 1,324 women will need these services. The District's system needs include services for youth in transition and residential programs for individuals under 21. Data from a Districtwide telephone survey administered between 2015 and 201 6 has assisted DBH with understanding the scope of the substance use problem among youth within the District by gathering responses related to ease of access to illicit substances, perceived risks associated with use, and the age of first use. As it perta ins to ease of access, results show that 42% of respondents felt that alcohol was fairly easy to access , and approximately half reported that marijuana was easily accessible. When considering the risks associated with use, 36% reported a great risk of smo king marijuana regularly , and 44% about having one (1) to two (2) drinks of alcohol almost daily. Last, in accounting for the age of first use, the average ages for having the first drink of alcohol and first trying marijuana was 13 years old and 13.3 years old, respectively. It is important to note that 67% of respondents reported never trying alcohol , and 78% reported never trying marijuana. The analysis of survey responses guide d DBH's substance use prevention efforts and further iterates the need to fo cus on preventing and delaying the onset of alcohol, tobacco, and other drug (ATOD) use. Additionally, student self -reported data from the 2015 District of Columbia Office of the State Superintendent of Education's (OSSE) Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) show that 28.7% and 20.1% used marijuana or had at least one drink of alcohol within the past 30 days leading up to taking the survey. While this percentage is down from what was reported during the most recent administration of the survey in 2012, the legalization of marijuana for recreational use, albeit for those 21 years of age and older, is likely to impact use among adolescents. The 2015 YRBS shows how the percentage of use for a multitude of substances (e.g., marijuana, alcohol, synthetic marijuan a, electronic vapor products, etc.) increases significantly as school performance worsens.

Peer Services The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services declared peer support an evidence -based practice in 2007. The role of peer support workers has expanded over the years from offering mutual support through self -help groups and peer -run programs (e.g. , drop-in centers) to the provision of services. Peer -delivered services generate superior outcomes in terms of e ngaging \"difficult to reach\" individuals, reducing rates of hospitalizations and days spent as an inpatient, and decreasing substance use among persons with co -occurring substance use disorder. Literature informs us that when peers interact with someone in crisis, they can connect the individual to care 40% to 65% of the time; when a professional staff person does, the connection rate drops to 25%. It is clear of the critically important role that peers play in our system. As of June 2019, DBH has 158 c ertified peers in the behavioral health system and is committed to increasing this number. One of our KPIs for FY 19 tracks the number of new Certified Peer Specialists, including those in specialty tracks of family and youth. Thirty-nine (39) states h ave Medicaid programs that cover peer support services for either individuals with mental illness, individuals with addiction disorders, or both groups. The Consumer and Family Affairs Administration has indicated that certified peer specialists are intent on becoming standalone Medicaid providers with their own National Provider Identifier (NPI), removing the requirement to work under anyone's supervision. Peers have expressed that their work is hampered by documentation requirements. DBH staff have concerns that under the current Community Support Services (CSS) model, peers are under - utilized, due to some of the perceived provider barriers regarding supervision (where that supervision is not required of other personnel providing the same type of serv ices). From the FQHC perspective, FQHCs are intent on being able to hire peers for services that fall outside CSS and Recovery Support Services. Altogether, there is a very strong interest in thinking differently about how peers participate in our overal l system of care and creating more symmetry between the SUD and MH -type peer supports. DBH staff is looking into these issues . For example, the DBH Consumer and Family Affairs Administration , working with other relevant DBH Divisions, is aiming to conduc t an environmental scan of peer support services among behavioral health providers and Certified Peer Specialist/Recovery Coaches over the coming months . Additionally, DBH will seek support from national experts on how to incorporate best practices for a robust role for peers.

The requirements include \"Earlier Identification and Engageme nt in Treatment Including Through Increased Integration \": Implementation of strategies for identifying and engaging individuals, particularly adolescents and young adults, with serious mental health conditions, in treatment sooner including through suppo rted employment and supported education programs; Increasing integration of behavioral health care in non -specialty care settings, including schools and primary care practices, to improve identification of serious mental health conditions sooner and impro ve awareness of and linkages to specialty treatment providers; and Establishment of specialized settings and services, including crisis stabilization services, focused on the needs of young people experiencing SMI or SED. Section 4.2.4 of the Mayor's r ecently released \"Resilience DC\" recommends providing a complete continuum of care for residents with severe mental health illness or substance abuse disorders. Tasks include reviewing the authorities that govern behavioral health services to identify gaps in DC's current service array; seeking to increase the number and type of mental health services billable to Medicaid, enhancing coordination, and supporting better data; and working with the Department of Healthcare Finance to establish new services and/ or enhance those services currently available. 2 SABG The District proposes the following plan to meet unmet services needs for the substance use service and system gaps : 1) Provid e and support community -wide training and implementation of evidence -based treatment models to address co -occurring disorders (substance use/mental health and behavioral health/primary care); and 2) support evidence -based treatment and recovery models for y outh and young adults. Co-occurring Treatment Models Integrated treatment \u2014treating both disorders (substance use and mental health disorders) at the same time \u2014can stabilize the symptoms of co -occurring disorders and provide the foundation for lasting recovery. As of May 2019, DBH has eight providers cert ified in both substance use disorder and mental health services (of 88 total DBH providers). To our knowledge, there are no providers that are implementing evidence -based co-occurring treatment models. DBH would like to train providers on co-occurring tr eatment models and support implementation. One model to explore is Seeking Safety, a present -focused therapy to help individuals attain safety from co -occurring PTSD , and substance use. The model has been conducted in group and individual format; for wom en, men, and mixed -gender; using all topics or fewer topics; in a variety of settings (e.g., outpatient, inpatient, residential); and for both substance use and dependence. It has also been used with individuals who have a trauma history but do not meet c riteria for PTSD. 2 https://resilient.dc.gov/ Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - of Columbia Page 13 of 122 Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia - OMB 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 74 of 296 Evidence -based Treatment and Recovery Models for Youth and Young Adults The District has a great need for adolescent/Transition Aged Youth (TAY) SUD and mental health treatment and recovery services. The Youth Behavioral Risk Surv ey (YBRS) indicates that of the 18,306 surveyed in 2017, 33% of high school students (estimated 6,040) used marijuana in the past 30 days, 21% (est. 3,752 students) used alcohol, 15% (est. 2,745) used prescription medication without having a prescription, and 4% (est. 640) used synthetic marijuana (CDC, 2018). Further, according to the 2015 and 2016 State Estimates of SAMHSA's National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), past month illicit drug, alcohol , and marijuana use among the District's 12 to 17 -year olds were higher than the U.S. rate. Past month illicit drug use for 12 to 17 -year olds and past month binge alcohol use among 12 to 20 -year olds are among the highest in the U.S (18% DC vs. 13% U.S.). While prevalence data are not readily available on the mental health conditions for the District's 12 -17-year olds, the latest estimates show that 21% of the 18 -25-year olds have experienced mental illness in the past year. DBH, DHCF, and a network of certified substance abuse treatment providers h ave worked to expand access to adolescent substance abuse and mental health treatment. Currently, Adolescents/TAY (ages 12 -21) can access services directly from the substance abuse treatment provider near their home, school, or job, and every adolescent/T AY accessing substance abuse treatment through the Adolescent Substance Abuse Treatment Expansion Program (ASTEP) is screened for indicators of a mental health disorder using the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN). However, to meet the need of th e District's youth and young adults, DBH would like to widen its portfolio of evidence -based treatment and recovery models specifically for this population. The only substance use disorder evidence -based treatment currently provided for youth is the Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach (ACRA). ACRA is a behavioral approach for youth and young adults with substance use/co -occurring disorders. ACRA promotes increasing the family, social, and educational/vocational protective factors that support recovery. The goal of ACRA is to improve life satisfaction, increase harm -reduction knowledge, and promote abstinence from drugs and alcohol. Through the DC City Grant, school -based counselors will be trained on Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET)/Cog nitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and continue the ACRA work. Some counselors were trained in December 2018 and January 2019 on MET/CBT. To widen its portfolio, DBH would like to include practices such as The Seven Challenges program, which starts where yo uth \"are at\" (usually resistant and reluctant to change), not where adults wish they might be or where young people often pretend to be (ready, willing, and prepared to succeed with immediate abstinence). Research and studies demonstrate the effectiveness of The Seven Challenges as a \"co -occurring\" program that significantly decreases the substance use of adolescents and dramatically improves their overall mental health status. Data also show that the program has been especially effective with a large num ber of substance - Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia Page 14 of 122 Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia - OMB 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 75 of 296abusing youth who have trauma issues. Additionally, DBH would like to add The Integrated Co - Occurring Treatment Model (ICT), which is an integrated treatment approach embedded in an intensive home -based method of service delivery that pro vides a core set of services to youth with co-occurring disorders of substance use and serious emotional disability and provides services to the families caring for them. Models of treatment, such as those described would allow DBH to address the specific needs of youth and young adults and assist providers with reaching and treating both substance use and mental health disorders for this population in an effective way. While DBH is taking essential steps to reach youth and young adults, providers need the evidence-based resources to be able to offer effective treatment that will aid in the long -term recovery of both substance use and mental health. Continuous Quality Improvement DBH is a data-driven agency and has adopted a focus of continuous qu ality improvement. The Department recognizes that it must c reate a structured process for identifying gaps, analyzing, and improving service delivery. Quality improvement and data collection are located within two administration: Systems Transformation Administr ation and Accountability Administr ation. Systems Transformation Administration The Systems Transformation Administration (STA) coordinates DBH's strategy development and performance improvement processes to help advance our mission: to develop, manage and oversee a public behavioral health system for adults, children and youth, and their families that is consumer -driven, community based, culturally competent and supports prevention, resiliency, and recovery and the overall well -being of the District of Col umbia. This work involves building consensus among diverse stakeholders, implementing strategic priorities, and mobilizing the behavioral health system to take action. The Administration includes a Data and Performance Management Division that meets the agency's data reporting and analysis needs by working with staff throughout the Department to identify what information is needed, creates reports and dashboards that presents and makes the information accessible, and helps staff understand what the information means and how it can be used to improve performance. The Division also c oordinate s DBH's annual Performance Accountability Report (PAR), which includes DBH accomplishments, reports, and measures. Led by the Data and Performance Management Division, DBH is partnering with a nationally - recognized vendor (NRI) to develop a performance management framework to help establish benchmarks for high -quality performance, including one set of priority metrics covering system - level outcomes and processe s. In addition to recommending priority metrics, NRI will make recommendations for a continuous quality improvement (CQI) process by which performance will be monitored , and technical assistance will be provided to providers. DBH is seeking to enhance an d consolidate its historical and emerging provider measurement systems into one comprehensive and efficient CQI framework. The District Automated Treatment and Accounting (DATA) system is the current electronic health record for SUD reporting. The Department has the current capability to generate extensive custom data reports using SSRS (a SQL Server statistics program fully incorporated into DATA), which allows information to be extracted at the client, program, and provider level.

SSRS is sufficient for the majority of our SUD data needs. There are more sophisticated reports that are beyond the capacity of SSRS to complete, and these reports are purchased from FEI (the developer of the DATA System). Additionally, the newly implemented SQL data warehouse, which is the repository for a SUD and Mental Health data, as well as Medicaid and other claims-based data, allows for DBH to track client-level data between both systems. DBH is currently able to collect and report on client-level data. DBH uses the SUD TEDS and NOMS format for federal reporting. STA shares data with providers monthly and provides technical assistance to improve data quality. In FY20, the focus will shift to monitoring outcomes on priority population metrics, such as transitions between levels of care and client retention. Accountability Administration The Accountability Administration oversees provider certification; mental health community- residence facility licensure; program integrity; quality improvement; incident management; major investigations; claims audits; and compliance monitoring. Primary Prevention Data Collection The District will continue to collect provider level primary prevention data. This data will be collected through the Data Infrastructure Reporting System (DIRS) every month. DIRS is an electronic reporting system that is used to collect, analyze, and evaluate prevention efforts taking place throughout the District. Providers (sub-grantees) submit data on the number of new activities; individuals reached through planned prevention activities, the number of new Community Prevention Networks (CPNs) developed, and the number of community action plans developed and implemented. Criterion 1: Comprehensive Community -Based Mental Health Service Systems The Mental Health Block Grant statutory reporting requirement Criterion 1 addresses Comprehensive Community -Based Mental Health Service Systems defined as: provides for the establishment and implementation of an organized community -based system of care for individuals with mental illness, including those with co -occurring mental health/su bstance use disorders (M/SUD). States must have available services and resources within a comprehensive system of care, provided with federal, state, and other public and private resources, in order to enable such individuals to function outside of inpatie nt or residential institutions to the maximum extent of their capabilities.

This event , which is ai med at building up the substance use prevention workforce within the District, focuses on different areas of substance use prevention each year. With a desire to build upon the previous year's success, the planning committee researches national trends and successes in locations comparable to the District from which lessons learned can be adopted. D.C. Epidemiological Outcomes Workgroup (DC EOW) - The DC EOW goals will be sustained through local and Strategic Prevention Framework Partnership for Success f unds. Workgroup goals include: 1) continue updating District and Ward alcohol, tobacco and other drug data that includes consumption, consequences, risk and protective factors, demographics and health disparities; 2) develop a collaborative effort to build a common, systematic methodology for conducting prevention needs assessment based upon a risk assessment system to guide prevention policy, program planning, and resource allocation; 3) utilize risk and protective factor data, incidence and prevalenc e data to estimate service needs, target prevention resources, select appropriate preventive interventions, and evaluate the effects of the prevention system; and 4) develop District , and Ward reports , and resources for policy and program planners and community stakeholders. The emphasis on risk and protective factors increases an understanding that substance use and other aspects of behavioral health share many of the same risk , and protective factors. Common risk factors predict diverse behavior problems including , substance use, anxiety and depression, delinquency, violence, school dropout, and teen pregnancy. Because common risk factors predict diverse behavior problems, it is important to ensure that prevention efforts reach those young people exposed t o many risk factors during their development.

Materials point out the \"cans\" and \"can nots,\" so that individuals can make informed decisions and stay within the realm of the law. \"Adult Synthetics \" 2016 (addresses synthetic drug use among adults) - Building upon the K2 Zombie campaign, the Adult Synthetics campaign clarifies that the purchase, sale, and use of synthetic drugs are illegal in the District of Columbia. The campaign addressed designer drugs such as \"Molly\" and other drugs found to be popular among adults. The associated laws were made available through brochures, palm cards, and a website to inform as many adults as possible. \"Opioid Awareness Campaign\" 2017 (addresses opioid use among adults, young adults and youth) - DBH Substance Use Disorder Services Prevention Division developed this campaign to raise awareness about the risks associated with opioid use and to direct individuals to help. Phase 1 targets adults, specifically older African American male heroin users age 40 -69. It highlights increased health risks of using heroin , especially batches laced with other synthetic opioids such as fentanyl and carfentanil. It a lso promotes the use of Naloxone that can reverse an overdose resulting from heroin use. The emphasis will be on seeking medical attention following administration of the Naloxone. \"More Harmful Than You Think\" 2017 - The More Harmful Than You Think campaign is an expansion of DBH's opioid awareness campaign which primarily targets youth. In focusing on youth, the campaign highlights the misuse of prescribed opioids such as pills and cough syrup. The campaign seeks to draw a contrast between how people \"t hink\" they look while misusing opioids (e.g., fun -loving, the life of the party, etc.) and how they may actually look while misusing opioids (e.g., disoriented, lethargic, drugged, etc.). Beyond its initial launch, the campaign will continue targeting youth and young adults to shed light on how the misuse of prescribed opioids can lead to addiction, be a gateway to more potent variations of opioids, or result in death. Also, a focus will remain on addressing the notion that many individuals who are mis using prescription opioids are not knowledgeable of the risks and/or the class of drugs they are using (e.g., the same family as heroin). District of Columbia Olmstead Plan 2017 -2020 Since 2007, the District's Office of Disability Rights (ODR) has had t he responsibility of Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia Page 27 of 122 Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia - OMB 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 88 of 296developing and submitting the city's Olmstead Compliance Plan to the Mayor for approval. In August 2015, Mayor Muriel Bowser created an Olmstead Working Group charged with making recommendations for revisions to future iterations of t he District's Olmstead Plan to support this effort, and to include a broad array of voices in the process. In 2016, during its first full year of existence, the Olmstead Working Group focused its efforts on determining what data the District should track to allow for a comprehensive picture of what transition looks like for individuals leaving institutionalized care and attempting to access long -term services and supports in the District. The Group concentrated its efforts and discussion around data collec tion that would aid the District in its effort to create a seamless system across agencies that tracks a person's progress toward independence in a meaningful, understandable way. Improving Long -Term Care in the District - The District is engaged in a multi-year effort to design and implement a seamless process for accessing Long Term Services and Support s (LTSS). The system embraces the principles of No Wrong Door and will ensure that individuals receive accurate information regardless of where they enter the system. Efforts are underway to streamline and si mplify the eligibility process. These system improvements wi ll reduce fragmentation , and the time it takes to connect to needed services. The Olmstead Plan details remaining system challenges and lays -out specific action steps in nine (9) strategic areas. That work will take place within the context of several on-going District - level initiatives aimed at systems improvement. These include Age-Friendly DC; DHCF's system reform efforts; Employment First State Leadership Mentoring; National Core Indicators work; and DC's No Wrong Door Initiative. Also, a strong adv ocacy community lends its support and oversight, led by groups such as the DC Developmental Disabilities Council (DDC), Project ACTION!, t he DC State Rehabilitation Council (DC SRC), and the DC Statewide Independent Living Council (SILC). The 2017 Olmstea d Plan- The Olmstead Working Group created a multi -year Plan based on the same nine priority areas that w ere the focus of the 2016 Plan: 1) A Person -Centered Culture; 2) Community Engagement, Outreach and Training; 3) Employment; 4) Housing; 5) Intake, Enrollment and Discharge Processes; 6) Medicaid Waiver Management and Systems issues; 7) Quality of Institutional and Community -Based Services, Providers and Workforce; 8) Supporting Children and Youth , and 9) Wellness and Quality of Life. Each action ste p in each priority area has a measurable, trackable, and meaningful goal that will lead the District into 2020 with a cross -agency system that is more relatable, comprehensive, and based more on an individual's preferences and concrete goals while in trans ition. Government Agencies - The primary District agencies that collaborate to implement the Olmstead Plan are described below. Department of Behavioral Health (DBH) - The DBH provides prevention, screening and assessment, intervention, and treatment and recovery services and supports for children, youth, and adults with mental health and/or substance use disorders.

In this role, Health Regulation and Licensing Administration (HRLA) staff inspect health care facilities and providers who participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, certified per District and federal laws, respond to consumer and self-reported facility incidents and complaints, and conduct inves tigations, if indicated. When necessary, HRLA takes enforcement actions to compel facilities, providers and suppliers to come into compliance with District and Federal law. Department of Health Care Finance (DHCF) - The DHCF is the District's Medicaid agency and the primary payer for all long term services and supports (LTSS) the city provides. Medicaid funds pay for care in institutional settings including nursing facilities and Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (ICF/IDDs), as well as a variety of home and community -based services (HCBS). Department of Human Services (DHS) - The DHS routinely serves people with disabilities. For example, in FY 2017 approx imately 46% of applicants were assessed as likely to have a chronic substance use disorder or severe mental illness of some magnitude, and 8% to have a learning disability in income -based programs such as TANF, SNAP, and Medicaid. In the homeless services program, 55% of singles and 26% of adult -head of families entering shelters were assessed to have a disability in at least one of eight (8) categories. In the Adult Protective Services program (that investigates reports of abuse, neglect, exploitation and self-neglect and provides temporary services and supports), an estimated 47% of those served were assessed to have a disability. D.C. Office on Aging (DCOA) - The DCOA manages the Aging and Disability Resource Center (ADRC) and funds the Senior Service Network, which together consist of more than 20 community -based organizations, operating 37 programs for District residents age 60 and older, people with disabilities (age 18-59), and their caregivers.

In FY' 2015 (the most recent data available) , the ADRC served 11,290 people, 9.38% of whom were 18 -59 living with a disability. The remaining individuals served by ADRC are people age 60 and older who may also have a disability. Department on Disability Services (DDS) - The DDS oversees and coordinates services for District residents with disabilities through a network of community -based, service providers. Within DDS, the Developmental Disabilities Administration (DDA) coordinates person -centered home and community serv ices so each person can live and work in the neighborhood of his or her choice.

ODR's current initiatives include efforts to increase access to District -owned and leased facilities, worksites and community spaces; leading monthly disability -wellness seminars and managing the District's Mentoring Program for students with disabilities. Office of the State Superintendent for Education (OSSE) - The OSSE is the District's state education agency. OSSE is responsible for ensuring that all education -related public agencies identify and evaluate children who may have a disability and provide an education that meets the children's individualized needs alongside peers without disabilities to the maximum extent appropriate. OSSE also has oversight of non -public special education schools -- the most restrictive educational placements for children with disabilities. In FY 2015 (the most recent data available) , 12,173 children with qualifying disabilities ages 3 - 21 were served. In addition, OSSE oversaw IDEA Pa rt C early intervention services for approximately 700 infants and toddlers. Finally, OSSE operated hundreds of buses that traveled 34,000 miles per day to transport more than 3,000 students with disabilities to their schools across the region. Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services - The Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services (DYRS) is responsible for the supervision, custody, and care of young people charged with a delinquent act in the District in one of the following circumstances: Detained i n a DYRS facility while awaiting adjudication. Committed to DYRS by a DC Family Court judge following adjudication. Youth can be initially committed to the agency until the age of 18 and may remain in DYRS' care until the age of 21. The agency provides co mprehensive support services to committed youth, both in its secure facilities and within the community, and is designed to help young people get on the right track and successfully transition into adulthood. Department of Child and Family Services Agency - The DC Child and Family Services Agency (CFSA) is the public child welfare agency in the District of Columbia responsible for protecting child victims and those at risk of abuse and neglect and assisting their families. CFSA has four primary fun ctions: 1. Take and Investigate Reports: CFSA Child Protective Services (CPS) takes reports of known or suspected child abuse and neglect of youngsters up to age 18 in the District 24 hours a day at 202 -671-SAFE. When a report indicates a child may have suff ered abuse or neglect as defined in law, CPS must investigate to determine whether the report is true or false. Investigative social workers look into reports of child abuse and Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia Page 30 of 122 Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia - OMB 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 91 of 296neglect by parents, guardians, or others acting in a parental capacity whereve r they occur in the District. 2. Assist Families: In child welfare, serving primary clients \u2014children\u2014means helping their parents or caretakers. When CFSA identifies child victims of abuse or neglected, trained social workers from CFSA and private organization s under contract to CFSA step in to keep children safe while working with their families. Social workers connect families to services that can help them overcome long -standing difficulties that endanger their children. 3. Provide Safe Out -of-Home Care: When a home presents too much danger, CFSA temporarily removes children to safe settings \u2014and promptly seeks agreement with the removal from Family Court. Relatives take some children. CFSA also recruits, trains, and licenses foster parents and also licenses, mon itors, and maintains contracts with group homes and other safe places for children and youth. 4. Re-establish Permanent Homes: Young people grow up best in a family. CFSA works to ensure every child and youth leaves the system to return safely to parents, to go to a permanent home with relatives or others through guardianship, or to join a new forever family through adoption.

Targeted Services to Rural Populations The District of Columbia is an urb an area. Targeted Services to Homeless Populations Like all major cities in America, the District of Columbia faces a severe shortage of affordable housing, particularly for individuals at 0 -30% of Area Median Income (AMI). To address this challenge, the District is investing millions of dollars each year in the creation of new affordable and supportive housing , and is also in the midst of a total transformation of its housing crisis response system. DC Interagency Council on Homelessness & the Homeward DC Plan The District of Columbia Interagency Council on Homelessness (ICH) is a group of cabinet -level leaders, providers of homeless services, business , private sector representatives, advocates, and persons with lived experience that come together to inform and guide the District's strategies and policies for meeting the needs of individuals and families who are homeless or at imminent risk of becoming h omeless. The ICH serves as the District's Continuum of Care Governance Board (CoC) under the federal Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing (HEARTH) Act. In 2015, the ICH developed and released a comprehensive strategic plan, Homeward DC, to guide the District's efforts at transforming its homeless services system into an effective crisis response system with the ultimate goal of ensuring homelessness in the District is a rare, brief, and nonrecurring experience. The data-driven plan identifies over 40 strategies across five broad objectives: 1) d evelop a more effective crisis response system; 2) increase the supply of affordable and supportive housing; 3) remove barriers to affordable and supportive housing; 4) increase the economic security of households in the system; and 5) increase prevention efforts to stabilize households before housing loss occurs. The District is currently in the middle of its 4th year of plan implementation. Since FY16, which marked the first official invest ments in the plan, family homelessness has decreased a remarkable 45.3 percent. However, during this same period, homelessness among unaccompanied adults increased by 5.2 percent - a reflection of the tremendous inflow of individuals , newly experiencing ho melessness each year. Behavioral health issues remain a significant challenge among this population. The sections that follow provide more detail on the services available to and the characteristics of persons experiencing homelessness in the District. Description of Targeted Services Available to Persons Experiencing Homelessness The District makes the following services available for residents facing housing crises: year - Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia Page 62 of 122 Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia - OMB 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 123 of 296round emergency shelter, meal services, daytime services, street outreach, emergen cy rental assistance, targeted prevention assistance, transitional housing, rapid rehousing, targeted affordable housing,4 and permanent supportive housing. These services are available for unaccompanied adults, persons in families, unaccompanied youth, an d pregnant and parenting youth. The CoC also targets many of its services to specific subpopulations such as veterans, the LGBTQ population, and survivors of domestic violence to meet their unique service needs better. Families in the District seeking ho meless services may visit the Department of Human Services' (DHS) Virginia Williams Family Resource Center for referral to preventative and emergency resources based on need. If families have a safe place to stay for even one night, they will be referred to a homelessness prevention provider to preserve the housing and prevent a shelter stay. When prevention is not an option, families will be placed immediately into shelter. All families placed in shelter have access to rapid rehousing assistance, while a s maller subset is matched to longer-term interventions via the District's Coordinated Assessment and Housing Placement (CAHP) system.5 Unaccompanied adults experiencing homelessness may access any of the District's low barrier emergency shelters for overn ight accommodations, meals, and connection to longer -term support. Permanent housing resources, such as rapid rehousing assistance and permanent supportive housing, are allocated according to the community's prioritization protocols via the District's Coor dinated Assessment and Housing Placement (CAHP) system. In 2018, the District expanded staffing at its low barrier shelters, bringing on more than 20 additional case managers to help reduce case management ratios and speed up system exits among those who h ave been in shelter the longest. To further enhance service connectivity, particularly for unsheltered adults, the District opened a Downtown Day Services Center in partnership with the Downtown DC Business Improvement District and Pathways to Housing DC. The Center offers a variety of supportive services, including work supports from the District Department of Employment Services, assistance obtaining identification via the District Department of Health and the District Department of Motor Vehicles, benef its assistance from the Department of Human Services, and medical services from Unity Health Care. The Center also provides meals and access to laundry and shower facilities, building on the services offered at the Adams Place Day Center, which opened in 2016. 2019 Shelter and Housing Inventory The following table shows the number of units for unaccompanied individuals and families in the District's CoC. This inventory includes all programs dedicated to serving households who currently are experiencing or who have experienced homelessness. The majority of the District's 4 Targeted affordable housing is a permanent subsidy earmarked for use by the homeless services system that provides with light -touch services, targeted to those living with a disabling condition, who do not require the level of services associate d with permanent supportive housing. 5 CAHP provides standardized access and coordinated referrals to the housing placement process that ensures that persons experiencing homelessness receive appropriate assistance with both immediate and long -term housi ng and service needs.

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 2019 SHELTER & HOUSING INVENTORY Units for Individuals Units for Families Winter Shelter 839 - Emergency Shelter 2,384 667 Transitional Housing 900 225 Rapid Rehousing 365 1,893 Permanent Supportive Housing 3,729 1,274 Other Permanent Housing 1,779 976 The District of Columbia is one of just a few jurisdictions nationally and the only jurisdiction in the Washington region that provides a legal right to shelter to any resident who needs it. Accordingly, the District typically adds over 800 beds for unaccompanied individuals to its shelter capacity during the hypothermia season, which runs from November through March, when demand for shelter increases.6 While the District does not have a set number of winter shelter units for families, the emergency shelter capacity for families expands throughout the year to meet the needs of households with children as well as women who are pregnant. Dedicated housing resources - especially Rapid Re -Housing and Permanent Supportive Housing - continue to be added each year under the Homeward DC plan with the goal of scaling those programs to fully meet the need of the community. While hundreds of units have been added in recent years, hundreds more will be needed in the years ahead. 2019 Point in Time (PIT) Count Results The number of persons who are experiencing homelessness in the District of Columbia on the night of PIT - those who were sleeping on the streets, in eme rgency shelters, or in transitional housing facilities - decreased by 5.5 percent from the 2018 count and is down by 11.9 percent from the PIT count conducted five years ago. However, the results of the 2019 count vary by population. Although the number of persons in families experiencing homelessness decreased by 15.6 percent from last year, the number of unaccompanied individuals increased by 2.8 percent. This mirrors the 2018 PIT results when the CoC saw a decrease among families but a slight increase in unaccompanied adults. 6 Defined in the Homeless Services Reform Act (HSRA). Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia Page 64 of 122 Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia - OMB 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 125 of 296 POINT IN TIME COUNT BY CATEGORY, 2015 - 2019 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 % Change 2018- 2019 % -5.5% -11.9% Families Nearly 700 families exited the emergency shelter system for permanent destinations between PIT 2018 and PIT 2019. Further, the District's Homelessness Prevention Program (HPP) has been a key resource in the District's work to end homelessness among familie s. Since the program launched, DHS staff and a network of providers have helped an average of nearly 1,100 families per year maintain their housing and avoid a shelter stay. DHS is also piloting a flexible rent subsidy program to support low -income househo lds that are earning income but have trouble making ends meet. Increased prevention resources, along with a reformed shelter system and scaled housing resources to help families exit shelter, have each been instrumental in the success the CoC has seen with in the family subsystem. This multifaceted approach highlights the importance of comprehensive system reform with various interventions working together simultaneously. Unaccompanied Individuals The CoC sees an average of 150 unaccompanied individuals experiencing homelessness exit homelessness for housing resources each month, yet the District's count of single men and women experiencing homelessness increased by 2.8 percent from 2018 and is up 1.4 percent from the count conducted five years ago. The C AHP system matches individuals to rapid rehousing, targeted affordable housing, and permanent supportive housing based on their service needs, and the CoC's HMIS data shows strong housing retention rates among individuals - 85 percent for time -limited subs idy recipients and 94 percent for permanent subsidy recipients. While the CoC expected that this level of housing performance would result in the same kind of success seen among families, a persistent inflow of individuals , newly experiencing homelessness , continues to challenge the system. The District has seen the number of individuals who are newly experiencing homelessness in a given year increase from 5,588 in fiscal year 2015 to 6,933 in fiscal year 2018 - a nearly 25% increase. To address this inflow challenge, the District recently launched a shelter diversion program for single adults and continues to look at ways to improve coordination with feeder systems, including the justice system, the child welfare system, and the behavioral health system. Characteristics and Service Needs Surveys are conducted during the PIT count to gather additional information on demographic characteristics, service needs, barriers to housing, and economic indicators of persons Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia Page 65 of 122 Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia - OMB 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 126 of 296experiencing homelessness. The following tables detail the rates at which persons reported living with various disabling conditions or their affiliation with various subpopulation categories. The CoC uses this information to develop programming that addresses the disability - or subpopulation spec ific- related service needs seen among the persons counted at PIT. REPORTED DISABLING CONDITIONS AMONG PERSONS EXPERI ENCING HOMELESSNESS Single Adults: 2019 Single Adults: 2018 Adults in Families: 2019 Adults in Families:20 18 TOTAL (All Adults)20 19 TOTAL (All Adults) 2018 Substance Abuse (SA) History 21.9% 30.4% 3.3% 1.7% The characteristics and service needs reported during PIT are typically consistent from year to year, with disabling conditions and subpopulation affiliation being more prevalent (in most categories) among unaccompanied adults as opposed to adults in famil ies. While this was still true in 2019, the rates at which adults in families reported disabling conditions was higher than what the CoC saw from the family subsystem in 2018, and rates reported among individuals in 2019 were lower than were seen among ind ividuals counted in 2018. Likewise, the rates at which unaccompanied individuals and adults in families report affiliation with various subpopulations ha ve historically differed between the two subsystem groups. Though this was true again in most of the 2019 results (e.g. , veteran status, formerly resided in institutional settings), some categories show the affiliation rates becoming more similar between the two groups (formerly in foster care, speaks a language other than English). 7 Dual Diagnosis is a subset of both Chronic Substance Abuse (CSA) and Severe Mental Illness (SMI) categories. Persons counted in the Dual Diagnosis category are counted in both the CSA and SMI categories in these tables.

Department of Behavioral Health (DBH) received a SAMHSA CABHI grant that began on October 2, 2015. The focus is to help people with behavioral health conditions to find housing and supportive services. CABHI's primary goal is to ensure that the most vulnerable people experiencing homelessness and chronic homelessness receive access to housing, treatment, and recovery support services. Th e population includes veterans, sin gles, and youth. The other goals include: 1) enhance the infrastructure for coordinating, developing, planning, supporting and providing effective treatment and recovery support services; 2) expand and enhance treatment and recovery support services; and 3 ) prepare for program sustainability through evaluation, planning and ensuring the most effective use of resources. The D.C. CABHI began enrolling clients in June 2016, and most evaluation activity has been related to process measures. Evidence shows that D.C. CABHI is proceeding and working to make its monthly targets. During Year 1, the evaluation team developed a monthly tracker that allows providers to report on a variety of measures such as the number of new clients enrolled in CABHI, the cumulative n umber of clients in CABHI, the number of service referrals, the number of clients housed, the number of provider outreach engagements, Medicaid enrollees, staffing, and client demographics. Data from the monthly tracker is being used to ensure that the CAB HI grant: 1) is being implemented as intended; 2) services are being provided; 3) identifies who provides the services; 4) the service costs and related context; 5) changes in the project plans as deemed appropriate by the data; and 6) determine the degree to which the program achieved its objectives to include increasing service capacity and positively impacting health disparities. The tracker also serves as a performance monitoring and management tool. The CABHI grant closed out in April 2019. DBH is planning on implementing a new Outreach/Engagement team to help sustain and expand the CABHI initiatives.

DBH administers the District's PATH Grant. Service Area : The PATH Grant funds are used to support two (2) DBH programs: 1) Homeless Outreach Program (now under newly implemented under the Community Response Team (CRT) , and 2) Housing Subsidy Program (HSP). These programs serve homeless individuals throughout the District. PATH Funds Supported Services: The HOP conducts outreach and case finding for consumers who reside in locations unfit for human habitation (e.g., streets, abandoned vehicles, buildings); low barrier shelters; transitional programs; and other temporary residences. The HOP services inclu de: crisis services, case management, transportation, and linkage services for persons with long -term mental health and substance use disorders. The HSP provides assistance for housing homeless consumers. This has historically included providing individua ls who are homeless with first month rent and/or security deposits. Persons Served: The HOP links veterans to the Veterans Administration (VA) Medical Center, Veterans Administration Supportive Housing (VASH) program, and the VA Community Resource and Ref erral Center (CRRC). The CRRC works with homeless and at -risk veterans. Those veterans who cannot or will not be linked to the CRRC receive the full complement of HOP services. Recovery Supports: DBH continues its commitment to the \"No Wrong Door\" approac h to services, whereby consumers with co -occurring disorders can receive treatment for all of their needs, regardless of where they enter the DBH system of care. Also, HOP staff makes referrals and transports homeless individuals to the DBH Assessment and Recovery Center (ARC) for substance use treatment services. SSI/SSDI Outreach, Access, and Recovery (SOAR): This is a national program designed to increase access to the disability income benefit programs administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA) for eligible adults who are experiencing or at risk of homelessness and have a mental illness, medical impairment, and/or a co -occurring substance use disorder. As part of the new employee orientation and training, staff are enrolled in the SOAR tra ining. All members of the HOP have been trained in SOAR. HOP staff attempt to assess each consumer's benefits needs ; however consumer engagement and openness about their benefit is difficult. Consumers who are eligible and amenable to seeking benefits are targeted for quick assessment and enrolled in eligible programs. Vulnerability Index - Service Prioritization Decision and Assessment Tool (VI -SPDAT): In 2015, HOP, along with several providers in the Continuum of Care , participated in the development of the VI-SPDAT. This tool works as a coordinated entry system used by stakeholders to identify and register homeless people in the District. In 2016 and 2017 , there was continued sharing of available resources for housing, collaboration on locating individual s, and referral to appropriate levels of mental health care, health care, and substance use treatment. There was also an effort to identify subpopulations for specialized housing such as homeless veterans, LGBT adults, emancipated minors, and persons livin g with AIDS.

The use of the VI -SPDAT assessment tool has provided an expedient process to transition individuals from homelessness into housing. Targeted Services to Older Adults District of Columbia Office on Aging (DCOA): The DCOA mission is to advocate, plan, implement, and monitor programs in health, education, employment, and social services that promote longevity, independence, dignity, and choice for older District residents (age 60 and older), people with disabilities (ages 18 -59), and their caregivers. District of Columbia State Plan on Aging FY 2017 -2018: The State Plan is the blueprint for coordinating and delivering services and supports provided through DCOA. It describes th e roles< and responsibilities, challenges and focus areas. It also describes ways to improve and expand quality health and social support services to older District residents. Issues and Challenges: These include: 1) abuse, neglect and financial exploitation; 2) aging in place; 3) Alzheimer's disease and related dementia; 4) caregiver support; 5) falls prevention; 6) housing; 7) hunger; 8) social isolation and underserved populations; and 9) transportation. Services and Supports: DCOA administers the Older Americans Act (OAA) core services (supportive services, nutrition, health promotion, caregiver support, and elder rights) through the Senior Service Network (SSN), comprised of 20 community -based non -profit and private organizati ons that operate 37 programs. The services and supports are organized into three (3) categories: 1) Customer Information, Assistance and Outreach, 2) Home and Community -Based Supports, and 3) Nutrition Services. Needs Assessment and Feasibility Study: In FY 2016, DCOA commissioned a study to help identify older adult needs in the District and how they can be addressed. The final report will analyze the District's demographic trends, program services and supports, facility capabilities and opportunities, an d national best practices. The needs assessment will help identify service gaps and community demands that will inform the agency's future service provision. Age-Friendly DC Initiative : This initiative is part of an international effort launched by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2007 and addresses two (2) significant demographic trends: 1) urbanization and 2) population aging. WHO identified 8 aspects of urban communities that influence the health and quality -of-life of the older people living ther e: 1) outdoor spaces and buildings, 2) transportation, 3) housing, 4) social participation, 5) respect and social inclusion, 6) civic participation and employment, 7) communication and information, and 8) community support and health services. The District added 9) emergency preparedness and resilience and 10) elder abuse, neglect , and fraud. The District also developed an Age-Friendly DC Strategic Plan 2014 -2017.

Age-Friendly DC relies on a Mayoral-appointed Task Force for advice and guidance. The Task Force is composed of community leaders, deputy mayors, and agency directors, appointed by the Mayor, and each assigned to pay particular attention to one (1) of the 10 Age -Friendly DC domains. As a member of this group, DBH participants focus on issues related to: 1) introduc ing or expand ing primary mental health screening programs for older adults, 2) providing training on behavioral health for counselors and aides working in hospitals and home-based care units, and 3) expand ing the number of peer counseling and support programs and increase the number of older adult peer counselors. Interagency Partnerships: DBH has developed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with District agencies including t he D.C. Office on Aging (DCOA) and the Department of Health Care Finance (DHCF) to move individuals, most of whom are elderly, out of nursing homes and community hospitals into the community. DBH's role is to ensure that individuals enrolled in the mental health system receive appropriate transitional and ongoing services and supports that assist them to function effectively in the community. DBH mental health providers are responsible for coordinating all available community services and managing the del ivery of care to individuals assigned to their agency. Pre-Admission Screening/Resident Review (PASSR): As the public mental health authority, DBH is responsible for the PASRR Level II, which is required for any individual with mental illness entering o r being discharged from a nursing facility or who is in a nursing facility and has a change in condition in either their mental health or functional abilities. Criterion 5: Management Systems Financial Resources The District of Columbia FY 2018 proposed budget is $271,104,891. The Congressional approval of the District's budget is pending.

The purpose of the training is to help trainees: 1) understand the role of disaster behavioral health; 2) understand the structures in place for small scale and large scale events in the District of Columbia; 3) approaches to empower resilience and 4) lear n psychological first aid. Trainees then create a volunteer team of trained mental health professionals and laypeople available to provide services to the District in the event of a disaster that exceeds current staff capacity. During FY 2018 (October 2017 to September 2018), DBH Disaster Services conducted one training for new disaster responder cadre members (13). During FY 2018, disaster services also participated in 2018 Healthcare Emergency Preparedness Summit providing Disaster Behavioral Health tra ining to medical leaders from the Washington DC community (35 approx.).

The city is divided into four heterogeneous quadrants and 8 Wards, of unequal size and population. As of 2016, the District was 47.7% African American Alone, 45.6% White Alone , 10.9% Hispanic or Latino (of any race), and 4.1% Asian Alone \u2014with a significant geographic disparity. The median household income for 2011-2015 was $70,848 but 17.3% of the population was living in poverty. i Moreover, because of the District's proximity to Maryland and Virginia, individuals flow freely between the three jurisdictions, particularly persons who inject drugs. This overview informs the nature of the opioid problem as well as the DC Department of Behavioral Health's (DBH) planned response. On a national scale, the opioid epidemic is unprecedented. For 2015, SAMHSA's National Survey on Drug Use and Health reports 871,000 past-year users of heroin ii and 3.8 million misusers of pain relievers.iii In the District, the same survey reports 3,000 heroin users (there are no state- level estimates of non-medical use of pain relievers).iv Among high school students, YRBS shows that 4.6% of students report past-year heroin use and 13.5% report past-year non-medical use of prescription pain medications. While the District has had a long-standing population of heroin users, which has remained largely constant over the decades, these youth statistics are troubling (and are the impetus for youth-focused prevention in the District). Moreover, the District's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) reports that opioid overdose deaths nearly tripled between 2013 and 2016, from 83 to 216. National data also show that the District's treatment system is feeling the consequences of increased opioid abuse. According to TEDS, the number of treatment admissions for heroin in the District increased from 1,187 in 2013 to 1,517 in 2015 ( 28%). TEDS also reports that admissions for non-heroin opiates more than doubled between 2013 and 2015, from 47 to 112. While much smaller in absolute terms, this is still a disconcerting trend. This report examines the District's opioid situation in more detail in an effort to assess needs using District-level data. Opioid-Involved Overdoses: Fatal & Non-Fatal Fatal Overdoses According to the DC Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) there were 114 opioid-related fatal overdoses in 2015 and 216 such deaths in 2016, an 89% increase. v In fact, there were only 83 fatal overdoses in 2013, indicating a 160% increase over three years. Based on U.S. Census estimates, these figures translate to 31.71 fatal overdoses per 100,000 for 2016. vi As of this writing, DBH was able to obtain data only for January and February of 2017, in which OCME recorded 24 opioid related deaths. However, given the small sample size, we will not extrapolate those numbers into a declining rate for 2017.

Men constituted 73% of the 114 fatal opioid overdoses in 2015 and 78% of such overdoses in 2016. African Americans accounted for 75% of fatal opioid overdoses in 2015 and 83% of those fatalities in 2016. In 2016, individuals between the ages of 50 and 69 accounted for 67% of the fatal opioid overdoes (40% in the 50-59 age group; 27% in 60-69 age group), demonstrating that the District's fatal overdoses are skewing towards older residents. In contrast, the 30-39 age group accounted for 8% and the 20-29 age group accounted for only 6%. 0100200300 Year 2015 Year 2016Total by Sex Male Female 85179 29 300 5 0 2 0200 2015 2016Number of Opioid -Related Fatal Overdoses by Race and Ethnicity Black White Hispanic Race/Ethnicity Other Unknown Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia Page 79 of 122 Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia - OMB 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 140 of 296DC Department of Behavioral Health Opioid STR Needs Assessment 4 Data from OCME also reveal important geographical variation in fatal opioid overdoses, indicating that Wards 5, 7, and 8 collectively account accounted for 44% ( n=95) of the fatal opioid overdoses in 2016. Notably Ward 6 saw a significant increase in fatalities from 2015 to 2016 (almost equaling the rate in Wards 5, 7 & 8), while Ward 8 experienced a small reduction over the same period. Fatality data indicate that Wards 5, 7, 8 and 6 are at the greatest risk. Importantly, the specific drugs detected among fatal overdose victims changed between 2015 and 2016. Heroin was present in 75% of the fatal overdoses in 2015 but only 65% of fatal overdoses in 2016. In contrast, the presence of fentanyl and its analogs increased dramatically over the same period, from 30% in 2015 to 76% in 2016. And prescription opiates were involved with a larger absolute number of overdoses in 2016 than 2015, but accounted for roughly similar (albeit growing) percentage in both years (25% in 2015; 30% in 2016). These data indicate that fentanyl constitutes the single largest fatal overdose threat, followed closely by heroin. However, these findings also indicate that most individuals who overdose are using many kinds of opiates, as more than one drug is usually present in each case. 1 7 102448221 1 014 193786 0 10 20 30 40Ward Opioid -Related Fatal Residence 2016 2015 Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia Page 80 of 122 Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia - OMB 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 141 of 296DC Behavioral Health Opioid STR Needs Assessment 5 OCME data also show that methadone was present in the largest share of fatalities involving a prescription opioid \u2014in 2015 (n=9) and 2016 (n=20)\u2014indicating that methadone may be utilized as a drug of abuse or, alternatively, that individuals enrolled in methadone MAT may be overdosing on other opioids while still taking their prescribed methadone. Buprenorphine was also present in four fatal overdoses in 2015 and seven fatal overdoses in 2016. The implications of these findings are discussed in more detail in under Opioid Service Gaps. Non-Fatal Overdoses In addition to data on fatal overdoses, the District also collects data on non-lethal opioid - related admissions at eight primary hospitals in the city. 1 In the 12-month period between June 1, 2016 and May 31, 2017, there were 666 incidents of acute opioid poisoning, 847 incidents of suspected acute opioid poisoning , 1,416 incidents of a non-acute opioid problem, and 2, 335 incidents of a suspected overdose-related complaint.2 1 Howard University Hospital does not record data at the same level of detail as others . All of Howard's 413 potential opioid -related incidents are complaint.\" 2 \"Acute opioid poisoning\" poisoning was the discharge diagnosis code; \"suspected acute poisoning \" is a non -poisoning opioid discharge diagnosis code and overdose/unresponsiveness/poisoning as the chief complaint; \" Non-acute opioid problem \" is a non -poisoning opioid discharge diagnosis code without overdose/unresponsiveness/poisoning in the chief aint; and \"suspected overdose -related complaint \" is overdose/unresponsiveness/poisoning in the chief complain t but no of Opioid -Related Fatalities by Drug and Year Year 2015 Year 2016 666 847141623355264 0200040006000 Acute Opioid Poisoning Suspected Suspected OD(Chief Complaint)TotalNon-Fatal Opioid -Related 2016 to May 31, 2017 Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia Page 81 of 122 Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia - OMB 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 142 of 296DC Health Opioid STR Needs Assessment 6 Non-fatal overdoses appear to adhere largely to the demographic trends observed for fatal overdoses. Non -fatal overdoses are significantly more common in the 45-64 age group, with individuals in that range accounting for 58% of the acute overdoses and 59% of the suspected acute poisonings. Similarly, males accounted for 68% of confirmed acute opioid poisoning incidents and 69% of suspected acute poisonings. Hospital data do not currently allow for accurate reporting on race/ethnicity. Geographically, non-fatal overdoses were broadly similar to fatal overdoses\u2014concentrated in Wards 5, 7, and 8. Together, those 3 wards accounted for 53% of acute opioid poisonings and 54% of suspected acute opioid poisonings (only slight ly larger than their collective share of fatal overdoses) . Notably, however, Ward 8 had significantly more non-fatal overdoses than any other ward, despite having roughly similar numbers of fatal overdoses to Wards 5 and 7. 5 5 4249 48 67 105350 108 137275516387500889 910 118 138 Complaint)Non-Fatal Opioid -Related Hospital Encounters by Age; June 1, 2016 to May 31, 2017 17 and younger 18-29 30-44 45-64 65 and older 210 Complaint)Non-Fatal Opioid -Related Hospital Encounters by Gender; June 1, to May 31, 2017 Male Female Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia Page 82 of 122 Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia - OMB 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 143 of 296DC Department of Behavioral Health Opioid STR Needs Assessment 7 Finally, these data allow us to view non-fatal overdose data by specific hospital, and therefore by geography. Unfortunately, data from Howard University Hospital do not allow for comparisons of acute and suspected acute poisonings. Looking at data for the other seven hospitals, United Medical Center (Ward 8) accounts for 38% of acute opioid poisoning incidents, followed by Washington Hospital Center (Ward 5) with 20%, Providence (Ward 5) with 15%, Georgetown (Ward 2) with 14%, George Washington (Ward 2) with 12%. Children's Hospital (Ward 5) and Sibley Memorial (Ward 3) appear to see very few confirmed opioid overdoses, though this may be a function of different data reporting schemas. These data reflect the geographic concertation of the fatal overdoses\u2014in that hospitals in Ward 8 and Ward 5 see the largest share of opioid-related incidents. Examining the broadest definition of overdose to include Howard University Hospital, the trends continue largely similarly\u2014but with Howard seeing the second-largest number of incidents (after United). These data are valuable to for targeting additional resources under STR.

After passing legislation to create the PDMP in 2014, program registration began July 1, 2016\u2014with database information access beginning in October 2016. The DC PDMP collects data on Schedule II-V drugs. Presently, the District's PDMP allows for individual-level PDMP reporting for prescribers, pharmacists, law enforcement, licensing boards, and others (e.g., the state Medicaid office). However, because the PDMP is still relatively new, as of this writing, the District does not have the ability to conduct aggregate analytics for research and planning purposes, including those that would reveal opioid and/or benzodiazepine prescriptions per 100 persons. As a result, the District cannot currently use PDMP data to locate areas that are at the highest risk for overprescribing, misuse, or diversion. DOH is currently acquiring these analytic capabilities (with the help of a CDC grant discussed below) and will work with DBH, the Heroin Task Force, and other relevant stakeholders to effectively utilize these analytic capabilities to assess the scope of opioid and benzodiazepine prescriptions and craft targeted prevention and treatment approaches, as warranted. Notably, a small amount of data is available from the OCME on the presence of prescription drugs in fatal overdoses. For all fatal opioid overdoses in 2016, methadone was present in 9% of cases, oxycodone was present in 6%, codeine in 5%, and buprenorphine in 3%. All other drugs for which OCME tests were present in less than 3% of cases. PDMP Policy/Legislation Under District law, dispensers are required to report all reportable-dispensations; however, neither prescribers nor dispensers are required to query the system prior to writing a prescription for or issuing a controlled substance. Medication Assisted Treatment, Program Capacity & Demographics The District's SUD treatment system is partially bifurcated. DBH certifies \"providers\" but does not have jurisdiction over private physicians or physician groups. DBH's treatment system has 30 certified substance abuse treatment providers, of which 16 have contracts (Human Care Agreements, HCAs) to provide treatment services on DBH's behalf. The 30 certified providers operate 48 facilities throughout the cit y. The District has four (4) DBH-certified Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs), three of which have HCAs. In addition, the District has 77 Office-Based Opioid Treatment (OBOT) providers; however, OBOTs are not under DBH jurisdiction and are not counted as \"providers \" above. OBOTs are discussed in more detail below.

Demographically, these individuals are similar to those suffering fatal and non-fatal overdoses. For FY2016, 52% of these individuals were between the ages of 50 and 69. 5 Individuals using opioids were 70% male (n=1, 716) and 89% African American (n=2,293). In addition, 16% reported a housing status of \"homeless\", another 27% reported \"dependent living\", and 56% were living i ndependently . These housing status data serve to further highlight the challenges faced by the District's opioid users as well as by the public SUD system serving them.6 District Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs ) The four DBH-certified methadone OTPs are located in Wards 2, 3, 6, and 8. They have a cumulative capacity of 2,015 (of which 1,825 slots are for public-pay clients). DBH has contracts with Good Hope Institute, United Planning Organization (UPO), and Partners in Drug Rehabilitation Counseling (PIDARC) to provide publicly funded methadone MAT. All OTPs provide psychosocial interventions either in-house or on a contract basis, per the terms of their certification and as required by District law. 3 This report uses client assessments because DBH's system renders this the most accessible dataset. Not all of the 6,008 unique clients who received ass essments enrolled in treatment. So, this constitutes a slig ht over count of the treatment admissions but provides a rich dataset for analysis and offers a proxy measure for new enrollments. 4 There were also five cases where the primary drug of choice was non -prescription methadone. 5 Another 28% (n=734) were 80+ years old . This seems to be a data error and has been excluded from analyses. 6 Ward of residence data was not immediately available at the time of thi s publication.

These increases were driven by a significant expansion at Good Hope (from 430 to 720) and PIDARC (from 306 to 841). Enrollment at UPO actually declined over the same period (from 528 to 488). Enrollment at the three contracted OTPs was 60% male in FY2016. Though data were not available at the time of this writing, they are consistent with the demographics found throughout this report District Office -Based Opioid Treatment (OBOTs ) According to SAMHSA and DC DOH, there are 77 office-based opioid treatment (OBOT) locations in the District, spread across all 8 Wards (See map). Seven of the OBOT practitioners are also certified by DC Department of Health Care Finance (DHCF) to provide office-based MAT through Medicaid. As indicated on the map, the Medicaid-certified OBOTs are located in Wards 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8. There are currently no OBOTs accepting Medicaid clients in Wards 1, 3, or 4. Office -Based Opioid Treatment Locations (Medicaid vs. Private Pay) 7 DBH does not have access to information on private -pay clients .

Moreover, DBH is aware that at least one physician (Dr. Edwin Chapman) has been approved to treat up to the new limit of 275 patients. Because these practitioners are not subject to DBH regulation, DBH does not currently have data on whether they are prescribing up to their capacity. For updates to the needs assessment, DBH may be able to obtain data on clients served under Medicaid from DHCF but currently has no mechanism for tracking private-pay clients. Moreover, as part of an FY2017 effort to enhance buprenorphine-based MAT, DOH has awarded funds to one provider to conduct capacity building and support a needs assessment and targeted delivery of training, capacity building activities, and technical support to clinicians (physicians, NPs, PAs, clinical pharmacists) to apply for or already waived to prescribe buprenorphine-based treatment. DBH will work to ensure that STR funds support but do not supplant these efforts. And future needs assessments will include updates on this DOH-funded expansion. DOH aims to increase the number of active prescribing physicians by 300%. DBH will work closely with DOH to improve the coordination of an OBOT expansion. Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and Look-A- Likes There are seven Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) with 35 locations throughout the city. They are: Community of Hope (Ward 1, Ward 5, and Ward 8) Elaine Ellis Center of Health (Ward 7) Family and Medical Counseling Services (Ward 8) La Clinica Del Pueblo (Ward 1) Mary's Center for Maternal & Child Care Inc. (Wards 1, 4, & 5)- does opioid treatment but not DBH SUD certified Unity Health Care Inc. (Wards 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 & 8) Whitman Walk Clinic (Wards 2 & 8)- does opioid treatment but not DBH SUD certified There is also one FQHC Look-A-Like, Bread for the City, with two additional locations in Wards 6 and 8. Of these FQHCs, only two\u2014Mary's Center and Whitman Walker Clinic\u2014are currently providing opioid treatment services. Data on the number of opioid clients served at these FQHCs is not available to DBH at the time of this writing because FQHCs are only subject to DBH if they are also certified SUD treatment providers. DBH may be able to obtain data on Medicaid-funded treatment at FQHCs to enhance future planning efforts.

This project is still in its infancy, so DOH does not have any data yet. DBH will work with DOH to support this effort. These sites may not be fully accounted for the RSS section below. Detoxification & Hospitals There are 10 hospitals in the District, in Wards 1, 2, 3, 5, & 8. The eight primary hospitals are: Children' s National Medical Center (Ward 5) Georgetown Univ.

Of the certified RSS providers, eight currently provide District-funded RSS. In addition, all but one of the certified RSS providers are also DBH-cer tified SUD treatment providers. There are certified RSS providers in every ward except Ward 3. See the map below. DOH is also working to enhance the RSS capabilities of four selected FQHCs. RSS Providers, Certified Only & DBH -Partnered DBH-certified RSS providers may provide any of the following eight (8) services: Recovery Support Evaluation, Recovery Support Management, Recovery Coaching, Life Skills Support Services, Education Support Services, Recovery Social Activities, Transportation (Public), and (in certain cases) Environmental Stability. There is currently no opioid specific training or component to DBH's RSS certification system or to the specific recovery services described above. Furthermore, demographic and utilization data opioid RSS clients are not available at the time of this writing. Recovery Coaches & Peer Specialists DBH has two local recovery-related positions: Recovery Coaches and Peer Specialists. 8 Within DBH, any individual can become a Recovery Coach (regardless of lived experience) by taking DBH's Recovery Coach training. The first Recovery Coach Training was held in April 2017 with 19 attendees, of which 11 were non-DBH staff.

Currently, DBH does not have a national certification program for Recovery Coaching. In addition, DBH has a Peer Specialist Certification Program housed in the Office of Consumer and Family Administration. To be eligible for the certification, an individual must be (a) a self-disclosed current or previous consumer of behavioral health services within the DBH network living in recovery with mental illness and/or substance use disorder (or a family member), (b) able to demonstrate personal recovery, and (c) show an ability to help others with their recovery. The six -week certification program requires the completion of classroom work, an 80- hour unpaid field practicum with a District community-based behavioral health provider, and a score of at least 85% on the certification exam. Once certified, peer specialists may: (1) Assist in the development of strengths-based personal goals, (2) Help a peer monitor individual progress and advocate for effective services (3) Model effective coping techniques and self-help strategies, (3) Act as a mentor or facilitator to help resolve issues, (4) Educate on how to navigate the behavioral health system, and (5) Build Community supports. The Peer Specialist program began in 2002. Re-Integration for Persons Released from Incarceration DBH recently signed an MOU with the DC Department of Corrections (DOC) through the Residential Substance Abuse Treatment (RSAT) program that will allow individuals to be assessed 10 days prior to release from incarceration. Based on their need, those clients can be referred directly from DOC to receive substance abuse and mental health services. This arrangement also allows DOC to use DBH's electronic health records system. Future iterations of the needs assessment will provide additional information on this new partnership and document a number of efforts under the Mayor's Office of Returning Citizen Affairs. Naloxone -Related Efforts Naloxone is administered in the community and through DC Fire and EMS Department (FEMS). Currently, the District's community naloxone distribution system is handled primarily by DOH. DOH has also worked with DHCF to ensure open prescription for naloxone (removing prior authorization) under both fee-for-service Medicaid and all three of the District's Medicaid Managed Care Organizations (MCOs). DBH's prevention branch is beginning to work much more closely with DOH, given the importance of naloxone in avoiding fatal opioid overdoses. Community -Level Naloxone Efforts DOH developed a Community Naloxone Pilot Program to train staff and community members to administer naloxone. Under the program, DOH provides naloxone training and kits to Helping Individual Persons Succeed (HIPs) and Family and Medical Counseling Services, which is also a DBH-certified SUD treatment provider and an FQHC. In addition, naloxone is disseminated through 12 needle exchange sites, located in every ward in the District except Ward 2. Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia Page 90 of 122 Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia - OMB 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 151 of 296DC Behavioral Health Opioid STR Needs Assessment 15 DOH uses the peer educator model at HIPS and Family Medical to provide additional outreach in the community . 30 trained peers can administer naloxone, help disseminate important information (data-based messages on spikes in overdoses etc.), and link clients to support services. Initially, DOH resupplied each site with naloxone kits on-demand; however, after encountering supply issues, D OH modified the system. First, DOH kept an \"emergency\" supply of to meet short term needs. Eventually DOH developed a standing monthly order to alleviate these concerns , now allocating 50-75 kits for each site per-month, based on observed trends. Over 1,000 kits were distributed since September 2016, and DOH has purchased an addition 2,500 for future distribution, focusing on Wards 5,7, and 8\u2014which have been identified as the areas of greatest need (both in this report and previously by DOH). DOH recently trained 140 community partners and volunteers between September 2016 and May 2017. Naloxone trainings are currently conducted monthly and the primary participants have been members of the pilot sites. However, trainings have also included staff from: The Metropolitan Police Department, the DC Public Court System, pharmacies, hospitals, and the DC Department of Corrections. DOH has also conducted targeted outreach to FQHCs and the DC Primary Care Association and is now seeking to directly target emergency room provi ders, the DC Department of Corrections, the DC Public Library, and the DC Department of Parks and Recreation for additional trainings. DOH has committed to financing the trainings locally for 3 years but is also seeking grant options. FEMS Naloxone Efforts DC Fire and EMS Department (FEMS) also administers naloxone and collects data on those administrations. Broadly, rates of administration have increased significantly since January of 2015. Peak monthly administration topped out at 314 in June of 2016. However, the mean annual administrations have also been steadily rising, with an average of 145 monthly administrations in 2015, 247 in 2016, and 236 in the first 4 months of 2017 (note that winter months historically have fewer administrations). In addition, demographically, individuals who receive naloxone from FEMS are broadly similar to individuals who suffer opioid-related overdoses (fatal or non-fatal) and to individuals assessed by DBH's public SUD treatment system. Individuals receiving naloxone were 90% African American, 74% male, and 52% ages 51-70 (with another 16% ages 41-50). Non-Naloxone Prevention Systems & Initiatives DBH's Substance Use Disorder Services (SUDS) Prevention branch shepherds much of SUD prevention efforts in the District (though, as noted, the naloxone-related prevention is under DOH). Taken together, DBH's efforts seek to prevent or delay the onset of alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use among District residents\u2014with a particular focus on youth. Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia Page 91 of 122 Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia - OMB 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 152 of 296DC Behavioral Health Opioid STR Needs Assessment 16 DBH has four DC Prevention Centers, which serve as prevention hubs throughout the District. As an extension of DBH, they are strategically placed to provide coverage for two wards each. Parent companies receive sub-grants from DBH with support from SABG funding. Each Center has a minimum of one director, one community mobilizer, and one PFS coordinator. The location and service area of each center is as follows: Wards 1 & 2: 1419 Columbia Road, NW, Washington, DC 20009 (Ward 1) Wards 3 & 4: 5335 Wisconsin Avenue, NW, Suite 440, Washington, DC 20015 (Ward 3) Wards 5 & 6: 1022 Maryland Avenue, NE, Washington, DC 20002 (Ward 6) Wards 7 & 8: 3939 Benning Road, NE, Washington, DC 20019 (Ward 7) Over the past several years, the SUDS Prevention branch has been increasing its focus on opioid misuse. In 2017, DBH partnered with a pharmaceutical company and the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America (CADCA) to disseminate 100,000 medication deactivation pouches throughout the District. The pouches provide a safe and responsible method for disposing of unused prescription medication in the home, by combining tap water and 10-15 pills. This reduces unintended use by youth and also produced environme ntal benefits. Pouches were provided via pharmacies (Walgreens, CVS, and Harris Teeter) and community based partners. In addition, using discretionary funding through SAMHSA's SPF Partnership for Success grant, the District is developing an opioid awareness campaign for youth to share messages around the risks associated with prescription medication misuse. This data-driven campaign will be launched in areas within DC where misuse of prescription medication has been more prevalent and is a direct result of data discussed earlier in this report. As an enhancement to the opioid awareness campaign, SAMHSA's STR funding will be used to create prevention messaging for adults who have historically been heroin users, focusing on: the risks associated with heroin use, additives to heroin, and the administration of naloxone. This campaign will be aimed at filling the information gap regarding the risks associated with heroin and other opioid misuse , especially given the recent data indicating the fatalities associated with fentanyl and its analogs. The campaign will improve public safety and reduce overdoses (fatal and non-fatal). Messaging around the District's Good Samaritan law (see below) will be included in the campaign. DOH -Led Prevention Activities DOH is pursuing many opioid-related prevention activities. This section details those for which DBH currently has information. However, DBH will update this section as new information on DOH's ongoing efforts becomes available through further improved collaboration under STR. Needle Exchange Since 2007, DOH has pursued a successful needle exchange program\u2014removing 803,596 needles from the street in 2016 alone, and resulting in a 95% decline in the number of newly diagnosed HIV infections attributable to injection drug use from 2007 to 2016 (from 149 cases to 7 cases). A 2015 study indicates that the District has an estimated 12,000 active injection drug users. viii Data from District needle exchange programs also provide another source of data Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia Page 92 of 122 Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia - OMB 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 153 of 296DC Department of Behavioral Health Opioid STR Needs Assessment 17 on District heroin use, indicating that heroin remains the leading injection drug in the District. DOH leverages needle exchange programs for their access to opioid users and the significant trust developed by their staff. CDC Prescription Drug Overdose Data Driven Prevention Initiative (DDPI) DC DOH received a three-year planning and data-focused DDPI grant from CDC, which provides the District with additional resources to combat prescription drug abuse, diversion, and death related to opioids. This grant includes a needs assessment, stakeholder engagement and identification (and stakeholder meeting), enhancement of the PDMP analytic ability (discussed above), and a focus on the ability to work with broader stakeholders. DBH will partner with DOH to leverage STR and DDPI together and avoid duplication. Opioid -Related Policy & Legislation The District has pursued a host of opioid-related policy and legislative changes to combat the epidemic, most of which are discussed in their relevant sections above. This section will also be updated in future iterations of the needs assessment to reflect the full range of policy changes. MAT Billing Policies and Related Efforts For OTPs, DBH has issued clarifying guidance regarding Medicaid-funded MAT provided through DBH-contracte d OTPs, further explaining required billing codes and procedures. Although MAT administration at OTPs can be billed directly to Medicaid (DHCF), DBH requires therapeutic guidance in each instance, which must be documented to DBH (and billed, as appropriate). DBH also requires a record of dose administration in the DBH system. And DBH clarified the District's requirement of per-encounter billing (vs. service roll up). Notably, for OBOTs and FQHCs, DOH has issued awards this fiscal year (discussed in the appropriate sections of this report), which have the combined short-term goals of (1) securing a training and capacity building provider to support primary care providers to integrate buprenorphine-based treatment for opioid use disorders (2) supporting FQHCs to provide or increase provision of buprenorphine-based MAT and care coordination, (3) enabling FQHCs to obtain the Medicaid enhanced rate for behavioral health services, and (4) increasing the number of providers who are prescribing buprenorphine-based treatment by 300%. Finally, in June 2016, DHCF issued policy in response to identified barriers to OBOT buprenorphine treatment, stating that (1) buprenorphine shall only be dispensed with prior authorization from DHCF (or the clients MCO); (2) prior authorization shall last 12 months; (3) a pharmacist may dispense a 7-day supply while authorization is pending; (4) practitioners must document the ability to provide linkages to counseling; however, strict adherence to regular counseling shall not be a requirement maintaining a patient in treatment or obtaining refills; (5) providers may exceed the standard 24mg/day if clinically justified (but that justification must be included with the prior authorization request); (6) practitioners shall conduct urine tests at least bi-monthly as a quality measure to assess other opiate use but not as a prerequisite for Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia Page 93 of 122 Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia - OMB 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 154 of 296DC Behavioral Health Opioid STR Needs Assessment 18 treatment; (7) there shall be no lifetime limit on buprenorphine, naltrexone, or methadone under Medicaid (FFS or MCO). Task Forces and Councils The District has undertaken several efforts to convene the stakeholders to address the opioid crisis. At the regional level, in 2016, Mayor Muriel Bowser joined the governors of Maryland and Virginia in signing the National Capital Region Compact to Combat Opioid Addiction. The Compact pledges that DC, Maryland, and Virginia will work collaboratively to stop the damaging effects of the opioid epidemic and convened a regional opioid summit in May 2017. In addition, the District has two notable intra-governmental efforts. The interagency Heroin and Opioid Task Force was established in 2014 to strategize solutions to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with District opioid use. On a monthly basis, the Task Force convenes stakeholders from District agencies and regional/federal partners to share data and develop strategies to curtail the heroin epidemic. 9 Data from stakeholders is presented at Task Force meetings and used to enhance syndromic surveillance, analysis, and policy development. DOH support s this task force. In addition, the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia heads a Heroin/Opioid Working Group which aims to curtail the opioid crisis through grass-root initiatives (rather than the policy work of the Task Force). Working with local police, community-based organizations, and outreach teams from District Government agencies, the Working Group implements initiatives that directly target heroin/opioid users and those close to them (e.g., family members). Activities have included direct outreach and engagement and bringing resources directly to locations affected by use (e.g., parks). Staff and resources from the Attorney General's support this effort. Good Samaritan Law & PDMP In 2012, the District passed DC BILL 19-754, \"Good Samaritan Overdose Prevention Amendment Act of 2012.\" The bill provides legal protections for individuals who were victims of overdoses and/or individuals who seek medical assistance for individuals who are victims of overdoses. Finally, District PDMP laws are discussed under the PDMP section above, and naloxone-related policies and legislation are discussed under Naloxone-Related Efforts. Estimated Current Treatment Need Calculating treatment need is difficult. Fortunately, a recent study provides an estimate of 2012 treatment need for the District (and the 50 States) using NSDUH and other SAMHSA data sources . ix The authors report a rate of past year opioid abuse or dependence of 6.7% (with a 95% confidence interval of 3.6% to 12.3% per 1000 resident population 12 years of age or greater) for 2012 . Applying that rate to the current District population age 12 and older yields 9 Participants include: DBH, DOH (Center for Policy Planning and Evaluation & Pharmaceutical Control Division), DHCF, FEMS, OCME, DC Department of Forensic Sciences (DFS), Metropolitan Police Department (MPD), DC Office of the Attorney General (OAG), the Washington Regional Threat Assessment Center/Fusion Team (WRTAC), the US Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia Page 94 of 122 Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia - OMB 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 155 of 296DC Department of Behavioral Health Opioid STR Needs Assessment 19 a treatment need point estimate of 3,919 (with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 2,106 to 7,194 ). These findings are noteworthy given the 2,049 clients enrolled in methadone MAT in FY2016. The same study also reports findings on opioid treatment capacity. It finds that the District's potential buprenorphine treatment capacity rate of 5.8 per 1 ,000 residents age 12 and older (95% C.I . is 5.6 to 6.0) exceeds the average rate for the nation of 4.1 per 1,000 (95% C.I is 4.1- 4.1); likewise, they estimate that OTPs in the District are at 100% capacity compared with the 82.3% average for the rest of the nation. In fact, the District is one of only 13 states where the study reports that all OTPs are operating at full capacity. These findings suggest that the District's MAT system may be better equipped to manage its opioid epidemic, on average, as compared to other states. However, it also indicates that the District may lack the capacity to serve additional clients at current OTPs. The District was not able to employ the Calculating for an Adequate System Tool (CAST) for this report but plans to utilize it in the future. Opioid Service G aps & Lessons Learned Findings from overdose data (fatal and non-fatal) as well as data from DBH's public treatment system demonstrate that: The observable opioid-using population in the District is disproportionately older (roughly, age 40-65), African-American, and male. The observable opioid-using population is concentrated in Wards 5, 7, and 8 (and may be rising in Ward 6). A significant share (16%) of OUD clients receiving assessments through DBH's public SUD treatment were homeless, indicating that OUD is a significant problem in the District's homeless community. Opioid -related fatalities have risen significantly, driven in large-part by fentanyl and its analogs District hospitals (and FEMS) encounter a large number of opioid users (demographically consistent with the description above) and represent an area for improved collaboration to facilitate MAT enrollment. o Wards 6 and 8 lack hospitals yet have significant levels of individuals with OUD. Leading indicators such as youth use of prescription opioids in the YRBS and the doubling of TEDS admissions for prescription opioid abuse indicate a need to get out in front of a potential \"new wave\" of users. Less data is available on prescription opioid users outside of the publicly-funded treatment system and FEMS/overdose data, which makes it difficult to assess the extent of the problem in certain segments of the District population. These data will be useful for targeting a myriad of STR efforts, including (but not limited to): prevention campaigns, treatment capacity (slots) expansion, improved access (including \"warm Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia Page 95 of 122 Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia - OMB 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 156 of 296DC Behavioral Health Opioid STR Needs Assessment 20 handoffs\" to treatment from other points in the system), and treatment quality improvement (including care coordination). More detailed findings are discussed below. OTP Methadone Clinics There are no OTPs in Ward 5 or Ward 7, despite the high concentration of need in these wards. DBH will further explore the implications of this finding.10 All three OTPs that accept publicly funded clients appear to have operated at capacity (2,015) in FY2016. This indicates that OTPs may have limited capacity to expand without significant changes to staffing, structure etc. But it also indicates that the OTPs may be doing a good job responding to the increased need (relative to previous years). OBOTs & FQHCs DOH is currently leading efforts to expand the capacity of OBOTs and work with FQHCs. However, relatively little information is available to DBH as of this writing. DBH will work through the Heroin Task Force to coordinate STR efforts across all relevant agencies. DBH will also seek to work with DOH to establish a baseline capacity for existing OBOTs and FQHCs against which to measure progress as well as furthering the expansion (and working to expand Medicaid-funded services). FQHCs represent an area ripe for MAT expansion and service coordination in the District. Though OBOTs and FQHCs are outside DBH jurisdiction, they are crucial to ensuring a high-quality MAT network. The strategic plan will outline DBH's STR-funded efforts in this regard. RSS Data are not currently available to assess the extent to which DBH's RSS system is able to facilitate access to MAT and support individuals in recovery from OUD. This is a priority area. DBH and DOH will enhance collaboration around recovery-oriented efforts spearheaded by DOH through FQHCs. Peer-based efforts are crucial. DBH and DOH will work collaboratively to streamline peer-based outreach and RSS efforts and enhance existing peer services at DBH to better serve (and target) individuals with OUDs. Areas for Further Exploration The data presented herein do not permit data-based assessments of the potential service gaps regarding: transportation and other access issues, community connections, integration with physical health, family treatment, or recovery supports (including employment/education assistance). Though DBH can provide anecdotal assessments of these needs, future iterations of this needs assessment will focus on these issues in 10 The District's geographic size is a factor . At minimum, this highlights the importance of transportation and access .

In particular, DBH will seek to better assess the ability of OBOTs and OTPs to provide comprehensive, coordinated care\u2014which DBH believes is an area of concern. In addition, this needs assessment reveals both the early successes of the District's intra- governmental cooperation (e.g., the Heroin Task Force) and areas for increased cooperation and infrastructure improvement. Those areas include (not exhaustive): Developing and utilizing analytic capabilities for the District's PDMP, including intra- governme ntal sharing of aggregate date (in progress and also supported by DDPI) o After consultation with DOH, the District may also want to explore laws/policy that mandate PDMP utilization Further developing the collaboration between DBH and DOH's naloxone programs and other prevention efforts Further developing collaboration between DBH and DOH to better monitor, oversee, assess, and expand OBOTs using buprenorphine -based MAT The Heroin Task Force appears to be the ideal forum for much of this enhanced coordination. i U.S. Census Bureau.

Many of these cases involve opioid overdoses. The District's multi-stakeholder, public health approach has yielded progress in saving lives and reducing fatal overdoses, but there is still work to be done to reduce the impact of the epidemic on our city. \"LIVE.LONG.DC,\" Washington, DC's Strategic Plan to Reduce Opioid Use, Misuse and Related Deaths is our blueprint for how best to continue moving forward with urgency and thoughtfulness as we work towards reversing fatal opioid overdoses. The Plan reflects the input of a cross-section of public and private partners, including DC government agencies, hospital leaders, physicians, substance use disorder treatment providers, community-based service providers, federal partners, and individuals in recovery. The updated Plan offers a comprehensive look at prevention, treatment, and recovery, detailing our goals and accompanying strategies to end Washington, DC's opioid epidemic. Our Plan offers additional details on how these goals and strategies will be accomplished in order to ensure District residents can thrive and move forward with the support they need. Working together, the implementation of LIVE.LONG.DC has resulted in some early successes, which include: Reversing more than 1,000 overdoses through naloxone kits and training residents in naloxone use; Increasing the capacity of practitioners to provide Buprenorphine-based medication-assisted treatment (MAT); Monitoring trends in opioid use and tailoring responses and interventions based on real-time data; Increasing testing capacity via surveillance of synthetic opioids in the District, both to discover new synthetic opioids as well as characterize those currently present; and Revising innovative public education campaigns targeting those who are most likely to overdose on heroin and to educate young people on the dangers of misusing prescription opioids. We will continue to work collaboratively to develop and implement strategies that help those facing opioid use disorder. We are devoted to tailoring our response in a manner that is specific to Washington, DC, based on our history, demographics, and trends in usage so that we can stem this epidemic facing our city. I want to thank all who contributed to this thoughtful Plan and those going forward for doing your part to reduce fatal overdoses. Together, we will help all Washingtonians live safer and stronger lives.

Overdoses hit a peak in 2017, with 279 overdoses total, and has since trended downward in 2018. National trends largely reflect new opioid users who are White (non-Hispanic) younger adults who begin their addiction by experimenting with prescription drugs, with the potential of progressing to heroin usage. However, Washington, DC's epidemic affects a unique demographic and presents different trends in use. Washington, DC's Epidemic in A Snapshot Opioid-Related Deaths 350 300 250 200 150 100 50 0 279 231 213* 83 114 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 This graph reflects the trend of opioid overdoses since 2014. *Data for 2018 is subject to change due to cases where cause and manner of death are pending further investigation. There was a 178% increase in fatal overdoses due to opioid use from 2014 to 2016. In 2016, 62% of cases involved fentanyl or a fentanyl analog. In 2017, 71% of cases fentanyl or analogs. Approximately 80% of all overdoses due to opioid drug use happened among adults between the ages of 40 -69, and such deaths were most prevalent among people ages 50- 59. Overall, 81% of all deaths were among African-Americans. This trend has remained consistent across years. Fatal overdoses due to opioid drug use were more common among males (74% of deaths were males). From 2014 to 2017, opioid-related fatal overdoses were most prevalent in Wards 7 and 8. 89% of DC opioid users are over 40 years old and 58% are more than 50 years old. 22% have been using heroin (primary used opioid in Washington, DC) for more than 40 years, 59% for more than 25 years, and 88% for more than 10 years.

This kind of partnership yields expertise in creating agile, cross-discipline, public-private leadership coalitions, rapidly aligning on targets and coordinated actions, and maintaining accountability on outcomes that will cause short- and long-term impacts. In October 2017, a group of 40 stakeholders, representing both the public and private sectors, convened for a summit focused on how to jointly address Washington, DC's opioid epidemic. Out of the summit, the Strategic Planning Working Group was created. In late November 2017, the working group members began to conduct stakeholder engagement sessions to assess what was needed regarding prevention and early intervention, harm reduction, acute treatment, sustained recovery, and criminal justice. The information from these sessions and the feedback from the working group members was used to draft the plan. The draft plan was finalized at the end of February 2018. In March 2018, the working group was convened and membership for the seven Opioid Strategy Groups (OSGs) that would map out the implementation of the goals and associated strategies in the Strategic Plan were formed. Leadership and membership of the OSGs were finalized in April 2018. These groups have been actively working on the goals and related strategies since April 2018. The most recent stakeholder summit was in January 2019, where more than 100 stakeholders attended.

SAMHSA provides decision makers, researchers and the general public with enhanced information about the extent of substance abuse and mental illness, how systems of care are organized and financed, when and how to seek help, and effective models of care, including the outcomes of treatment engagement and recovery. SAMHSA also provides Congress and the nation reports about the use of block grant and other SAMHSA funding to impact outcomes in critical areas, and is moving toward measures for all programs consistent with SAMHSA's NBHQF . The effort is part of the congressionally mandated National Quality Strategy to assure health care funds - public and private - are used most effectively and efficiently to create better health, better care, and better value. The overarching goals of this effort are to ensure that services are evidence-based and effective or are appropriately tested as promising or emerging best practices; they are person/family-centered; care is coordinated across systems; services promote healthy living; and, they are safe, accessible, and affordable. SAMHSA is currently working to harmonize data collection efforts across discretionary programs and match relevant NBHQF and National Quality Strategy (NQS) measures that are already endorsed by the National Quality Forum (NQF) wherever possible. SAMHSA is also working to align these measures with other efforts within HHS and relevant health and social programs and to reflect a mix of outcomes, processes, and costs of services. Finally, consistent with the Affordable Care Act and other HHS priorities, these efforts will seek to understand the impact that disparities have on outcomes. For the FY 2016-2017 Block Grant Application, SAMHSA has begun a transition to a common substance abuse and mental health client-level data (CLD) system. SAMHSA proposes to build upon existing data systems, namely TEDS and the mental health CLD system developed as part of the Uniform Reporting System. The short-term goal is to coordinate these two systems in a way that focuses on essential data elements and minimizes data collection disruptions. The long-term goal is to develop a more efficient and robust program of data collection about behavioral health services that can be used to evaluate the impact of the block grant program on prevention and treatment services performance and to inform behavioral health services research and policy. This will include some level of direct reporting on client-level data from states on unique prevention and treatment services purchased under the MHBG and SABG and how these services contribute to overall outcomes. It should be noted that SAMHSA itself does not intend to collect or maintain any personal identifying information on individuals served with block grant funding. This effort will also include some facility-level data collection to understand the overall financing and service delivery process on client-level and systems-level outcomes as individuals receiving services become eligible for services that are covered under fee-for-service or capitation systems, which results in encounter reporting. SAMHSA will continue to work with its partners to look at current facility collection efforts and explore innovative strategies, including survey methods, to gather facility and client level data. The initial draft set of measures developed for the block grant programs can be found at http://www.samhsa.gov/data/quality-metrics/block- grant-measures . These measures are being discussed with states and other stakeholders. To help SAMHSA determine how best to move forward with our partners, each state must identify its current and future capacity to report these measures or measures like them, types of adjustments to current and future state-level data collection efforts necessary to submit the new streamlined performance measures, technical assistance needed to make those adjustments, and perceived or actual barriers to such data collection and reporting. The key to SAMHSA's success in accomplishing tasks associated with data collection for the block grant will be the collaboration with SAMHSA's centers and offices, the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD), the National Association of State Alcohol Drug Abuse Directors (NASADAD), and other state and community partners. SAMHSA recognizes the significant implications of this undertaking for states and for local service providers, and anticipates that the development and implementation process will take several years and will evolve over time. For the FY 2016-2017 Block Grant Application reporting, achieving these goals will result in a more coordinated behavioral health data collection program that complements other existing systems (e.g., Medicaid administrative and billing data systems; and state mental health and substance abuse data systems), ensures consistency in the use of measures that are aligned across various agencies and reporting systems, and provides a more complete understanding of the delivery of mental health and substance abuse services. Both goals can only be achieved through continuous collaboration with and feedback from SAMHSA's state, provider, and practitioner partners. SAMHSA anticipates this movement is consistent with the current state authorities' movement toward system integration and will minimize challenges associated with changing operational logistics of data collection and reporting. SAMHSA understands modifications to data collection systems may be necessary to achieve these goals and will work with the states to minimize the impact of these changes. States must answer the questions below to help assess readiness for CLD collection described above: 1.Briefly describe the state's data collection and reporting system and what level of data is able to be reported currently (e.g., at the client, program, provider, and/or other levels). 2.Is the state's current data collection and reporting system specific to substance abuse and/or mental health services clients, or is it part of a larger data system? If the latter, please identify what other types of data are collected and for what populations (e.g., Medicaid, child welfare, Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia Page 1 of 2 Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 184 of 296etc.). 3.Is the state currently able to collect and report measures at the individual client level (that is, by client served, but not with client-identifying information)? 4.If not, what changes will the state need to make to be able to collect and report on these measures? Please indicate areas of technical assistance needed related to this section.

Therefore, any state with an AIDS case rate below 10 or more such cases per 100,000 that meets the criteria described in the 2012 policy guidance would will be allowed to obligate and expend SABG funds for EIS/HIV if As such, projections are based on those periods as they are still over a 12 month period.

The Health Care System, Parity and Integration - Question 1 and 2 are Required Narrative Question Persons with mental illness and persons with substance use disorders are likely to die earlier than those who do not have these conditions.22 Early mortality is associated with broader health disparities and health equity issues such as socioeconomic status but \"[h]ealth system factors\" such as access to care also play an important role in morbidity and mortality among these populations. Persons with mental illness and substance use disorders may benefit from strategies to control weight, encourage exercise, and properly treat such chronic health conditions as diabetes and cardiovascular disease.23 It has been acknowledged that there is a high rate of co-occurring M/SUD, with appropriate treatment required for both conditions.24 Currently, 50 states have organizationally consolidated their mental and substance use disorder authorities in one fashion or another with additional organizational changes under consideration. More broadly, SAMHSA and its federal partners understand that such factors as education, housing, and nutrition strongly affect the overall health and well-being of persons with mental illness and substance use disorders.25 SMHAs and SSAs may wish to develop and support partnerships and programs to help address social determinants of health and advance overall health equity.26 For instance, some organizations have established medical-legal partnerships to assist persons with mental and substance use disorders in meeting their housing, employment, and education needs.27 Health care professionals and persons who access M/SUD treatment services recognize the need for improved coordination of care and integration of physical and M/SUD with other health care in primary, specialty, emergency and rehabilitative care settings in the community. For instance, the National Alliance for Mental Illness has published materials for members to assist them in coordinating pediatric mental health and primary care.28 SAMHSA and its partners support integrated care for persons with mental illness and substance use disorders.29 The state should illustrate movement towards integrated systems of care for individuals and families with co-occurring mental and substance use disorders. The plan should describe attention to management, funding, payment strategies that foster co-occurring capability for services to individuals and families with co-occurring mental and substance use disorders. Strategies supported by SAMHSA to foster integration of physical and M/SUD include: developing models for inclusion of M/SUD treatment in primary care; supporting innovative payment and financing strategies and delivery system reforms such as ACOs, health homes, pay for performance, etc.; promoting workforce recruitment, retention and training efforts; improving understanding of financial sustainability and billing requirements; encouraging collaboration between M/SUD providers, prevention of teen pregnancy, youth violence, Medicaid programs, and primary care providers such as Federally Qualified Health Centers; and sharing with consumers information about the full range of health and wellness programs. Health information technology, including EHRs and telehealth are examples of important strategies to promote integrated care.30 Use of EHRs - in full compliance with applicable legal requirements - may allow providers to share information, coordinate care, and improve billing practices. Telehealth is another important tool that may allow M/SUD prevention, treatment, and recovery to be conveniently provided in a variety of settings, helping to expand access, improve efficiency, save time, and reduce costs. Development and use of models for coordinated, integrated care such as those found in health homes31 and ACOs32 may be important strategies used by SMHAs and SSAs to foster integrated care. Training and assisting M/SUD providers to redesign or implement new provider billing practices, build capacity for third-party contract negotiations, collaborate with health clinics and other organizations and provider networks, and coordinate benefits among multiple funding sources may be important ways to foster integrated care. SAMHSA encourages SMHAs and SSAs to communicate frequently with stakeholders, including policymakers at the state/jurisdictional and local levels, and State Mental Health Planning Council members and consumers, about efforts to foster health care coverage, access and integrate care to ensure beneficial outcomes. SMHAs and SSAs also may work with state Medicaid agencies, state insurance commissioners, and professional organizations to encourage development of innovative demonstration projects, alternative payment methodologies, and waivers/state plan amendments that test approaches to providing integrated care for persons with M/SUD and other vulnerable populations.33 Ensuring both Medicaid and private insurers provide required preventive benefits also may be an area for collaboration.34 One key population of concern is persons who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid.35 Roughly, 30 percent of persons who are dually eligible have been diagnosed with a mental illness, more than three times the rate among those who are not dually eligible.36 SMHAs and SSAs also should collaborate with state Medicaid agencies and state insurance commissioners to develop policies to assist those individuals who experience health insurance coverage eligibility changes due to shifts in income and employment.37 Moreover, even with expanded health coverage available through the Marketplace and Medicaid and efforts to ensure parity in health care coverage, persons with M/SUD conditions still may experience challenges in some areas in obtaining care for a particular condition or in finding a provider.38 SMHAs and SSAs should remain cognizant that health disparities may affect access, health care coverage and integrated care of M/SUD conditions and work with Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia Page 1 of 6 Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia - OMB 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 204 of 296partners to mitigate regional and local variations in services that detrimentally affect access to care and integration. SMHAs and SSAs should work with partners to ensure recruitment of diverse, well-trained staff and promote workforce development and ability to function in an integrated care environment.39 Psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, addiction counselors, preventionists, therapists, technicians, peer support specialists, and others will need to understand integrated care models, concepts, and practices. Parity is vital to ensuring persons with mental health conditions and substance use disorders receive continuous, coordinated, care. Increasing public awareness about MHPAEA could increase access to M/SUD services, provide financial benefits to individuals and families, and lead to reduced confusion and discrimination associated with mental illness and substance use disorders. Block grant recipients should continue to monitor federal parity regulations and guidance and collaborate with state Medicaid authorities, insurance regulators, insurers, employers, providers, consumers and policymakers to ensure effective parity implementation and comprehensive, consistent communication with stakeholders. The SSAs, SMHAs and their partners may wish to pursue strategies to provide information, education, and technical assistance on parity-related issues. Medicaid programs will be a key partner for recipients of MHBG and SABG funds and providers supported by these funds. The SSAs and SMHAs should collaborate with their states' Medicaid authority in ensuring parity within Medicaid programs. SAMHSA encourages states to take proactive steps to improve consumer knowledge about parity. As one plan of action, states can develop communication plans to provide and address key issues. Another key part of integration will be defining performance and outcome measures. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and partners have developed the National Quality Strategy, which includes information and resources to help promote health, good outcomes, and patient engagement. SAMHSA's National Behavioral Health Quality Framework includes core measures that may be used by providers and payers.40 SAMHSA recognizes that certain jurisdictions receiving block grant funds - including U.S. Territories, tribal entities and those jurisdictions that have signed a Compact of Free Association with the United States and are uniquely impacted by certain Medicaid provisions or are ineligible to participate in certain programs.41 However, these jurisdictions should collaborate with federal agencies and their governmental and non- governmental partners to expand access and coverage. Furthermore, the jurisdiction should ensure integration of prevention, treatment, and recovery support for persons with, or at risk of, mental and substance use disorders. 22 BG Druss et al.

D.C. Healthy Communities Collaborative (DCHCC) Community Health Needs Assessment: The DCHCC includes: 1) a coalition of four (4) hospitals: Children's National Health System, Howard University Hospital, Providence Health System, and Sibley Memorial Hospital); 2) four (4) federally qualified health centers (Bread for the City, Community of Hope, Mary's Center, and Unity Health Care); and 3) two (2) associations (D.C. Hospital Association and D.C. Primary Care Association). The DCHCC authored the June 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment Report to serve as an evidence-based, community-driven foundation for community health improvement efforts. Four (4) priority community needs emerged: 1) mental health (prevention and treatment of psychological, emotional, and relational issues that lead to higher quality of life); 2) place-based care/bringing care to the community (care options that are convenient and culturally sensitive); 3) care coordination (deliberate organization of patient care activities and information-sharing protocols among all of the participants concerned with a patient's care to achieve safer and more effective care); and 4) health literacy (ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions). Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs): More commonly known as Community Health Centers (CHCs) are community-based and patient-directed primary care centers. They serve those who have limited access to health care and include low-income individuals, the uninsured and underinsured, immigrants, those who are homeless, and those who live in public housing. Community of Hope - creates opportunities for low-income families in the District, including those experiencing homelessness to achieve good health, a stable home, family-sustaining income, and hope. There are three (3) locations in the District. Elaine Ellis Center of Health - Provides comprehensive primary care and social services to residents in the District. Family and Medical Counseling Services - employ community-based, culturally competent approaches to provide comprehensive services that promote the competent emotional approaches to provide comprehensive services that promote the emotional and physical health of families and individuals, regardless of income or socioeconomic status to maximize the quality of life. La Clinica Del Pueblo- serves the Latino and immigrant populations of the Washington DC metropolitan area. The goal is to provide culturally appropriate health services, focusing on those most in need. Mary's Center for Maternal and Child Care, Inc.- Provides health care, family literacy, and social services to individuals whose needs often go unmet by the public and private systems. It uses a holistic, multipronged approach to help each participant access individualized services that set them on the path toward good health, stable families, and economic independence.

Unity Health Care has ten clinics sites, 11 homeless sites, three school-based health centers, and two other specialty sites. Whitman Walker Clinic- The mission is to provide high quality, culturally competent community health center services to District's diverse urban community, including individuals who face barriers to accessing care, and with special expertise in Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer (LGBTQ) and HIV care. There are two (2) centers in the District. Bread for the City- This FQHC look-a-like provides District residents with comprehensive services, including food, clothing, medical care, and legal and social services. There are two (2) centers in the District. Integration of Behavioral Health and Primary Care Health Homes/MY DC Health Home: The District of Columbia's (District) Department of Health Care Finance (DHCF) is launching a care coordination benefit for Medicaid beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions, called My Health GPS. As part of the District's My Health GPS program, interdisciplinary teams embedded in the primary care setting will serve as the central point for integrating and coordinating the full array of eligible beneficiaries' primary, acute, behavioral health, and long-term services and supports to improve health outcomes and reduce avoidable and preventable hospital admissions and ER visits. Unlike DHCF's initial Medicaid Health Home benefit (My DC Health Home) where individuals must have a severe mental illness to receive services, the My Health GPS program will deliver care coordination services to beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions, enrolled in either Fee-For-Service or Managed Care. The District's My Health GPS program began in July 2017. The Health Home State Plan benefit, which targets individuals with severe and persistent mental illness, and aim to: (1) improve the integration of physical and behavioral health care; (2) lower rates of hospital emergency department use; (3) reduce avoidable hospital admissions and re-admissions; (4) reduce healthcare costs; (5) improve the experience of care, quality of life and consumer satisfaction; and (6) improve health outcomes. Medicaid providers that deliver Health Home services are DBH certified Core Services Agencies and Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) providers that meet specific standards as part of DBH's Health Home certification process. Health Home providers serve as the central point for coordinating patient-centered and population-focused care and will be responsible for integrating behavioral and primary care for eligible individuals. Health Home providers utilize a team-based approach, built on evidence-based care management guidelines. Providers also collaborate with DC Medicaid Managed Care Organizations (MCOs), Dual-Eligible Special Needs Plans (D-SNPs), primary care providers (PCPs) and hospitals for the exchange of data critical to ensuring that the right people receive services, at the right time. Health Homes 2/MYHealth GPS: The District of Columbia's (District) Department of Health Care Finance (DHCF) is launching a care coordination benefit for Medicaid beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions, called My Health GPS. As part of the District's My Health GPS program, interdisciplinary teams embedded in the primary care setting will serve as the central point for integrating and coordinating the full array of eligible beneficiaries' primary, acute, behavioral health, and long-term services and supports to improve health outcomes and reduce avoidable and preventable hospital admissions and ER visits. Unlike DHCF's initial Medicaid Health Home benefit (My DC Health Home) where individuals must have a severe mental illness. DC Mental Health Access in Pediatrics (DC MAP): To promote the integration of behavioral health and primary care, DBH developed the Quality Improvement Mental Health Learning Collaborative and the DC Mental Health Access in Pediatrics (DC-MAP) program. There are two primary initiatives: 1) annual, universal mental health screening through the pediatric primary care provider and 2) DC Mental Health Access in Pediatrics (DC MAP), a children's mental health consultation program for pediatricians and primary care physician practices. Through the DC-MAP, DBH works with pediatricians to identify problems early and conduct an annual mental health screening within a primary care visit. This initiative promotes the integration of behavioral health and primary care for children and recognizes mental wellness as part of good health. To support the program, DHCF issued a new billing code for mental health screening during an annual well-child visit. This unique code also allows the collection of data on the number of screens completed and the number of positive screens across the District Participating practices serve children in all wards and cover approximately 80 percent of the children enrolled in Medicaid. Practices also have access to an on-call child psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, and a care coordinator for behavioral health consultation regarding diagnosis or medication management. The Assessment and Referral Center (ARC), under the Clinical Services Administration, is the primary entry-point for adults (21 years and older), seeking publicly funded treatment for SUD and referrals for other services. The ARC is a walk-in and appointment- based facility which conducts treatment assessments, TB, HIV/HEP-C Testing services, HIV pre and post counseling, linkage, and referral to treatment. ARC clinicians conduct Substance Use Disorder (SUD) Assessments and referral to SUD Treatment.

The consultant report reviewed findings from the literature on local and national efforts to prevent and manage physical aggression in youth, included information on effective screening, evidence-based approaches to intervention/treatment, outcomes, and limitations. The consultant conducted initial planning calls with representatives of the two impacted acute inpatient care hospitals, followed by on-site visits, presentations of materials, discussed options and provided guidance to meet the District's needs. A follow-up consultation will be provided remotely as needed to help ensure successful the implementation of recommendations. 2. Describe how the state provide services and supports towards integrated systems of care for individuals and families with co- occurring mental and substance use disorders, including management, funding, payment strategies that foster co-occurring capability. Approximately 70% of SUD clients have also received mental health services within the same year. This data has facilitated the need to fully integrate the two systems and address the client's needs for co-occurring care. DBH has made significant progress in building the necessary infrastructure and a coordinated, integrated system of care for substance abuse treatment and recovery services, since the merger of the two (2) agencies in FY 2014. The District continues to develop access to care for individuals needing co-occurring treatment. The award of the State Youth Treatment (SYT) grant from SAMHSA has enabled the District to enhance co-occurring treatment within the adolescent treatment network; the Adolescent-Community Reinforcement habilitation Approach (A-CRA) was selected as the evidence-based practice to implement the SYT services. The A-CRA model incorporates primary care into the treatment modality as well as the various other family and community supports. The Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach (A-CRA) is a behavioral intervention that seeks to replace environmental contingencies that have supported alcohol or drug use. This outpatient program uses pro-social activities and behaviors that support recovery and has guidelines for three types of sessions: adolescents alone, parents/caregivers alone, and adolescents and parents/caregivers together. Seventeen different A-CRA procedures address, for example, problem-solving skills to cope with day-to-day stressors, communication skills, and active participation in pro-social activities to improve life satisfaction and eliminate alcohol and substance use problems. Role- playing/behavioral rehearsal is a critical component of the skills training used in A-CRA, particularly for the acquisition of better communication and relapse prevention skills. Homework between sessions consists of practicing skills learned during sessions and participating in prosocial leisure activities. This initiative focuses on capacity building within both the adolescent and adult SUD treatment provider networks, as well as the workforce in the adolescent system. In FY 2017, continuing into FY 2018, DBH has expanded these services to the transitional aged youth (TAY) in the Adult Substance Abuse Rehabilitation Services (ASARS) programs, which is Medicaid reimbursable. Additionally, in July 2017, D.C. Department of Health Care Finance (DHCF), the single state agency for Medicaid, launched My Health GPS. DHCF a per member per month payment to approved primary care providers who deliver comprehensive care management services to District Medicaid beneficiaries with three or more qualifying chronic conditions. Primary care providers through incentivized payments will be held accountable for providing and coordinating patient's care with others as defined in the individualized care plan. Services rendered are geared toward 1) improving the integration of physical and behavioral health care, and 2) reducing health care costs by the reduction of Medicaid beneficiaries' use of emergency department non-emergency visits, and 3) the reducing preventable hospital admissions and re-admissions. The primary care provider is also expected to improve the quality of care and quality of services delivered and improve health outcomes. Eligibility for Health Homes 1 is determined by an individual having a serious mental illness only. A mental health provider is responsible for providing mental health services and coordinating care with the primary provider as well as family members and stakeholders as defined in the individualized care plan. There is no incentive payment at this point for Health Home 1 providers. The Medicaid beneficiary can choose the Health Home that best meets his or her needs. At present, a work group comprised of the Department of Behavioral Health and D.C. Department of Health Care Finance (DHCF), the single state agency for Medicaid, are currently utilizing the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) requirements to analyze parity compliance. 3. a) Is there a plan for monitoring whether individuals and families have access to M/SUD services offered through QHPs? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No b) and Medicaid? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No 4.

Health Disparities - Requested Narrative Question In accordance with the HHS Action Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities42, Healthy People, 202043, National Stakeholder Strategy for Achieving Health Equity44, and other HHS and federal policy recommendations, SAMHSA expects block grant dollars to support equity in access, services provided, and M/SUD outcomes among individuals of all cultures, sexual/gender minorities, orientation and ethnicities. Accordingly, grantees should collect and use data to: (1) identify subpopulations (i.e., racial, ethnic, limited English speaking, tribal, sexual/gender minority groups, etc.) vulnerable to health disparities and (2) implement strategies to decrease the disparities in access, service use, and outcomes both within those subpopulations and in comparison to the general population. One strategy for addressing health disparities is use of the recently revised National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services in Health and Health Care (CLAS)45. The Action Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities, which the HHS Secretary released in April 2011, outlines goals and actions that HHS agencies, including SAMHSA, will take to reduce health disparities among racial and ethnic minorities. Agencies are required to assess the impact of their policies and programs on health disparities. The HHS Secretary's top priority in the Action Plan is to \"assess and heighten the impact of all HHS policies, programs, processes, and resource decisions to reduce health disparities. HHS leadership will assure that program grantees, as applicable, will be required to submit health disparity impact statements as part of their grant applications. Such statements can inform future HHS investments and policy goals, and in some instances, could be used to score grant applications if underlying program authority permits.\"46 Collecting appropriate data is a critical part of efforts to reduce health disparities and promote equity. In October 2011, HHS issued final standards on the collection of race, ethnicity, primary language, and disability status47. This guidance conforms to the existing Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directive on racial/ethnic categories with the expansion of intra-group, detailed data for the Latino and the Asian-American/Pacific Islander populations48. In addition, SAMHSA and all other HHS agencies have updated their limited English proficiency plans and, accordingly, will expect block grant dollars to support a reduction in disparities related to access, service use, and outcomes that are associated with limited English proficiency. These three departmental initiatives, along with SAMHSA's and HHS's attention to special service needs and disparities within tribal populations, LGBTQ populations, and women and girls, provide the foundation for addressing health disparities in the service delivery system. States provide M/SUD services to these individuals with state block grant dollars. While the block grant generally requires the use of evidence-based and promising practices, it is important to note that many of these practices have not been normed on various diverse racial and ethnic populations. States should strive to implement evidence-based and promising practices in a manner that meets the needs of the populations they serve. In the block grant application, states define the populations they intend to serve. Within these populations of focus are subpopulations that may have disparate access to, use of, or outcomes from provided services. These disparities may be the result of differences in insurance coverage, language, beliefs, norms, values, and/or socioeconomic factors specific to that subpopulation. For instance, lack of Spanish primary care services may contribute to a heightened risk for metabolic disorders among Latino adults with SMI; and American Indian/Alaska Native youth may have an increased incidence of underage binge drinking due to coping patterns related to historical trauma within the American Indian/Alaska Native community. While these factors might not be pervasive among the general population served by the block grant, they may be predominant among subpopulations or groups vulnerable to disparities. To address and ultimately reduce disparities, it is important for states to have a detailed understanding of who is and is not being served within the community, including in what languages, in order to implement appropriate outreach and engagement strategies for diverse populations. The types of services provided, retention in services, and outcomes are critical measures of quality and outcomes of care for diverse groups. For states to address the potentially disparate impact of their block grant funded efforts, they will address access, use, and outcomes for subpopulations. 42 http://www.minorityhealth.hhs.gov/npa/files/Plans/HHS/HHS_Plan_complete.pdf 43 http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/default.aspx 44 https://www.minorityhealth.hhs.gov/npa/files/Plans/NSS/NSS_07_Section3.pdf 45 http://www.ThinkCulturalHealth.hhs.gov Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - of Columbia Page 1 of 2 Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia - OMB 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 210 of 296Please respond to the following items: 1.

Innovation in Purchasing Decisions - Requested Narrative Question While there are different ways to define value-based purchasing, its purpose is to identify services, payment arrangements, incentives, and players that can be included in directed strategies using purchasing practices that are aimed at improving the value of health care services. In short, health care value is a function of both cost and quality: Health Care Value = Quality \u00f7 Cost, ( V = Q \u00f7 C ) SAMHSA anticipates that the movement toward value based purchasing will continue as delivery system reforms continue to shape states systems. The identification and replication of such value-based strategies and structures will be important to the development of M/SUD systems and services. There is increased interest in having a better understanding of the evidence that supports the delivery of medical and specialty care including M/SUD services. Over the past several years, SAMHSA has collaborated with CMS, HRSA, SMAs, state M/SUD authorities, legislators, and others regarding the evidence of various mental and substance misuse prevention, treatment, and recovery support services. States and other purchasers are requesting information on evidence-based practices or other procedures that result in better health outcomes for individuals and the general population. While the emphasis on evidence-based practices will continue, there is a need to develop and create new interventions and technologies and in turn, to establish the evidence. SAMHSA supports states' use of the block grants for this purpose. The NQF and the IOM recommend that evidence play a critical role in designing health benefits for individuals enrolled in commercial insurance, Medicaid, and Medicare. To respond to these inquiries and recommendations, SAMHSA has undertaken several activities. SAMHSA's Evidence Based Practices Resource Center assesses the research evaluating an intervention's impact on outcomes and provides information on available resources to facilitate the effective dissemination and implementation of the program. SAMHSA's Evidence-Based Practices Resource Center provides the information & tools needed to incorporate evidence-based practices into communities or clinical settings. SAMHSA reviewed and analyzed the current evidence for a wide range of interventions for individuals with mental illness and substance use disorders, including youth and adults with chronic addiction disorders, adults with SMI, and children and youth with SED. The evidence builds on the evidence and consensus standards that have been developed in many national reports over the last decade or more. These include reports by the Surgeon General,49 The New Freedom Commission on Mental Health,50 the IOM,51 NQF,and the Interdepartmental Serious Mental Illness Coordinating Committee (ISMICC).52. The activity included a systematic assessment of the current research findings for the effectiveness of the services using a strict set of evidentiary standards. This series of assessments was published in \"Psychiatry Online.\"53 SAMHSA and other federal partners, the HHS' Administration for Children and Families, Office for Civil Rights, and CMS, have used this information to sponsor technical expert panels that provide specific recommendations to the M/SUD field regarding what the evidence indicates works and for whom, to identify specific strategies for embedding these practices in provider organizations, and to recommend additional service research. In addition to evidence-based practices, there are also many promising practices in various stages of development. Anecdotal evidence and program data indicate effectiveness for these services. As these practices continue to be evaluated, the evidence is collected to establish their efficacy and to advance the knowledge of the field. SAMHSA's Treatment Improvement Protocol Series (TIPS)54 are best practice guidelines for the SUD treatment. SAMHSA draws on the experience and knowledge of clinical, research, and administrative experts to produce the TIPS, which are distributed to a growing number of facilities and individuals across the country. The audience for the TIPS is expanding beyond public and private SUD treatment facilities as alcohol and other drug disorders are increasingly recognized as a major health problem. SAMHSA's Evidence-Based Practice Knowledge Informing Transformation (KIT)55 was developed to help move the latest information available on effective M/SUD practices into community-based service delivery. States, communities, administrators, practitioners, consumers of mental health care, and their family members can use KIT to design and implement M/SUD practices that work. KIT covers getting started, building the program, training frontline staff, and evaluating the program. The KITs contain information sheets, introductory videos, practice demonstration videos, and training manuals. Each KIT outlines the essential components of the evidence-based practice and provides suggestions collected from those who have successfully implemented them.

There are no additional activities the Department of Behavioral Health would like to highlight at this time. Please indicate areas of technical assistance needed related to this section. Technical Assistance is needed to develop and evaluation plan to assess the impact of the State's purchasing decisions. SAMHSA is interested in whether and how states are using evidence in their purchasing decisions, educating policymakers, or supporting providers to offer high quality services. In addition, SAMHSA is concerned with what additional information is needed by SMHAs and SSAs in their efforts to continue to shape their and other purchasers' decisions regarding M/SUD services. 49 United States Public Health Service Office of the Surgeon General (1999).

Transition to Independence Process (TIP): Provides a framework for conceptualizing and organizing services that are still billable under the traditional Medicaid structures. 2. TIP and Assertive Community Treatment (ACT): The integration of TIP and ACT has proven very successful with TAY. 3. Assertive Community Treatment (ACT): An evidence-based practice that improves outcomes for people with severe mental illness who are most vulnerable to homelessness and hospitalization. 4. Medication Management: Monitoring medications to confirm that the patient is complying with a medication regimen, while also ensuring he or she is avoiding potentially dangerous drug interactions and other complications. 5. Family Supports: Social support from family provides patients with practical help and can buffer the stresses of living with illness. 6. RA1SE and NAVIGATE-like Services: The RAISE Early Treatment Program (ETP) is a research study that compared two (2) different ways of providing treatment for people experiencing the early stages of schizophrenia and related illnesses. Both types of treatment emphasized a comprehensive initial evaluation at the earliest point after symptoms appear.Environmental Factors and Plan 4. Evidence-Based Practices for Early Interventions to Address Early Serious Mental Illness (ESMI) - 10 percent set aside - Required MHBG Narrative Question Much of the mental health treatment and recovery service efforts are focused on the later stages of illness, intervening only when things have reached the level of a crisis. While this kind of treatment is critical, it is also costly in terms of increased financial burdens for public mental health systems, lost economic productivity, and the toll taken on individuals and families. There are growing concerns among consumers and family members that the mental health system needs to do more when people first experience these conditions to prevent long-term adverse consequences. Early intervention* is critical to treating mental illness before it can cause tragic results like serious impairment, unemployment, homelessness, poverty, and suicide. The duration of untreated mental illness, defined as the time interval between the onset of a mental disorder and when an individual gets into treatment, has been a predictor of outcomes across different mental illnesses. Evidence indicates that a prolonged duration of untreated mental illness may be viewed as a negative prognostic factor for those who are diagnosed with mental illness. Earlier treatment and interventions not only reduce acute symptoms, but may also improve long-term prognosis. SAMHSA's working definition of an Early Serious Mental Illness is \"An early serious mental illness or ESMI is a condition that affects an individual regardless of their age and that is a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder of sufficient duration to meet diagnostic criteria specified within DSM-5 (APA, 2013). For a significant portion of the time since the onset of the disturbance, the individual has not achieved or is at risk for not achieving the expected level of interpersonal, academic or occupational functioning. This definition is not intended to include conditions that are attributable to the physiologic effects of a substance use disorder, are attributable to an intellectual/developmental disorder or are attributable to another medical condition. The term ESMI is intended for the initial period of onset.\" States may implement models that have demonstrated efficacy, including the range of services and principles identified by National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) via its Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode (RAISE) initiative. Utilizing these principles, regardless of the amount of investment, and by leveraging funds through inclusion of services reimbursed by Medicaid or private insurance, states should move their system to address the needs of individuals with a first episode of psychosis (FEP). RAISE was a set of NIMH sponsored studies beginning in 2008, focusing on the early identification and provision of evidence-based treatments to persons experiencing FEP. The NIMH RAISE studies, as well as similar early intervention programs tested worldwide, consist of multiple evidence-based treatment components used in tandem as part of a Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) model, and have been shown to improve symptoms, reduce relapse, and lead to better outcomes. State shall expend not less than 10 percent of the MHBG amount the State receives for carrying out this section for each fiscal year to support evidence-based programs that address the needs of individuals with early serious mental illness, including psychotic disorders, regardless of the age of the individual at onset. In lieu of expending 10 percent of the amount the State receives under this section for a fiscal year as required a state may elect to expend not less than 20 percent of such amount by the end of such succeeding fiscal year. * MHBG funds cannot be used for primary prevention activities. States cannot use MHBG funds for prodromal symptoms (specific group of symptoms that may precede the onset and diagnosis of a mental illness) and/or those who are not diagnosed with a SMI.

Individual Placement and Support (IPS)/Supported Employment/Education (SEE): This evidence-based program is designed to help people with a psychiatric disorder achieve their vocational and educational goals including people who have had a recent psychosis episode. 8. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Psychosis (CBTp): This is a new evidence-based practice in the District. DBH provided support to Community Connections to arrange an extensive training and supervision package for 20 mental health professionals in the District. The training was provided by the Institute of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Psychosis and occurred over four (4) days. The follow-up supervision is being provided by the four (4) trainers. The supervisors have completed 10 of the contracted 30 sessions. The CBTp introduces the standard CBT principles to a population of people that had not previously benefited from the techniques. Conceptualizing hallucination and delusions as symptoms that are amenable to treatment, CBTp successfully ameliorates some of the most profound symptoms suffered by the clients. 3. How does the state promote the use of evidence-based practices for individuals with ESMI and provide comprehensive individualized treatment or integrated mental and physical health services? DBH is committed to improving the lives of children, youth, transition-age youth, and families through the use of evidence-based practices. DBH contracts with Evidence Based Associates (EBA) to provide training, quality and fidelity reviews, and monitors EBPs. EBA also provides technical support to all District agencies implementing a DBH sponsored EBP. In this collaborative work, EBA and DBH promote the use of evidence-based practices for individuals with ESMI and offers guidance on the crafting of comprehensive individualized treatment plans. There are currently eight (8) EBPs that include the following: 1) Child-Parent Psychotherapy for Family Violence- For ages 0-6 with a history of trauma exposure or maltreatment and their caregivers. 2) Trauma Systems Therapy- For ages 0-19 who have experienced traumatic events and/or who live in environments with ongoing traumatic stress. 3) Parent-Child Interaction Therapy- For ages 2-6 who experience extreme behavioral difficulties with an emphasis on improving the quality of the parent-child relationship and changing parent-child interaction patterns. 4) Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy- For ages 4-18 and helps children, youth, and their parents overcome the negative effects of traumatic life events and address feelings. 5) Multi-Systemic Therapy- For ages 10-17 with emphasis on empowering parents/caregivers effectiveness as they assist the child/youth in successfully making and sustaining changes in individual, family, peer, and school systems. 6) Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach- For ages 12-22 and seeks to replace environmental influences that have supported alcohol or drug use with prosocial activities and behaviors that support recovery. 7) Transition to Independence Process- An evidence-supported model for ages 14-29 that also engages their families and other informal key players in a process that facilitates their movement towards greater self-sufficiency and achievement of their goals. 8) Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Psychosis (CBTp)- An evidence-based treatment primarily designed to target psychotic symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations that persist despite appropriate treatment with antipsychotic medication. 4. Does the state coordinate across public and private sector entities to coordinate treatment and recovery supports for those with ESMI? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No 5. Does the state collect data specifically related to ESMI? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No 6. Does the state provide trainings to increase capacity of providers to deliver interventions related to ESMI? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No 7.

Describe how the state engages consumers and their caregivers in making health care decisions, and enhance communication. Following a comprehensive diagnostic assessment, results are reviewed with the consumer to ensure that there is a shared and agreed-upon understanding of the issues to address in treatment. Based on this shared understanding, the treatment planning process begins by orienting the individual and his/her natural supporters to the process. This process increases the likelihood that the consumer actively participates in all stages of plan development and implementation. Before the process of developing a treatment plan begins, the treatment team lead will encourage pre-planning activities and goal prioritization with the consumer. This step allows the consumer to not only prepare for their planning meeting but to empower them to be voice their choice of how they would like for their recovery to look with the treatment team.

Describe the person-centered planning process in your state. The following activities/areas warrant special attention in the person-centered planning process: 1. Conducting a comprehensive, strengths-based assessment; 2. Developing an interpretive summary as a result of the assessment; 3. Reviewing and considering cultural concerns and preferences in planning and goal development; 4. Orienting individuals and their natural supporters regarding the purpose and process of person-centered planning; and 5. Empowering the individual to identify their hopes and dreams (goals), strengths and barriers to goal accomplishment and then partnering in the development of short-term objectives and interventions that overcome barriers and support individual recovery and resilience. A comprehensive person-centered initiative launched in 2015 that included multiple components: an advisory workgroup made up of consumer, providers and DBH employees; the development of person-centered treatment planning practice guidelines; and the launch of a system-wide person-centered treatment planning training, including a Training-of-Trainer component to ensure sustainability throughout the system. This year, DBH is also developing person-centered assessment practice guidelines and training to support high-quality assessments.

Person Centered Planning (PCP) - Required MHBG Narrative Question States must engage adults with a serious mental illness or children with a serious emotional disturbance and their caregivers where appropriate in making health care decisions, including activities that enhance communication among individuals, families, caregivers, and treatment providers. Person-centered planning is a process through which individuals develop their plan of service. The PCP may include a representative who the person has freely chosen, and/or who is authorized to make personal or health decisions for the person. The PCP team may include family members, legal guardians, friends, caregivers and others that the person or his/her representative wishes to include. The PCP should involve the person receiving services and supports to the maximum extent possible, even if the person has a legal representative. The PCP approach identifies the person?s strengths, goals, preferences, needs and desired outcome. The role of state and agency workers (for example, options counselors, support brokers, social workers, peer support workers, and others) in the PCP process is to enable and assist people to identify and access a unique mix of paid and unpaid services to meet their needs and provide support during planning. The person?s goals and preferences in areas such as recreation, transportation, friendships, therapies, home, employment, education, family relationships, and treatments are part of a written plan that is consistent with the person?s needs and desires.

Mental Health Block Grant (MHBG) Funding Award Process: The Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) and Request for Applications (RFA) have traditionally addressed the statutory restrictions on the use of the MHBG funds. This information is also included in the Pre-Application Conference along with program, performance and fiscal expectations. Mental Health Block Grant (MHBG) Sub-Grant Agreement: The MHBG Sub-Grant Agreement provides detail information about what is required and includes but is not limited to: 1) terms of the agreement, 2) background and purpose, 3) award period, 4) grant administrator, 5) scope and use of funds, 6) grant amount, 7) administrative requirements, 8) reporting requirements, and 9) fund disbursement plan and requirements. Accountability Administration: In FY 20, the Accountability Administration will oversee provider certification; mental health community residence facility licensure; Medicaid claims audits; program integrity; quality improvement; incident management; major investigations; and compliance monitoring. The Administration components are described below. Division of Program Integrity- conducts claims audits, investigations of potential false claiming, monitors provider compliance with DBH regulations and policies, and issues and monitors Corrective Action Plans for providers needing to remediate issues related Environmental Factors and Plan 6. Program Integrity - Required Narrative Question SAMHSA has placed a strong emphasis on ensuring that block grant funds are expended in a manner consistent with the statutory and regulatory framework. This requires that SAMHSA and the states have a strong approach to assuring program integrity. Currently, the primary goals of SAMHSA program integrity efforts are to promote the proper expenditure of block grant funds, improve block grant program compliance nationally, and demonstrate the effective use of block grant funds. While some states have indicated an interest in using block grant funds for individual co-pays deductibles and other types of co-insurance for M/SUD services, SAMHSA reminds states of restrictions on the use of block grant funds outlined in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300x-5 and 300x-31, including cash payments to intended recipients of health services and providing financial assistance to any entity other than a public or nonprofit private entity. Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300x-55(g), SAMHSA periodically conducts site visits to MHBG and SABG grantees to evaluate program and fiscal management. States will need to develop specific policies and procedures for assuring compliance with the funding requirements. Since MHBG funds can only be used for authorized services made available to adults with SMI and children with SED and SABG funds can only be used for individuals with or at risk for SUD. SAMHSA guidance on the use of block grant funding for co-pays, deductibles, and premiums can be found at: http://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/grants/guidance-for-block-grant-funds-for-cost-sharing-assistance-for-private-health- insurance.pdf . States are encouraged to review the guidance and request any needed technical assistance to assure the appropriate use of such funds. The MHBG and SABG resources are to be used to support, not supplant, services that will be covered through the private and public insurance. In addition, SAMHSA will work with CMS and states to identify strategies for sharing data, protocols, and information to assist our program integrity efforts. Data collection, analysis, and reporting will help to ensure that MHBG and SABG funds are allocated to support evidence-based, culturally competent programs, substance use disorder prevention, treatment and recovery programs, and activities for adults with SMI and children with SED. States traditionally have employed a variety of strategies to procure and pay for M/SUD services funded by the MHBG and SABG. State systems for procurement, contract management, financial reporting, and audit vary significantly. These strategies may include: (1) appropriately directing complaints and appeals requests to ensure that QHPs and Medicaid programs are including essential health benefits (EHBs) as per the state benchmark plan; (2) ensuring that individuals are aware of the covered M/SUD benefits; (3) ensuring that consumers of M/SUD services have full confidence in the confidentiality of their medical information; and (4) monitoring the use of M/SUD benefits in light of utilization review, medical necessity, etc. Consequently, states may have to become more proactive in ensuring that state-funded providers are enrolled in the Medicaid program and have the ability to determine if clients are enrolled or eligible to enroll in Medicaid. Additionally, compliance review and audit protocols may need to be revised to provide for increased tests of client eligibility and enrollment.

Tribes - Requested Narrative Question The federal government has a unique obligation to help improve the health of American Indians and Alaska Natives through the various health and human services programs administered by HHS. Treaties, federal legislation, regulations, executive orders, and Presidential memoranda support and define the relationship of the federal government with federally recognized tribes, which is derived from the political and legal relationship that Indian tribes have with the federal government and is not based upon race. SAMHSA is required by the 2009 Memorandum on Tribal Consultation56 to submit plans on how it will engage in regular and meaningful consultation and collaboration with tribal officials in the development of federal policies that have tribal implications. Improving the health and well-being of tribal nations is contingent upon understanding their specific needs. Tribal consultation is an essential tool in achieving that understanding. Consultation is an enhanced form of communication, which emphasizes trust, respect, and shared responsibility. It is an open and free exchange of information and opinion among parties, which leads to mutual understanding and comprehension. Consultation is integral to a deliberative process that results in effective collaboration and informed decision-making with the ultimate goal of reaching consensus on issues. In the context of the block grant funds awarded to tribes, SAMHSA views consultation as a government-to-government interaction and should be distinguished from input provided by individual tribal members or services provided for tribal members whether on or off tribal lands. Therefore, the interaction should be attended by elected officials of the tribe or their designees and by the highest possible state officials. As states administer health and human services programs that are supported with federal funding, it is imperative that they consult with tribes to ensure the programs meet the needs of the tribes in the state. In addition to general stakeholder consultation, states should establish, implement, and document a process for consultation with the federally recognized tribal governments located within or governing tribal lands within their borders to solicit their input during the block grant planning process. Evidence that these actions have been performed by the state should be reflected throughout the state?s plan. Additionally, it is important to note that approximately 70 percent of American Indians and Alaska Natives do not live on tribal lands. The SMHAs, SSAs and tribes should collaborate to ensure access and culturally competent care for all American Indians and Alaska Natives in the states. States shall not require any tribe to waive its sovereign immunity in order to receive funds or for services to be provided for tribal members on tribal lands. If a state does not have any federally recognized tribal governments or tribal lands within its borders, the state should make a declarative statement to that effect. 56 Page 1 of 1 Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia - OMB 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 220 of 296Please respond to the following items 1.

Primary Prevention - Required SABG Narrative Question SABG statute requires states to spend not less than 20 percent of their SABG allotment on primary prevention strategies directed at individuals not identified to be in need of treatment. While primary prevention set-aside funds must be used to fund strategies that have a positive impact on the prevention of substance use, it is important to note that many evidence-based substance use disorder prevention strategies also have a positive impact on other health and social outcomes such as education, juvenile justice involvement, violence prevention, and mental health. The SABG statute requires states to develop a comprehensive primary prevention program that includes activities and services provided in a variety of settings. The program must target both the general population and sub-groups that are at high risk for substance misuse. The program must include, but is not limited to, the following strategies: 1.Information Dissemination providing awareness and knowledge of the nature, extent, and effects of alcohol, tobacco, and drug use, abuse, and addiction on individuals families and communities; 2.Education aimed at affecting critical life and social skills, such as decision making, refusal skills, critical analysis, and systematic judgment abilities; 3.Alternative programs that provide for the participation of target populations in activities that exclude alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use; 4.Problem Identification and referral that aims at identification of those who have indulged in illegal/age inappropriate use of tobacco or alcohol, and those individuals who have indulged in first use of illicit drugs, in order to assess if the behavior can be reversed by education to prevent further use; 5.Community-based Process that include organizing, planning, and enhancing effectiveness of program, policy, and practice implementation, interagency collaboration, coalition building, and networking; and 6.Environmental Strategies that establish or change written and unwritten community standards, codes, and attitudes, thereby influencing incidence and prevalence of the abuse of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs used in the general population.

Information on synthetic drugs was also included on the Prevention website to provide additional coverage. In FY2018, SABG Prevention Set-Aside resources continued to expand the DBH Prevention Website operations and made updates as needed. The DBH Community Engagement Branch Manager will continue to serve as the lead for information dissemination along with a team of other individuals supported by the SABG. The goal is to disseminate targeted prevention messages and resources to DC youth and adults via the four DC Prevention Centers (DCPCs), website, digital engagement, social media events, and other communication channels. Digital measures are to 1) increase the reach of synthetic drug, underage marijuana use, and underage drinking prevention messages by 20%, segment by local and acquisition channel; 2) increase the level of primary and target audiences by 1-2% each month; 3) maintain steady engagement with youth influencers (parents/caregivers, other adults); and 4) maintain steady engagement with youth. DBH prevention staff will collaborate with DC Prevention Centers (DCPC) to: \u00b7 Update drug facts each month using the best evidence from SAMHSA, NIDA, NIAAA, and ONDCP; \u00b7 Update new information and calendar/event notices from District, Ward, and community leaders;Narratve Question SABG statute requires states to spend not less than 20 percent of their SABG allotment on primary prevention strategies directed at individuals not identified to be in need of treatment.

Educational strategies included: \u00b7 Sponsoring training and technical assistance on the DBH prevention conceptual and operational framework (cultural humility, risk, and protective factors Institute of Medicine Classification System, and the Strategic Prevention Framework five-step planning process). \u00b7 Developing data-driven logic models with culturally appropriate evidence-based preventive interventions for use in SPF planning. \u00b7 Using District and ward data and community conversation findings to make policy, program, and resource decisions. \u00b7 Supporting the development of the prevention workforce through another wave of IC&RC Prevention Specialist training and testing for certification. \u00b7 Training and technical assistance tailored to effective prevention approaches in working with selective and indicated populations. \u00b7 Training and technical assistance in using the online DIRS system for submitting and monitoring monthly prevention program grant reports. \u00b7 Increasing awareness and educating District and ward stakeholders on priority drug issues (underage drinking, underage marijuana use, synthetic drug use, and Initiative 71 laws). The next two years, SABG funds will support the development of a more comprehensive and sustainable education strategy that builds needed workforce skills through structured learning processes. The priority audiences are: 1) DBH prevention staff; 2) DC Prevention Centers that reach and educate more than 35,000 community stakeholders annually; 3) key community leaders who work with the DC Prevention Centers; 4) other DBH substance use prevention sub-recipients; and 5) targeted District agency partners that are addressing risk and protective factors for anxiety and depression, violence, delinquency, and poor school performance. Focused education strategies are to; and \u00b7 Develop a policy, program, and business plan to implement the DC Prevention Leadership Center that supports education and technical assistance for an expanded prevention workforce. DBH prevention staff and the DCPCs will continue to support educational events based on identified substance use prevention need; in high need communities with low capacity; and with populations that have documented disparities. Also, to increase opportunities to implement education strategies, the District is preparing to expand its use of evidence- based curricula (Too Good for Drugs) to be implemented within additional schools throughout the District. These curricula aim to raise awareness around the health risks associated with substance use. The District's Substance Use Prevention team will work with school-based clinicians to identify the best method for school engagement whether with universal populations such as within the classroom or among selective and indicated populations that have been referred to the program. c) Alternatives: Alternative strategies will continue to be supported at the District level through DBH prevention staff and DCPCs at the Ward level. These activities coincide with the Marion S. Barry Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP), a locally funded initiative sponsored by the Department of Employment Services that provides District youth ages 14 to 21 with enriching and constructive summer work experiences through subsidized placements in the private and government sectors. In 2015 SYEP expanded the program to include youth ages 22-24 years old. Since that change, the SUD Prevention Branch has sought to engage SYEP youth with more challenging tasks such as the planning and execution of prevention-related activities. Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia Page 6 of 11 Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia - OMB 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 226 of 296To be more intentional in planning and supporting alternative activities, DBH prevention will continue planning fun engagement events to creating a fun atmosphere for communities within the District that are at the highest risk for substance use and other anti-social activities. The team launched its \"pop-up\" events officially in FFY2019. To support these efforts, the DBH prevention team will work with District agency partners and DCPCs year-round. DBH will be pro-active in planning structured alternative strategies across the 8 Wards with the following partners: \u00b7 DBH DOES SYEP program planners \u00b7 DC Parks and Recreation and Roving Leaders Program \u00b7 After school activities \u00b7 DCPC Community Prevention Networks Alternative activities will focus on increasing awareness of prevention and substance use disorder resources, risks of underage alcohol and marijuana use, ward-level data that lead to structured alternates at high-risk times (e.g., summer months, holidays, school breaks, after school). This approach will be data-driven, pro-active opposed to reactive requests, provide consistency across Wards, and have the potential for evaluation. d) Problem Identification and Referral: While the District has documented positive changes in some DC EOW data, the age of first use among middle school youth (cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana) remains on average age 10. For DC high school youth, the average age is 13. There is also a decline in the number of youth assessed and treated through the four youth substance use disorders treatment programs, while behavioral health needs of transitional-age youth continue to increase. The most recent DBH Performance Plan includes substance use disorder objectives for prevention, treatment, and recovery. The first objective, \"Reduce priority risk factors that place District children, youth and families, and communities at risk for substance use and interrelated problems,\" will help focus DBH efforts toward earlier problem identification and referral to services. SPF SIG funds allowed DBH and DCPC to assess 500 individuals, community-based organizations, youth and parents/caregivers on challenges related to early risk reduction that results in delayed problem identification. One challenge is that consumers are not aware of how to fully access behavioral health services due to the merger of mental health and substance use disorders. Other FY 2020 plans include: \u00b7 A public education campaign through treatment funds to increase consumer awareness of DBH system services; \u00b7 Broader awareness of the 24-hour DBH Access HelpLine that provides immediate information and assistance for prevention, treatment, and recovery behavioral health services; and \u00b7 Building upon the youth summit that took place in FY2019 to provide the supports for youth necessarily to increase protective factors and reduce risk factors associated with substance use. e) Community-Based Processes: DBH will continue to allocate SABG prevention set-aside funds for four DC Prevention Centers, dynamic hubs that engage, support, and help connect the many community elements needed for promoting healthy drug-free youth. Each Center serves two Wards each (Wards 1 and 2; Wards 3 and 4; Wards 5 and 6; Wards 7 and 8). Through their grants, DCPC focus on three core functions: 1) community education; 2) community leadership; 3) community changes. These functions provide a consistent strategy but have the flexibility to address the unique characteristics and priorities of the geographic area and populations in their designated Wards. Flexibility in this community prevention system allows partnerships across Ward boundaries to address shared and emergent substance use problems. The Substance use prevention team will begin revisiting the activities included under community-based processes to ensure that the activities and requirements remain in alignment with the needs of the District and mission and vision of the DC Department of Behavioral Health (DBH). The FY 2020 scope of work will include the following requirements: Administrative Leadership: \u00b7 Ensure staffing patterns that include one full-time Project Director/Coordinator and one Community Mobilizer FTE's that share responsibilities for the three core functions. \u00b7 Attend DBH required roundtables, technical assistance, and training. \u00b7 Submit and revise as needed monthly program reports through the online Data Infrastructure Reporting System. \u00b7 Submit quarterly financial reports and revise as needed. \u00b7 Participate in at least one DCPC grant site visit in cooperation with DBH. \u00b7 Attend the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Directors Prevention Research Conference and the SAMHSA Prevention Day. DCPC funds to attend other conferences require written permission from DBH. \u00b7 Allocate a maximum of 10% of the grant funds for indirect or overhead costs. Community Education: This function is designed to provide current, comprehensive, and relevant information for a wide range of audiences within the Prevention Center's respective geographic areas. \u00b7 Market as a DCPC using DBH provided templates (logo, business cards, letterheads, etc.) \u00b7 Provide an \"early warning system,\" track and recommend actions to address new drug trends within the two Wards. \u00b7 Disseminate science-based substance abuse prevention education materials within two Wards. \u00b7 Coordinate and support District and National campaigns (e.g., SAMHSA Week, \"Talk. They Hear You.\", Synthetic Drug Campaign, and the Underage Marijuana Campaign). \u00b7 Use the Community Conversation Guidance document for implementing Community Conversations and submit findings Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia Page 7 of 11 Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia - OMB 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 227 of 296and recommendations in the monthly program progress report. Community Leadership: This function is designed to identify, engage, and strengthen the capacity of community prevention partnerships to address the areas placing youth at risk for substance use disorders. \u00b7 Strengthen and maintain an accessible database of prevention partners involved in the DCPC scope of work. \u00b7 Strengthen and maintain an accessible database of prevention strategies that are currently being implemented by prevention partners within the two Wards. \u00b7 Identify and support the development of community prevention networks that broaden the reach of DCPC. Community Changes: This function increases opportunities for pro-active prevention action planning around Ward specific DCEOW data and measurable changes in prevention policy, programs, and practices. \u00b7 Use the Strategic DC Strategic Prevention Framework (SPF) to mobilize and facilitate data-driven planning with community prevention networks. \u00b7 Support community prevention networks in the implementation of the SPF logic model and action plan. \u00b7 Document community changes by tracking changes in policies, programs, and practices related to the implementation of the action plan. DCPC SABG scope of work and work plan will continue to target three levels of measurable outcomes: 1) priority risk and protective factors; 2) community changes in policies, programs and practices; and 3) distal or behavioral outcomes. DBH will modify the existing DCPC scopes of work based on DCEOW data and evaluation findings. Within the community-based process strategy, DCPCs will continue to address the spectrum of prevention interventions: universal, selective, and indicated. DIRS program reports collect information on IOM categories and demographics. DBH has built on the DCPC core services for other discretionary grants such as SPF SIG and now the Strategic Prevention Framework Partnership for Success Grant. Each funding source requires a separate grant and grant scope of work. There are also separate DIRS modules for submitting online program grant reports to ensure better that SABG dollars are used to fund primary substance abuse prevention services not funded through other means. f) Environmental: Moving forward, SABG funded DBH prevention staff, and DCPCs will disseminate underage drinking prevention, underage marijuana prevention, synthetic narcotics prevention, and tobacco prevention social marketing materials to increase understanding of District laws about youth and adults. The preventing underage marijuana use social marketing campaign will focus on the laws about the passage of Initiative 71 and the behavioral health risks associated with underage use as this remains to be a need. Also, with the increase in the legal age to purchase tobacco products going from 18 to 21, the prevention staff will continue to engage retailers and District residents about the change in the law. Lastly, SABG funded DBH prevention staff will continue to serve on District task forces such as the Criminal Justice Coordinating Council New Psychoactive Substances Workgroup to identify policy and program environmental changes. 3. Does your state have a process in place to ensure that SABG dollars are used only to fund primary prevention services not funded through other means? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No If yes, please describe The DC Department of Behavioral Health (DBH) allocates the budget per the terms and conditions of the SABG award (e.g., the set -aside requirement for Primary Prevention). In addition, the Primary Prevention set-aside requirement of SABG funds support a four (4) DC Prevention Centers at approximately $240,000 each ($960,000 total) who serve as prevention hubs within the community and provides coverage for the District's eight (8) wards. Lastly, the Primary Prevention set-aside goes towards supporting five (5) DBH Prevention Services staff.

While primary prevention set-aside funds must be used to fund strategies that have a positive impact on the prevention of substance use, it is important to note that many evidence-based substance use disorder prevention strategies also have a positive impact on other health and social outcomes such as education, juvenile justice involvement, violence prevention, and mental health. The SABG statute requires states to develop a comprehensive primary prevention program that includes activities and services provided in a variety of settings. The program must target both the general population and sub-groups that are at high risk for substance misuse. The program must include, but is not limited to, the following strategies: 1.Information Dissemination providing awareness and knowledge of the nature, extent, and effects of alcohol, tobacco, and drug use, abuse, and addiction on individuals families and communities; 2.Education aimed at affecting critical life and social skills, such as decision making, refusal skills, critical analysis, and systematic judgment abilities; 3.Alternative programs that provide for the participation of target populations in activities that exclude alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use; 4.Problem Identification and referral that aims at identification of those who have indulged in illegal/age inappropriate use of tobacco or alcohol, and those individuals who have indulged in first use of illicit drugs, in order to assess if the behavior can be reversed by education to prevent further use; 5.Community-based Process that include organizing, planning, and enhancing effectiveness of program, policy, and practice implementation, interagency collaboration, coalition building, and networking; and 6.Environmental Strategies that establish or change written and unwritten community standards, codes, and attitudes, thereby influencing incidence and prevalence of the abuse of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs used in the general population. In implementing the comprehensive primary prevention program, states should use a variety of strategies that target populations with different levels of risk, including the IOM classified universal, selective, and indicated strategies.

Describe available services and resources in order to enable individuals with mental illness, including those with co-occuring mental and substance use disorders to function outside of inpatient or residential institutions to the maximum extent of their capabilities. The Clinical Services Administration (CSA) supervises the operation of all clinical programs and sets standards for the provision of clinical care throughout the public behavioral health system, which is system is community based. CSA set the standards for assessments, referrals, and clinical services; forensic services; the comprehensive emergency psychiatric program; and the disaster behavioral health program. The Administration oversees involuntary commitment at community hospitals, and coordinates services that assist individuals transitioning from psychiatric hospitals and nursing homes to community based behavioral health services. The Access HelpLine is the central point for accessing all DBH community-based services, and Behavioral Health Services Division provides same day urgent care; services include, assessments, counseling, medication management and psychiatric evaluations. The Community Services Administration develops, implements and monitors a comprehensive array of prevention, early intervention and community-based behavioral health services and supports for adults, children, youth, and their families that are culturally and linguistically competent, and supports resiliency and recovery. A network of community based mental health and SUD providers deliver a range of treatment services including, crisis services, residential, outpatient treatment, counseling, and community supports. The Consumer and Family Affairs Administration promotes and protects the rights of individuals with behavioral health disorders; encourages and facilitates consumer and client and family leadership of treatment and recovery plans, and ensures consumer and client voice in the development of the behavioral health system. The Administration also promotes consumer and client leadership, manages the peer certification training, and provides expertise on the consumer and client perspective. This Administration is made up of the following teams: Peer Support, Consumer Engagement, Consumer Rights, Quality Improvement and Saint Elizabeths Hospital. It also contracts with a Peer Operated Drop-In Center and in 2017 launched the D.C. Certified Peer Academy. Evidenced Based Practices- DBH implements a number of evidence-based and evidence-supported practices across a variety of settings.

Case management is not one of the nine (9) listed services, but the District offers Community Support in lieu of case management. Community Support services are rehabilitation and environmental supports considered essential to assist the consumer in achieving rehabilitation and recovery goals that focus on building and maintaining a therapeutic relationship with the consumer. These services may include but are not limited to: 1) a variety of interventions; 2) provided by a team of staff that is responsible for an assigned group of consumers, or by staff who are individually responsible for assigned consumers; 3) services provided to children and youth will include coordination with family and significant others and with other systems of care; 4) services can be provided at the MHRS provider site, natural settings or a residential facility with 16 beds or less; 5) providers will have service specific policies and procedures; and 6) qualified practitioners include psychiatrists, psychologists, licensed social workers, advanced practice nurses; registered nurses; licensed practical nurses; licensed professional counselors; social workers with supervision designation; and addiction counselors. 4. Describe activities intended to reduce hospitalizations and hospital stays. Saint Elizabeths Hospital (SEH), the District of Columbia inpatient psychiatric facility, is operated by the Department of Behavioral Health. Saint Elizabeths provides inpatient psychiatric, medical, and psycho-social person-centered treatment to adults to support their recovery and return to the community. The Hospital's goal is to maintain an active treatment program that fosters individual recovery and independence as much as possible. Saint Elizabeths staff has had an Improved Discharge Planning Initiative since FY18. The strategies focus on increasing the effectiveness of post discharge linkages with community-based treatment and support services. The measurement of effective linkages include the Interdisciplinary Recovery Plan (IRP) Observation Audit and the Discharge Plan of Care (DPOC) Audit. The IRP Audit examines if the family and/or Community Support Workers are invited to IRPs, and if there is active discussion about the discharge plan at each IRP. The DPOC Audit addresses whether patients are linked to a Core Service Agency/active treatment post discharge, and to appropriate housing. The goal of this initiative is to assess the impact of in-hospital communication between individuals in care, community partners, and hospital treatment team members on the discharge planning process, in the hopes that this will result in positive impacts/outcomes for individuals in care as they transition from the Hospital back into the community.

The ARC is a walk-in and appointment-based facility which conducts treatment assessments, TB, HIV/HEP-C Testing services, HIV pre and post counseling, linkage and referral to treatment. ARC clinicians conduct Substance Use Disorder (SUD) Assessments and referral to SUD Treatment. In addition, DBH utilizes a Mobile Assessment and Referral Center (MARC) for same day services where they are able to provide the same services as the ARC (conduct TB, HIV/HEP-C testing services, TB and HIV pre and post counseling and referral to treatment such as the TB clinic. Nurse conduct primary health assessment and referral to services as needed. In FY 2018, the DBH system conducted 6,008 unique client assessments, of which 2,460 (41%) identified heroin as the primary drug of abuse, while another 116 (2%) identified other opiates and synthetics as the primary drug of abuse. Taken together, individuals whose primary SUD problem was either heroin or other opiates constituted 43% (n=2,576) of all assessments conducted in the DBH SUD treatment system. For FY2018, 52% of these individuals were between the ages of 50 and 69.5 Individuals using opioids were 70% male (n=1,716) and 89% African American (n=2,293). In addition, 16% reported a housing status of \"homeless\", another 27% reported \"dependent living\", and 56% were living independently. These housing status data serve to further highlight the challenges faced by the District's opioid users as well as by the public SUD system serving them. Medication Assisted Treatment, Program Capacity & Demographics The District's SUD treatment system is partially bifurcated. DBH certifies \"providers\" but does not have jurisdiction over private physicians or physician groups. DBH's treatment and recovery system has 34 certified substance abuse treatment providers. The 34 certified providers operate 61 facilities throughout the city. The District currently has four (4) DBH-certified Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs), three of which have Human Care Agreements with the department. Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs) The three DBH-certified methadone OTPs are located in Wards 2, 3, 6, and 8. They have a cumulative capacity of 1825. DBH has contracts with Good Hope Institute, United Planning Organization (UPO), and Partners in Drug Rehabilitation Counseling (PIDARC) to provide publicly funded methadone MAT. All OTPs provide psychosocial interventions either in-house or on a contract basis, per the terms of their certification and as required by District law. Additionally, the District has over 100 Office-Based Opioid Treatment (OBOT) providers and 75 DC prescribers; however, OBOTs are not certified by DBH and therefore are not counted as \"providers\" above. Good Hope Institute- Ward 8; 1320 Good Hope Road SE, Washington, DC (Capacity: 700) FY2018 public enrollment: 616 UPO- Ward 6: Ave, Washington, DC 20003 (Capacity: 400) FY2018 enrollment: 420 PIDARC- Ward Washington, DC 20037 (Capacity: 725) FY2018 enrollment: 716 Enrollment at the three OTPs accepting public pay clients decreased 9.3% from FY2017 to FY2018, from 1932 clients to 1752 clients. These decreases were driven by a significant reduction at Good Hope (from 720 to 616) and PIDARC (from 841 to 716). Enrollment at UPO continued to decline from previous FY2016 - FY2017 period (from 488 to 420). Enrollment at the three contracted OTPs was 59% male in FY2018. Office-Based Opioid Treatment (OBOTs) there are 77 office-based opioid treatment (OBOT) locations in the District, spread across all 8 Wards (See map). Seven of the OBOT practitioners are also certified by DC Department of Health Care Finance (DHCF) to provide office-based MAT through Medicaid. As indicated on the map, the Medicaid-certified OBOTs are located in Wards 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8. There are currently no OBOTs accepting Medicaid clients in Wards 1, 3, or 4. Detoxification & Hospitals There are 10 hospitals in the District, in Wards 1, 2, 3, 5, & 8. The eight primary hospitals are: Children's National Medical Center (Ward 5) Georgetown Univ. Hospital (Ward 2) George Washington Univ. Hospital (Ward 2) Howard University Hospital (Ward 1) Providence Hospital (Ward 5) Sibley Memorial Hospital (Ward 3) United Medical Center (Ward 8) Wash. Hospital Center (Ward 5) In addition, there are two psychiatric hospitals: Psychiatric Institute of Washington (PIW) (Ward 3) St. Elizabeth's Hospital (Ward 8 and operated by DBH Only Providence and PIW offers detoxification services, however DBH contracts only with PIW, however, DBH is working to expand the Short- term Medically Monitored Intensive Withdrawal Management services in the community. Focusing on the growing number of opioid overdoses, in 2017 DOH continued the Heroin Overdose Taskforce. Each month, key stakeholders within the DC government convene to share information regarding current public health and law enforcement efforts related to heroin and other opioids. The stakeholders include members from DOH, as well as the Department of Behavioral Health (DBH), Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME), Office of the Attorney General (OAG), Department of Forensic Sciences (DFS), Fire and EMS Department Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia Page 10 of 13 Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia - OMB 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 248 of 296(FEMS) and the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). The Heroin Task Force is, hosted monthly by DOH and focuses on collecting and reporting on epidemiological data and information to address issues; identify processes, systems, interventions and collaborations that will support a system-wide approach to addressing opioid use and misuse. Charitable Choice In October of 2002, the District implemented the Drug Treatment Choice Program (DTCP) pursuant to the District of Columbia Choice in Drug Treatment Act of 2000 (D.C. Law 13-146; D.C. Official Code \u00a7 7-3001 et seq.); which allowed the consumer the right to choose the treatment provider that would meet the consumers individual needs. Referrals DBH finalized new certification standards for all substance use disorder (SUD) treatment and recovery providers in September 2015. These new standards are designed to: 1) Increase the standard of care and enhance person-centered treatment given by providers 2) Enforce the utilization of ASAM criteria standards with required treatment services by qualified practitioners 3) Support implementation of reimbursable Medicaid services for eligible individuals 4) Align the certification standards with other DBH programs to effectively link and refer clients to the proper level of treatment adhering to; a. Chapter 63 - ASARS b. Electronic Health Record (DATA/WITS) c. DBH assessment and placement criteria based on the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM), and Treatment and Assessment Protocol assessment tool (TAP) d. Person-Centered Model of care The Districts identified workforce has increased overtime, however with the new Chapter 63 regulatory standards reinforcing the need for qualified practitioners the SUD Provider network is experience several challenges. The Department of Behavioral Health (DBH) oversees a network of 76 certified behavioral health service providers. DBH conducts numerous trainings for ancillary partners such as police and attorneys through the DBH Training Institute. The District and DBH currently have a shortage of licensed mental health and substance use disorder clinicians. With a rapidly growing consumer-bases and city-wide population growth, the District has a relatively low number of licensed clinicians to serve the clients in treatment and recovery. The recent change in the District regulation call for Clinical Care Coordination, a licensed or certified Qualified Practitioner who has the overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the client's treatment plan, is responsible for identification, coordination, and monitoring of non-SUD-treatment clinical services, and is identified in the client's treatment plan. In the Districts efforts to address the whole person from a person centered lens are supported by this enhanced requirement for client's continuity of care needs for both M/SUD services across of the Behavioral Health Network. DBH has developed a no wrong door system of care to ensure that client needs are met and access and referral to treatment is seamless. The Person-centered Cultural diversity strategic framework sets future strategic priorities and directions for in policy and service delivery processes. These polices and services are: integrate cultural and linguistic diversity into planning; monitoring and evaluation n build organizational capacity to work within culturally diverse communities, and provide culturally and linguistically responsive services and programs in behavioral health services. A very important part of this framework is planning for the future of DBH. The training institute has been an intricate part of the implementation of the Person-centered training, .the development of assessment practice standards, and trauma informed care system standards. The District has two formal agreements to improve referral process, thus ensuring individuals are assessed and placed in the appropriate the treatment modality of care based on individual need. Specifically the District is in the process of implementing an electronic system to enhance medical necessity, access and authorization processes for SUD treatment. This effort includes updating the current E.H.R. system, to include a new Recovery module. Patient Records DBH currently maintains consumer health records within an electronic health records (EHR) system, which contains all PHI information for consumers who access the network of providers. DBH requires that all behavioral health records be maintained in a manner that complies with applicable state and Federal (42 CFR Part 2) HIPPA regulations, accreditation standards, professional practice standards, and legal standards. Furthermore, the department provides ongoing training for staff and community partners regarding client confidentiality and requirements, training on responding to requests asking for acknowledgement of the presence of client. On an ongoing basis the Office of the General Council and the Transformation Systems Administration update Departmental regulations, policies and procedures which regulate and control access to records, under current Federal HIPAA laws and policies. Specifically, the Records Management Division,manages the medical records program and maintains official medical records for DBH all consumers and clients; oversees the development, implementation, maintenance of, and adherence to DBH policies and procedures covering the privacy of, and access to, patient health information in compliance with federal and state laws and the provider's information privacy practices. While, the Network Development and Community based Services provide ongoing site technical assistance, workgroups, small committees, workshops and WebEx demonstrations.

The Department's SUD refers DOH's HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis, STD and TB Administration (HAHSTA) needle exchange program in the District as a collaborative effort to develop the continuum of care model to support treatment and recovery. DOH/HAHSTA's policies and procedures have been developed for use by approved needle exchange programs (NEX) as guidelines for People Who Inject Drugs (PWID). Development and implementation of these policies and procedures provides direction to organizations engaged in hypodermic needle and syringe exchange in the District, and supports compliance with regulations governing the operation of such programs. Naloxone-Related Efforts Naloxone is administered in the community and through DC Fire and EMS Department (FEMS). Currently, the District's community naloxone distribution system is handled primarily by DOH. DOH has also worked with DHCF to ensure open prescription for naloxone (removing prior authorization) under both fee-for-service Medicaid and all three of the District's Medicaid Managed Care Organizations (MCOs). DBH's prevention branch is beginning to work much more closely with DOH, given the importance of naloxone in avoiding fatal opioid overdoses. Community-Level Naloxone Efforts In an effort to curb the number of deaths due to opioid overdoses, HAHSTA established a Naloxone Pilot Program in late FY16. Partner agencies distribute Naloxone to bystanders and other community members in particular \"hotspots\" or areas where overdoses have frequently occurred. Naloxone is an FDA- approved medication that temporarily reverses the effects of opioids such as heroin, methadone and morphine. It can be administered via various intraosseously, intrasmuscularly, and intranasally. The DOH procures Narcan for its partner agencies, Family and Medical Counseling Service (FMCS) and HIPS, as it can be easily administered by laypersons intranasally. It works relatively quickly, is painless, requires no assembly, contains pre-measured dose (reduces medication dosing errors), and avoids the use of needles. In FY18, HAHSTA expended approximately $235,000 in the purchasing of 3,133 Narcan kits for distribution in the community. HAHSTA provided 4,005 Narcan kits to both partner agencies (a sum of Narcan kits were ordered and remaining from late FY '17) of which 3,902 were distributed, and over 3,100 clients were served. Partner agencies reported 734 overdoses where narcan was administered and approximately 85% (N=625) were successfully reversed during FY18. In terms of training District residents on identifying overdoses and administering naloxone, DC Health held 10 trainings and trained 172 unique individuals in FY 18. HAHSTA has seen an increase in demand for Narcan kits to date in FY19 from multiple governmental and community-based agencies. Five additional community and governmental agencies were added to HAHSTA's portfolio of Naloxone providers in FY 2019. With increased funding from the DC DBH in FY 2019, HAHSTA significantly enhanced its distribution efforts, with 21,735 Narcan kits circulating the community. In the first quarter of FY 19, community-based organizations reported a total of 86 overdoses where narcan had been administered and 83 successful reversals (97%).Group Homes Professional Development Through the Training Institute Division and the collaborative efforts from each administration, District wide trainings are offered on an on- going basis. The administrations collaborate to discuss information regarding formularies of evidence based practices, recommend trainings, provide technical assistance/guidance, and construct policy according to best practices for substance abuse standards. The Department requires the use of EBP's to support the delivery of substance use disorder prevention and treatment services. DBH has implemented training opportunities to support the development, improvement and sustainability of methods related to evidence-based practices. Under ASARS, Chapter 63 regulations all Substance Abuse treatment and recovery programs are required to be certified through DBH's Certification Division under the Accountability Administration, including private, non-contracted substance abuse treatment and recovery programs. EBP's, governed by Chapter 63, are required by the Department in accordance with the regulations. Implementation of EBP's are reinforced through both education opportunities for providers, as well as the service review process implemented by the Accountability Administration. All EBP's qualifying of Medicaid funding are required to be registered or approved by SAMHSA's National Registry of Evidence-based Programs and Practices (NREPP). Regulatory standards need to be met as reporting requirements for DBH certification standards. The Systems Transformation Administration is responsible for ensuring there is an EHR in place to collect the data and report TEDS/NOMS. While, DBH's Training Institute Division provides a comprehensive list of trainings in accordance with recommendations and needs to address new/emerging trends. The Department has developed and implemented additional trainings and workshops designed to increase employee understanding of recovery support services. The Department contracted with a vendor to develop a curriculum for which providers, staff and MH/SUD peers could participate. Trainings have been and will continue to be established to address state office staff across departments and divisions. The goal is to increase staff knowledge of develop innovative programs and initiatives to support the delivery of quality services. Trainings implemented to date supports integration efforts, between internal, co-located and external staff under M/SUD. The \"Executive Dashboard,\" (a daily data report which summarizes key critical agency data points), will beis accessible daily for Department staff, particularly management to review.

Has your state modified its CQI plan from FFY 2018-FFY 2019? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No Please indicate areas of technical assistance needed related to this section. The Department of Behavioral Health (DBH) has adopted a quality management process, Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI), to address the need for improving the quality behavioral health services District-wide. The Department has developed and continues to revamp a process for developing a structured approach for identifying gaps and analyzing and improving service delivery, including through the use of a quality electronic health record (EHR) system. The Department uses the DATA-WITs system, an open -source practice management system, to help the agency to capture data efficiently and effectively. Several internal and external workgroups provide data-driven reports that inform the continuous quality improvement process (CQI). DBH's CQI process also promotes and encourages a Total Quality Management (TQM) environment. The TQM philosophy supports the development of strategies and techniques, which assist in the exploration of how the department can and will continue restructuring an integrative behavioral system, city-wide. These efforts will further inform how the Department will continue promoting growth and sustainability, build partnerships, and meaningful collaborations with community agencies. Application of data-driven decisions will further enable the agency to thrive in a changing healthcare environment and provide personal job satisfaction for internal and external staff by allowing for their input, creativity, and efficiency in the work that they do. Primarily Quality Improvement (QI) activities reside within the DBH Accountability Administration (AA), Program Integrity Division, which includes both the Accountability Branch and the Community Services Review Branch, and the Systems Transformation Administration, which includes the Data and Performance Management (DPM) Division. The Data and Performance Management Division works with DBH departments, both those that provide clinical services directly and those that liaise with contracted providers, to ensure data quality and performance improvement on priority metrics. DPM creates dashboards that give leadership access to meaningful information that allows for data-driven decisions to be made. DPM is implementing a project management process that will ensure key initiatives are carried out. The Information Technology team provides and maintains high-quality hardware and software applications that support the provision and monitoring of consumer and client services. In terms of capturing data for the substance use services, the Department uses the system DATA-WITS, which supports DBH in the development and production of data to inform the decision- making process. The DBH Accountability Branch is responsible for performing continuous reviews of provider service delivery in multiple ways. The branch performs a yearly claims audit that is used to assess whether services are being delivered according to regulation and policy promulgated by DBH. While this is largely a compliance review, the data collected is also important for CQI activities. For instance, audits often determine that a given agency or agencies are not performing timely assessments or treatment planning. DBH issues Corrective Action Plans based on audit results that direct providers to address these issues. DBH works closely with providers to ensure the delivery of quality services to their consumers. As part of that effort, DBH assesses community behavioral health best practices and compliance with DBH policy requirements within our system. These data sources allow DBH to assess provider performance. Program Integrity also holds quarterly Quality Council meetings that include all providers as participants. These meetings allow providers to communicate concerns about quality issues affecting the system, as well as for DBH to inform providers of issues of which they should be aware.Environmental Factors and Plan 11. Quality Improvement Plan- Requested Narrative Question In previous block grant applications, SAMHSA asked states to base their administrative operations and service delivery on principles of Continuous Quality Improvement/Total Quality Management (CQI/TQM). These CQI processes should identify and track critical outcomes and performance measures, based on valid and reliable data, consistent with the NBHQF, which will describe the health and functioning of the mental health and addiction systems. The CQI processes should continuously measure the effectiveness of services and supports and ensure that they continue to reflect this evidence of effectiveness. The state's CQI process should also track programmatic improvements using stakeholder input, including the general population and individuals in treatment and recovery and their families. In addition, the CQI plan should include a description of the process for responding to emergencies, critical incidents, complaints, and grievances.

Does the state have a plan or policy for M/SUD providers that guide how they will address individuals with trauma-related issues? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No 2. Does the state provide information on trauma-specific assessment tools and interventions for M/SUD providers? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No 3. Does the state have a plan to build the capacity of M/SUD providers and organizations to implement a trauma-informed approach to care? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No 4. Does the state encourage employment of peers with lived experience of trauma in developing trauma- informed organizations? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No 5. Does the state have any activities related to this section that you would like to highlight. As part of the screening and assessment process with DBH, whether through the agency's primary assessment site ( the DBH- Assessment and Referral Center (ARC)), the contracted court system assessment center, the contracted detox service providers, the Department of Corrections' (DOC) assessment office, or the HIV-EIS contracted provider, under the auspices of a local Federally Qualified Healthcare Center (FQHC), there is a thorough biopsychosocial assessment conducted on each individual entering our system. This process consists of a GAIN SS for adults, which supports the identification of severity of need for further substance use or mental health challenge assessment. If the need for a more comprehensive assessment is identified, consumers are then assessed using the Treatment Assessment Protocol (TAP), which is a combination of the American Society of Addictions Medicine Environmental Factors and Plan 12. Trauma - Requested Narrative Question Trauma 57 is a widespread, harmful, and costly public health problem. It occurs because of violence, abuse, neglect, loss, disaster, war and other emotionally harmful and/or life threatening experiences. Trauma has no boundaries with regard to age, gender, socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, geography, or sexual orientation. It is an almost universal experience of people with mental and substance use difficulties. The need to address trauma is increasingly viewed as an important component of effective M/SUD service delivery. Additionally, it has become evident that addressing trauma requires a multi-pronged, multi-agency public health approach inclusive of public education and awareness, prevention and early identification, and effective trauma-specific assessment and treatment. To maximize the impact of these efforts, they need to be provided in an organizational or community context that is trauma-informed. Individuals with experiences of trauma are found in multiple service sectors, not just in M/SUD services. People in the juvenile and criminal justice system have high rates of mental illness and substance use disorders and personal histories of trauma. Children and families in the child welfare system similarly experience high rates of trauma and associated M/SUD problems. Many patients in primary, specialty, emergency and rehabilitative health care similarly have significant trauma histories, which has an impact on their health and their responsiveness to health interventions. Schools are now recognizing that the impact of exposure to trauma and violence among their students makes it difficult to learn and meet academic goals. Communities and neighborhoods experience trauma and violence. For some these are rare events and for others these are daily events that children and families are forced to live with. These children and families remain especially vulnerable to trauma- related problems, often are in resource poor areas, and rarely seek or receive M/SUD care. States should work with these communities to identify interventions that best meet the needs of these residents. In addition, the public institutions and service systems that are intended to provide services and supports for individuals are often re- traumatizing, making it necessary to rethink doing ?business as usual.? These public institutions and service settings are increasingly adopting a trauma-informed approach. A trauma-informed approach is distinct from trauma-specific assessments and treatments. Rather, trauma- informed refers to creating an organizational culture or climate that realizes the widespread impact of trauma, recognizes the signs and symptoms of trauma in clients and staff, responds by integrating knowledge about trauma into policies and procedures, and seeks to actively resist re-traumatizing clients and staff. This approach is guided by key principles that promote safety, trustworthiness and transparency, peer support, empowerment, collaboration, and sensitivity to cultural and gender issues. A trauma-informed approach may incorporate trauma- specific screening, assessment, treatment, and recovery practices or refer individuals to these appropriate services. It is suggested that states refer to SAMHSA's guidance for implementing the trauma-informed approach discussed in the Concept of Trauma58 paper. 57 Definition of Trauma: Individual trauma results from an event, series of events, or set of circumstances that is experienced by an individual as physically or emotionally harmful or life threatening and that has lasting adverse effects on the individual's functioning and mental, physical, social, emotional, or spiritual well-being. 58 Ibid Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia Page 1 of 2 Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia - OMB 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 253 of 296Patient Placement Criteria (ASAM-PPC) and the GAIN-I. The TAP includes several trauma assessment questions, which directly correlate to the identified problems and subsequent goals on the individual treatment plan. All individuals receiving District funded substance use treatment services are assessed using the TAP, either at the ARC or one of the two designated detox entry sites into the treatment system. At present, District Providers implement the use of Trauma Recovery and Empowerment Model, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and Cognitive Behavioral Interventions (CBI). Additionally, DBH is reviewing the state regulations for adult substance use services, under Chapter 63 regulations, to include explicit policies to support the use of specific EBP's, including those addressing trauma concerns. All District funded substance use providers are governed by the agency's Title 22A, Chapter 63 Certification Standard, which speaks to the need for providers to coordinate individualized care for the population seeking services, and for providers to ensure that consumers connect to services based on individualized needs identified in their treatment plans. Also, specific policies incorporate the requirement that individuals are placed in the appropriate level of care (modality) and that treatment interventions and techniques which address trauma are included in the individualized treatment plans. DBH provides the provider network with training, which includes Integrated Dual Diagnosis Treatment, Patient-Centered Training, and other treatment-related trainings to support trauma-informed care. The Department has partnered with Child and Family Services (CFSA) the District's child welfare agency to provide trauma-informed care training to the adolescent substance abuse providers. The DC CFSA is in their last year of a five-year federal grant, which was designed to establish and strengthen trauma-informed care as the foundation of serving children and youth in the District's child welfare system. In collaboration with other youth-serving community agencies, CFSA chose the Trauma Systems Therapy (TST) Model. The TST model focuses on (1) a traumatized child or youth who cannot regulate his/her emotional state and (2) a social environment/system of care that cannot help contain this regulation. National data shows that identified adverse childhood experiences (ACE) have had a negative impact, on youth and adults, with approximately 70 percent of the population having documented ACE experiences. The Department's Office of Prevention is focusing the DC Epidemiological Outcomes Workgroup on collecting and analyzing ACE data to identify early childhood risk and protective factors that can be used to target early preventive interventions. DCEOW representatives include a cross-cutting team of District leaders from the Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration, Child and Family Services Administration, Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services, Metropolitan Police Department, Office of the State Superintendent of Education, Department of Health, and the Children and Youth Investment Trust Corporation. This work will set the stage for a renewed look at the risk and protective factor mode, especially in urban areas and culturally diverse populations. As the developers of the Social Immunization Approach to Public Health and Substance Abuse stated in an editorial published in the Journal of the National Medical Association Overall data on illicit drug use hides the fact that residents of some communities are at higher risk than those living elsewhere. For example, we know there is a substantially higher prevalence of illicit drug use among inner-city residents than among those who reside in suburban or rural areas. These high-risk communities must be explicitly identified to receive priority consideration for drug control resources. The editorial also supported an analysis of epidemiological and census data the zip code level in order to clearly identify affected areas. While ACE is generally considered a tool to assess individual adult trauma, DBH is focusing prevention efforts on universal, selective and indicated strategies that prevent and reduce the effects of trauma in stressful and high risk community environments. Please indicate areas of technical assistance needed related to this section. Technical Assistance is needed to educate providers on providing services in a trauma informed system of care. DBH Network Development Division will provide ongoing TA to support the implementation of SAMHSA's guidelines after the training.

Does the state provide cross-trainings for M/SUD providers and criminal/juvenile justice personnel to increase capacity for working with individuals with M/SUD issues involved in the justice system? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No 4. Does the state have an inter-agency coordinating committee or advisory board that addresses criminal and juvenile justice issues and that includes the SMHA, SSA, and other governmental and non-governmental entities to address M/SUD and other essential domains such as employment, education, and finances? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No 5. Does the state have any activities related to this section that you would like to highlight? While Medicaid cannot be used to pay for an individual's health care services while incarcerated (other than inpatient treatment in a community medical facility), people are eligible for Medicaid while incarcerated and can apply/reapply for Medicaid before release. Therefore, when someone is incarcerated, DC implements a provision to suspend rather than terminate Medicaid coverage. This provision allows DC to reinstate benefits if an individual receives inpatient care at a community medical institution while incarcerated, and facilitates more seamless reinstatement of full benefits when an individual is released back into the community. DBH certifies of 85 providers that treat approximately 35,000 residents for mental health or substance use disorders; eleven providers are dually certified for both SUD and MHRS. DBH ensures that pre-trial providers are competent to assess for both mental health and substance use disorders at the same time, to ensure proper treatment. DBH implements a process that sustains clinical services and maintains an infrastructure within the mental health and substance abuse systems to support integrated pre- trial service delivery. Services provided prior to adjudication and/or sentencing for individuals with mental health and/ or substance use disorders include the following:Environmental Factors and Plan 13. Criminal and Juvenile Justice - Requested Narrative Question More than half of all prison and jail inmates meet criteria for having mental health problems, six in ten meet criteria for a substance use problem, and more than one-third meet criteria for having co-occurring mental and substance use problems. Youth in the juvenile justice system often display a variety of high-risk characteristics that include inadequate family support, school failure, negative peer associations, and insufficient use of community-based services. Most adjudicated youth released from secure detention do not have community follow-up or supervision; therefore, risk factors remain unaddressed.59 Successful diversion of adults and youth from incarceration or re-entering the community from detention is often dependent on engaging in appropriate M/SUD treatment. Some states have implemented such efforts as mental health, veteran and drug courts, Crisis Intervention Training (CIT) and re-entry programs to help reduce arrests, imprisonment and recidivism.60 A diversion program places youth in an alternative program, rather than processing them in the juvenile justice system. States should place an emphasis on screening, assessment, and services provided prior to adjudication and/or sentencing to divert persons with M/SUD from correctional settings. States should also examine specific barriers such as a lack of identification needed for enrollment Medicaid and/or the Health Insurance Marketplace; loss of eligibility for Medicaid resulting from incarceration; and care coordination for individuals with chronic health conditions, housing instability, and employment challenges. Secure custody rates decline when community agencies are present to advocate for alternatives to detention. The MHBG and SABG may be especially valuable in supporting care coordination to promote pre-adjudication or pre-sentencing diversion, providing care during gaps in enrollment after incarceration, and supporting other efforts related to enrollment. 59 Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency: : Identifying High-Risk Youth: Prevalence and Patterns of Adolescent Drug Victims, Judges, and Juvenile Court Reform Through Restorative Justice.

Mental health disorders A positive result initiates a referral for a full assessment using the Treatment Assignment Protocol (TAP). TAP provides a person with the appropriate assessment for placement into substance abuse treatment. Many Courts will rely on DBH's assessment, which can be incorporated into a court order or probation requirement. With client consent, we release the assessment and drug screens to the court, along with the appropriate referral information. Court Urgent Care Clinic (CUCC): Individuals receive immediate access to mental health services in the courthouse. CUCC provides screenings and mental health assessments for the Pre-trial Services Agency (PSA). PSA recommends release conditions and makes referrals for mental health services to DBH, contacts CSAs for mental health information, and screens candidates for the Options Program. Individuals who are not currently linked to a CSA and have a history of non-compliance with court dates are referred to the Options Program. Competency Assessments and Restoration Services: Competency Restoration* occurs on an inpatient or outpatient basis, based upon the profile of the specific need of the client, here in D.C. * Competency restoration is the process used when an individual charged with a crime is found by a court to be incompetent to stand trial, typically due to an active mental illness or an intellectual disability. A criminal defendant must be restored to competency before the legal process can continue. In an effort to serve District residents who have become involved with the criminal justice system, substance abuse system, and/or the mental health system, DBH and other District departments responsible for addressing the criminal justice system, have developed, incorporated and implemented recommendations proposed by the Substance Abuse Treatment and Mental Health Services Integration Taskforce (SATMHSIT, 2009-2015). These policies were designed to improve treatment options available to defendants and ex-offenders. The CUCC specifically implemented the policies to expand their array of services by offering assessments and referrals to substance abuse treatment programs for individuals with substance use disorders. As it relates to juveniles, the Juvenile Behavioral Diversion Program (JBDP) was established as a problem-solving court. To participate in the program, the juvenile or status offender must have an Axis I mental health disorder or be at significant risk of receiving an Axis I diagnosis. The respondent may also have an Axis II developmental disability as long as he or she can participate in the program, but they cannot solely have an Axis II diagnosis. The Program is an intensive non-sanction based program designed to link juveniles and status offenders to, and engage them in, appropriate mental health services and supports in the community to reduce behavioral symptoms that result in contact with the court and to improve the juvenile's functioning in the home, school, and community. DBH's Training Institute provides learning opportunities to employees, consumers, providers, criminal justice partners, and other partners who support mental health services in the District. The Training Institute mission is to continually strengthen the knowledge, technical skills, and the quality of services and supports through the development of a dynamic, culturally and linguistically responsive, performance-based, and data-driven learning environment. All courses offered through the Training Institute address co-occurring competent applications of service delivery. With the assistance of DBH, the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) has trained over 1369 officers from various District-area law enforcement agencies since the program's inception in April 2009. Approximately 125 new Crisis Intervention Officers (CIO) are trained every year, including people from other law enforcement agencies in the District, such as the Capitol Police, Protective Services Division, and the Metropolitan Police. In addition to these specially-trained officers, every MPD officer must receive mental health training to learn appropriate techniques to use when responding to calls-for-service involving mentally ill residents.

Does the state have any activities related to this section that you would like to highlight? DBH certifies four (4) medicated assisted treatment (MAT) providers in the District, three of which DBH contracts to provide methadone, while the fourth non-contracted provider has a primary care physician on-site to prescribes suboxone. All MAT providers serve consumers across the eight (8) Wards, delivering opioid replacement therapy (ORT), and counseling services. During the initial client intake process, located at an ARC location, counselors provide educational materials and guidance on the availability of MAT services in the District. Instructional materials include informing the client about his/her rights and supporting the decision to access services based on individual need. The District continues to develop and implement various marketing tools to educate the community on the use and abuse of opioids and other synthetic drugs. Mediums for communicating information include public services ads (PSA's), handbills, social media, and television and fact sheets. The message targets both access, use, and treatment, such as medication-assisted treatment therapies, related to opioid use. Many of the campaigns focus on a targeted population, to ensure the appropriate message is delivered and received by the audience. Currently, DBH has on-going communications with the provider network, through scheduled monthly provider meetings and or conference calls and monthly meetings specifically for MAT providers. During a planned series of educational outreach efforts, DBH clinical and non-clinical outreach teams, in collaboration with the local Fire and Emergency Services (FEMS), used the Screening, Brief, Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) tool to conduct brief screenings and provide a referral to treatment, including MAT.Environmental Factors and Plan 14. Medication Assisted Treatment - Requested (SABG only) Narrative Question There is a voluminous literature on the efficacy of medication-assisted treatment (MAT); the use of FDA approved medication; counseling; behavioral therapy; and social support services, in the treatment of substance use disorders. However, many treatment programs in the U.S. offer only abstinence-based treatment for these conditions. The evidence base for MAT for SUDs is described in SAMHSA TIPs 40[1], 43[2], 45[3], and 49[4]. SAMHSA strongly encourages that the states require treatment facilities providing clinical care to those with substance use disorders demonstrate that they both have the capacity and staff expertise to use MAT or have collaborative relationships with other providers that can provide the appropriate MAT services clinically needed. Individuals with substance use disorders who have a disorder for which there is an FDA-approved medication treatment should have access to those treatments based upon each individual patient's needs. In addition, SAMHSA also encourages states to require the use of MAT for substance use disorders for opioid use, alcohol use, and tobacco use disorders where clinically appropriate. SAMHSA is asking for input from states to inform SAMHSA's activities.

Under the District Court system in the Court Urgent Care Clinic (CUCC), clinicians test for pregnancy, and if positive, link the client to SUD treatment and primary care for the unborn child and mother. In addition, DBH has co-located a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LICSW) to be the local Mobile Assessor (Social Worker) at the Child and Family Services Administration (CFSA), the District's agency focusing on women's needs for SUD screening and assessment for treatment. Thus, access to SUD treatment for women has increased in that the women can be screened in multiple locations. DBH requires that all certified MAT providers follow the requirements under SAMHSA, DEA and FDA to ensure that approved medications are prescribed and dispensed appropriately. Providers must be certified through the DBH Accountability Administration, which includes submission of all certifications supporting the Providers application for providing MAT and other control medicated assisted treatment therapies used to treat consumers within the MAT network system. DBH was awarded the Opioid State Targeted Response (STR) grant to implement the District Opioid Targeted Strategy (DOTS), which addressed all individuals in the District with, or at risk for, Opioid Use Disorders (OUDs). DOTS specifically targeted middle- aged, \\African-American males using heroin because local data indicated they are most affected. Through the STR Program, 985 clients were served. While no new clients received methadone under the STR grant, 882 clients receiving methadone received STR-funded clinical care coordination (CCC) and peer services directly through their OTP. There have been several notable accomplishments of this program. First, individuals receiving MAT had improved access to primary care. Through December 2018, the STR-funded OBOT conducted 553 well exams, performed 773 EKGs, administered 53 vaccines, conducted 622 TB screenings, provided 176 podiatry care visits, and performed either Hep C testing and/or provided Hep C treatment for 595 clients. Second, in Year 2 of the grant, OTP-based CCCs peers helped 46 individuals who received methadone obtain vital records, 70 obtained food/income benefits (e.g., SNAP), 25 obtained durable medical equipment, 16 obtained health insurance, 12 received utility assistance, 13 obtained a job, 8 obtained permanent housing, 14 obtained temporary housing, 1 obtained a childcare voucher, and 118 received transportation assistance. Third, 58 individuals received the Connecticut Community for Addiction Recovery (CCAR) training, which included a MAT competency module. And lastly, in December 2018, the DC Hospital Association (DCHA) was awarded a sub-grant to implement an Emergency Department (ED) Induction program in the District. The program will use SBIRT-trained peers in four (4) EDs (MedStar Washington Hospital Center, Howard University Hospital, United Medical Center, and George Washington University Hospital) to screen and refer persons entering the ED who are experiencing an overdose or a reversal of an overdose to the hospital physicians for induction. The program has gone live in United Medical Center, MedStar Washington Hospital Center, and Howard University Hospital. The program is in the startup stages at George Washington Hospital and is positioned to implement in two additional District hospitals. Forth, for the adult, Opioid Awareness Campaign creative content was finalized during the summer of 2017 and launched in January of 2018. The campaign consisted primarily of guerilla marketing and printed ads posted in targeted areas throughout Wards, 5 7, and 8. The primary message of the campaign was to encourage the use of Naloxone, especially amongst individuals at higher risk of overdose, while also educating District residents on The Good Samaritan Overdose Amendment Act of 2012. After the campaign was developed, it was tested with OUD consumers at the opioid treatment programs (OTPs) and received controversial feedback on the visuals and messaging. To this end, the no-cost-extension has provided the opportunity to continue decreasing incidences of opioid used disorder through refining a more robust and refreshed prevention media campaign that appeals to a broader audience in collaboration with a local radio station. In September 2018, the District was awarded a State Opioid Response (SOR) grant, known locally as the District of Columbia Opioid Response (DCOR) initiative. Through this grant, the District will build and expand upon the many successes accomplished under the STR grant. Broadly, the DCOR grant is focused on increasing access to medication-assisted treatment (MAT), reducing unmet treatment needs, and reducing opioid overdose-related deaths in DC, through the provision of prevention, treatment, and recovery support services (RSS) to individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). Through this grant, and the city-wide LIVE. LONG. DC. Strategic Plan, the District is building a model with multiple access points to a coordinated network of treatment and RSS providers that will collaborate around the assessment, stabilization, and ongoing treatment of individuals with OUD. *Appropriate use is defined as the use of medication for the treatment of a substance use disorder, combining psychological treatments with approved medications, use of peer supports in the recovery process, safeguards against misuse and diversion of controlled substances used in the treatment of substance use disorders, and advocacy with state payers. *Appropriate use is defined as use of medication for the treatment of a substance use disorder, combining psychological treatments with approved medications, use of peer supports in the recovery process, safeguards against misuse and/or diversion of controlled substances used in treatment of substance use disorders, and advocacy with state payers.

Crisis Services - Requested Narrative Question In the on-going development of efforts to build an robust system of evidence-based care for persons diagnosed with SMI, SED and SUD and their families via a coordinated continuum of treatments, services and supports, growing attention is being paid across the country to how states and local communities identify and effectively respond to, prevent, manage and help individuals, families, and communities recover from M/SUD crises. SAMHSA has recently released a publication, Crisis Services Effectiveness, Cost Effectiveness and Funding Strategies that states may find helpful.61 SAMHSA has taken a leadership role in deepening the understanding of what it means to be in crisis and how to respond to a crisis experienced by people with M/SUD conditions and their families. According to SAMHSA's publication, Practice Guidelines: Core Elements for Responding to Mental Health Crises62, \"Adults, children, and older adults with an SMI or emotional disorder often lead lives characterized by recurrent, significant crises. These crises are not the inevitable consequences of mental disability, but rather represent the combined impact of a host of additional factors, including lack of access to essential services and supports, poverty, unstable housing, coexisting substance use, other health problems, discrimination, and victimization.\" A crisis response system will have the capacity to prevent, recognize, respond, de-escalate, and follow-up from crises across a continuum, from crisis planning, to early stages of support and respite, to crisis stabilization and intervention, to post-crisis follow-up and support for the individual and their family. SAMHSA expects that states will build on the emerging and growing body of evidence for effective community- based crisis-prevention and response systems. Given the multi-system involvement of many individuals with M/SUD issues, the crisis system approach provides the infrastructure to improve care coordination and outcomes, manage costs, and better invest resources. The following are an array of services and supports used to address crisis response. 61http://store.samhsa.gov/product/Crisis-Services-Effective-Cost-Effectiveness-and-Funding-Strategies/SMA14-4848 62Practice Guidelines: Core Elements for Responding to Mental Health Crises.

Does the state support recovery through any of the following: Environmental Factors and Plan 16. Recovery - Required Narrative Question The implementation of recovery supports and services are imperative for providing comprehensive, quality M/SUD care. The expansion in access to and coverage for health care compels SAMHSA to promote the availability, quality, and financing of vital services and support systems that facilitate recovery for individuals. Recovery encompasses the spectrum of individual needs related to those with mental disorders and/or substance use disorders. Recovery is supported through the key components of: health (access to quality health and M/SUD treatment); home (housing with needed supports), purpose (education, employment, and other pursuits); and community (peer, family, and other social supports). The principles of recovery guide the approach to person-centered care that is inclusive of shared decision-making. The continuum of care for these conditions includes psychiatric and psychosocial interventions to address acute episodes or recurrence of symptoms associated with an individual's mental or substance use disorder. Because mental and substance use disorders are chronic conditions, systems and services are necessary to facilitate the initiation, stabilization, and management of long-term recovery. SAMHSA has developed the following working definition of recovery from mental and/or substance use disorders: Recovery is a process of change through which individuals improve their health and wellness, live a self-directed life to the greatest extent possible, and strive to reach their full potential. In addition, SAMHSA identified 10 guiding principles of recovery: Recovery emerges from hope; Recovery is person-driven; Recovery occurs via many pathways; Recovery is holistic; Recovery is supported by peers and allies; Recovery is supported through relationship and social networks; Recovery is culturally-based and influenced; Recovery is supported by addressing trauma; Recovery involves individuals, families, community strengths, and responsibility; Recovery is based on respect. Please see SAMHSA's Working Definition of Recovery from Mental Disorders and Substance Use Disorders. States are strongly encouraged to consider ways to incorporate recovery support services, including peer-delivered services, into their continuum of care. Technical assistance and training on a variety of such services are available through the SAMHSA supported Technical Assistance and Training Centers in each region. SAMHSA strongly encourages states to take proactive steps to implement recovery support services. To accomplish this goal and support the wide-scale adoption of recovery supports in the areas of health, home, purpose, and community, SAMHSA has launched Bringing Recovery Supports to Scale Technical Assistance Center Strategy (BRSS TACS). BRSS TACS assists states and others to promote adoption of recovery-oriented supports, services, and systems for people in recovery from substance use and/or mental disorders. Because recovery is based on the involvement of consumers/peers/people in recovery, their family members and caregivers, SMHAs and SSAs can engage these individuals, families, and caregivers in developing recovery-oriented systems and services. States should also support existing and create resources for new consumer, family, and youth networks; recovery community organizations and peer-run organizations; and advocacy organizations to ensure a recovery orientation and expand support networks and recovery services. States are strongly encouraged to engage individuals and families in developing, implementing and monitoring the state M/SUD treatment system.

Provide a description of recovery and recovery support services for adults with SMI and children with SED in your state. DBH certifies 15 recovery support service (RSS) providers who operated a total of 33 facilities. Of the certified RSS providers, nine currently provide District-funded RSS. Also, all but 2 of the certified RSS providers, are DBH-certified SUD treatment providers. There are certified RSS providers in every ward except Wards 3 and 4. In the District of Columbia, adults with SMI and youth with SED are eligible for the same standard non-clinical as individuals in substance use treatment. Our system of care encourages integrated and coordinated care between substance use and mental health providers. Consumers seeking SUD Recovery services must be admitted to SUD services. Additionally, DBH implemented youth peer certification process that will allow youth peers to support other youth in treatment. 4. Provide a description of recovery and recovery support services for individuals with substance use disorders in your state. In the District of Columbia, non-clinical services are provided to an individual by a certified RSS provider to assist him/her in achieving or sustaining recovery from an SUD. There are eight (8) Medicaid billable recovery support services: 1. RECOVERY SUPPORT EVALUATION 2. RECOVERY SUPPORT MANAGEMENT 3. RECOVERY COACHING (Recovery Mentoring & Coaching) 4. RECOVERY SUPPORT SERVICE: LIFE SKILLS SUPPORT SERVICES 5. SPIRITUAL SUPPORT SERVICES 6. EDUCATION SUPPORT SERVICES 7. RECOVERY SOCIAL ACTIVITIES 8. ENVIRONMENTAL STABILITY 5. Does the state have any activities that it would like to highlight? The 1115 demonstration application submitted to the Centers for Medicaid and Medicaid Services provides Medicaid coverage for Recovery Support Services (RSS), some of which may be provided by peers. RSS is currently funded by local dollars, and the new Medicaid funding may help increase access to this service. DBH is also planning to propose regulation changes that will encourage providers at all levels of care to offer peer and recovery supports services.

Does the state have a plan to transition individuals from hospital to community settings? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No 3. What efforts are occurring in the state or being planned to address the ADA community integration mandate required by the Olmstead Decision of 1999? Department of Health Care Finance (DHCF)- The DHCF is the District's Medicaid agency and the primary payer for all long term services and supports (LTSS) the city provides. LTSS can be accessed through a network of five District of Columbia Government agencies and non-profit organizations that will take part in person and family-centered planning and offer information about and recommendations for LTSS. The information will allow people with disabilities, seniors and their families to make choices about the LTSS they need to live with dignity in their homes and be fully included in their communities for as long as possible. The Department of Health Care Finance (https://dhcf.dc.gov/), Department on Disability Services (https://dds.dc.gov/), Department of Behavioral Health (https://dbh.dc.gov/), Department of Human Services (https://dhs.dc.gov/), DC Office on Aging (https://dcoa.dc.gov/) and nonprofit organizations work together to update access to LTSS from different sources. LTSS is related to any persons, of any age or need, who are looking for or planning LTSS. The District spends local and Medicaid dollars on LTSS services and supports based on local and federal annual allocations. D.C. Office on Aging (DCOA)- The DCOA manages the Aging and Disability Resource Center (ADRC) and funds the Senior Service Network. Together these programs consist of more than 20 community-based organizations, operating 37 programs for District residents age 60 and older, people with disabilities (age 1859), and their caregivers. Also, ADRC provides information, coordinates service access, and provides direct social work services to help people move to the community and stay in the community for as long as possible. Department on Disability Services (DDS)- The DDS oversees and coordinates services for District residents with disabilities through a network of community-based service providers. Within DDS, the Developmental Disabilities Administration (DDA) coordinates person-centered home and community services so each person can live and work in the neighborhood of his or her choice. DDA promotes health, wellness, and high quality of life through service coordination and monitoring, clinical supports, and a robust quality management program.Environmental Factors and Plan 17. Community Living and the Implementation of Olmstead - Requested Narrative Question The integration mandate in Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Supreme Court's decision in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999) , provide legal requirements that are consistent with SAMHSA's mission to reduce the impact of M/SUD on America's communities. Being an active member of a community is an important part of recovery for persons with M/SUD conditions. Title II of the ADA and the regulations promulgated for its enforcement require that states provide services in the most integrated setting appropriate to the individual and prohibit needless institutionalization and segregation in work, living, and other settings. In response to the 10th anniversary of the Supreme Court's Olmstead decision, the Coordinating Council on Community Living was created at HHS. SAMHSA has been a key member of the council and has funded a number of technical assistance opportunities to promote integrated services for people with M/SUD needs, including a policy academy to share effective practices with states. Community living has been a priority across the federal government with recent changes to section 811 and other housing programs operated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). HUD and HHS collaborate to support housing opportunities for persons with disabilities, including persons with behavioral illnesses. The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) cooperate on enforcement and compliance measures. DOJ and OCR have expressed concern about some aspects of state mental health systems including use of traditional institutions and other settings that have institutional characteristics to serve persons whose needs could be better met in community settings. More recently, there has been litigation regarding certain evidenced-based supported employment services such as sheltered workshops. States should ensure block grant funds are allocated to support prevention, treatment, and recovery services in community settings whenever feasible and remain committed, as SAMHSA is, to ensuring services are implemented in accordance with Olmstead and Title II of the ADA.

Office of Disability Rights (ODR) - The ODR assesses and evaluates all District agencies' compliance with the ADA and other disability rights laws, providing informal pre-complaint investigation and dispute resolution. ODR also provides expertise, training, and technical assistance regarding ADA compliance and disability sensitivity and rights training to all D.C. agencies. ODR's current initiatives include efforts to increase access to District-owned and leased facilities, worksites, and community spaces; leading monthly disability-wellness seminars; and managing the District's Mentoring Program for students with disabilities. The Olmstead Conference is an annual event created by ODR in conjunction with the Department of Behavioral Health and other stakeholders to promote these legislative rulings. DBH consumers have been responsible for producing the conference since 2008. The conference brings together providers who teach consumers about the rights and privileges created by the Olmstead ruling. The information shared by presenters and vendors helps promote the critical aspects of community-based treatment. Shared information allows consumers the necessary knowledge to help guide their treatment. The choices and decisions of providers on received treatment should support a plan to engage consumers with services in the community. The conference has been an enormous success in the dissemination of positive information about community integration. District of Columbia Olmstead Plan 2017-2020 Since 2007, the District's Office of Disability Rights (ODR) has had the responsibility of developing and submitting the city's Olmstead Compliance Plan to the Mayor for approval. In August 2015, Mayor Muriel Bowser created an Olmstead Working Group charged with making recommendations for revisions to future iterations of the District's Olmstead Plan to support this effort, and to include a broad array of voices in the process. In 2016, during its first full year of existence, the Olmstead Working Group focused its efforts on determining what data the District should track to allow for a comprehensive picture of what transition looks like for individuals leaving institutionalized care and attempting to access long- term services and supports in the District. The Group concentrated its efforts and discussion around data collection that would aid the District in its effort to create a seamless system across agencies that tracks a person's progress toward independence in a meaningful, understandable way. Improving Long-Term Care in the District- The District is engaged in a multi-year effort to design and implement a seamless process for accessing Long Term Services and Supports. The new system embraces the principles of \"No Wrong Door\" and will ensure that individuals receive accurate information regardless of where they enter the system . Efforts are underway to streamline and simplify the eligibility process. These efforts are supported by federal grants including a three year, No Wrong Door Implementation Grant awarded by the Administration on Community Living and CMS, as well as a major grant awarded to the Department of Health Care Finance to support the procurement of a new, multi-agency case management system. These system improvements will reduce fragmentation, and the time it takes to connect to needed services. The Olmstead Plan details remaining system challenges and lays out specific action steps in nine (9) strategic areas. That work will take place within a number of on-going District-level initiatives aimed at systems improvement. These include Age-Friendly DC; DHCF's system reform efforts; Employment First State Leadership Mentoring; National Core Indicators work; and DC's No Wrong Door Initiative. Also, an active advocacy community lends its support and oversight, led by groups such as the DC Developmental Disabilities Council (DDC), Project ACTION! the DC State Rehabilitation Council (DC SRC), and the DC Statewide Independent Living Council (SILC). The 2017 Olmstead Plan- The Olmstead Working Group created a multi-year Plan based on the same nine (9) priority areas that were the focus of the 2016 Plan: 1) A Person-Centered Culture; 2) Community Engagement, Outreach, and Training; 3) Employment; 4) Housing; 5) Intake, Enrollment and Discharge Processes; 6) Medicaid Waiver Management and Systems issues; 7) Quality of Institutional and Community-Based Services, Providers and Workforce; 8) Supporting Children and Youth; and 9) Wellness and Quality of Life. Each action step in each priority area has a measurable, trackable, and meaningful goal that will lead the District into 2020 with a cross-agency system that is more relatable, comprehensive, and based on an individual's preferences and concrete goals while in transition. The District's service system for people with disabilities is comprised of multiple government agencies, public and private institutions that provide residential care, as well as local organizations that receive District and federal funds to provide home- and community-based services. Department of Behavioral Health (DBH) DBH provides prevention, screening and assessment, intervention, and treatment and recovery services and supports for children, youth, and adults with mental health and substance use disorders. Services include emergency psychiatric care, residential services, and community-based outpatient care. DBH also operates Saint Elizabeths Hospital, which is the District's public inpatient psychiatric facility. Department of Health (DOH), the DOH Health and Intermediate Care Facility Divisions, administer all District and federal laws and, regulations governing the licensure, certification, and regulation of all health care facilities in the District of Columbia. In this role, Health Regulation and Licensing Administration (HRLA) staff inspect health care facilities and providers who participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, certified per District and federal laws, respond to consumer and self-reported facility incidents and/or complaints, and conduct investigations, if indicated. When necessary, HRLA takes enforcement actions to compel facilities, Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia Page 2 of 4 Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia - OMB 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 265 of 296providers, and suppliers to come into compliance with District and Federal law. DHCF is the District's Medicaid agency and the primary payer for all long term services and supports the city provides. In fiscal year 2016, the District spent a total of $796 million in Medicaid funds on these services; $241 million (or 30%) were local dollars. These funds pay for care in institutional settings including nursing facilities and Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (ICF/IDDs), as well as a variety of home and community-based services (HCBS), described below. Approximately 44% of total Medicaid funds spent on LTSS were spent on institutional care, while 56% were spent on home and community-based services. Department of Human Services (DHS) Across its extensive range of programming, DHS routinely serves people with disabilities. For example, in fiscal year 2014, approximately 17% of applicants were assessed as likely to have a mental disorder of some magnitude, and 4% to have a learning disability in income-based programs such as TANF, SNAP, and Medicaid. In the homeless services program, 40% of singles and 16% of adult heads of families entering shelters were assessed by DHS to have a disability in at least one of eight categories. In the Adult Protective Services program -- which investigates reports of abuse, neglect, exploitation and self-neglect, and provides temporary services and supports in some founded cases -- an estimated 45% of those served were assessed to have a disability. D.C. Office on Aging (DCOA) DCOA manages the Aging and Disability Resource Center (ADRC) and funds the Senior Service Network, which together consist of more than 20 community-based organizations, operating 37 programs for District residents age 60 and older, people with disabilities (age 18-59), and their caregivers. Also, ADRC provides information, coordinates service access, and provides direct social work services to help people move to the community and stay in the community for as long as possible. In fiscal year 2015, the ADRC served 11,290 people, 9.38% of whom were 18 to 59 years old, living with a disability. The remaining individuals served by ADRC are people age 60 and older who may also have a disability. Department on Disability Services (DDS) DDS oversees and coordinates services for District residents with disabilities through a network of community-based, service providers. Within DDS, the Developmental Disabilities Administration (DDA) coordinates person-centered home and community services so each person can live and work in the neighborhood of his or her choosing. DDA promotes health, wellness, and high quality of life through service coordination and monitoring, clinical supports, and a robust quality management program. In fiscal year 2016, DDA served 2,363 people. DDS's Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) provides comprehensive, person-centered employment services and supports for people with disabilities, pre-employment and transition services for youth with disabilities, independent living services and services for people with visual impairments. In fiscal year 2016 RSA served 7,309 people. Office of Disability Rights (ODR) ODR assesses and evaluates all District agencies' compliance with the ADA and other disability rights laws, providing informal pre-complaint investigation and dispute resolution. ODR also provides expertise, training, and technical assistance regarding ADA compliance and disability sensitivity and rights training to all DC agencies. ODR's current initiatives include efforts to increase access to District-owned and leased facilities, worksites and community spaces; leading monthly disability-wellness seminars and managing the District's Mentoring Program for students with disabilities. Office of the State Superintendent for Education (OSSE) The office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) is the District's state education agency. OSSE is responsible for ensuring that all education-related public agencies identify and evaluate children who may have a disability and provide an education that meets the children's individualized needs alongside peers without disabilities to the maximum extent appropriate. OSSE also has oversight of nonpublic special education schools -- the most restrictive educational placements for children with disabilities. In fiscal year 2015, 12,173 children with qualifying disabilities ages 3- 21 were served. Also, OSSE oversaw IDEA Part C early intervention services for approximately 700 infants and toddlers. Finally, OSSE operated hundreds of buses that traveled 34,000 miles per day to transport more than 3,000 students with disabilities to their schools across the region. Other Government Agencies Many other agencies in the District of Columbia serve and support people with disabilities. In doing so, they interface on a regular basis with the agencies listed above. These other government agencies include: o The DC Housing Authority (DCHA) (Independent agency) o The DC Public Libraries (DCPL) o The DC Public Schools (DCPS) o The Department of Child and Family Services (CFSA) o The Department of Corrections (DOC) o The Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) o The Department of Employment Services (DOES) o The Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) o The Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services (DYRS) o DC Department of Transportation (DDOT) Please indicate areas of technical assistance needed related to this section.

Children and Adolescents M/SUD Services - Required MHBG, Requested SABG Narrative Question MHBG funds are intended to support programs and activities for children and adolescents with SED, and SABG funds are available for prevention, treatment, and recovery services for youth and young adults with substance use disorders. Each year, an estimated 20 percent of children in the U.S. have a diagnosable mental health condition and one in 10 suffers from a serious emotional disturbance that contributes to substantial impairment in their functioning at home, at school, or in the community.63. Most mental disorders have their roots in childhood, with about 50 percent of affected adults manifesting such disorders by age 14, and 75 percent by age 24.64. For youth between the ages of 10 and 24, suicide is the third leading cause of death and for children between 12 and 17, the second leading cause of death.65. It is also important to note that 11 percent of high school students have a diagnosable substance use disorder involving nicotine, alcohol, or illicit drugs, and nine out of 10 adults who meet clinical criteria for a substance use disorder started smoking, drinking, or using illicit drugs before the age of 18. Of people who started using before the age of 18, one in four will develop an addiction compared to one in twenty-five who started using substances after age 21.66. Mental and substance use disorders in children and adolescents are complex, typically involving multiple challenges. These children and youth are frequently involved in more than one specialized system, including mental health, substance abuse, primary health, education, childcare, child welfare, or juvenile justice. This multi-system involvement often results in fragmented and inadequate care, leaving families overwhelmed and children's needs unmet. For youth and young adults who are transitioning into adult responsibilities, negotiating between the child- and adult-serving systems becomes even harder. To address the need for additional coordination, SAMHSA is encouraging states to designate a point person for children to assist schools in assuring identified children are connected with available mental health and/or substance abuse screening, treatment and recovery support services. Since 1993, SAMHSA has funded the Children's Mental Health Initiative (CMHI) to build the system of care approach in states and communities around the country. This has been an ongoing program with 173 grants awarded to states and communities, and every state has received at least one CMHI grant. Since then SAMHSA has awarded planning and implementation grants to states for adolescent and transition age youth SUD treatment and infrastructure development. This work has included a focus on financing, workforce development and implementing evidence- based treatments. For the past 25 years, the system of care approach has been the major framework for improving delivery systems, services, and outcomes for children, youth, and young adults with mental and/or SUD and co-occurring M/SUD and their families. This approach is comprised of a spectrum of effective, community-based services and supports that are organized into a coordinated network. This approach helps build meaningful partnerships across systems and addresses cultural and linguistic needs while improving the child, youth and young adult functioning in home, school, and community. The system of care approach provides individualized services, is family driven; youth guided and culturally competent; and builds on the strengths of the child, youth or young adult and their family to promote recovery and resilience. Services are delivered in the least restrictive environment possible, use evidence-based practices, and create effective cross-system collaboration including integrated management of service delivery and costs.67. According to data from the 2015 Report to Congress68 on systems of care, services: 1. reach many children and youth typically underserved by the mental health system; 2. improve emotional and behavioral outcomes for children and youth; 3. enhance family outcomes, such as decreased caregiver stress; 4. decrease suicidal ideation and gestures; 5. expand the availability of effective supports and services; and 6. save money by reducing costs in high cost services such as residential settings, inpatient hospitals, and juvenile justice settings. SAMHSA expects that states will build on the well-documented, effective system of care approach to serving children and youth with serious M/SUD needs. Given the multi- system involvement of these children and youth, the system of care approach provides the infrastructure to improve care coordination and outcomes, manage costs, and better invest resources. The array of services and supports in the system of care approach includes: non-residential services (e.g., wraparound service planning, intensive case management, outpatient therapy, intensive home-based services, SUD intensive outpatient services, continuing care, and mobile crisis response); supportive services, (e.g., peer youth support, family peer support, respite services, mental health consultation, and supported education and employment); and Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia Page 1 of 3 Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia - OMB 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 268 of 296Please respond to the following items: 1.

Describe how the state provide integrated services through the system of care (social services, educational services, child welfare services, juvenile justice services, law enforcement services, substance use disorders, etc.) The Adolescent Substance Abuse Treatment Expansion Program (ASTEP) is the District of Columbia's adolescent substance abuse treatment. ASTEP has made substance abuse treatment more accessible by giving adolescents, as well as their families and caregivers, the ability to go directly to any ASTEP treatment program for a substance abuse assessment. Every adolescent accessing substance abuse treatment through ASTEP will be screened for indicators of a mental health disorder. Adolescents can choose the program that best fits their lives; whether the program they choose is closest to home, offers convenient hours, or provides recovery support services to help them maintain sobriety. DBH was awarded the State Youth Treatment grant from SAMHSA to enhance co-occurring treatment within the adolescent treatment network. The Evidence-based practice selected to implement the SYT Services in our jurisdiction is the Adolescent -Community Rehabilitation Approach (A-CRA). The A-CRA model incorporates primary care into the treatment modality as well as the various other family and community supports. This initiative has built capacity within the network as well as the workforce in our adolescent system. In FY17 and continuing into FY18 DBH is expanding these services to the Transitional Aged Youth (TAY) in our Adult Substance Abuse Rehabilitation Services (ASARS) programs, which is Medicaid reimbursable. Currently, DBH has a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between DBH and the Child and Family Services Agency (CFSA), the public child welfare agency in the District of Columbia responsible for protecting child victims, and those at risk of abuse and neglect and assisting their families. CFSA personnel conducts screenings on selected cohorts of youth and adults with child residential services (e.g., like therapeutic foster care, crisis stabilization services, and inpatient medical detoxification). 63Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, (2013).

Have you updated your state's suicide prevention plan in the last 2 years? nmlkj Yes nmlkji No 2. Describe activities intended to reduce incidents of suicide in your state. Access HelpLine Division (AHL)- This Division is located within the Clinical Services Administration. One of the AHL roles is to provide telephonic suicide prevention and other counseling as appropriate. The AHL responds to incoming suicide and related calls on behalf of the: 1) Department of Behavioral Health, and 2) Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. Systems Transformation Administration- During 2017, DBH developed and published a Suicide Prevention and Intervention Policy. As DBH goes through its regular reaccreditation process for its Access HelpLine to operate as a National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, DBH is reviewing this policy, which would help to lay the foundation for the development of the Department of Behavioral Health Suicide Prevention and Intervention Plan. As well, DC's school mental health initiative provides suicide prevention in the form of two evidence-based programs. Signs of Suicide is a program for middle and high school students that involves screening and classroom based prevention sessions. As well, QPR, Question Persuade and Refer, focuses on how to intervene with someone who may be exhibiting sign of suicide. There is also a program for elementary students, Let's Talk, which focuses more on risk factors that can be precursors of suicidality, such as bullying. 3. Have you incorporated any strategies supportive of Zero Suicide? nmlkj Yes nmlkji No 4. Do you have any initiatives focused on improving care transitions for suicidal patients being discharged from inpatient units or emergency departments? nmlkj Yes nmlkji No 5. Have you begun any targeted or statewide initiatives since the FFY 2018-FFY 2019 plan was submitted? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No If so, please describe the population targeted. This law requires the Office of the State Superintendent for Education (OSSE) to adopt a rule requiring all District teachers and principals in public and charter schools to undergo training on suicide prevention, intervention, and prevention every 2 years. It also requires OSSE to develop and publish online written guidance to assist local education agencies (LEAs) in developing policies and procedures for handling various aspects of student mental and behavioral health. OSSE must examine and evaluate its guidance every 5 years, at a minimum, and notify LEAs within 30 days of updating the guidance. The law also requires OSSE to establish and implement a pilot program to collect school climate data (data regarding engagement, safety, and environment) through school climate surveys, and report school climate data to the Mayor and Council annually. Please indicate areas of technical assistance needed related to this section. The Department of Behavioral Health (DBH) has developed a Suicide Prevention and Intervention Guidelines Policy. DBH would like to seek technical assistance related to developing a Suicide Prevention and Intervention Plan.Environmental Factors and Plan 19. Suicide Prevention - Required for MHBG Narrative Question Suicide is a major public health concern, it is the 10th leading cause of death overall, with over 40,000 people dying by suicide each year in the United States. The causes of suicide are complex and determined by multiple combinations of factors, such as mental illness, substance abuse, painful losses, exposure to violence, and social isolation. Mental illness and substance abuse are possible factors in 90 percent of the deaths from suicide, and alcohol use is a factor in approximately one-third of all suicides. Therefore, SAMHSA urges M/SUD agencies to lead in ways that are suitable to this growing area of concern. SAMHSA is committed to supporting states and territories in providing services to individuals with SMI/SED who are at risk for suicide using MHBG funds to address these risk factors and prevent suicide. SAMHSA encourages the M/SUD agencies play a leadership role on suicide prevention efforts, including shaping, implementing, monitoring, care, and recovery support services among individuals with SMI/SED.

Has your state added any new partners or partnerships since the last planning period? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No 2. Has your state identified the need to develop new partnerships that you did not have in place? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No If yes, with whom? The Department of Behavioral Health (DBH) has developed new partners as well as participated in new projects with existing partners. The new initiatives include: 1) Early Childhood Innovative Network (ECIN) that is part of the Children's National Health System to develop new strategies to support and improve services in child development centers and schools; 2) D.C. SEED a SAMHSA grant awarded to DBH that focuses on the system of care for children age 0-6 who are at risk of and/or experiencing serious emotional disturbances which also includes community partners; and 3) Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) continues to include DBH and other agencies in various initiatives such as the State Early Childhood Coordinating Council work groups (Data Committee and Health and Well Being Sub-Committee) and the Quality Improvement Network (QIN) that focuses on building high quality, comprehensive early childhood development and family engagement services for infants and toddlers and OSSE was awarded this year a Pre-School Development Grant and DBH has received funding from OSSE to implement an expansion of the early childhood mental health consultation program, Healthy Futures. 3. Describe the manner in which your state and local entities will coordinate services to maximize the efficiency, effectiveness, quality and cost-effectiveness of services and programs to produce the best possible outcomes with other agencies to enable consumers to function outside of inpatient or residential institutions, including services to be provided by local school systems under the Individuals with Disabilites Education Act. The Department of Behavioral Health (DBH) coordinates services through interagency partnerships, its provider network, and other community-based programs. The Department maximizes the efficiency, effectiveness, quality and cost-effectiveness of services and programs through both buyer and seller relationships. DBH provides its consumers/clients a variety of behavioral health treatment services and supports that allows them to move appropriately through inpatient, residential and community- based options. This may also include opportunities such as job training, employment, and housing. Also, DBH works closely with the Office of the State Superintendent of Education on matters related to the Individuals with Environmental Factors and Plan 20. Support of State Partners - Required for MHBG Narrative Question The success of a state's MHBG and SABG programs will rely heavily on the strategic partnership that SMHAs and SSAs have or will develop with other health, social services, and education providers, as well as other state, local, and tribal governmental entities. Examples of partnerships may include: The SMA agreeing to consult with the SMHA or the SSA in the development and/or oversight of health homes for individuals with chronic health conditions or consultation on the benefits available to any Medicaid populations; The state justice system authorities working with the state, local, and tribal judicial systems to develop policies and programs that address the needs of individuals with M/SUD who come in contact with the criminal and juvenile justice systems, promote strategies for appropriate diversion and alternatives to incarceration, provide screening and treatment, and implement transition services for those individuals reentering the community, including efforts focused on enrollment; The state education agency examining current regulations, policies, programs, and key data-points in local and tribal school districts to ensure that children are safe, supported in their social/emotional development, exposed to initiatives that target risk and protective factors for mental and substance use disorders, and, for those youth with or at-risk of emotional behavioral and SUDs, to ensure that they have the services and supports needed to succeed in school and improve their graduation rates and reduce out-of-district placements; The state child welfare/human services department, in response to state child and family services reviews, working with local and tribal child welfare agencies to address the trauma and mental and substance use disorders in children, youth, and family members that often put children and youth at-risk for maltreatment and subsequent out-of-home placement and involvement with the foster care system, including specific service issues, such as the appropriate use of psychotropic medication for children and youth involved in child welfare; The state public housing agencies which can be critical for the implementation of Olmstead; The state public health authority that provides epidemiology data and/or provides or leads prevention services and activities; and The state's office of homeland security/emergency management agency and other partners actively collaborate with the SMHA/SSA in planning for emergencies that may result in M/SUD needs and/or impact persons with M/SUD conditions and their families and caregivers, providers of M/SUD services, and the state's ability to provide M/SUD services to meet all phases of an emergency (mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery) and including appropriate engagement of volunteers with expertise and interest in M/SUD.

How was the Council involved in the development and review of the state plan and report? Please attach supporting documentation (meeting minutes, letters of support, etc.) using the upload option at the bottom of this page. a) What mechanism does the state use to plan and implement substance misuse prevention, SUD treatment and recovery services? The District of Columbia Department of Behavioral Health (DBH) serves as the State Mental Health Authority (SMHA) and the District of Columbia Single State Agency (SSA) for substance use disorders. In the latter role DBH: 1) operates four (4) community prevention centers each serving two (2) of the 8 District wards; 2) provides services and contracts with community providers for substance use disorder (SUD) services and supports; 3) assess and refer adults seeking treatment for SUD to appropriate services; 4) the Mobile Assessment and Referral Center (MARC) visits communities throughout the District to conduct assessment, referral, and HEP-C and HIV testing; 5) annual prevention symposium; 6) adults, young adults and youth substance youth campaigns (marijuana use, synthetic drug use, opioid use); and 7) recovery coaching training. Launched in 2018, LIVE. LONG. DC., the District's Strategic Plan to Reduce Opioid Use, Misuse, and Related Deaths, will the foundation for a city-wide effort to ensure equitable and timely access to high-quality substance use disorder treatment and RSS through a network of treatment services to meet demand consistent with the criteria of the American Society of Addiction Medicine; educate District residents and key stakeholders on the risk of opioid use disorder (OUD) and effective prevention and treatment; engage health professionals and organizations in the prevention and early intervention of substance use disorder among District residents; support the awareness and availability of, and access to, harm reduction services in the District of Columbia consistent with evolving best and promising practices; develop and implement a shared vision between the District's justice and public health agencies to address the needs of individuals who come in contact with the criminal justice system; and prepare for program sustainability through evaluation, planning, and performance monitoring and training. Further, the Mayor of the District of Columbia, Muriel Bowser, participates with the leadership of Maryland and Virginia to address the regional opioid crisis. Also, the District has an Epidemiological Outcomes Workgroup (DC EOW). b) Has the Council successfully integrated substance misuse prevention and treatment or co- occurring disorder issues, concerns, and activities into its work? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No 2. Is the membership representative of the service area population (e.g. ethnic, cultural, linguistic, rural, suburban, urban, older adults, families of young children)? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No 3. Please describe the duties and responsibilities of the Council, including how it gathers meaningful input from people in recovery, families, and other important stakeholders, and how it has advocated for individuals with SMI or SED. Environmental Factors and Plan 21. State Planning/Advisory Council and Input on the Mental Health/Substance Abuse Block Grant Application- Required for MHBG Narrative Question Each state is required to establish and maintain a state Mental Health Planning/Advisory Council to carry out the statutory functions as described in 42 U.S. C. 300x-3 for adults with SMI and children with SED. To meet the needs of states that are integrating services supported by MHBG and SABG, SAMHSA is recommending that states expand their Mental Health Advisory Council to include substance misuse prevention, SUD treatment, and recovery representation, referred to here as an Advisory/Planning Council (PC).SAMHSA encourages states to expand their required Council's comprehensive approach by designing and implementing regularly scheduled collaborations with an existing substance misuse prevention, SUD treatment, and recovery advisory council to ensure that the council reviews issues and services for persons with, or at risk, for substance misuse and SUDs. To assist with implementing a PC, SAMHSA has created Best Practices for State Behavioral Health Planning Councils: The Road to Planning Council Integration.69 Planning Councils are required by statute to review state plans and implementation reports; and submit any recommended modifications to the state. Planning councils monitor, review, and evaluate, not less than once each year, the allocation and adequacy of mental health services within the state. They also serve as an advocate for individuals with M/SUD problems. SAMHSA requests that any recommendations for modifications to the application or comments to the implementation report that were received from the Planning Council be submitted to SAMHSA, regardless of whether the state has accepted the recommendations. The documentation, preferably a letter signed by the Chair of the Planning Council, should state that the Planning Council reviewed the application and implementation report and should be transmitted as attachments by the state. 69https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/manual-planning-council-best-practices-2014.pdf Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia Page 1 of 18 Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia - OMB 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 274 of 296The overall goals of the DBH/BHPC is to advise the Department of Behavioral Health as follows: 1. To ensure that individuals in need of mental health and/or substance use disorder services have access to services; 2. To ensure that consumer and family directed services and supports for the prevention and treatment of mental health and substance use disorders maintain a focus on recovery and resilience; 3. To advocate for District residents with serious emotional disturbances, mental health issues, and substance use disorders; 4. To support the integration of mental and substance use disorder prevention, treatment and recovery services and supports into overall health services; 5. To reduce disparities in the prevention and treatment of mental health and substance use disorders; 6. To strengthen the coordination and collaboration with relevant state and community organizations in order to develop systems of care; and 7. To provide input for the development of the SAMHSA Mental Health and Substance Abuse Block Grants. The DBH/BHPC has achieved this primarily by sharing information, inviting relevant agency presentations and participation, and whenever asked or invited to relevant Departmental endeavors. Please indicate areas of technical assistance needed related to this section. Technical assistance is needed to fulfill the federal mandate to monitor, review, and evaluate at least once each year the allocation and adequacy of mental health and substance use disorder services within the District, and use the findings to review the Block Grant Plans and make recommendations. The Behavioral Health Planning Council would benefit from Technical Assistance focused on participatory-based discussions and input concentrating on continuous improvement and training to develop its relationship to integrated planning in Citywide councils and work groups. Additionally, please complete the Behavioral Health Advisory Council Members and Behavioral Health Advisory Council Composition by Member Type forms.70 70There are strict state Council membership guidelines. States must demonstrate: (1) the involvement of people in recovery and their family members; (2) the ratio of parents of children with SED to other Council members is sufficient to provide adequate representation of that constituency in deliberations on the Council; and (3) no less than 50 percent of the members of the Council are individuals who are not state employees or providers of mental health services.

Bazron, Ph.D. Director, Department of Behavioral Health 64 New York Avenue, NE, 3rd Floor Washington, DC 2000 2 Dear Dr. Bazron: I am submitting this letter on behalf of the District of Columbia Department of Behavioral Health (DBH) Behavioral Health Council (BHPC) to convey our general support of the District of Columbia FY 20/21 Mental Health/Substance Abuse Block Grant Application (MHBG). However, we believe that there are long-standing concerns which need to be addressed and wish to provide input on those issues. D.C. DBH View of Departments of Mental Health/ Substance Use Initiatives, Programs, and Services Our Council believes that DBH's initiatives, programs, and services as a whole are generally sound and indicate noble intentions. However, the implementation strategies continue to be problematic and need attention. We strongly support the Department's: 1115 demonstration; Expansion of the Community Response Team; Expansion of Children's Services through the School-Based Mental Health programs and community supports; Expansion of Children's Services through the enhanced School-Based Mental Health programs and community supports; the Behavioral Health Needs Assessment and certainly Technical Assistance to support this Behavioral Health Planning Council. We believe that any initiatives specifically funded by the Block Grant, should: 1) directly benefit children and youth with serious emotional disturbances (SED) and or comorbidity and their families; as well as 2) adults with serious mental illness (SMI),and or Substance use disorders; 3) be innovative and use evidence-based, best and/or promising practices; 4) identify mea surable results; 5) describe consumer outcomes; 6) are monitored and evaluated and 7) address the serious shortage of qualified, culturally competent providers. These beliefs guide our Council's deliberations, activities, and participation in DBH and other planning initiatives, as we review and critique the Department's performance throughout the year. Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia Page 3 of 18 Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 276 of Initiatives Several noteworthy DBH initiatives are department-wide and address the adult and child systems of care and represent the continuity of successful endeavors. These include, but are not limited to the efforts that follow: Departmental Initiatives The system-wide noteworthy initiatives include: 1) Citywide conferences such as the annual Olmstead Conference held in collaboration with the D.C. Office of Disability Rights; The DBH 2019 Recovery Conference and Live Long Community Conversations, (2) Consumer-oriented initiatives such as the Peer Specialist Certification program producing Peer Transition Specialists who assist persons leaving the hospital with community reintegration; the funding of consumer-run organizations to provide advocacy, obtain consumer feedback, provide training and outreach to consumers. Also, consumer training enabled persons to create and operate a self-help center, (3) Expansion of the Crisis Intervention Collaborative so that not only police officers are trained to interact positively with persons with mental illnesses, but training is also provided on this initiative to 911 call takers, dispatchers, and coordinators, and 4) Most importantly, the Department has remained out of Court Sanctions and Oversight. Adult System : The adult system of care noteworthy initiatives include: 1) the work of the Integrated Care Division on behalf or individuals leaving the hospital and/or in the community who require intensive care management to remain in the community; 2) the Mobile Crisis Services Homicide Survivor Response Project in collaboration with the Office of Victim Services and the Police Department that will ensure the availability of mental health assistance for homicide survivors; and 3) creating a Quality Improvement Plan for Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) services, including conducting fidelity assessments. Child System : The child system of care noteworthy initiatives include: 1) the Early Childhood Mental Health Consultation Project that focuses on child and family-centered, and program consultation, which received some funding from the FY 2010 Mental Health Block Grant; 2) establishment of the Parent-Infant Early Childhood Enhancement Program (P.I.E.C.E.) that primarily serves children age 5 and under: 3) expansion of the Primary Project that serves children with mild school adjustment issues in kindergarten through first grade, 4) implementation of the Transition-Age Youth, Development Project that adopted the Transition to Independence Process (TIP) model, an evidence-based practice, funded by FY' 2009 Mental Health Block Grant funds, and5) Implementation of Capital CARES (Citywide Approach Reduce Risk for And Eliminate Youth Suicide) grant that focuses on preventing suicide behaviors among all District youth. Status of Concerns in the FY' 20-21 Mental Health and Substance Use Block Grant Some of the concerns our Council raised related to the FY 20-21- Mental Health and Substance Health Block Grant are as follows: Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia Page 4 of 18 Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia - OMB 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 277 of 296 1. A deep concern that our members, the Planning and Accountability Committee specifically , and the consumer community generally, were not involved in the pre-planning of this Block Grant Application as early as practical for a volunteer organization. Family and consumer-run organizations (regardless of contract status) need to be involved in the pre-planning process, so the needs of the whole community are heard, understood, and incorporated into any planning process and the resultant policies and services. The recent administration changes indicate that this concern will be addressed and ameliorated. 2. There appear to be some gaps in services as outlined in the MHGB application. A major concern centered on the heavy emphasis on opioids and opioid treatment policies. The council is concerned that this disproportionate funding of substance use may have the unintended consequence of decreasing the much-needed funding for mental health services and attention. 3. The Planning and Accountability Committee believed that there was a lack of emphasis on the needs of youth and young adults with ESMIs and/or substance use disorders. 4. The most important unmet service needs or critical gaps in the adult service systems were identified as: Still cumbersome access of consumers and families who are not skilled technology users or who lack access to technology Hours of operation for many services are often 9-5 and absent during holidays or weekends. High turnover of providers serving both the children and adult population No easily accessible reports to public about complaints, sanctions, etc., of service providers, including hospitals. Satisfaction survey instruments too cumbersome, and delayed with no evidence of the influence of the results. Lack of coordination, resource sharing, and addressing of duplication of services with the private sector. Too many ombudsmen who appear to have overlapping, duplicate missions which confuse consumers, family members, and the general public. 5. Monitoring of DC CSA system: Our Council's concerns included the process for addressing issues when the consumer expresses dissatisfaction with the new provider and the types of post- transfer variables that might be assessed that signal a red flag and those that indicate positive adjustment. 6. Transition Age Youth and Older Adults: Our Council has long believed that services for transition-age youth and older adults represent two (2) major service system gaps due primarily to the lack of a conceptual framework that addresses the service needs of these populations. 8. Housing for Mental Health Substance Use Consumers: Our Council's primary concern was how the DBH housing initiatives and other housing initiatives in the District come together in a Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia Page 5 of 18 Printed: 8/30/2019 5:03 PM - District of Columbia - OMB 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 278 of 296 way that expands the housing options for mental health consumers and other disability categories. 9. Older Adults: There appears to have been no activities during FY 2018 that would move DBH closer to articulating a service strategy for older adults. Particularly those with dual diagnoses. Our Council would like to reiterate the questions that were raised for many years. Some may have been addressed, but the data has not been shared with the Council, and the information is not clear to the community at large. Some of the questions are: What is currently known about older adults? How many are in the system? Where are they in the system? What unique service needs do they represent? What services do they receive? What is the relationship between the services they need and those they receive? What public and private community resources are available to assist DBH in addressing their service needs? What partnerships can DBH form related to avail resources for these populations? How do other states address the service needs of these populations? What resources will be identified to implement the planned service strategies for these populations? Our Council looks forward to continuing to work with DBH programs to improve the delivery of Mental Health and Substance Use services for District residents. We welcome your leadership and look forward to a long and productive tenure. Sincerely, Senora D. Simpson (Electronically Signed) Senora D.

She also encouraged BHPC members to review their ability and commitment to engage in BHPC business and either to participate or to resign; she stated that she realized she was 'preaching to the choir', since those in attendance had demonstrated their intention to participate and her message needed to reach those not in attendance. Old Business - 35 K Work Group: Jackie Richardson provided a report on the activities of the 35 K work group. She made a remi nder that Dr. Nesbitt, while interim DBH director, created the work group in response to BHPC recommendations. Ms. Richardson expressed concern about accelerating the consumer experience survey, with need to collect sufficient data to consider the sustaina bility of any proposed changes. Chair Simpson stated we need to know metrics of consumer experience being measured and performance expectation for staff. Charles Gervin stated the ad hoc workgroup had developed a process that has allowed development of transparency and buy -in. He called on BHPC to remember the work so far has been building pilots, and sometimes that requires making changes. He stated the work group took complaints about 35 K seriously and that people at 35 K took complaints about 35 K serio usly Chair Simpson reiterated that she would like to see preliminary survey tools being developed and preliminary results of the reported consumer experience. Elizabeth Maldonado expressed concern that there was a lack of Spanish -language support at DC det ox sites, which Chair Simpson indicated should be considered at some other time and was not part of the scope of the 35 K ad hoc work group.

Regarding Forensic ACT, Mr. Howard referred to SAMHSA information provided and stated, \"If I had a FACT Team, it would be more helpful to me,\" compared to traditional ACT teams or other services. Mr. Howard referred to Forensic Peers slides that h e also presented, making major points that there was need for Forensic Peers to make FACT part of successful use of the Sequential Intercept Model and that there was need for Forensic Peers with lived experience. Mr. Howard requested for DBH to create a FA CT program in DC, by written report of the BHPC to Dr. Bazron and requested to review forensic service use of Social Detox models to assist with opioid use disorder or other substance use disorder populations. Atiya Frame stated that DBH Family and Communi ty Affairs would review creation of Forensically Certified Peer Specialists, and she noted Live.Long.DC / State Opioid Response federal grant funds might provide support to launch that initiative. She stated that DBH would also review whether FACT is suppo rted under the current Medicaid State Plan as a specialized version of ACT or if any State Plan Amendment would be needed and that DBH would review if changes to DBH regulations would be needed to specifically certify FACT providers.
