Zanoni, Medical Meditation & Qi Gong Instruction What do you think of a medicine that: -- Prevents or treats most long-term chronic conditions -- Is very ancient, going back at least 4,000 years -- Costs nothing -- Is available everywhere -- Is effective at a dosage of twenty minutes once a day every three days -- Has no side-effects -- Improves your quality of life --Will never run out -- Increases in quality the longer that you use it This is what meditation is! An important component of my practice is teaching meditation and Qi Gong. The meditation is a form known as Calm Abiding. It is simple to teach, easy to learn, and very effective for conditions such as high blood pressure, insomnia, and anxiety. This type of Qi Gong is an internal (mental or Nei Gong) style performed seated. This makes it appropriate for patients with neurological conditions such as Parkinson's syndromes, MS, motor neuron disease, arthritis, or difficulties with balance. Classes in meditation and Nei Gong are generally held in Kailua.

The audio files below concern learning how to meditate and ways of improving skill in relating to our Consciousness. There are also some files about learning how to meditate for medical therapeutic purposes, such as controlling hypertension or stress. There are also files about Si Gua Qi Gong, which is a therapeutic qi gong for developing physical balance. "}
