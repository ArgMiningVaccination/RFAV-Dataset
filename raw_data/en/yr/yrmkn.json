Cancer Archive Articles [](https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/study-links-gum-disease-to-cancer-in-older-women) Study links gum disease to cancer in older women Experts says it's too early for alarm, but the findings provide another good reason to pay attention to oral health. Image: \u00a9 Glayan/Thinkstock Is gum disease linked to cancer? A study published in the August issue of Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention suggests a tie between the two, finding that older women with gum disease had a higher risk for cancers of the breast, lung, and esophagus as well as melanoma, the most dangerous form of skin cancer. But it's not time to sound the alarm just yet, because while the study was published in a well-regarded journal, it had limitations that may have affected the results, says Alessandro Villa, instructor in oral medicine, infection, and immunity at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine and associate surgeon at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Even so, he says, your oral health should still be a top priority because while it may be premature to say gum disease and cancer are linked, research has shown that gum disease, also known as periodontal disease, may increase the risk of heart disease and other health problems.

Study authors encourage doctors and patients to have frank and thorough discussions about about the risks and benefits of various forms of treatment for prostate cancer.

I am 77 and in overall good health. My previous colonoscopies to check for colon cancer have been normal. Can I stop having them? A. The major benefit of colon cancer screening is seen in men ages 50 to 75. After age 75, the potential benefit is smaller, and the risks and side effects of the procedure \u2014 like bleeding and perforation of the colon \u2014 are higher.

CAR T-cell immunotherapy adds a new weapon in the fight against cancer. Immunotherapy, one of the most exciting advances in cancer treatment, helps the immune system better target and kill cancer cells by focusing only on the cancerous cells while sparing the healthy ones. One of the most innovative immunotherapies today is chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, which is custom-made for individuals and their specific cancer. [](https://www.health.harvard.edu/cancer/melanoma-isnt-the-only-skin-cancer) Melanoma isn't the only skin cancer Research we're watching You probably know to have your skin checked frequently for the signs of melanoma. But you should also be looking out for another, more common type of skin cancer \u2014 squamous cell carcinoma. This potentially lethal skin cancer can show up on your skin as a white or pink bump, a non-healing sore, or even a scaly patch. According to the American Academy of Dermatology, cases of squamous cell carcinoma are on the rise, with some 700,000 new diagnoses each year. \"While other skin cancers may be more lethal, they're less common,\" writes Dr. M. Laurin Council, an assistant professor of dermatology at Washington University in St. Louis. \"Squamous cell carcinoma is highly treatable when detected early, so it's important for people to know the signs of this disease and keep a close eye on their skin.\" [](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/erectile-dysfunction-drugs-not-linked-to-melanoma) Erectile dysfunction drugs not linked to melanoma In the journals The erectile dysfunction drugs collectively known as phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, such as sildenafil (Viagra), may not cause melanoma, the most dangerous form of skin cancer, according to a study published online May 19, 2017, by the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. In 2016, the FDA put PDE5 inhibitors on its watch list of medications with possible safety issues after some studies suggested they might increase the risk for melanoma. In response to the FDA's action, researchers analyzed data from five large-scale studies of the issue, involving 866,049 men, published between 2014 and 2016. [](https://www.health.harvard.edu/cancer/factors-that-increase-your-risk-for-a-secondary-cancer) Factors that increase your risk for a secondary cancer Several factors can make you more likely to develop a secondary cancer. Some are under your control. Others aren't. It's important for you to discuss your risks with your doctor and find out what you can do to lower your odds of developing cancer again. Equally important, discuss how often you need to get screened, so you can catch any new cancers early. Childhood cancer. If you developed cancer before age 15, you'll need to stay on top of your health in the years to come. Some childhood tumors are caused by inherited syndromes that contribute to a lifelong increased risk for cancer. For example, Li-Fraumeni syndrome can lead to sarcoma, leukemia, and brain and breast cancers. The treatments you received to combat childhood cancer can also make you more vulnerable to future malignancies.
