Baker, MD, PhD* *Department of Pediatrics, Digestive Disease and Nutrition Center, Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, Buffalo, NY Education and Practice Gaps Children frequently have acute abdominal pain. The physician must identify which child has a potentially catastrophic condition ( <2%). Because the number of patients requiring immediate action is low, the physician can belulled into a sense of safety. Infrequently, acute abdominal pain can becatastrophic, so the physician needs to be cognizant of conditions requiringaction. Knowledge and judgment are key. Objectives After completing this article, readers should be able to: 1. Understand the causes and frequency of acute abdominal pain in childhood. 2. Develop a differential diagnosis based on age and symptoms. 3. Formulate a plan for evaluation and management of acute abdominal pain. 4. Choose the appropriate imaging study for various diagnoses. Acute abdominal pain is a frequent and challenging problem facing pediatricians. The cause of acute abdominal pain can range from John Apley 's\"little bellyacher \" (1) to an emergency requiring immediate action. Assessing acute abdominal pain is a situation that requires excellent clinical acumen, an area where pediatriciansshould \"prove their worth \"by outperforming other primary caregivers. Making the correct diagnosis may earn the pediatrician accolades for saving a life (as inthe case of intussusception or midgut volvulus) but may also not win friends(as when a mother is informed that the reason for her child 's excruciating pain is constipation). A mistaken diagnosis can have devastating results, either by not acting when action is called for or by performing unnecessary tests andprocedures. Because the differential diagnosis list for acute abdominal pain is long, a logical approach is to consider diagnoses by age group. Convenient age divisions aren e o n a t e s ,0t o2m o n t h s ;i n f a n t s ,3t o1 2 months; preschoolers, 1 to 5 years; children, 6 to 11 years; and adolescents, 12 to 18 years. Within each of these groupsa diagnosis can be categorized as common or uncommon and as serious or lessserious (Tables 1 through 5). (Note that designation as \"serious \"and \"less serious \"AUTHOR DISCLOSURE Dr Baker has disclosed that he is a subinvestigator on PROKIDS (Pediatric Resource Organization for Kids with Inflammatory Intestinal Disease) and RISK (Pediatric Risk Strati cation Study) grants.

Diagnoses are not listed in order of frequency.) Abdominal pain is perceived via mucosal or serosal recep- tors. These pain receptors are located on serosal surfaces, inthe mesentery, and in the intestinal wall. Abdominal pain is poorly localized, often being perceived as midline, until the serosal surface becomes affected, as in appendicitis; then better localization occurs. (2) Children younger than 5 years are not able to localize pain well. A young child with acute otitis media may complain of abdominal pain. For most children with acute abdominal pain, the pain is short, self-resolving, and non- life-threatening. In a study that included almost 1,000 children aged 4 to 18 years, closeto 10% had at least 1 episode of acute abdominal pain thatcame to medical attention. Constipation accounted for 48% of these episodes, and 19% of the episodes went undiag- nosed. Only 2% had a surgical cause for acute abdominal pain. (3) For the few that have conditions that require immediate action, age at onset, concomitant signs, symp- toms, or history frequently lead to the correct disposition. For this reason, a detailed history, including history of the present condition, past medical history, and family history, and a complete physical examination (not just the abdomen)are essential. The digital rectal examination (DRE) has the potential to add important information regarding the cause of acute abdominal pain. A DRE can quickly establish the presence of constipation. Although constipation is a fre- quent cause of pain, the child with constipation may have acute abdominal pain due to unrelated causes. Frequently, laboratory investigation and imaging are performed. The results of these tests, along with age, history, and physical examination ndings, weigh into the nal conclusion. Com- ing to the correct disposition of a patient with acute abdominalpain relies on assembling available information and thenj u d i c i o u s l yc o n s i d e r i n gt h el i k e l yd i a g n o s e s . APPENDICITIS Appendicitis is the most common abdominal surgical emer- gency in childhood, although it is relatively uncommon inchildren younger than 5 years (Tables 3 through 5). It can be rapidly progressive; from onset to perforation can be asshort as 12 hours. Several scoring systems have been devised for the diagnosis of appendicitis in children. The 2 most widely used are the Alvarado score and the Pediatric Ap- pendicitis Score. Both are based on similar parameters; however, the usefulness of both these scores has been questioned. (4) The scoring systems have been largely superseded by imaging studies that have changed the way in which appendicitis is diagnosed. The rst is point of service ultrasonography. Ultrasonography has the obvi-ous advantages of being readily available, being noninvasive, and avoiding radiation exposure. In the event that ultra-sonography demonstrates appendicitis, it is highly speci c. In a pediatric study, point o fs e r v i c eu l t r a s o n o g r a p h y conrmed a diagnosis in 51% of patients, thus avoiding computed tomography (CT). However, the usefulness ofultrasonography is limited, especially in obese children and in uncooperative children. Computed tomography remains the most accurate imaging study for diagnosing appendi- citis. In many institutions it has become the imaging mo- dality of choice. In one study it reduced the false-negativeappendectomy rate from 23% to 1.7% in an 18-year period. At the conclusion of the study, essentially all of the patients who had surgery for appendicitis had a CT scan before surgery. (5) Because the radiation dose from a CT scan is high, efforts have concentrated on reducing the amount of radiation. A CT scan that uses lower levels of ionizing radiation and targeted CT sc ans have reduced radiation exposure. An avenue to eliminate radiation is the use ofmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI). As technology advances, MRI may become the imaging modality of choice; however, the time required for the study and the motion artifact are toogreat at present for routine use in diagnosing appendicitis. Serum markers, although nonspeci c, can be of help. White blood cell (WBC) count with a lift shift and C-reactive protein(CRP) level in combination have 94% speci city. De nitive management remains surgery. INTUSSUSCEPTION Intussusception refers to invagination of a proximal seg- ment of bowel (the intussusceptum) into a distal segment (the intussuscepens). The intussusceptum drags its mes- entery with it into the distal bowel, leading to venous and lymphatic obstruction, ischemia, and perforation. This mechanism results in the classic triad of intermittent, severe abdominal pain, a sausage-shaped mass, and \"currant jelly \" stools. Especially early in the condition, intussusceptioncan present with listlessness and a septiclike picture. TABLE 1.

Within this age range, usually the terminal segment of the ileum invaginates into the cecum, creating an ileocolic intussusception. Peyer patches may act as the lead point of the intussusc eptum. Hypertrophy of Peyer patches, as with viral illness or rotavirus vaccination, has beenassociated with intussusception. Other lead points are possible, especially outside the 6- to 36-month age range, includingMeckel diverticulum, polyps, lymphoma, and duplications. Even after successful reduction of the intussusception, it is not unusual to have 1 or more recurrent episodes. Because of improved diagnosis and treatment, the classic triad is now seldom seen. The more favorable outcome ismost likely due to early diagnosis and more successful treatment. Ultrasonography has become the diagnostic method of choice, where the intussusception shows as a \"target-shaped \"nding. The speci city of ultrasonography approaches 100%. (6) Both CTand MRI are also excellent atvisualizing an intussusception. Except in complicated or equivocal cases, there is seldom need to resort to these more complicated diagnostic imaging studies. However, the in-creased use of these studies in other situations has revealed that transient, self-resolving, asymptomatic small-bowel intussusceptions occur frequently and do not require treatment. There are a variety of nonsurgical techniques for reduc- ing an intussusception. These involve enemas (contrast, saline, or air) and some method of visualization ( fluoroscopy or ultrasonography). Choice of technique is often institutiondependent. However, the combination of warmed saline enemas and ultrasonography offers the advantage of excel- lent visualization along with avoidance of ionizing radia-tion. Chances of successfully reducing an intussusception depend on many factors, including the length of time that the symptoms have been present, the age of the patient, whether there is a lead point, and the location of the intussusception. If a reduction attempt is only partially successful and the patient remains stable, at least 3 non- surgical reductions can be tried before resorting to surgery. The unstable patient should go directly to surgery. Non- surgical reduction is successful approximately 80% of thetime. Perforation occurs in less than 1% during nonsurgical reductions. (7) CHOLECYSTITIS, CHOLELITHIASIS, CHOLEDOCHOLITHIASIS Gallbladder disease in children is being diagnosed and treated with increased frequency. This increase is partlydue to greater awareness and partly to the epidemic of childhood obesity (Tables 4 and 5). Cholelithiasis and gall- bladder sludge was documented in 2.36% of children undergoing abdominal ultrasonography for any reason. (8) Factors that are known to predispose to gallbladder disease include total parenteral nutrition (TPN), hemolytic diseases, brosis, increased estrogen (preg- nancy or oral contraception), a positive family history, and obesity. Interruption of the enterohepatic circulation can lead to gallstone formation, as in Crohn disease with ileal involvement and short small bowel with ileal resection. There is a racial (Amerindian) and a genetic predisposition to the development of gallstones. The composition of gall- stones in children is different from that in adults. Classi- cally, gallstones have been categorized as cholesterol stones TABLE 2.

Pigmented stones are subdivided into black stones and brown stones. Gallstones are seldom, if ever, pure. Cholesterol stones (which predominate in adults) are composed of only 50% cholesterol. The re- mainder is made up of glycoprotein and calcium salts.Cholesterol stones are associated with obesity and cysticbrosis and are less frequent in children than in adults. Black pigment stones are more common in children than in adults and are associated with hemolytic disease and TPN. Calcium carbonate stones (associated with systemic disease) and brown pigment stones (associated with bacterial infec- tion) can occur in children. The presentation of cholelithi- asis and cholecystitis in children is variable and less speci c than the presentation in adults. Although in adults thecombination of right upper quadrant pain with vomiting exacerbated by eating fatty food is suggestive of cholelithi- asis, children may present with merely nonspeci c, poorly localized pain. The classic presentation of cholecystitis in adults of right upper quadrant pain, vomiting, fever, and leukocytosis may not be present in children or may be ob- scured by other ndings. Although biliary pain is described as colicky, this is a misnomer as the pain is usually perceived as\"constant \"by both adults and children. The evaluation of a child suspected of having gallbladder disease should include a WBC count, in flammatory markers sedimentation rate and CRP), functiontests, amylase, and lipase. Imaging should be performed inany child with a suggestive history and/or physical exam- ination ndings, even if the laboratory test results are normal. Abdominal ultrasonography has a better than90% accuracy for diagnosing cholelithiasis, (9) where stones show up as movable masses (in contradistinction to gallbladder polyps) of variable ultrasonography, gallstones cast \"shadows \"that are pathognomonic. Gallblad- der a frequent incidental nding on abdominal ultrasonography (1.46% of abdominal ultrasonography in children [8]). The signi cance of sludge is not clear. Some believe that sludge is a precursor to stones, and others believe that it has no long-term signi cance. Gallbladder wall thickening indicative of cholecystitis is less speci c and can occur in hepatitis and with generalized edema. Gall- bladder wall thickening should be interpreted in the context of other ndings. Abdominal ultrasonography can assess intrahepatic and extrahepatic ducts, pancreas, and adjacentstructures. HIDA scans are as accurate as ultrasonography in diagnosing cholecystitis. HIDA stands for hydroxyimi- nodiacetic acid, a radiopharmaceutical tracer that is nolonger used for the scan, but the name has remained. A HIDA scan is performed by administering the radiotracer intravenously. The tracer is taken up by the liver and excreted via the biliary ducts. It shows up in the gallbladder within 1 to 4 hours. From a practical point of view, HIDA scans are not used for the diagnosis of cholecystitis because they require advanced planning and are not readily available. The HIDA scan does measure gallbladder excretion. Biliary TABLE 4.

Many children who undergo cholecystectomy for a decreased ejection fraction have postoperative recur- rence of symptoms, bringing into question whether the gallbladder dysfunction was the true cause of the pain. (10) Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is diagnostically useful in older children and teenagers. It has the distinct advantage that it can be therapeutic for common duct stones. (It can remove stones in bile ducts, stretch bile duct strictures, and place stents across a strictured area.) It is seldom performed in young children because the endo- scopes are too large and pediatric endoscopists lack the skillto perform this procedure. Postprocedure pancreatitis is not uncommon. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatogra- phy has become increasing useful in complicated biliary disease as the quality and resolution of the technique has improved. It is as sensitive, perhaps more sensitive, than ultrasonography for the diagnosis of cholecystitis. It avoids radiation but usually requires sedation. It is not universally available. Management of gallbladder disease varies with the age of the patient and the type of disease. In neonates with stonesand no cystitis, symptomatic management and observation is usually adequate. Resolution without intervention can be expected. Resolution of stones associated with TPN may occur spontaneously. In older children the stones are unlikely to resolve without treatment. Autopsy data show that many people live and die with gallstones that never became symptomatic. For those found to have asymptom- atic gallstones, elective removal is safe and simple, so cholecystectomy is a reasonable option in those who are at high risk for developing symptoms. Cholecystectomy forgallstones in hemolytic diseases, such as sickle cell disease and spherocytosis, is mandatory. De nitive surgery can usually be performed as an elective procedure. Acute cholecystitis presents a more critical and more dangerous scenario. Presentation is characterized by severeright upper quadrant pain, sometimes radiating to the back. Vomiting is often present. Fever and jaundice occur in approximately one-third of affected children. Infl amma- tion of the gallbladder adjacent to the serosa gives rise to a Murphy sign, which is severe, sharp pain with cessation of breathing on palpation of the right upper quadrant. Chil- dren with acute cholecystitis should be hospitalized, made nil per os, and administered intravenous fluids and pain medications. Consideration of intravenous antibiotics shouldbe given, especially in the face of persistent fever. Laparoscopic removal of the gallbladder should occur when the child is stabilized.PANCREATITIS The apparent incidence of acute pancreatitis in children is rising; however, it is not clear whether this is a true increase or more awareness. In the United States, a rate of 13.2 cases per 100,000 children per year is reported, whereas only 3.6 cases per 100,000 children per year are reported in Australia (Table5). (11)(12) Pancreatitis in adults and children probably sharethe same nal pathway, but the initiating events differ. Gallstones and alcohol are the common underlying factorsin pancreatitis in adults. In children, for one-third of cases noetiology is found. Systemic illness, biliary diseases, medica-tions, trauma, and suspected infection account for most underlying etiologies. In addition, only 10% of childhood pancreatitis will progress to recurrent or chronic pancreatitis. Any of the underlying etiologies mentioned (and perhaps others) can lead to pathologic activation of calcium signaling inthe acinar cells of the pancreas tha t triggers intracellular activa- tion of proteases. Predominantly, trypsinogen is converted to the active trypsin. This cascade l eads to cytokine release, in flamma- tion, edema, and cell enzyme (SPINK1). The titis is based on presenta- tion, biochemical pro le, and imaging. The International Study Group of Pediatric Pancreatitis: In Search for a Cure (INSPPIRE) listed guidelines for diagnosis, which includeclinical ndings of abdominal or back pain, nausea and vomit- ing, amylase or lipase levels gre ater than 3 times the upper limit of normal, and imaging ndings consistent with pancreatitis. (13) Care must be exercised when eliciting and interpretingclinical ndings. Epigastric pain is the most common nding, but diffuse abdominal pain is not uncommon in children.Infants and toddlers frequently do not have abdominal pain butfrequently have fever and abdominal distention. Back pain,despite the fact that it is one of t he classic symptoms, is rare. Likewise, ecchymosis of the flank (Grey sign) is almost never present. Nonverbal patients may not be able to indicate abdom-inal pain and may well be taking medications known to beassociated with pancreatitis, such as valproic acid. The imaging study of choice is controversial. Ultraso- nography is almost always the rst imaging study per- formed because it is readily available, avoids radiation,and gives information about the pancreas and about sur-rounding structures and other causes of pain. It is the besttest to identify stones. However, obesity and bowel gas can limit assessment of the pancreas itself. The CT scan gives different information. It is the best test for assessing the complications of pancreatitis, such as hemorrhage, 134 Pediatrics in Review by guest on March 5, 2019 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from necrosis, and pseudocyst formation. (14) For this reason, it is frequently performed several days into treatment, whencomplications are suspected. There is not suf cient infor- mation on MRI for acute pancreatitis; however, with improv-ing technology, it may become an option. Other imaging studies used to further delineate causes of pancreatitis, such as magnetic resonance cholangiopancrea- tography, endoscopic ultrasonography, and ERCP, do not play a role in the diagnosis and treatment of acute pancre- atitis except that ERCP is curative for pancreatitis due to a stone obstructing the common duct. In trauma-induced pan- creatitis, ERCP can demonstrate the extent of ductal damage. The treatment of acute pancreatitis consists of 3 elements: 1) pain management, 2) fluid management, and 3) nutrition. Morphine is the most widely used pain medication for acute pancreatitis in children, despite the concern that morphine might induce sphincter of Oddi spasm, thus worsening the pancreatitis. Narcotic-sparing medication and nerve blocks have been tried in adults, but there is no experience in children. Fluid therapy should be early and aggressive. During the rst 24 hours, 2 to 3 times maintenance fluids should be administered. In the past, patients with acute pan creatitis were allowed nothing by mouth and often had a nasogastric tube placed and stomach contents suctioned. Patients often received intravenous nutri- tion. More recent studies have demonstrated that there is no need to avoid using the gastrointes tinal (GI) tract for nutrition. Children with mild pancreatitis can be allowed a low-fat dietfrom the beginning of therapy. In more severe cases, nasogastric or nasojejunal feeding can be instituted within the rst few days. Antibiotics are not recommended as a routine therapy, even in severe pancreatitis; however, if superinfection is suspected, cultures should be obtained and broad spectrum antibiotics used until culture results can allow narrowingthe antibiotic coverage. For adults with acute pancreatitis, there are several scoring systems to predict the severity of the disease, including the Ranson criteria, the modi ed Glasgow scale, and the Apache II index. None of these are applicable topediatric disease. In fact, there is no clear de nition of what constitutes severe acute pancreatitis in a child. (15) MALROTATION AND VOLVULUS Midgut volvulus is a true surgical emergency. The time from therst signs of obstruction to necrotic bowel requiring resection can be a few hours. If resection of necrotic bowelbecomes necessary, the bowel removed can include the small bowel from the duodenojejunal junction to the mid-transverse colon, including the ileocecal valve and cecum (the distribution of the superior mesenteric artery).A child who undergoes surgery of this extent will have extreme short bowel syndrome and interruption of the enterohepaticcirculation. With only a few centimeters of small bowel remain- ing, the child will almost certainly be dependent on parenteral nutrition, and there is a high probability that a small-bowel transplant will become necessar y. Small-bowel volvulus com- monly (45%) occurs in the context of intestinal malrotation.Malrotation is the failure of the normal rotation and xation of the bowel during organogenesis. The result is a cecum that isfree to fold and unfold on itself, usually in the right upper quadrant. This folding and unfolding can lead to intermittent symptoms of obstruction and pain. Ladd bands extend from the cecum to the abdominal wall, crossing the duodenum. Therecan be duodenal obstruction from these bands. In malrotation, the small bowel is located on the right side of the abdomen, resulting in a narrow mesenteric r oot. This allows the intestine to twist around the mesentery, compromising the superior mes-enteric artery with subsequent ischemia and bowel death. Volvulus of the small bowel can be due to adhesions or bands (30%), Meckel 's diverticulum, or idiopa thic. (16) Rotational abnormalities are thought to be present in 1 of 100 to 1 of3,000 live births. However, the true incidence is not knownbecause many are asymptomatic. Of the intestinal rotation abnormalities that come to medical attention, half will be found before a month of age and 90% will be diagnosed before a year (Table 1). However, midgut volvu lus can occur at any age, so most surgeons will perform the Ladd pr ocedure to alleviate intestinal m a l r o t a t i o nw h e na ni n c i d e n t a l malrotation is discovered. The diagnosis of small-bowel volvulus depends on a high index of suspicion. The most consistent nding is bilious and nonbilious vomiting. Abdominal distention may or may not bepresent. Abdominal pain is an inconsistent symptom. Labora- tory abnormalities are not speci c to volvulus but include leukocytosis, elevated CRP levels, and hyponatremia. The imaging study of choice is the con trast upper GI series, which is 96% sensitive and demonstrate s abnormal positioning of the third and fourth portion of the duodenum in malrotation and the \"corkscrew \"s i g nw h e nm i d g u tv o l v u l u si sp r e s e n t .U l t r a - sonography has not replaced the upper GI series, althoughthe midgut volvulus ndings on ultrasonography include the \"whirlpool\" sign and inversion of the superior mesenteric artery and vein, with the superior mesenteric vein on the leftanterior side of the superior mesenteric artery instead of its usual right side location. These ultrasonography ndings are not as consistent as the upper GI series ndings. (17) Management of midgut volvulus is to proceed to correc- tive surgery as quickly as feasible. Initial therapy includesfluid resuscitation, evacuation of the stomach via nasogas- tric suctions, and broad spectrum antibiotics followed bydenitive surgery. In one serie s, the resection rate was Vol. 39 No. 3 MARCH 2018 135 by guest on March 5, 2019 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from 44.9%, and 14.3% had postoperative complications, includ- ing short bowel syndrome, adhesions, intra-abdominalabscess, and failure to thrive. (16) CONSTIPATION Constipation is the most frequently identi ed cause of acute abdominal pain. It is not a medical emergency, but it oftenpresents as such. Importantly, constipation causing a picture of acute abdominal pain almost ce rtainly has been present for months, if not years. A careful history will reveal that such achild with constipation has a long history of dif culty defecat- ing, with infrequent bowel movements. Bowel movements may be large and hard or small and pebbly. The bowel movements may be painful, and withholding behavior may be present. A history of daily soft-to-loose bowel movements does not exclude the possibilit y of constipation because con- stipation with overfl ow may be present. Physical examination may reveal multiple fecal mass es felt through the abdominal wall; sometimes a single, larg em a s si sp a l p a b l ei nt h es u p r a - pubic area. A DRE may reveal har d stool in the rectal vault, or t h ev a u l tm a yb ee m p t y ,a si nt h ec a s eo fH i r s c h s p r u n gd i s e a s e . Constipation has many etiologies (Table 6), but by far the most common is functional constipation, which is present in 0.7% to 29.6% of children. (18) Functional constipation is de ned by the Rome III criteria; (19) however, just as useful is the workingdenition \"infrequent passage of hard, uncomfortable stools that are distressing to the child. \"(20) Acute abdominal pain caused by constipation is due to retention of fecal material anywhere in the colon. The pain ispoorly localized, usually nonradiating. Mild tenderness to pal- pation is commonly present. His tory and physical examination should suggest constipation, but laboratory investigation andimaging are frequently necessary to exclude other diagnoses. In the constipated child, WBC cou nt, CRP level, and electrolyte levels will be normal. Ultrasonography will not demonstrate appendicitis. The usefulness of an abdominal radiograph to diagnose constipation is questionable, (21) but it may be useful as a baseline in determining the results of treatment. In the absence of obstruction (constipation rarely, if ever, causes complete obstruction), t he current recommendation for acute abdominal pain due to con stipation is to administer large-volume osmotic laxatives (lactulose or polyethylene glycol 3350) enterally, by mouth, or by nasogastric tube. Enemas are not recommended because they will not cleanse the entire colon and are not well tolerated. An abdominal radiograph canensure that the colon is substantially free of fecal material. If not, a repeated colon cleanse is required. After evacuation of the colon, a maintenance regimen of daily stool softeners, daily toilet sitting, and improved diet is initiated. CONCLUSION Acute abdominal pain in childhood is a frequent and challenging clinical symptom. The diagnoses are many and vary in severity,evaluation, and outcome. The clinician must exercise acumen to arrive at the correct diagnosis and must remain vigilant to identify the child who requires immediate treatment. TABLE 6.

One in a hundred children will experience at least 1 episode of acuteabdominal pain that will come to medical attention. However,most episodes are not emergencies. It is the rare episode that requires immediate and accurate action. (3) (Strength of evidence C. Observational study.) \u0081Acute appendicitis remains the most common surgicalemergency in pediatrics. Although serum markers are helpful, imaging, in particular point of service ultrasonography and targeted computed tomography (CT), has reduced the false-negative appendectomies to less than 2%. (5) (Strength of evidence C. Observational study.) \u0081Improved imaging has changed the course of a child with intussusception. Ultrasonography is close to 100% accurate, resultingin much earlier diagnosis. Incidentally, abdominal CT scanning and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have demonstrated that minor small bowel to small bowel intussusceptions occur frequently andare self-resolving.
