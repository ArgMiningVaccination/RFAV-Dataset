A doctor can advise on how to approach a kidney cleanse or detox regimen. The [kidneys](/articles/305488) are two small, bean-shaped organs located beneath a person's ribcage on either side of their spine. They act as a natural filtration system for the body and play a [vital role in](https://www.kidney.org/kidneydisease/howkidneyswrk): - removing toxins from the blood - balancing [red blood cell](/articles/319457), [mineral](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/vitamin-dosage), and [electrolyte](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/153188)levels - regulating [blood pressure](/articles/270644.php) - creating hormones Most people can keep their kidneys healthy by [staying hydrated](/articles/290814) and eating a [balanced diet](/articles/324093). However, some people may want to do a kidney cleanse. A kidney cleanse involves consuming specific liquids, foods, and herbs to help: - remove toxins from the body - promote better kidney health - reduce the risk of [kidney disease](/articles/172179) Kidney cleanses typically involve consuming a restricted diet for several days. In this article, we look at how to cleanse the kidneys, an example two-day plan, and the risks and considerations. Proponents of kidney cleansing say that certain foods, beverages, and diets can detoxify the kidneys and body. However, there is currently little scientific research to support these claims, according to the [National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH)](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/detoxes-cleanses) The following tips may help the kidneys remove toxins from the body, improve kidney health, and reduce the risk of kidney disease. Drink more water Drinking enough water can help prevent kidney problems, such as [kidney stones](/articles/154193.php). This is because kidneys filter waste products by secreting urine. If a person does not consume enough water, then their urine output will be low and waste products may build up in the body. According to the [National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/urologic-diseases/kidney-stones/eating-diet-nutrition) Drinking enough water is essential to a person's overall health, as it is crucial for: - digesting food - absorbing nutrients - getting rid of waste and toxins - keeping the skin healthy - performing a wide range of other bodily functions Reduce sodium intake The body needs [salt](/articles/146677) (sodium), but consuming too much can raise blood pressure, which can increase a person's risk of kidney failure, [heart disease](/articles/237191.php), and [stroke](/articles/7624.php). The [National Kidney Foundation](https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/sodiumckd) recommends people limit their sodium consumption to less than 2,300 milligrams (mg) per day. People can reduce their sodium intake by eating fewer [processed foods](/articles/318630) and choosing [low-sodium](/articles/low-sodium-diet) or sodium-free options. Make dietary changes Some dietary changes, such as eliminating or adding certain foods, may help boost kidney function. A person can try adding these [kidney-friendly limit or avoid](/articles/what-foods-are-bad-for-kidneys) include: - processed foods, such as deli meats [soda](/articles/is-soda-bad-for-you) - refined [carbohydrates](/articles/161547.php) [sugar](/articles/eating-too-much-sugar)and artificial sweeteners - excessive animal protein intake, such as [beef](/articles/315449), pork, and organ meat [high-sodium foods](/articles/foods-high-in-sodium) [alcohol](/articles/305062) [caffeine](/articles/285194.php) The above lists are general guidance. People with kidney disease should speak with a medical professional to determine the best diet for them. A person should consult a doctor before starting a kidney cleanse, particularly if they have kidney disease. Limiting the duration of cleansing programs to two days may also help reduce the risk of adverse health effects. Here is a 2-day kidney cleanse plan for people who do not have kidney problems. Day 1 On the first day of the cleanse, people can prepare the following three meals: Morning Start the day with an 8-oz glass of warm water containing 1 tablespoon (tbsp) of [fresh lemon](/articles/318662) juice. Breakfast For breakfast, blend the following ingredients to make a 12-oz smoothie: Lunch Eat a large mixed green salad containing: For the dressing, combine: - one-third cup low-fat [Greek yogurt](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323169.php) - 1 tbsp Dijon mustard - 1 tsp lemon juice - salt and pepper to taste Top the salad with sliced [almonds](/articles/269468). Dinner For dinner, make an 8-oz smoothie containing: - 1 cup [coconut water](/articles/318394) - 1 cup [blueberries](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/287710.php) - one-half cup [mango](/articles/275921.php) - 1 cup [kale](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/270435.php) - 1 tbsp lemon juice - 1 tbsp ground [flaxseed](/articles/263405) Day 2 On the second day, people can eat a more substantial lunch and dinner. Morning Start the morning with a cup of [green tea](/articles/269538.php) containing 1 tablespoon of fresh lemon juice. Breakfast Blend the following ingredients to make an 8-oz smoothie: - 1 cup [almond milk](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318612.php) - one-half cup [spinach](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/270609.php) - one-quarter cup mixed berries - 1 frozen [banana](/articles/271157.php) - 1 tbsp ground flaxseed Lunch Combine the following ingredients and then saute together in [olive oil](/articles/266258): - 1 cup cooked [brown rice](/articles/319797) - one-half cup cooked beans - one-quarter cup beans](/articles/285753.php) - one-quarter cup chopped [carrots](/articles/270191) - 1-2 tsp minced [garlic](/articles/265853.php) Dinner Make a vegetable soup using the following ingredients: - 1 [sweet potato](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/281438.php) - 1 cup carrots - 2 [celery](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/270678.php)stalks - 1 yellow onion - 1 cup tomato - 1 can of [kidney beans](/articles/320192.php) - one-quarter cup [parsley](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/284490.php) - 2 tsp minced garlic - 4 cups low-sodium vegetable broth Begin by heating the vegetable broth over medium heat. Chop all of the vegetables and add them to the broth. After cooking the vegetables completely, stir in parsley. Add salt and pepper according to taste. Kidney cleanse programs generally encourage people to consume more healthy foods, such as fruits and vegetables. However, there is little scientific research to support their beneficial claims. According to the [NCCIH](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/detoxes-cleanses) For example, the FDA filed a [warning letter](https://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/ucm603434.htm) [depression](/kc/depression-causes-symptoms-treatments-8933) and [migraine](/articles/148373.php) to [flu](/articles/15107.php) and kidney stones. Although drinking enough water is essential for health, too much fluid can reduce mineral concentrations in the body and lead to health complications. A [2018 case study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6368431/) [hyponatremia](/articles/323831.php), or low sodium levels in the blood, while performing a kidney cleanse. Hyponatremia is a serious medical condition that can lead to potentially life-threatening complications, such as swelling of the brain. Many kidney cleanses and detox programs also require a person to fast or severely restrict their calorie intake, which can lead to [headaches](/articles/73936.php), [fatigue](/articles/248002), and nutritional imbalances. People who wish to try a kidney cleanse should consult a doctor first and ensure they are consuming enough [calories](/articles/245588.php) and electrolytes to support their metabolism. What do you drink to flush out your kidneys? Drinking enough water per day is crucial to promote urination, through which the kidneys secrete waste products. It is recommended that people consume six to eight [8-ounce (oz)](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/urologic-diseases/kidney-stones/eating-diet-nutrition) How can I repair my kidneys naturally? Most people can keep their kidneys healthy by: - drinking six to eight 8-ounce (oz) glasses of water per day - keeping sodium levels below 2,300 mg per day - eating a healthy, well-balanced diet - exercising regularly If a person is experiencing [symptoms of kidney failure](/articles/327300), they should get immediate medical attention. This is a condition that needs medical treatment. If left untreated, it can be life-threatening. Kidney cleansing programs may vary considerably, but they often involve: - restricted diets - consuming lots of water, smoothies, and teas - taking herbal supplements Although proponents claim that these programs detoxify the body and promote better kidney health, there is little scientific evidence to support these claims. Most people can keep their kidneys healthy by eating a healthful, balanced diet and drinking enough fluid. "}
