Illinois uses the standardized data collection methods developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Cont rol and Prevention (CDC). These method also are used by the 47 states and New York City, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and the Great Plains Tribal Chairmen's Health Board (GPTCHB) participating in PR AMS. Data are collected through mailed surveys with telephone follow-up for non-respondents. A systematic st ratified random sample of approximately 200 mothers is selected monthly from a frame of eligible birth certifi cates. At two to six months after delivery, each sampled mother is mailed an introductory letter and a surv ey. A reminder letter and a second and third mailing of the survey are sent to those who do not initially resp ond. PRAMS interviewers telephone mothers who do not respond to any of the mailed surveys to administer the survey by telephone. Surveys are available in both English and Spanish, and telephone interv iews are conducted in both languages. In 2016, a total of 2,307 women were select to participate in the study; 1,382 women completed the survey. Data were weighted and are representative of the 12 month PRAMS-eligib le population of 146,451 recent mothers. Data collection during 2016 marks th e first year using the Phase 8 PRAMS survey. Data analysis reports include the survey questions so da ta users are aware of what was asked on the survey. Sampling Design A systematic stratified random sampling design is used to oversample low birthweight (less than 2,500 grams) births. The sample is stratified by low birthwei ght (less than 2,500 grams) and normal birthweight (2,500 grams or greater). The 2016 overall weighted respons e rate was 59.9%. The weighted responses rates by birthweight are low birth weight 59.9% and normal birth weight 59.9%. Weighting and Interpretation of Results Statistics in this report are based on weighted da ta. The weights were developed by CDC to adjust for sample design, non-response patterns, and omissions from the sampling frame. The final sampling weight used in the analysis of the survey data is the product of these three elements. Weighting is necessary to give unbiased estimates of population parameters. The percentages, 95 percent confidence interval s, and total estimated population affected were calculated using Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN\u00ae*) software. Estimates for response categories with small sample size (i.e., fewer than 30 respondents in the denom inator) are not reported due to possible imprecision and bias. PRAMS data are representative of Illinois resident women, age 14 years or older, who gave birth in Illinois to live infants. The sampling design is valid at the state level and not intended or developed to represent sub-state geographies or their populations without further ev aluation. The data are not applicable to all pregnant women. At the direction of IDPH legal counsel, women younger than 18 years of age were not asked questions about physical abuse.
