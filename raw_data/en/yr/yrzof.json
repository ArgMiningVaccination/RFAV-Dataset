Acupressure, the more than 5,000-year-old healing art of using the thumb and fingers to press on these key locations, is one of the most effective complementary modalities a massage therapist can employ. Acupressure can release muscular tension, promote circulation of both the blood and the body's vital energy (Qi) and enable the body to relax deeply. By relieving stress, acupressure strengthens the body's resistance to disease and promotes wellness. The Qi of the body is produced in the internal organs and circulated through the body in the energy channel system known as meridians (pathways). The meridians are extensions of the 10 internal organs and contain specific acupressure points along each pathway. The points are sensitive to bioelectrical impulses in the body and conduct those impulses readily. Stimulation of these points with pressure releases endorphins. Endorphins are the neurochemicals that close the \"gates\" of the pain-signaling system. The closing of these gates prevents painful sensations from passing through the spinal cord to the brain. Acupressure points can be located easily via anatomical landmarks that either lie underneath major muscle groups or near a bony structure. Points are located by proportional measurements called a \"cun\" \u2014 one cun is approximately equal to one thumb's width. In order to assure accuracy, the width of the recipient's thumb is the best determination of this measurement. After locating the point, the therapist stimulates it by pressing directly on the muscular knot of tension or directly into the hollow or indentation near the bone with the thumb or the fingers. Points that are painful when pressed are considered to be areas where excessive energy has accumulated. Points that welcome touch are considered to be areas of energy deficiency. Points are typically addressed bilaterally. John Hickey, author of the Institute for Integrative Healthcare's [Shiatsu Anma Therapy](https://www.integrativehealthcare.org/programs/shiatsu-anma-therapy-massage-ceu--E536.html) program, gives the following instruction for applying specific pressing techniques to acupressure points: \"Ordinary pressure is considered tonifying to the point and can be used in excess or deficient energy conditions. Locate the point and with moderate pressure, gradually press directly into the point with the thumb at a 90-degree angle from the surface of the skin, hold for a few seconds and then release, gradually. To address points that feel painful or excessive, perform a stronger more dispersing technique using the tip of the thumb and applying a deeper, stronger pressure to break up the excessive and stagnant energy in the point. Hold the point until the excess energy is released. To address energy deficient points, and to encourage more Qi and blood to the area, use the flat part of the thumb, relax the hands, and use moderate pressure on the point to draw energy into the area.\" The Chinese names (translated into English) assigned to the acupressure points on the meridians can serve as a powerful meditation tool and can help establish the intention of your work. By pressing a point, silently repeating its name, breathing deeply and visualizing the point's benefit, both you and your client can realize the full potential power held in each point. There are hundreds of effective acupressure points that influence the functioning of the body. Ten of the most common and useful points to facilitate health are described below: 1.

This pulsation is a good sign that circulation has increased. Start adding some of these highly effective points in with your massage routine, explaining to your clients what you are doing and why. Take care to avoid those points that are contraindicated during pregnancy on an expectant mother. The body's vital energies concentrate inward during a treatment, so to maximize healing, be sure to keep your clients warm and advise them to stay warm following a session. The body has many more effective acupressure points that can address different imbalances. There are specific points along either side of the spine which reflexively influence every organ in the body. Watch for a follow up article addressing these powerful points on the bladder meridian.
