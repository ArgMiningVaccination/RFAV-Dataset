PREREQUISITES FOR COURSE The course is designed to convey the complexity of tourism planning and development. NRRT 270 Principles of Natural Resource Tourism is a prerequisite for the course. NRRT 470 is strongly recommended as a prerequisite to this course. COURSE DESCRIPTION & OBJECTIVES This course examines the relationship among tourists, tourist developments and the planning of tourist attractions and services and products. It focuses on the planning of tourist resources and programs within a geographic region, as well as at a destination and site level. Planning tools and design concepts are reviewed and analyzed. A local and regional planning process in Colorado is applied through various examples and comparisons of successful planning prac tices. This course examines the role of sustainability in destination management and planning. Various national and international tourism and destination management organizations will be highlighted to demonstrate the evolving importance of tourism planning and management. The basic goal of this course is to develop an understanding of the importance, process, and complexity of tourism planning. The following specific objectives are addressed: 1) To provide students with an informational background in to urism planning. 2) To generate an awareness of the concerns of the travel and tourism industry and develop skills required to plan for solving and managing problems. To identify the roles of destination management organizations and planning processes to enhance the sustainable development of tourism. 3) To gain an understanding of the relationship among tourists, tourist developments and the planning of tourist attractions and complexes. Page 3 of 17 4) To apply the planning process to the development of an attraction s ite plan and a regional tourism plan for sustainable management 5) Critically understand the sociocultural (including political and governance elements), environment, economic, and climate change aspects of sound destination management TEXTBOOK / COURSE READINGS Required readings will be located on Canvas COURSE MATERIALS & EQUIPMENT All course readings are provided through Canvas. Equipment for this course include a steady internet connection, a working computer with programs able to access provi ded materials, write, connect with course instructors and colleagues online, and record video and audio presentations for project submissions. During remote teachings of this course, synchronous students must be present in class for the scheduled times with video cameras turned on. PARTICIPATION /BEHAVIORAL EXPECTATIONS Participation in all class activities is required. Please see details below. Please review the core rules of netiquette for some guidelines and expectations on how to behave in an online learning environment. COURSE POLICIES (LATE ASSIGNMENTS , MAKE -UP EXAMS , ETC.) Learning Process: Learning is a reciprocal process facilitated through the continual exchange of ideas and information between the professor and students. It is the role of the professor to inspire the student to learn through whatever medium is most effe ctive to the greatest number of students and it is the responsibility of the student to actively participate in the learning process with the professor, other students and the community. 1. All assignments are due no later than class time on the designated date. Homework is never accepted late unless a medical note is provided. 2. All assignments must be uploaded to the required Canvas folder. No email assignments will be accepted without prior permission. Page 4 of 17 3. The A.P.A. (American Psychological Associatio n) format must be used whenever referencing is required for assignments given. Failure to correctly utilize A.P.A. referencing style will have a negative impact on your grade. https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_style_introduction.html 4. Class participation will constitute 1 0% of your final grade. Attendance will be taken during each class session /day . Two class absences (for whatever reason) will be allowed. The third- class absence will begin to impact your participation grade. Any class absences during the Student Presentation segment of the course will automatically impact your final grade. Please provide medical notes if applicable and communicate with the GTA as soon as possible if you have participation challenges. 5. ROLE WILL BE TAKEN AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH CLASS. STUDENTS WHO ARRIVE AFTER ATTENDENCE HAS BEEN TAKEN (I.E. LATE) WILL BE CONSIDERED ABSENT FROM THAT DAY'S CLASS. When a student is late to class it disrupts the learning of other students in the classroom and the online environment. 6. There will be no excuse for missing an exam or presentation. No makeup exams or presentations will be given unless I re ceive a written note from a doctor regarding illness (vacation, flights, visitations, personal recreational travel, etc. are not valid reasons to miss class). 7. Topics for lectures may not exactly coincide with information in PowerPoints or on Canvas. It is imperative that you participate in class and take notes because this material will appear on future assessments. 8. The use of excessive technology (laptops, iPad , cell phones etc. ) aside from the device being used for online class) will not be permitt ed. Eye contact with the professor and student peers is expected along with verbal engagement while in the online class. All ringers must be muted, and technology must not interfere with class or other students learning. 9. IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STUDENT WHO MISSES CLASS TO OBTAIN CLASSWORK THAT WAS DONE DURING THEIR ABSENCE. It is recommended that you establish a \"study buddy\" system with your student colleagues. Please also contact the course Teaching Assistant. 10. Turnitin.com will be utilized for all research -based reports and projects. Turnitin.com is an online plagiarism prevention system. Students may be requested to submit their work in an electronic format to be submitted to Turnitin.com or asked to submit their work directly. 11. Students need to take care of restroom and food/snack breaks before and after class. An occasional need happens to us all. Constant up and downs are distractive to both the instructor Page 5 of 17 and your fellow classmates. No food consumption is permitted in class as it is distracting (beverages are permitted). Please ensure your cameras are on and your background is professional. Movement, background noise and signs of being disengaged are distracting to the instructor and other student. This will be accounted for in your participation grade. 12. Student must demonstrate professional communication skills while contacting anyone on behalf of this course (including the Professor or other students or community members). That means that written correspondences such as ema il should use a professional and respectful business tone including appropriate greetings and salutations .

Concisely and in your own words, summarize the content of the article C) Educational Impact (15 pts) a. How does this current event relate to the subtheme of your research ? b. Please use academic sources to prove that you u nderstand the relationship between the news article and sub themes in this course. D) Key Vocabulary ( 5pts) a. Clearly utilize at least three key vocabulary terms from the course lectures and discussions to demonstrate how this article is related to your researc h subtheme . UNDERLINE these terms E) How does this relate to your PLANNING SUBTHEME overall? (5pt) Homework Assignments (3pts each) Homework will be assigned throughout the course and will be submitted according to the due date within the assignment details . These assignments vary each week in content and requirements. Remember: NO homework is accepted late for any reason. Discussion Exercises (3 pts each) Discussion Exercises (DE) will be assigned sporadically throughout the course. Each DE assignment must be posted to the course website within the discussion group thread by Friday at 11:59 pm, MST. By Sunday at 11:59pm (MST) of each week, student must then comment on DE posts from at least two other students. Your initial post should be between 200 -400 words. There is no expectation on word count within responses. However, responses should highlight issue complexity by provide in- depth questions and commentary, differing perspective, and/or personal connections linked to course content. Plann ing Mid -term Project Proposal and Peer Evaluation: Student groups will develop a thesis statement, annotated bibliography and brief analysis of the destination management best practice. This best practice will also accompany a local Colorado destination that can benefit from a specific aspect of the best practice. An analysis of the current management strategy of the local Colorado tourism case study will be included. Each student Page 8 of 17 must also complete (in class) a written peer- review of another student's project proposal. *SEE THE RUBRIC: Your midterm grade is composed of the following three components: Paper submission (50%: if you submit a proposal you automatically earn 50%), paper quality (20%: see grading rubric below for this subsection), and the quality of your peer review (30%: see student evaluation form). For example, if you do not submit a peer review, the highest grade you can receive on your midterm is a 70%. Any student that does not submit a proposal individually (of the group proposal) will not be able to pass the midterm (we need each proposal from each student in order to facilitate the peer -review process). MIDTERM EVALUATION (per student NOT per group) 1. Identification of a best practice TOURISM PLAN (20%) 2. Completion of the midterm propo sal (Online Submission) (50%) 3. Robust completion of peer -to-peer evaluation form (30% Tourism Planning Final Research Term Paper Present a critical analysis of a master, award -winning tourism destination management plan (choose an international award -winning master tourism plan) . The master case study should be a worldwide best practice of a tourism plan. It is your research responsibility to identify a tourism plan that incorporates an aspect of your assigned sub -theme. Then, make recommendations about how some aspect of the international, award -winning master plan could benefit a destination in Colorado . Example s should be used to highlight how aspects of the master best practice tourism plan could contribute to improving the local example and connect using your sub -theme . In addition to the major emphasis on your sub - theme, i nclude descriptions of many of the following aspects of the master plan: the mission, sustainability aspects of environmental and social management, the award , visitor profile, geographical/cultural/environmental background information, product development, sales activities, marketing and promotion, alliances, and membership services. What can we learn from the international award -winning plan to benefit our Colorado destinations? This project will allow you to analyze and assess a region's tourism development potential and best practices in tourism planning and destination management. After an introduction and overview of general information about your plan and destination, your report is to outline the Page 9 of 17 importance of sustainable tourism planning and development including considerations of economic, socio -cultural, environmental and climate change. Describe the destination resources/assets (attractions both natural and man -made) and visitor base (geographic, demographic, psychographic factors), and make recommendations for future destination management and market opportunities for the Colorado destination that is in some way similar but not the exact same as the master best practice case study. The final report should include some important aspects of the strategic plan and situation analysis (market assessment, destination assessment, and competition assessment), identification of target markets, marketing objec tives and strategies, and an advertising plan for example. It is important to critically analyze the role of your sub -theme in the tourism plan. Your report should be approximately 15 pages long and include a minimum of 10 Q1 -ranked tourism journal articles using APA academic referenc ing (along with supporting websites, media articles, book references etc.). Tourism Planning Final Presentation A corresponding professional presentation will be presented along with the final report. The presen tation should cover the same information as the report but in a more visually engaging way (you are teaching the rest of the class about your research findings). The presentation should be approximately 30 -45 minutes along with a PowerPoint ( each group mem ber should speak for equal portions of time, a ll partners need to be seen/viewable during the presentation) and use of other forms of creative multimedia (some small part that you and your team members have actually filmed or created from photos from visit ing the Colorado and international site/ destination). Each student is responsible for completing an evaluation form for each peer presentation (this will count toward your participation and homework grade). COURSE CONTENT SCHEDULE This schedule is tentative and will change based on the needs of the class! ****Please note this syllabus is subject to change at any time based on the context of the group. Please take NOTES in class and check Canvas regularly. I recommend the development of a \"study budd y\" system so that you can check with fellow classmates about information covered in class should you be absent. Your final project group is a great opportunity to establish a study buddy.

ACADEMIC INTEGRITY & CSU HONOR PLEDGE This course will adhere to the CSU Academic Integrity/Misconduct policy as found in the General Catalog and the Student Conduct Code. Academic integrity lies at the core of our common goal: to create an intellectually honest and rigorous community. Because academic integrity, and the personal and social integrity of which academic integrity is an integral part, is so central to our mission as students, teachers, scholars, and citizens, I will ask that you affirm the CSU Honor Pledge as part of completing your work in this course. Further information about Academic Integrity is available at CSU's Academic Integrity - Student Resources. Page 14 of 17 UNIVERSAL DESIGN FOR LEARNING /ACCOMMODATION OF NEEDS I am committed to the principle of universal learning. This means that our classroom, our virtual spaces, our practices, and our interactions be as inclusive as possible. Mutual respect, civility, and the ability to listen and observe others carefully are crucial to universal learning. If you are a student who will need accommodati ons in this class, please contact me to discuss your individual needs. Any accommodation must be discussed in a timely manner. A verifying memo from The Student Disability Center may be required before any accommodation is provided. The Student Disability Center (SDC) has the authority to verify and confirm the eligibility of students with disabilities for the majority of accommodations. While some accommodations may be provided by other departments, a student is not automatically eligible for those accommodations unless their disability can be verified and the need for the accommodation confirmed, either through SDC or through acceptable means defined by the particular department. Faculty and staff may consult with the SDC staff whene ver there is doubt as to the appropriateness of an accommodative request by a student with a disability. The goal of SDC is to normalize disability as part of the culture of diversity at Colorado State University. The characteristic of having a disabilit y simply provides the basis of the support that is available to students. The goal is to ensure students with disabilities have the opportunity to be as successful as they have the capability to be. Support and services are offered to student with functi onal limitations due to visual, hearing, learning, or mobility disabilities as well as to students who have specific physical or mental health conditions due to epilepsy, diabetes, asthma, AIDS, psychiatric diagnoses, etc. Students who are temporarily disabled are also eligible for support and assistance. Any student who is enrolled at CSU, and who self- identifies with SDC as having a disability, is eligible for support from SDC. Specific accommodations are determined individually for each student and mus t be supported by appropriate documentation and/or evaluation of needs consistent with a particular type of disability. SDC reserves the right to ask for any appropriate documentation of disability in order to determine a student's eligibility for accommod ations as well as in support for specific accommodative requests. The accommodative process begins once a student meets with an accommodations specialist in the SDC.
