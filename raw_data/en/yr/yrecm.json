ACL/CDC partnership to increase access to COVID-19 vaccines for older adults and people with disabilities 2022 ACL awarded two grants totaling $125 million to rapidly increase the number of older adults and people with disabilities who have received the updated COVID-19 vaccine. Applications are due by Tuesday, December 6, 2022. The two grants have complementary, but distinct, areas of focus: - Option A ($75 million): Will establish and leverage partnerships and engagement with area agencies on aging, state No Wrong Door systems/aging and disability resource centers, centers for independent living, other ACL-funded disability networks, and other community-based organizations that serve older adults and people with disabilities. - Option B ($50 million): Will build and leverage partnerships with senior centers, community centers, and local community- and faith-based organizations that reach older adults and people with disabilities. Both programs will prioritize reaching older adults and people with disabilities who have been historically underserved and who face additional barriers to accessing vaccines, including but not limited to those who are from communities of color, LGBTQ+, Native American, live in rural areas, are at risk of institutionalization, low income, or have limited English proficiency. The grantees selected for each option will closely coordinate efforts to ensure their activities are complementary, rather than duplicative. For more information, read about [the two grants, one to USAging and the other to NCOA](/news-and-events/announcements/funding-now-available-vaccine-promotion-activities). 2021 On March 29, President Biden [announced several actions](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/29/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-90-of-the-adult-u-s-population-will-be-eligible-for-vaccination-and-90-will-have-a-vaccination-site-within-5-miles-of-home-by-april-19/) to expand access to COVID-19 vaccines, including an exciting [partnership between ACL and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/03/29/hhs-to-expand-access-to-covid-19-vaccines-for-older-adults-and-people-with-disabilities.html) (CDC) to increase vaccine access for people with disabilities and older adults. These grants will provide assistance with scheduling vaccine appointments, transportation to vaccine sites, direct support services needed to attend vaccine appointments, connection to in-home vaccination options, and education about the importance of receiving the vaccine to older adults and people with disabilities. In addition, these grants will enable the aging and disability networks to identify people who are unable to independently travel to vaccination sites and to provide technical assistance to local health departments on improving access to vaccines for people with disabilities and older adults. Approximately $5 million will fund national hotlines to connect older adults and people with disabilities with local disability and aging agencies that can assist with vaccine registration and provide services and supports necessary to get the vaccine. This funding will increase the capacity of the [Eldercare Locator](https://eldercare.acl.gov/Public/Index.aspx), a nationwide service funded by ACL that connects older Americans and their caregivers with trustworthy local support resources. It also will leverage the infrastructure of the Eldercare Locator to provide, for the first time, a similar service for people with disabilities. An additional $93 million will be distributed as follows: - State Units on Aging and Area Agencies on Aging ($50 million) - Aging and Disability Resource Centers ($26 million) - Centers for Independent Living that receive federal funding directly from ACL.

Beware of vaccination-related scams Scammers rapidly alter their tactics and adapt their schemes to the changing landscape, and we anticipate that they will leverage the COVID-19 vaccine to prey on unsuspecting people. Be vigilant and protect yourself from potential fraud concerning COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. Here are things you need to know about the COVID-19 vaccine: - You likely will not need to pay anything out-of-pocket to get the vaccine during this public health emergency. - You cannot pay to put your name on a list to get the vaccine. - You cannot pay to get early access to the vaccine. - You will not be solicited door to door to receive the vaccine. - No one from Medicare or the Health Department with contact you. - No one from a vaccine distribution site or health care payer, like a private insurance company, will call you asking for your Medicare number, Social Security number, or your credit card or bank account information to sign you up to get the vaccine. The Senior Medicare Patrol (SMP) is ready to provide you with the information you need to PROTECT yourself from Medicare fraud, errors, and abuse; DETECT potential fraud, errors, and abuse; and REPORT your concerns. SMPs help educate and empower Medicare beneficiaries in the fight against health care fraud. Your SMP can help you with your questions, concerns, or complaints about potential fraud and abuse issues. It also provides information and educational presentations.
