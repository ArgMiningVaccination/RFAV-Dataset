VACCINE INFORMATION STATEMENTMMR Vaccine What You Need to Know(Measles, Mumps and Rubella)Many Vaccine Information Statements are available in Spanish and other languages. See www.immunize.org/vis Hojas de vaccinated? Measles, mumps, and rubella are serious diseases. Before vaccines they were very common, especially among children. Measles t\u0001Measles virus causes rash, cough, runny nose, eye irritation, and fever. t\u0001It can lead to ear infection, pneumonia, seizures (jerking and staring), brain damage, and death. Mumps t\u0001Mumps virus causes fever, headache, muscle pain, loss of appetite, and swollen glands. t\u0001It can lead to deafness, meningitis (infection of the brain and spinal cord covering), painful swelling of the testicles or ovaries, and rarely sterility. Rubella (German Measles) t\u0001Rubella virus causes rash, arthritis (mostly in women), and mild fever. t\u0001If a woman gets rubella while she is pregnant, she could have a miscarriage or her baby could be born with serious birth defects. These diseases spread from person to person through the air. Y ou can easily catch them by being around someone who is already infected. Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine can protect children (and adults) from all three of these diseases. Thanks to successful vaccination programs these diseases are much less common in the U.S. than they used to be. But if we stopped vaccinating they would return. 2 Who should get MMR vaccine and when? Children should get 2 doses of MMR vaccine: First Dose : 12-15 months of age Second Dose : 4-6 years of age (may be given earlier, if at least 28 days after the 1st dose) Some infants younger than 12 months should get a dose of MMR if they are traveling out of the country. (This dose will not count toward their routine series.) Some adults should also get MMR vaccine: Generally, anyone 18 years of age or older who was born after 1956 should get at least one dose of MMR vaccine, unless they can show that they have either been vaccinated or had all three diseases. MMR vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Children between 1 and 12 years of age can get a \"combination\" vaccine called MMRV , which contains both MMR and varicella (chickenpox) vaccines. There is a separate Vaccine Information Statement for MMRV . 3 Some people should not get MMR vaccine or should wait. t\u0001Anyone who has ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to the antibiotic neomycin, or any other component of MMR vaccine, should not get the vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies. t\u0001Anyone who had a life-threatening allergic reaction to a previous dose of MMR or MMRV vaccine should not get another dose. t\u0001Some people who are sick at the time the shot is scheduled may be advised to wait until they recover before getting MMR vaccine. t\u0001Pregnant women should not get MMR vaccine. Pregnant women who need the vaccine should wait until after giving birth. Women should avoid getting pregnant for 4 weeks after vaccination with MMR vaccine.t\u0001Tell your doctor if the person getting the vaccine: - Has HIV/AIDS, or another disease that affects the immune system - Is being treated with drugs that affect the immune system, such as steroids - Has any kind of cancer - Is being treated for cancer with radiation or drugs - Has ever had a low platelet count (a blood disorder) - Has gotten another vaccine within the past 4 weeks - Has recently had a transfusion or received other blood products Any of these might be a reason to not get the vaccine, or delay vaccination until later. 4 What are the risks from MMR vaccine? A vaccine, like any medicine, is capable of causing serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of MMR vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. Getting MMR vaccine is much safer than getting measles, mumps or rubella. Most people who get MMR vaccine do not have any serious problems with it. Mild problems t\u0001Fever (up to 1 person out of 6) t\u0001Mild rash (about 1 person out of 20) t\u0001Swelling of glands in the cheeks or neck (about 1 person out of 75) If these problems occur, it is usually within 6-14 days after the shot. They occur less often after the second dose. Moderate problems t\u0001Seizure (jerking or staring) caused by fever (about 1 out of 3,000 doses) t\u0001Temporary pain and stiffness in the joints, mostly in teenage or adult women (up to 1 out of 4) t\u0001Temporary low platelet count, which can cause a bleeding disorder (about 1 out of 30,000 doses) Severe problems (very rare) t\u0001Serious allergic reaction (less than 1 out of a million doses) t\u0001Several other severe problems have been reported after a child gets MMR vaccine, including: - Deafness - Long-term seizures, coma, or lowered consciousness - Permanent brain damage These are so rare that it is hard to tell whether they are caused by the vaccine. 5 What if there is a serious reaction? What should I look for? Look for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high fever, or behavior changes. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination. What should I do? If you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other emergency that can't wait, call 9-1-1 or get the person to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your doctor. Afterward, the reaction should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (V AERS). Your doctor might file this report, or you can do it yourself through the V AERS web site at www.vaers.hhs.gov , or by calling 1-800-822-7967 . VAERS is only for reporting reactions. They do not give medical advice. 6 The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) is a federal program that was created to compensate people who may have been injured by certain vaccines. Persons who believe they may have been injured by a vaccine can learn about the program and about filing a claim by calling 1-800-338-2382 or visiting the VICP website at www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation . 7 How can I learn more? Ask your doctor. Call your local or state health department.

See www.immunize.org/vis Hojas de Why get vaccinated? Chickenpox (also called varicella) is a common childhood disease. It is usually mild, but it can be serious, especially in young infants and adults. It causes a rash, itching, fever, and tiredness. It can lead to severe skin infection, scars, pneumonia, brain damage, or death. The chickenpox virus can be spread from person to person through the air, or by contact with \u00c0uid from chickenpox blisters. A person who has had chickenpox can get a painful rash called shingles years later. Before the vaccine, about 11,000 people were hospitalized for chickenpox each year in the United States. Before the vaccine, about 100 people died each year as a result of chickenpox in the United States. Chickenpox vaccine can prevent chickenpox. Most people who get chickenpox vaccine will not get chickenpox. But if someone who has been vaccinated does get chickenpox, it is usually very mild. They will have fewer blisters, are less likely to have a fever, and will recover faster. 2 Who should get chickenpox vaccine and when? Routine Children who have never had chickenpox should get 2 doses of chickenpox vaccine at these ages: 1st Dose: 12-15 months of age 2nd Dose: 4-6 years of age (may be given earlier, if at least 3 months after the 1st dose) People 13 years of age and older (who have never had chickenpox or received chickenpox vaccine) should get two doses at least 28 days apart.Catch-up Anyone who is not fully vaccinated, and never had chickenpox, should receive one or two doses of chickenpox vaccine. The timing of these doses depends on the person's age. Ask your doctor. Chickenpox vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Note: A \"combination\" vaccine called MMRV , which contains both chickenpox and MMR vac cines, may be given instead of the two individual vaccines to people 12 years of age and younger. 3 Some people should not get chickenpox vaccine or should wait. People should not get chickenpox vaccine if they have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to a previous dose of chickenpox vaccine or to gelatin or the antibiotic neomycin. People who are moderately or severely ill at the time the shot is scheduled should usually wait until they recover before getting chickenpox vaccine. Pregnant women should wait to get chickenpox vaccine until after they have given birth. Women should not get pregnant for 1 month after getting chickenpox vaccine. Some people should check with their doctor about whether they should get chickenpox vaccine, including anyone who: - Has HIV/AIDS or another disease that affects the immune system - Is being treated with drugs that affect the immune system, such as steroids, for 2 weeks or longer - Has any kind of cancer - Is getting cancer treatment with radiation or drugs People who recently had a transfusion or were given other blood products should ask their doctor when they may get chickenpox vaccine. Ask your doctor for more information. 4 What are the risks from chickenpox vaccine? A vaccine, like any medicine, is capable of causing serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of chickenpox vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. Getting chickenpox vaccine is much safer than getting chickenpox disease. Most people who get chickenpox vaccine do not have any problems with it. Reactions are usually more liNely after the first dose than after the second. Mild problems Soreness or swelling where the shot was given (about 1 out of 5 children and up to 1 out of 3 adolescents and adults) Fever (1 person out of 10, or less) Mild rash, up to a month after vaccination (1 person out of 25). It is possible for these people to infect other members of their household, but this is extremely rare. Moderate problems Seizure (jerking or staring) caused by fever (very rare). Severe problems Pneumonia (very rare) Other serious problems, including severe brain reactions and low blood count, have been reported after chickenpox vaccination. These happen so rarely experts cannot tell whether they are caused by the vaccine or not. If they are, it is extremely rare. 1ote 7he first dose of MMRV vaccine has been associated with rash and higher rates of fever than MMR and varicella vaccines given separately. Rash has been reported in about 1 person in 20 and fever in about 1 person in 5. Seizures caused by a fever are also reported more often after MMRV . These usually occur 5-12 days after the first dose\u0011 5 What if there is a serious reaction? What should I look for?

See www.immunize.org/vis Hojas de www.immunize.org/vis 1 What is hepatitis A? Hepatitis A is a serious liver disease caused by the hepatitis A virus (HA V). HA V is found in the stool of people with hepatitis A. It is usually spread by close personal contact and sometimes by eating food or drinking water containing HA V . A person who has hepatitis A can easily pass the disease to others within the same household. Hepatitis A can cause: \u00b3\u00c0u\u0010liNe\u00b4 illness jaundice (yellow skin or eyes, dark urine) severe stomach pains and diarrhea (children) People with hepatitis A often have to be hospitalized (up to about 1 person in 5). Adults with hepatitis A are often too ill to work for up to a month. Sometimes, people die as a result of hepatitis A (about 3-6 deaths per 1,000 cases). Hepatitis A vaccine can prevent hepatitis A. 2 Who should get hepatitis A vaccine and when? WHO Some people should be routinely vaccinated with hepatitis A vaccine: $ll children between their first and second birthdays (12 through 23 months of age). Anyone 1 year of age and older traveling to or working in countries with high or intermediate prevalence of hepatitis A, such as those located in Central or South America, Mexico, Asia (except Japan), Africa, and eastern Europe. For more information see www.cdc. gov/travel . Children and adolescents 2 through 18 years of age who live in states or communities where routine vaccination has been implemented because of high disease incidence. Men who have sex with men. People who use street drugs. People with chronic liver disease. People who are treated with clotting factor concentrates. 3eople who worN with +$9\u0010infected primates or who work with HA V in research laboratories. Members of households planning to adopt a child, or care for a newly arriving adopted child, from a country where hepatitis A is common. Other people might get hepatitis A vaccine in certain situations (ask your doctor for more details): Unvaccinated children or adolescents in communities where outbreaks of hepatitis A are occurring. Unvaccinated people who have been exposed to hepatitis A virus. Anyone 1 year of age or older who wants protection from hepatitis A. Hepatitis A vaccine is not licensed for children younger than 1 year of age. WHEN For children , the first dose should be given at \u0014\u0015 through 23 months of age. Children who are not vaccinated by 2 years of age can be vaccinated at later visits. For others at risk , the hepatitis A vaccine series may be started whenever a person wishes to be protected or is at risk of infection. For travelers , it is best to start the vaccine series at least one month before traveling. (Some protection may still result if the vaccine is given on or closer to the travel date.) Some people who cannot get the vaccine before traveling, or for whom the vaccine might not be effective, can get a shot called immune globulin (IG). IG gives immediate, temporary protection. Two doses of the vaccine are needed for lasting protection. These doses should be given at least 6 months apart. Hepatitis A vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. 3 Some people should not get hepatitis A vaccine or should wait. Anyone who has ever had a severe (life threatening) allergic reaction to a previous dose of hepatitis A vaccine should not get another dose. Anyone who has a severe (life threatening) allergy to any vaccine component should not get the vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies , including a severe allergy to latex. All hepatitis A vaccines contain alum, and some hepatitis A vaccines contain \u0015\u0010pheno[yethanol\u0011 Anyone who is moderately or severely ill at the time the shot is scheduled should probably wait until they recover. Ask your doctor. People with a mild illness can usually get the vaccine. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant. Because hepatitis A vaccine is inactivated (killed), the risk to a pregnant woman or her unborn baby is believed to be very low. But your doctor can weigh any theoretical risk from the vaccine against the need for protection. 4 What are the risks from hepatitis A vaccine? A vaccine, like any medicine, could possibly cause serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of hepatitis A vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. Getting hepatitis A vaccine is much safer than getting the disease. Mild problems soreness where the shot was given (about 1 out of 2 adults, and up to 1 out of 6 children) headache (about 1 out of 6 adults and 1 out of 25 children) loss of appetite (about 1 out of 12 children) tiredness (about 1 out of 14 adults) If these problems occur, they usually last 1 or 2 days. Severe problems serious allergic reaction, within a few minutes to a few hours after the shot (very rare) . 5 What if there is a serious reaction? What should I look for? Look for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high fever, or behavior changes. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination. What should I do? If you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other emergency that can\u00b6t wait, call \u0010\u0014\u0010\u0014 or get the person to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your doctor. Afterward, the reaction should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (V AERS).
