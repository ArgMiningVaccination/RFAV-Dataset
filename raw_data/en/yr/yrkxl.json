Generally, it is a term used for alternative therapies that work with the \"life force\" or other subtle forms of energy. Energy medicine focuses on restoration and maintenance of health through establishing proper flow of energy within the body. This is accomplished through identification of energetic blockage, deficiency, or disturbance and subsequently through the application of a treatment to rectify the problem. The ultimate goal of treatment is to ameliorate energetic disease and thereby restore physical and energetic health. Chinese medicine is one such form of energy medicine which was developed approximately 4,000 years ago to balance the flow of Qi, vital energy, throughout the body via meridian pathways to manifest physical healing. This is accomplished through the techniques of acupuncture, acupressure, Chinese herbal medicine, Tui Na massage, as well as Tai Chi and Qigong exercises. A multitude of other energy medicine systems can be found in the health-care market developed by energetic adepts who are able to see and work with energy. There are numerous energy medicine techniques developed by physicians, nurses and other allied health professionals to elicit a healing response. Some of these techniques include laser therapy, light therapy, magnetic therapy, sound therapy, homeopathy, aromatherapy, flower remedies, energy psychology, Reiki, healing and therapeutic touch, applied kinesiology, hypnosis, and distance healing.
