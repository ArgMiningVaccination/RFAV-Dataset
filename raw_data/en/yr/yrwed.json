It's known for its wide range of functions. It is an endocrine organ that produces hormones and regulates the rate at which the body's various systems and organs function. It has an impact on vitality, immunity, and sugar regulation, and the gland also manages the body's development, growth, and metabolism. The thyroid gland shifts from the pharynx (part of the throat that controls both digestion and respiration) to its place beneath Adam's apple throughout embryonic development. Before understanding further how Thyroid related problems occur, first let's understand what Thyroid Gland is. The thyroid gland is a small butterfly-shaped gland located directly below Adam's apple and above the junction of the two collar bones. A normal thyroid cannot be felt. Only when the thyroid gland enlarges, you can notice it. The thyroid gland has just one function - to create thyroid hormones. Thyroid hormones are responsible for regulating the entire body's metabolism. The body's metabolism is the process that describes how the body uses energy. High sensitivity and modest changes in health and hormonal processes occur when the body does not produce enough thyroid hormones (i.e. they are in excess or very little). Every cell in the body is affected by this imbalance, including metabolism and repair.
