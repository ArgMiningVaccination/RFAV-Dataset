Germs can be bacteria, viruses, fungi or other microorganisms. Infections can begin anywhere in the body, multiply and then spread. When the body's immune system is strong, it can often fight the germs and stop the infection. However, cancer and treatment can weaken the immune system. Take steps to reduce your risk of infection during and after cancer treatment. TIPS FOR PREVENTING INFECTIONS If you have cancer, it is important to try to reduce your risk of infection during and after cancer treatment. The following are steps that you can take to help prevent infections. Hygiene and Personal Care Wash your hands often and thoroughly with soap and water, especially before eating or after using the bathroom. If soap and water are not available, use a liquid or gel hand sanitizer. Take a warm (not hot) bath, shower or sponge-bath every day. Do not rub your skin; pat it dry gently. Use unscented lotion, oil and/or lip balm to prevent and heal dry, cracked skin. Take care of your nails by keeping them short and dry. Avoid manicures, pedicures and artificial nails. Do not pick or pull at your cuticles. Use an electric shaver instead of a razor to prevent cuts. Use an extra-soft toothbrush to clean your teeth and gums. If you have a port or catheter, clean and care for it by following your healthcare team's instructions. Clean your rectal area gently but thoroughly after each bowel movement. Ask for medical advice if irritation or hemorrhoids are a problem. Check with the healthcare team before using enemas or suppositories. FAST FACTSCancer patients, especially those undergoing chemotherapy, are more likely to get infections because of their weakened immune systems. Cancer and certain cancer therapies can damage the immune system by reducing the number of infection-fighting white blood cells. Patients with a low white blood cell count are at a higher risk of developing infections, and these infections can be more serious and harder to treat. In severe cases, infections can lead to death. Avoiding Illness and Injury Avoid crowds. If you must be in a crowd, wear a mask, especially in waiting rooms. Avoid all people (including family and friends) who have contagious diseases such as colds, flu, coronavirus, measles or chickenpox. Ask your doctor what vaccinations you may need. Find out if you should avoid people who have recently received immunizations with \"live attenuated\" organisms or viruses. Wear gloves when gardening or cleaning up after young children or others, especially if you are cleaning up waste or bodily fluids. Avoid activities that put you at risk for cuts, burns or other injuries. Clean cuts and scrapes immediately. Rinse the wound under running water. Wash the skin around the wound with soap. To avoid irritation, don't use soap on the wound. For serious wounds, see a doctor. Talk to your healthcare team about your pets. Pets in good health can usually stay by your side during cancer treatment, but you may need to take extra precautions such as asking someone else to clean a cat's litter box or to handle animal waste. Keep pets up-to-date on vaccines and heartworm, flea and tick prevention. Do not adopt new pets. Avoid reptiles, chickens, ducks or rodents, which can carry salmonella and other germs.SIDE-EFFECT MANAGEMENT : Reducing Your Risk of Infection Food Safety Wash hands thoroughly before and after handling food.
