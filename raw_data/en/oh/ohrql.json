[12 Principles of Green Chemistry](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/greenchemistry/principles/12-principles-of-green-chemistry.html)can be applied to identify safer, more benign alternatives for specific chemicals and chemical processes. What is green chemistry? Green chemistry is the selection of less hazardous, more sustainable chemicals, and/or the design of chemical products or protocols involving chemicals that aim to reduce or eliminate the use or generation of hazardous substances. Did you know...? - Many toxic chemicals used in labs have less-toxic or non-toxic alternatives. For example, ethidium bromide can easily be replaced with a safer alternative. - Hazardous chemicals are also commonly found in many pieces of lab equipment. Traditional fluorescent light sources contain mercury, for example. - Sharing chemicals or contributing to a chemical inventory is a great way to reduce chemical use. - Green chemistry isn't just for chemists - anyone who uses chemicals should seek to reduce their exposure to harmful substances.
