Reiki is a type of wellness bodywork, often referred to as energy work, that originated in Japan. Reiki practitioners offer this traditional healing technique with the intent of manipulating the flow of energy through the client's body. Unlike massage, Reiki uses minimal \u2014 if any \u2014 pressure, focusing on stimulating energy flow rather than working the soft tissue and muscles. This movement of energy is done to improve mental, emotional and physical health. Reiki is touted for its stress relief and ability to ease tension. It can also improve mental clarity, release stress and tension, manage pain, or help with spiritual growth. It is said that Reiki practitioners act as a channel for a universal life force to help support a client's natural ability to heal. Reiki sessions often last 30 to 90 minutes, with prices varying based on session length, background and experience of the provider, and where you live. Nationally, the average price range for a Reiki session is [$60-$80](https://www.thumbtack.com/p/reiki-cost). What can be treated with acupuncture?

There are many proven health benefits of acupuncture, whether you're seeking short-term relief or need help with a chronic health condition. This alternative healing is likely why millions of adults nationwide get acupuncture treatments each year. Acupuncture provides pain relief, can help speed the body's natural healing process, and has also been proved to have positive outcomes on mental health concerns such as [depression](https://acupuncturenowfoundation.org/2016/03/one-two-three-four-how-many-sessions-more/). Acupuncture can also help relieve discomfort associated with chronic and terminal illnesses. For example, acupuncture has been proved to be effective in helping cancer patients manage pain, nausea and vomiting, fatigue, hot flashes, xerostomia (dry mouth), neuropathy (nervous system problems), anxiety, depression and sleep disturbances, according to [ Cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/acupuncture-pdq). Acupuncture is a safe and effective alternative to opioids and other pain medications, which not only are hard on the body but also present the risk of addiction. [The U.S. Department of Health & Human Services](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4036643/) found that people had less pain or were better able to manage pain when they received acupuncture as part of their health treatment. What is naturopathic medicine? Naturopathic medicine is classified as an alternative healing method, but licensed naturopathic doctors share some of the same academic background as conventional medical doctors and can often prescribe some medications. According to the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (AANP), naturopathic medicine is holistic care that addresses a wide range of problems including (but not limited to) allergies, chronic pain, digestive issues, hormonal imbalances, obesity, respiratory conditions, heart disease, fertility problems, menopause, adrenal fatigue, cancer, fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome. Naturopathic medicine aims to strengthen and empower the body and its organs to heal itself through low-force interventions. Here are some examples of the type of medical services often provided by naturopathic doctors, as cited by the AANP: - Clinical and laboratory diagnostic testing - Nutritional medicine - Botanical medicine - Naturopathic physical medicine (including naturopathic manipulative therapy) - Hygiene - Counseling - Minor surgery - Homeopathy - Acupuncture - Intravenous and injection therapy - Naturopathic obstetrics (natural childbirth) How does acupuncture work? Acupuncture works by restoring the body's natural healing powers. Acupuncture involves placing very thin needles into specific points on the body to influence the body's energy flow and help the body heal itself in a natural way. In traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture is linked to the belief that disease is caused by disruptions to the flow of energy (called qi in Chinese) in the body. The acupuncturist places whisper-thin needles into the arms, back, neck and other areas where the chi (or energy flow) has been blocked. The acupuncture needles stimulate points on or under the skin called acupuncture points or acupressure points, releasing this qi. These pathways \u2014 called \"meridians\" \u2014 become re-stimulated by the needles to bring blood and healing to the body. In Western medicine, acupuncture has been [proved to relieve pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4036643/) and help provide healing and relief from painful symptoms associated with everything from headaches to asthma to cancer. Western medicine sees the use of the needles as a way to stimulate the body's nervous system, thereby prompting healing. Is it safe to use acupuncture? The general consensus from doctors, researchers and government health organizations is that yes, it is safe to have acupuncture. As with all things, there can be some risks associated with acupuncture, but with proper attention to a few key details, your health should be in good hands when you receive treatments. The [National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/acupuncture/introduction#hed4) (a branch of the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services) states that \"relatively few complications from using acupuncture have been reported. Still, complications have resulted from use of non-sterile needles and improper delivery of treatments.\" Thus, the health risks associated with acupuncture are generally a result of human error (non-sterile needles and improper placement) as opposed to how acupuncture works in your body. Research your acupuncture provider to make sure they meet state regulations, and inquire about the use of FDA-regulated acupuncture needles. These are classified as medical devices for use by licensed practitioners, and the NCCIH states they are required to be manufactured and labeled according to certain standards (sterile, nontoxic, and labeled for single use only). Can naturopathic doctors prescribe medication? Licensed naturopathic doctors can prescribe some pharmaceutical medication. Naturopathic doctors complete academic training similar to that of conventional physicians: a bachelor's degree with a focus on pre-med studies, followed by a four-year residential naturopathic medical program whose first two years have a similar foundation to that of a conventional medical school. After completing their studies, they must pass a post-doctoral exam. Although licensed naturopathic physicians are able to prescribe medication, they usually focus on prevention rather than treatment of symptoms. A naturopathic doctor will offer a holistic approach to your care that encompasses your mental, physical and emotional health. While they will prescribe medication as needed to treat illness, they are also likely to be creating shifts in your lifestyle and nutrition to effect deeper changes in your body's response to illness. How does acupuncture work in the body? Acupuncture is a centuries-old traditional Chinese medicine practice that has been incorporated into mainstream Western health practices due to its proven healing powers. After a thorough health intake and diagnosis, acupuncturists insert hair-thin needles into targeted acupuncture points on the body. According to traditional Chinese medicine, energy (qi) channels (meridians) run throughout the body, and when any of these meridians are blocked the body suffers. Inserting acupuncture needles frees any blocks in the meridians and allows the qi to flow once more, enabling the body to come back into balance. According to the [American Academy of Medical Acupuncture](http://www.medicalacupuncture.org/For-Patients/Articles-By-Physicians-About-Acupuncture/Doctor-Whats-This-Acupuncture-All-About), the scientific explanation in Western medicine is that \"needling the acupuncture points stimulates the nervous system to release chemicals in the muscles, spinal cord, and brain. These chemicals will either change the experience of pain, or they will trigger the release of other chemicals and hormones which influence the body's own internal regulating system.\" Well-designed studies have found that acupuncture can help with conditions such as back pain, knee pain, headaches and osteoarthritis. Is acupuncture covered by health insurance? Acupuncture cost may be paid out of pocket by the individual, may be partially covered by an insurance plan, or in some cases may be entirely covered by a health insurance provider. Depending on the health concern you are having treated, the policies of your insurance provider, and whether you have received referrals from a physician, you may receive coverage for your acupuncture costs. If you currently have health insurance, the [U.S. Department of Health & Human Services](https://nccih.nih.gov/sites/nccam.nih.gov/files/Paying_for_CIH_Approaches_06-20-2016.pdf) recommends that you ask these questions to confirm who will cover the acupuncture cost: - Is acupuncture covered for my health condition? - Does acupuncture need to be: - Pre-authorized or pre-approved? If so, by whom? - Ordered by prescription? - Does acupuncture require a referral? - Do I need to see an in-network practitioner to have acupuncture costs covered? - Do I have any coverage if I choose an out-of-network provider? - What, if any, are the limits and requirements of acupuncture cost coverage? - How much do I have to pay out-of-pocket? HHS recommends that you keep copies of all communications you have with your insurance company, as well as keeping copies of letters, bills and claims. If you're in the process of selecting a new health insurance provider, HHS suggests you ask about coverage of complementary or integrative health approaches, and whether the provider offers any discount programs for acupuncture and other integrative health modalities. How long do the effects of acupuncture last? The positive effects of acupuncture may vary in length. Relief may be permanent, effects may be immediate but require regular sessions to maintain, or effects can occur cumulatively over a number of treatments. The health issue you're having treated, your overall health, and the measures you take to care for yourself after treatment can all have an effect on the duration of the effects. If you're in a lot of pain, healing from an injury or suffering from a chronic health condition, you may need more visits to see lasting results. For acute conditions you may need from one to three treatments to experience results, while chronic health issues may take six sessions or more. You don't need to be sick or have something wrong to get acupuncture. Acupuncture also helps with stress management, relaxation and keeping your body in good working order. Acupuncture cost will be affected by the number of sessions needed. Sometimes people will feel a little tired after a session, and sometimes the main symptom can be slightly aggravated for a temporary period \u2014 but that's the body's natural healing response and you'll see improvement after that. An additional advantage is that acupuncture does not cause adverse effects as prescription drugs can. "}
