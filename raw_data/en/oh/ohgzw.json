Natural vitamins are derived from whole foods and organic, raw ingredients. They contain naturally occurring cofactors, such as bioflavonoids found in vitamin C, notes the Vitamins and Nutrition Center. These cofactors increase the bioavailability of the vitamin as well as its nutrient absorption. Synthetic or artificial vitamins are created in a laboratory setting with isolated chemicals that mirror the naturally occurring vitamin. They contain binders, fillers, artificial colors and other preservatives that reduce the bioavailability of the vitamin. As a result, individuals who consume high doses of potent, synthetic vitamins that overwhelm the body condition it to extract less vitamins and nutrients from ingested foods. This results in enzymatic inhibition, an inability to optimize healthy vitamins levels, metabolic dysfunction and adverse health effects, according to the Organic Consumers Association.
