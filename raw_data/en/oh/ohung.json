For example: - Certificate (Cert) in Massage Therapy - Diploma (Dip) in Business Studies - Associate of Arts (AA) in Gender Studies - Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Spanish - Bachelor of Science (BS) in Chemistry - Master of Arts (MA) in Acupuncture - Master of Science (MS) in Physician Assistant Studies - Master of Business Administration (MBA) - Master of Hospital Administration (MHA) - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Philosophy - Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) - Doctor of Psychology (PsyD) - Doctor of Jurisprudence (JD) - Doctor of Medicine (MD) - Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) - Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine (NMD) - Doctor of Naturopathy (ND) In earning an academic (educational) degree, a person has earned the right to communicate that level of education to others with an academic (educational) title and associated post-nominals. No one can take away one's right to communicate one's earned academic (educational) degrees and associated post-nominal titles after one's name. A professional title and associated post-nominals refer to the title and associated post-nominals that a person uses to communicate to the public that person's job. A professional title and associated post-nominals may be unregulated or they may be protected by state law and restricted to only those individuals who meet qualifications for certification, registration, or licensure of a given profession. For example: - Massage Therapist (LMT) - Acupuncturist (LAc) - Physician Assistant (PA) - Philosopher (PhD) - Pharmacist (PharmD) - Psychologist (PsyD) - Doctor/Physician Doctor/Physician (DO) - Naturopathic Medical Doctor/Physician (NMD) - Naturopathic Medical Doctor/Physician (ND) If state law protects and restricts the use of a professional title and its post-nominal abbreviation to only those who meet qualifications for certification, registration, or licensure of a given profession, then only those who are certified, registered, or licensed to practice a given profession are able to use the professional title and its associated post-nominal abbreviation. The restriction of a professional title does not restrict one's ability to communicate to the public one's academic (educational) degrees and titles. No one can take away one's right to communicate one's earned academic (educational) degrees and post-nominal titles after one's name. Below are answers to frequently asked questions about NMD and ND titles in the USA. What is the difference between an \"NMD\" and an \"ND\" academic (educational) degree and title?2 Naturopathic medical schools that are accredited or provisionally accredited by the [Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME)](http://www.cnme.org/) offer a doctorate degree in naturopathic medicine and grant the academic (educational) doctorate degree title as either \"Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine\" (abbreviated \"NMD\") or \"Doctor of Naturopathy\" (abbreviated \"ND\"). Allopathic medical schools that are accredited or provisionally accredited by the [Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME)](http://lcme.org/) offer a doctorate degree in allopathic medicine and grant the academic (educational) degree title as \"Doctor of Medicine\" (abbreviated \"MD\"). Osteopathic medical schools that are accredited or provisionally accredited by the [American Osteopathic Association (AOA) Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA)](http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/accreditation/COM-accreditation/Pages/default.aspx) offer a doctorate degree in osteopathic medicine and grant the academic (educational) doctorate degree title as either \"Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine\" (abbreviated \"DO\") or \"Doctor of Osteopathy\" (abbreviated \"DO\"). What is the difference between an \"NMD\" and an \"ND\" professional title?3 The protected professional title of a naturopathic physician may be \"NMD\" (Naturopathic Medical Doctor/Physician) or \"ND\" (Naturopathic Doctor/Physician), depending on state law, and is independent of the academic (educational) degree title of a naturopathic physician. For example, a naturopathic physician may earn an NMD degree and represent its education with that title (\"Firstname Lastname, NMD\"), however, state law may require that the naturopathic physician use the protected professional title of \"ND\" (\"Firstname Lastname, ND\") in the context of communicating to the public that the naturopathic physician is licensed to practice naturopathic medicine. In most states with licensure of naturopathic physicians, professionally using \"NMD\" and \"ND\" are restricted to only those who have earned a \"Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine\" or \"Doctor of Naturopathy\" degree from a CNME-accredited or CNME-provisionally accredited school. An example of this in the context of another healthcare profession is that of a physician assistant (PA). A PA may earn a Master of Science (MS) degree in Physician Assistant Studies and thus have an academic (educational) degree title that looks like \"Firstname Lastname, MS\". Once the PA takes the [Physician Assistant National Certifying Exam (PANCE)](http://www.nccpa.net/pance-eligibility) and passes, the PA can then obtain licensure and use the professional title that looks like, \"Firstname Lastname, PA-C\". Thus, a PA can put either \"MS\" or \"PA-C\" after the PA's name, depending on if the PA wants to communicate academic (educational) degree title (MS) or protected professional title (PA-C). Another example of this is that of an acupuncturist. An acupuncturist may earn a Master of Science (MS) degree in Acupuncture and thus have an academic (educational) degree title that looks like \"Firstname Lastname, MS\". Once the acupuncturist takes the necessary National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM) examinations and passes, the acupuncturist can then obtain licensure and use the professional title that looks like, \"Firstname Lastname, LAc\". Thus, an acupuncturist can put either \"MS\" or \"LAc\" after the acupuncturist's name, depending on if the acupuncturist wants to communicate academic (educational) degree title (MS) or protected professional title (LAc). An allopathic physician earns an \"MD\" academic (educational) degree and the protected professional title in all states is \"MD\". There is no difference between the academic (educational) degree title and the protected professional title of an allopathic physician. An osteopathic physician earns a \"DO\" academic (educational) degree and the protected professional title in all states is \"DO\". There is no difference between the academic (educational) degree title and the protected professional title of an osteopathic physician. What are protected professional titles of naturopathic physicians (naturopaths)?4 Depending on the state and how legislation regarding naturopathic physicians was written, the following are all protected professional titles that are used to refer to naturopathic physicians: - Naturopathic Physician - Naturopathic Medical Doctor - Naturopathic Doctor - Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine - Doctor of Naturopathy - Registered Naturopathic Doctor - NMD or N.M.D. - ND or N.D. - RND or R.N.D. - Natureopath - Naturopath The variations in the title of a naturopathic physician from state to state can be seen in the legislation for each state that either licenses or registers naturopathic physicians. The protection and restriction of a professional title does not restrict one's ability to communicate to the public one's academic (educational) degrees and titles. No one can take away one's right to communicate one's earned academic (educational) degrees and titles after one's name.
