Is. Agony.", "sitename": "SELF", "date": "2017-12-12", "cleaned_text": "I still remember the night I first pressed a fingertip covered in alum, a pickling agent often found in the spice aisle, onto a canker sore that had emerged on the inside of [my bottom lip](https://www.self.com/story/what-your-gums-say-about-health). Having been a health editor for some time, I've learned to be pretty skeptical of [home remedies](https://www.self.com/story/apple-cider-vinegar-health). But I'd stumbled upon tons of glowing reviews saying alum, or potassium aluminum sulfate, had helped people get rid of their canker sores ASAP. I hadn't had one in years, but it was so hideously painful I was willing to try anything to speed up the healing. (It also made it impossible to eat my beloved spicy food, because apparently nothing is sacred.) When I dabbed those coarse white grains onto the sore, my reward was searing, white-hot pain. There's no way this is worth it, I thought to myself, my eyes watering as my phone counted down from 100 seconds. But after spitting out the alum, I realized my canker sore was numb, which offered me a bit of blessed relief. And the next morning, my previously full-fledged canker sore was around a third of the size and didn't throb with pain each time I moved my lip. My canker sore then healed in about two more days instead of the week or so I'd been expecting. Impressed, I did some more digging. As it turns out, research hasn't proven that alum can accelerate canker sore healing for everyone across the board. Also, as my experience shows, this treatment can be so painful, it may not even be worth it for some people. Before making a beeline over to the spices, here's what you need to know. Also known as evil-sounding aphthous ulcers, canker sores are round or oval lesions that show up in the mucosa (delicate tissue) of your mouth. They have white middles, and their angry red edges are a clear sign of inflammation. Canker sores have no single proven cause, but a lot of potential factors, including an injury to your mouth, your immune system overreacting to said injury, [food allergies](http://www.self.com/health-conditions/food-allergies) or sensitivities, using toothpastes with sodium lauryl sulfate (it helps products to froth), nutritional deficiencies, and [stress](https://www.self.com/topic/stress), according to the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/canker-sore/symptoms-causes/syc-20370615). \"The lion's share of the population will canker sores,\" [Alexander R. Kerr](https://dental.nyu.edu/faculty/ft/ark3.html), D.D.S., clinical orofessor of oral and maxillofacial pathology, radiology and medicine at NYU College of Dentistry, tells SELF. In fact, around 80 percent of people will have at least one canker sore before they turn 30, according to a 2016 review in the [Journal of Clinical & Diagnostic Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5121828/) that reviewed over 50 pieces of canker-sore research. A random one-off canker sore typically heals within two weeks, [Erich Voigt](http://nyulangone.org/doctors/1851315147/erich-p-voigt), M.D., clinical associate professor in the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at NYU Langone Health, tells SELF. The only problem is that every second of those weeks can feel like torture. \"Then there are people who get much more frequent bouts of these oral ulcers,\" Dr. Kerr says. These ulcers can be large and take a month to heal or even longer, he notes. This is more likely to happen if you have a [health condition](https://www.self.com/health-conditions) that may predispose you to recurrent canker sores, like [Crohn's disease](https://www.self.com/health-conditions/crohns-disease), [ulcerative colitis](https://www.self.com/health-conditions/ulcerative-colitis), and the rare disorder Behcet's disease, which can prompt canker sores because of their connection with bodily inflammation. Conditions that can throw your immune system for a loop, like [celiac disease](https://www.self.com/story/non-celiac-gluten-sensitivity) and [HIV/AIDS](https://www.self.com/story/hepatitis-c-from-sex), can also contribute. Canker sore treatments typically come down to alleviating symptoms until your body can heal the ulcer. (And if you have an underlying condition that causes them, addressing that as best you can often helps, too.) Treatment can range from over-the-counter products with ingredients to address [pain](https://www.self.com/health-conditions/pain-management) and inflammation to prescription steroid drugs, according to the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/canker-sore/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20370620). And, while there's no official proof that alum works, there's a fair amount of anecdotal evidence about this treatment method floating around. Unfortunately, no. And finding this out for yourself will hurt. A lot. The unofficial (read: not sanctioned by actual medical experts or SELF, but available online) recommendation is to apply alum to your canker sore for anywhere from 60 to 100 seconds, not swallow (it tastes pretty terrible), then spit it out. This is theoretically supposed to help reduce pain and also speed up healing. While the science isn't totally clear on why this could work for some people, it may be that alum is an astringent (i.e., it makes bodily tissues contract) that chemically cauterizes the ulcer, Dr. Kerr says. This essentially means alum might close the ulcer by burning it, which may allow it to heal more quickly. If true, that would make sense, seeing as the Mayo Clinic lists cautery of sores via methods like the drug debacterol as one way of treating these ulcers (though it doesn't specifically mention alum). \"Chemical cautery, [like that which happens with] debacterol, hurts like crazy but seems to work very well,\" Dr. Kerr says. As another potential point in alum's corner, Dr. Voigt notes that it is sometimes used in devices like styptic pencils, or small medicated sticks that help to stop bleeding from things like shaving cuts. At the very least, it does seem to have some effect on wounds, though not one that has been investigated enough to hail it as the perfect canker-sore treatment. If only science had really thrown its weight behind this does-alum-treat-canker-sores mystery already. One small 2016 study published in [Caspian Journal of Internal Medicine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5062179/) did assume the mantle, analyzing whether patches containing 7 percent alum helped speed healing in a group of 50 women. While the average recovery time for the patches without alum was 12.2 days, it dropped to 7.52 days in the people testing alum's effectiveness. They also saw better reduction in size of the sores and severity of the pain. The study authors posit that alum prevents further swelling by strengthening blood vessels, and that it calms inflammation, too. They also noted that alum lowers the pH of the wound, which can help prevent bacterial growth that prolongs healing time. It all sounds promising, but this is nowhere near enough to declare that alum is the key to your canker sore woes. A lot more testing needs to be done. Alum might not be your wonder treatment. Or, if you're one of the lucky ones who tries this, can deal with the wallop of pain, and sees some results, it may. No matter which canker-sore treatment you turn to, it's best to apply it as soon as you even think you're starting to get one so you can \"nip it in the bud,\" Dr. Kerr says. If it becomes a full-blown ulcer, it's harder (and more painful) to treat. \"It's very tough to get a fast and effective treatment that is going to work every time,\" Dr. Kerr says. And if a canker sore is lasting for over two weeks or is affecting your quality of life even more than they usually do, see a doctor. It may need further evaluation, since oral cavity [cancers](https://www.self.com/health-conditions/cancer) can present with painful sores, Dr. Voigt says. It's more likely that you just have an annoyingly persistent canker sore, but always worth getting a second opinion, just "}
