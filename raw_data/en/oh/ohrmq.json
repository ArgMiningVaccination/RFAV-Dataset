Not a place for discussion of illicit and illegal compounds. So I get sick about once a month, really, really sick. Whether it be violent coughing, stuffy nose, fever, sore throat, or a combo. Currently I just have a sore throat. I take a multivitamin tablet, Vitamin D 5000 IU in a gel capsule, and a Iron chewable. I'm so tired of the doctor giving me an antibiotic every-time I see him when I'm sick. Please help me. Edit: Wow!! Thanks for all the advice everyone! I'm definitely going to see a new doctor and get some blood work done and take it from there. "}
