Orthomolecular practitioners may also incorporate a variety of other styles of treatment into their approaches, including [dietary](/en/Diet_(nutrition)) restriction, megadoses of non-vitamin nutrients and mainstream [pharmaceutical drugs](/en/Pharmaceutical_drugs). [[1]](#cite_note-isbn1-59120-226-4-1) [[9]](#cite_note-Braverman-9) Proponents argue that non-optimal levels of certain substances can cause health issues beyond simple [vitamin deficiency](/en/Vitamin_deficiency) and see balancing these substances as an integral part of health. [[10]](#cite_note-Singh2008-10) American chemist [Linus Pauling](/en/Linus_Pauling) coined the term \"orthomolecular\" in the 1960s to mean \"the right molecules in the right amounts\" (ortho- in Greek implies \"correct\"). [[11]](#cite_note-pauling1968-11) Proponents of orthomolecular medicine hold that treatment must be based on each patient's individual biochemistry. [[12]](#cite_note-Baumel2000-12) [[13]](#cite_note-autogenerated1-13) The [scientific and medical consensus](/en/Scientific_consensus) holds that the broad claims of efficacy advanced by advocates of orthomolecular medicine are not adequately tested as drug therapies.

[[14]](#cite_note-14) Proponents point to mainstream sources that have published research supporting the benefits of nutrient supplementation [[15]](#cite_note-15) [[16]](#cite_note-Gesch-16) and to instances where conventional medicine uses vitamins as treatments for some diseases. Some vitamins in large doses have been linked to increased risk of [cardiovascular disease](/en/Cardiovascular_disease), [cancer](/en/Cancer) and death.
