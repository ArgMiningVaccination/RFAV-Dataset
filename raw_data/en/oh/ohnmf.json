Downs Blvd. MDC 4130 589-7112 Education - PHD, Physiology/Psychology, University of Washington, 1971 Academic Philosophy \"Collaborate, collaborate, collaborate! With those around you, with those in other institutions, with those in other disciplines, with those in other countries, and with students/residents/trainees. All bring assets to any collaboration.\" Interdisciplinary and Emerging Signature Programs - Allergy, Immunology & Infectious Disease - Cardiovascular Sciences - Metabolic Regulation and Disorders Research Interests - Dr. Hansen is the Director of the Obesity, Diabetes and Aging Research Center of the College of Medicine and Professor of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics at the University of South Florida Tampa. Her research has addressed the physiological, cellular, and molecular defects underlying the development of obesity and diabetes mellitus and their prevention, as well as the long-term prevention of diabetic complications. Dr. Hansen has developed nonhuman primate models of obesity, the metabolic syndrome, diabetes and diabetic complications, and these models are applied to studies of the underlying mechanisms of these disorders, their natural history, and their mitigation/treatment and prevention by pharmaceutical and non- pharmaceutical approaches. Her research program has informed patient/human studies as well, for extension of non-human primate findings to human health and disease mechanisms is of greatest importance.
