Senior administration officials at the [White House](https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house) discussed new steps Monday to ramp up distribution capacity, which included nearly doubling the number of places oral antivirals are available, and the new installation of federally-supported test-to-treat sites. \"These actions will help strengthen and further build the infrastructure to ensure that lifesaving treatments for [COVID-19](https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/infectious-disease/coronavirus) are quickly distributed around the country, widely available and easy to access,\" the officials said. [COVID-19 SUBVARIANT XE: WHAT TO KNOW](https://www.foxnews.com/health/covid-19-subvariant-xe-ba-2-coronavirus-pandemic) \"To date, the administration has worked with pharmacies, long-term care facilities, community health centers, and other health care settings to establish more than 2,200 tests-to-treat sites around the country, including sites specifically for [military](https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military) families and veterans,\" the White House added. \"As a result, usage of oral antivirals has more than doubled over the last several weeks. But more is needed to make these treatments even easier to access and make sure health care providers and patients know about their safety, efficacy and availability.\" The White House also specified its intention to support medical providers with more guidance and tools to understand and prescribe treatments, and to communicate these new safe treatment options to the American people.

These pharmaceutical drugs will soon be available in more than 30,000 locations, a number the administration hopes to swell to 40,000 through a partnership between the Department of Health and Human Services and its pharmacy partners, it said. One specific oral antiviral the administration is looking to swiftly move into circulation is Pfizer's pill [Paxlovid](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-administration-pfizer-covid-antiviral-pill-doubles-purchase). The administration described the pill as \"the most effective available treatment... which has been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization or death by about 90%.\" \"The U.S. has committed to purchase 20 million treatment courses\u2014more than any other country in the world,\" it added. Next, the Biden administration also intends to expand federally-supported COVID-19 tests-to-treat sites, working alongside state governments, local health agencies, and their respective jurisdictions to ensure wide availability. \"These sites will be targeted to meet demand and increase equitable access to lifesaving COVID-19 treatment and will function in direct collaboration with state and local health agencies,\" officials said.
