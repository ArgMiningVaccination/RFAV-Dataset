The preference for alternative therapies, and herbal medicine were indicated, and the fear of relinquishing information regarding these practices were almost paralyzing. It seemed as though they were ashamed to admit to cultural healing practices, and did not divulge information to practitioners regarding their usage. The cultural disconnect was present as alternative/complimentary medicines are valued as a culture, and \"modern\" practitioners cast judgment on their usage. This perceived stigma additionally limited the information shared by the cultural participants with modern medical treatments, potentially causing additional harm, as some herbals are potentially toxic. Benefits of Alternative Medicine Alternative medicine believes in supporting the natural healing processes of the body. This means that helps a better functioning of organs, for example, it does not destroy the liver function, such as pharmaceutical products do. It means allowing the body to regulate their own cholesterol, blood pressure and brain chemistry in a healthy way of support. Introduction Today 's modern health care is ever evolving in its approach to health and care of a patient revolves around being culturally and ethnically competent in their treatment. In the United States (US), the growing aging population, brings an increasing public awareness of the major risk factors that are contributing to chronic illness. The availability of knowledgeable healthcare practitioners is also growing to meet the needs of this growing population. Complementary alternative medicine (CAM) is aimed to provide a multidisciplinary and educational health care experience. In this project, it will be explained about being culturally and ethnically competent and the use of alternative medicine as an adjunct therapy or a \"More than 500 types of alternative medicine exists, and thousands of treatment approaches are possible.\" (Billitteri, 9). If we have so many other options why are so many people relying on solely western medicine that can be addictive and make you sicker than you already are? Modern medicine has not always been around and sometimes people can't afford it so they have no choice but to use nontraditional medicine. Nontraditional medicine should be assimilated into modern medicine because people used it before we had modern medicine, they can not afford it, and prescribed medication can be extremely addictive. Because many of the treatments of alternative medicine do not adhere to the principles of conventional medicine, whether or not to allow practice of these techniques in the United States is a major concern of the medical community today. The Food and Drug Administration is the decision making body of issues such as this and more often than not, does not approve many of these practices. Due to the fact that holistic medicine sometimes contradicts the fundamentals of biomedicine, health care regulation boards such as the FDA find it difficult to accept many of these treatments. Because the Western world is so unfamiliar with these techniques it is only natural for medical community to often disprove these methods. However, as more and more doctors discover the limitations of Complementary and Alternative Therapy Non-pharmacological interventions can be a substantial way that nurses can positively impact adult patients with hypertension. The first complementary and alternative therapy treatment of guided imagery was given to a group of pregnant patients with hypertension. Guided imagery is a way to focus one's minds on a peaceful and calm place. In a life-threatening and serious situation, such as surgery or pregnancy, guided imagery could be a helpful non-pharmacological tool for a nurse to use to calm the patient. Results have shown a statistically significant decrease in blood pressure when guided imagery was used instead of just quiet rest. However, the findings show no significant effect of using guided imagery versus quiet rest on their anxiety level (Moffatt et al., 2010). Guided imagery can be beneficial as a nursing intervention for the appropriate patient. Using guided imagery along with the proper education can lead to better blood pressure reduction in hypertensive patients (Gignon et al., 2014; Moffatt et al., 2010). Policy statement Incorporate non-pharmacological complementary and alternative treatments with conventional medicine to treat complex chronic pain conditions as a collaborative and integral part of the health care system. A Paradigm Shift to Complementary and Alternative Medicine Over the last century, religion, spirituality, and science have all played a major role in health care, although they have never been integrated with traditional medical science in the United States. Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) is a set of medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not part or integrated as part of Western medicine which is the dominant health care system in the United States. Religion and spirituality have both played dominant roles in healing since the beginning of history. Today it is believed that prayer and faith can bring healing and is referred to as holistic healing, or focus on the mind, body, and spirit rather The first reason for supporting alternative medicine is because it's effective. In fact, Traditional Chinese medicine has been used for more than 5,000 years with proof of its effectiveness (Sutton, 2010, 95). In addition, TCM has punch of methods for treating patient's widely such as herbs and other (Sutton, 2010, 94-95). That means alternative medicine has proved its worth and won people's respect. It is true, alternative medicine is growing within the scientific community. If you think about it, all of the medical research at one point was an alternative or uncharted territory of medicine. Maybe soon, the alternative methods will be the new standard with research to back it up. Even To The Editor: You raised a number of issues in the Science and Technology article concerning \"Public Attitudes and Public Understanding\" regarding pseudoscience and belief in alternative medicine in Science Fiction and Pseudoscience. I would like to rebuttal the statement \"Alternative seems to define a culture rather than a field of medicine\u2014a culture that is not scientifically demanding\". As Contemporary Alternative Medicine (CAM) usage is increasing worldwide, there are many different types of CAM therapies being used mind-body medicine (e.g. yoga, meditation, mental healing) biologically based practices (e.g. herbal and Ayurvedic), energy medicine (e.g. reiki, therapeutic therapies) and manipulative body-based medicine (e.g. chiropractic, The medical world is the number one industry in the world. We, as a society, are reliant on medicine, surgeries, chemotherapy, and other treatments to help save us from whatever illnesses we are facing. We take a pill for something as little as a headache to taking painkillers to relieve By examining some of the most popular, enduring alternative medical systems, one can begin to see some general trends of the systems, understand some recurring flaws, and understand the attraction and usefulness of alternative medicine in today's health care system. However, alternative medicine remains controversial. Whether it can be supported scientifically or not, alternative medicine may be useful to encourage both physical and mental well-being via a placebo effect. For this reason, alternative medicine must be considered by physicians as a complement to modern medicine. Many doctors see alternative therapies as only a joke in the medical field. New ideas and procedures without surgery or the use of medication are being portrayed as fake, unneeded and ineffective. Many are not considered serious medicine by the medical field specialists. There has to be another way to help heal the body instead of cutting patients open, or shoving all types of medications into patient's bodies. Although alternative therapies are not taken seriously by doctors, the therapies are becoming increasingly more popular each day. Society is looking for better and more practical ways to achieve healthier lifestyles. Many patients are interested in new and safer ideas to stay healthy. Information regarding alternative therapies These therapies have proved to be of much benefit in supporting the normal healing course of the body. Even though there are many modern alternative remedies, with different beliefs, all of them operate under some common principles. One of these principles is that the body has the capacity to heal naturally and maintain stability (Paquette, 2000). The other one is that adverse health conditions can occur as a result of factors emanating from mind, emotions and the body. Alternative medicine, according to Goldberg, Trivieri and Anderson, (2002), focuses on determining the chief cause of a particular condition, and dealing with the whole person rather that concentrating on symptoms. If a person pays close attention to his/her health he/she can contribute to his/her wellbeing. Alternative medicine holds firmly to the principle that one treatment cannot be used for all people even though they may be suffering from the same condition. Each and every person as per alternative medicine has distinct bodily, mind and spiritual make up (Goldberg, Trivieri and Anderson, 2002). "}
