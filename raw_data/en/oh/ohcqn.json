iii Chemical Biological Defense Program Overview Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threats are dynamic and ever -changing. The rapid advancement and global proliferation of chemical and biological (CB) capabilities greatly extends the spectrum of plausible actors, agents, concepts of use, and targets. These advancements enable our nation's state and non -state adversaries to develop unique CBRN threats with t he intent of circumventing our current defenses. To ensure an effective response to these threats, the Department of Defense (DoD) Chemic al and Biological Defense Program (CBDP) continuously and actively develops CBRN defensive capabilities to stay ahead of evolving threats. This 2015 budget request includes $1. 4 billion to provide a framework for the allocation of fiscal resources against valid capability requirements to achieve a strategy -driven balance of risk in accordance with National Defense Strate gies, Department -level objectives, and Service force development priorities. The CBDP published a new strategy in 2012 to address current defense policy set by public law, National strategies, Departmental Directives and Instructions, and senior leadership guidance. This strategy outlined the CBDP vision and mission of a DoD that addresses CBRN threats and minimizes their effects, a nd its mission is to enable the Warfighter to deter, prevent, protect, mitigate, respond, and recover from CBRN threats and effects as part of a layered, integrated defense. To support the vision and mission, the CBDP has four enduring strategic goals tha t define the desired strategic end-states and associated lines of action for the program and its Enterprise Components . These are: 1. Equip the force to successfully conduct military operations to prevent, protect, and respond to CBRN threats and effects. 2. Prevent surprise by anticipating CBRN threats and developing new capabilities for the Warfighter to counter emerging threats. 3. Maintain infrastructure to meet and adapt current and future needs for personnel, equipment, and facilities within funding constrai nts. 4. Lead the Enterprise to integrate and align activities to fulfill the CBDP mission. Throughout 2013 and going forward, the following strategic program objectives guide efforts to accomplish the CBDP Strategic Plan goals: Establish a robust MCM pipeline from requirements definition, through Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, to manufacturing and distribution. This pipeline shall focus on mitigating current CBRN threats using platform technologies capable of expediting responses to validated known and emerging threats. Develop synergistic, technologically advanced environmental surveillance and point -of-need diagnostic capabilities against CBRN threats to enable rapid force pro tection decisions. Volume 4 - iv Provide CBRN defense capabilities to support biosurveillance efforts and enable the Warfighter to achieve information dominance in the CBRN domain. Integrate NTA defense capabilities into future CB defense systems, as appropriate. Develo p and field suitable, effective, and affordable broad -spectrum CB detection capabilities to detect current and emerging CB hazards. Maintain critical capabilities and competencies, aligned with RDA priorities, to rapidly develop, test, and field CBRN defen sive capabilities to the Warfighter. Implement risk -based planning and decision -making processes within the Enterprise. Focused efforts within this budget are captured in a number of emphasis areas that are a collection of mutually -supporting S& T efforts, systems acquisition programs, and T&E capabilities aimed at delivering comprehensive CBR defense capabilities to the warfight er. Emphasis areas are derived from National Strategies, senior leader guidance, and CBDP community priorities. The f our key emphasis areas are: medical countermeasures (MCMs), diagnostics, biosurveillance, and non -traditional agent (NTA) defenses. Medical Countermeasures The National Strategy for Countering Biological Threats emphasized the importance of developing MCM s to reduce impacts of outbreaks of infectious disease whether of natural, accidental, or deliberate origin. Homeland Security Presidential Directi ve (HSPD) -10, \"Biodefense for the 21st Century,\" and HSPD -18, \"MCMs Against Weapons of Mass Destruction,\" d irected U.S. government agencies to \"conduct joint development and procurement of medical countermeasures\" throughout the Interagency and with international p artner nations. MCMs include capabilities to protect the warfighter against CBR threats and mitiga te illness, suffering, and death. MCMs will provide end -to-end countermeasures against emerging infectious diseases, genetically engineered threats, naturally occurring biological phenomena, novel chemical agents, and radiological threats. Program efforts include core medical efforts aimed at developing and delivering pretreatments/prophylaxes and therapeutics to the warfighter. MCMs in development by the CBDP traditionally fall into one of two categories: 1) pretreatments/prophylaxes such as a plague vac cine and post -exposure, pre/post -symptomatic therapeutics such as the Hemorrhagic Fever Virus therapeutic. Diagnostics Diagnostic and analytic -related efforts are a centerpiece of the CBDP's comprehensive capability to counter CBR threats and characterize CBR attacks or events by diagnosing causative agents of disease and providing situational awareness of threat ag ents in the environment. The CBDP has resourced a robust portfolio that includes S&T of CBR diagnostics, systems development and procurem ent Volume 4 - v of point -of-need/point -of-care diagnostic equipment, and continuous assay development and procurement to support fielded a nd developmental diagnostic or analytic platforms . Biosurveillance The CBDP is a key contribut or to the Department's efforts in support of the National Biosurveillance Strategy and it s goal \"to achieve a well-integrated national biosurveillance enterprise that saves lives by providing essential information for better decisionmaking at all levels.\" The CBDP focus and support are aligned with the four enabling capabilities outlined in the National Biosurve illance Strategy. These are; integrate capabilities, build capacity, foster innovation, and strengthen partnerships. Key CBDP efforts include; focusing on the ability to strengthen and integrate capabilities that provide awareness of endemic pathogens in the environment along with warning and characterization of biological attacks or events (analysis and diagnostics) for decision -making; improving the ability to find, track, interdict, and eliminate biological weapons and threats directed against our warf ighters and citizens; and strengthening our ability to conduct forensics and attribution and to prevent re -attack. The CBDP capabilities represent both pre -event (early warning and indications) and post -event (effective consequence management and persisten t surveillance for re -emergence) activities necessary to improve early warning and characterization of man -made (i.e., genetically engineered/synthetic biological agents) and naturally occurring (i.e., emerging infectious diseases and the re -emergence of p athogens from zoonotic reservoirs) disease outbreaks in near real - time. The CBDP is integrating/leveraging various capabilities being developed in other areas across the DoD, Internationally, and w ithin the Interagency in order to provide a n enhanced biosurveillance capability. Non Traditional Agent (NTA) Defense The 2010 QDR directed the DoD to increase resources for R&D of countermeasures and defenses to NTAs in concert with interagen cy partners. DoD efforts supporting NTA defense are a key part of an integrated National effort supporting Research, Development, and Acquisition of defensive capabilities. The CBDP works to: Develop technologies that address existing and emerging NTAs in the near -, mid-, and far -term, including the ability to address multiple capability gaps and provide multi -layered and integrated defenses to NTAs Strengthen and integrate capabilities that provide warning of attack, barrier protection, and both pretreatments/proph ylaxes and post-exposure treatments Field faster, more flexible consequence management capabilities on the battlefield and in the homeland Develop capabilities, policies, and plans that enable us to act swiftly to save lives and restore the effectiveness of contam inated areas. Volume 4 - vi CBDP Support to FY15 Resource Priorities to Counter Biological Threats (Presidential Policy Directive -2) The CBDP program activities directly support the 2015 resource priorities for Countering Biological Threats. The policy priorities spell out three focus areas supported directly or tangentially by the CBDP program: 1) Prevent avoidable epidemics 2) Detect threa ts early and 3) Respond rapidly and effectively. All three priority areas are addressed throughout the CBDP S&T, Advanced Development, an d Procurement efforts. Summary The CBDP continues to effectively meet today's highest priority needs for DoD CBRN defense solutions while shifting to establ ish the agility and flexibility necessary to rapidly adapt to the evolving strategic landscape. This ongoing transformation ensures that currently available technologies are produced, procured, and provided swiftly and that cutting -edge technologies are harnessed to provide improved capabilities in the future. The DoD CBDP continued to enhance CBRN read iness to counter known and emerging threats and collaborated with other Government agencies to foster exchange of knowledge and coordination of CB defense -related activities. This budget request supports the CBDP as a Joint Force enabler fulfilling the ne eds of the Warfighters to ensure that they are trained, equipped, and resourced to complete missions in CBRN environments now and in the future, preserving the security and freedom of our nation.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification Project TM2 provides for applied research for innovative technology approaches to advance medical systems designed to rapidly identify, diagnose, prevent, and treat disease due to exposure to all three of radiological, chemical and biological threat agents. Categories for this project include core science efforts in Medical Chemical, Medical Biological, Diagnostics, and the Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMI). Against radiological threats, this project provides investment for the development of pretreatments (prophylaxis) and post-irradiation therapeutics against radiological/nuclear exposure. Against chemical and biological agents, this project funds applied research for the investigation of new medical countermeasures to include prophylaxes, pretreatments, antidotes, skin decontaminants, and therapeutic drugs against identified and emerging biological and chemical warfare agents. Medical Science and Technology (S&T) efforts in this Budget Activity refine promising medical initiatives identified in Budget Activity 1, resulting in the development of countermeasures to protect against and treat the effects of exposure to chemical and biological (CB) agents. Diagnostic research focuses on providing high quality data closer to the point-of-need comprising devise innovation, panels of biomarkers driven by bioinformatics, and epidemiological modeling tools. The Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMI) was established to coordinate inter-related advanced development and flexible manufacturing capabilities, providing a dedicated, cost-effective, reliable, and sustainable MCM process that meets the Warfighter and national security needs. MCMI efforts within science and technology (S&T) are concentrated in advancing two areas: 1) regulatory science and 2) flexible manufacturing technologies and processes for MCMs. Efforts conducted in these areas are enablers supporting the DoD Medical Countermeasures Advanced Development and Manufacturing (MCM-ADM) capability. In FY13, all Project TB2 research was re-aligned into Project TM2 - Techbase Medical Defense. B.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification Project TT3 validates high-risk/high-payoff technologies, concepts-of-operations, and a new Joint Combat Development concept development and experimentation process that could significantly improve Warfighter capabilities in preparation for transition of mature technologies to advanced development programs requiring chemical and biological (CB) defense technologies. These programs offer an opportunity to identify and efficiently mature emerging technologies including limited objective experiments, laboratory experiments, risk reduction efforts, engineering and integration. These demonstrations and programs seek to demonstrate the potential for enhanced military operational capability and/or cost effectiveness. This project addresses four family of products areas: Biological Resiliency, Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Elimination, Hazard Mitigation and Facilities Protection. Biological resiliency efforts are targeted to reduce biological threats by: (1) improving Department of Defense (DoD) access to the life sciences to combat infectious disease regardless of its cause; (2) establishing and reinforcing DoD concept of operations (CONOPS) against the misuse of the life sciences; and (3) instituting a suite of coordinated DoD and interagency activities that collectively will help influence, identify, inhibit, and/or interdict those who seek to misuse the life sciences. WMD Elimination addresses detection, identification, verification and baseline assessments in support of expeditionary forces deployed in non-permissive environments. Hazard Mitigation addresses Chemical, Biological, and Radiological (CBR) remediation and decontamination processes and demonstrates technologies and methods to restore assets such as mobile equipment, fixed sites, critical infrastructures, personal, and equipment to operational status as a result of having reduced or eliminated CBR contamination. Facilities protection transitions mature technologies to improve individual and critical infrastructure protection capabilities for U.S. and coalition Warfighters. Three demonstrations will be ongoing in FY15: Joint Biological Agent Decontamination System (JBADS) JCTD- Demonstration of operational utility a interior- exterior airframe decontamination capability; Thermal Imaging Dual-Use for Aerosol Monitoring Alarms and Security (TIDAMAS)- Evaluation of a dual capability that can perform chemical standoff detection and ISR; and Joint Concept Development and Experimentation (JCDE)/Rapid Military Utility Assessment Initiative - a partnership with Maneuver Support Center of Excellence (MSCOE) to better ensure S&T solutions address warfighter needs.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification Operational forces have an immediate need to survive, safely operate, and sustain operations in a Chemical and Biological (CB) threat environment across the continuum of global, contingency, special operations/low intensity conflict, counternarcotics, and other high-risk missions. This program element supports the Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) of medical and non-medical CB defensive equipment and materiel. Congress directed centralized management of Department of Defense (DoD) medical and non-medical CB Defense initiatives. DoD missions for civil support operations have recently expanded and have resulted Volume 4 - 63UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603884BP: CHEMICAL/BIOLOGICAL DEFENSE (ACD&P) UNCLASSIFIED Chemical and Biological Defense Program Page 2 of 83 R-1 Line #84Exhibit R-2 , RDT&E Budget Item Justification: PB 2015 Chemical and Biological Defense Program Date: March 2014 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide / BA 4: Advanced Component Development & Prototypes (ACD&P)R-1 Program Element (Number/Name) PE 0603884BP / CHEMICAL/BIOLOGICAL DEFENSE (ACD&P) in providing focus to develop technologies to support CB counterterrorism initiatives. ADC&P is conducted for an array of chemical, biological, and toxin detection and warning systems providing early warning, collector concentrators, generic detection, improved reagents, and decontamination systems using solutions that will remove and/or detoxify contaminated materiel without damaging combat equipment, personnel, or the environment. CB sensors and diagnostics enhance the Departments environmental and medical surveillance efforts by improving the monitoring and surveillance of threats and forces preparing for and engaged in military operations. These efforts are required to enable military commanders and the Military Health System to prevent, treat, and mitigate threats to individual Service Members and military units. Integration of CB sensor and diagnostic data from the programs in this ACD&P will also be usable within the homeland security and Federal public health common operating pictures. The Department of Defense is responsible for research, development, acquisition, and deployment of medical countermeasures to prevent or mitigate the health effects of CB threats to the Armed Forces and directs strategic planning for and oversight of programs to support medical countermeasures development and acquisition for our Armed Forces personnel. The CB medical threat to the Armed Forces, in contrast with public health threats to U.S. citizens, encompasses all potential or continuing enemy actions that can render a Service Member combat ineffective. CB medical threats, because they apply as a whole to military units deployed on a specific mission and/or operations, may result in the unit being unable to complete its mission. CB medical countermeasures developed by DoD, unlike those developed to support U.S. population, must support military commanders practical operational requirements and deployment strategies and must emphasizes prevention of injury and illness and protection of the force. Preventive measures in this ACD&P, such as vaccines against the most likely biological threat agents and traditional / non-traditional chemical agent prophylaxis, conserves fighting strength, decreases the logistics burden by reducing the need for larger deployed hospital footprint and greater demand for tactical and strategic medical evacuation, and satisfies the need for greater flexibility in military planning and operations. When vaccines and other prophylactic medical countermeasures are not available, efforts on this ACD&P support pre-hospitalization treatment, en-route care, hospital care, and long-term clinical outcomes. Specific items in this category include improvements to CB diagnostics and therapeutics to mitigate the consequences of biologic agents and exposure to ionizing radiation due to nuclear or radiological attacks. DoD is the only Federal activity conducting ACD&P on these prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic CB medical countermeasures. The Department of Defense coordinates its efforts with the Departments of Health and Human Services to promote synergy and minimize redundancy. The Department of Defense ensures coordination by participating in the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise interagency strategic planning process (\"One Portfolio\"). The Department of Defense's longstanding experience and success in CB medical countermeasure research, development, acquisition, and deployment not only ensures protection of the Armed Forces, it also accelerates and improves the overall national efforts in CB medical countermeasure research, development, and acquisition because of its unique facilities, testing capabilities, and trained and experienced personnel. ACD&P also supports the development of updated test capabilities to evaluate Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Defense systems. Also included is the Techbase Technology Transition effort which validates high-risk/high-payoff technologies that could significantly improve Warfighter capabilities. The projects in this program element support efforts in the technology development phase of the acquisition strategy and are therefore correctly placed in Budget Activity 4.

Individual efforts are: (1) Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS); (2) Joint Chemical Biological Radiological Agent Water Monitor (JCBRAWM) Increment 2; (3) Joint Standoff Detection System (JSDS); and (4) Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD). The Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS) is the first lightweight, low cost biological surveillance system that will detect, collect, and identify biological warfare agent aerosols. JBTDS will provide warning through the Joint Warning And Reporting Network (JWARN) and archive sample for follow-on analyses. JBTDS will provide near real-time local audio and visual alarm for use by any Military Occupational Specialty (MOS). JBTDS will be man-portable, battery-operable, and easy to employ. JBTDS will be used to provide notification of a biological hazard and enhanced battle space awareness to protect and preserve the force. When networked, JBTDS will augment existing biological detection systems to provide a theater-wide seamless array capable of biological detection, identification and warning. The Joint Chemical Biological Radiological Agent Water Monitor (JCBRAWM) Increment 2 efforts will evaluate existing and emerging technologies to provide improvement to chemical detection in water to meet Tri-Service Drinking Water Standards and to detect emerging threats in water. The Joint Standoff Detection System (JSDS) will provide near real-time detection of chemical and biological attacks/incidents at a standoff distance. The modular system will be tailorable to the Service and can be employed at Aerial Port of Debarkation (APOD)/Sea Port of Debarkation (SPOD), Forward Operating Base (FOB), and on multiple platforms to include: fixed site, aerostat, and ground systems. The system will be networked to allow for cueing of point sensor arrays. Additionally, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) (as demonstrated in the WMD Aerial Collection System (WACS) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD))/Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) platforms could be integrated for sampling and identification. This schedule has been synchronized with the WACS ATD schedule to facilitate data exchange and possible excursions. The Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD) consists of several detection systems. The variants will address sampling of multiple phases of matter; locating liquids and solids on surfaces; and vapor and aerosol monitoring. NGCD will detect and identify non-traditional agents, chemical warfare agents (CWAs), toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) in the air and on surfaces. The NGCD will provide improved CWA/TIC selectivity and sensitivity on multiple platforms as well as multiple environments. These detectors will improve detection, consequence management and reconnaissance, and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) interdiction capabilities. The scope of the project includes detection of agent a few feet away from the detector as well as at the sampling point of the detector.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification This Project supports the development of Contamination Mitigation (ConMit) systems utilizing solutions that will remove and/or detoxify contaminated material without damaging combat equipment, personnel, or the environment. ConMit systems provide a force restoration capability for units that become contaminated. Development efforts will provide systems that reduce operational impact and logistics burden, reduce sustainment costs, increase safety, and minimize environmental effects associated with decontamination and contamination mitigation operations. The programs supported under this Project include (1) Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS), (2) Contamination Indicator Decontamination Assurance System (CIDAS), (3) General Purpose Decontaminant (GPD), (4) Joint Service Equipment Wipe (JSEW), and (5) Joint Biological Aircraft Decontamination (JBAD) System. The DFoS program facilitates the rapid transition of mature Science and Technology (S&T) research efforts to existing Decontamination or ConMit Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) Programs of Record and guides S&T community efforts toward meeting the needs of the Warfighter. Leveraging the outcome of the Materiel Development Decision (MDD) (3QFY11) directed Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), DFoS will develop a Family of Systems (FoS) to provide novel preparatory and responsive contamination mitigation technologies to meet the capability gaps for decontaminating chemical and biological (CB) warfare agents and Non Traditional Agents (NTA) from personnel, equipment, vehicle, ship, and aircraft interiors/exteriors, terrain and fixed facility interiors/exteriors. CIDAS will provide a contamination indicator/decontamination assurance technology; it will consist of an indicator and an applicator, for which there will be three configurations. The indicator will be sprayed on tactical vehicles, shipboard surfaces, crew-served and individual weapons in hostile and non-hostile environments that may have been exposed to traditional and non-traditional chemical contamination. CIDAS is a new capability for the Joint Forces that will reduce logistics burden of decontamination by indicating presence and location of traditional (Nerve and Blister) and non-traditional chemical agents on militarily relevant surfaces pre- and post- decontamination. GPD is a liquid decontaminant that will provide thorough decontamination capabilities for tactical vehicles, shipboard surfaces, crew-served weapons, and individual/ personal weapons in hostile and non-hostile environments that have been exposed to traditional and non-traditional CB contamination. JSEW is a decontamination wipe that will provide immediate/operational decontamination capabilities for sensitive and non-sensitive equipment in hostile and non- hostile environments that have been exposed to traditional (Nerve and Blister) and non-traditional chemical agents/contamination. In addition, the JSEW program is intended to be a replacement for the Individual Equipment Decontamination Kit (M295).

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification This Project provides for Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P). Efforts included in this project are: (1) Joint Effects Model (JEM); (2) the Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN); and (3) Software Support Activity (SSA). JEM and JWARN will utilize the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) Manual prescribed Agile Information Technology Box \"IT Box\" construct for managing requirements for the follow-on increments of capability development. Use of the \"IT Box\" acquisition approach increases flexibility and will expedite fielding of Information System products through a series of Build Decisions (BDs) versus less frequent traditional DoD Milestone B and C decisions. Each program will use an Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document (IS ICD) to describe the required operational capabilities for the development effort. JEM's IS ICD was approved by the Joint Staff J8 Joint Requirements Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense (JRO-CBRND) in September 2013 and JWARN's IS ICD will be reviewed for approval in 2QFY14. After the IS ICD is approved, more detailed requirements will be captured in Requirements Definition Packages (RDP) and will be approved at the Functional Capability Board (FCB) level. In order to support an agile incremental approach, each program will ensure that the \"IT Box\" describes the entire IT program and not just a single increment. The supporting BDs will ensure incorporation of mature technology and development efforts culminating in incremental deliveries of capability to Joint and Service Command and Control (C2) architectures. These limited fielding efforts are based on providing capabilities with the most value to the operators based on Warfighter priorities/needs, maturation of the technology being incorporated and available resources supporting the effort. As software-intensive systems both JEM and JWARN have no separately identifiable unit production components. Both are designated ACAT III programs and unit cost calculations including Program Acquisition Unit Cost/Average Procurement Unit Cost (PAUC/APUC) and Operations and Sustainment (O&S) average annual per unit costs are not applicable. JEM Increment 2, using IT Box Acquisition Strategy, adds capability to JEM Increment 1 including modeling of missile intercepts and improved modeling of hazard events in urban and littoral terrain. It also includes improved architecture called Common CBRN Modeling Interface (CCMI). Together, CCMI and IT Box enable more rapid and less costly integration of Science and Technology updates, aligning with the S&T provider to provide the most current capability to the warfighter. Battlespace commanders and first responders must have a CBRN hazard prediction capability in order to make decisions that will minimize risks of CBRN contamination and enable them to continue mission operations. JEM operates in an integrated fashion with operational and tactical Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems, and in a standalone mode. JEM interfaces and communicates with the other programs such as JWARN, weather systems, intelligence systems, and various databases. Volume 4 - 96UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603884BP: CHEMICAL/BIOLOGICAL DEFENSE (ACD&P) UNCLASSIFIED Chemical and Biological Defense Program Page 35 of 83 R-1 Line #84Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2015 Chemical and Biological Defense Program Date: March 2014 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / SYSTEMS (ACD&P) JWARN Increment 2 will provide an expansion of sensors that will connect to JWARN, increased automation of message handling, improved false alarm filtering, integration of route-planning calculator, and interoperability with additional Command and Control (C2), medical information and evolving Bio-Surveillance systems. JWARN will be located in Command and Control Centers at the appropriate level and will be employed by CBRN defense specialists and other designated personnel to improve the efficiency of limited CBRN personnel assets. This employment will transfer data automatically from existing sensors and to and from the future sensors to provide commanders with the capability to support operational decision making in a CBRN environment. JWARN will integrate existing sensors into a sensor network or host C2 system, but does not provide the sensors that will be employed in the operating environment. JWARN will transition from a Command and Control (C2) platform specific implementation to a Web-based Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) meeting the DoD's evolution to a more comprehensive Common Operating Environment (COE) and will operate as a standalone capability. Activities include: logistical elements, support equipment, manuals and training required to operate and support the system. The Software Support Activity (SSA) is a Chem-Bio Defense user developmental support and service organization to facilitate net-centric interoperability of systems in acquisition for the Warfighter. The SSA provides the CBRN Warfighter with Joint Service solutions for Integrated Architectures, Data Management/Modeling, Information Assurance (IA), Interoperability Certifications, Verification, Validation and Accreditation (VV&A) to support interoperable and integrated net-centric, service-oriented solutions for CBRN systems. The SSA emphasizes development of reference implementations to guide Government and industry system and software developers to ensure that their products meet common interoperability standards. The latest technologies/products include the definition of a Common CBRN Sensor Integration Standard (CCSI) and the CBRN Data Model. These technologies and direct enablers for the development of CBRN integrated sensor networks and the dissemination of CBRN information across all users. The SSA directly supports Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP) initiatives by providing common service oriented architectures and frameworks for the collection and dissemination of Bio-Surveillance and other critical CBRN information.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification This Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) Project supports: The Advanced Development and Manufacturing (ADM) capability provides core and drug development services to include the establishment, commissioning, validation, and attainment of Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP)/Current Good Laboratory Practice (cGLP) for a Medical Countermeasure (MCM) ADM capability for the Department of Defense (DoD). The ADM effort is being executed in two phases. Phase 1 is for the establishment, commissioning, and validation of the ADM capability. This project funds the establishment of a capability to be located in Alachua, Florida. Two ADM cGMP suites, capable of operating at Bio Surety Level (BSL) 3 will be established during the base contract period. There are contract options to incrementally increase capacity, if needed. Upon attainment of cGMP capability Phase 2 begins. During Phase 2, the contractor team will support and maintain the capability in a state of readiness to support MCM development (to include cGMP manufacturing) and assist in training personnel in its use. The second phase includes transition and integration of new technologies to support MCM development activities, from pre-Investigational New Drug Application phase through FDA licensure. Phase 1 and 2 contract was awarded in March 2013 to Nanotherapeutics, Inc., Alachua, FL. The ADM capability sustainment costs during Phase 2 will originate from MCM programs. Biosurveillance (BSV) actively gathers, analyzes, and interprets collected information that includes biosphere data that relate to disease activity and threats to human or animal health in order to achieve early warning of health threats, early detection of health events, and overall situational awareness of disease activity. BSV will align the biosurveillance efforts across DoD and national strategies. BSV will scope and influence BSV capabilities as products to meet Warfighter requirements through innovative management of key BSV initiatives. BSV requirements address medical and physical CBRN mission needs spanned in over 11 requirements documents and through Combatant Commander (COCOM) identified needs. BSV funds will support Joint US Forces Korea (USFK) Portal and Integrated Threat recognition (JUPITR) ATD/BSV ATD which will find, demonstrate, transition, and transfer the best operational concepts and technology solutions in support of a holistic approach to countering biological threats from the laboratory to operational use and theater confirmation of a Biological Event. JUPITR ATD will consist of four legs; Early Warning (EW), Biological Identification Capabilities Sets (BICS), Assessment of Environmental Detectors (AED), and Biosurveillance Portal (BSP). The JUPITR ATD will provide the USFK with a holistic Biosurveillance capability to provide early warning, detection, collection, identification, and theater confirmation of a Biological event. The JUPITR ATD consists of filling capability gaps through information sharing and communication systems and detection/diagnostic systems for the USFK. Outputs will focus on proving component, CONOPS, and subsystem transition into programs of record (PORs) and/or integration into existing PORs. Volume 4 - 109UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603884BP: CHEMICAL/BIOLOGICAL DEFENSE (ACD&P) UNCLASSIFIED Chemical and Biological Defense Program Page 48 of 83 R-1 Line #84Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2015 Chemical and Biological Defense Program Date: March 2014 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / (ACD&P) The Countermeasures for Multi-Drug Resistance-Bacterial (CMDR-B) program develops medical countermeasures (MCMs) for Service members for protection against multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria, including Biological Warfare Agents (BWAs) and organisms that are genetically modified to be MDR. The resulting product(s) will be US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved to prevent or minimize effects of MDR bacterial exposures. Leveraging collaborative Department of Defense (DoD), United States Government, and industry efforts will reduce program risk, lower program cost, and accelerate delivery of therapeutics to the Warfighter. The program will advance MCM candidates against MDR bacterial diseases such as anthrax and plague through the Technology Development phase. The Emerging Infectious Diseases Therapeutics (EID Tx) program is developing and will deliver a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, broad-spectrum medical countermeasure to the Warfighter for protection against naturally occurring or biologically engineered viruses. EID Tx is pursuing influenza indication, EID-Flu MCM, as the first step in the development of a broad spectrum antiviral drug due to a clear and established FDA regulatory approval pathway. The drug in development is highly efficacious against multiple influenza viruses, including the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus, H5N1 avian influenza virus, the most recently identified H7N9 virus from the outbreak in China, and drug resistant strains of influenza viruses. This drug has also demonstrated efficacy against other viruses of concern to the DoD's biodefense program. Ongoing EID Tx drug development will be leveraged to demonstrate additional broad-spectrum MCM's against naturally occurring and/or engineered biowarfare threats. Initial testing to support FY15 down-select for follow-on label extension programs has begun. FDA approval for an influenza treatment is anticipated in FY16 following completion of the SDD phase. The Hemorrhagic Fever Virus (HFV) medical countermeasure acquisition program develops medical countermeasures (MCMs), using high threat, extremely lethal Biological Warfare Agents (BWAs) of the Filoviridae family agents (Ebola and Marburg) as model systems. Medical countermeasures will be advanced through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensure/approval via the FDA 'Animal Rule', which allows for the demonstration of efficacy in relevant animal model(s) when human testing is not ethically feasible. HFV will also conduct animal model development and refinement as needed to support the pivotal animal efficacy testing required under the FDA 'Animal Rule'. Completion of Phase I trials, animal model development, and manufacturing scale up are the focus of the ACD&P phase. FDA approval for HFV therapeutics are expected in FY18 following completion of the SDD phase. The NGDS is an evolutionary acquisition family of systems to provide increments of capability over time across many echelons of the Combat Health Support System. The mission of the NGDS is to provide CBRN threat identification and FDA-cleared diagnostics to inform individual patient treatment and CBRN situational awareness and disease surveillance. NGDS Increment 1 Deployable Component will significantly improve diagnostic capabilities for deployable combat health support units (role 3) while also improving operational suitability and affordability. The term \"Role\" is used to describe the stratification of the four tiers in which medical support is organized, on a progressive basis, to conduct treatment, evacuation, resupply, and functions essential to the maintenance of the health of the force. Role 3 support is normally provided at Division or Service equivalent level and includes specialist laboratory resources. NGDS Increment 2 is intended to provide advanced diagnostics for biological pathogens and toxins, diagnostics for chemical and radiological exposures, and to provide capability to lower echelons of care. The Department of Defense (DoD) funds the technology development phase for vaccines that are directed against validated biological warfare (BW) weapons to include bacteria, viruses, and toxins of biological origin. Effective medical countermeasures to negate the threat of these biological warfare (BW) agents are urgently needed. Vaccines have been identified as the most efficient countermeasure against the validated threat of BW weapons. The Trivalent Filovirus Vaccine (VAC FILO) Program will offer protection against the threat of Ebola and Marburg viruses. The current budget supports development of two prototypes through the Technology Development Phase. The DoD anticipates that the Food Drug Administration (FDA) will approve this vaccine using the 'Animal Rule', which allows for the demonstration of efficacy Volume 4 - 110UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603884BP: CHEMICAL/BIOLOGICAL DEFENSE (ACD&P) UNCLASSIFIED Chemical and Biological Defense Program Page 49 of 83 R-1 Line #84Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2015 Chemical and Biological Defense Program Date: March 2014 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / BIOLOGICAL DEFENSE (ACD&P) on relevant animal model(s). During this phase a scalable manufacturing process is developed. This process will be used to develop current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) lots suitable for a Phase 1 clinical trial. In addition, animal safety and efficacy studies will be conducted to support an Investigational New Drug (IND) submission to the FDA. These efforts will support a Milestone B decision and entry into the Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) phase. The DoD is the Public Health Emergency Countermeasures lead for the advanced development of the Filovirus Vaccine. The Ricin toxin is a validated bioweapon threat due to its availability and efficiency of production. The program supports one DoD vaccine candidate including manufacturing cGMP lots; proof of concept nonclinical efficacy studies and assay development. These efforts also include a Phase 1b clinical trial and regulatory integration. These efforts will support a Milestone B decision and entry into the EMD Phase. The DoD is the Public Health Emergency Countermeasures lead for the advanced development of the Ricin Vaccine. The DoD initiated the Western, Eastern, and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VAC WEVEE) Vaccine program in FY13. To satisfy the competitive prototyping requirement and to reduce program risk, the DoD will develop two prototypes through the Technology Development Phase. The efforts to be conducted during this period include: develop pilot scale manufacturing processes and manufacture of cGMP lots to support nonclinical and clinical studies; develop vaccine formulation that meets the logistical requirements of the DoD; conduct non-clinical GLP safety studies; submit Investigational New Drug (IND) applications; and conduct Phase 1 clinical human safety studies. The DoD anticipates that the FDA will approve these products using the 'Animal Rule', which allows for the demonstration of efficacy in relevant animal model(s). These efforts will support a Milestone B decision and entry into the EMD phase. The DoD is the Public Health Emergency Countermeasures lead for the advanced development of the WEVEE Vaccine. B.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification This Project provides for the development of medical materiel and other medical equipment items necessary for the Technology Development phase of the acquisition life cycle for the advanced development of medical countermeasures (MCMs) for chemical warfare agents including diagnostic equipment, prophylactic, pre-treatment, and therapeutic drugs, and individual/casualty decontamination compounds. A family-of-systems approach for medical defense against chemical warfare agents is required to provide protection, to sustain performance in a chemical environment, and to provide for self-aid/buddy-aid and medical treatment of chemical casualties. Fielding of prophylactic, pre-treatment, and therapeutic drugs and medical devices requires Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. Given the family-of-systems approach for development of chemical MCMs for the treatment of nerve agent intoxication, multiple long-term studies are required to obtain FDA approval to deliver products that effectively integrate with current and projected therapeutic regimens. Efficacy testing of most candidate drugs against chemical warfare agents cannot be conducted in humans; therefore, animal surrogate models must be developed and employed. The program currently funds: Improved Nerve Agent Treatment System (INATS) an enhanced nerve agent treatment regimen consisting of an improved oxime to replace the current fielded oxime 2-pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM), product formulation enhancements to increase survival, and expanded pretreatment indications for the use of pyridostigmine bromide (PB), the active component of Soman Nerve Agent Pyridostigmine (SNAPP).

Acquisition Strategy IMPROVED NERVE AGENT TREATMENT SYSTEM (INATS) Improved Nerve Agent Treatment Systems (INATS) is an enhanced nerve agent treatment regimen designed to replace and provide improved product performance over the Antidote Treatment Nerve Agent Auto-injector (ATNAA). The components of the INATS program include: 1) development of a broad spectrum oxime that is effective against emerging threats to replace the fielded currently fielded oxime 2-pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM); 2) product formulation enhancements to increase survival; and 3) expanded pretreatment indications for pyridostigmine bromide (PB). During the Technology Development Phase, the system integrator will oversee conduct of formulation development efforts, nonclinical toxicology and efficacy studies, Phase 1 human clinical safety studies as well as nonclinical studies to obtain FDA approval for expanding the indications for PB. Following a successful Milestone B and entry in to the Engineering and Manufacturing (EMD) Phase, the system integrator will continue to exercise management oversight with system integration support from a commercial partner or partners to ensure that the development and manufacture of the INATS is in accordance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and guidelines. Prior to FDA licensure, the commercial partner(s) will perform a Phase 2 human clinical safety study, nonclinical toxicology studies and definitive animal efficacy studies. The system integrator will also manufacture an improved oxime formulation and autoinjector delivery system that is stable under operationally relevant temperatures. The system integrator will submit a New Drug Application and seek FDA approval for the INATS product. During the Production and Deployment Phase, the system integrator, in conjunction with a commercial partner, will pursue full rate and stockpile production and will conduct any FDA mandated post-marketing surveillance studies. The system integrator will transfer contracting and logistical responsibilities to the Defense Logistics Agency during the Operations and Support Phase however, as the total life-cycle manager the system integrator will monitor program performance through disposal.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification Operational forces have an immediate need to survive, safely operate, and sustain operations in a radiological/nuclear (R/N) threat environment across a continuum of global, contingency, special operations/low intensity conflict, homeland defense, and other high-risk missions. Exposure to ionizing radiation causes acute radiation syndrome (ARS) which includes damage to blood-forming cells (hematopoietic system), gastrointestinal system, and central nervous system. Treatment of R/N casualties depends on effective use of multiple medical capabilities in an integrated manner. There are currently no FDA-approved prophylactic, therapeutic, or biodosimetry capabilities against ARS. Thus, this program supports the development of medical radiological countermeasures (MRADC) using a family-of-systems approach to provide a full spectrum medical capability including prophylactics, therapeutics, and biodosimetry to protect Warfighters against the radiation threat and to mitigate the medical consequences of exposure to ionizing radiation. MRADC efforts include development of multiple countermeasures to prevent, limit, or reverse the myriad of injuries caused by exposure to radiation resulting in increased survival, decreased incapacity, and sustained operational effectiveness of U.S. Forces. In addition, MRADC will be effective against a broad range of ionizing radiation sources and types and will be useable throughout the full spectrum of healthcare operations. B.

Other Program Funding Summary ($ in Millions) Remarks D. Acquisition Strategy MEDICAL RADIOLOGICAL COUNTERMEASURES (MRADC) The DoD is synchronizing its investments and harmonizing its portfolio with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) which also has a radiation countermeasure program. DoD investments will focus on DoD-unique requirements. In support of the Integrated National Biodefense Portfolio, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was established between HHS and DoD to prevent duplication of efforts and create synergies in the development of MRADC. In support of the MOU, the DoD has entered into Interagency Agreements (IAAs) with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), HHS's advanced developer, to promote the development of MRADC and the Strategic National Medical Radiation Countermeasures Portfolio. Each contract performer whose work is supported through these IAAs will sponsor its drug to the FDA and hold all approvals and or licenses. In accordance with the MRADC revised acquisition strategy, the DoD will harmonize DoD investments with HHS investments. The DoD will invest via IAAs in HHS prototypes focusing on DoD-unique requirements as HHS, in its role as the lead developer for the Technology Development phase in a whole-of-government approach, matures the prototypes to support a DoD down-select at Milestone B.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification This project (TT4) validates high-risk/high-payoff technologies, concepts-of-operations, and reconnaissance and surveillance platforms that could significantly improve Warfighter capabilities in preparation for transition of mature technologies to advanced development programs requiring chemical and biological (CB) defense technologies. These programs offer an opportunity to identify and efficiently mature emerging technologies from laboratory experiments to acquisition programs through risk reduction, engineering and integration. These demonstrations and programs seek to demonstrate the potential for enhanced military operational capability and/or cost effectiveness. Upon conclusion of the technical and operational demonstrations, the user or sponsor provides a determination of the military utility and operational impact of the technology and capability demonstrated. Successfully demonstrated technologies with proven military utility can either be left in place for extended user evaluations, accepted into advanced stages of the formal acquisition process, proceed directly into limited or full-scale production or be returned to the technical base for further development. This project funds three family of products areas (one of which is a new thrust areas to address DoD emphasis on an interagency collaboration for biological detection, surveillance, recovery and resilience and is annotated as such below): Hazard Mitigation, Early Warning, and Biological Resiliency. Hazard Mitigation addresses Chemical, Biological, and Radiological (CBR) remediation and decontamination processes and demonstrates technologies and methods to restore assets such as mobile equipment, fixed sites, critical infrastructures, personal, and equipment to operational status as a result of having reduced or eliminated CBR contamination. The Early Warning family of products achieve enhanced command and control decision making capabilities as a result of a combined and orchestrated family of chemical and biological defense systems deployed on various platforms in remote locations. Biological Resiliency efforts are targeted to reduce biological threats by: (1) improving DoD access to the life sciences to combat infectious disease regardless of its cause; (2) establishing and reinforcing DoD concept of operations (CONOPS) against the misuse of the life sciences; and (3) instituting a suite of coordinated DoD and interagency activities that collectively will help influence, identify, inhibit, and/or interdict those who seek to misuse the life sciences.

Acquisition Strategy TECHBASE TECH TRANSITION (TECHTRAN) The Advanced Technology Demonstrations (ATDs) and Joint Capability Technology Demonstrations (JCTDs) exploit mature and maturing technologies to solve important military problems. ATDs and JCTDs emphasize technology assessment and integration rather than technology development. The goal is to provide a prototype capability to the Warfighter and to support in the evaluation of that capability. The Warfighters evaluate the capabilities in real military exercises and at a scale sufficient to fully assess military utility. When possible, the ATDs will leverage results from existing chemical and biological science and technology (S&T) efforts and prior ATDs. Market research/baselining is performed prior to ATD initiation to determine if a suitable solution exists or whether a solicitation/sole source is required to develop a solution. The ATDs are typically managed by DoD, Federally Funded Research Development Centers (FFRDCs) or University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs). This is done through the Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR) or the Interagency Cost Reimbursable Order (IACRO) in accordance with the Economy Act. In addition, the ATDs utilize the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Broad Area Announcement process to fund promising technologies between Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 4 and TRL 6. The ATD manager, who is typically responsible for total system development, can subcontract industry, academia, or other government agencies to perform individual component development. E.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification Operational forces have an immediate need to survive, safely operate, and sustain operations in a Chemical and Biological (CB) threat environment across the continuum of global, contingency, special operations/low intensity conflict, counternarcotics, and other high-risk missions. Operating forces have a critical need for defense against worldwide proliferation of CB warfare capabilities and for medical treatment of CB casualties. Congress directed centralized management of Department of Defense (DoD) CB Defense initiatives, both medical and non-medical. This program element supports the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) of medical and physical CB defensive equipment and materiel. Projects within BA5 are structured to consolidate Joint and Service-unique tasks within four commodity areas: contamination avoidance, individual and collective force protection, decontamination, and medical countermeasures. This consolidation provides for development and operational testing of equipment for Joint Service use and for Service-unique requirements. Volume 4 - 146UNCLASSIFIED PE 0604384BP: CHEMICAL/BIOLOGICAL DEFENSE (EMD) UNCLASSIFIED Chemical and Biological Defense Program Page 2 of 91 R-1 Line #118Exhibit R-2 , RDT&E Budget Item Justification: PB 2015 Chemical and Biological Defense Program Date: March 2014 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide / BA 5: System Development & Demonstration (SDD)R-1 Program Element (Number/Name) PE 0604384BP / CHEMICAL/BIOLOGICAL DEFENSE (EMD) Contamination avoidance efforts under this system development program will provide U.S. forces with real-time hazard assessment capabilities. They include multi- agent point and remote chemical detection for ground, aircraft, and shipboard applications; automated warning and reporting systems; integrated radiation detection and monitoring equipment; and enhanced battlefield reconnaissance capabilities. Force protection efforts will increase protection levels while decreasing physical and psychological burdens imposed by protective equipment. The Secretary of Defense is responsible for research, development, acquisition, and deployment of medical countermeasure equipment and materiel to prevent or mitigate the health effects of CB threats to the Armed Forces and directs strategic planning for and oversight of programs to support medical countermeasures development and acquisition for our Armed Forces personnel. The CB medical threat to the Armed Forces, in contrast with public health threats to U.S. citizens, encompasses all potential or continuing enemy actions that can render a Service Member combat ineffective. CB medical threats, because they apply as a whole to military units deployed on a specific mission and/or operations, may result in the unit being unable to complete its mission. CB medical countermeasures developed by DoD, unlike those developed to support the U.S. population, must support military commanders practical operational requirements and deployment strategies and must emphasize prevention of injury and illness and protection of the force. Preventive measures in this SDD, such as vaccines and chemical prophylaxis, conserves fighting strength, decreases the logistics burden by reducing the need for larger deployed hospital footprint and greater demand for tactical and strategic medical evacuation, and satisfy the need for greater flexibility in military planning and operations. When vaccines and other prophylactic medical countermeasures are not available, efforts on this SDD support pre-hospitalization treatment, en-route care, hospital care, and long-term clinical outcomes. Specific items in this category include CB diagnostics, and therapeutics to mitigate the consequences of biologic threats and exposure to ionizing radiation due to nuclear or radiological attacks. The Department of Defense coordinates its efforts with the Departments of Health and Human Services to promote synergy and minimize redundancy. The Department of Defense ensures coordination by participating in the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise interagency strategic planning process (\"One Portfolio\"). The Department of Defense's longstanding experience and success in CB medical countermeasure research, development, acquisition, and deployment not only ensures protection of the Armed Forces, it also accelerates and improves the overall national efforts in CB medical countermeasure research, development, and acquisition because of its unique facilities, testing capabilities, and trained and experienced personnel. The projects in this program element support efforts in the engineering and manufacturing phase of the acquisition strategy and are therefore correctly placed in Budget Activity 5.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification This project supports System Development and Demonstration and Low Rate Initial Production (SDD/LRIP) of an array of reconnaissance, detection and identification equipment, and warning systems. Efforts included in this project are: (1) Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Dismounted Reconnaissance Systems (CBRN DRS); (2) Joint Biological Point Detection System (JBPDS); (3) Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS); (4) Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Defense Support; (5) Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Detection Support; and (6) Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD). The CBRN Dismounted Reconnaissance Systems (CBRN DRS) consists of portable, commercial and government off-the-shelf equipment which provides personnel protection from current and emerging CBRN hazards through detection, identification, sample collection, decontamination, marking, and hazard reporting for CBRN threats. The system supports Dismounted Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and CBRN Site Assessment missions which enable more detailed and near real-time CBRN information flow for the Warfighter. The program will address emerging CBRN threat requirements in order to provide an enhanced capability for the future. The Joint Biological Point Detection System (JBPDS) is a fully automated system that detects, warns, and provides presumptive identification and samples for follow-on confirmatory analysis. It is an ACAT II program in Full Rate Production (FRP). The Army platforms include the JBPDS on the Biological Integrated Detection System (BIDS) and the Stryker Nuclear Biological Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle (NBCRV). The Navy installs the JBPDS on several classes of ships such as Cruisers and Amphibious Transports. Engineering Changes to refresh the technology of the JBPDS consists of two separate efforts (one funded by procurement and one RDT&E funded) that, when combined, will reduce lifecycle costs and address obsolescence concerns. The existing computer hardware and operating system in the JBPDS will not meet Information Assurance standards due to obsolescence. Under the existing production contract, an engineering effort is underway to address the computer and operating system obsolescence concerns. The element being developed under RDT&E funding is a new detector technology that will significantly reduce false positives resulting in improved reliability, reduced consumable use, and reduction in operational and sustainment costs. The Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS) will integrate, test and produce the first lightweight (less than 37 lbs), low cost biological surveillance system that will detect, collect and identify biological warfare agent aerosols. JBTDS will provide warning through the Joint Warning And Reporting Network (JWARN) and archive samples for follow-on analyses. JBTDS will provide near real-time local audio and visual alarm for use by any Military Occupational Specialty (MOS). JBTDS components will be man-portable, battery-operable and easy to employ. JBTDS will be used organically at battalion level and below and provide notification of a hazard and enhanced battle space awareness to protect and preserve the force. When networked, JBTDS will augment existing biological detection systems to provide Volume 4 - 149UNCLASSIFIED PE 0604384BP: CHEMICAL/BIOLOGICAL DEFENSE (EMD) UNCLASSIFIED Chemical and Biological Defense Program Page 5 of 91 R-1 Line #118Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2015 Chemical and Biological Defense Program Date: March 2014 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / CA5 / CONTAMINATION AVOIDANCE (EMD) a theater-wide seamless array capable of biological detection, identification and warning. Units equipped with JBTDS will conduct biological surveillance missions to detect BWA aerosol clouds, collect a sample, and identify the agent to support time sensitive force protection decisions. JBTDS will leverage potential common identification technology solutions to additional programs and will address modernization of NBCRV and other platforms. The Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Defense program supports the on-going chemical and biological (CB) defense efforts as acquisition programs address emerging threat requirements across the full spectrum of conflict. Dedicated initiatives and projects will transition information, technologies, and capability into acquisition strategies that account for the breadth and depth of emerging threats which span the full range of military missions. By leveraging previous work done on NTAs (NTA DETECT) within the DoD, interagency cooperation, and international partnerships, the NTA Defense program will provide essential enablers such as threat understanding; operational impacts of performance trades; and comprehensive, integrated, and layered defense concepts against current CB threats. The program will develop a balanced portfolio which will target capabilities to reduce risk from technology gaps inherent from emerging threats. Additional efforts in conducting systems engineering analysis will occur in order to identify and consolidate capability knowledge gaps and prioritize required investments. The Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Detect project will identify, evaluate and continue to transition advanced detection and identification system(s) through follow-on technology insertion efforts which enhance the Domestic Response Capability (DRC), Advanced Threat (AT) Box, CBRN DRS (Dismounted Reconnaissance Sets, Kits, and Outfits), and Next Generation Chemical Detector programs. These efforts will ensure that specialized units will maintain situational awareness and have the ability to respond to emerging and escalating threats. The systems provide a mid-term capability to detect emerging threat materials and afford the Warfighter the ability to support domestic response and force protection missions. These systems will leverage common core technologies to detect and identify threats that can be exploited for lab deployable, fixed site and handheld applications. The Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD) is several detection system variants for multi phase of matter sampling, location of liquid solids on surfaces, and vapor and aerosol monitoring. NGCD will detect and identify non-traditional agents, chemical warfare agents (CWAs), toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) in the air and on surfaces. The NGCD will provide improved CWA/TIC selectivity and sensitivity on multiple platforms as well as multiple environments. This sensor will improve detection, consequence management and reconnaissance, and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) interdiction capabilities. The scope of the project includes detection of agent a few feet away from the detector as well as the sampling point of the detector. B.

Acquisition Strategy CBRN DISMOUNTED RECONNAISSANCE SYSTEMS The Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear Dismounted Reconnaissance Systems (CBRN DRS) program uses a government-off-the-shelf (GOTS)/commercial-off- the-shelf (COTS) non-developmental item (NDI) single step to full capability acquisition approach. This strategy employs an NDI acquisition concept to establish a simplified management framework to translate mission needs and emerging technology capabilities into a stable, affordable, and well-managed acquisition program. JOINT BIO POINT DETECTION SYSTEM (JBPDS) The technology update for the detector focuses on the Rapid Agent Aerosol Detector (RAAD); being developed by MIT-LL with producibility and logistics support from Kansas City Plant (KCP). This technology update will be used to support the Joint US Forces Korea Portal and Integrated Threat Reduction (JUPITR) advanced technology demonstration (ATD). JOINT BIO TACTICAL DETECTION SYSTEM (JBTDS) The JBTDS is being developed using an evolutionary acquisition strategy. JBTDS will maximize the use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and Government off- the-shelf (GOTS) technology. The awards for the Technology Development (TD) phase utilized a best value approach via the competitive CBRNE mission support contract to three contractor teams. Full and open competition will be utilized for the EMD contract with options for Low Rate Initial Production and Full Rate Production. Coordination with other programs (Common Analytical Laboratory System and Next Generation Diagnostic System) is occurring to share information and leverage potential common identification technology solutions to the three programs.

The request for proposal was released July 2013. The goal for the initial stage of development will be to award multiple contracts for each variant of the NGCD. Full and open competition will be used to award one contract per variant at Milestone B. Mature technology will be accelerated as appropriate. NON TRADITIONAL AGENT DEFENSE (NTA DEFENSE) The Non-Traditional Agent Defense technology assessments, performance tradeoff analysis, and mission decomposition will provide acquisition information, technology, and evaluation testbeds to afford acquisition programs the ability to, more rapidly with less risk, develop capabilities for the Warfighter. The ability to attain situational awareness and respond to any unknown and emerging threat hazard will be attained through these incremental transitions to acquisition programs. By leveraging previous work done on NTAs within the DoD, the interagency, and internationally, the NTA Defense will provide essential enablers of a comprehensive, integrated, and layered defense against current CB threats and develop a balanced portfolio targeted at capabilities that preclude technological surprise from emerging threats. NON TRADITIONAL AGENT DETECTION (NTA DETECT) The Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Detection technology assessments, performance tradeoff analyses, and mission decomposition transitioned a detection capability through incremental acquisition that afforded the Warfighter ability to attain situational awareness and respond to unknown and emerging hazards. COTS/GOTS assessments were used in order to lower program risks, reduce costs, and ensure a higher confidence in selected technologies. The project will address next priority mission areas and threats underneath the NTA Defense profile. E.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification This project supports System Development and Demonstration and Low Rate Initial Production (SDD/LRIP) for programs that provide a comprehensive, integrated and layered Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear (CBRN) protection and response capability for military installations and specialized military consequence management units both at home and abroad. Particular emphasis is placed on improving military-civilian interoperability in CBRN detection and response capabilities; providing tiered levels of CBRN protection and response capabilities to military installations; and tailored modular and integrated COTS solutions to consequence management units. Included in this project are the following developmental efforts: The Common Analytical Laboratory System capability (CALS) will be modular, scalable and adaptable to a variety of concept of operations (CONOPS) and environmental conditions. Currently, fielded systems have been designed independently by various agencies with the intent of meeting a specific units requirements. As a result, multiple mobile lab configurations exist with differing sustainment tails and lacking in commonality. The analytical detection package fielded will be fitted to the specific mission and CONOPS of the gaining unit and be able to detect and identify Chemical Warfare Agents (CWAs), Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs), Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs) and Biological Warfare Agents (BWAs). Users of the system will include the National Guard Bureau Civil Support Teams, the Army 20th Support Command, the Army Medical Laboratory, the Air Force, and the Navy. The Special Purpose Units Chemical Biological Equipment program provides for the acquisition and ongoing assessment of Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) detection, protection and decontamination equipment for these units. The Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Team Program supports the ongoing assessment and acquisition of COTS and GOTS hand held analytical detection, protection, decontamination and sampling equipment for survey in order to expand/enhance the operational capabilities of the (57) WMD CST Teams. This includes modernization of detection capabilities inside the Analytical Laboratory System to maintain system viability until the CALS is fielded. B.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification Funding supports System Development and Demonstration and Low Rate Initial Production (SDD/LRIP) of Joint Service Chemical, Biological, and Radiological (CBR) Collective Protection (CP) systems that are smaller, lighter, less costly to produce and maintain, and more logistically supportable enabling mission accomplishment in CBR environments. CP systems can be installed on any type of platform, such as, hard and soft shelters, vehicles, ships, aircraft, and buildings. CP systems provide spaces safe from the effects of CBR contamination. The system included in this project is the Joint Expeditionary Collective Protection (JECP). JECP provides the Joint Expeditionary Forces a CP capability which is lightweight, compact, modular, and affordable. A family of systems is planned that will allow the application of CP to transportable soft-side shelters, enclosed spaces of opportunity, and in remote austere locations as a standalone resource. JECP will be capable of protecting personnel groups of varying size, unencumbered by Individual Protective Equipment (IPE), from the effects of CB agents, Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs), radiological particles, heat, dust, and sand. The employment of JECP is a strategic deterrence against enemy use of CBR agents or TIMs, and will reduce the need for personnel and equipment decontamination. B.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification This project provides System Development and Demonstration (SDD) for: (1) the Contaminated Human Remains Pouch (CHRP); (2) the Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS); (3) Contamination Indicator Decontamination Assurance System (CIDAS); (4) General Purpose Decontaminant (GPD); (5) Joint Service Equipment Wipe (JSEW); and (6) Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP). The Contaminated Human Remains Pouch (CHRP) program will provide the capability to protect personnel handling and processing human remains contaminated with Chemical, Biological, Radiological, or Nuclear (CBRN) contamination. The CHRP is a body bag designed to contain chemical, biological, or radiological contaminated fluids and gasses from contaminated remains. The CHRP will fulfill gaps as described in the Mortuary Affairs (MA) Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) for safe intra- theater handling and transport of contaminated human remains (CHR). The CHRP will provide protection by containing CHR during recovery and transport from the point of fatality to the MA Activity. The CHRP will contain fluid and vapor CBRN hazards associated with the CHR to reduce the spread of contamination and reduce the hazard to personnel handling the CHR and the environment. Successful development and procurement of the CHRP will provide Warfighters with the capability to safely handle, transport, and temporarily store or inter CHR in a theater of operations. The Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS) program facilitates the rapid transition of mature Science and Technology (S&T) research developments to existing Decontamination or Contamination Mitigation ICD Programs of Record and guides S&T community efforts toward meeting the needs of the Warfighter. DFoS will develop a Family of Systems (FoS), to include equipment, to improve decontamination processes, and decontaminant solutions to meet the capability gaps for decontaminating Non-Traditional Agents (NTA) and chemical and biological (CB) warfare agents from personnel, equipment, vehicle interiors/exteriors, terrain, and fixed facilities. CIDAS will provide a contamination indicator/decontamination assurance technology; it will consist of an indicator and an applicator, for which there will be three configurations. The indicator will be sprayed on tactical vehicles, shipboard surfaces, crew-served and individual weapons in hostile and non-hostile environments that may have been exposed to traditional and non-traditional chemical contamination. CIDAS is a new capability for the Joint Forces that will reduce logistics burden of decontamination by indicating presence and location of traditional (Nerve and Blister) and non-traditional chemical agents on militarily relevant surfaces pre- and post- decontamination. GPD is a liquid decontaminant that will provide thorough decontamination capabilities for tactical vehicles, shipboard surfaces, crew-served weapons, and individual/ personal weapons in hostile and non-hostile environments that have been exposed to traditional and non-traditional CB contamination.

In addition, the JSEW is intended to be a replacement for the Individual Equipment Decontamination Kit (M295). The Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) Trail Boss provides a single access point to the full spectrum of CBRN expertise and support weapon system programs integration of CBRN Survivability into Department of Defense (DOD) programs designated as CBRN Mission Critical and those requiring CBRN capabilities. MDAP projects across the FYDP promote consistency of CBRN defense capabilities and systems' architectures across Services. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Decontamination System MDAP project will develop an integrated decontamination containment system and decontaminant delivery system to support the JSF Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&E) to satisfy specific F-35 decontamination requirements through aircraft-unique interfaces and demonstrate the aircraft's ability to meet CB decontamination and survivability requirements.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification This project provides Engineering & Manufacturing Development Phase and Low Rate Initial Production (EMD/LRIP) for individual protection equipment, with the goal of providing equipment that allows the individual soldier, sailor, airman, or Marine to operate in a contaminated Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) environment with little or no degradation of his/her performance. Included in this program are: (1) The Joint Service Aircrew Mask (JSAM) for Tactical (TA), Strategic (SA), and Rotary Wing (RW) aircraft are Acquisition Category (ACAT) III programs, incrementally developed with multiple variants for respiratory protection. The JSAM will be a lightweight chemical and biological (CB) protective mask that will be worn as CB protection for most Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine fixed wing (FW) and RW aircrew members. All JSAM variants will be compatible with most below-the-neck (BTN) CB protection ensembles and existing aircrew life support equipment (ALSE). They will include a protective hood assembly, CB filter, blower assembly, and an intercom for ground communication. They will also provide flame and thermal protection, demist/emergency demist, and anti-drowning features. The goal of the JSAM programs is to develop, manufacture, field, and sustain an aircrew respirator systems that, in conjunction with BTN clothing ensembles, will provide the capability for all aircrew to fly throughout their full operating envelope in an actual or perceived CB warfare environment. The JSAM TA and SA respirators are being developed for use in the majority of Department of Defense (DoD) FW aircraft except for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF). The JSAM TA will provide CB and anti-G protection up to nine times the vertical force (Gz), for aircrew in high-performance aircraft. The JSAM SA will be used in aircrew positions that do not require anti-G protection and provide CB protection for positions that only need pressure breathing for altitude. The JSAM-JSF is a CB respirator being specifically designed to support the F-35. It is designed to ensure that system integration and qualification of CB protection and survivability requirements are achieved as derived from the JSF operational requirements document. Prior to FY15, this project was funded under the JSAM funding line. When integrated with aircraft and pilot mounted equipment, the JSAM-JSF will provide combined CB, hypoxia and anti-G protection to all F-35 users, including the United States Air Force (USAF), Navy (USN), Marine Corps (USMC), and International Partners. The JSAM MPU-5 RW mask is being developed for use by pilots and aircrew in the majority of DoD RW aircraft in the United States Army (USA) except AH-64 users, USAF, USN, USMC, and United States Coast Guard (USCG). The JSAM RW will integrate with most BTN CB ensembles, normal aircrew flight equipment, and rotary wing flight helmets. The system contains a removable face plate, allowing the user to fly \"face free\" in MOPP 2.5 when the threat level dictates, thereby reducing physiological burden and improving field of view. If threat level warrants, the user can install their face plate into an already donned hood and enter MOPP 4 without removing their flight helmet.

The effort is supported by the Capabilities Production Document for the JSGPM, which outlines the need for a robust TIC/Toxic Industrial Material (TIM) protection capability. It is expected that new capabilities demonstrated through the activities in this project will be leveraged and integrated into future increments of UIPE. (3) The Uniform Integrated Protection Ensemble (UIPE). The objective of UIPE is to fully integrate chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear (CBRN) and toxic industrial material (TIM) protection into an ensemble, identical in fit and form to the combat uniform (including mask-helmet integration and protective boots and gloves), thus negating the need for separate protective ensemble components. This integrated protection approach will result in increased Warfighter operational performance in a CBRN environment. The UIPE program will develop, integrate, test, procure and field incremental capability solutions that are modular in function and offer improvements in form and fit over current systems; the program will explore trade-space in areas such as protection level, heat stress, durability, antimicrobial properties, flame resistance, launderability, self-detoxification, and protection time in order to provide capabilities that afford maximum utility to the Warfighter. Where appropriate modeling and simulation tools will be used to lower UIPE program risks, reduce costs, and ensure a high confidence in selected technologies. UIPE Increment 1 is aimed specifically at providing enhanced individual protection capabilities to the Warfighter through reduction of physiological and psychological effects associated with CBRN protective garment thermal burden, weight, and bulk. UIPE Increment 1 achieved MS C approval in June 2013 and is now in the Production and Deployment (P&D) phase.

Other Program Funding Summary ($ in Millions) Line Item FY 2013 FY 2014FY 2015 Acquisition Strategy JS AIRCREW MASK FIXED WING (JSAM FW) The overall JSAM acquisition approach is phased due to the complexity of interfacing with almost 200 aircraft types and models with different mission sets, Aviation Life Support Equipment (ALSE), cockpit layouts, priorities, etc. JSAM will pursue two materiel solutions for fixed wing aircraft; the JSAM Tactical (TA) and JSAM Strategic (SA) programs. JSAM TA and SA must be compatible with current CB ensembles and provide flame protection and will replace all existing Pressure Breathing for Gravity (PBG) and non-PBG CB aircrew respirators. Both solutions are being pursued via Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) and integration efforts applied to already fielded items. The JSAM TA (A/P22P-14A) utilizes a phased acquisition strategy to provide aircrew of all Services with individual head-eye-respiratory protection against Chemical-Biological (CB) warfare agents. The JSAM TA effort will test the Pressure Breathing for Gravity (PBG) Mask to aircraft platforms. The ECP will be accomplished through leveraging a Sole Source (SS)/Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract and fielded via Competitive/FFP contract. The JSAM SA (Modified M53 (MM53)) effort will test and field a mask for aircrew positions not requiring PBG capabilities. This contract was awarded via sole source to Avon Protection Systems, Cadillac, Michigan to modify and field a commercially available mask (M53).

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification This project supports System Development and Demonstration and Low Rate Initial Production (SDD/LRIP). Efforts included in this project are: (1) Joint Effects Model (JEM); (2) the Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN); and (3) Software Support Activity (SSA). JEM and JWARN will utilize the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) Manual prescribed Agile Information Technology Box \"IT Box\" construct for managing requirements for the follow-on increments of capability development. Use of the \"IT Box\" acquisition approach increases flexibility and will expedite fielding of Information System products through a series of Build Decisions (BDs) versus less frequent traditional DoD Milestone B and C decisions. Each program will use an Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document (IS ICD) to describe the required operational capabilities for the development effort. JEM's IS ICD was approved by the Joint Staff J8 Joint Requirements Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense (JRO-CBRND) in September 2013 and JWARN's IS ICD will be reviewed for approval in 2QFY14. After the IS ICD is approved, more detailed requirements will be captured in Requirements Definition Packages (RDP) and will be approved at the Functional Capability Board (FCB) level. In order to support an agile incremental approach, each program will ensure that the \"IT Box\" describes the entire IT program and not just a single increment. The supporting BDs will ensure incorporation of mature technology and development efforts culminating in incremental deliveries of capability to Joint and Service Command and Control (C2) architectures. These limited fielding efforts are based on providing capabilities with the most value to the operators based on Warfighter priorities/needs, maturation of the technology being incorporated and available resources supporting the effort. As software-intensive systems both JEM and JWARN have no separately identifiable unit production components. Both are designated ACAT III programs and unit cost calculations including Program Acquisition Unit Cost/Average Procurement Unit Cost (PAUC/APUC) and Operations and Sustainment (O&S) average annual per unit costs are not applicable. JEM Increment 2, using IT Box Acquisition Strategy, adds capability to JEM Increment 1 including modeling of missile intercepts and improved modeling of hazard events in urban and littoral terrain. It also includes improved architecture called Common CBRN Modeling Interface (CCMI). Together, CCMI and IT Box enable more rapid and less costly integration of Science and Technology updates, aligning with the S&T provider to provide the most current capability to the warfighter. Battlespace commanders and first responders must have a CBRN hazard prediction capability in order to make decisions that will minimize risks of CBRN contamination and enable them to continue mission operations. JEM operates in an integrated fashion with operational and tactical Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems, and in a standalone mode. JEM interfaces and communicates with the other programs such as JWARN, weather systems, intelligence systems, and various databases.

JWARN will be located in Command and Control Centers at the appropriate level and will be employed by CBRN defense specialists and other designated personnel to improve the efficiency of limited CBRN personnel assets. This employment will transfer data automatically from existing sensors and to and from the future sensors to provide commanders with the capability to support operational decision making in a CBRN environment. JWARN will integrate existing sensors into a sensor network or host C2 system, but does not provide the sensors that will be employed in the operating environment. JWARN will transition from a Command and Control (C2) platform specific implementation to a Web-based Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) meeting the DoD's evolution to a more comprehensive Common Operating Environment (COE) and will operate as a standalone capability. Activities include: logistical elements, support equipment, manuals and training required to operate and support the system. The Software Support Activity (SSA) is a Chem-Bio Defense user developmental support and service organization to facilitate net-centric interoperability of systems in acquisition for the Warfighter. The SSA provides the CBRN Warfighter with Joint Service solutions for Integrated Architectures, Data Management/Modeling, Information Assurance (IA), Interoperability Certifications, Verification, Validation and Accreditation (VV&A) to support interoperable and integrated net-centric, service-oriented solutions for CBRN systems. The SSA emphasizes development of reference implementations to guide Government and industry system and software developers to ensure that their products meet common interoperability standards. The latest technologies/products include the definition of a Common CBRN Sensor Integration Standard (CCSI) and the CBRN Data Model. These technologies and direct enablers for the development of CBRN integrated sensor networks and the dissemination of CBRN information across all users. The SSA directly supports Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP) initiatives by providing common service oriented architectures and frameworks for the collection and dissemination of Bio-Surveillance and other critical CBRN information.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification This project funds medical countermeasures, development of reagents, assays, diagnostic equipment, biosurveillance and supporting efforts. The Advanced Development and Manufacturing (ADM) capability (formerly the Medical Countermeasures Advanced Development and Manufacturing (MCMI) program) provides core and drug development services to include the establishment, commissioning, validation, and attainment of Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP)/ Current Good Laboratory Practice (cGLP) for a MCM ADM capability for the Department of Defense (DoD). The ADM effort is being executed in two phases. Phase 1 is for the establishment, commissioning, and validation of the ADM capability. This project funds the establishment of a capability to be located in Alachua, Florida. Two ADM cGMP suites, capable of operating at Bio Surety Level (BSL) 3 will be established during the base contract period. There are contract options to incrementally increase capacity. Upon attainment of cGMP capability Phase 2 begins. During Phase 2, the contractor team will support and maintain the capability in a state of readiness to support MCM development (to include cGMP manufacturing) and assist in training personnel in its use. The second phase includes transition and integration of new technologies to support MCM FDA required development activities. Phase 1 and 2 contract was awarded in March 2013 to Nanotherapeutics, Inc., Alachua, FL. The ADM capability sustainment costs during Phase 2 will originate from Government MCM programs using this capability. The Critical Reagents Program's (CRP) strategy establishes a core research and development capability by developing biological threat agent reference materials (strains, antigens, antibodies and nucleic acids) and detection/diagnostic assays for biothreat agent detection. These reagents/assays are leveraged across multiple programs to meet the requirements of the Warfighter and Joint biological defense systems and support the biological defense community. Through the Targeted Acquisition of Reference Materials Augmenting Capabilities (TARMAC) initiative, the CRP will use a systematic approach to the introduction of materials and information into MCM development. BSV programs align the Biosurveillance efforts across the DoD and national strategies. The BSV program will scope and influence BSV capabilities as products to meet Warfighter requirements through innovative management of key BSV initiative. BSV will also support the Joint US Forces Korea (USFK) Portal and Integrated Threat Recognition (JUPITR) ATD which will find, demonstrate, transition, and transfer the best operational concepts and technology solutions in support of a holistic approach to countering biological threats from laboratory to operational use. Depending on the maturity, outputs will focus on providing component, CONOPS, and subsystem transition into programs of record (PORs) and/or integration into existing PORs. Technologies identified from the JUPITR ATD will be fielded in FY16 to Pacific Command (PACOM). Future ATD developments will continue to bridge communication gaps between US Forces across other Combatant Command (COCOMs).

EID Tx is pursuing influenza indication, EID-Flu MCM, as the first step in the development of a broad spectrum antiviral drug due to a clear and established FDA regulatory approval pathway. The drug in development is highly efficacious against multiple influenza viruses, including the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus, H5N1 avian influenza virus, the most recently identified H7N9 influenza virus from the outbreak in China, and drug resistant strains of influenza viruses. This drug has also demonstrated efficacy against other viruses of concern to the DoD's biodefense program. Ongoing EID Tx drug development will be leveraged to demonstrate additional broad-spectrum MCM's against naturally occurring and/or engineered biowarfare threats. Initial testing to support FY15 down-select for follow-on label extension programs has begun. FDA approval for an influenza treatment is anticipated in FY16 following completion of the SDD phase. The Hemorrhagic Fever Virus (HFV) Medical Countermeasure Acquisition Program develops medical countermeasures (MCMs), using high threat, extremely lethal Biological Warfare Agents (BWAs) of the Filoviridae family agents (Ebola and Marburg) as model systems. Medical countermeasures will be advanced through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensure/approval via the FDA 'Animal Rule', which allows for the demonstration of efficacy in relevant animal model(s) when human testing is not ethically feasible. HFV will also conduct animal model development and refinement as needed to support the pivotal animal efficacy testing required under the FDA 'Animal Rule'. Completion of Phase I trials, animal model development, and manufacturing scale up are the focus of the ACD&P phase. FDA approval for Filovirus therapeutics are expected in FY18 following completion of the SDD phase. The DoD funds the development of vaccines that are directed against validated biological warfare (BW) weapons to include bacteria, viruses, and toxins of biological origin. Effective medical countermeasures to negate the threat of these BW agents are urgently needed. Vaccines have been identified as the most efficient countermeasure against the validated threat of BW weapons. Products under development in this budget item include Recombinant Botulinum A/B and Plague vaccines. Efforts to be conducted during the Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase include the development of large scale manufacturing process and validation of that process, nonclinical studies, demonstration of manufacturing consistency, and expanded clinical human safety studies. The results of these efforts, and those conducted during the EMD phase, will be used to submit a Biologic License Application (BLA) to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for product licensure. To evaluate vaccine effectiveness, pivotal animal studies will be conducted concurrently with the Phase 3 clinical trial to satisfy the requirements of the FDA's \"Animal Rule\". The DoD anticipates that the FDA will approve these products using the Animal Rule, which allows for the demonstration of efficacy in relevant animal model(s). Upon FDA licensure, the product will transition to full-scale licensed production. The DoD also has the mission to maintain Investigational New Drug (IND) vaccines in Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) storage and to conduct the periodic potency and sterility testing of these materials to support submissions to the FDA. These IND vaccines will be used to provide additional levels of protection to laboratory workers in the Special Immunizations Program (SIP) conducting research on these diseases. B.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The SBIR Program is a Congressionally mandated program established to increase the participation of small business in federal research and development (R&D). Currently, each participating government agency must reserve 2.5% of its extramural R&D for SBIR awards to competing small businesses. The goal of the SBIR Program is to invest in the innovative capabilities of the small business community to help meet government R&D objectives while allowing small companies to develop technologies and products which they can then commercialize through sales back to the government or in the private sector. The Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Program like SBIR, is a Government-wide program, mandated by the Small Business Research and Development Enhancement Act of 1992, PL 102-564. STTR was established in FY94 as a three-year pilot program. In early 1996, the General Accounting Office (GAO) conducted a comprehensive review of the Government-wide STTR Program to determine the effectiveness of the pilot program. Upon review of the GAO report, Congress voted to reauthorize the STTR Program to the year 2000, consistent with the authorization period for the SBIR Program. STTR was established as a companion program to the SBIR Program and is executed in essentially the same manner; however, there are several distinct differences. The STTR Program provides a mechanism for participation by university, Federally-Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), and other non-profit research institutions. Specifically, the STTR Program is designed to provide an incentive for small companies and research at academic institutions and non- profit research and development institutions to work together to move emerging technical ideas from the laboratory to the marketplace to foster high-tech economic development and to advance U.S. economic competitiveness. Each STTR proposal must be submitted by a team which includes a small business (as the prime contractor for contracting purposes) and at least one research institution, which have entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement for the purposes of the STTR effort. Furthermore, the project must be divided up such that the small business performs at least 40% of the work and the research institution(s) performs at least 30% of the work. The remainder of the work may be performed by either party or a third party. The budget is separate from the SBIR budget and is significantly smaller (0.15% of the extramural R&D budget vs. 2.5% for the SBIR Program). The DoD has consolidated management and oversight of the CBDP into a single office within the OSD. The Army was designated as the Executive Agent for coordination and integration of the Chemical and Biological Defense (CBD) program. The executive agent for the SBIR/STTR portion of the program is the Army Research Office-Washington.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification This Project provides for the upgrade and modernization of fielded Information Systems including the Joint Effects Model (JEM) and the Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN). This project also provides for the Software Support Activity (SSA). Efforts included in this project are: (1) Joint Effects Model (JEM) IT Box; (2) the Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN) IT Box; and (3) Software Support Activity (SSA). JEM and JWARN will utilize the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) Manual prescribed Agile Information Technology Box \"IT Box\" construct for managing requirements for the follow-on increments of capability development. Use of the \"IT Box\" acquisition approach increases flexibility and will expedite fielding of Information System products through a series of Build Decisions (BDs) versus less frequent traditional DoD Milestone B and C decisions. Each program will use an Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document (IS ICD) to describe the required operational capabilities for the development effort. JEM's IS ICD was approved by the Joint Staff J8 Joint Requirements Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense (JRO-CBRND) in September 2013 and JWARN's IS ICD will be reviewed for approval in 2QFY14. After the IS ICD is approved, more detailed requirements will be captured in Requirements Definition Packages (RDP) and will be approved at the Functional Capability Board (FCB) level. In order to support an agile incremental approach, each program will ensure that the \"IT Box\" describes the entire IT program and not just a single increment. The supporting BDs will ensure incorporation of mature technology and development efforts culminating in incremental deliveries of capability to Joint and Service Command and Control (C2) architectures. These limited fielding efforts are based on providing capabilities with the most value to the operators based on Warfighter priorities/needs, maturation of the technology being incorporated and available resources supporting the effort. As software-intensive systems both JEM and JWARN have no separately identifiable unit production components. Both are designated ACAT III programs and unit cost calculations including Program Acquisition Unit Cost/Average Procurement Unit Cost (PAUC/APUC) and Operations and Sustainment (O&S) average annual per unit costs are not applicable. The Joint Effects Model (JEM) is the DoD's only accredited model that has been operationally tested and deemed effective for predicting hazards associated with the release of contaminants into the environment. JEM is a software-only, ACAT III program that was originally developed as an increment 1 and is continuing development using the agile \"IT Box\" process described above. JEM is currently capable of modeling hazards in a variety of scenarios including: counterforce, passive defense, accident and/or incidents; high altitude releases, incident source prediction to include Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) events, urban CBRN/Toxic Industrial Hazard environments, human inhalation, contagious/infectious disease, population movements, efficacy of medical countermeasures, industrial transport; building interiors, and human performance degradation. Battlespace commanders and first responders must have a CBRN hazard prediction capability in order to make decisions that will Volume 4 - 275UNCLASSIFIED PE 0607384BP: CHEMICAL/BIOLOGICAL DEFENSE (OP SYS DEV) UNCLASSIFIED Chemical and Biological Defense Program Page 16 of 38 R-1 Line #184Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2015 Chemical and Biological Defense Program Date: March 2014 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 7R-1 Program (OP SYS DEV)Project (Number/Name) IS7 / INFORMATION SYSTEMS (OP SYS DEV) minimize risks of CBRN contamination and enable them to continue mission operations. JEM operates in an integrated fashion with operational and tactical Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems, and in a standalone mode. JEM interfaces and communicates with the other programs such as JWARN, weather systems, intelligence systems, and various databases. JEM IT Box adds capability to JEM Increment 1 including modeling of missile intercepts and improved modeling of hazard events in urban and littoral terrain. The IT Box version of JEM also includes improved architecture called Common CBRN Modeling Interface (CCMI). Together, CCMI and IT Box enable more rapid and less costly integration of Science and Technology updates, aligning with the S&T provider to provide the most current capability to the warfighter. JEM Increment 2, using IT Box Acquisition Strategy, adds capability to JEM Increment 1 including modeling of missile intercepts and improved modeling of hazard events in urban and littoral terrain. It also includes improved architecture called Common CBRN Modeling Interface (CCMI). Together, CCMI and IT Box enable more rapid and less costly integration of Science and Technology updates, aligning with the S&T provider to provide the most current capability to the warfighter. Battlespace commanders and first responders must have a CBRN hazard prediction capability in order to make decisions that will minimize risks of CBRN contamination and enable them to continue mission operations. JEM operates in an integrated fashion with operational and tactical Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems, and in a standalone mode. JEM interfaces and communicates with the other programs such as JWARN, weather systems, intelligence systems, and various databases. The Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN) provides the Joint Forces with a comprehensive Early Warning (EW) analysis and response capability to minimize the effects of hostile Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) attacks, incidents and accidents. It provides the operational capability to employ CBRN warning technology which will collect, analyze, identify, locate, report, and disseminate CBRN warnings. JWARN will transition from a Command and Control (C2) platform specific implementation to a Web-based Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) meeting the DoD's evolution to a more comprehensive Common Operating Environment (COE). JWARN Increment 2 will provide an expansion of sensors that will connect to JWARN, increased automation of message handling, improved false alarm filtering, integration of route-planning calculator, and interoperability with additional Command and Control (C2), medical information and evolving Bio-Surveillance systems. JWARN will be located in Command and Control Centers at the appropriate level and will be employed by CBRN defense specialists and other designated personnel to improve the efficiency of limited CBRN personnel assets. This employment will transfer data automatically from existing sensors and to and from the future sensors to provide commanders with the capability to support operational decision making in a CBRN environment. JWARN will integrate existing sensors into a sensor network or host C2 system, but does not provide the sensors that will be employed in the operating environment. JWARN will be compatible and integrated with Joint Services Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Systems and will operate as a standalone capability in the next increment of development. Activities include: logistical elements, support equipment, manuals and training required to operate and support the system. The Software Support Activity (SSA) is a Chem-Bio Defense user developmental support and service organization to facilitate net-centric interoperability of systems in acquisition for the Warfighter. The SSA provides the CBRN Warfighter with Joint Service solutions for Integrated Architectures, Data Management/Modeling, Information Assurance (IA), Interoperability Certifications, Verification, Validation and Accreditation (VV&A) to support interoperable and integrated net-centric, service-oriented solutions for CBRN systems. The SSA emphasizes development of reference implementations to guide Government and industry system and software developers to ensure that their products meet common interoperability standards. The latest technologies/products include the definition of a Common CBRN Sensor Integration Standard (CCSI) and the CBRN Data Model. These technologies and direct enablers for the development of CBRN integrated sensor networks and the dissemination Volume 4 - 276UNCLASSIFIED PE 0607384BP: CHEMICAL/BIOLOGICAL DEFENSE (OP SYS DEV) UNCLASSIFIED Chemical and Biological Defense Program Page 17 of 38 R-1 Line #184Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2015 Chemical and Biological Defense Program Date: March 2014 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 7R-1 Program (OP SYS DEV)Project (Number/Name) IS7 / INFORMATION SYSTEMS (OP SYS DEV) of CBRN information across all users. The SSA directly supports Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP) initiatives by providing common service oriented architectures and frameworks for the collection and dissemination of Bio-Surveillance and other critical CBRN information.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification This Project provides for the upgrade and modernization of fielded Medical Biological defense equipment/systems including the Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS). JBAIDS is a commercial off-the-shelf development/production effort started in August 2003 that focused on rapid development and fielding efforts to deliver a critical capability to identify bacterial and viral agents in environmental surveillance and clinical specimen sample types. By 2005, 16 biological warfare (BW) agent surveillance detection kits were fielded along with the first JBAIDS in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assay cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). JBAIDS currently has seven IVD kits cleared by the FDA, JBAIDS achieved full operational capability (340 systems delivered all Services) in July 2011. JBAIDS efforts in 2012-2015 will focus on adding surveillance food and water pathogen detection assays. Also, the development team will focus on completing Pre-Emergency Use Authorization (Pre-EUA's) packages annually for FDA review. The operational development RDT&E funds will be used to oversee the configuration management of the system to include the conduct of annual software security information assurance (IA) updates on fielded software and monitor analyzer/laptop parts obsolescence. The NGDS is envisioned to be an evolutionary acquisition family of systems to provide increments of capability over time across many echelons of the Combat Health Support System. The mission of the NGDS is to provide CBRN warfare threat identification and FDA-cleared diagnostics to inform individual patient treatment, CBRN situational awareness, and disease surveillance. NGDS Increment 1 Deployable Component will significantly improve diagnostic capabilities for deployable combat health support units (role 3) while also improving operational suitability and affordability. The term \"Role\" is used to describe the stratification of the four tiers in which medical support is organized, on a progressive basis, to conduct treatment, evacuation, resupply, and functions essential to the maintenance of the health of the force. Role 3 support is normally provided at Division or Service equivalent level and includes specialist laboratory resources. The NGDS Increment 1 Deployable Component is intended to replace the legacy Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) beginning in FY17. The NGDS Increment 1 Service Laboratory Component is intended to provide high throughput Biological threat identification, characterization and diagnostics to fixed site CONUS and OCONUS laboratories operated by the Army, Navy and Air Force in coordination with the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center. NGDS Increment 2 is intended to provide advanced diagnostics for biological pathogens and toxins, diagnostics for chemical and radiological exposures and to provide capability to lower echelons of care.
