Typhi). Routine typhoid vaccination is not recommended in the United States. Selective immunization against typhoid fever is recommended for the following groups: Travelers to areas in which there is a recognized risk of exposure to S. Typhi Persons with intimate exposure (eg, household contact) to an S. Typhi carrier Microbiology laboratory workers who frequently handle S. Typhi There is no evidence to support the use of typhoid vaccine to control common source outbreaks, disease following natural disasters, or in persons attending rural summer camps. Not all recipients of VIVOTIF will be fully protected against typhoid fever. Vaccinated individuals should continue to take personal precautions against exposure to typhoid organisms. The vaccine will not afford protection against species of Salmonella other than Salmonella Typhi or other bacteria that cause enteric disease. The vaccine is not suitable for treatment of acute infections with S. Typhi. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends typhoid vaccination for travelers to parts of the world where typhoid is common, people in close contact with a typhoid carrier, and laboratory workers who work with S. Typhi bacteria.2 To read the full recommendation and see the most recent updates, visit the CDC website. [CDC Recommendation](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/typhoid.html) Established Efficacy1 The efficacy of VIVOTIF was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, controlled field trial conducted in Santiago, Chile. Results showed that adults and children older than 6 years of age may be protected against typhoid fever following the oral ingestion of 4 doses of VIVOTIF. Objective and vaccine schedule Study evaluated the relative efficacy of 2, 3, or 4 doses of VIVOTIF administered on alternate days in 189,819 school-aged children. Results - After comparing disease incidence within the 3 groups, relative vaccine efficacy was highest in the 4-dose group |Dosing regimen||Incidence per complete immunization schedule for VIVOTIF consists of 4 capsules with 1 capsule taken on alternate days (eg, days 1, 3, 5, and 7). Immune response The precise mechanism(s) by which VIVOTIF provides protection against typhoid fever is unknown. However, it is known that immunization of adult subjects can elicit an antibody response against S. Typhi. An open study comparing levels of anti-S. Typhi antibodies between adults living in an endemic area (Chile) and nonendemic areas (United States and Switzerland) showed comparable seroconversion rates between these groups. Challenge studies in North American volunteers have shown that the Ty21a strain is capable of providing significant protection to an experimental challenge of S. Typhi. Because of the very low incidence of typhoid fever in US citizens, efficacy studies are not currently feasible in this population; however, the above observations support the expectation that 4 doses of VIVOTIF will provide protection to recipients from non-typhoid-endemic areas such as the United States. Duration of efficacy - Efficacy of VIVOTIF has been shown to persist for at least 5 years - It is recommended that reimmunization be given every 5 years under conditions of repeated or continued exposure to typhoid fever - There is no experience with VIVOTIF as a booster in persons previously immunized with parenteral typhoid vaccine - The optimum booster schedule for VIVOTIF has not been determined Safety Profile1 Adverse reactions Active surveillance for adverse reactions of enteric-coated capsules was performed in a pilot study and in a subgroup of a large field trial involving a total of 483 individuals receiving 3 vaccine doses. Adverse reactions Symptom rate (%) N=483 aNausea occurred at a statistically higher frequency in the vaccinated group as compared to the placebo group. Postmarketing surveillance Adverse reactions reported between 1991 and 1995, during which time more than 60 million doses (capsules) were administered, included diarrhea (n=45), abdominal pain (n=42), nausea (n=35), fever (n=34), headache (n=26), skin rash (n=26), vomiting (n=18), or urticaria in the trunk and/or extremities (n=13). One isolated, nonfatal anaphylactic shock, which was considered to be an allergic reaction to the vaccine was reported. Dosage and Administration1 Dosage and administration instructions should be explained carefully to help patients stay on course with VIVOTIF. One capsule taken on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 may provide up to 5 years of protection against typhoid fever. A complete immunization schedule is the ingestion of 4 vaccine capsules as described above. Dos and Don'ts of Taking VIVOTIF1 In order to ensure your patients know how to take VIVOTIF appropriately, be sure to share the following tips during consultations: DO - Complete the course of VIVOTIF at least 1 week before potential exposure to S. Typhi - Keep the capsules refrigerated (35.6\u00b0F-46.6\u00b0F) - The vaccine capsule should be swallowed approximately 1 hour before a meal with cold or lukewarm [temperature not to exceed body temperature, eg, 98.6\u00b0F] drink - Swallow the vaccine capsule as soon after placing in the mouth as possible - Inspect the blister containing the vaccine capsules to ensure that the foil seal and capsules are intact DON'T DON'T take with sulfonamides or antibiotics DON'T open or chew the capsules DON'T freeze the capsules Administering oral polio or yellow fever vaccines at the same time as VIVOTIF does not suppress the immune response triggered by VIVOTIF.

How Supplied/Storage and Handling1 How supplied1 VIVOTIF is supplied in a single foil blister containing 4 doses of vaccine in a single package. Storage and handling1 - VIVOTIF is not stable when exposed to ambient temperatures, so VIVOTIF should be shipped and stored between 35.6\u00b0F-46.6\u00b0F - Each package of vaccine shows an expiration date. This expiration date is valid only if the product has been maintained at the proper temperature - VIVOTIF must be refrigerated between 35.6\u00b0F-46.6\u00b0F to maintain optimal potency For medical inquiries regarding temperature deviations by patients, please contact Medical Information at (800) 533-5899 or [medicalinformation@ebsi.com](mailto:medicalinformation@ebsi.com).

[View Now](/support/) Important Safety Information Indication and Usage VIVOTIF is indicated for immunization of adults and children greater than 6 years of age against disease caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi. Routine typhoid vaccination is not recommended in the United States of America. Selective immunization against typhoid fever is recommended for the following groups: 1) travelers to areas in which there is a recognized risk of exposure to S. Typhi; 2) persons with intimate exposure (e.g., household contact) to an S. Typhi carrier; and 3) microbiology laboratorians who work frequently with S. Typhi. There is no evidence to support the use of typhoid vaccine to control common source outbreaks, disease following natural disasters, or in persons attending rural summer camps. Not all recipients of VIVOTIF will be fully protected against typhoid fever. Vaccinated individuals should continue to take personal precautions against exposure to typhoid organisms. The vaccine will not afford protection against species of Salmonella other than Salmonella Typhi or other bacteria that cause enteric disease. The vaccine is not suitable for treatment of acute infections with S. Typhi. Important Safety Information VIVOTIF is contraindicated in patients with a hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine or the enteric-coated capsule. The vaccine should not be administered to persons during an acute febrile illness. Safety of the vaccine has not been demonstrated in persons deficient in their ability to mount a humoral or cell-mediated immune response, due to either a congenital or acquired immunodeficient state including treatment with immunosuppressive or antimitotic drugs. The vaccine should not be administered to these persons regardless of benefits. Acute Gastrointestinal Illness: VIVOTIF is not to be taken during an acute gastrointestinal illness. Postpone taking the vaccine if persistent diarrhea or vomiting occurs. Concomitant Administration with Sulfonamides and Antibiotics: The vaccine should not be administered to individuals receiving sulfonamides and antibiotics since these agents may be active against the vaccine strain and prevent a sufficient degree of multiplication to occur in order to induce a protective immune response. Diminished Immune Response: Unless a complete immunization schedule is followed, an optimum immune response may not be achieved. Not all recipients of VIVOTIF will be fully protected against typhoid fever. Personal Precautions: Vaccinated individuals should continue to take personal precautions against exposure to typhoid organisms (i.e., travelers should take all necessary precautions to avoid contact or ingestion of potentially contaminated food or water). Concomitant Administration with Anti-malarial Drugs: Several anti-malaria drugs, such as mefloquine, chloroquine and proguanil (not approved for use in US) possess anti-bacterial activity which may interfere with the immunogenicity of VIVOTIF. A study showed that mefloquine and chloroquine can be administered together with VIVOTIF. Proguanil should be administered only if 10 days or more have elapsed since the final dose of VIVOTIF was ingested. Adverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions in clinical trials were abdominal pain (6.4%), nausea (5.8%), headache (4.8%), fever (3.3%), diarrhea (2.9%), vomiting (1.5%) and skin rash (1.0%). Only the incidence of nausea occurred at a statistically higher frequency in the vaccinated group as compared to the placebo group.
