Herbal Supplements: Natural Way to Support Whole Body Health If you have recently been diagnosed with cancer, you may be curious as to how traditional Chinese herbs can play a role in treatment. A common refrain heard by some individuals during the treatment process is \"if the cancer doesn't kill you, the biomedical treatments will.\" While some chemotherapy treatments can be very effective, Chinese medicine and acupuncture understands that not all patients are good candidates for chemotherapy, especially if their immune system has been severely weakened. Chinese medicine can be beneficial for supplementing a patient's overall health and boosting the immune system by restoring underlying balance to an individual. Natural remedies can also be useful in: (1) offsetting the damaging effects of radiation and chemotherapy; (2) supporting the patient's immune system (which can be overwhelmed by biomedical treatments); and (3) helping to reduce the size of the tumor, which then shortens the length of time that a patient needs to receive chemotherapy and/or radiation treatment. Common Chinese herbs that are used in cancer treatment include Oldenlandia (treating stomach, esophageal and colon cancer), Selaginaella (treating lung and throat cancer), Sophora Root (treating cervical cancer), Zedoania (treating cervical cancer), Rhubarb Root and Rhizome (inhibiting the growth of melanoma and breast cancer tumors). Chinese herbal supplements are also beneficial for boosting overall mental health. For example, some traditional Chinese medicines may help patients who have been diagnosed with depression and are currently taking antidepressants like Prozac, Zoloft, and Paxil. Controlling depression with pharmaceuticals can require weeks or months of experimenting with drugs at different dosages to find the right combination for patients. During this \"experimentation\" period, it is natural for patients to feel frustrated and overwhelmed, especially by the different side effects caused by these medications. When practiced properly, Chinese herbal medicine does not cause these side effects. While there are serious situations where certain pharmaceutical medications may be absolutely essential, for many other patients, a combination of acupuncture and Chinese herbs may actually be able to produce the most beneficial results. This is because holistic medicine integrates the body and mind in its diagnostic process and treatment strategies, making it a viable solution for the treatment of depression. Herbal supplements and teas can be an important addition to natural, holistic healthy living.
