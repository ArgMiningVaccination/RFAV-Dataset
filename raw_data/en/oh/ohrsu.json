Telephone interviews were conducted with a random sample of 1,745 Canadian pa rents, screening for those who had at least one chi ld under the age of 18. Interview questions investigat ed Canadian parents' knowledge, awareness, attitude s and behaviours related to immunization. Findings fro m this research will be used to inform public educa tion strategies and initiatives. Incidence of Immunization Nine in ten parents indicated that their child's i mmunizations are up to date, while one in ten reported that their child had missed at least one o f the recommended vaccines. The most commonly misse d vaccines include: seasonal flu, chicken pox, Hepati tis B and MMR. Twenty-eight per cent of parents who say their child has missed an immunization feel tha t vaccines are unnecessary, arguing instead that th e human body is fully capable of caring for itself. S ixteen per cent of parents within this segment do n ot believe in vaccine use, either for philosophical re asons or as a consequence of religious beliefs, and a similar proportion has concerns about the safety of vaccines. The survey also explored the incidence of HPV immun ization and parents' attitudes toward this vaccine in particular. Of households where the re is at least one girl of eligible age in her prov ince to receive the HPV vaccine, approximately half reporte d that their daughter had received the vaccine. Ano ther 31 per cent of parents, who had not yet had their d aughter immunized, indicated that they would do so in the future. For most parents, protection against cancer is the primary driver of the decision to immunize a gainst HPV. Finally, the survey also explored the incidence of H1N1 immunization. Half of parents indicated that their child had received the H1N1 va ccine. A similar proportion (44%) reported that the y would be highly likely to have their child immunized in t he event of a new global flu pandemic; a further 33 per cent stated that they would be moderately likely and the remainder indicated a low likelihood (22%). Perceptions Regarding Immunization Parents reported various levels of familiarity wit h childhood vaccines, with half of respondents reporting high familiarity and a similar proportion reporting moderate familiarity. Only six per cent of parents feel their knowledge about childhood vaccines is re latively limited. Nine in ten parents believe childhood vaccines in general are effective and important for their child's health. The childhood vaccines for tetanus/ diphtheria/Hib/pertussis/polio, meningococcal disea se, measles/mumps/rubella and pneumococcal disease in p articular are seen as highly important. The vaccines iv EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2011 for human papillomavirus (HPV) and chicken pox are deemed highly important by about half of parents. Parents are divided regarding the importance of the seasonal flu vaccine: one-quarter feels this vacci ne is highly important, and another quarter feels it is o f little or no importance, with the remainder deemi ng the vaccine moderately important. Most parents are confident in the safety of childh ood vaccines, with 65 per cent of parents rating them as highly safe, 30 per cent rating them as moderately safe and very few saying that they a re unsafe. By comparison, parents expressed greater ca ution with regard to the safety of prescription dru gs and over the counter medicines. Parents are conside rably more concerned with the safety of natural hea lth products, with just one in four rating these as saf e. Nonetheless, in response to other lines of inqui ry, some safety concerns were expressed with respect to vacc ines. In particular, half of parents indicated conc ern that newer vaccines are not as safe as older vaccin es. Four in ten parents are more concerned about the safety of vaccines now than five years ago and a si milar proportion agrees that adverse reactions to vaccines don't get enough attention in the media. A third of parents feel that children today receive too many vaccines. Information and Decision-Making Process Parents feel that they are well-equipped to make i nformed decisions when it comes to having their child immunized, as more than eight in ten sa y they have enough information. Parents generally reported that they had little difficulty in making the decision to immunize their child in the past. Th at said, one in ten respondents felt that decisions to immun ize their child had been difficult, expressing conc erns over possible side effects of immunizations and con troversial or conflicting evidence about vaccines presented by the media. Parents who do not feel tha t they have enough information to make informed decisions when it comes to immunizations are most o ften looking for information that will enable them to assess the risks and side effects associated with t he vaccine, as well as the risks associated with th e disease it protects against. Most parents have searched for information regardi ng childhood vaccines. Sources that are most popular among these parents are Internet-based sources and physicians. Parents who have used the Internet to seek information most commonly used a g eneral Google web search, or consulted various government websites, including Health Canada and pr ovincial or Government of Canada websites generally. Despite the widespread use of the Intern et to search for vaccine information, only one quar ter of parents see the Internet as their most reliable and trustworthy source of information. Rather, most pa rents cite physicians as most reliable and trustworthy (6 8 per cent). This is consistent with the finding tha t six in ten parents believe there is considerable misinform ation about vaccines on the Internet, while only ha lf feel that the Internet is giving parents access to good information to make decisions regarding immunizatio n. Almost half of parents have had a discussion with a health care professional about a concern related to immunization. Of these, one-third indica ted concerns about potential side effects and a fur ther 15 per cent questioned the necessity of getting the vaccine in question. With regard to outcome, 68 pe r cent of those with concerns ultimately had their child i mmunized while twenty-three per cent did not. In fa ct, most EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2011 v parents surveyed agreed that they usually follow th e advice of their child's doctor or nurse and that health care providers clearly explain the risks and benefi ts of vaccines Only four per cent of parents in the survey (74 pa rents) reported adverse reactions to a vaccine. The most frequently reported reactions incl uded fever, tiredness, redness, swelling or hives. Just over half of all Canadian parents are aware that ad verse reactions are tracked in Canada, although the re is confusion as to how this is done. Thirty-six per cen t of parents indicated high confidence in the syste m for tracking these side effects, with six in ten saying they are moderately confident; few parents describ ed themselves as not confident. Patterns of Awareness, Perceptions and Information Needs While most parents feel well equipped to make deci sions related to immunization of their children, and while most believe that immunization is important, safe, and effective, there is a small er group of parents, who believes that they do not have enou gh information, are confused, or generally have dou bts about the need, safety and effectiveness of immuniz ation for their children. This is typically more pr evalent among some parent segments. In some cases, parents feel less familiar with the issue and less well- equipped to make the decision, expressing concerns about inadequate or inconsistent information. There is also a segment with doubts about the need and effec tiveness of vaccines, although they typically do no t express confusion or a need for more information ab out the issue. The cost of this research was $144,600 plus HST.

INTRODUCTION 1.1 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Despite exhaustive scientific evidence that immuni zations are amongst the safest and most cost-effective public health measures, achievement and maintenance of high levels of immunization coverage has remained a challenge. Recommended immu nizations for Canadians change over time. At different stages, parents, adolescents, adults and seniors require information to make informed decisi ons regarding immunization. Thus, ongoing renewal of str ategic and comprehensive approaches to immunization education and promotion are required t o ensure public acceptance of the recommended immunizations and confidence in immunization provid ers and in the continued success of immunization programs in Canada. Quantitative research is requir ed with parents of children under the age of 18 in order to understand what the information needs are for pa rticular segments, and how best to communicate the information. The results will also form a baseline a gainst which to track the effectiveness of future communications with this target group. Specific objectives of the survey are to: evaluate parents' attitudes, awareness and knowledg e levels around immunization including the issues of vaccine safety, efficacy and importan ce; assess their level of knowledge and confidence in t he current system used to report adverse reactions; determine parents' barriers and motivators with res pect to immunization of their children; determine Canadians' information sources as well as the preferred communication medium of Canadians; and obtain immunization status of their child with spec ific reference to the HPV vaccine. 1.2 METHODOLOGY A random sample of 1,745 Canadian parents of child ren under the age of 18 was included in the survey. The sample was based on randomly selecte d households from across the country, using a Random Digit Dial (RDD) method of sampling househol ds. The survey instrument included roughly 70 items and the questionnaire required an average of 18.5 m inutes for parents to complete. Prior to conducting the survey, the survey instrum ent was tested with 15 cases in English and 15 cases in French. Testing was done in iterations, w ith changes made after the first ten and then again after 20, to ensure that any changes addressed the difficulties experienced in the first test intervie ws. The 2 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2011 testing was monitored by the Project Manager, who w as also responsible for outlining the changes. Clie nt representatives also listened to audio files from t he pretest and contributed to the discussion regard ing need for any potential changes. Once started, the survey was monitored for sample efficiency (e.g., rotation and number of call-backs) and quotas, as well as for general data quality. The survey was collected over three weeks in March, 2011. Each household entered into the sample was attempted up to eight times before retiring th e telephone number and attempts were spread over the data collection period. The response rate of the survey was 23 per cent. Prior to analysis, the database was reviewed for d ata quality, outliers, coding requirements, weighting and construction of independent variables used to explore sub-group patterns (e.g., by age, age of children, gender and so on) in the analysis. Fol lowing this review and treatment of the data, a dec k of the topline results was created (within a few days afte r the survey was completed), illustrating national results graphically. A series of detailed tables was also p rovided with the deck featuring the results for a v ariety of sub-groups (income level, province/territory, age a nd number of children in the home, etc). EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2011 3 2. FAMILIARITY AND IMPORTANCE 2.1 FAMILIARITY WITH CHILDHOOD IMMUNIZATIONS In terms of familiarity with recommended childhood immunizations, parents reported various levels of familiarity. Half of respondents (50 per cent) reported they are highly familiar with these vaccines (i.e., 6 or 7 on a 7-point scale). A similar propor tion (43 per cent) said they are moderately familia r (3, 4, or 5 on a 7-point scale). Fewer than one in ten responden ts (six per cent) feels their knowledge is relative ly limited (1 or 2 on a 7-point scale). Vaccine Safety Survey, 2011 EKOS Research Associates Inc. Familiarity with Childhood Immunizations 50% 6% 43% Not familiar (1-2) Moderately familiar (3-5) Highly familiar (6-7)\"To what extent would you say that you are familiar with recommended childhood immunizations, that is, which shots are given when a nd for what?\" n=1745 Parents of young children (under 5 years) are more likely than other parents to consider themselves very familiar with childhood immunizatio ns, particularly those whose children have had a side effect or adverse reaction to a medicati on. Regionally, parents in Alberta are somewhat more li kely to feel they are very familiar than others in Canada, while those in Atlantic Canada in dicate slightly less familiarity than the national average. 4 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2011 Familiarity with vaccines increases with education o f parents. The most educated parents (i.e., a graduate degree) more often reported themselves t o be very familiar with vaccines, while those with the least education reported the least f amiliarity. Those without a family doctor are slightly more like ly to rank their familiarity as low than parents with a family doctor. Anglophones are slightly more likely than other par ents to provide a high rating for their familiarity. 2.2 RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF DIFFERENT VACCINES Respondents were presented with a list of childhoo d vaccines and asked to rate the importance of each one. Results reveal that most of these vaccines are seen by the majority of parents as highly important, although the seasonal flu vaccine is least likely to be deemed important. Fully 80 pe r cent of parents feel that the tetanus/diphtheria/Hib/per tussis/polio vaccine is highly important, and three -quarters rated the vaccine to prevent meningococcal disease (76 per cent) and the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine (75 per cent) as highly important. Two-third s of respondents feel that the vaccines to prevent pneumococcal disease and Hepatitis B are highly imp ortant (67 and 68 per cent, respectively). Fewer parents rate the importance of the vaccines for hum an papillomavirus (HPV) and chicken pox as high: in these cases only half of parents rated them as high ly important (52 per cent and 51 per cent, respecti vely). There is considerable divide as to whether seasonal flu vaccines are important: i.e., 26 per cent rated these as highly important, compared with 27 per cent who say they are of little to no importance, with 46 pe r cent providing a moderate rating.

Residents of Quebec stand out as being somewhat les s likely to view the flu vaccine as important than the national average Residents of Saskatchewan and Manitoba are less lik ely than the national average to rate the chicken pox vaccine as important. Those in the terri tories are less apt to rate the vaccine to prevent pneumococcal disease as important. Parents who say they are familiar with childhood im munizations are more likely than other parents to believe in the importance of all of thes e vaccines. Those with a family doctor are more likely to feel v accines are important, particularly the vaccines for MMR, chicken pox, pneumococcal disease and meningococcal disease, as well as seasonal flu. Those without a family doctor are m ore apt to say that seasonal flu vaccines, in particular, are not important. Parents in the highest income category ($120,000+) are much more likely than parents reporting lesser incomes to rank the MMR vaccine as very important. On the other hand, it is parents with less education who are more likely tha n those with more education to rank the HPV, Hepatitis B and chicken pox vaccines as very i mportant. Those in the lowest income and education categories are more likely than other par ents to believe in the importance of seasonal flu vaccines. In the case of HPV, parents who have pre-teen/early adolescent children (ages 10-14) are more likely than those with younger children to bel ieve that the vaccine is very important. The age of the parent does not play a great role in determining whether they feel strongly about a vaccine's importance, except in the case of chicken pox, where older parents (45 and over) are much more likely than younger parents to believe the vaccine is very important, as well as in the case of seasonal flu, but to a lesse r extent. The reverse is true for the pneumococcal vaccine; where parents under 35 are th e most likely to feel it is very important, relative to older parents. Parents who were not born in Canada are more likely to rate the importance of the HPV vaccine as low compared to parents born in Canada. On the other hand, they are more positive than other parents about the importance of the chicken pox vaccine. 6 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2011 2.3 PERCEPTIONS REGARDING IMPORTANCE AND EFFECTIVENESS OF IMMUNIZATION Nine in ten parents believe childhood vaccines are important for their child's health (88 per cent) and think childhood vaccines are effective (8 6 per cent). There is a small group of parents (12 t o 15 per cent), however, who are less convinced, althoug h only five per cent actually disagree in each case . Vaccine Safety Survey, 2011 EKOS Research Associates Inc.

Agreement that vaccines are effective is more prono unced among older parents (40- 44, in particular), parents with a family doctor, those wh o consider themselves familiar with immunizations, and families with no history of a ch ild experiencing an adverse reaction to medications, relative to other parents. Regionally, belief in the effectiveness of vaccines is lowest in British Columbia, relative to the national average, although the majority in that pro vince (79 per cent) agrees that childhood vaccines are effective. EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2011 7 3. IMMUNIZATION DECISION 3.1 INCIDENCE OF IMMUNIZATION Parents were asked whether their child had receive d all of the vaccines that are recommended for children their age. Results indicate a high rat e of compliance with immunization schedules, with 8 9 per cent of parents stating that their children are up to date. That said, ten per cent of parents reporte d their child had missed at least one of the recommended va ccines and one per cent of respondents are uncertai n. The most commonly missed vaccines cited were for se asonal flu (listed by 43 per cent), HPV (43 per cent) and chicken pox (42 per cent). One-th ird of parents also named the Hepatitis B vaccine (31 per cent). Thirty per cent of all parents cited the MMR as a missed vaccine. Another one-quarter li sted the vaccines to prevent pneumococcal disease (26 pe r cent) and meningococcal disease (27 per cent). Twenty-one per cent of parents who reported missing vaccines said their child had not been given the tetanus/diphtheria/Hib/pertussis/polio vaccine. Sev enteen per cent were uncertain about which vaccines their child had missed. Vaccine Safety Survey, 2011 EKOS Research Associates Inc. 10% 89% 1% Yes No DK/NR Incidence of Immunization \"Has your child received all of the vaccines that are recommended for children up to \"Which vaccine or vaccines didn't your receive?\" Hepatitis B Vaccine for chicken pox n=1745 n=167 8 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2011 Residents of Saskatchewan and Manitoba (84 per cent across the two provinces combined) are slightly less likely than others across the cou ntry to say their child has received all of the recommended immunizations for their age. Quebecers are slightly more likely to report that their children have received all of their immunizat ions relative to the national average (92 per cent compared with 89 per cent for the country over all). Parents who have young children (less than 5 years) are more likely to say their child has not yet received the MMR vaccine or the chicken pox vac cine. Parents of older children are considerably more likely to have listed the HPV vac cine as one their child has missed. 3.2 REASONS FOR NON -IMMUNIZATION Parents reporting that their children have not rec eived all of the recommended vaccines were asked why this was the case. Just over one in five of these respondents (28 per cent) said that vaccin es are unnecessary, arguing instead that the human body is fully capable of caring for itself. This represents three per cent of all parents (based on the full sample). Sixteen per cent do not believe in vaccine use, ei ther for philosophical reasons or as a consequence of religi ous beliefs, and a similar proportion (17 per cent) raise concerns about the safety of vaccines. One in ten ( 12 per cent) of these parents believes that vaccine s carry too many negative side effects to justify their use . A small percentage (nine per cent) intends to hav e their child immunized in the future. Each of these segmen ts represents between one and two per cent of all parents (based on the full sample). Fewer respondents cited ineffectiveness of vaccines (seven per cent), too many vaccines, lack of trust in the industry (three per cent each) and forgetting to obtain the vaccine (two per cent). Ot her responses were provided with even less frequency. EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2011 9 Vaccine Safety Survey, 2011 EKOS the reasons your child was not im munized?\" Concerns about vaccine safety Vaccines are not effective Not yet, but planning to Too many side effects Don't believe in them Other n=167 Too many immunizations required Don't trust the pharmaceutical industry Only items with 3% or more shown on slide Vaccines are not necessary Did not remember/forgot Parents of children under five years of age are mor e likely to cite too many side effects as a reason for not immunizing a child. 3.3 DIFFICULTY OF DECISION TO IMMUNIZE Study findings indicate that Canadian parents gene rally perceive little difficulty in making the decision to immunize their child, with 89 per cent of respondents rating the decision making process a s easy (including 37 per cent who rated it as very easy). That said, one in ten respondents (11 per cent) feel s the decisions were difficult. This is higher among paren ts who reported that their children are not up to d ate with the required vaccines (where 35 per cent said they have found these decisions to be difficult or very difficult). The same pattern is true among parents w ho do not see vaccines as particularly important or effective. The relatively small number of respondents who indi cated that the decision to immunize their child was difficult (n=176) were asked to elaborate on their answers. These parents offered a wide rang e of explanations, although the most common responses in cluded concerns over possible side effects (22 per cent) and controversial or conflicting evidence in the media (18 per cent). This represents roughly tw o per cent of all parents in each case (based on the full sample of parents). Other explanations were cited by small numbers of parents and are presented for info rmation (i.e., they may not be representative of th is segment of parents). These explanations included unc ertainty in general (14 per cent), a lack of inform ation (12 per cent), and doubts as to whether the vaccine s are necessary or truly effective (nine per cent); a further six per cent of respondents were concerned that there has not been enough testing done on 10 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2011 vaccines. Eight per cent cited that the experience of a child's adverse reaction to a past immunizatio n made future decisions difficult. Another eight per cent cited links to autism. Seventeen per cent provided some other reason. These reasons were each cited by less than five per cent and include: Access barriers: cost, access to vaccine or doctors , ability to get an appointment Differing opinions within the household Difficulty getting child to cooperate (e.g., fear o f needles, tantrums) Prefer not to take it (e.g., body can take care of itself) Vaccine Safety Survey, 2011 EKOS Research Associates Inc.

Those in the highest income category ($120,000+) are more likely than others to have found these decisions to be very easy to make. Among the small number of parents who have found th ese decisions to be very difficult, those most likely to feel this way are residents of Briti sh Columbia, and those who have a child who has experienced a bad reaction to a medication. EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2011 11 3.4 DECISIONS REGARDING THE HPV VACCINE Looking specifically at the incidence of HPV immun ization, of households in the sample where there is at least one girl of an eligible age in he r province to receive the HPV vaccine, roughly half (49 per cent) reported that their daughter received the HPV vaccine. Another thirty one per cent of parents wh ose daughter had not yet received the vaccine said they will have their child immunized against HPV.

The reported incidence is lowest in Saskatchewan and Ma nitoba (combined), and also lower in some socio-economic cohorts (e.g., parents with inc omes in the ranges of $40,000-69,000). Among parents who have not yet had their daughter i mmunized, parents in Quebec (and as a consequence, French-speaking Canadians) are more lik ely than the national average to say their daughter will be getting the HPV vaccine in t he future. Anglophones and Ontario households stand out as more likely to say their da ughter will not be getting the vaccine, as are those households with a child who is 15 or olde r, relative to those with younger children. 12 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2011 For most parents, protection against cancer is the primary reason for the decision to immunize against HPV (parents were able to provide more than one reason): four in ten (41 per cent) said they w ant to protect their daughter from cervical cancer. Ano ther one in five said they had their daughter immun ized in order to protect her from vulvar and vaginal cancer s (20 per cent). Protection against genital warts w as another reason cited by 17 per cent. Other parents were led to the decision by health care workers or the school system. One in seven (14 per cent) attribute d their decision to the advice of their doctor or n urse. Nine per cent mentioned that the vaccine was being administered at school, and another two per cent st ated that the vaccine was routine or was being administe red to all girls in the province. Seven per cent pe rceived their child as being more at risk, and four per cen t just thought it was an important thing to do. Alt hough a small percentage, two per cent decided to go ahead with the immunization despite feeling that there wa s a lack of information and feeling pressured to do so. Other reasons cited, held by fewer than two per ce nt each, were that it is socially acceptable because m ost parents vaccinate their children, and that the adolescent herself made the decision to get immuniz ed.

Lack of information and concerns about safety are the primary barriers to HPV immunization cited by parents who had not yet had their daughter immunized. One in four parents indicated concern about safety (23 per cent). Twenty one per cent felt that more information is needed (i.e., more resear ch and testing needs to be done). For other parents it was simply a matter of timing: fourteen per cent of pa rents haven't had the chance to get their daughter vaccin ated yet, and a similar proportion (13 per cent) sa id their EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2011 13 daughter is just too young right now. Smaller propo rtions of parents are not clear on the need for the vaccine: twelve per cent feel that vaccines are not effective (12 per cent) and eleven per cent do not believe their child is at risk or that their lifestyle choi ces don't warrant the vaccine. Other reasons (each given by around five per cent of parents) include: financial barriers; they don't think getting the vaccine is necessary; they are concerned that the vaccine is too new; or no one had suggested it. Just three per cent said t hey had never thought about it before; another three pe r cent said it was the child's decision. Only two p er cent indicated a concern that getting the vaccine encour ages sexual activity.

Ontarians are also slightly more concerned about this than the national average. Residents of Quebec and Francophones are much more a pt than others across the country to feel that their daughter is too young to receive th e vaccine as are parents whose child is between 10 and 14 years old. Francophone parents are also more likely than other parents to have said their child has not been immunized becaus e they haven't had the opportunity. The small number of parents (N=83) who said they ha ve no intention of having their daughter immunized against HPV were asked, unprompted, to el aborate on their position. About a third listed concerns about safety while the remainder indicated a variety of responses. As the number of parents i n these subsets is very small, their responses are pr esented in the graph below for information and shou ld not be considered representative of all parents in this segment.

The anticipated rate of immunization is similar to the self-reported actual rate of immuniz ation against H1N1 (49 per cent). Forty-four per cen t of respondents say they would be highly likely to have their children immunized (i.e., 6 or 7 on a 7-poin t scale). One-third (33 per cent) say the likelihood would be moderate (i.e., 3, 4, or 5 on a 7-point scale). An other 22 per cent believe they would not be likely to tak e this route. Consistent with the overall anticipated rate of im munization, about 47 per cent of parents who reported that their children are up to date with th eir vaccines say that they would be highly likely t o have their children vaccinated for a new influenza virus , with 34 per cent saying the likelihood is moderat e and 18 per cent saying it would be low. Among parents who have not had all of the required vaccines administe red to their children, only 16 per cent say they would be highly likely to have their children immunized a gainst a new influenza virus. Highlighting that the influenz a vaccine is not deemed as important as other vacci nes, only about half of parents that rate vaccines overa ll as important, effective and safe, say they would be likely to vaccinate their children against a new strain of influenza. Among parents unlikely to have their children immu nized, the main reason for a quarter of parents is their belief that the vaccine is simply unnecessary. One in ten said that vaccines in gener al are not safe (12 per cent), and the same proportion sai d that the H1N1 vaccine itself is not safe (12 per cent), that they are concerned about potential side effect s (11 per cent), or that the risks do not warrant t he use of a vaccine (nine per cent). Further to this, one in t en (nine per cent) is mistrustful of information th at is out there or feels that they do not have enough informa tion to make the decision. One in seven (14 per cen t) expressed scepticism about either the effectiveness of vaccines in general or about the amount of test ing that has been done on vaccines. Fewer (four to six p er cent) said they don't need it, that there are ot her preventive methods one can use (e.g., alternative p ractices), that not all strains of the flu are prot ected by the vaccine, and that the effects of the flu aren't worth the trouble of getting the vaccine. One in f ive (19 per cent) provided other reasons that were less frequen tly cited (by two per cent or less), including: Not in a high risk group; Not around those at risk; Last time the child got a flu vaccine they got sick ; Child has illness, allergies, or other health conce rns; Don't trust the motives of drug companies; Concerned about Thimerosal or mercury in the vaccin e; There are too many vaccines now; Family member/friend experienced negative side effec ts. 16 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2011 Vaccine Safety Survey, Highly likely (6-7)H1N1 Immunization Intent and Rationale \"In the event of the global spread of a new influenza virus (like with the 2009 H1N1 outbreak) how likely would you be to have your children immunized against the virus?\" Healthy, risks do not warrant it Vaccines are not effective Concerned about side effects Vaccines are not safe Unnecessary OtherDon't need it[IF NOT LIKELY] \"Why would you choose NOT to have your children immunized against the virus?\" Not enough information H1N1 vaccine is not safe n=1745 n=470 All strains are not covered Mistrust of information/motives Other prevention methods Effects of flu not worth getting vaccine DK/NR Not enough testing Parents in Atlantic Canada, and, to a lesser extent , Alberta, are much more likely than average to have their children immunized against a future f lu outbreak. The incidence is also higher than average among parents who are familiar with ch ildhood immunizations and those with higher household incomes ($120,000+) and education. The incidence is slightly greater among those with a family doctor. Doubts that the H1N1 vaccine itself is safe are mos t prevalent among those with no family doctor and those who are not familiar with childhoo d immunizations relative to their counterparts. Parents of older children (15+), and therefore olde r parents (45 and over), are more likely than other parents to be concerned about the potential s ide effects of the vaccine, as are parents in Ontario. Those in British Columbia are more apt than average to say their children do not need the vaccine. Parents in Saskatchewan and Manitoba are more likel y than others to be concerned that there is not enough testing being done on vaccines genera lly or on a potential vaccine. Parents in Ontario were slightly more likely to say they lack information and that they are concerned about the side effects. EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2011 17 Parents were next asked whether they would receive an influenza vaccine themselves in the event of a global outbreak. Fifty-six per cent say t hey would choose to receive it, while 40 per cent s ay they would not receive it. About six in ten parents who are generally more in favour of vaccines (i.e., see them as important, safe and effective) say that they would get the vaccine (60 to 67 per cent). Barriers again relate to a perceived lack of need and concerns about safety, one in four (24 per cent) believes the vaccine is unnecessary ( e.g., one's immune system will take care of itself) . One in ten feels that the risks do not warrant receiving t he vaccine (10 per cent) or feels that vaccines in general are not safe (nine per cent). Seven per cent are co ncerned about side effects. One in twenty parents ( six per cent) bases their decision on their belief that vaccines are not effective, and similar proportion s feel there isn't enough information, or because there is n't enough testing (four to five per cent). Four per cent of parents attribute their decision to mistrust of inf ormation and slightly fewer (three per cent) feel t hey are not in a high risk group. One in five (21 per cent) men tioned reasons other than the top reasons mentioned by this group (each one cited by two per cent or fewer ), including: Got sick the last time the flu vaccine was administ ered; Don't think the H1N1 vaccine will be effective; Don't think the H1N1 vaccine will be safe; Never find the time; Confused by all the information about vaccines; Have had a negative reaction to the flu vaccine in the past; Aware that not all strains of the flu are covered; Fear of needles; Not around those at risk; There are other prevention methods, such as alternat ive medicine. 18 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2011 Vaccine Safety Survey, 2011 EKOS Intent and Rationale: Parent \"Would you choose to receive the vaccine yourself?\" Healthy, risks do not warrant it Vaccines are not effective Concerned about side effects Vaccines are not safe Unnecessary DK/NR Other[IF NO] \"Why not?\" Not enough information Flu not worth getting a vaccine n=1737 n=685 Not enough testing Propaganda, mistrust of motives Not in high risk group Intent to receive the vaccine for a future flu outb reak is considerably higher in Atlantic Canada and among upper socioeconomic households (e.g., inc omes of $120,000 or more and parents with graduate degrees), as well as among older pare nts (45+), relative to the national average. The predisposition is also somewhat higher among tho se with a family doctor (compared to families without). The intent to receive the vaccine is lowest in Briti sh Columbia relative to the national average, and lower among lower income parents and those with out a family doctor, relative to other parents. Among the 24 per cent of parents saying they are un likely to get the vaccine because they feel it is unnecessary, parents with kids between the ag es of 10 and 14 stand out as being more likely than other parents to say this. The nine per cent who believe that vaccines in gener al are not safe are typically in the lowest socioeconomic cohorts (i.e., lowest income and educ ation) and often have no family doctor, relative to other parents. EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2011 19 3.6 2010 INCIDENCE OF H1N1 IMMUNIZATION Fully 60 per cent of parents reported that someone in their household had received the H1N1 vaccine. Of the households with at least one H1N1 v accine recipient, 83 per cent say their child recei ved the vaccine, 77 per cent say they received the vaccine themselves, and 66 per cent reported that their spo use or other partner was vaccinated.

The reported incidence is lowest in British Columbia and Ontario. Incidence is also lowest with parents in lower socioeconomic strata (i.e., lowest education and income brackets), among immigrant parents (i.e., not born in Canada, whose first language is neither English nor French). 20 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2011 3.7 BARRIERS TO DECISION -MAKING The majority of Canadian parents did not report any obstacles when making decisions about immunizing their child, according to survey results . In fact, when asked whether they encountered contradictory information, lack of information, lac k of access to a nurse, or prohibitive costs of vac cines, just over half (54 per cent) said they had not encounter ed any of the difficulties presented to them. Howev er, one-third of respondents (34 per cent) said they en countered issues with contradictory information reg arding the safety of the vaccines. Thirteen per cent said t hey lacked information in general and eight per cen t did not have access to a nurse, clinic, or doctor to ad minister the vaccine. A further five per cent saw c ost of the vaccine as an impediment. Six in ten of the small segment of parents that re ported that their children are not up to date with their vaccines said that contradictory informa tion has been a barrier for them. Higher than avera ge proportions of parents who are generally not positi ve about vaccines (i.e., rating them as not very im portant, unsafe and ineffective) reported contradictory info rmation and a lack of information as problems. Vaccine Safety Survey, 2011 EKOS Research of the following been a problem or obstacl e for you when making decisions about immunizing your child?\" Contradictory information Lack of access to a nurse Cost of the vaccination DK/NR No problem/none of these Lack of information n=1745 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2011 21 Parents who are much more likely than average to sa y contradictory information about vaccines has been a barrier to decision making incl ude those who are relatively unfamiliar with childhood immunization, Francophones, and parents wi th young children (under 5), as well as those reporting previous side effects from immuniza tion, relative to their counterparts. Those with a university education are also somewhat more likely than those with less education to have encountered contradictory information. Those who have encountered a lack of information abo ut immunization are less like than average to have a family doctor. Quebecers (and therefore Francophones), as well as t hose without a family doctor are more likely than other parents to have reported barriers that have prevented them from accessing a health care worker to get an immunization. 3.8 INFORMATION AS A BARRIER TO DECISION -MAKING Parents who said that contradictory information se rved as a barrier to making decisions about immunizing their children were asked to rate the se riousness of this problem. Twenty-eight per cent see this as a serious problem, while most (66 per cent) see this as a moderate problem (i.e., 3, 4, or 5 on a 7 -point scale). Parents who pointed to a general lack of informati on as a barrier to decision-making about immunizing their children were asked to elaborate o n the types of missing information from a list prov ided. The majority of these respondents (72 per cent) said they were missing information on the risks of seri ous reactions to the vaccine. Two-thirds said they were missing information regarding the more common side effects of the vaccine (66 per cent). Information a bout the effectiveness of the vaccine was deemed mi ssing by 63 per cent while 49 per cent indicated concern over the lack of information available about the di seases that the vaccines prevent. 22 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2011 Vaccine Safety Survey, 2011 EKOS Research Associates Inc.

Also, parents with no family doctor were more likel y than those with a doctor to have found this to have been a great problem for them. Anglophone parents were more likely to cite a lack of information about the potential risk of a severe reaction. EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2011 23 4. INFORMATION ABOUT IMMUNIZATION The majority of parents follow the advice of their child's doctor or nurse (89 per cent), according to survey results. Moreover, more than th ree-quarters (78 per cent) agree that health provid ers clearly explain the risks and benefits of vaccines. In terms of the Internet, more than six in ten par ents (62 per cent) believe there is a lot of misinformat ion about vaccines on the Internet. Just over half of parents (54 per cent) feel that the Internet is giving pare nts access to good information to make decisions, w hile the remainder appear to be less convinced of this. Pointing more specifically to a gap in information or understanding, one in five parents agrees with the statement that they often feel confused ab out the number and scheduling of vaccines (21 per c ent) and just slightly fewer agree that they do not unde rstand how vaccines work (17 per cent).

It is also more prevalent among those whose first languag e is neither English nor French. Parents who have reported that their children are not up to date with their vaccines are also more apt to have reported confusion compared with other pare nts. Parents more likely to express confidence in their knowledge of how vaccines work and of the scheduling/timing of immunizations are in the highe st income and education categories, are more likely to be Anglophones and, not surprisingly , are significantly more likely to consider themselves to be very familiar with childhood immun izations, relative to the national average. Albertans are less likely than others across the co untry to say they do not know how vaccines work. Parents who have attained high education levels and whose household income is in the higher ranges are more likely than parents with less educa tion and income to disagree with the belief that parents are provided good access to informatio n about immunization through the Internet, and to agree with the statement that there is a lot of misinformation on the Internet. Scepticism about the reliability of information on the Interne t is also more common among Anglophones, residents of British Columbia, and parents of young children (under 5 years), compared with other parents. Those who believe that the Internet is providing acc ess to good information are more likely to have immigrated to Canada, speak neither English no r French as their first language or live in Ontario, compared with the national average. Those w ith less than a college education are less likely to believe that the Internet provides m isinformation, as are parents who have children age ten and older (compared to those with younger children). Not surprisingly, those who are without a family do ctor are less likely than those with a doctor to say that the risks and benefits of immunization have been clearly explained to them by their child's health provider. Those parents reporting th at their children are not up to date with their vaccines are also much less likely to agree with th is statement. On the other hand, parents who have a family doctor, who consider themselves f amiliar with childhood immunizations, and who have young children (under 5 years) are more li kely than other parents to feel that their child's health provider clearly explained the risks and benefits of immunization to them. Following the advice of one's doctor or nurse is, no t surprisingly, more common among those who have a family doctor. It is much less common (6 2 per cent) among parents who have reported that their children are not up to date wit h their vaccines than among those who reported that their children are up to date (92 per cent). EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2011 25 4.1 SEARCHING FOR INFORMATION ABOUT IMMUNIZATION Two-thirds of respondents (67 per cent) have search ed for information regarding vaccines for their children, according to survey results. Parents rely most on two sources: the Internet (us ed by 63 per cent of parents) and physicians (54 per cent). One in five parents who have looked for information (21 per cent) said they sought it f rom a health care worker other than a physician. Four per cent of the national average of parents have consul ted a CLSC but this is actually 16 per cent of parents in Quebec (where CLSCs are available) making it comparable to other health care providers in other parts of the country. Thirteen per cent consulted a friend or family member and seven per cent obtained inform ation from their local health authority. Four per ce nt each referenced books and three per cent had looked at pamphlets. Other types of information were cite d by less than three per cent, including: Pharmacists; Schools; Health clinics, doctors' offices; papers (e.g., scientific, professional jou rnal publications). Vaccine Safety Survey, 2011 vaccines?\"Search for Information about Immunization [IF YES] \"Where did you look or who did you talk to?\" n=1161 Books Other*CLSC Internet Physician Local public health authority Family member/friend n=1745 Other health care worker1% 67% 32% Yes No Don't recallPamphlets * % of Quebec parents 26 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2011 Those in the highest income bracket ($120,000+) are more likely than other parents to have sought out information on vaccines, as are parents with a university degree. Not surprisingly, those who describe themselves as being familiar wit h childhood immunization are also more likely to have looked for information on their own (through means such as the Internet) as are parents with a child who has had an adverse reactio n to a medication, relative to other parents. There are also some regional and linguistic differen ces in seeking out information. Quebec parents are less likely to have looked for informat ion (on their own) than parents in other provinces. As a result, the incidence is also lower among Francophone parents relative to other parents. The incidence of looking for informat ion is highest among Albertans. Ontarians are more likely than other parents across the country to be getting this information directly from their physicians and, similarly, thos e in British Columbia and Alberta are most apt to get this information from other health care prov iders. This is in notable contrast to parents in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, who use friends or famil y members as resources more often than parents in other provinces. Residents of Quebec seem to be less likely than oth er Canadian parents to use the Internet to find this information. This is driven, in part, by their greater propensity to be informed by CLSC's physicians. Parents in the territories are considerably more ap t to have consulted with a health care provider other than a physician (e.g., another heal th care worker or local public health authority). Younger parents (under 35) are slightly less likely than older parents to say they have sought information about immunization; and when they do, i t is more often from books (e.g., medical, parenting). It is the 35-39 parent age cohort that is most likely to be searching for information about immunization on the Internet. Use of the Internet as a resource for information o n vaccines is related to income levels, with the wealthiest ($120,000+) being more likely to use this tool than less affluent parents. Parents with younger children (under 5) are more li kely than those with older children to get this information from books, the Internet, or healt h care providers other than physicians. EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2011 27 4.2 SOURCES OF INFORMATION Parents who used the Internet to search for inform ation related to vaccines were asked, unprompted, to identify the website that they used. The predominant response, cited by half of these respondents (49 per cent) was the search engine Goo gle (not specifying the actual website). Various government websites, including Health Canada (13 pe r cent) and provincial (seven per cent) or Governme nt of Canada websites generally (six per cent) round o ut the top four website mentions. Parents' websites are a source of information for four per cent. Other so urces and websites cited by less than four per cent include: Mayo Clinic Web-MD Unspecified health/medical sites Wikis World Health Organization PubMed Canada Public Health Agency MedLine Doctissimo Regional/local authorities Online chatrooms/forums Medical journals and universities Reputable/reliable/knowledgeable sources Immunization sites (for and against) Other search engines/launchers (e.g. Canoe, Yahoo) General searches/various websites 28 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2011 Vaccine Safety Survey, 2011 EKOS \"Where on the Internet would y ou usually go?\" Google DK/NR Other online sources n=719 Health Canada Provincial government websites Government of Canada websites Parent's websites Parents in Alberta and Anglophones are slightly mor e likely than other parents to use Google as an Internet source for information on vaccines. Parents in Quebec and Francophones are less likely t han other parents to use Google. On the other hand, they look to Health Canada for informat ion more often than other parents do, as is also the case with older parents (ages 40-44) compa red with younger parents. Use of websites targeted to parents is most common for younger parents (under 35) relative to older parents. A preference for provincial government websites is much more pronounced among parents in the highest income category, as well as parents wit h a university degree (although the pattern is less pronounced), relative to provincial website use among other parents. EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2011 29 4.3 AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION FOR DECISION -MAKING Parents were asked whether they felt they had enou gh information to make informed decisions about their child's immunizations. Despite the find ing that 34 per cent of parents indicated contradic tory information and 13 per cent of parents indicated a lack of information as problems for them when makin g immunization decisions, fully 86 per cent of respon dents indicated that they felt they did in fact hav e enough information. This proportion is lower (73 per cent), however, among parents that reported that their ch ildren are not up to date with their latest immunization s chedule. Parents who do not feel that they have enough info rmation to make informed decisions when it comes to immunization are most often looking for in formation that will enable them to assess risk. Twen ty- four per cent of parents say they would like additi onal information regarding the risks and side effec ts associated with the use of vaccines and 25 per cent would like a summary of the risks associated with diseases and the vaccines that prevent them. Six pe r cent of parents would like information about how bad the disease and symptoms are. Eighteen per cent wou ld like more information about studies being done (e.g., long term effects of vaccines), which may be sought by parents looking to assess risk or to ass ess effectiveness. Other responses include a schedule o f when vaccines should be received (12 per cent), information regarding the benefits of the vaccine a nd its effectiveness (nine per cent), information a bout how the vaccine works (seven per cent), and information on accessing doctors or nurses (e.g., at open hous es, information lines) to get questions answered (six p er cent). Eleven per cent provided other responses (each cited by five per cent or less). These suggestions i nclude more pamphlets, brochures and handouts in general; information on risks of getting the diseas e; information about accessing and purchasing the vaccine; and more media coverage. 30 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2011 Vaccine Safety Survey, 2011 EKOS Decision-Making \"Thinking about all types of vaccines, do you feel you have enough information or resources available to make informed decisions for your child?\" How bad disease is/symptoms are Summary of what to get when Summary of risks of disease and vaccine Risks of side effects DK/NR Other n=1745 n=209 \"What information or resources would you to have available?\" 12% 86% 2% Yes No DK/NR Info on studies done More info in general Open/unbiased/truthful Benefits/how effective it is Access to doctors/nurses How it works General handout, flyer, pamphlet Parents who feel they are ill-prepared to make info rmed decisions regarding their child and immunization are more likely to come from a low inc ome household (less than $40,000), to have a mother tongue that is not English or French, to have been born outside Canada, to have no family doctor, and to be less familiar with childhood immunization relative to the national average of all parents. Parents in the highest income category are more lik ely than parents with less income to want more information on the possible side effects of va ccines, as well as information on the risks of disease and vaccines. Those who are familiar with v accines are also more likely to want information about side effects compared to other pa rents. Interest in information about research studies, cli nical trials and testing of vaccines is more prominent among university educated parents, relati ve to the interest levels of those with less education. Parents who would like more information about the b enefits of getting vaccinated are more often those with young children (under 5 years) com pared with parents with older children. They are also more likely to have a university educa tion. EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2011 31 4.4 RELIABILITY OF INFORMATION Respondents were asked, unprompted, where they wou ld look if they were searching for the most reliable and trustworthy information on vaccin es. Interestingly, despite the widespread use of th e Internet to search for vaccine information expresse d earlier, fewer respondents see it as the most rel iable and trustworthy source of information. Just one-qua rter (27 per cent) say they would use the Internet. A majority of parents (68 per cent) say they would co nsult a physician and another one in five would con sult another health care worker, such as a public health nurse (13 per cent), local public health authority (seven per cent), another health care worker (five per cent), or Health Canada (four per cent). Five pe r cent would consult a friend or family member and four pe r cent would rely on a CLSC. Two per cent identify t he Government of Canada (in general) as the most relia ble and trustworthy source of information top of mi nd. Ten per cent would look to other sources for reliabl e information (each mention cited by less than two per cent), including schools, alternative medicine, var ious provincial sources, Info Sant\u00e9, books, news me dia, telehealth lines, and impartial or unbiased sources generally. Parents who said they would look to the Internet f or the most reliable and trustworthy information on vaccines show a preference for the s earch engine Google (49 per cent) as a way of getti ng to useful information. Fifteen per cent would rely on the Health Canada site, and equal proportions would rely on Government of Canada websites or provincial sour ces generally (six per cent each). Seventeen per ce nt say they would trust some other online source (each cited by less than two per cent), including Passpo rt Sant\u00e9, Canadian Pediatric Association, Web MD, Cent re for Disease Control, various doctor sites (e.g., Dr. Oz, Dr. Sears), and independent/reliable/unbiased s ources.

The same is true of health care workers for residents of British Columbia. Res idents of Ontario are significantly more likely to feel that a physician is the best source of information. Not surprisingly, parents place their trust in the health care provider they know. Those parents with a family doctor are more likely to trust a phy sician to provide the most reliable information about vaccines than those who do not have a family doctor. Those without a family doctor place greater faith in their local public health au thority than those with a family doctor. CLSCs are the second most trusted source among Queb ecers and Francophones as a result of their accessibility in Quebec. Parents in the territories more often reported trus t in a public health nurse or local public health authority. Those who were born outside Canada are somewhat more likely to be trusting of physicians. Interestingly, this demographic group of parents, a s well as those who have children who were not born in Canada, are more likely than parents ov erall to trust the reliability of the information they get from the Internet. Among parents who said they would find trustworthy and reliable information on the Internet, those with a college education, more modest incomes (between $40,000-$69,000) and whose first language is neither English nor French are mor e likely to say that Google is where they would usually go for this information. The Health Canada website is more likely to be cited as a trustworthy website by parents with middle incomes (i.e., $70,000-$99,000) and by paren ts with graduate degrees. 4.5 DISCUSSIONS WITH HEALTH PROFESSIONALS Discussions with a health professional about conce rns regarding immunization are quite common, according to survey results. Fully half (49 per cent) of all parents indicated having had such a conversation. This is considerably higher among pare nts that reported their children are not up to date with their vaccines (63 per cent). The vaccine that parents have asked about varies co nsiderably; however, one in seven (15 per cent) raised concerns about the HPV vaccine (the top concern). One in ten parents said they discussed vaccines in general (13 per cent), the ch icken pox vaccine (12 per cent), and the H1N1 vacci ne (10 per cent). Both the flu and the H1N1 vaccines together were brought up by seve n per cent, as was the flu vaccine on its own. Less frequent mentions incl uded the MMR vaccine (six per cent), the vaccine to prevent Hepatitis B (five per cent), the vaccine to prevent meningococcal disease (four per cent), ear ly childhood vaccinations (four per cent) and the poli o and tetanus vaccine (two per cent). Four per cent EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2011 33 discussed some other vaccine (less than two per cen t citing each), including the pneumococcal vaccine, the \"whooping cough\" vaccine, and specific concerns abo ut autism. Vaccine Safety Survey, 2011 EKOS Professionals \"Have you ever had a discussion with a health professional that involved a particular concern that you had about immunizing your child?\"Vaccines in general Chicken pox vaccine HPV DK/NR Other specific vaccine n=1745 n=856 \"Which No H1N1 vaccine Flu/H1N1 vaccine MMR Flu vaccine Hepatitis B Polio, tetanus Meningococcal disease Early childhood vaccinations The likelihood of having had a discussion with a hea lth professional in regard to their child's immunization is more pronounced among parents in Qu ebec than among other parents across the country. Older parents and those who consider t hemselves to be familiar with childhood immunization are also more likely to have had a dis cussion with a health professional, relative to other parents. This likelihood is also more commo n among more educated and affluent parents, as well as those with young children (unde r 5 years), compared with their counterparts. Those who were not born in Canada are less likely to have had this kind of discussion than other parents, as are parents in Ontario. Those who have had a conversation about vaccines in general with their health professional are more likely to have young children (under 5 yea rs) and to be generally familiar with childhood immunizations compared to other parents. The chicken pox vaccine is more likely to be of concern to young parents (under 35) and, to a lesser extent, parents with a child between the ages of 5 and 9 than other parents. The H1N1 vaccine is also more likely to have been discussed by parents who have children between the ages of 5 and 9, in addition to those who live in Quebec and Atlantic Canada than i t is among other parents. The HPV vaccine is of greater interest to older parents wit h children in their teens. 34 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2011 4.6 CONCERNS RAISED WITH HEALTH PROFESSIONALS Among parents who raised concerns about a childhoo d vaccine with a health professional, one-third (32 per cent) indicated concerns about po tential side effects and a further 15 per cent ques tioned the necessity of getting the vaccine. Eight per cen t asked about the benefits/effectiveness of the vac cine and the same proportion raised concerns other than safety (e.g., access to a doctor or clinic). Twelve per cent had some other concern that they brought up wi th their doctor (with two per cent or less citing e ach), including: That a vaccine might cause the disease it is meant t o prevent; The ingredients/potency of the vaccine; Links to allergies; Concerns about the vaccine weakening the immune sys tem; Concerns about the child's underlying health issues ; Mercury in vaccines; Concern that the immune system is unable to handle immunizations; and Concern that too many immunizations are required. Another eight per cent said they had no particular concern - they were just discussing the risks and options in general.

Questions regarding the necessity of vaccines were more prevalent among those who are not familiar with childhood immunization. Parents with questions about the effectiveness of a vaccine are more concentrated in Quebec than elsewhere in the country. The concern over a possible connection between vacci nes and autism is more likely to have been raised by parents in Alberta than parents in o ther provinces. In terms of reaction from the health care provider , in 23 per cent of cases the parent was advised to obtain the immunization, indicating that the benefits outweighed the risk. In 16 per cent o f cases the health care provider and parent discussed the p ros and cons, and explained the ingredients. In 13 per cent of cases the health care providers assured the parent that the vaccine is safe and represents a m inimal risk to children. In eight per cent of cases, the p arent reported that the health care provider was ge nerally supportive and re-assuring. In seven per cent of ca ses parents were provided with some additional fact ual information to consider. 4.7 OUTCOME OF DISCUSSIONS WITH HEALTH PROFESSIONALS More than two-thirds of those with concerns (68 pe r cent) ultimately had their child immunized. Approximately one-quarter (23 per cent), however, d id not receive the vaccine and two per cent were st ill deciding. In a small number of cases (two per cent) , some vaccines were received while others were not , or not all dosages of the same vaccine were received. 36 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2011 Vaccine Safety Survey, 2011 EKOS Research Associates Inc. Outcome of Discussion with receivevaccine Still deciding No answer[HAD A DISCUSSION WITH A HEALTH PROFESSIONAL] \"What was your final decision on this issue?\" Other n=856 Receive some vaccines and not others Those who ultimately decided to have their child rec eive the vaccine are more likely to be from Alberta or Atlantic Canada than elsewhere in the co untry. They are also more likely to have a young child (under 5), compared to parents with old er children. Those who decided against having the vaccine for the ir child are more likely to be from Ontario than elsewhere in Canada. The incidence is also high er in households with an older child (15 or over). EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2011 37 5. PERCEPTIONS REGARDING IMMUNIZATION 5.1 PERCEIVED RELATIVE SAFETY OF DIFFERENT HEALTH PRODUCTS In order to gauge perceptions of the safety of vac cines, parents were presented with a list of health products available in Canada and asked to ra te the relative safety of each one. Childhood vacci nes garnered the most confidence, with 65 per cent rati ng them as highly safe (i.e., 6 or 7 on a 7-point s cale). By comparison, parents are more cautious when it comes to prescription drugs and over the counter medicin es, with 52 per cent and 40 per cent, respectively, rat ing these products as highly safe. Parents appear considerably more concerned with the safety of natu ral health products, with just 25 per cent rating t hem as highly safe. Very few parents rated vaccines (or pr escription drugs or over the counter medicines) as unsafe. Vaccine Safety Survey, 2011 EKOS Research Associates Inc. Perceived Relative Safety of Different Health Produ cts 9444 59 55 42 30 25 52 65 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% safe (6-7)Childhood vaccinations \"From what you believe to be the case in terms of s afety standards, testing and approval, how safe are each of the foll owing in Canada?\" Prescription drugs Over the counter medicines Natural health products n=1745 38 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2011 Parents that have not had their children fully immu nized according the age appropriate schedule perceive over the counter medications, pre scription drugs, and vaccines to be less safe than other parents do. Residents of Atlantic Canada demonstrate a greater likelihood than others across the country of being confident in the safety of vaccines, as we ll as prescription drugs and over the counter medications. Ontarians are also slightly more likel y to be confident in the safety of vaccines. Parents in the territories are less apt than other parents to rate both over the counter medicines and childhood vaccinations as safe (altho ugh in the case of childhood vaccines 48 per cent do rate them as highly safe). Familiarity with childhood immunizations appears to be associated with parents feeling more confident than others in the safety of vaccines. Pa rents who have a family doctor are also somewhat more likely to feel that vaccines are safe compared with the safety level accorded by those without a family doctor. Older parents (45 and older) are typically more con fident in the safety of vaccines than younger parents. Concerns about safety are significantly outweighed by the prevalence of positive attitudes regarding the importance and effectiveness of vacci nes throughout the survey. That said, in response to other lines of inquiry, some safety concerns have b een expressed. In particular, half of parents (51 p er cent) are concerned that new vaccines are not as safe as older vaccines. Four in ten parents are more concer ned about the safety of vaccines now than five years ag o (43 per cent) and a similar proportion agrees tha t adverse reactions to vaccines don't get enough atte ntion in the media (40 per cent). A third of parent s feels that children today receive too many vaccines (31 p er cent). To a much smaller extent, 16 per cent of parents ag reed with the statement that vaccines are not safe, and a similar proportion agreed that the use of alternative practices can eliminate the need for vaccines (14 per cent). EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2011 39 Vaccine Safety Survey, 2011 EKOS Research Associates Inc.

The belief that vaccines are not safe is most preval ent among parents who were not born in Canada and those with the lowest household incomes (under $40,000). Parents who share this belief are also somewhat more likely to lack a family doctor and to have had some or all of their children born outside of Canada, relative to the incidence among other parent segments. Concern over the safety of newer vaccines in compar ison to older ones is particularly prevalent among residents of Quebec and Francophones compared with other parents across the country. Parents who also share this concern ar e less likely to have a family doctor and more likely to have modest household incomes ($40,0 00-69,000). They are also more likely to be younger (under 35 years old) relative to the nat ional average. The belief that adverse reactions to vaccines do not receive enough attention in the media these days is more prevalent in the lowest income b racket, among younger parents (under 35) and those who have no family doctor than in other p arent segments; this is also the case with parents who are less familiar with immunizations. Those expressing greater concern over the safety of vaccines than they did five years ago are significantly more likely to be the parents of youn g children (under 5 years) compared with those with older children. They are also less likely to have a family doctor, and more often are parents for whom neither English nor French are thei r first language. The concentration of this 40 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2011 concern is also higher among those with mid to lowe r income, as well as among younger parents (under 35) compared with other parents. Support for the claim that alternative practices ma y eliminate the need for vaccines is most prevalent among parents who were born outside Canad a. Similarly, parents born outside Canada are much more likely to feel that children t oday receive too many vaccines. While Quebec residents are more likely than others to agree that children receive too many vaccines these days, they are less likely to believ e that alternative methods may eliminate the need for so many vaccines. EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2011 41 6. ADVERSE REACTIONS AND MONITORING 6.1 INCIDENCE OF REPORTED ADVERSE REACTIONS Parents were asked if their child had ever experie nced a side effect or reaction to a medication that required a visit to a doctor or hospital. Four teen per cent reported that they sought medical att ention for their child as a result of a reaction to medication . That said, only one-third of these cases (32 per c ent) was related to a vaccine (n=74). Parents who reported t hat their children are not up to date with their va ccines are no more likely than other parents to have repor ted a side effect experienced by a child. Vaccine Safety Survey, 2011 EKOS Research Associates Inc. Incidence of Reported Adverse Reactions your child ever experienced a side effect or reaction to a medication that required a visit to the doctor or hospital?\"[IF YES] \"Was this a side effect or reaction to a vaccine?\" There are few significant or meaningful differences in sample segments for these results. 42 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2011 6.2 NATURE AND REPORTING OF ADVERSE REACTIONS The small number of respondents whose child had exp erienced a side effect or reaction to a vaccine (n=74) were asked to describe the side effe cts that their child experienced. Keeping in mind t hat the numbers are small, just under half of these parents said their child felt ill or tired on the day of i njection, while one in four reported that their child experie nced hives or swelling. A small proportion said the ir child experienced mumps, rash or itching and a similar pr oportion said their child experienced redness aroun d the area of the injection. A few said their child becam e ill in the days following the administration of t he vaccine. General illness in the following days, diarrhea and vomiting, seizures, and the flu were also mentione d by a few respondents. Table 6.1: Nature of Adverse Reactions Side effect or reaction to a vaccine* Number of Res pondents Felt ill or tired, fever on day of injection 35 Hives, swelling 20 Mumps/rash/itching 9 Redness at the injection 8 Became ill in following days 4 Seizures 4 Vomiting/diarrhea 4 Got the flu 4 Shortness of breath 2 Eye irritation 2 Other 3 n=74 *Multiple answers were permitted Most of these parents said that they reported the incident. Just over half said they reported the side effect or reaction to the doctor or clinic tha t administered the vaccine. Another small proportio n reported it to a different doctor (who did not deliver the v accine). Some also reported the reaction to a local public health authority or to a hospital. Results suggest that parents experienced relativel y few problems in reporting these reactions. Of those respondents that had reported their child' s reaction, 83 per cent experienced no problems at all, although ten per cent said they had experienced dif ficulties. EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2011 43 Table 6.2: Details on Reporting of Adverse Reactions Person/Authority Reported To* Number of Respondents Doctor/clinic that administered vaccine 40 Different doctor 8 Local public health authority 8 Hospital 6 Pharmacist 1 Other 2 DK/NR 2 n=66 *Multiple answers were permitted In many cases the reaction from the health care pr oviders was to advise the parent to continue to proceed with the immunization for their child. I n some cases the immunization was provided in the s ame consultation. In a few cases, parents were told tha t this kind of reaction is possible and in another few cases parents were told to monitor the situation and repo rt any worsening of the problem. In a small number of cases the immunization protocol was terminated. A h andful of parents also reported no particular react ion form their health care provider. 6.3 AWARENESS OF MONITORING FOR ADVERSE REACTIONS Just over half of parents (57 per cent) indicated that they believe that adverse reactions are tracked in Canada. Respondents offered a range of e xplanations regarding how adverse reactions are tracked, though the largest proportion (30 per cent ) believes doctors and clinic staff report these re actions to public health authorities. One in five (21 per cent ) believes that doctors and clinic staff keep their own records. Nine per cent believe that doctors and cli nic staff report directly to the federal government and three per cent say that doctors and clinic staff re port the reactions to the drug manufacturers. Eight per cent (two per cent or less in each case) suggested that adverse reactions are tracked through some other method including health care databases, registries, records and systems; general reporting to Health Canada; and health professionals reporting the info rmation generally. Parents who reported that their children are not u p to date with their vaccines are less likely to believe that side effects are tracked compared with those parents whose children are up to date. 44 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2011 Vaccine Safety Survey, 2011 EKOS Research Associates Inc.

Those much more likely to doubt the existence of a tracking sy stem are parents in Quebec, Francophones, and those who are not familiar with childhood immun ization, relative to others. Residents of Ontario and those with some children who were born outside of Canada are also somewhat less likely to believe that tracking takes place. The perception that doctors must report adverse reac tions to a public health authority is more commonly held in Manitoba and Saskatchewan than els ewhere in Canada. This is also true of parents with a university education, and those in t he highest income bracket relative to those with less education and lower income. The perception that doctors and clinics keep their o wn records is more prevalent among the youngest cohort of parents (under 35) than it is am ong older parents. Those less likely to believe that doctors and clinic s report adverse reactions to the federal government are parents in the lowest income and edu cation categories and younger parents (under 35). EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2011 45 6.4 CONFIDENCE IN TRACKING SYSTEM Thirty-six per cent of parents indicate a high degr ee of confidence in the system for tracking these side effects, rating themselves with a six or seven on a seven point scale. Six in ten (59 per c ent) say they are moderately confident. Very few (five per c ent) describe themselves as not confident in the sy stem. Vaccine Safety Survey, 2011 EKOS Research Associates Inc.

Higher income parents ($120,000+) are also somewhat more likely to express high confidence than those with less income.
