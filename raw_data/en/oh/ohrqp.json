Centre for Health Protection controller Dr Thomas Tsang Ho-fai said more statistics and information would be needed before a final decision could be made - possibly as early as this week. Tsang was speaking after a meeting of the centre's scientific committee yesterday afternoon. The committee discussed whether free shots should be extended to primary school pupils - going beyond the present provision for children aged between six months and six years. More than 80 per cent of primary schools reported swine flu outbreaks last September and October, he said. A university study has shown that many pupils have developed natural antibodies from those outbreaks. The vaccination rate levelled off at above 6 per cent last week following reports that the shots may be connected to Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare side effect that can damage the nervous system. Tsang acknowledged that the number of people receiving injections last week was 'not too high', dropping from a peak of about 10,000 a day to the current 2,000. As of 1pm yesterday, the total vaccination rate stood at 6.69 per cent of people in high-risk groups, after 2,765 were inoculated over the weekend. A 58-year-old doctor was confirmed as having Guillain-Barre syndrome last week, although it remained unclear whether the vaccine caused it. A 91-year-old man, who reported weakness in his legs five days after receiving the injection, was cleared of the syndrome. The case of a 66-year-old woman, who died at home on Sunday after having a shot on Christmas Eve, was not related to the vaccine, Tsang said. He repeated calls for people in high-risk groups to receive the injections. 'Since the vaccination programme began on December 21, we have had 30 severe cases of swine flu and six deaths,' he said. 'That is much more than the number of side effects reported.' The government ordered three million doses of vaccine from Sanofi-Aventis. Half a million arrived last month, and the rest are expected to arrive in one large shipment this month. Hong Kong Doctors Union president Henry Yeung Chiu-fat said many private doctors wanted to return unused vaccine to the government as the number of people getting vaccinated at private clinics has dropped almost 90 per cent. Meanwhile, a 52-year-old man with end-stage kidney failure, high blood pressure and diabetes became the city's 58th death from swine flu yesterday. He was admitted to hospital on December 17 and confirmed to have swine flu two days later. "}
