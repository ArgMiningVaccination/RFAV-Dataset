How can the British government, itself drowning in deception at every level, dare accuse anyone of fraud? The panel assembled by the government and academia to judge Wakefield, ironically, dares to speak of fraud, yet their main complaint is that his findings \"might endanger the 'sacrosanct' vaccine program,\" not that his principal findings were wrong. In fact, several independent researchers found the same measles vaccine-related colitis that he described. A recently released charge by the British Medical Journal editors is that Wakefield was poised to get huge profits from a product stemming from his research results. I am not here to defend Wakefield, rather, I demonstrate the double standard regularly practiced by his vocal critics. Virtually every paper published on drugs, such as statins, is authored by individuals having financial links to as many as three to four pharmaceutical companies each. The same is true of papers published by major journals extolling vaccine efficacy and safety. They know these papers violate every ethical principle known, yet they are published in some of the most prestigious journals. Abundant evidence has shown that these very same people destroy the reputations of anyone producing evidence, no matter how well researched and of the highest ethical standards, if it in any way endangers this vaccine program. It is ironic that these accusers speak of \"blatant fraud,\" when virtually all of the vaccine safety evidence they use abundantly is fraudulent by careful design. Ironically, even their outcry of the effect of Wakefield's paper is deceitful. They scream that it caused vaccine rates to fall below the 80 percent level needed for \"herd immunity,\" when they know that no one has ever proven his paper was the cause. A growing number of British have suffered from vaccine complications, and they are rightly concerned about vaccine safety. When there was a small outbreak of measles in this country, as few as 300 cases, they screamed it was an epidemic and millions were at risk of dying. In fact, in similar outbreaks studies found that 90 percent of the affected children had been fully or partially vaccinated, and most had mild infections. When I grew up there was no measles vaccine and everyone in my class got the measles and no one died or suffered serious harm. To imply our society is at risk of millions of deaths should vaccine rates drop is a blatant lie used to scare parents into over-vaccinating their children. They use the same scare tactics based on manipulated data to terrify the elderly into getting a flu shot every year.
