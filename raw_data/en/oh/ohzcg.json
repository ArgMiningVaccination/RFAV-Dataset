Early clinical successes from cancer immunotherapy have led to a growing list of FDA approvals, and many new therapies are in clinical andpreclinical development. Nucleic acid therapeutics, including DNA, mRNA, and genome editing systems, hold signicant potential as a form of immunotherapy due to its robust use in cancer vaccination, adoptive T-cell therapy, and gene regulation. However, these therapeutics must overcome numerous delivery obstacles to be successful, including rapid in vivo degradation, poor uptake into target cells, required nuclear entry, and po- tential in vivo toxicity in healthy cells and tissues. Nanoparticle delivery systems have been engineered to overcome several of these barriers as a means to safely and e ectively deliver nucleic acid therapeutics to immune cells. In this Review, we discuss the applications of nucleic acid therapeutics in cancer immunotherapy,and we detail how nanoparticle platforms have been designed to deliver mRNA, DNA, and genome editing systems to enhance the potency and safety of these therapeutics. 1. Introduction Despite advances in understanding the underlying mechanisms of cancer progression, chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery remain the current standards-of-care for many cancers [ 1]. The use of these stra- tegies has become more focused and personalized based on the type andstage of disease, which has led to a decline in cancer-related mortality over the past three decades [ 2]. However, these therapies are often highly invasive, have substantial adverse side e ects, and therapeutic results are variable [ 3-5]. Thus, there is a dire need to develop non- invasive, minimally toxic, and highly speci c alternatives. Towards this goal, cancer immunotherapy has emerged as a powerful alternative to conventional therapies, and substantial research e orts are ongoing to improve upon their e cacy and safety. The overarching goal of cancer immunotherapy is to introduce the necessary molecular tools to harness the immune system to halt disease progression. Thus, immunotherapy can be personalized for speci c types and stages of cancer, with higher safety pro les and longer therapeutic windows compared to traditional cancer therapeutics [ 6]. Theeld encompasses several classes of immunotherapy, including gene therapy, cellular vaccines, checkpoint inhibitors, agonistic anti- bodies, and cytokines [ 7]. Of these, checkpoint inhibitors and cytokinesare the most widely studied to date, and multiple therapies are cur- rently used in the clinic [ 7]. More recently, nucleic acid therapeutics including DNA, mRNA, and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing systems haveemerged as an important branch of cancer immunotherapy. The vast potential of nucleic acids for treating cancer can be demonstrated by the use of CRISPR/Cas9 to inactivate PD-1/PD-L1 interactions between cancer cells and T-cells [ 8]. In one example of this, CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing was used to generate PD-1 de cient anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells, resulting in enhanced killing of PD-L1+ tumor xenografts [ 8]. Similarly, gene therapy approaches are highly prevalent in adoptive T-cell immunotherapy to induce T-cells to expressCARs. In 2017, Novartis gained the rst FDA approval for a cell-based gene therapy, Kymriah, which utilizes CAR T-cells to treat leukemia[9,10]. The early success of Kymriah and the ability for CRISPR/Cas9 to enhance T-cell-mediated killing form the basis for the development ofother types of gene therapy to treat cancer, with reduced adverse e ects and higher success rates than traditional approaches [ 9,10]. Although the examples described above demonstrate the ther- apeutic potential of nucleic acid therapeutics, their translation into the clinic is hindered by several delivery challenges for both ex vivo and in vivoapplications. Nucleic acids are highly unstable, and they degrade quickly in the presence of nucleases before reaching the desired tissues https://doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2019.04.040 Received 3 February 2019; Received in revised form 17 April 2019; Accepted 30 April 2019Corresponding author.

Further, nucleic acids are unable to enter cells alone, requiring the use of transfection reagents or physical techniques (such as electro- poration) that are highly toxic to cells ex vivo and are not feasible for in vivouse [ 12,13]. Several nucleic acid therapeutics, such as gene editing components and DNA, are faced with another delivery barrier of crossing the nuclear membrane to be transcribed in the nucleus [ 14]. Thus, there is great interest in developing novel delivery platforms thatcan encapsulate and protect nucleic acids, as well as mediate their delivery into the desired tissues and cells, in order to exploit their powerful therapeutic potential. Nanoparticles (NPs), which are typically de ned as particles that are 1- 1000 nm in diameter, are being developed to overcome the de- livery barriers faced by nucleic acids (Fig. 1). NPs can be comprised of arange of materials such as lipids, polymers, or metals, all of which o er unique delivery advantages that have been thoroughly reviewed else-where [ 11,15,16]. Importantly, NP features such as material composi- tion, size, and surface chemistry can be carefully engineered for nucleicacid delivery. NPs can encapsulate or bind to nucleic acid therapeutics via electrostatic interactions or chemical conjugation to overcome the therapeutic challenges faced by unbound nucleic acids [ 6,7]. Ad- ditionally NPs can reduce therapeutic toxicity, by promoting site-spe-cic accumulation and reducing o -target e ects. Further, NPs o er protection over the therapeutic cargo, to avoid nuclease degradationand to extend circulation half-life. In addition to protecting nucleic acids, NPs can be engineered to respond to environmental cues, such as the acidic environment within solid tumors or within the endosomes of cells, to degrade and release therapeutic cargo on-demand [ 17]. By enabling control over nucleic acid delivery, NPs can minimize toxicityin healthy tissues while maximizing delivery to cancer cells, which may be highly bene cial for solid tumor immunotherapy [ 18]. Lastly, NPs can be modi ed with targeting ligands and other molecules, to promote both cellular and nuclear uptake to targeted tissues that overexpress the targeted protein [ 19]. Here, we review the design of NP platforms for nucleic acid delivery - including mRNA, DNA, and genome editing therapies -and their applications in cancer immunotherapy. Several NP platforms have de- monstrated preclinical success in delivering nucleic acids to target cells, and signi cant eorts are now underway to translate these technologies into the clinic. Of note, lipid NPs (LNPs) complexed with mRNA arecurrently being evaluated of melanoma (NCT02410733) [ 20]. Further, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals received the rst FDA approval of an RNA therapeutic for their lipid-siRNA NP, Onpattro, in 2018 [ 7,21]. Below, we overview applications of NPs for delivering DNA, mRNA, and genome editing systems for cancer im- munotherapy, and we discuss future directions of gene therapy towards the goal of clinical translation. 2. Nanoparticles for DNA delivery DNA vaccine-based cancer immunotherapy, in which cells are transfected with plasmid or chemically synthesized DNA to elicit im- mune responses against the encoded antigen, is a powerful tool to en- gage the immune system to attack cancer cells [ 22]. Early studies in mice demonstrated the ability of DNA plasmids to drive immune re-sponses against transgene uenza, human im- munode ciency virus-1, and cancer, which established DNA as a pro- mising immunization platform [ 23]. However, initial clinical applications of DNA vaccines revealed only low levels of immunity,indicating that naked DNA was not feasible as an independent vacci- nation strategy largely due to the delivery barriers discussed above(Fig. 1)[ 23]. For example, the negatively charged DNA typically cannot cross the anionic cell membrane without an exogenous transfectionreagent or delivery vehicle [ 24], and once within cells, DNA needs to surpass the nuclear membrane and enter the nucleus [ 24]. Lastly, it is critical that DNA is transfected into the desired cells with minimal o - target expression [ 25-28]. Several physical techniques to improve DNAdelivery including gene guns, electroporation, and sonoporation are commonly used ex vivo and in small animals [ 29,30], but they are either not feasible for in vivo use,or they are limited to local delivery [ 24]. Utilizing NPs as DNA delivery vehicles can overcome the aforemen- tioned limitations, and several unique applications are described below [24]. Several types of LNPs, including liposomes, ionizable lipids, and polymer-lipid NPs, have been developed to deliver DNA to target cells. Liposomes were among the rst DNA delivery systems and are the furthest in clinical development, as they are currently used clinically totreat cancer [ 31]. Liposomes are composed of materials with polar head groups and non-polar tails, and they spontaneously self-assemble intovesicles at low concentrations 32,33]. Cationic lipids, such as DOTMA, DOTAP and zwitterionic DOPE, are commonly used to form cationicliposomes by exploiting electrostatic interactions between lipids and negatively-charged nucleic acids ( Fig. 2a). When used to encapsulate DNA or other drugs, these cationic liposomes induce stronger ther-apeutic e ects than free drug, which has led to several cationic lipo- somal drug formulations advancing into clinical trials [ 34-38]. How- ever, the use of cationic liposomes is limited due to toxicity at the site of administration [ 39-41], undesired immune responses [ 42], and clot formation [ 43], all of which can limit the allowable administered dose [41,44-48]. As an alternative to traditional cationic liposomes, ionizable lipids that are neutral at physiologic pH ( 7.4) but ionize under acidic conditions, such as those found within endosomes, have been devel-oped for nucleic acid delivery [ 49-51]. The ability of these lipids to buer endosomal compartments by taking on positive charges can promote endosomal escape and enable processing of the nucleic acids in the cytosol [ 51,52]. Ionizable LNPs typically have 3 components in addition to the ionizable lipid itself; a fusogenic helper phospholipid(DSPC, DOPE, DOTC, DOTMA, POPC) [ 53,54], cholesterol to increase stability and membrane fusion [ 55,56], and a lipid-anchored poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) to extend their circulatory half-life and de-crease non-speci c protein b) [ 54]. Ionizable LNPs have been used and melanoma [ 57]. NPs exhibited preferential accumulation and uptake by immune cells inlymph nodes and augmented antigen-speci c immune cell and cyto- kine/chemokine responses, ultimately leading to greater tumor rejec-tion in a murine EG7-OVA tumor model [ 57]. Although ionizable LNPs have been shown to e ectively load nucleic acids of relatively small size (e.g. short synthetic DNA, siRNA, and microRNA), encapsulating large cargo (e.g. pDNA) is challenging [ 58-60]. Thus, new classes of condense pDNA into NPs and enhance transgene expression as described below. Cationic polymeric NPs can be engineered to possess speci c phy- sicochemical properties, such as hydrophobicity and charge, due to the diverse range of available polymers and chemical modi cations [ 27]. This chemical diversity allows researchers to utilize polymeric NPs fordelivery to a wide array of cell types [ 69]. Poly( L-lysine) (PLL) is a homopolymer of the amino acid lysine that has been shown to e ec- tively condense DNA ( Fig. 2c) [ 70]. Studies indicate that PLL generally has low transfection success, likely due to its low rate of endosomalescape [ 24]. However, one study used PLL-coated polystyrene NPs to deliver pDNA encoding OVA antigen as a model for a DNA-based pro-phylactic cancer vaccine against EG7 tumor cells [ 70]. Two vaccina- tions with these NPs inhibited tumor growth following a EG7 tumor cellchallenge in mice [ 70]. Notably, immature dendritic cells (DCs) had higher levels of NP uptake compared to mature DCs [ 70], which is likely due to the reduced endocytic and phagocytic rates in mature DCs that lowers their capacity to internalize and process antigens [ 70].A.J. Mukalel, et al. Cancer Letters 458 (2019) 102-112 103Similar to PLL, polyethylenimine (PEI) is another cationic polymer that is often used as a \"gold-standard \"for transfection e cacy ( Fig. 2c) [24,71]. PEI exerts a high charge density at low pH, which enhances endosomal escape and makes it a potent transfection reagent, but it also confers high cytotoxicity [ 72-76]. Longer chain and higher charge density PEIs tend to have damaging interactions with cellular mem-branes that lead to potent cytotoxicity, and several strategies have emerged to address this including branched architectures, biodegrad- ability, and PEG-grafting [ 74,75,77]. In one instance, modi ed bran- ched PEI was synthesized to improve upon the cytocompatibility andtransfection e ciency of unmodi ed PEI [ 74]. Of note, succinylated PEI induced better siRNA-mediated knockdown and 10-fold lowerpolymer toxicity compared to unmodi ed PEI [ 74]. This demonstrates the importance of balancing transfection e ciency and biocompat- ibility when designing PEI-based delivery vehicles. The high transfec- tion ability of PEI was exploited for cancer immunotherapy by con- densing IL-12-encoding pDNA [ 78]. This therapy was administered as an aerosol to mice bearing SAOS-LM7 tumors in a murine model ofosteosarcoma lung metastasis [ 78]. Mice that received aerosolized PEI- IL-12 gene therapy exhibited IL-12 expression only in the lungs and hadsignicantly fewer lung metastases than untreated controls [ 78]. The ability of PEI to condense DNA is also applicable to newer polymer-based NP delivery platforms, such as PBAEs, described below. PBAEs are simple to synthesize and they provide an additional Fig. 1. The role of NPs in overcoming extracellular and intracellular barriers for nucleic acid delivery. In the circulation, NPs need to protect nucleic acids from serum endo- and exo-nucleases, evade immune detection, and avoid non-speci c protein interactions within the blood. Further, NPs must avoid renal clearance (achieved through size modulation), while also promoting extravasation from the blood and into target tissues, upon which they promote cellular uptake and localization into the cytosol or nucleus.

A major ad- vantage of their simple, parallelizable synthesis is the ability to gen- erate diverse libraries of PBAE structures that can be screened for DNA delivery to identify key structures for potent gene delivery [ 80]. In the context of immunotherapy, PBAE NPs functionalized with an anti-CD3e T-cell-targeting antibody fragment used to deliver leukemia spe- cic CD194-1BBz CAR pDNA to T-cells in situ in a murine leukemia model ( Fig. 3a) [ 81]. These NPs also contained microtubule-associated sequence (MTAS) and nuclear localization signal (NLS) peptides to mediate nuclear translocation of the therapeutic pDNA cargo [ 81]. NP- programmed CAR T-cells generated tumor regression similar to that oftraditionally prepared CAR T-cells, with only a small portion of NPs transducing phagocytic cells, likely due to successful antibody targeting to T-cells [ 81]. PBAEs have also been used to deliver cyclic dinucleo- tides (a STING agonist) or CpG nucleic acid adjuvants ( Fig. 3 b) [82,83]. Notably, results from these studies indicated that the PBAE:DNA ratio is a critical factor for NP stability and in vivo functionality. Speci cally, PBAE-NPs with higher PBAE:DNA ratios yielded better protection of theCpG cargo. However, lower ratios exhibited better CpG uptake and activation of tumor-speci c T-cells, resulting in improved survival in a mouse melanoma model [ 82,83]. With the aid of NP delivery systems, DNA-based therapeutics haveshown great promise in the eld of cancer immunotherapy [ 84]. Al- though using pDNA as an antigen source has shown encouraging out-comes in many preclinical studies, the same success has not been found in human clinical trials, and interest in using DNA as antigen sources has decreased [ 84,85]. However, there is substantial ongoing work to develop DNA NPs in immunotherapy for CAR T-cells or as adjuvants [81,82,86]. More recently, mRNA has emerged as a potent tool for gene immunotherapy for cancer, and several unique applications are de-scribed below. 3. Nanoparticles for mRNA delivery Early interest in mRNA stemmed from its use as an alternative to conventional and DNA-based vaccines [ 87]. mRNA therapeutics are a promising alternative to DNA owing to their lower mutational risk, fewer intracellular delivery barriers, and transient expression[24,88,89]. Further, mRNA only needs to cross the cell membrane and reach the cytosol -in contrast to DNA which requires nuclear entry - to induce protein translation [ 88-90]. Finally, protein expression induced by mRNA is transient and does not require integration into the genome,thereby avoiding the risk of insertional mutagenesis that can occur from DNA [ 24,88,89]. When used as a vaccine, mRNAs encoding for antigens Fig. 2.

Structurally, cationic lipids are de ned as having a cationic head group, linker region, and hydrophobic tails. B.Ionizable lipid LNP formulations are of ionizable such C.Cationic polymers and biopolymers used as vectors for nucleic acid delivery. PEI and PLL were two of the initial vectors used for DNA delivery but are faced with safety (PEI) and ecacy (PLL) concerns. PBAEs and pDMAEMA are newer polymer vectors developed for nucleic acid delivery with improved safety and ecacy. Adapted with permission from Ref. [ 24].A.J. Mukalel, et al. Cancer Letters 458 (2019) 102-112 105are delivered to antigen presenting cells, either through ex vivo trans- fection or under systemic administration. Antigen presenting cells then translate mRNA into its encoded cancer-associated antigen that is pre- sented to T-cells for activation and induction of cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses [ 87]. However, the large size (103-105nucleotides), negative charge, and hydrophilicity of mRNA, combined with its susceptibility tonucleases, hinder the ability of naked mRNA to reach and enter target cells upon systemic administration [ 14,24,88-90]. NPs can overcome these barriers and facilitate its intracellular delivery, and several NPplatforms for mRNA delivery are described below. Similar to DNA delivery, ionizable LNPs have also been used for mRNA delivery. In one example of this, LNPs comprised of an ionizable lipid, a helper phospholipid, cholesterol, lipid-anchored PEG , and mRNA were designed to induce expression of luciferase and ery- thropoietin following systemic injection in BALB/c mice [ 91]. The study utilized Design of Experiment (DoE) methodology to optimize atop-performing LNP for siRNA delivery to now deliver mRNA to the liver of mice [ 91]. In the context of immunotherapy, multilamellar ionizable LNPs were to glycoprotein 100 (gp100) tumor self-antigen mRNAs antigen to induce a cytotoxic CD8 T-cell response ( Fig. 3d). Subcutaneous administration of these LNPs led to reductions in tumorvolume, extended survival in a B16F10 tumor model, and yielded po- tent CD8 +activation [ 49]. Interestingly, these LNPs neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells, demonstratingthat they may be useful to deliver mRNA to a range of immune cells. Similar to DNA delivery, the chemical diversity of polymers andpolymer-lipid systems allows for identi cation and incorporation of structures that can improve biocompatibility and bioavailability of the encapsulated materials [ 27]. Polymers used for mRNA delivery are positively charged and can condense mRNA into nanometer sizedelectrostatic complexes [ 88]. PBAEs are a major class of pH-responsive and bioreducible polymers known for their biocompatibility, but theyhave had limited in vivo success due to their poor serum stability [92,93]. Recent PBAE work has explored the incorporation of PEG-li- pids and new PBAE architectures to improve uptake, stability, and biodistribution [ 94-96]. In one approach, PBAEs were modi ed to in- clude internal alkyl tails to enable their formulation with PEG-lipidsand improve their stability under physiologic conditions [ PEG-lipids demonstratedgreater stability in vitro compared to those formulated without PEG-lipids, and they achieved selective luciferase expression in thelungs of mice following intravenous injection [ 96]. PBAEs have also been used for immunization, where lipid-enveloped NPs withpH-responsive PBAE cores delivered mRNA to immune cells [ 97]. Mucosal immunization has drawn interest for two reasons: 1) manypathogens invade through mucosal surfaces and 2) mucosal im- munizations can elicit both systemic and mucosal immunity [ 98,99]. These NPs successfully delivered GFP mRNA to di cult-to-transfect dendritic cells in vitro as well as luciferase mRNA to mucosal tissue compartments following intranasal administration in vivo [97]. Vaccination is a central application of mRNA for cancer im- munotherapy. Electroporation is typically used to introduce mRNA intoT-cells ex vivo , which can induce cellular toxicity [ 13]. Further, this ex Fig. 3. NPs for nucleic acid delivery and their applications in cancer immunotherapy. A.A PBAE polymer functionalized with an MTAS-NLS peptide was used to condense CAR-encoding plasmid DNA. In this application, an anti-CD3e-poly(glutamic acid) (PGA) conjugate was adsorbed to the surface of the PBAE core to enable T-cell targeting and in situ generation of CAR T-cells.

Cancer Letters 458 (2019) 102-112 106vivo cell engineering process is time, labor, and cost intensive, which creates signi cant challenges towards broader clinical translation [100]. Thus, NPs are ideal to deliver mRNA to T-cells without the need for electroporation. An early mRNA cancer vaccine approach utilized PEGylated mRNA B16-speci c CD4 + and CD8+T-cells, leading to a 10-fold reduction in tumor volume and a 75% reduction in detectable lung metastases compared to control mice in a B16/F10 melanoma model [ 101]. More recently, PBAE NPs were coated with CD3 or CD8 antibodies and target T-cells PBAE NPs [ 12]. Building upon this success, this robust platform has been used to deliver two di erent mRNAs. In one study, these NPs delivered megaTAL to knockout endogenous cause disease [ 12]. Separately, NPs loaded with an mRNA encoding the Foxo1 3Atranscription factor were used to guide CD62L+T-cells away from terminal di erentiation and senescence, and towards a central memory phenotype [ 12]. Taken to- gether, these results indicate that this robust platform can be adapted to generate several distinct immune responses. Recently, mRNA vaccines have begun testing in clinical trials. The clinical translation of mRNA vaccines is being led, in part, by Curevac (NCT03291002) with an RNA-based adjuvant that is being tested in patients with melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma, among others. With the introduction of these vaccines into the clinic, researchers are increasingly working towards introducing mRNA delivery systems as well. LNPs complexed with NY-ESO-1, MAGE-A3, tyrosinase, and TPTE mRNA are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Early phase 1 dose escalation data has demonstrated that neutral or negativelycharged LNP-mRNA complexes are well tolerated, and there were dose dependent IFN- and antigen-speci c T-cell responses in three mela- noma patients [ 20]. Together with the preclinical studies described above, this demonstrates that NPs can aid in overcoming challenges associated with mRNA delivery, and enable potential use for multiple forms of cancer immunotherapy. 4. Nanoparticles for gene editing CRISPR/Cas9 has emerged as a powerful tool in understanding and treating the genetic cause of various diseases ( Fig. 4)[ 102,103]. In the context of cancer immunotherapy, CRISPR has been applied to disease modeling [ 104- 106], target identi cation [ gineering [ 111]. CRISPR/Cas9 can be delivered as a acid- protein (ribonucleoprotein, or RNP) or as nucleic acids [112,113]. Protein delivery presents several challenges, and strategies for overcoming these barriers have been reviewed elsewhere[114- 116]. In contrast to nucleic acids, the chemical diversity and size of proteins often necessitates modi cations to enable delivery with a vector [ 117,118]. For example, a successful approach is to \"super- charge \"proteins through the addition of densely charged moieties to enable electrostatic complexation with carriers [ 117,118], and this approach has been particularly e ective in the localized delivery of Cas9 RNP NPs [ 119- 121]. Delivery of mRNA o er transient protein expres- cial because constitutive sion can increase the risk for o -target editing and stimulation of pre- existing adaptive immune responses to the Cas9 protein [ 122-124]. However, the most successful attempts at formulating Cas9 RNP into NPs have been limited to localized delivery, whereas Cas9 mRNA hasbeen successfully delivered via systemic administration [119- 121,124-126]. Since CRISPR/Cas9 technology is still relatively new, there have been few attempts to deliver Cas9 components usingNPs for the purpose of cancer immunotherapy. Here, we highlight NP delivery systems that have delivered CRISPR/Cas9 to treat non-cancer diseases, as well as viral delivery mechanisms for cancer im- munotherapy. Moving forward, we anticipate that the critical insights gained from the gene editing studies discussed below will form the basis for NP-mediated gene editing for cancer immunotherapy. One of the rst successful Cas9 NP approaches utilized viral and non-viral NP delivery to achieve homology directed repair in hepato- cytes in a mouse model of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 [ 124]. A li- pidoid-based LNP was used to encapsulate Cas9 mRNA and, due to sizeconstraints, the sgRNA expression cassette and homology directed re- pair template were delivered using an adeno-associated virus (AAV) [124]. After optimizing the timing of LNP and AAV administration to maximize the overlap between peak Cas9 and sgRNA expression, thissystem achieved gene editing in 6% of hepatocytes at a 24.1% indel rate measured by deep sequencing of the target locus in total liver genomic DNA [ 124]. In a di erent proof-of-concept study, modi ed to reduce serum concentrations of transthyretin, and achieved 70% gene editing and > 97% knockdown in hepatocytes following a single intravenous injection in mice ( Fig. 3c) [ 126]. In another example of NP- mediated Cas9 delivery, Miller et al. synthesized a library of zwitter-ionic lipids (ZALs) to co-deliver expressing a Lox-Stop-Lox tdTomato cassette, and demonstrated stable gene editing two months after NP administration [ 125]. ZALs demonstrated potent protein expression with luciferase mRNA atdoses < 600 pM in vitro and l mg/kg in vivo [125]. Together, these early examples of NP delivery platforms for genome editing preface their usefor CRISPR/Cas9 nucleic acid delivery for cancer immunotherapy. In the preceding text, we highlighted successful preclinical appli- cations of NPs for the delivery of Cas9 components. Here, we describe the use of CRISPR/Cas9 for cancer immunotherapy mediated by viral and physical delivery methods. One important use of CRISPR/Cas9 inimmunotherapy is towards more robust T-cell engineering. Allogeneic CAR T-cells are an attractive alternative to traditional autologous CAR T-cells because they can be distributed \"o-the-shelf \"to patients [127,128]. However, allogeneic transplant T-cell receptors (TCRs) can be reactive to host antigens in healthy tissues, leading to graft-versus- host disease (GVHD) [ 128,129]. Additionally, alloantigens present on transplanted cells, such as human leukocyte antigen-1 (HLA-1), canelicit unwanted host immune responses [ 128,129]. CRISPR/Cas9 could be employed to knock-out surface molecules to improve the compat-ibility of allogeneic CAR T-cells [ 128-131]. An early study utilized a combination of CRISPR mRNA and gRNA to target the T-cell Receptoralpha-constant (TRAC) locus and knock out TCRs. Subsequent trans- fection with an AAV encoding CAR cDNA was used to induce expression of CD19-speci c CAR under transcriptional control of the TRAC pro- moter. These T-cells were more resistant to tonic signaling and haddelayed di erentiation and exhaustion, ultimately leading to greater tumor rejection when compared to retrovirally transduced CARs, bothwith and without TCR knockout [ 108]. CRISPR/Cas9 targeting enabled the identi cation of a speci c transcriptional regulator that modulated CAR expression to maximize therapeutic bene t. While single gene editing has several applications, the simplicity of CRISPR/Cas9 gives rise to the capability of multiplexed gene editing to simultaneously knock-out several genes. In one example, Cas9 mRNA and gRNAs were delivered to primary T-cells via electroporation and used to knock out PD-1, a suppressor of CD8 T-cell activity, in addition to TCR and HLA-1 [ 111,132]. A lentivirus was used to transduce CD19 prostate-stem antigen (PSCA) CARs. Double knockout (TCR- andHLA-1-) CAR T-cells yielded reduced alloreactivity compared to single knockout (TCR-) CAR T-cells while maintaining potent antitumor ac- tivity, measured by enhanced survival in a Nalm6 mouse tumor model [111]. Triple knockout (TCR-, HLA-1-, and PD-1-) CAR T-cells demon- strated quicker and complete elimination of tumor cells compared todouble-ablated CAR T-cells in an aggressive Nalm6-PDL1 leukemiaA.J. Mukalel, et al. Cancer Letters 458 (2019) 102-112 107model [ 111]. These results highlight the utility for CRISPR/Cas9 tech- nologies for improving CAR T-cell therapy and their potential for clinical application. While CRISPR/Cas9 is a potent new tool for treating and under- standing disease, but e ective intracellular delivery remains a chal- lenge. The applications of CRISPR/Cas9 in cancer immunotherapypreviously mentioned rely on combinations of physical and viral de- livery methods to achieve gene editing [ 108,111]. Additionally, Cas9 transfection was performed ex vivo and in homogenous cell populations, further simplifying the challenge of delivery [ 108,111]. However, there has been successful NP mediated delivery of Cas9 components to im-mune cells. In one example of targeted CRISPR/Cas9 expression, was delivered using NPs (CLANs) that were administered intravenously to type 2 diabetic mice. The CRISPR/Cas9 gene was designed to be under tran- scriptional control of the CD68 promoter unique to monocytes and macrophages in order to decrease o -target Cas9 expression [ 133]. These particles were used to knock out Ntn1, a guidance cue that blocksmacrophage migration in adipose tissue and leads to insulin sensitivity and in flammation. Gene editing was achieved in vivo primarily in macrophages and monocytes, with little editing occurring in neu-trophils or other o -target immune cells [ 133,134]. In another example of NP-mediated Cas9 delivery, Li et al. screened a library of PEG-PLGA,PLGA, BHEM-Chol, and DOTAP NPs for delivery of Cas9 plasmids to B cells in vivo. After identifying a lead candidate based on accumulation in the spleen and lymph node, the lead formulation was used to correct Bcell dysfunction in a rheumatoid arthritis model [ 135]. Although NPs are still being developed to deliver CRISPR/Cas9 components to im-mune cells, these early examples of successful in vivo delivery preclude their use for gene editing in cancer. As previously mentioned, the eld of NPs to deliver CRISPR/Cas9 for cancer immunotherapy is nascent. The early research into the role ofgene editing in cancer immunotherapy, especially the examples of T- cell engineering mentioned above, has yielded promising results as wellas insight into the future directions in immunotherapy [ 108,111]. Concurrently, NPs are being developed to deliver Cas9 components,and have demonstrated e cacy in doing so in both immune and non- immune cells [ 124- 126,133,135].5. Future directions and conclusions Currently, most forms of immunotherapy and their NP-based de- livery systems have been primarily e ective at targeting hematological cancers or melanoma [ 7]. Moving forward, there is great opportunity to study how NPs can be utilized to treat solid tumors by exploiting their unique physicochemical properties. This engineering challenge can be faced by carefully choosing materials that are known to e ciently transfect cells (such as cationic lipids and polymers) [ 11,50], have highly controllable sizes and surface chemistry [ 16,24,136], and those that can be functionalized with targeting ligands to promote uptake bytissues and cells of interest. In an elegant example of NP targeting for solid tumor immunotherapy, LNPs loaded with a DNA plasmid and cationic functionalized with targeting ligands cells [ 137]. These targeted NPs were intravenously injected into mice with orthotopic colorectal tumors, and mice treatedwith NPs and chemotherapy experienced greater tumor inhibition compared to mice treated with chemotherapy alone [ 137]. The im- provements gained by incorporating targeting ligands onto NPs can beattributed to enhanced target binding strength, biodistribution, and uptake that may decrease the doses required to produce therapeutic eects [ 138]. The improvements a orded by incorporating targeting ligands onto NPs are particularly attractive for transfecting various subtypes of lymphocytes directly in vivo for adoptive T-cell therapy. For example, PEG-PEI targeted to T-cells using CD3 antibodies induced transfectionand functional regulation of T-cells in vivo in a rat allogeneic heart transplantation model [ 139]. In the context of cancer immunotherapy, antibody-targeted PLGA NPs have been engineered to bind PD-1+ T- cells in blood, lymphoid tissues, and tumors to deliver TGF inhibitors [136]. These complexes were shown to improve survival of melanoma- bearing mice compared to administration of free drug, an e ect at- tributed to targeting this speci c population of T-cells. This study de- monstrated the concept that NPs can be used to target speci c types of lymphocytes in vivo, which has the potential to expand the eld of cancer immunotherapy in several ways. First, targeting T-cells in vivo can initiate speci c anti-tumor immune responses for solid tumor im- munotherapy, as described in the study above [ 136]. Second, this Fig. 4. Methods for genome editing nucleases (ZFN), transcription activator-like nuclease CRISPR- Cas systems can be delivered with non-viral delivery platforms such as NPs. These gene editing systems can edit mammalian gen-omes by introducing double stranded breaks in a highly speci c, sequence-dependent manner. Repair occurs through non-homo- logous end-joining or by homology-directedrepair. Adapted with permission from Ref. [112].A.J. Mukalel, et al. Cancer Letters 458 (2019) 102-112 108technique can be used to generate CAR T-cells directly in vivo to over- come the many manufacturing limitations of in vitro CAR T-cell devel- opment, including high costs and production time [ 12]. Lastly, the ability to activate speci c subpopulations of immune cells in circulation may be exploited to treat metastatic secondary tumors in addition to primary tumors, as these engineered cells can target any cancer cells throughout the body that express the target protein [ 101]. Another means of utilizing nanotechnology for immunotherapy in solid tumors is by alleviating immunosuppressive signaling within the microenvironment to improve native T-cell responses ( Fig. 5)[ 140]. For example, delivering siRNA against Snail, a critical transcriptionfactor that accelerates cancer metastasis by inducing immunosuppres- sion, to tumor cells was shown to promote the in ltration of tumor- specic lymphocytes into melanoma tumors [ 140]. This increase in lymphocyte in ltration led to inhibited primary and metastatic tumor growth [ 140]. By utilizing NPs to enhance anti-tumor immune re- sponses against solid tumors, researchers can exploit the inherent function of immune cells to attack cancer cells, which may be more eective for treating solid tumors compared to treating tumor cells themselves [ 141]. Moving forward, this technique to potentially make solid tumors more susceptible to native immune activity could be combined with in vivo targeting of immune cells for a multi-pronged approach to solid tumor immunotherapy [ 141]. In addition to developing delivery systems to enable solid tumor immunotherapy, it is also critical to engineer NPs to deliver geneediting tools [ 24]. Previously, we discussed the use of NPs to deliver CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing material to immune cells to treat diabetesand rheumatoid arthritis, as well as the viral delivery of gene editing technology for cancer immunotherapy [ 108,111,133,135]. There are several challenges to address as researchers develop nanotechnology todeliver gene editing components in vivo for cancer immunotherapy. A critical consideration is developing NPs that o er precise control over timing of nucleic acid delivery and release, as successful gene editing requires delivery of both guide RNA as well as the Cas9 protein ormRNA [ 124]. This challenge can be met by developing NPs usingmaterials with highly tunable degradation pro les to release the nucleic acid cargo on-demand [ 18]. Additionally, NPs carrying gene editing components need to successfully edit a su cient number of cells to mediate the desired therapeutic result, which can be challenge in vivo where immune cells are circulating throughout the body. This re-quirement can be met by attaching targeting ligands to NPs to promote their binding and uptake to target cells [ 19,136]. Ultimately, NPs that can deliver gene editing technology for cancer immunotherapy can exploit the delivery capabilities of the carriers as well as the highly specic editing a orded by CRISPR/Cas9 systems. The NP delivery platforms discussed in this article represent novel and recent developments in nucleic acid delivery, with several appli- cations in cancer immunotherapy. However, challenges remain before these systems can be used broadly in the clinic. For example, several of the examples discussed above utilize materials that have not yet been used in clinical trials or are not yet approved by the FDA. NPs com- prised of FDA approved materials may have a simpler and expedited path towards clinical translation. Importantly, several NP-based gene therapeutics are in clinical trials or have been recently approved by the FDA. For example, in 2018 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals gained FDA ap- proval for their lipid-siRNA NP Onpattro to treat polyneuropathy caused transthyretin amyloidosis [ 142]. This introduction of NP- nucleic acid complexes into the clinic is a critical milestone for theentry of other NP-based immunotherapies into clinical trials and ulti- mately for FDA approval. As new NP delivery systems enter the clinic, physicians and scientists can begin to shift the current paradigm of cancer therapy towards potent and biocompatible nucleic acid delivery systems for immunotherapy.
