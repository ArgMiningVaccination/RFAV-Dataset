The use of EOs for unsubstantiated healing, and especially for emotional or spiritual purposes, is soundly rooted in the occult/New Age. See links at the end of post for more information. I have posted many times on Essential Oils and at least once on Ayurveda, a healing system based on Hindu beliefs.... I have pointed out that the Essential Oil industry comes from the New Age fields of Aromatherapy and Bach Flower Remedies. Aromatherapy is not about things smelling good but about the belief that a vital force is in the essence of plants which has healing and spiritual benefits. Notice that I said \"vital force\" of the plants, not the physical properties of the plants. Because of this background, it is almost impossible to find a website selling Essential Oils that is not also promoting New Age beliefs and/or practices. Even sites that are Christian do this because so-called alternative healing invaded the church years ago. People don't realize that New Age deception is subtle and can sound scientific or even Christian. Below is a promotion from a New Age source that verifies my previous claims: \"Are you ready to discover how to use essential oils to enhance your immune system, cultivate more prana, dispel inflammation and relax your mood? Receive profound Aromatherapy insights to access the power of essential oils such as rose, vetiver, sandalwood, agarwood and jatamansi for your health, wellbeing and personal transformation. Have you been fascinated by the way essential oils can affect your emotions and expand your consciousness? Curiosity about plants' powers has led to a profound new understanding that links our biology, our ecology, our consciousness and our felt sense of connection with all of life. Ancient systems of natural healing, such as Ayurveda, have shown us that plants have remarkable properties that can help transform our life's journey. They can heal our bodies, open our minds, and even reverse aging. And, beyond the benefits to our physical health, they can put us into a state of deeper communion with the natural world. This subject is not only the province of mystics, shamans and natural medicine practitioners, but is increasingly vital for all of us to maintain healthy bodies and a thriving Earth. The ancient science of Ayurveda offers a fascinating and highly refined system for healing that's particularly focused on balancing the energies in the body \u2014 what it calls \"doshas\" \u2014 and what we might think of as \"energetic types.\" The simple daily use of essential oils can have a profound effect on your wellbeing, bringing you more balance, harmony and vibrant health.\" COMMENT: Notice how creation and the concept of \"natural\" are exalted. Because I continue to get asked about EOs and continue to hear how they are invading and damaging people in the church..... [Source]- edited by me Ayurveda, a Hindu-based \"alternative\" healing modality, continues to gain ground. The West has been brainwashed to believe that \"ancient\" healing methods from other times or cultures, like Shamanism or the East, are superior and something we have missed out on. The problem is that these methods are based on spiritual beliefs, not science. There is usually little or no science supporting these practices, and any science there is often there by accident. Ayurveda was initiated in this country by Mahariji Mahesh Yogi (known as the guru discovered by the Beatles), who also started the big TM (Transcendental Meditation - recently exposed on this page) wave. Ayurveda is as scientific and spiritual as TM. Just released in May of this year, \"The Wheel of Healing\" by Michelle S. Fondin, about Ayurveda: \"Ayurveda, the 'science of life,' is a complete wellness system that includes all that we associate with medical care \u2014 prevention of disease, observation, diagnosis, and treatment \u2014 as well as self-care practices that are generally absent from Western medicine. This truly holistic approach considers not just diet, exercise, and genetics but also relationships, life purpose, finances, environment, and past experiences.\" [Source] The author: \"Michelle S. Fondin holds a Vedic Master Certificate from the Chopra Center and is a member of the National Ayurvedic Medical Association and Yoga Alliance. She treats clients at her Ayurvedic Path center, speaks and offers workshops, and lives in Herndon, Virginia.\" (from Amazon) COMMENTS: Naturally, the term \"science\" is used, as is true of all these alternative treatments. Note that the author has a degree from the Chopra Center, New Ager Deepak Chopra's center. What is Ayurveda? No need to go to a Hindu or New Age source for info! Nope. Now that spiritually based beliefs are growing like weeds in health care, we can just go to the Univ. of Maryland Medical Center: \"....each person has a distinct pattern of energy \u2014 a specific combination of physical, mental, and emotional characteristics. Ayurvedic practitioners also believe there are three basic energy types called doshas, present in every person: Vata \u2014 Energy that controls bodily functions associated with motion, including blood circulation, breathing, blinking, and heartbeat. When vata energy is balanced, there is creativity and vitality. Out of balance, vata produces fear and anxiety. Pitta \u2014 Energy that controls the body's metabolic systems, including digestion, absorption, nutrition, and temperature. In balance, pitta leads to contentment and intelligence. Out of balance, pitta can cause ulcers and arouse anger. Kapha \u2014 Energy that controls growth in the body. It supplies water to all body parts, moisturizes the skin, and maintains the immune system. In balance, kapha is expressed as love and forgiveness. Out of balance, kapha leads to insecurity and envy.\" Source: Ayurveda | University of Maryland Medical Center .................................. What kind of treatments might one expect? They may include: \"Pranayama \u2014 breathing exercises. Practicing pranayama helps you feel calm. Abhyanga \u2014 rubbing the skin with herbal oil to increase blood circulation and draw toxins out of the body through the skin. Rasayana \u2014 using mantras (repeated words or phrases) during meditation combined with certain herbs for rejuvenation. Yoga \u2014 combining pranayama, movement, and meditation. Yoga has been shown to improve circulation and digestion, and to reduce blood pressure, cholesterol levels, anxiety, and chronic pain. Pancha karma \u2014 cleansing the body to purify it and reduce cholesterol. Practitioners use methods that cause sweat, bowel movements, and even vomit to cleanse the body of toxins. Herbal medicines \u2014 prescribing herbs to restore dosha balance.\" from same Univ. of Md link above [Source]- edited by me Yoga, Pranayama, Prana, Energy, etc. are all New Age or Hindu concepts and/or practices. If you don't know Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, you can receive Him into your heart, and He can deliver you from darkness and sin and have your name written in His Book of Life. If you are sincere, you can say this simple prayer to the Father (it doesn't have to be word for word): \"God, I recognize that I have not lived my life for You up until now. I have been living for myself and that is wrong. Please forgive me of all of my sins just as I forgive others. I need You in my life; I want You in my life. I acknowledge the completed work of Your only begotten Son Jesus Christ in giving His life for me on the cross, I believe in my heart Jesus is Lord and was raised from the dead and I long to receive the forgiveness you have made freely available to me through this sacrifice. Come into my life now, Lord. Take up residence in my heart and be my king, my Lord, and my Savior. From this day forward, I will no longer be controlled by sin, or the desire to please myself, but I will follow You all the days of my life. Those days are in Your hands. I ask this in the Lord and GOD Jesus' precious and "}
