Don't stare at the pencil, instead quickly glance at it and then change your vision to an object which is on the opposite side of the room which is 10-20 feet. Do this for a few seconds and then go back to the pencil for a few seconds. - Repeat this process 10 times and do it every day. As your eyesight starts to get better, start focusing on objects that are farther away from you. Exercise 2 : Blinking exercise - Reduces eye strain Blinking is a simple way to keep our eyes fresh and helps them to focus for a longer period of time. Computer users and television watchers tend to blink less, especially when they are intently focused on something. This situation makes eyes fatigue in addition to other symptoms of dry eyes. Whenever we blink, our eyes are going into a brief period of darkness which helps to keep our eyes fresh and discharges previous information to make them ready for new information, which reduces eye strain. What we have to do is just fully close our eyes tightly for 3-4 seconds, and then open them for 3-4 seconds. Repeat this exercise for 7-8 times, every time you feel tiredness in the eyes. Exercise 3 : The \"Figure Eight Exercise\" - Strengthen eye muscle The Figure Eight. This a great exercise for your eye muscles.

This exercise helps you increase your eyes flexibility if done regularly. This exercise will strengthen the muscles in your eyes over time and improve your vision overall. Exercise 4 : Palming This exercise helps relieve stress around the eyes and gives our eyes a much needed break. When we placing our palms around our eyes, we are stimulating very powerful acupuncture points which help to calm the mind, relax the muscles around the eyes and channel healing energy to the eyes. (Marc Grossman). How to do Palming : - Make yourself comfortable while leaning forward on a desk or with your elbows resting on your knees. - Place your two hands over your eyes with the cup of your palm covering your eyes, your fingers on your forehead and the heel of your hand will rest on your cheekbone. Make sure you can blink freely and are not putting too much pressure on your eyes. - Remain in this situation for a few minutes (3-5 minutes) Palming gives you the opportunity to rest your mind and your eyes for a few minutes at a time. It may not sound like much of an exercise but it can make a big difference in your working day if you stop for a few minutes and do this exercise. Position during palming exercise Exercise 5 : \"Zooming\" This exercise is a very effective eye focusing exercise, in which you have to constantly adjust the length of your focus. This helps strengthen your eye muscles and also flexibility of the eye movement. How to practice \"Zooming\": - Sit in a comfortable position. - Stretch out your arm in front of you while rolling your finger tightly into your palm with thumb up. - Focus on your thumb as your arm is outstretched. - Now bring your thumb closer to you, focusing until your thumb is about 3 inches (6 cm) (5 minutes) in front of your face. - Now move your thumb away again until your arm is fully outstretched. - Do this for a few minutes at a time throughout the day. Conclusion In a study by Rathod Vandama J et.al it was concluded that, eye exercises are effective in improving near focusing but not improving any blurring of vision. Eye exercises can help in a number of different ways : - Increase eye function and help you focus better - Reduce eyestrain - Reduce sensitivity to light - Increase or strengthen your eye muscles - Help with other aspects of vision such as hand-eye coordination, depth perception, peripheral vision, etc Your lifestyle will also play a big role in the effectiveness of exercises. If you continue to have poor visual habits, like looking at the computer screen for prolonged periods with no breaks, then the effectiveness will also be reduced.
