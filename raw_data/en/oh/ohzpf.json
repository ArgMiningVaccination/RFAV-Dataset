These oils have been used for centuries in different parts of the world as a natural way to maintain healthy and youthful skin. Our combinations give a complexity to our formulas that provide minerals, vitamins, proteins and fatty acids from a wide range of oils. These oils are carefully chosen to help each other act as a catalyst to bring the oils deep into your skin, while also providing antioxidants, anti-inflammatory properties and wide range of vitamins and Amino acids. These combinations of ingredients provide a potent nourishment to maintain healthy and well-balanced skin, while aiding in skin conditions, fine lines, and wrinkles. Learn more about the all-natural ingredients used in our skincare products: Tallow - 100% Grass-fed According to The Weston A. Price Foundation: Tallow contains the abundant natural fat-soluble activators, vitamins A, D, and K, as well as vitamin E, which are found only in animal fats and which are all necessary for general health and for skin health. Tallow (especially tallow from grass-fed animals) also contains fats like conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), which has anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties, as well as palmitoleic acid, which has natural antimicrobial properties. Dr. Mary Enig cites a 2006 study on fats showing that CLA, which is found in high concentrations in tallow, has significant anti-cancer effects, and that supplying tallow increased those effects due its palmitic acid, another fatty acid. Tallow fat is typically 50 to 55 percent saturated, just like our cell membranes, with almost all of the rest being monounsaturated, so it makes sense that it would be helpful for skin health and compatible with our cell biology. Coconut Oil Coconut Oil is wonderful as a face cleanser, moisturizer and sun screen, but also it can treat many skin disorders. The fatty acids (Caprylic and Lauric) in coconut oil reduce inflammation internally and externally and moisturize making them a great solution for all types of skin conditions. It protects the skin and has many antioxidants that make it ideal for healing the skin. In addition the antimicrobial properties balance out the candida or fungal sources that can cause many skin conditions. Shea Butter Shea Butter is a skin superfood that comes from the seeds of the fruit of the Shea (Karite) tree and that is naturally rich in vitamins A, E and F. It offers UV protection (it is SPF ~6) and provides the skin with essential fatty acids and the nutrients necessary for collagen production. Shea butter has been used in Africa and other countries for years to improve skin and hair. Mango Butter Mango Butter In skin care, we flock to mango butter for its moisturizing essential fatty acids. It's rich in oleic acid, a mono-unsaturated omega-9 acid; and stearic acid, a saturated fatty acid. These are ingredients that the skin readily recognizes, takes up, and uses to help add moisture to the skin, tighten and firm. Here are some of the other ways mango benefits skin: Because it's rich in vitamin C, mango butter can help encourage a more plump and tighter look. It also promotes a firmer appearance on skin. Natural source of vitamin A: Vitamin A is one of the natural ingredients that encourages a revitalized, glowing look. Since mango butter is a natural source of vitamin A, it helps reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and increasing skin's overall youthful look. Treats dry skin: Dry patches, flakiness, and even sensitive skin can benefit from daily application of mango butter, which goes to work deeply moisturizing. Oh, and don't forget your lips\u2014mango butter works great as a lip balm. Reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles: Mango butter provides a more lasting type of moisturization, which can help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles down the line. Cocoa Butter Cocoa Butter (sometimes called theobroma oil) is a natural oil extracted from the cocoa bean. Cocoa beans are native to parts of Central and South America and have been harvested to make natural skin moisturizers in places like Mesoamerica and the Caribbean for centuries. Cocoa butter makes an excellent skin moisturizer, plus it does more than just hydrate the skin \u2014 it helps actually heal it from the inside out too. It's a great source of natural antioxidants that are found in cocoa beans (the same kinds found in real, dark chocolate that are tied to benefits like heart health and improved cognitive functioning). Saturated fats are especially beneficial for healing dry, cracked skin because they're easily absorbed and remain on the skin for hours. Cocoa butter contains compounds called cocoa mass polyphenols, which some studies have found can help diminish signs of aging, plus soothe sensitive skin suffering from dermatitis or rashes. Avocado Oil Avocado Oil is produced from the fruit (avocado) of the avocado tree. Avocado oil is pressed from the fleshy pulp surrounding the avocado pit, making it one of the few edible oils not derived from seed. This pulp produces an oil full of healthy fats, including oleic acid and essential fatty acids. Avocado oil is high in a substance called sterolin, which studies have shown to facilitate the softening of the skin and to reduce the incidence of age spots. Avocado oil is rich in antioxidants, making it useful for healing sun-damaged skin. Antioxidants like vitamins A, D and E in avocado cause the skin to be suppler, and are thus particularly good for dry or aged skin. Argan Oil Argan Oil Inside that little fruit, is the little nut that gives us argan oil. For generations, natives of the Argan Forest in Morocco have pressed the nut to extract this precious oil, to use as a dietary supplement, for wound healing and rash relief, and to nourish skin and hair. These slow-growing trees are so revered that in 1998 the Argan Forest was declared a Biosphere Reserve By UNESCO. Argan oil use was not just isolated to Morocco.

Because of its antioxidant power, it slows the rate of skin damage experienced from UV light exposure, pollution and toxicity. Tea Tree Oil Historically tea tree plants' volatile essential oils (Melaleuca alternifolia) have been capitalized on most for their antiseptic and anti-inflammatory actions. The Melaleuca genus belongs to the Myrtaceae family and contains approximately 230 plant species, almost all of which are native to Australia. A 2006 report published by The School of Biomedical and Chemical Sciences at The University of Western Australia stated that tea tree's primary active ingredients responsible for its ability to reduce harmful bacteria include terpene hydrocarbons, monoterpenes plant of the ginger family (Zingiberaceae). The turmeric plant grows to a height of about three feet and has yellow flowers. The root is bright-orange with a thin brownish skin.
