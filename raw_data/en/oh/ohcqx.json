Including honey while breastfeeding is one such topic of discussion. Although babies who are less than a year old are not given honey directly as it might increase the chances of infant botulism, it is safe to be consumed by the mother. Honey contains high levels of fructosei [X]A sweetener naturally present in fruits, honey, and vegetables. and glucose, important for giving stamina to the breastfeeding mother. It is also known to be rich in antioxidantsi [X]Substances that may prevent or slow down some types of cell damage caused due to harmful molecules called free radicals. and antibacterial properties that help in strengthening the immune system. Read about the safety of having honey while breastfeeding, its benefits, and possible side effects. Is It Safe To Have Honey While Breastfeeding? Yes, a nursing mother can eat good quality pasteurizedi [X]The act of killing germs by heating a product to a specific temperature for a specified time. honey. However, it is good to avoid raw honey, which has high chances of containing spores of Clostridium botulinumi [X]A bacteria that creates toxic substances when exposed to low oxygen levels. which may adversely affect maternal health. Since the botulism spores are killed in the gastrointestinal tract of the mother, they would not enter into the bloodstream or make their way into the [breast milk](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/breast-milk-production-stages-of-preparing-your-breasts-for-feeding_0092504/). Moreover, the spores are too big to pass into the mother's milk and even the botulinum toxin does not pass into breast milk [(1)](http://www.infantbotulism.org/general/faq.php). Rest assured, breast milk is certainly not a source of the toxin or the bacterial spores causing infant botulism. Unlike adults, babies' immature [digestive system lacks](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/when-do-babies-digestive-systems-mature_00602132/) enough acidity in the stomach to kill botulism causing bacteria. If the baby happens to ingest raw honey containing botulism spores, they may colonize in his large intestine to produce botulinum neurotoxini [X]A muscle-paralyzing toxin that affects the nervous system. leading to infant botulism. While you cannot give honey directly to a baby less than 6 months of age, consumption during motherhood does not pose any risk to the infant. Precautions To Be Taken While Eating Honey During Breastfeeding If you are a nursing mother and have a habit of taking honey regularly, you may continue doing so, but follow these precautions: - Make it a practice to wash your hands thoroughly to rule out the chance of botulism spores possibly stuck on your hands and fingers, to avoid passing them on to the baby. - Check the manufacturing and expiry dates before you buy a bottle of honey. - Choose a good quality honey that is well-processed and pasteurized. - Consume in moderate amounts. - Discuss with your doctor regarding the honey types and the one that best suits your needs.
