[7500] CHIP Annual Report Template - FFY 2013 13 SECTION II: PROGRAM 'S PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT AND PROGRESS This section consists of three subsections that gat her information on about the CHIP and/or Medicaid program Section IIA captures data on the core set o f children's health care quality measures. Section IIB captures your enrollment progress as well as change s in the number and/or rate of uninsured children i n your State. Section IIC captures progress towards meeting your state's general strategic objectives a nd performance goals. SECTION IIA: REPORTING OF THE CORE SET OF CHILDREN 'S HEALTH CORE QUALITY MEASURES (C HILDREN 'S CORE SET ) Section 401(a) of the Children's Health Insurance P rogram Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA) (Pub.L. 111-3) required the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to identify an initial co re set of child health care quality measures for volun tary use by state programs administered under title s XIX and XXI, health insurance issuers and managed c are entities that enter into contract with such programs, and providers of items and services under such programs. CHIPRA also required the Secretary to publish changes to the core set measur es beginning in January 2013. Three measures (Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine for Female Adol escents, Behavioral Health Risk Assessment (for Pregnant Women, and Medication Management for Peopl e with Asthma) were added to the Children's Core Set in 2013 and one measure (Otitis Media with Effusion) was retired. Table 1 lists the Children' s Core Set measures, their measure stewards, and a ge neral description of each measure. Acronyms replaced measure numbers beginning in 2013. Additionally, Section 401(a)(4) required the develo pment of a standardized reporting format for states that volunteer to report on the core set of measures. Th is section of CARTS will be used for standardized reporting on the Children's Core Set measures. States that volunteer are required to report using the standardized methodologies and specifications a nd report on the populations to which the measures are applied. Below are the measure stewards and general description of the measures. Please referen ce the Technical Specifications and Resource Manual for the Initial Core Set of Children's Health Care Quality Measures for detailed information for standardized measure reporting.

In the first and s econd columns, data from the previous two years' an nual reports (FFY 2011 and FFY 2012) will be populated w ith data previously reported in CARTS; enter data i n these columns only if changes must be made. If you previously reported no data for either of those yea rs, but you now have recent data for them, please enter the data. In the third column, please report the m ost recent data available at the time you are submittin g the current annual report (FFY 2013). Additional instructions for completing each row of the table a re provided below. If Data Not Reported, Please Explain Why: Beginning in 2011, the CARTS application will requi re states to provide information on why they chose not to report a measure(s) in Section IIA. T he CARTS user will be prompted to provide this information for each measure during data entry. If the CARTS User skips these questions during the data entry process, he/she will be prompted to respond to them before being able to certify the Annual Report. If Data Not Reported, Please Explain Why: CHIP Annual Report Template - FFY 2013 18 If you cannot provide a specific measure, please ch eck the box that applies to your state for each measure as follows: Population not covered : Check this box if your program does not cover th e population included in the measure. Data not available : Check this box if data are not available for a p articular measure in your State. Please provide an explanation of why the data are c urrently not available. Small sample size : Check this box if the denominator size for a pa rticular measure is less than 30. If the denominator size is less than 30, your state is not required to report a rate on the measure. However, please indicate the exact denomi nator size in the space provided. Other : Please specify if there is another reason why yo ur state cannot report the measure. Although the Children's Core Set measures is volun tarily reported, if the state is not reporting data on a specific measure, it is important to provide the re asons why the state is not reporting the measure. I t is important for CMS to understand why each state and why all states as a group may not be reporting on specific measures. Your selection of a reason for n ot reporting and/or provision of an \"other\" reason for not reporting will assist CMS in that understanding . Status of Data Reported: Please indicate the status of the data you are repo rting, as follows: Provisional : Check this box if you are reporting data for a m easure, but the data are currently being modified, verified, or may change in any othe r way before you finalize them for the current CARTS reporting period. Explanation of Provisional Data - When the value of the Status of Data Reported fi eld is selected as \"Provisional\", the state must specif y why the data are provisional and when the state expects the data will be final. Final : Check this box if the data you are reporting are considered final for the current CARTS reporting period. Same data as reported in a previous year's annual report : Check this box if the data you are reporting are the same data that your state reporte d in another annual report. Indicate in which year's annual report you previously reported the da ta. Measurement Specification: For each measure, please indicate whether the measu re is based on HEDIS\u00ae technical specifications, the specifications developed by other measure stewa rds listed in the Technical Specifications and Resource Manual (e.g. CMS, CDC, AMA/PCPI), or \"other\" measurement specifications. If HEDIS\u00ae is selected, the HEDIS\u00ae Version field must be complete d. If \"Other\" measurement specification is selected, t he explanation field must be completed. States sh ould use the technical specifications outlined in the Te chnical Specifications and Resource Manual for the Children's Core Set measures. HEDIS\u00ae Version: Please specify HEDIS\u00ae Version (example HEDIS 2011, HEDIS 2012). This field must be completed only when a user selects the HEDIS\u00ae measurement specific ation. \"Other\" Measurement Specification Explanation: If \"Other,\" measurement specification is selected, please complete the explanation of the \"Other\" measurement specification. The explanation field m ust be completed when \"Other\" measurement specification has been selected, Data Source: CHIP Annual Report Template - FFY 2013 19 For each measure, please indicate the methodology a nd data source used to calculate the measure - administrative method (e.g., using claims or encoun ter data); hybrid method (e.g., combining administrative data and medical records); survey da ta (specify the survey used); or other source (spec ify the other source). Definition of Population Included in the Measure: Numerator : Please indicate the definition of the population included in the numerator for each measure. Denominator : Please indicate the definition of the population included in the denominator for each measure by checking one box to indicate whether the data are for the CHIP population only (Title XXI), the Medicaid population only (Title XIX), or includ e both CHIP and Medicaid children combined. If the denominator reported is not fully representa tive of the population defined above (the CHIP population only, the Medicaid population only, or t he CHIP and Medicaid populations combined), please further define the denominator, including those who are excluded from the denominator. For example, please note if the denominator excludes children en rolled in managed care in certain counties or certa in plans or if it excludes children in fee-for-service or PCCM. Also, please report the number of childr en excluded. The provision of this information is impo rtant and will provide CMS with a context so that comparability of denominators can be assessed acros s the states and over time. Deviation from the Measure Technical Specification If the data provided for a measure deviates from th e measure technical specification, please select th e type(s) of measure specification deviation. The typ es of deviation parallel the measure specification categories for each measure. Each type of deviation is accompanied by a comment field that States must use to explain in greater detail or further specify the deviation when a deviation(s) from a measure i s selected. The five types (and examples) of deviations are: 1. Year of Data (e.g., partial year), 2. Data Source (e.g., use of different data sources among health plans or delivery systems), 3. Numerator (e.g., coding issues), 4. Denominator (e.g., exclusion of MCOs, different age groups, definition of continuous enrollment), 5. Other (please describe in detail). When one or more of the types of deviations are sel ected, States are required to provide an explanatio n. Year of Data: not available for the 2013 CARTS repo rting period. Please report the year of data for each measure. T he year (or months) should correspond to the period in which utilization took place . Do not report the year in which data were collected for t he measure, or the version of HEDIS\u00ae used to calculate the measure, bo th of which may be different from the period corresponding to utilization of services.

Children's Core Set Measurement Data In this section, please report the numerators and d enominators for each measure (or component). The template provides two sections for entering the dat a, depending on whether you are reporting using HEDIS\u00ae or other methodologies. The form fields hav e been set up to facilitate entering numerators and denominators for each measure. If the form fields do not give you enough space to fully report on the measure, please use the \"additional notes\" section. CHIP Annual Report Template - FFY 2013 20 The reporting unit for each measure is the state as a whole. If states calculate rates for multiple r eporting units (e.g., individual health plans, different hea lth care delivery systems), states must aggregate data from all these sources into one state-level rate be fore reporting the data to CMS. In the situation w here a state combines data across multiple reporting units , all or some of which use the hybrid method to calculate the rates, the state should enter zeroes in the \"Numerator\" and \"Denominator\" fields. In th ese cases, it should report the state-level rate in the \"Rate\" field and, when possible, include individu al reporting unit numerators, denominators, and rates in the field labeled \"Additional Notes on Measure,\" along with a description of the method used to deri ve the state-level rate. For additional guidance on developing a state-level rate, please refer to the Technical Assistance Brief \"Approaches to Developin g State-Level Rates for Children's Health Care Qualit y Measures Based on Data from Multiple Sources,\" available at: http://medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-Informati on/By-Topics/Quality-of- Care/Downloads/TA2-StateRates.pdf . Beginning in 2012, in an effort to reduce state bur den of reporting on the Children's Core Set measures, CMS will calculate measures PDENT (Preven tive Dental Services) and TDENT (Dental Treatment Services) for states based on data submit ted as part of the EPSDT report (Form CMS- 416), and measure CLABSI (Pediatric Central Line As sociated Blood Stream Infections) based on data submitted by states to the National Healthcare Safety Network database. Clarification About Implementing the CHIPRA CAHPS R equirement Under 402(a)(2), which amends reporting requirements in section 2108 of the Social Security Act, requires Title XXI Programs (i.e., CHIP Medicaid expansion programs, separate child health programs, or a comb ination of the two) to report CAHPS results to CMS starting December 2013. While Title XXI Pro grams may select any CAHPS Child Medicaid survey to fulfill this requirement, CMS en courages these programs to use the CAHPS Health Plan Survey 5.0H Child Questionnaire with or without the Supplemental Questions Items for Children with Chronic Conditions to align with the CAHPS Initial Core Set Measure. Starting in 2013, Title XXI Programs should submit summary l evel information from the CAHPS survey to CMS via the CARTS attachment facility. We also enc ourage states to submit raw data to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's CAHPS Database. More information is available in the Technical Assistance fact sheet, Collecting and Reporting the CAHPS Survey as Required Under the CHIPRA: http://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-Infor Title XIX Programs: survey, remains voluntary for Title XIX Programs. Title XIX Programs should submit summary level info rmation from the CAHPS survey to CMS via the CARTS attachment facility. We also encourage s tates to submit raw data to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's CAHPS Database. If a state would like to provide data on both Medic aid and CHIP enrollees, the agency must sample Titl e XIX (Medicaid) and Title XXI (CHIP) programs separa tely and submit separate results to CMS to fulfill the CHIPRA Requirement. CHIPRA Quality Demonstration States CHIPRA Quality Demonstration states have the option of reporting state developed quality measures through CARTS. Instructions may be found on page 2 7 in the web-based template and after core measure MMA (Medication Management for People with Asthma) on the Word template.

(Provide a numerical ra nge or confidence intervals if available.) [7500] 3. What are the limitations of the data or estimati on methodology? [7500] 4. How does your state use this alternate data sour ce in CHIP program planning? [7500] How many children do you estimate have been enroll ed in Medicaid as a result of CHIP outreach activities and enrollment simplification? Describe the data source and method used to derive this information [7500] It is difficult to estimate the number of children enrolled in Medicaid due to CHIP outreach. Families are encouraged to submit an application if they have uninsured children. Upon processing the application, the children are enrolled in the p rogram (ALL Kids or Medicaid) for which they are eligible. In FY 2013, CHIP referred 63,989 children to Medica id through the joint web application and the Automated Data Integration system. CHIP Annual Report Template - FFY 2013 92 SECTION IIC: STATE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND PERFORMANCE GOALS This subsection gathers information on your state's general strategic objectives, performance goals, performance measures and progress towards meeting g oals, as specified in your CHIP state plan. (If you r goals reported in the annual report now differ from Section 9 of your CHIP state plan, please indicate how they differ in \"Other Comments on Measure.\" Also, t he state plan should be amended to reconcile these differences). The format of this section provides y our state with an opportunity to track progress ove r time. This section contains templates for reporting perfo rmance measurement data for each of five categories of strategic objectives, related to: Reducing the number of uninsured children CHIP enrollment Medicaid enrollment Increasing access to care Use of preventative care (immunizations, well chil d care) Please report performance measurement data for the three most recent years for which data are available (to the extent that data are available). In the first two columns, data from the previous t wo years' annual reports (FFY 2011 and FFY 2012) will be populated with data from previously reported dat a in CARTS. If you previously reported data in the 2 previous years reports (2011 and/or 2012) and you want to update/change the data, please enter that d ata. If you previously reported no data for either of those years, but you now have recent data available for them, please enter the data. In the third col umn, please report the most recent data available at the time you are submitting the current annual report (FFY 2013). Note that the term performance measure is used diff erently in Section IIA versus IIC. In Section IIA, the term refers to the 24 core child health measures. In this section, the term is used more broadly, to refer to any data your state provides as evidence towards a particular goal within a strategic objective. For the purpose of this section, \"objectives\" refer to the five broad categories listed above, while \"goals\" a re state- specific, and should be listed in the appropriate s ubsections within the space provided for each objec tive. NOTES: Please do not reference attachments in this section. If details about a particular measure are located in an attachment, please summarize the relevant information from the attachment in the space provided for each measure. In addition, please do not report the same data tha t were reported in Sections IIA or IIB. The intent of this section is to capture goals and measures th at your state did not report elsewhere in Section II. Additional instructions for completing each row of the table are provided below. Goal: For each objective, space has been provided to repo rt up to three goals. Use this section to provide a brief description of each goal you are reporting wi thin a given strategic objective. All new goals should include a direction and a target. For clarification only, an example goal would be : \"Increase (direction) by 5 percent (target) the number of CHI P beneficiaries who turned 13 years old during the measurement year who had a second dose of MMR, thre e hepatitis B vaccinations and one varicella vaccination by their 13 th birthday.\" Type of Goal: For each goal you are reporting within a given stra tegic objective, please indicate the type of goal, as follows: New/revised: Check this box if you have revised or added a goal . Please explain how and why the goal was revised. CHIP Annual Report Template - FFY 2013 93 Continuing: Check this box if the goal you are reporting is th e same one you have reported in previous annual reports. Discontinued: Check this box if you have met your goal and/or ar e discontinuing a goal. Please explain why the goal was discontinued. Status of Data Reported: Please indicate the status of the data you are repo rting for each goal, as follows: Provisional : Check this box if you are reporting performance me asure data for a goal, but the data are currently being modified, verified, or may change in any other way before you finalize them for FFY 2013. Explanation of Provisional Data - When the value of the Status of Data Reported f ield is selected as \"Provisional\", the state must specify w hy the data are provisional and when the state expects the data will be final. Final : Check this box if the data you are reporting are c onsidered final for FFY 2013. Same data as reported in a previous year's annual r eport : Check this box if the data you are reporting are the same data that your state rep orted for the goal in another annual report. Indicate in which year's annual report you previous ly reported the data. Measurement Specification: This section is included for only two of the object ives\u2014 objectives related to increasing access to ca re, and objectives related to use of preventative care\u2014 because these are the two objectives for which stat es may report using the HEDIS\u00ae measurement specificati on. In this section, for each goal, please indicat e the measurement specification used to calculate you r performance measure data (i.e., were the measures calculated using the HEDIS\u00ae specifications or some other method unrelated to HEDIS\u00ae). Please indicate whether the measure is based on HED IS\u00ae technical specifications or another source. I f HEDIS\u00ae is selected, the HEDIS\u00ae Version field must b e completed. If \"Other\" measurement specification is selected, the explanation field must be complete d. HEDIS\u00ae Version: Please specify HEDIS\u00ae Version (example 2011, 2012). This field must be completed only when a user select the HEDIS\u00ae measurement specification. \"Other\" measurement specification explanation: If \"Other\", measurement specification is selected, please complete the explanation of the \"Other\" measurement specification. The explanation field m ust be completed when \"Other\" measurement specification has been selected, Data Source: For each performance measure, please indicate the s ource of data. The categories provided in this section vary by objective. For the objectives rela ted to reducing the number of uninsured children an d CHIP or Medicaid enrollment, please indicate whethe r you have used eligibility/enrollment data, survey data (specify the survey used), or other source (sp ecify the other source). For the objectives relate d to access to care and use of preventative care, please indicate whether you used administrative data (claims) (specify the kind of administrative data u sed), hybrid data (claims and medical records) (spe cify how the two were used to create the data source), s urvey data (specify the survey used), or other sour ce (specify the other source). In all cases, if anoth er data source was used, please explain the source. Definition of Population Included in Measure: CHIP Annual Report Template - FFY 2013 94 Numerator: Please indicate the definition of the po pulation included in the numerator for each measure (such as the number of visits required for inclusio n, e.g., one or more visits in the past year). Denominator: Please indicate the definition of the population included in the denominator for each measure For measures related to increasing access to care a nd use of preventative care, please check one box to indicate whether the data are for the CHIP population only, or include both CHIP and Medicaid (Title XIX) children combined. check one box to indicate whether the data are for the CHIP population only, or include both CHIP and Medicaid (Title XIX) children combined. 1. If the denominator reported is not fully represe ntative of the population defined above (the CHIP population only, or the CHIP and Medicaid (Title XIX) populations combi ned), please further define the denominator. For example, denominator includes only children enrolled in managed care in certain counties, technological limitations prevent ing reporting on the full population defined, etc.) . Please report information on exclusions in the defi nition of the denominator (including the proportion of children excluded), The provision of this inform ation is important and will provide CMS with a context so that comparability of denominators acros s the states and over time can occur. Deviations from Measure For the measures related to increasing access to ca re and use of preventative care. If the data provided for a measure deviates from th e measure specification, please select the type(s) of measure specification deviation. The typ es of deviation parallel the measure specification categories for each measure. Each typ e of deviation is accompanied by a comment field that states must use to explain in greater de tail or further specify the deviation when a deviation(s) from a measure is selected.. The five types (and examples) of deviations are: 2. Year of Data (e.g., partial year), 3. Data Source (e.g., use of different data sources among health plans or delivery systems), 4. Numerator (e.g., coding issues), 5. Denominator (e.g., exclusion of MCOs, different age groups, definition of continuous enrollment), 6. Other. When one or more of the types are selected, states are required to provide an explanation. Please report the year of data for each performance measure. The year (or months) should correspond to the period in which enrollment or utilization took plac e . Do not report the year in which data were collected for the measure, or the version of HEDIS\u00ae used to calculate the measure, both of which may b e different from the period corresponding to enrollme nt or utilization of services. Date Range: available for 2013 CARTS reporting peri od. Please define the date range for the reporting peri od based on the \"From\" time period as the month an d year which corresponds to the beginning period in w hich utilization took place and please report the \" To\" time period as the month and year which corresponds to the end period in which utilization took place. Do not report the year in which data were collected for t he measure, or the version of HEDIS\u00ae used to calculate the measure, both of which may be differe nt from the period corresponding to utilization of services. Performance Measurement Data (HEDIS\u00ae or Other): In this section, please report the numerators and d enominators, rates for each measure (or component). The template provides two sections for entering the performance measurement data, depending on whether you are reporting using HEDIS\u00ae or other met hodologies. The form fields have been set up to facilitate entering numerators and denominators for each measure. If the form fields do not give you enough space to fully report on the measure, please use the \"additional notes\" section. CHIP Annual Report Template - FFY 2013 95 The preferred method is to calculate a \"weighted ra te\" by summing the numerators and denominators across plans, and then deriving a single state-leve l rate based on the ratio of the numerator to the denominator). The reporting unit for each measure is the state as a whole. If states calculate rates for multiple reporting units (e.g., individual health p lans, different health care delivery systems), Stat es must aggregate data from all these sources into one Stat e rate before reporting the data to CMS. In the situation where a state combines data across multip le reporting units, all or some of which use the hy brid method to calculate the rates, the state should ent er zeroes in the \"Numerator\" and \"Denominator\" fiel ds. In these cases, it should report the state-level ra te in the \"Rate\" field and, when possible, include individual reporting unit numerators, denominators, and rates in the field labeled \"Additional Notes o n Measure,\" along with a description of the method us ed to derive the state-level rate. Explanation of Progress: The intent of this section is to allow your state t o highlight progress and describe any quality-impro vement activities that may have contributed to your progre ss. Any quality-improvement activity described sho uld involve the CHIP program, benefit CHIP enrollees, a nd relate to the performance measure and your progress. An example of a quality-improvement acti vity is a state-wide initiative to inform individua l families directly of their children's immunization status with the goal of increasing immunization rat es. CHIP would either be the primary lead or substantia lly involved in the project. If improvement has not occurred over time, this section can be used to dis cuss potential reasons for why progress was not see n and to describe future quality-improvement plans. In this section, your state is also asked to set an nual performance objectives for FFY 2014, 2015 and 2016. Based on your recent performance on the measure (from FFY 2011 through 2013), use a combina tion of expert opinion and \"best guesses\" to set objectives for the next three years. Please explai n your rationale for setting these objectives. For example, if your rate has been increasing by 3 or 4 percentage points per year, you might project futu re increases at a similar rate. On the other hand, if your rate has been stable over time, you might set a target that projects a small increase over time. I f the rate has been fluctuating over time, you migh t look more closely at the data to ensure that the fluctua tions are not an artifact of the data or the method s used to construct a rate. You might set an initial targ et that is an average of the recent rates, with sli ght increases in subsequent years. In future annual rep orts, you will be asked to comment on how your actu al performance compares to the objective your state se t for the year, as well as any quality-improvement activities that have helped or could help your stat e meet future objectives. Other Comments on Measure: Please use this section to provide any other commen ts on the measure, such as data limitations, plans to report on a measure in the future, or differences b etween performance measures reported here and those discussed in Section 9 of the CHIP state plan.

What other strategies does your state use to me asure and report on access to, quality, or outcomes of care received by your CHIP population? What have y ou found? [7500] ALL Kids receives pediatric HEDIS measures from Blu e Cross Blue Shield of Alabama (BCBSAL), its sole health plan administrator. Additionally, BCBSAL co nducts a customer service satisfaction survey. BCBSAL surveys consistently report a very high perc entage of enrollees as either satisfied or very satisfied with the availability of physicians, spec ialty care physicians, and hospital care. 2. What strategies does your CHIP program have for future measurement and reporting on access to, quality, or outcomes of care received by your CHIP population? When will data be available? [7500] ALL Kids will continue to implement the Consumer As sessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems, Child Medicaid Questionnaire which includes questio ns for children with chronic conditions along with selections from among the supplemental items for th e Child Questionnaire. ALL Kids will submit CAHPS data to the National CAHPS Benchmarking Database an nually as possible. 3. Have you conducted any focused quality studies on your CHIP population, e.g., adolescents, attenti on deficit disorder, substance abuse, special heath ca re needs or other emerging health care needs? What have you found? [7500] ALL Kids has contracted with the University of Alab ama at Birmingham (UAB) for quality studies. Multi ple studies are in the design and implementation proces s. Several studies are in the submission and revie w process. A study entitled, \"Are Preventive Dental Visits Eff ective in Reducing Non-Preventive Dental Services & Expenditures?\", was published in Pediatrics which e xamined the impact preventive services have upon subsequent nonpreventive visits and overall program costs. The results of this study found that more preventiv e visits were associated with fewer subsequent nonpreventive dental visits and lower nonpreventive dental expenditures for both groups. However, mor e preventive visits did not reduce overall dental or medical (inclusive dental) expenditures. 4. Please attach any additional studies, analyses or other documents addressing outreach, enrollment, access, quality, utilization, costs, satisfaction, or other aspects of your CHIP program's performance . Please include any analyses or descriptions of any efforts designed to reduce the number of uncovered children in the state through a state health insura nce connector program or support for innovative pri vate health coverage initiatives health coverage initiat ives. [7500] Other quality studies with the UAB include: identi fying drivers of health expenditures, utilization a nd re- enrollment among the 200-300%FPL expansion, churnin g of enrollees between ALL Kids and Alabama Medicaid, and the impact of the recession upon enro llment and expenditures for ALL Kids and Alabama Medicaid.

N/A CHIP Annual Report Template - FFY 2013 132 SECTION III: ASSESSMENT OF STATE PLAN AND PROGRAM OPERATION Please reference and summarize attachments that are relevant to specific questions A. OUTREACH 1. How have you redirected/changed your outreach st rategies during the reporting period? [7500] No changes were made in outreach during FY 2013. T he ALL Kids program continues to distribute applications and program materials. 2. What methods have you found most effective in re aching low-income, uninsured children (e.g., T.V., school outreach, word-of-mouth)? How have you measu red effectiveness? [7500] Many families learn of the program through word-of- mouth. In addition, many community partners and agencies educate families about ALL Kids and Me dicaid. Community partners continue to serve as a great resource in reaching low-income and unin sured children in the state. 3. Which of the methods described in Question 2 wou ld you consider a best practice(s) ? [7500] When surveying families on how they first heard abo ut ALL Kids, word-of-mouth is the most common response. With so many human service agencies, sch ools, providers and community based organizations aware of the program, these groups ar e able to make families aware of the program and assist with connecting families to the applicat ion process. 4. Is your state targeting outreach to specific pop ulations (e.g., minorities, immigrants, and childre n living in rural areas)? Yes No Have these efforts been successful, and how have yo u measured effectiveness? [7500] 5. What percentage of children below 200 percent of the Federal poverty level (FPL) who are eligible f or Medicaid or CHIP have been enrolled in those progra ms? [5] 83.7 (Identify the data source used). [7500] Current Population Survey (3-year average, coverage years 2010-2012). This figure may be limited by undercounts among children covered by Medicaid/C HIP. B. SUBSTITUTION OF COVERAGE (C ROWD -OUT ) All states should answer the following questions. Please include percent calculations in your responses when applicable and requested. 1. Do you have substitution prevention policies in place? Yes No If yes, indicate if you have the following policie s: Imposing waiting periods between terminating priva te coverage and enrolling in CHIP Imposing cost sharing in approximation to the cost of private coverage Monitoring health insurance status at the time of application Other, please explain [7500] CHIP Annual Report Template - FFY 2013 133 a. Describe how substitution of coverage is monitor ed and measured and how the State evaluates the effectiveness of its policies. [7500] ALL Kids application materials require that the par ent provide detailed information on current health insurance coverage for children and explain any cov erage that has ended in the previous three months. This information is captured in the CHIP Eligibilit y System and is reviewed at initial eligibility det ermination and renewal. This is to ensure that children ineli gible for ALL Kids are not enrolled due to having o r recently voluntarily terminating other health insur ance. If a child appears eligible for ALL Kids, an d is uninsured or meets one of the criteria for exceptio n to the ALL Kids crowd-out policy, the information is transmitted to the insurance vendor for enrollment in the program. This nightly enrollment transmitta l to BCBSAL is then matched against other BCBSAL policie s in order to identify children with other BCBSAL coverage in effect or that has been terminated less than 90 days from the date of enrollment indicated on the file. This is a highly effective strategy beca use BCBSAL is the largest private insurer in the st ate. A system generated report is returned from BCBSAL dai ly to ALL Kids indicating those potential enrollees matched as insured. Each case is investigated and the family notified of the indicated other coverage and appropriate waiting periods for enrollment. If enrollment in other insurance is dropped voluntari ly, there is a 3 month waiting period (during which the child must be uninsured under group coverage) befo re the child can be enrolled in ALL Kids. Exceptions to this waiting period are made for children who ha ve had group health insurance involuntarily terminated , an individual policy terminated, had a COBRA poli cy terminated, and/or exhausted their lifetime benefit s under their other policy. b. Identify the trigger mechanism or point at which your substitution prevention policy is instituted or modified if you currently have a substitution polic y. [7500] If enrollment in other insurance is dropped volunta rily, there is a 3 month waiting period (during whi ch the child must be uninsured under group coverage) b efore the child can be enrolled in ALL Kids. Exceptions to this waiting period are made for chil dren who have had group health insurance involuntarily terminated, an individual policy term inated, had a COBRA policy terminated, and/or exhausted their lifetime benefits under their other policy. All states must complete the following questions c. At the time of application, what percent of CHIP applicants are found to have Medicaid [(# applican ts found to have Medicaid/total # applicants) * 100] [5] 10.95 and what percent of applicants are found to have ot her group insurance [(# applicants found to have other insurance/total # applicants) * 100] [5] ? 6.07 Provide a combined percent if you cannot calculate separate percentages. [5] d. What percent of CHIP applicants cannot be enroll ed because they have group health plan coverage [5] 4.34 a. Of those found to have had other, private insura nce and have been uninsured for only a portion of the state's waiting period, what percent meet yo ur state's exemptions to the waiting period (if your state has a waiting period and exemptions) [(# applicants who are exempt/total # of new applicants who were enrolled)*100]? [5] e. Does your state have an affordability exception to its waiting period? Yes No If yes, please respond to the following questions. I f no, skip to question 7 . a. Has the state established a specific threshold f or defining affordability (e.g., when the cost of the child's portion of the family's employe r-based health insurance premium is more than X percent of family income)? CHIP Annual Report Template - FFY 2013 134 Yes No If the state has established a specific threshold, please provide this figure and whether this applies to net or gross income. If no, how do es the state determine who meets the affordability exception? [7500] b. What expenses are counted for purposes of determ ining when the family exceeds the affordability threshold? (e.g., Does the state cons ider only premiums, or premiums and other cost-sharing charges? Does the state base th e calculation on the total premium for family coverage under the employer plan or on the d ifference between the amount of the premium for employee-only coverage and the amount o f the premium for family coverage? Other approach?) [7500] c. What percentage of enrollees at initial applicat ion qualified for this exception in the last federal fiscal year? (e.g., Number of applicants w ho were exempted because of affordability exception/total number of applicants who were enrolled). [5] d. Does the state conduct surveys or focus groups t hat examine whether affordability is a concern? Yes No If yes, please provide relevant findings. [7500] 7. If your state does not have an affordability ex ception, does your State collect data on the cost of health insurance for an individual or family? [7500] No 8. Does the state's CHIP application ask whether ap plicants have access to private health insurance? Yes No If yes, do you track the number of individuals who have access to private insurance? Yes No If yes, what percent of individuals that enrolled i n CHIP had access to private health insurance at the time of application during the last federal fis cal year [(# of individuals that had access to private health insurance/total # of individuals enr olled in CHIP)*100]? [5] C. ELIGIBILITY (This subsection should be completed by all states) Medicaid Expansion states should complete applicabl e responses and indicate those questions that are n on- applicable with N/A. CHIP Annual Report Template - FFY 2013 135 Section IIIC: Subpart A: Overall CHIP and Medicai d Eligibility Coordination 1. Does the state use a joint application for estab lishing eligibility for Medicaid or CHIP? Yes No If no, please describe the screen and enroll proces s. [7500] 2. Please explain the process that occurs when a ch ild's eligibility status changes from Medicaid to CHIP and from CHIP to Medicaid. Have you identifie d any challenges? If so, please explain. [7500] Upon receipt of the enrollees' renewal application, all renewal information is entered into the respective system's data base. If a child is deter mined to be ineligible for his current program (ALL Kids or Medicaid) and probably eligible for th e other program (ALL Kids or Medicaid), the application information is sent electronically, thr ough the Automated Data Integration (ADI) system, to the other program along with all denial documentation. This is explained to the family. Upon receipt of the paper application from the orig inating program, the new program pulls the renewal information from the ADI system and process es the information as a new application. At the time of eligibility review, ALL Kids individual ly verifies whether or not an applicant is currentl y on Medicaid. Both Medicaid and ALL Kids also condu ct regular data bounces against each other's current enrollment files. When a child ha s been enrolled in Medicaid during his ALL Kids coverage period, ALL Kids coverage is terminated. Periodic ALL Kids/Medicaid meetings have identified a few minor problems and most have been successfully resolved. Such issues have included miscommunications, individual district cas eworker problems, inconsistent interpretations, clarifying what the other program needed in the way of documentation, paperwork, etc. A continuing issue involves ALL Kids enrollees who ar e approved for SSI and receive Medicaid during their ALL Kids enrollment period; thereby, r esulting in dual enrollment. In most cases SSI is approved retroactively. Retroactive coverage ma y be for just a few months or possibly as much as several years, making it impossible to proa ctively account for the dual enrollments that occur. 3. Are the same delivery systems (such as managed c are or fee for service,) or provider networks used in Medicaid and CHIP? [7500] Yes No If no, please explain. [7500] Medicaid uses a unique provider network which the M edicaid Agency manages. ALL Kids uses a preferred provider, discounted fee-for-service netw ork developed and managed by BCBSAL. 4. Do you have authority in your CHIP state plan to provide for presumptive eligibility, and have you implemented this? Yes No If yes a. What percent of children are presumptively enrol led in CHIP pending a full eligibility determination? [5] b. Of those children who are presumptively enrolled , what percent of those children are determined eligible and enrolled upon completion of the full eligibility determination those children are determined eligible and enrolled?

What additional measures, besides those described in Tables B1 or C1, does your state employ to simplify an eligibility renewal and retai n eligible children in CHIP? Conducts follow-up with clients through caseworkers /outreach workers Sends renewal reminder notices to all families i. How many notices are sent to the family prior to disenrolling the child from the program? [500] Families receive a renewal packet as well as one re minder letter. ii. At what intervals are reminder notices sent to fam ilies (e.g., how many weeks before the end of the current eligibility period is a follow-up lette r sent if the renewal has not been received by the state?) [500] Families receive a renewal packet two months prior to the date of renewal as well as one reminder letter 30 days prior to the renewal date. Other, please explain : [500] To assist families further, ALL Kids offers the opt ion to pay annual premiums in installments. Addtionally, families may use a credit or debit car d either on-line or by phone to pay premiums. Families who owe premiums receive an invoice every 3 months. Families may also renew by telephone. b. Which of the above strategies appear to be the mos t effective? Have you evaluated the effectiveness of any strategies? If so, please des cribe the evaluation, including data sources and methodology. [7500] Offering families the option to pay premiums on-lin e or by phone appears to be an effective strategy. The volume of premium payments by credit/debit card has increased from 8% in 2006 to 39% in FY 2013. While all of the above strategies assist fam ilies with renewal, ALL Kids has not conducted an evaluation to determine which strategy is the most effective.

Duration Measure of Selected Children, A ges 0-16, Enrolled in Title XXI, Second Quarter FFY 2012 The purpose of this table is to measure title XXI e nrollees' duration, or continuity, of public covera ge (title XIX and title XXI). This information is required by CHIPRA, Section 402(a). Reporting is required in 2013, with states identif ying newly enrolled children in the second quarter of FFY 2012 (January, February, and March of 2012). If your eligibility system already has the capability to tr ack a cohort of enrollees over time, an additional \"flag\" or unique identifier may not be necessary. NOTE: A new cohort identifying newly enrolled child ren will be required for all states in the second q uarter of FFY 2014 (January, February, and March of 2014) for the purpose of measuring duration of public coverage (t itle XIX and title XXI), similar to the measurement of the first 2012 cohort. Instructions: For this prospective duration measure, please iden tify newly enrolled children in title XXI in the second quarter of FFY 2012, ages 0 months to 16 years at time of enrollment. Children enrolled in January 2012 mu st have birthdates after July 1995 (e.g., children must be younger than 16 years and 5 months) to ensu re that they will not age out of the program at the 18 th month of coverage. Similarly, children enrolled i n February 2012 must have birthdates after August 1 995, and children enrolled in March 2012 must have birthdates after September 199 5. Each child newly enrolled during this time fram e needs a unique identifier or \"flag\" so that the c ohort can be tracked over time. If your eligibility system alre ady has the capability to track a cohort of enrolle es over time, an additional \"flag\" or unique identi fier may not be necessary. Please follow the child based on the ch ild's age category at the time of enrollment (e.g., the child's age at enrollment creates an age cohor t that does not change over the 18 month time span). Please enter the data requested in the table below and the temp late will tabulate the percentages. Only enter a \"0\" (zero) if the data are known to be zero. If data are unknown or u navailable, leave the field blank.

For those states that reported this measure in 2012, no change in reporting shoul d be necessary if the data represented six months o f coverage. The deniPgJR9on of \"12 months\" has been claried in the FFY 2013 CARTS to be consistent with the intend ed meaning of twelve calendar months of coverage (r ather than thirteen months of coverage). The definition is bas ed on an assumption that most states enroll childre n in a health plan on the first of the month. Howev er, regardless of the date of enrollment, the principle remains to me asure a full twelve-month period of coverage. The deniPgJR9on of \"18 months\" has been claried in the FFY 2013 CARTS to be consistent with the intend ed meaning of eighteen calendar months of coverage (rather than nineteen months of coverage).

Written complaints of fraud and abuse in the applic ant enrollment process are addressed on a case by case basis, as these occur very infrequentl y and usually each case has its own unique circumstances. When a case is referred to ALL Kids, the complaint is received and the initial, internal research on the applicant or enrollee is c onducted by the ALL Kids Program Integrity Unit. This research is conducted within a ten busin ess day time period. Some suspected fraud and abuse cases are subject to a committee type rev iew by the Director of Program Integrity, Director of Program Operations and Professional Ser vices Division, Director of Program Services, and/or the Director of the Eligibility Unit. The o ffice of ADPH General Counsel is involved as needed. There are several general steps which are relevant to each case investigated: 1. Conduct research in the CHIP Eligibility System to determine eligibility standards to enroll the applicant/enrollee. 2. Review the most current application on file. 3. Review the MSIQ Medicaid database for any applic able information. 4. Complete a summary of events to include complete names and dates. 5. Maintain a file of written complaints received b y fiscal year. Do managed health care plans with which your progra m contracts have written plans?

Please explain : [7500] Written complaints of fraud and abuse in the applic ant enrollment process are addressed by the ALL Kids Program Integrity Unit. However, for the prov ider sector, ALL Kids contracts with BCBSAL, its sole health plan administrator, to prevent fraud an d abuse, and investigate cases of suspected fraud and abuse. Monthly meetings are held with the contr actor where issues are discussed. Anti-Fraud Plan Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama has an active anti-fraud and abuse program to ensure the integrity of benefit administration. The mission o f the Network Integrity (NI) and Healthcare Analysi s Unit is to develop and continuously improve upon a comprehensive anti-fraud function, which will focus on the prevention, detection, investigation a nd resolution of fraud and abuse. Our objectives include: Proactive prevention through education and continuous improvement of strategic corporate defenses; Proactive detection through continual anal ysis and networking relationships; Quality investigation through well trained staff and internal/ external partnerships; Satisfactory resolution through education, recovery, and support of prosecution of fraud. Organizational Structure The Network Integrity and Healthcare Analytics Unit of the Health Management division has the primary responsibility for the detection, investigation, re covery of overpayments and referral for potential prosecution of cases involving unlawful or abusive activity directed against corporate and customer assets. The manager of the Network Integrity unit reports up through the Health Management division. The unit is staffed with a direct manager , investigators, clinical auditors, data analysts a nd research support staff who represent a variety of p rofessional backgrounds pertinent to the delivery and administration of health care. Recently, the NI unit implemented a new case management documentation software called iSight, to improve co nsistency and efficiency of our processes. Scope of Activities CHIP Annual Report Template - FFY 2013 154 The NI department is responsible for fraud and abus e activity involving providers, employer groups, an d subscribers. (Employee fraud is addressed through the Compliance department with the assistance of Internal Audit when needed) Investigative activi ties may be on a local, state, national or international level. The NI unit works collaborativ ely with all areas of the company in support of its investigation activities as well as employer groups , subscribers, providers, and investigative and judicial agencies (i.e. F.B.I., sheriff's office, A ttorney General, U.S. Attorney, District Attorney, OIG). The unit also works with professional regulatory ag encies and societies such as Medical Associations, Dental Examiners, Psychology Board, C hiropractic Board, Physical Therapy Board and the Pharmacy Board. Summary of Procedures Prevention Corporately, fraud and abuse prevention is accompli shed through a variety of means and in a variety of departments. These include maintenance of numerous claim edits and review procedures, construction of contractual provisions in our parti cipating provider networks aimed at ensuring appropriate care delivery and billing, the creation and maintenance of medical policies and directives , maintaining an active program of corporate anti-fra ud training and awareness campaigns, consumer / provider education, proactive data analysis, and co rporate participation in national anti-fraud organizations and initiatives as well as regulatory agency/law enforcement workgroups. Detection Investigative leads are generated through extensive routine and specific data mining, receipt of inter nal and external referrals, monitoring current events a nd publications, and national initiatives generated through national anti-fraud organizations such as N ational Healthcare Antifraud Association (NHCAA) and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. Blue C ross maintains 24 x 7 fraud referral hotline and referral capability via the Blue Cross website. An internal reward program is also in place to encourage associate referrals. The unit also utiliz es antifraud data detection methods dedicated to supporting antifraud investigations. A sophisticat ed provider scoring tool is used quarterly to quick ly identify changes in behavior that may need further investigation. Investigation Cases are assigned to unit representatives and inve stigated utilizing appropriate resources and method s. These may include medical record reviews; onsite au dits; interviews, law enforcement and regulatory agency collaboration; and consultation and review b y subject matter experts (peer reviewers.) Results of the investigations lead to identifying o ffenders and implementing corrective action plans. Corrective Action Corrective actions can include education, refund re covery, placement of preventative claim edits, termination from participation in plan networks, te rmination of group/ subscriber benefits, referral t o regulatory agencies for sanctions (i.e. Board of Me dical Examiners, Pharmacy Board, etc.) and/or prosecution depending on the circumstances of the c ase. Once corrective action has been implemented the sit uation is scheduled for follow-up analysis to valid ate the effectiveness of the measures. If the circumst ance addressed has not been corrected the Network Integrity Unit works to ensure that the sit uation is finally resolved satisfactorily. In addition to resolving each specific case of frau d and/or abuse, overall benefit utilization is moni tored through data analysis to identify exceptional areas of medical care and to validate appropriate claim processing. Exceptions are further investigated to determine if the variance is due to unethical practice, justifiable patient medical conditions or other internal claim processing issues. Even when CHIP Annual Report Template - FFY 2013 155 fraud is not provable or evident, corporate practic es may be affected. 6. Do you contract with managed care health plans and/or a third party contractor to provide this oversight? Yes No Please explain: [500] BCBSAL has an active anti-fraud and abuse program t o ensure the integrity of benefit administration. The mission of the Network Integrit y and Healthcare Analytics unit is to develop and continuously improve upon a comprehensive anti-frau d function, which will focus on the prevention, detection, investigation and resolution of fraud an d abuse.

For the reporting period, please provide an over view of your state's political and fiscal environme nt as it relates to health care for low income, uninsured children and families, and how this environment impacted CHIP. [7500] During FY 2012, ALL Kids had projected a $10 millio n state budget deficit for FY 2013. However, even with the early measures taken in FY 2012 to re duce program costs, a deficit was still projected for FY 2013. Therefore, additional cost saving mea sures were added: As of August 1, 2013 copayments were established for therapy services (p hysical, speech, and occupational), vision services, and chiropractic services. At the Governor's request, during FY 2013, the Stat e Health Officer continued to lead transformation activities for the Alabama Medicaid Agency as well direct the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) in which ALL Kids is located. To meet requi rements of the Affordable Care Act, ADPH has developed a new joint CHIP/Medicaid eligibility and enrollment system. This system interacts with the Federally Facilitated Marketplace and the Federal D ata Hub. To ensure \"no wrong door\" application processing, eligibility determinations for both ALL Kids and Medicaid will be performed by staff in bo th agencies. In addition, call center staff in both ag encies will be able to provide information on both programs and have the ability to assist the caller with completion of a telephone application. 2. During the reporting period, what has been the g reatest challenge your program has experienced? [7500] The two greatest challenges faced by ALL Kids durin g FY 2013 were: (1) Responding to a projected $10 million state budget deficit; (2) preparing for implementation of the Affordable Care Act 3. During the reporting period, what accomplishment s have been achieved in your program? [7500] Development of new joint CHIP/Medicaid eligibilit y and enrollment system Continued implementation of a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Maximizing Enrollment Grant Continued, beyond grant funding, Covering Alabama Kids and Families Project 4. What changes have you made or are planning to ma ke in your CHIP program during the next fiscal year? Please comment on why the changes are planne d. [7500] Continue to enhance and refine the new eligibilit y and enrollment system and move forward with inclusion of the Medicaid Elderly and Disabled Prog ram.
