The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) requested and funded this report. The reports and assessments provide organizations with comprehensive, science-based information on common, costly medical conditions and new health care technologies. The EPCs systematically review the relevant scientific literature on topics assigned to them by AHRQ and conduct additional analyses when appropriate prior to developing their reports and assessments. To bring the broadest range of experts into the development of evidence reports and health technology assessments, AHRQ encourages the EPCs to form partnerships and enter into collaborations with other medical and research organizations. The EPCs work with these partner organizations to ensure that the evidence reports and technology assessments they produce will become building blocks for health care quality improvement projects throughout the Nation. The reports undergo peer review prior to their release. AHRQ expects that the EPC evidence reports and technology assessments will inform individual health plans, providers, and purchasers as well as the health care system as a whole by providing important information to help improve health care quality.

Conventional treatments have been shown to have limited benefit in improving patient outcomes. Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) therapies offer additional options in the management of low back and neck pain. Many trials evaluating CAM therapies have poor quality and inconsistent results. Objectives: To systematically review the efficacy, effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and harms of acupuncture, spinal manipulation, mobilization, and massage techniques in management of back, neck, and/or thoracic pain. Data Sources: MEDLINE, Cochrane Central, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CINAHL, and EMBASE were searched up to 2010; unpublished literature and reference lists of relevant articles were also searched. Study Selection: All records were screened by two independent reviewers. Primary reports of comparative efficacy, effectiveness, harms, and/or economic evaluations from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of the CAM therapies in adults (age \u0095 18 years) with back, neck, or thoracic pain were eligible. Non-randomized controlled trials and observational studies (case\u00adcontrol, cohort, cross-sectional) comparing harms were also included. Reviews, case reports, editorials, commentaries or letters were excluded. Data Extraction: Two independent reviewers using a predefined form extracted data on study, participants, treatments, and outcome characteristics. Data Analysis: Included studies were stratified by the region, cause, and duration of pain. Evidence was summarized qualitatively and RCTs were pooled according to the post-treatment followup at which the outcomes were measured. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were planned a priori. Publication bias was examined through visual inspection of funnel plot and a regression- based method. Results: 265 RCTs and 5 non-RCTs were included. Acupuncture for chronic nonspecific low back pain was associated with significantly lower pain intensity than placebo but only immediately post-treatment (VAS: -0.59, 95 percent CI: -0.93, -0.25). However, acupuncture was not different from placebo in post-treatment disability, pain medication intake, or global improvement in chronic nonspecific low back pain. Acupuncture did not differ from sham-acupuncture in reducing chronic non-specific neck pain immediately after treatment (VAS: \u00ad0.24, 95 percent CI: -1.20, 0.73). Acupuncture was superior to no treatment in improving pain intensity (VAS: -1.19, 95 percent CI: (SF-36), and range of mobility (extension, flexion), immediately after the treatment. In general, trials that applied sham-acupuncture tended to produce negative results (i.e., statistically non-significant) compared to trials that applied other types of placebo (e.g., TENS, medication, laser). Results regarding comparisons with other active treatments (pain vii medication, mobilization, laser therapy) were less consistent Acupuncture was more cost- effective compared to usual care or no treatment for patients with chronic back pain. For both low back and neck pain, manipulation was significantly better than placebo or no treatment in reducing pain immediately or short-term after the end of treatment. Manipulation was also better than acupuncture in improving pain and function in chronic nonspecific low back pain. Results from studies comparing manipulation to massage, medication, or physiotherapy were inconsistent, either in favor of manipulation or indicating no significant difference between the two treatments. Findings of studies regarding costs of manipulation relative to other therapies were inconsistent. Mobilization was superior to no treatment but not different from placebo in reducing low back pain or spinal flexibility after the treatment. Mobilization was better than physiotherapy in reducing low back pain (VAS: -0.50, 95 percent -3.96). In subjects with acute or subacute neck pain, mobilization compared to placebo significantly reduced neck pain. Mobilization and placebo did not differ in subjects with chronic neck pain. Massage was superior to placebo or no treatment in reducing pain and disability only amongst subjects with acute/sub-acute low back pain. Massage was also significantly better than physical therapy in improving back pain (VAS: -2.11, 95 percent CI: -3.15, -1.07) or disability. For subjects with neck pain, massage was better than no treatment, placebo, or exercise in improving pain or disability, but not neck flexibility. Some evidence indicated higher costs for massage use compared to general practitioner care for low back pain. Reporting of harms in RCTs was poor and inconsistent. Subjects receiving CAM therapies reported soreness or bleeding on the site of application after acupuncture and worsening of pain after manipulation or massage. In two case-control studies cervical manipulation was shown to be significantly associated with vertebral artery dissection or vertebrobasilar vascular accident. Conclusions: Evidence was of poor to moderate grade and most of it pertained to chronic non\u00ad specific pain, making it difficult to draw more definitive conclusions regarding benefits and harms of CAM therapies in subjects with acute/subacute, mixed, or unknown duration of pain. The benefit of CAM treatments was mostly evident immediately or shortly after the end of the treatment and then faded with time. Very few studies reported long-term outcomes. There was insufficient data to explore subgroup effects. The trial results were inconsistent due probably to methodological and clinical diversity, thereby limiting the extent of quantitative synthesis and complicating interpretation of trial results. Strong efforts are warranted to improve the conduct methodology and reporting quality of primary studies of CAM therapies. Future well powered head to head comparisons of CAM treatments and trials comparing CAM to widely used active treatments that report on all clinically relevant outcomes are needed to draw better conclusions. viii Contents Executive Summary ............................................................................................................. ....... 1 Evidence Report ...................................................................................................................... 13 Chapter 1.

The prevalence of back and/or neck pain in US in 2007 was estimated to be 31 percent. The costs associated with low productivity, lost-time at work, permanent disability, and healthcare are enormous. Conventional medical treatments have been shown to have limited effectiveness in the management of back and neck pain. Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) therapies offer additional options for management of back and neck pain. The number of people in Western societies using CAM therapies is increasing. The most prevalent CAM therapies are spinal manipulation, acupuncture, and massage. The number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating CAM therapies for back and neck pain has increased over the past two decades. The results of these trials are inconsistent. The University of Ottawa Evidence-based Practice Center (UO-EPC) reviewed and synthesized evidence to better understand effectiveness and safety of the most prevalent CAM therapies in the management of back, neck, and thoracic pain in adults. The current review commissioned by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) aimed to address the following research Key Questions (KQ): KQ1. What is the efficacy, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the most prevalent types of practitioner-based manual CAM therapies (e.g., spinal manipulation, spinal mobilization, massage; acupuncture) compared to other CAM therapies, conventional therapies, placebo, no treatment, or wait list in improving outcomes (e.g., QoL, Pain, Function, progression of acute to chronic/ or disabling BP) in patients with nonspecific and certain specific (e.g. disc herniation, spinal stenosis, facet joint syndrome, whiplash) types of back and neck pain. a. For any of the CAM therapies found to be effective for BP, what factors influence success of treatments? i. Patient-specific factors ii. Socio-demographics (e.g., age, gender, race, education, income) iii. Comorbidities b. Severity, specific causes (as identified in Q1), and duration of BP i. Treatment-specific factors (e.g., dose, frequency, duration) ii. Treatment provider-specific factors (e.g., training, specialization, experience) c. Does the use of any of the 3 most prevalent types of CAM for BP in adults result in a decreased or increased utilization of conventional management (diagnostic tests, number of visits & dose of medications, procedures)? KQ2. What are the contraindications and safety profile of the three most prevalent CAM therapies for BP in adults compared to that for other CAM therapies, conventional therapies, placebo or no treatment? Does the safety profile of these therapies change across subgroups of patients with comorbidities? 1 Methods Data Sources and Search Strategy A comprehensive search was conducted in the following databases: MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED) were all searched from inception until February 2010. CINAHL, Mantis, and the ACP Journal Club were also searched from inception until September 2008. Additional literature was searched through bibliographies of relevant items. The Web sites of relevant organizations/agencies, trial registries, and conference proceedings were searched for the grey literature. Study Selection Criteria and Process Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting efficacy/effectiveness and/or economic data of the CAM therapies (acupuncture, manipulation, mobilization, massage) versus any inactive or active treatments in adults with back, neck, or thoracic pain were eligible. Nonrandomized controlled trials and observational studies (e.g., cohort, case-control, cross-sectional) reporting harms were also included. Reports published in English, German, Dutch, Chinese, Japanese, Italian, French, Portuguese, and Spanish were eligible for inclusion. Systematic and narrative reviews, case reports, editorials, commentaries or letters to the editor were excluded. Titles and abstracts of all identified bibliographies were screened for eligibility by two independent reviewers who later reviewed full-text reports of potentially eligible records. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Data Extraction Two independent reviewers extracted data using an a priori developed abstraction form. The abstracted data were crosschecked and conflicts were resolved by consensus. Primary efficacy/effectiveness outcomes included pain intensity (e.g., Visual Analog Scale-VAS, McGill Pain Questionnaire-MPQ) function (Hannover Functional Ability Questionnaire-HFAQ), and disability (e.g., Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire-RMDQ, Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire-NPQ, Pain Disability Index-PDI, and Oswestry Disability Index). Secondary outcomes included spinal range of motion (ROM), straight leg raise (SLR), finger-to-floor distance (FFD), and muscle strength. Harms (e.g., any adverse event, withdrawals due to adverse events, specific adverse events) were extracted as proportions of patients with an event. For cost-effectiveness analysis, data was extracted on: a) costs in the health care sector, b) costs of production loss, c) costs in other sectors, d) patient and family costs, and e) total costs. Assessment of Study Quality and Reporting The risk of bias for RCTs was assessed using the criteria list recommended in the Updated Method Guidelines for Systematic Reviews in the Cochrane Collaboration Back Review Group. Depending on the number of 'Yes' ratings (score range: 0-4) across four domains (treatment 2 allocation concealment, balance in baseline characteristics, blinding, and number/reasons for dropouts), the quality of individual studies was classified into three groups: good (score: 4), fair (score: 2-3), and poor (score: 0-1). The overall bias was explored using risk-of-bias graphs. The quality of observational studies was assessed using the modified Downs and Black tool. Methodological quality of economic studies was determined using the 19-item CHEC list. Quantitative Synthesis The results were grouped according to a type of experimental intervention (e.g., acupuncture, manipulation, mobilization, massage), pain location in spinal region (low back, neck, thorax), duration of pain (acute/sub-acute, chronic, mixed, unknown), and cause of pain (specific versus nonspecific). Study, treatment, population, and outcome characteristics were summarized in text and/or summary tables. We pooled RCTs with similar populations (demographics, duration, and cause of pain), same types of experimental and controls treatments, which reported outcomes measured with the same instruments (and scale) at similar post-treatment followup periods. The meta-analyses of pain were based on a 1-10 visual analogue scale. The random-effects models of DerSimonian and Laird were used to generate pooled estimates of relative risks (RRs) and weighted end point mean difference (WMDs) with 95 percent confidence intervals (CIs). Statistical heterogeneity was evaluated using the Chi-square test and the patients' age, gender) and sensitivity (e.g., trial quality) analyses were planned to investigate the sources of unexplained heterogeneity. If data allowed, the statistically significant pooled estimates of post-treatment pain intensity were planned to be examined in order to determine the degree of clinical importance for the observed differences between the treatment groups. The degree of clinical importance was defined as small (WMD < 10 percent of the VAS scale), medium (10 percent \u0094 WMD < 20 percent of the VAS scale), and large (WMD \u009520 percent of the VAS scale). Publication bias was examined through visual inspection of funnel plot asymmetry with respect to contours of statistical significance and the Egger's regression-based method. Rating the Strength of Evidence We assessed the overall strength of evidence using the approach of grading system outlined in the Methods guide prepared for the AHRQ Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) program. The grading method consists of four major domains: risk of bias (high, medium, low), consistency, directness, and precision. Body of evidence for a given outcome was classified into four groups: high, moderate, low, or insufficient (no evidence). The initial grade was reduced by one level (e.g., from high to moderate; from moderate to low) for each of the domains not met and by two levels in case of high risk of bias (e.g., from high to low grade; from moderate to low grade). 3 Results KQ1. Efficacy/effectiveness and Cost-effectiveness of CAM Therapies Compared to no Treatment, Placebo, and Other Active CAM/nonCAM Therapies in Management of Back, Neck, and/or Thoracic Pain. In total, 265 RCTs (including 10 reporting economic data), and five controlled observational studies which provided harms data were included. Most studies included subjects with chronic nonspecific pain. Immediate and short-term post-treatment follow-ups were most frequently reported. Only the main findings for pain, disability, and mobility are reported in this summary. Efficacy/Effectiveness Acupuncture - Low Back Pain. In subjects with chronic nonspecific LBP, acupuncture compared to placebo led to statistically significantly lower pain intensity (Grade - moderate) but only for the immediate-post-treatment followup (10 trials; pooled VAS: -0.59, 95 percent CI: \u00ad0.93, -0.25). Acupuncture did not significantly differ from placebo in improving pain intensity scores, well-being, disability, use of medication, proportion of subjects on sick leave, and proportion of subjects with global improvement at short-, intermediate-, and long-term post\u00ad treatment. Trials using TENS-sham, laser-sham, or medication-sham compared to those using sham-acupuncture tended to produce results in favor of acupuncture in relation to pain intensity and disability. Subjects in acupuncture group had statistically significantly better post-treatment pain intensity (three trials; pooled short-term VAS: -1.19, 95 percent CI: -2.17, pain disability index (one trial; immediate-term PDI; Grade - moderate), function (two - moderate), well-being (two trials; - moderate), or ROM (one trial; immediate-/intermediate-term extension, flexion Grade - low) compared to 'no treatment' group. Subjects in the acupuncture group compared with those in usual care had significantly better post-treatment pain intensity (two trials; short-/intermediate-term VAS; Grade - moderate), disability (two trials; short-/intermediate-term RMDQ; Grade - moderate), quality of life (one trial; intermediate-term SF-12; Grade - mode rate), or function (one trial; intermediate-term HFAQ; Grade - moderate). In two meta-analyses, acupuncture did not significantly differ from pain medication in reducing immediate post-treatment pain (four trials; immediate-term pooled VAS: 0.11, 95 percent -1.42, low) Oswestry: -2.40, 95 percent CI: -12.20, 7.40; Grade - low). In contrast, another meta-analyses indicated significantly worse post-treatment pain (two trials; immediate VAS: 3.70, 95 percent CI: 1.50, 5.80; Grade - low) for acupuncture versus manipulation. Subjects receiving acupuncture had significantly better immediate post-treatment pain and disability than subjects receiving physiotherapy (two trials; trial one - light, electricity and heat therapy; trial two - hot packs, ultrasound, short-wave diathermy, TENS, muscle strengthening; Grade - low). There was no difference between acupuncture and massage in healthcare 4 utilization (one trial; intermediate-term number of provider visits, percentage of subjects using medication; Grade - low). In subjects with acute nonspecific LBP there was no statistically significantly difference between acupuncture and usual care groups (one trial; immediate-short-intermediate-term RMDQ; Grade-low). Acupuncture - Neck Pain. Two meta-analyses indicated no significant difference between acupuncture and sham-acupuncture in subjects with chronic specific (two trials; Grade - moderate; VAS: 0.27, 95 percent CI: -0.60, -0.24, 95 percent CI: intensity. Trials using TENS-sham, laser-sham, or medication-sham compared to those using sham-acupuncture tended to produce results in favor of acupuncture in relation to pain intensity and disability. There were inconsistent results for immediate- or short-term post-treatment pain intensity between acupuncture and pain medication groups of subjects. Intermediate-term followup indicated no significant difference between acupuncture and pain medication groups. Acupuncture did not differ from standard mobilization and traction techniques or laser therapy in short-term post-treatment pain intensity or disability. Immediate/short-term post-treatment pain and disability were better in manipulation than acupuncture groups (two trials, Grade - low). Manipulation - Low Back Pain. In subjects with acute/sub-acute nonspecific LBP, manipulation was significantly more effective than placebo (five trials; Grade - moderate) or no treatment (one trial; Grade - low) in reducing pain intensity (VAS score) immediately or short- term after the end of treatment. There was no significant difference between manipulation and placebo in post-treatment pain medication intake, disability, or back flexibility (three trials; Grade -low). Manipulation did not differ from medication in reducing pain intensity (two trials; Grade - low). In subjects with chronic nonspecific LBP, manipulation was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing pain intensity (VAS score) immediately or short-term after the end of treatment (three trials; Grade - low). Manipu lation was significantly better (in immediate post\u00ad treatment pain; two trials; Grade - low) or no different (in intermediate-term post-treatment pain; one trial; Grade - low) from medication in improving pain intensity. In older subjects with mixed duration LBP, spinal manipulation was significantly better than medical care in improving immediate and short-term post-treatment disability (Oswestry) and perception of global improvement but not pain intensity or physical function (one trial; Grade - low). Results from studies comparing manipulation to massage or physiotherapy in improving post-treatment pain intensity (two trials; Grade - low) or mobility (three trials; grade - low) were inconsistent, either in favor of manipulation or indicating no significant difference between the two treatments. In two large trials (UK BEAM and Childs 2004), subjects receiving combination of manipulation and exercise or best care by general practitioner improved in pain and disability compared to subjects with no spinal manipulation treatment (Grade - Moderate). Manipulation - Neck Pain. Subjects receiving manipulation had significantly better post\u00ad treatment pain (two trials; Grade - moderate ) disability (one trial; Grade - low), or mobility (extension, flexion, rotation) (one trial; Grade - low) compared to those taking placebo. Manipulation did not significantly differ from medication in reducing pain intensity (three trials; Grade - moderate) and disability (two trials - Grade - moderate). 5 Mobilization - Low Back Pain. There were no significant differences in pain intensity (VAS) and ROM (flexion, extension, floor to floor) between subjects who received mobilization and placebo immediately or short-term after treatment (two trials; specific acute/sub-acute and nonspecific mixed duration pain; grade - low). Subjects with specific acute/sub-acute pain receiving mobilization had significantly reduced intake of analgesic medication and duration of sick leave compared to those receiving placebo (one trial; Grade - low). Subjects with acute/sub-acute and chronic pain (specific or nonspecific) receiving mobilization experienced significantly improved pain intensity (VAS, MPQ) and lumbar ROM (side bending) compared to subjects not receiving any treatment, immediately and short-term after treatment (two trials; Grade - low). Results regarding disability (RMDQ, Oswestry) were inconsistent, showing either a significant difference in favor of mobilization (one trial; Grade - low) or no difference between mobilization and no treatment (one trial; Grade - low). In subjects with mixed duration of pain, there were no significant differences in pain intensity (VAS) and ROM (flexion, extension) immediately or short-term after treatment (one trial; Grade - low). In two meta-analyses, subjects with chronic nonspecific pain receiving mobilization (traditional bone setting) compared to physiotherapy (massage, stretching, trunk exercise) had significantly lower pain intensity (two trials, Grade - low; VAS score: -0.50, 95 percent CI: \u00ad 0.70, -0.30) (two trials, Oswestry score: -4.93, 95 percent CI: -5.91, -3.96) immediately after treatment. There was no significant difference between the groups in the mean finger to floor distance immediately after treatment (two trials, Grade - moderate; -0.89, 95 percent CI: -1.89, 0.12). Similarly, mobilization and physiotherapy groups did not significantly differ in ROM (Schober's test, extension, straight leg raising) immediately or intermediate-term after treatment (one trial; Grade - low). In subjects with nonspecific pain of mixed duration, mobilization was significantly superior to physiotherapy (massage, mobilization, thermal, and electrotherapies according to the Finnish routine) in reducing disability (Oswestry), but only at intermediate term post-treatment (one trial, Grade - low). There was no significant difference between the groups in the number of sick leave days for the trial period. The immediate- or intermediate-term post-treatment pain intensity (VAS score; one trial; Grade - low), disability (Oswestry; one trial; Grade - low), and ROM (Schober's test, extension, straight leg raising; two trials; Grade - low) did not significantly differ between mobilization and exercise given to subjects with nonspecific chronic or mixed duration of pain. Mobilization - Neck Pain. Mobilization was significantly better than placebo in subjects with acute/sub-acute nonspecific pain (one trial; Grade - Low), but did not differ from placebo in subjects with chronic nonspecific pain (one trial; Grade - low). Subjects with chronic or mixed nonspecific pain receiving mobilization had significantly lower pain intensity compared to no treatment (two trials; Grade - Low). There was no significant difference between the mobilization and no treatment groups in the mean intake of analgesic medication pills and the number of sick leave days immediately or short-term after treatment (one trial; Grade - low). Mobilization was significantly better than massage or physiotherapy (massage, stretching and exercise) in improving pain (VAS score), disability (NDI), global assessment, analgesic medication intake, and the number of sick leave days in chronic nonspecific pain at intermediate- term post-treatment followup (one trial; Grade - Low). Subjects with mixed duration nonspecific 6 pain in the mobilization and continued general practitioner care groups had similar post\u00ad treatment pain intensity and disability (VAS and NDI; one trial; Grade - low). Massage - Low Back Pain. Subjects with nonspecific acute/sub-acute pain receiving massage had significantly better pain intensity (VAS, MPQ) and disability (Oswestry) compared to no treatment (one trial; Grade - low) or placebo (two trials; Grade -moderate) immediately or short-term after the end of treatment. In subjects with nonspecific chronic pain, massage did not significantly differ from no treatment or placebo in improving immediate or intermediate-term post-treatment pain intensity (VAS, MPQ; two trials; Grade - low), disability (Oswestry, RMDQ; two trials; Grade - low), general health perception (one trial; Grade - low), or health status (SF-36; one trial; Grade - low). In two meta-analyses, massage was significantly better in reducing pain compared to relaxation (two trials; Grade - low; VAS score: -1.27, 95 percent CI: -0.08) score: -2.11, 95 percent CI: -3.15, -1.07) immediately after treatment in subjects with chronic nonspecific pain. In another meta-analysis, massage was not significantly better than relaxation in improving immediate post-treatment ROM (two trials; Grade - low; trunk flexion: 2.21, 95 percent CI: -1.10, 5.52). In subjects with chronic nonspecific pain, massage was significantly more effective than physical therapy in reducing pain (SF-PQ, VAS), disability (RMDQ, modified Oswestry), and the number of days off work immediately or intermediate-term after the treatment (two trials; Grade - low). In subjects with chronic nonspecific pain, there was no significant difference between receiving massage and general practitioner care in improving pain (VAS score), disability (RMDQ), or well-being (SF-36) intermediate-term after th e end of treatment (one trial; Grade - low). Massage - Neck Pain. Subjects with acute/sub-acute, chronic, or unknown duration of nonspecific pain receiving massage had significantly improved pain ( \u00952-point decrease on NRS\u00ad 11, VAS, Pressure Pain Threshold scores) compared to placebo (three trials; Grade - Low), immediately after treatment. In subjects with chronic specific pain, massage did not significantly differ from placebo in improving range of mobility (one trial; Grade - low) or well-being (SF-36, role physical, pain index; one trial; Grade - low). Massage, compared to no treatment, significantly improved pain intensity (NPQ, VAS scores) but not ROM (flexion, extension) in subjects with chronic or unknown duration of nonspecific pain, immediately after the end of treatment (two trials; Grade - low). In subjects with chronic nonspecific pain (one trial; Grade - Low), massage compared to exercise significantly improved disability (NPQ) but not ROM (flexion, extension). 7 Cost-effectiveness This review included results from 10 studies of full economic evaluations of acupuncture (low back pain: two studies, neck pain: one study), spinal manipulation (low back pain: four studies, neck pain: two studies), and massage (one study) for low back and neck pain. Acupuncture - Low back pain. Two economic evaluations showed that acupuncture was cost- effective compared to usual care and compared to no treatment in patients with chronic low back pain. However, in both studies health gains were small and one study used no treatment control group and had only 3 months followup. Acupuncture - Neck pain. One study showed that in subjects with chronic neck pain acupuncture use was associated with significantly higher total costs compared to usual care ($1,565 versus $1,496). Manipulation - Low back pain. There were no differences in costs between manual therapy, general practitioner care and intensive therapy for acute low back pain. Costs were higher for manipulation compared with medical care without producing better clinical outcomes for patients with mixed duration of LBP (acute, subacute and chronic). This was associated with significantly more visits to chiropractic care than medical care. Spinal manipulation in addition to general practitioner care was relatively cost-effective compared to general practitioner care alone for patients with sub-acute and chronic low back pain. In chronic LBP patients, there were no differences in costs between physician consultation, spinal manipulation plus stabilizing exercises, and physician consultation alone. Results are difficult to compare due to differences in health care systems, perspectives, interventions, populations, and methods used. Manipulation - Neck pain. One study in subjects with neck pain found that pulsed short-wave diathermy was less cost-effective compared with manual therapy or exercise/advise. In another study, manual therapy was less costly and more effective than physiotherapy (functional, active and postural or relaxation exercises, and stretching) or general practitioner care. Massage - Low back pain. One study reported an economic evaluation of therapeutic massage, exercise, Alexander technique, and usual general practitioner care in patients with chronic low back pain showing that massage was more costly and less effective than usual care by the general practitioner. 8 KQ1 a-c. Patient- and Trial-specific Factors Influencing Treatment Success The amount of evidence regarding factors potentially influencing treatment effect (e.g., age, gender race, education, income, cause of pain, type of treatment provider, dose of treatment) was relatively limited. There was no discernable pattern indicating that the effect of acupuncture was different in subjects with specific and nonspecific pain (neck and low back pain). In one trial (Grade - Low), the subject's age, gender, symptom duration, or the therapist's years of experience did not have a significant effect on the mean change for Oswestry score between spinal manipulation in addition to exercise and exer cise alone. In another trial (Grade - Moderate) the beneficial effect of massage compared to physical therapy (physical modalities, exercise and traction) was similar across age (\u0094 50, and > 50 years) and gender groups. Massage was significantly better in reducing pain intensity compared to physical therapy in subjects with severe pain at baseline. The reduction in pain intensity did not differ between the massage and physical therapy groups amongst subjects with lower baseline pain scores. The baseline severity did not modify the effect of massage (versus physical therapy) measured at intermediate-term after the end of treatment (i.e., massage was significantly better than physical therapy in reducing pain across the baseline pain severity groups). This review identified evidence on utilization of conventional healthcare (e.g., routine visits to physician, use of analgesics, hospital stay) and work absenteeism. The use of conventional healthcare was not different in acupuncture versus self care, usual care, or massage for subject with chronic LBP (two trials). Similarly, the use of conventional care did not differ between spinal manipulation and hospital outpatient management, or physician consultation for LBP (two trials). In contrast, the use of conventional care was significantly reduced for subjects receiving spinal manipulation in addition to exercise compared to exercise alone (one trial). The use of analgesics was significantly reduced for acupuncture versus placebo, waiting list, TENS, or usual care in LBP (four trials); and between acupuncture and placebo in subjects with neck pain (one trial). In contrast, the use of analgesics did not significantly differ between acupuncture and self care in LBP (one trail); between acupuncture and placebo, self care, or other treatments for NP (five trials). Similarly, the use of analgesics did not differ between spinal manipulation and placebo, or conventional care in subjects with low back pain(five trials, Grade - Low); between spinal manipulation or mobilization and prescription medication, no treatment neck collar, or physiotherapy for subjects with neck pain (five trials). The extent of work absenteeism was significantly greater in exercise alone versus acupuncture in LBP (one trial); between mobilization and no treatment or physiotherapy in neck pain (two trials). Sick leaves due to pain, did not differ between acupuncture and placebo or usual care in LBP (two trails); and between mobilization and neck collar or 'act as usual' in neck pain (one trial). The sensitivity analysis, performed on acupuncture trials, found no evidence that treatment effect was strongly influenced by study quality. The pooled estimates of mean difference in pain intensity (VAS score) for 'lower risk-of-bias' and 'higher risk-of-bias' -1.39, -0.11), respectively. 9 KQ2. Harms of CAM Therapies The reporting of harms was poor across studies of CAM interventions. Only very few trials reported any information on adverse events. The reported information was not detailed, lacked consistency, and was not comparable. No definitions were presented. Therefore, the rates of adverse events between the different interventions could not be meaningfully compared. Acupuncture. The reported events in RCTs were mostly of moderate transient nature amongst these most commonly reported events were soreness/pain at the site of needling, bruising light headedness, minor bleeding, dizziness, or headache. The proportion of subjects with any adverse event did not reportedly differ in acupuncture versus TENS or usual care groups. In one nonrandomized trial, discomfort or soreness in the acupuncture, chiropractic therapy, and massage groups were 5.0 percent, 8.0 percent, and 7.0 percent, respectively. Manipulation/Mobilization. The reported events in RCTs were mostly moderate in severity and of transient nature (e.g., increased pain). In one RCT, after 2 weeks of treatment, patients with neck pain receiving manipulation were not at significantly increased risk for having an adverse event compared to patients receiving mobilization (OR = 1.44, 95 percent CI: 0.83, 2.49). In another RCT, the proportion of patients with neck pain having adverse events was similar in manipulation versus Diazepam groups (9.5 percent versus 11.1 percent). In two case control studies, subjects \u0094 45 years of age with vertebro-basilar artery (VBA) stroke were more likely to visit a chiropractic or primary care physician than subjects without VBA stroke. This association was not observed in older subject visiting a chiropractic clinic. In one case control study, the excess risk of vascular accident was observed for both, subjects undergoing chiropractic care and subjects undergoing primary care treatments. In another case-control study, subjects with cervical artery dissection were more likely to have had spinal manipulation within 30 days (OR = 6.62, 95 percent CI: 1.4, 30.0). In one cohort study, rate of complications did not differ between subjects with low back pain receiving manipulation plus mobilization versus no treatment. Massage. In few RCTs, subjects receiving massage experienced worsening of back/neck pain or soreness of mild and transient nature. One study reported allergic reactions (rashes and pimples) in five subjects due to massage oil. In one RCT, the proportion of patients with neck pain having adverse events in massage group was lower (7.0 percent) compared to acupuncture (33.0 percent) or placebo-laser (21.0 percent). Conclusions and Future Research This review identified a large amount of evidence on comparative effectiveness of single mode CAM interventions for management of back and neck pain in subjects with a wide spectrum of causes (specific and nonspecific) and duration (acute to chronic) of pain. The reviewed evidence was of low to moderate grade and inconsistent probably due to substantial methodological and/or clinical diversity, thereby rendering some between-treatment comparisons inconclusive. The differences in the therapy provider's experience, training, and approaches (e.g., deep or superficial massage, choice of trigger points, needling techniques) may have additionally contributed to disparate results. Evidence for acute, sub-acute, and mixed specific pain was sparse compared to that for chronic nonspecific pain. Poorly reported harms data limited our ability to meaningfully compare rates of adverse events between the treatments. 10 Generally, CAM treatments were more effective in reducing pain and disability compared to no treatment, physical therapy, or standard care immediately or at short-term followup. Results of trials comparing CAM treatment to sham were less consistent either showing significant differences in favor of CAM or no significant differences between the treatments. For chronic nonspecific back pain, acupuncture was better than placebo but only for improving pain intensity at immediately post-treatment. The long-term post-treatment disability and utilization of conventional healthcare did not differ between subjects with low back pain receiving acupuncture and usual care. Trials that applied sham-acupuncture tended to produce negative results (i.e., statistically nonsignificant) compared to trials that applied other types of placebo (e.g., TENS, medication, laser) between acupuncture and placebo groups. Acupuncture significantly decreased pain medication use compared with no treatment or placebo, but not so compared with self-care, Botulinum toxin, or Lidocaine injection. There was no statistically significant difference between acupuncture and control treatments for the number of visits to other healthcare providers. Manipulation did not differ from pain medication in improving pain intensity. Manipulation was significantly more effective than acupuncture in reducing immediate post-treatment pain intensity. Results for pain intensity or disability were inconsistent regarding manipulation compared to massage or physiotherapy for treatment of LBP. Subjects receiving manipulation did not differ in healthcare utilization from subjects receiving exercise, physician consultation, medical care, or placebo. In chronic or mixed duration of low back pain, mobilization was similar to placebo in reducing pain or to physiotherapy (which may include a combination of manual treatment and physical modality but not physical modalities alone) in improving immediately after or short term post\u00adtreatment. For subjects with chronic neck pain, acupuncture was not different from sham-acupuncture, pain medication, mobilization/traction, or laser therapy in reducing pain or disability after the treatment. Subjects with neck pain benefited more with manipulation than placebo in terms of pain, disability, and neck flexibility. Mobilization was more effective than placebo in improving acute/subacute neck pain but not chronic neck pain. In subjects with neck pain (chronic, mixed duration), mobilization was better than no treatment in reducing pain intensity, but not in reducing the intake of pain medication pills or the number of sick leave days immediately or short-term after the treatment. Mobilization was better than physiotherapy or massage in reducing pain intensity and disability in subjects with chronic nonspecific neck pain. Massage was not different from placebo in improving well-being or ROM in subjects with chronic neck pain. In summary, the degree of clinical importance for the differences in pooled pain intensity observed between the treatment groups for low back pain was small (acupuncture versus placebo; mobilization versus physical therapy), medium (acupuncture versus no treatment; massage versus relaxation), or large (acupuncture versus manipulation, in favor of manipulation; massage versus physical therapy). Due to the small number of economic evaluations, inconsistent standards of comparison, and substantial heterogeneity (diversity of healthcare payment systems across countries) it was not possible to reach clear conclusions about the cost-effectiveness of any of the CAM treatments. Spinal manipulation for back pain was not cost-effective relative to medical care. Acupuncture was cost-effective relative to usual care or no treatment in subjects with back pain. Evidence for massage was insufficient. 11 In several studies subjects receiving CAM therapies reported soreness or bleeding on the site of application (acupuncture groups) and worsening of pain/back pain (manipulation/massage groups). More data from long term and large head to head trials with sufficient duration of CAM treatments and trials comparing CAM treatment to other widely used active treatments (e.g. comprehensive physiotherapy) reporting clinically relevant and validated outcomes (e.g. pain intensity, disability, direct and indirect costs, utility of conventional care, and adverse events) are needed for definitive conclusions. Future studies should control for or examine the influence of treatment dose/duration, care provider-(e.g. certification, years of experience) and population-specific variables on treatment effect estimate. 12 Evidence Report 15 Chapter 1. Introduction Background Back and neck pain are important health problems with serious societal and economic consequences. One study publ ished in 2007 showed that the 3 month prevalence of back and/or neck pain in U .S. was 31 percent (low bac k pain: 34 million, neck pain: nine million , both back and neck pain: 19 million).1 Most of the acute back pain episodes resolve spontaneously within a few days or weeks with frequent recurrences. The burden related to back pain results from t he minority of the acute cases that become chronic leading to low productivity, lost -time at work, permanent disability, and healthcare costs which are enormous. A recently published systematic review of 27 studies showed that the largest proportion of dir ect medical costs for low back pain was spent on physical therapy (17 percent ) and inpatient services (17 percent ), followed by pharmacy (13 percent ) and primary care (13 percent ). Among studies providing estimates of total costs, indirect costs resulting from lost work productivity accounted for the majority of overall costs associated with low back pain. Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) offers additional options for the management of back and neck pain problems. The number of people in Western society who seek the care with CAM therapies is increasing. The most prevalent CAM therapies for back and neck pain are spinal manipula tion, acupuncture, and massage.2 These interventions have the following aspects in common: a hands -on therapy, mult iple visits, utilize primarily passive with some active modality elements, prolonged interaction with the healthcare practitioner and a naturalistic approach that avoids drugs or surgical interventions. Most Commonly Used CAM Therapies for Back P ain Acupunctu re is one of the oldest forms of therapy and has its roots in ancient Chinese philosophy. According to the classic acupuncture theory all disorders are reflected at specific points, either on the skin surface or just below it. An appropriate choice of the 361 classic acupuncture points is believed to restore the balance in the body. Modern acupuncturists use not only traditional meridian acupuncture points, but also nonmeridian or extra -meridian acupuncture points. Many acupuncturists (particularly those wi th conventional medical training) practice without reference to traditional Chinese concepts. The exact mechanisms underlying t he action of acupuncture remain unclear. It has been suggested that acupuncture might act by principles of the gate control theor y of pain. Another theory relates to diffuse noxious inhibitory control (DNIC), which implies that noxious stimulation of heterotopic body areas modulates the pain sensation originating in areas where a patient feels pain. There is also some evidence that acupuncture may stimulate the production of endorphins, serotonin, and acetylcholine within the central nervous system, enhancing analgesia.3 Acupuncture is a heterogeneous set of diverse practices and therefore some types of acupuncture maybe more effecti ve than others. Spinal manipulation therapy is defined as the application of high -velocity, low -amplitude manual thrusts to the spinal joints. The practice of spinal manipulation is frequently performed by chiropractors ,4 and also by osteopaths, and physic al therapists. The mechanism of effect of spinal manipulation is unclear; it is hypothesized that spinal manipulation displaces and deforms the tissues, altering orientation or position of anatomic structures, unbuckling some structures, 16 releasing entrappe d structures or disrupting adhesions. Other hypotheses focus on the neurological response of cell or matrix system s to the input forces of spinal manipulation. Evidence suggests that spinal manipulation impacts primary afferent neurons from paraspinal tissues, the motor control system, and pain processing.5 Spinal mobilization is another commonly used manual therapy that uses low grade/velocity , small or large amplitude passive movement and neuromuscular techniques within a patient's range of motion. The mechanism of action of spinal mobilization is also not entirely clear. It has been proposed that these spinal techniques improve signs and symptoms by directly facilitating the restricted mobility of the facet joints and simultaneously influencing the mobi lity of the intervertebral joint.6 Spinal mobilization is frequently performed by chiropractors ,4 and also by osteopaths, and physical therapists. Massage is a way of easing pain, while at the same time aiding relaxation and promoting a feeling of well -being and a sense of receiving good care by manipulation of local or remote soft tissue . The mechanisms by which massage exerts these multiple therapeutic effects are not yet known. It was hypothesized7 that massaging affected muscles and fascia induces local biochemical changes that modulate local blood flow and oxygenation in muscle. These local effects may influence neural activity at the spinal cord segmental level and could modulate the activities of subcortical nuclei that influence mood and pain percept ion. Soft tissue massage may increase the pain threshold through the release of endorphins. Mechanistic studies are needed to delineate underlying biologic and psychological effects of massage and their relationship to outcomes.3 It is important to note th at manual therapies ( massage and manipulation / mobilization ) are practiced in different ways by different practitioners (e.g. chiropractic manipulation may be quite distinct from that practiced by a physical therapist) . Additionally, nonspecific effects of therapy (i.e. attention/touch/empathy) need to be also considered. For example, it is difficult to separate out specific effects from nonspecific effects of CAM treatment due to the inability to blind subjects to the treatment. Back Pain and Treatmen t Approaches The classification of back pain is not consistent within the clinical community. Generally, back pain treatments are aimed at specific anatomical regions (cervical, thoracic, and lumbar); there is variation in how the various CAM techniques a ctually affect the intended region currently being treated or other parts of the back. In addition to the body region, clinicians tend to define and develop treatment approaches for back pain based on the perceived underlying mechanical or pathological dia gnosis; patients are generally categorized into specific back or nonspecific back pain groups. Specific back pain can include such patient diagnoses as radiculopathopathy, degenerative disc disease, disc herniation, spinal stenosis, or myofascial pain synd rome to name a few. Nonspecific back pain represents the largest clinical groups in which patients are categorized and generally reflects that no particular functional or structural factor is ascribed as the primary source of the current episode. Within bo th these categories of back pain, there is inconsistency in the manner in which patients are assigned to one or the other category. This problem is further compounded when considering that back pain is recurrent in nature; therefore, many patients with acu te back pain may in fact have chronic back pain but are currently being treated for an acute exacerbation. All these factors are potentially key sources of heterogeneity across studies. 17 Given the inconsistency of grouping persons with symptomatic back pai n, it is not surprising that there is significant variation in the treatment approaches used. Variation is further increased by the differing health professionals as well as differing philosophies of treatment within a specific health discipline. Finally, clinicians frequently employ mixed modalities when treating patients with back pain that can be within a specific CAM therapy (for example manipulation and mobilization) or across different types of CAM therapies (for example combining mobilization with ac upuncture and exercise). Our primary focus in this systematic review is on evaluating the efficacy of the most prevalent CAM therapies, massage, manual therapy, and acupuncture; a nd as such, we limited combined treatments to those which would allow evaluat ion of each of these primary CAM therapies. Chapter 2. Methods Key Questions The current systematic review is supported by (NCCAM) and (AHRQ) in order to better understand the status of research that has been done in treatment of back pain (cervical, thoracic, lumbar regions) with some of the most prevalent CAM interventions as identified by a recent review (CAM I) 1. What is the efficacy, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the most prevalent types of practitioner-based manual CAM therapies (e.g., spinal manipulation, spinal mobilization, massage; acupuncture) compared to other CAM therapies, conventional therapies, placebo, no treatment, or wait list in improving outcomes (e.g., QoL, Pain, Function, progression of acute to chronic/ or disabling BP) in patients with nonspecific and certain specific (e.g. disc herniation, spinal stenosis, facet joint syndrome, whiplash) types of back and neck pain. a. For any of the CAM therapies found to be effective for BP, what factors influence success of treatments? i. Patient-specific factors: ii. Socio-demographics (e.g., age, gender, race, education, income) iii. Comorbidities b. Severity, specific causes (as identified in Q1), and duration of BP i. Treatment-specific factors (e.g., dose, frequency, duration) ii. Treatment provider-specific factors (e.g., training, specialization, experience) c. Does the use of any of the three most prevalent types of CAM for BP in adults result in a decreased or increased utilization of conventional management (diagnostic tests, number of visits & dose of medications, procedures)? 2. What are the contraindications and safety profile of the three most prevalent CAM therapies for BP in adults compared to that for other CAM therapies, conventional therapies, placebo or no treatment?

We searched the following electronic databases: MEDLINE In-Process & Other NonIndexed 1950 to 2010 February Week 1); the Cochrane Library 2010 Issue 1 including CENTRAL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, DARE, HTA, and NHSEED; EMBASE (1980 to 2010 Week 4); CINAHL (1982 to September Week 3 2008); AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine: 1985 to January 2010); Mantis (1880 to October 2008); EBM Reviews - ACP Journal Club (1991 to August 2008). Specialized CAM databases were also searched, including the Index to Chiropractic Literature (ILC) October 2008; Acubriefs 2008 October; Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NZ) 2008; and the LILACS Database October 2008. Some of these databases provided extensive coverage of foreign language materials (e.g., Asian, South American studies). Bibliographic records of potentially relevant nonEnglish publications were retrieved in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Central, Acubriefs, AMED, LILACS, and Mantis. There was no unique database for foreign language records. We utilized strategies combining controlled vocabulary and keywords such as Acupuncture, Electroacupuncture, Needling, Acupressure, Moxibustion, and Manipulative Medicine. The searches were not restricted to any language or date. Additional potentially eligible references were sought through hand-searching the bibliographies of relevant items. (Appendix A) We identified unpublished literature through searching the Web sites of relevant specialty societies and organizations, health technology assessment agencies, economic research institutions, guideline collections, trial registries, and conferences. Study Selection To assess relative benefits and harms as well as cost-effectiveness of CAM treatments' (i.e., acupuncture, manipulation, mobilization, massage, and flexion-distraction technique) use in adults (age \u0095 18 years) with back, neck, headache, or thoracic pain (acute, sub-acute, chronic, mixed duration), we selected primary reports of comparative efficacy/harms and economic evaluation from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Trials including participants with pain due to specific or nonspecific causes were eligible for inclusion in the review. Additionally, nonrandomized controlled trials and observational studies (e.g., cohort, case-control, cross-sectional studies) reporting comparative data on long-term (> 6 months) harms were eligible for inclusion. Control (comparator) treatments included no treatment, placebo (sham), or any other active treatment (e.g., CAM therapy, medication, physiotherapy, ultrasound, exercise, heat/cold therapy, electrotherapy, spinal mechanical traction, spinal injection, aquatic therapy). Trials using combination of CAM with other 'active therapy' versus the same 'active therapy' were included only if the effect of CAM alone was ascertained, based on the assumption of no interaction between the CAM and the 'active therapy'. Trials using a combination of manipulation and mobilization in an experimental arm were also included in the review. The review of non-English publications was limited to German, Dutch, Chinese, Japanese, Italian, French, Portuguese, and Spanish. We included relevant unpublished literature in the 21 review. Systematic and narrative reviews, case reports, editorials, commentaries or letters to the editor were excluded. The results of the literature search were uploaded to the software program TrialStat SRS version 4.0 along with screening questions developed by the review team and supplemental instructions. A calibration exercise was undertaken to pilot and refine the screening process. Initially, two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts of all identified bibliographic records (screening level I). Then the same reviewers retrieved and reviewed full-text reports of all potentially eligible records (screening level II). Di screpancies at both screening levels were discussed and resolved by consensus. The literature selection process, including reasons for exclusions, is presented in the PRISMA study flow diagram (Chapter 3, Figure 2). Data Abstraction Two reviewers independently abstracted relevant information from each included study using an a priori developed abstraction form. The abstracted data were crosschecked and conflicts were resolved by consensus. The abstracted data included study characteristics (study author, design, sample size, country), type of experimental treatment (e.g., acupuncture, spinal manipulation), type of control treatment (e.g., pain medication, neck exercise, traction, sham-acupuncture, advice, education, no treatment/waiting list), treatment-related factors (e.g., spine region of administration, frequency, number of sessions, dose, specific acupoints, depth/duration of needle insertion, electrical stimulation of needles, mechanically assisted manipulation, manual acupuncture), baseline population characteristics (e.g., age, gender, race, pain location/extension, duration of pain, cause of pain, pain severity, comorbidities), and treatment provider-specific factors (e.g., years of education/experience, specialization, training). The abstracted data for each continuous outcome included: mean (or median), standard deviation (and/or standard error), and 95 percent confidence interval (95 percent CI). For dichotomous outcomes, proportions and corresponding 95 percent CIs were abstracted. Primary efficacy/effectiveness outcomes that were abstracted were: pain intensity (e.g., Visual Analog Scale-VAS, Numerical Rating Scale-NRS, McGill Pain Questionnaire-MPQ, Von Korff Chronic Pain Grade Scale), function (Hannover Functional Ability Questionnaire-HFAQ) and disability (e.g., Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire-RMDQ: 0-24, Northwick Park Neck Pain Oswestry of Living-ADL, Index-NDI: 0-50, and Pain Disability Index-PDI) well being/quality of life (e.g., EQ-5D, SF-36 physical functioning or pain domains), global perceived effect (GPE), work related outcomes (e.g., work absenteeism, sick leave), and conventional health care utilization (e.g., number of visits to health care services, intake of pain medications). Secondary efficacy/effectiveness outcomes considered for abstraction included spinal range of motion (ROM; flexibility, extension, rotation), straight leg raise (SLR), finger floor distance (FFD), and muscle strength. The timing of post-treatment followup for each outcome was ascertained and then categorized into four groups: immediate, short- (< 3 months), intermediate-(3 months to 12 months), and long-term (> 12 months) post-treatment followup. 22 For cost-effectiveness analysis, the following data was extracted: a) costs in the health care sector, b) costs of production loss, c) costs in other sectors, d) patient and family costs, and e) total costs. Any data on harms was also abstracted (i.e., proportion of patients with at least one event). We considered the following harms outcomes: any adverse events, serious adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events, and specific adverse events (e.g., increase in pain, bruising, local bleeding, infection, punctured organs, swelling, allergies, cauda-equina syndrome). Assessment of Study Quality and Reporting The risk of bias for RCTs was assessed using the criteria list recommended in the Updated Method Guidelines for Systematic Reviews in the Cochrane Collaboration Back Review Group.8 The tool is shown in Appendix F. For each study, a criterion was rated as \"yes\", \"no\" or \"don't know\". The quality of individual studies were classified into three groups (i.e., good, fair, and poor), depending on the number of 'Yes' ratings across the following four domains (questions 2, 3, 4, and 9 of risk of bias tool): a) treatment allocation concealment (selection domain), b) balance of baseline characteristics between the groups (selection domain), c) patients' blinding status to the intervention they received (blinding domain), and d) number/reasons for dropouts/withdrawals (attrition domain). For example, studies with scores of 0-1, 2-3, and 4 (i.e., number of 'yes' ratings on four domains) were classified as having poor, fair, and good quality, respectively. To explore overall bias, we constructed risk-of-bias graphs that are presented in the Results sections. 8 Studies of other designs were assessed using the modified tool suggested by Downs and Black.9 The items of this tool cover the following constructs: selection of study population, comparability of study groups (important confounders controlled for through either matching and/or adjusting in the analysis), and ascertainment of outcomes (independent blind assessment, sufficient length of followup). Additionally, methodological quality of the included economic studies was determined using the CHEC list. This list consists of 19 items for the assessment of the quality of economic evaluations conducted alongside randomized clinical trials that were selected in a Delphi process by 23 experts in the field of health economics (see Appendix F). 10 Rating the Strength of Evidence We assessed the overall strength of evidence using the approach of grading system suggested by the Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) program of the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). 11 This system is largely based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) working group approach. 12 The evidence grading method consists of four major domains: 1) risk of bias (aggregate measure of the overall quality or degree of bias of study/studies for a given outcome or comparison), 2) consistency (the degree to which results of studies for a given outcome or comparison are uniform in terms of effect direction and statistical significance), 3) directness (whether or not the interventions were compared in head-to-head trials; ultimate health outcomes 23 versus surrogate outcomes), and 4) precision (the degree of variability/uncertainty around the pooled effect estimate). The overall quality of evidence (risk-of-bias) for a given outcome was derived from the quality scores of individual study or studies (poor, fair, or good) and was categorized in three groups (high, medium, or low). If evidence consisted of only one study (or multiple studies of the same quality rating), then the study quality corresponded to risk-of-bias for this evidence in the following manner: study quality (poor) = risk-of-bias (high), study quality (fair) = risk-of\u00adbias (medium), and study quality (good) = risk-of-bias (low). In case of evidence consisting of multiple studies with different quality ratings (studies of poor, fair, and good quality mixed together), the mean quality score (i.e., mean number of 'Yes') was calculated. Evidence with mean quality score < 2 was labeled as having high risk of bias, 2 \u0094 mean quality score < 4 was labeled as having medium risk of bias, and the mean quality score of 4 was labeled as low risk of bias. The relationship between the risk of bias for evidence and mean quality score based on individual study (or studies) is presented in Table 1. Table 1. Study quality and risk-of-bias Quality score* Study Quality Risk of Bias 0 \u0094 N < 2 Poor High 2 \u0094 N < 4 Fair Medium N = 4 Good Low * Number of 'Yes' on 4 domains; in case of a single study, N is a whole number (0, 1, 2, 3, 4); in case of multiple studies, N is a mean number which may be whole number or fraction Depending on ratings for four domains (risk of bias, consistency, directness, and precision), the grade of evidence was high, moderate, low, or insufficient (Table 2). The initial high grade was reduced by one level (from high to moderate; from moderate to low grade) for each of the domains not met: risk of bias (medium), consistency (inconsistent, single trial-not applicable), precision (imprecise), and directness (indirect). The grade was reduced by two levels from high to low in case of high risk of bias. Although we ascertained and presented ratings for 'precision' in the tables for specific outcomes, we did not downgrade the strength of evidence based on this domain simply due to the absence of a pooled estimate and 95 percent confidence intervals. The absence of evidence was graded as 'insufficient'. Results were considered consistent when statistically significant or nonsignificant effects in the same direction were observed across trials. The pooled estimate with relatively narrow range of effect sizes (95 percent confidence intervals) with clear direction leading to clinically uniform conclusion was considered as 'precise evidence'. Clinical outcomes such as pain, disability or function, quality of life, proportion of subjects who improved, time to (or duration of) analgesic effect, and use of analgesics were considered as 'direct evidence'. Other measures such as range of motion (ROM), pressure pain threshold (PPT), utilization of conventional healthcare system (e.g., general practitioner visits, imaging studies), sick leave (e.g., length, proportion of subjects), and proportion of subjects cured were considered as 'indirect evidence'. The grading results for strength of evidence are presented throughout the Results section (Chapter 3, Tables 5, 7, 9, 12, 13, 15, 17, 19, and 21). For reasons of brevity, these tables do not include trials comparing benefits/harms of CAM treatments combined with other therapies (except for manipulation plus mobilization in experimental arm), or trials comparing different modalities of the CAM treatments (manipulation daily versus manipulation weekly; deep acupuncture versus superficial acupuncture). The graded evidence is presented in the results section. (Chapter 3) 24 Table 2.Grading of evidence Grade Domain High All 4 domains are met (e.g., low risk of bias, precise, direct, consistent) Moderate 1 of the domains is not met (e.g., medium risk of bias, precise, direct, consistent) Low 2-4 of the domains are not met (e.g., high risk of bias, precise, indirect, inconsistent) Insufficient No evidence/absence of evidence Evidence Synthesis and Analysis The results (both quantitative and qualitative parts) of this review were grouped according to a type of experimental intervention (e.g., acupuncture, manipulation, mobilization, massage), pain location in spinal region (low back, neck, head, thorax), duration of pain (acute/sub-acute, chronic, mixed, unknown), and cause of pain (specific versus nonspecific). The results of all analyses for any given outcome (e.g., pain, global measure, function, disability, harms, medication use) were presented within subgroups defined by location, duration, and cause of pain, and were presented separately with respect to control intervention (e.g., no treatment, placebo, other CAM treatment, medication, other treatment) and timing of outcome ascertainment during post-treatment followup (immediate, short-, intermediate-, and long-term). Qualitative Analysis For each study, information on sample size, demographics (e.g., age, gender, race), settings (e.g., population-based, primary care, hospital), treatments (type, dose, frequency, and experience of the caregiver), outcomes (e.g., pain, disability, function, medication use), and source of funding (e.g., industry, government) were summarized in text and/or summary tables. The results of one or more trials that compared two or more treatments with respect to change in any given outcome were summarized in text as well as in numerous tables. (Refer to Chapter 3). Quantitative Analysis The decision to pool individual study results was based on clinical judgment with regards to comparability of study populations, treatments, and outcome measures. We considered studies suitable for pooling if they used the same design (RCT), enrolled similar populations (e.g., chronic specific neck pain), evaluated the same types of treatments (e.g., acupuncture versus placebo; manipulation versus no treatment), and reported the same outcomes measured with identical scale and ascertained in similar post-treatment followup periods (e.g., pain intensity on VAS immediately after the treatment). The meta-analyses of pain were based on 1-10 visual analogue scale. We used DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models to generate pooled estimates of relative risks (RRs) and weighted between-group end point mean differences (WMDs) with 95 percent CIs. 13 Statistical heterogeneity was evaluated using a chi-square test did not report summary statistics (e.g., mean score, standard deviation, standard error) adequately, we calculated the needed parameters if data for individual patients were reported. If a study reported only a standard error of the mean response, we converted it to a standard deviation. Trials were not incorporated into meta-analyses if the needed data (e.g., 25 mean and standard deviation) could not be derived. Trials with obvious between-group baseline imbalances in the outcome were not pooled unless the mean change from baseline and corresponding SDs for the compared study groups were reported. If data allowed, the statistically significant pooled estimates of post-treatment pain intensity and disability were planned to be examined in order to determine the degree of clinical importance for the observed differences between the treatment groups. The assessment of the degree of clinical importance was based on the criteria from the updated methods guideline for systematic reviews suggested by the Cochrane Back Review Group which were defined as small (WMD < 10 percent of the VAS or a disability scale), medium (10 percent \u0094 WMD < 20 percent of the VAS or a disability scale), and large (WMD \u0095 20 percent of the VAS or a disability scale). 14 We examined the extent of publication bias through visual inspection of funnel plot asymmetry with respect to contours of statistical significance (Moreno et al. 2009)15 and the Egger's regression-based method.16 Subgroup and Sensitivity Analyses We planned to conduct subgroup and sensitivity analyses to explore statistical heterogeneity, if the collected data allowed. The a priori defined population subgroups were based on patient-specific factors (age, gender, race, education, comorbidity). Trial-specific factors were study quality (risk-of-bias) and type of treatment provider. To explore the impact of study quality on the pooled effect estimate between two treatments, trials were categorized into two groups: 'higher risk-of-bias' and 'lower risk-of-bias.' If for a trial, seven or more items of the risk-of-bias tool were rated as 'Yes' this trial was categorized into 'lower risk-of-bias' group, otherwise into 'higher risk-of-bias' group. Afterwards, the pooled treatment effect estimates across the two strata of trials with 'lower risk-of-bias' and 'higher risk-of-bias' were compared in terms of their effect size, direction, statistical significance, and 95 percent CI. We performed all analyses using R software, version 2.4.0 ( www.r-project.org ). 26 Chapter 3. Results Literature Search Results The original (Oct. 2008) and updated (Feb. 2010) search of MEDLINE, and all other sources (including expert nominated records) for primary studies yielded 10,505 citations. After removing 3,783 duplicate records, titles and abstracts of 6,756 records were screened. Of these, 1,339 were potentially relevant records. We were able to retrieve full text articles for 1,167 records. The remaining 172 records were not further screened since full texts for them could not be obtained. In total, 811 records did not meet eligibility criteria applied during the full text screening, and therefore were excluded (Appendix D); thus a total of 356 records were included in this report. Of these 356 records, only 33 were quantitatively analyzed. Figure 2 outlines the study flow process for this review. 27 Figure 2. PRISMA chart for study retrieval and selection 28 General Characteristics of the Included Studies Of the 356 included records, 86 were identified as multiple publications of the primary studies. In this review, multiple publication is defined as a single study results published more than once, or part of data from an original report was republished separately. In general, a publication that provided the most comprehensive report of the original trial was used as the primary study. If multiple publications included the same data, the report published earlier was regarded as the main study. The publication date of primary studies ranged from 1976 to 2009. The included records were published in English (273), Chinese (72), German (10), Japanese (nine), Spanish (one), and Italian (one) language. In total, 270 unique studies were included in this report. Table 3 outlines the included original and secondary publications. Of the 270 primary studies, 265 were RCTs and five were cohort or case-control studies. The CAM interventions in the 265 RCTs (351 publications) were acupuncture (155 trials), spinal manipulation (66 trials), spinal mobilization (29 trials), spinal manipulation + mobilization (11 trials), and massage (33). There were few studies in which both regions of pain, or more than one CAM interventions were studied. Ten trials of economic evaluation of CAM treatments were also included. Table 3.

The risk of bias was assessed for 242 studies. The remaining RCTs were reported in abstract form and were not suitable for this assessment. Overall, the metrological quality of the RCTs were poor (median score = 5/13; Inter-quartile range: 3, 7). Only 94 (39 percent) of the studies scored six or higher from the total of 13 items of risk of bias tool. We found that 99 (41 percent) studies described an adequate method of randomization. The remaining studies either did not report the method used for randomization (7.0 percent) or the method used was not clearly described (52.0 percent). Concealment of treatment allocation was judged as adequate in 21.1 percent of RCTs and inadequate in 10.3 percent. More information on rating of risk of bias is provided in Table 4 and Appendix G. 30 Table 4. Risk of bias assessment of RCTs Quality components N studies (%) Adequate method of randomization 99 (40.9%) Adequate method of allocation concealment 51 (21.1%) Similarity at baseline regarding the most important prognostic indicators 158 (65.3%) Appropriate patient blinding to the intervention 43 (17.8%) Appropriate care provider blinding to the intervention 7 (2.9%) Appropriate outcome assessor blinding to the intervention 85 (35.1%) Similar or no cointerventions between groups 103 (42.6%) Acceptable compliance in all groups 82 (33.9%) Described and acceptable drop-out rates 132 (54.5%) Similarity of timing of the outcome assessment in all groups 214 (88.4%) Inclusion of an intention-to-treat analysis 84 (34.7%) Absence of selective outcome reporting 127 (52.5%) Absence of other potential bias 12 (5.0%) Total Risk of Bias scores (max 13); median (IQR) 5 (3, 7) RCTs reporting economic evaluation. Three studies collected costs appropriate to their chosen perspective. Two studies did not state the perspective adopted for the economic evaluation. Most studies measured costs using diaries, questionnaires, or practice or insurance records, and valued costs appropriately using published sources. Where appropriate, most studies conducted an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis. The length of followup for all of the studies was at least 1 year. In one study whose length of followup was more than 1 year, discounting was undertaken. Appendix G - Tables 5.1 & 5.2 shows the results of the assessment of the quality of the economic evaluations. Controlled observational studies (cohort, case-control). Assessment of quality of reporting in observational studies was done by using the modified Downs and Black tool. In general, the objective, and the main outcome of the studies were well described and the studies were of large sample size providing sufficient power to detect clinically important effects. Detail information could be found in Appendix G, table 6.1. Risk of bias of RCTs by CAM intervention. In this review the results are presented for CAM interventions for treatment of low back pain, thoracic pain, and neck pain. For each of these pain regions, the CAM interventions are organized by the following order: x Acupuncture x Spinal manipulation x Flexion distraction technique (only for LBP) x Spinal mobilization x Spinal manipulation + mobilization x Massage Summary of the results of risk of bias assessment for these CAM interventions within each pain region (LBP, NP) is presented in the respective sections of the results (Figures 3, 24, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 42, 43, and 47). Here we attempted to compare the risk of bias in the included studies across the five CAM interventions. The summary of findings regarding the most relevant items of risk of bias are outlined in Table 5. In summary, the items related to randomization, concealment of treatment allocation, differences in baseline prognostic indicators, blinding of outcome assessor, imbalance in use of cointervention, reporting of intention to treat analysis, and 31 selected outcome reporting bias was the focus of this comparison. As judged by median and inter quartile ranges of total score (13 items), trials in manual therapies of LBP had slightly lower risk of bias (median 7, 8, and 6 for spinal mobilization, manipulation + mobilization, and massage, respectively) with the exception of manipulation therapy (median score = 2, IQR 1, 3) compared with acupuncture (median score = 4, IQR 1, 3). In the trials on treatment of neck pain, there was no difference in the total scores (median scores = 4, 3, 3, and 5 for acupuncture, manipulation, mobilization, and massage, respectively). 32 Table 5.

Three trials included only male and three trials included only female participants. Nine trials included older adults aged 55 and older. Acupuncture. In total, 15,187 participants were included in the LBP and NP trials. The largest trial was conducted in Germany and included a total of 3,093 participants with chronic nonspecific low back pain. This trial reported efficacy and cost effectiveness and is discussed in detail in respective sections of the review. In 97 trials, subjects had nonspecific pain and in the remaining 91 trials subjects had specific pain. Ninety-two trials enrolled subjects with identified or specific cause of pain such as disc perturbation, whiplash, cervicogenic headache, or underlying neurological causes. Details of these conditions can be found in Tables 1.1 - 1.8 (low back pain) and 2.1- 2.8 (neck pain) in Appendix C, and throughout the results section. Manual treatments (spinal manipulation, mobilization and combined treatment). In total, 22,638 subjects were included in 100 trials. The majority of these trials (90 trials) included subjects with nonspecific pain. Details of these conditions can be found in Tables 1.9 - 1.34 (low back pain) and 2.9- 2.18 (neck pain) in Appendix C, and throughout the results section. Massage. In total, 4,050 subjects were included in 35 trials for treatment of LBP or NP. In 24 of the trials, subjects had nonspecific pain and in the remaining 11 trials subjects had specific pain (whiplash, myofascial pain, and other causes). Details of these conditions can be found in Tables 1.35 - 1.40 (low back pain) and 2.19- 2.26 (neck pain) in Appendix C, and throughout the results section. Interventions and Control Treatments Acupuncture. In 155 acupuncture trials, a large variety of methods of acupuncture treatments were used to compare the effect of acupuncture versus control treatments. The control treatments in these trials included active (i.e. physical modalities and exercise) or inactive treatments (i.e. placebo, no treatment). Details of treatment techniques and controls used can be found in Tables 1.1 - 1.8 (low back pain) and 2.1- 2.8 (neck pain) in Appendix C. The treatment providers for acupuncture trials were trained or licensed acupuncturists (27 trials), general practitioners or physicians with especial training in acupuncture (41 trials), neuropathy physicians (nine trials), general practitioners (five trials), and trained physiotherapists (four trials). In the majority of foreign language publications, particularly in Chinese trials, the treatment provider was referred as \"therapist\" (17 trials). The information about treatment provider was not reported for 85 trials. Specific details about treatment providers, years of experience (when reported), treatment duration, and outcomes assessed in each trial are presented in Appendix I. Manual treatment (spinal manipulation, mobilization and combined treatment). In total, 101 primary trials used techniques of manipulation, mobilization or combination of both for treatment of low back, thoracic and neck pain. The details of treatment techniques and control interventions (active and inactive) used in these trials can be found in Tables 1.9 - 1.34 (low back pain) and 2.9- 2.18 (neck pain) in Appendix C. In 32 trials, spinal manipulation or mobilization was provided by experienced and licensed chiropractors. In the remaining studies manipulation or mobilization was provided by phys ical therapists (17 trials), general 34 practitioners (five trials), licensed or qualified manual therapy practitioners (six trials), physical therapists with manual therapy training (three trials), clinicians or experienced clinicians (four trials), neurologists or rheumatologists with chiropractic training (three trials), folk healers (one trial), and osteopaths (one trial). The information regarding treatment provider was not reported for the remaining 29 trials. Specific details about treatment providers, years of experience (when reported), treatment duration, and outcome assessed in each trial, are presented in Appendix I. Massage. In total, 35 studies used massage for treatment of LBP, or NP. Details of treatment techniques and control interventions (active and inactive) used in these trials can be found in Tables 1.35 - 1.40 (low back pain) and 2.19- 2.26 (neck pain) in Appendix C. In eight trials, treatment providers were licensed or experienced massage therapists. In the remaining trials, treatment of massage was provided by physical therapists (five trials), reflexologists, acupressure therapists, folk healers (four trials), general pr actitioners (four trials), manual therapists (two trials), experienced bone setters (one trial), and chiropractic students (one trial). For the remaining 10 trials, the information on treatment providers was not reported. Specific details about treatment providers, years of experience (when reported), treatment duration, and outcome assessed for each trial are presented in Appendix I. 35 KQ1. What is the Efficacy, Effectiveness and Cost- effectiveness of the Most Prevalent Types of Practitioner- based Manual CAM Therapies Compared to Other CAM Therapies, Conventional Therapies, Placebo, no Treatment, or Wait List in Improving Outcomes in Patients With Nonspecific and Certain Specific Types of Back and Neck Pain? Efficacy & Effectiveness 1 - Acupuncture for Treatment of Low Back Pain We included 105 trials in this section. Results of 15 trials were reported in multiple publications (Table 3). Population/trial characteristics. The studies were conducted in Australia (four)52,140-142, Austria (one)143, Canada (two)144,145, China (two)27,222, UK (three)53,110,223, and United States (eight)29,49,88,224-228. The proportions of men and women were similar in 46 studies (40 percent - 60 percent). In 14 studies there were a greater proportion of men (> 60 percent) and in 15 studies women were the majority (> 60 percent). One study recruited only women,219 and another one only men.144 In six studies the proportion of men and women between the arms was not similar.140,197,209,209,218,228 The majority of trials (94 percent) recruited general adult age population (18 - 60 years old). Seven studies recruited only elderly subjects (60 years or older).53,207,208,216,217,226,227 Information on racial composition or ethnicity was reported for six studies.29,110,198,224,226,228 The Asian trials (72 studies) did not report the racial composition and was assumed to be 100 percent Asian. In total 15,162 participants with LBP were randomized to acupuncture or control groups. The sample size in these trials varied from nine 217 to 284124 participants. In the majority of trials (90 percent), acupuncture (various methods of needling techniques including electro-acupuncture) was used alone (95 studies), whereas in the remaining trials, it was used in combination with 'other treatments' (11 studies). 99,144,158,161,172,185,193,198,200,216,226 The comparison arm in these trials was the same 'other treatment.'

The frequency of treatments in most studies was once a day consecutively for the duration of the study course. The number of acupuncture treatments across the studies was fewer than 10, 160,168,170,181 10 - 20,138,149,153,162-164,166,167,171,174-177,194,197 and 21 - 45.134,150,184,190 The number of treatments in Chinese studies varied. Three of these studies did not report this information. 156,180,195 The frequency of treatment in the remaining studies that reported this data were the following: One treatment, 49,206,210,212,213,218,225 One to two sessions per week (up to 18 treatments in total),22,24,37,52,88,121,121,136,140-142,144,145,155,160,199,202,205,208,209,211,211,214,214,217,222,224,228,233 three sessions per week (up to 15 treatments in total),151,197,200,201,207,207,219 four sessions per week (12 treatments in total),99 and five sessions per week (up to 21 treatments in total).150,163,198,226 Risk of bias. The risk-of-bias graph for the trials included in this sub-section is presented in Figure 3. All trials were randomized. The adequate method of randomization and treatment allocation concealment was reported for about 44.0 percent and 20.0 percent of the trials, respectively. In 68.0 percent of the trials, the subjects' baseline characteristics distribution across the treatment arms was similar (i.e., balanced). In one trial, 53 the baseline distribution of VAS score was higher in the acupuncture versus TENS group (140 versus 101). For at least half of the trials, it was unclear whether or not the subjects and assessors were blinded to the type of treatment. About 47.0 percent of the trials reported acceptable drop-out rate. In one trial,140 the 38 drop out rate in acupuncture group was very high (52.0 percent). Results based on intention-to\u00ad treat analysis were explicitly reported for about 30.0 percent of the trials. The data for selected items of the risk of bias tool across the CAM interventions (acupuncture; spinal manipulation; spinal mobilization; combination of manipulation and mobilization; and massage therapy) is displayed in table 7.1 of Appendix G.

There were nine trials of patients with acute or subacute LBP included in this sub-section.152,160,167-169,202,212,220,224 Of these, five trials studied patients with nonspecific LBP167,202,212,220,224 and four trials - patients with LBP due to disc protrusion or lumbar sprain.152,160,168,169 Subjects with specific pain. Acupuncture versus placebo . No relevant studies were identified. Acupuncture versus no treatment. No relevant studies were identified. Acupuncture (type 1) versus acupuncture (type 2). In three trials, different modalities of electro-acupuncture (local single-point versus conventional)160 and acupuncture Cleft versus conventional needling;169 warming needle moxibustion versus conventional needling152) were compared in treating subjects with LBP due to disc protrusion. In all three trials, experimental treatment modalities (local single-point electro-stimulation, needling Xi- Cleft points, and needle warming moxibustion) were shown to be more effective than conventional acupuncture (or electro-acupuncture) in improving immediate post-treatment pain (VAS score, therapeutic effect - the absence of pain) or disability (Oswestry Disability Index score). 152,160,169 In one trial,168 in subjects with pain due to lumbar sprain, needling at Yanglao (S16) was associated with a numerically higher response rate (percent subjects free of lumbar pain with tenderness relieved by 80.0 percent, lumbar flexion 110\u00b0, extension 30\u00b0, free and at paravertebral or Ashi acu-points (94.4 percent versus 69.7 percent, p < 0.01). In the same trial, earlier administration of treatment tended to produce better response rates irrespective of the type of acupuncture. No pain intensity or disability outcomes were reported. Acupuncture versus other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Acupuncture versus medication. In one trial, 220 there was no difference immediately, short- term, or intermediate-term after the end of treatment between acupuncture and Naproxen 500 mg, taken twice daily for 10 days, in measures of pain (VAS). Acupuncture + other treatments versus the same other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Subjects with nonspecific pain. Acupuncture versus placebo . The effects of acupuncture and placebo (nonpenetrating needling, or guided tube) were compared in two trials. 202,212 Although in the first trial,202 immediately or 3 months after the treatment subjects in the acupuncture group had numerically improved degree of disability (RMDQ score) and pain (mean VAS score: 1-100) compared to subjects who received placebo (sham acupuncture), these differences were not statistically significant due to a low power of this trial (RMDQ score difference at 3 months: 2.6, 95 percent CI: -0.7, 5.9 and VAS score difference at 3 months: 10.6, 95 percent CI: -4.1, 25.3). In the same trial, at the end of treatment, subjects randomized to acupuncture were taking significantly fewer pain medication tablets for LBP compared to those in the placebo-treated group (1.0 \u00b1 0.3 versus 4.2 \u00b1 0.6, p < 0.05). In the other trial, 212 acupuncture, compared to placebo, was associated with a nonsignificantly lower pain intensity VAS score (49.9 \u00b1 22.2 versus 51.8 \u00b1 26.1, p > 0.05). Acupuncture versus no treatment. No relevant studies were identified. Acupuncture versus another type/method of the same CAM. No relevant studies were identified. 47 Acupuncture versus other treatments. In one trial,224 the addition of patients' choice for acupuncture to usual care did not improve the degree of disability (RMDQ score) compared to usual care alone immediately, shortly, or intermediate-term post-treatment. Acupuncture versus medication. No relevant studies were identified. Acupuncture (type 1) versus acupuncture (type 2) . The combination of acupuncture, pricking collateral, cupping, and moxibustion was shown to be associated with greater improvement in complete curative effect (i.e., complete relief of the severe pain and positive symptoms, recovery of motility and other functions, and ability to en gage in normal work and life) compared to acupuncture alone or combined with cupping. 167 Population with chronic pain. A total of 42 trials were included in this section, the majority of which studied subjects with nonspecific LBP (36 studies).22,24,27,29,37,52,53,88,99,136,140\u00ad 143,155,156,163,174,197,198,200,203,204,206,207,211,213,214,216,217,222,223,225-228 The remaining six trials included subjects with LBP due to specific causes (e.g., myofascial pain syndrome, spondylitis, disc protrusion, sciatica, injuries/fractures). 144,162,201,205,208,221 Subjects with specific pain. Acupuncture versus placebo . One trial compared the effects of electro-acupuncture and placebo (sham TENS) on the reduction of pain intensity in subjects with sciatica.201 The use of electro-acupuncture was significantly more effective in reducing pain or sciatica at short term followup compared to placebo. Acupuncture versus no treatment. No relevant studies were identified. Acupuncture versus another type/method of the same CAM. No relevant studies were identified. Acupuncture versus other treatments. One trial compared the effects of electro-acupuncture to that of physiotherapy (hot packs, ultrasound, short wave diathermy, TENS, muscle stretching) in subjects with sciatica. 201 The use of electro-acupuncture was found to be clinically and significantly more beneficial in reducing short-term post-treatment pain compared to physiotherapy 201 Acupuncture versus medication. In one trial,221 the use of electro-acupuncture in patients with herniated lumbar disc was shown to be significantly beneficial in reducing pain intensity immediately after the treatment compared to 50 mg diclofenic (mean VAS, 1-100: 25.7 \u00b1 2.3 versus 33.3 \u00b1 2.5, p < 0.05). Acupuncture (type 1) versus acupuncture (type 2) . In two trials, different needling techniques were compared in subjects with spondylitis , and lumbar strain (soft tissue injury), 162 or myofascial pain syndrome.205 In the first study,162 for the subgroup of patients with lumbar strain (soft-tissue injury) dermal needling was better than only acupuncture. For the subgroup of patients with hyperplastic spondylitis, body acupuncture was better than dermal needling. 162 In the other study,205 in-depth needling205 had significantly better analgesic effect at 3 months followup compared to superficial needling in patients with myofascial pain syndrome. This beneficial effect was not apparent at the end of 8 treatment sessions. In one additional trial, 208 standard, deep, and superficial needling modalities applied to the trigger points were compared (insertion depth: 20 mm, 23 mm, 3 mm, respectively) with respect to immediate post-treatment reductions in pain intensity (VAS: 1-100) and disability (RMDQ scores) in elderly subjects with spondylosis, osteoporosis, or trauma. Although there was a numerical preponderance in favor of deep needling for pain intensity, the observed between-group differences were not statistically significant (VAS: 56.8 \u00b1 25.1 versus 44.4 \u00b1 19.1 versus 48 50.1 \u00b1 32.5, p > 0.05). The mean RMDQ disability score was similar across the groups (4.2 \u00b1 4.3 versus 4.2 \u00b1 1.2 versus 4.3 \u00b1 2.2).208 In one trial of higher risk of bias (20 patients), 211 distal point needling for low-back pain of any duration was no different from local lumbar area needling for measures of pain, function and range of motion. Subjects with nonspecific pain. Acupuncture versus placebo . The effects of acupuncture and placebo were compared in 16 trials. 22,27,37,88,99,141,142,156,197,198,203,206,207,213,223,228 The results of these trials were conflicting. In nine trials,27,88,99,156,206,207,213,223,228 acupuncture was significantly better than placebo in reducing pain intensity (VAS scores, percent subjects with improved pain or with relief \u0095 50 percent)27,88,99,206,207,223 or disability levels (RMDQ scores)207,228 immediately or shortly after the end of treatment. For example, in one trial,156 Fu's subcutaneous needling was compared to placebo (sham-acupuncture) with respect to post-treatment reduction in motion-related pain (MRP score) and pain under pressure (PUP)., Fu's subcutaneous needling compared to placebo produced significantly greater immediate post-treatment reductions on both MRP (2.66 \u00b1 2.42 versus \u00b1 2.39 versus 0.36 \u00b1 0.99). The placebo treatments used in these trials were toothpick inside the tube, 228 sham TENS,27,88,223 nonpenetrating needling,206,207 superficial needling at nonacupuncture points,99 and guided tube. 156,213 In contrast, results from six other trials indicated that acupuncture was not significantly better than placebo in reducing back pain (VAS scores: 0-100, modified MPQ, Von Korff Chronic Pain Grade Scale: disability (PDI, HFAQ), or improving quality of life (SF-12 physical score) immediately or shortly (3 months) after the end of treatment. 37,141,142,197,198,203 For example, in one of these trials 141 although immediate mean post-treatment VAS score was numerically lower in the acupuncture versus placebo group, the between-group difference was not statistically significant (30.2 \u00b1 3.0 versus 40.0 \u00b1 3.8, p > 0.6). The degree of pain measured by MPQ also yielded nonsignificant between-group difference. In general, the use of analgesic medication and degree of disability (scale not specified) decreased, but did not differ between the two groups. The placebo used in these trials were superficial needling with injection of Lidocaine at nonacupuncture points, 141 superficial needling at nonacupuncture points,198,203 superficial needling 37, and injection of anesthetics and no stimulation.142 The placebo was not described for one trial.197 Moreover, in one trial,22 immediately after the end of treatment, acupuncture produced significantly greater improvements in pain (VAS scores: 34.5 versus 43.7, p = 0.03) and quality of life (SF-36 physical health domain: 40.5 versus 36.2, p < 0.004) compared to placebo, the differences in pain (VAS score: 38.4 versus 42.1, p = 0.39) and quality of life (SF-36 physical health domain: 39.3 versus 37.6, p = 0.27) were no more significant at four and 10 months post\u00adtreatment followup. 22 The effects of acupuncture and placebo TENS were compared in two trials,27,203 in one of which acupuncture was shown to be similar to placebo-TENS in terms of pain relief (MPQ, VAS scores) or quality of life (SF-36),203 while the other trial27 showed that in short term post-treatment reduction in pain (VAS scores) was significantly greater in the acupuncture versus placebo-TENS group. There was no significant difference in pain intensity between the two groups at 4 months after the end of treatment (p = 0.12). The meta-analyses indicated statistically significant pooled mean differences between the effects of acupuncture and placebo in reducing pain intensity (VAS scores) immediately (-0.59, 95 percent CI: -0.93, -0.25). 22,37,99,141,156,197,198,203,206,228 (Figure percent CI: -0.85, 0.49),22,27,228 49 Figure 4.

Subjects who received manipulation,51,52,140 massage,29 or electro-acupuncture143 had significantly lower post-treatment pain intensity (VAS, MPQ scores) or disability (RDI, Oswestry, NDI scores) compared to subjects who received manual acupuncture. However, results from intermediate-term followup (3 months post\u00adtreatment) of one of these trials 51,52 indicated numerically similar pain intensity in the manipulation group (median VAS score: 3.7) compared with acupuncture group (median VAS score: 3.9). The use of pain medication was significantly decreased in electro-acupuncture group compared to manual acupuncture group (six tablets versus 150 tablets, p < 0.001). 143 In another trial,29 the use of pain medication did not differ in the acupuncture versus massage group (51.0 percent versus 47.0 percent, p > 0.05). The meta-analysis comparing the effects of acupuncture and manipulation on immediate post-treatment pain intensity (Figure 15) indicated significant reductions in favor of manipulation over acupuncture (pooled mean difference in VAS score: 3.70, 95 percent CI: 1.5, 5.8). 51,140 Although both trials51,140 reported immediate-term post-treatment disability data (Oswestry scores), they were not pooled due to obvious between-group baseline imbalance in this outcome scores. 55 Figure 15.

The effect of acupuncture compared to usual care (e.g., pain medication, antiinflammatory pills, general practitioner visits, exercise, and lifestyle modifications) was studied in three trials.37,226,228 In these trials subjects who received acupuncture improved in pain intensity, degree of disability, or quality of life compared to subjects in usual care groups. 37,226,228 Acupuncture versus medication. The effect of acupuncture was compared to that of medication in four trials.51,140,214,216 In three studies51,52,140,216 acupuncture did not have a significantly different effect from that of medication in reducing immediate, or short term post\u00adtreatment pain intensity or disability (RMDQ, Oswestry score). In one of these trials 51,52 acupuncture group achieved numerically better median Oswestry disability score than medication (13 versus 24) in intermediate term post treatment followup. This trial failed to report test results for between-group comparisons. In two meta-analyses (Figures 16-17) the immediate post-treatment effects of acupuncture and medication were not significantly different with respect to reductions in pain intensity (pooled mean difference in VAS score: 0.11, 95 percent CI: -1.42, 1.65) 51,140,216,221 and disability score: -2.40, 95 percent CI: -12.20, 7.40).51,140 56 Disability (Oswestry score) - Immediate post-treatment Differ Differe en nc ce in means e in means a and nd 9 95 5% % CI CI S St tu ud dy N y Na am me e N N M Me ea an n ( ( S SD D) )A Ac cupu upun nc cture ture N N M Mea ean n ( (S SD D) )Me Med di ic ca at ti ion on Fav Favo ors rs A Ac cu up pun unc ct tur ure eFav Favo ors rs Me Med di ic ca at ti io on n G Gi il le es s e et t a al l, , 19 1999 99 G Gi il le es s e et t a al l, , 20 2003 03 Po Pool ole ed d16 1633 33 49 492 24 4. .5 5 ( (2 26. 6.6) 6) 2 26 6.0 .0 ( (2 20.7) 0.7)20 2035 35 5 55 52 20 0. .0 0 ( (2 21. 1.5) 5) 32 32. .0 0 (2 (23 3. .7 7) ) 4.5 (-11.2, 20.2) -6.0 (P = 0.27); I2 = 15.3% Figure 18.

Another trial,216 demonstrated statistically significantly greater immediate post\u00ad treatment improvements for subjects treated with combination of acupuncture and TENS compared to those treated with acupuncture alone with respect to pain intensity (VAS: 36.6 \u00b1 8.0 versus 37.4 \u00b1 26.0, p < 0.008) and disability (RMDQ: 3.8 \u00b1 0.8 versus 5.4 \u00b1 3.4). In two trials, subjects in electro-acupuncture groups had significantly lower post-treatment pain intensity scores (VAS, Numerical Rating Scale of Pain-NPRS) 88,155 or increased trunk strength extension88 compared with subjects who received TENS88 or exercise sessions.155 Acupuncture + other treatment versus other treatment. There were five trials,99,198,200,216,226 in which both acupuncture and control (i.e., no treatment) groups were given either orthopaedic treatment, 99 usual care (e.g., NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, Paracetamol, and back exercises),226 TENS,216 exercise,200or physiotherapy (method use was aimed to remove a muscle imbalance using the Bruegger-concept and special training of proper posture and motion)198 The addition of acupuncture to the above-mentioned therapies resulted in significant improvements in pain intensity (VAS mean scores) and disability (Pain Disability Index, Modified Roland Disability Score) compared to the control treatments (i.e., orthopaedic, usual care, or physiotherapy alone), immediately 99,198,226 or short-term99 after the end of treatment. In one of the trials,226 the patterns of pain medication use did not differ significantly between the acupuncture and control groups (p = 0.07). In one trial, 200 subjects receiving a combination of electro-acupuncture and exercise had significantly improved pain intensity (NRS scores), disability (Aberdeen Low Back Pain scale), and spinal angular ROM (flexion and extension) compared with subjects receiving exercise alone at 3 months post-treatment. The use of analgesics was similar across the two groups (p = 0.385). 200 In three meta-analyses (Figures 20-22) statistically significant differences in favor of combination of acupuncture with other treatment over other treatment were shown in the reduction of pain intensity immediately (pooled mean difference in VAS score: -1.65, 95 percent CI: -2.32, CI: -3.68, -0.79), -1.55, 95 percent CI: -2.29, -0.81)198,200 after the end of treatment. In one meta-analysis based on two studies in elderly (Figure 23), there was no statis tical significant differe nce in short-term post\u00ad treatment disability between the two intervention groups (pooled mean difference in RMDQ score: -3.15, 95 percent CI: -7.16, 0.87). 216,226 58 Figure 20.

In one trial,225 two modalities of needle insertion levels (muscle and overlying skin) were compared to electrical twitch-obtaining intramuscular stimulation (ETOIMS). Two weeks post-treatment, subjects in ETOIMS group had significantly lower mean VAS score (3.7 \u00b1 1.9) compared with those in subjects in the two other groups of muscle and skin stimulation (4.2 \u00b1 1.9 and 4.3 \u00b1 2.3, respectively). In two trials, 136,204 different weekly frequencies of acupuncture were compared (high - five times versus low - twice). In one of these trials,136 post-treatment pain intensity (VAS scores) and degree of disability (RMDQ scores) were similar in groups of subjects randomized to high frequency (1 year VAS score: 1.41, 95 percent CI: 0.58, 13.10, 95 percent 10.10, 16.11) versus low frequency (1 year VAS score: 1.35, 95 percent CI: 0.52, 2.18; 12.33, 14.31) at all points of post-treatment followup (5 weeks, 3 months, and 1 year). The immediate and delayed acupuncture treatments were compared in three trials showing subjects to have similar post-treatment pain intensity (VAS score) 22,24,227 or quality of life (SF\u00ad 36: physical and mental components).24 In one trial,217 two groups of subjects receiving trigger point acupuncture versus tender point acupuncture were compared with respect to pain intensity (VAS) and disability (RMDQ) 60 immediately after the treatment, showing significant improvements for both endpoints in the trigger point group compared to the tender point group. In another trial,155 subjects in the electro-acupuncture and electrical heat acupuncture groups had similar pain intensity (NPRS: 2.43 \u00b1 1.87 versus 2.27 \u00b1 2.15, p > 0.05) and disability degree (RMDQ: 5.93 \u00b1 3.79 versus 8.00 \u00b1 5.66, p > 0.05). In one trial, 174 patients with chronic LBP responded better to electroacupuncture at local points than to acupuncture at local point in addition to weizhong point (curative effect rate: 96.1 percent versus 88.7 percent, P < 0.05) at similar needle retention duration (30 minutes). Population with mixed duration of pain. A total of 44 trials with subjects having LBP of mixed duration were included in this section. 110,121,134,138,146-151,153,154,157,158,161,164-166,170-173,175,177\u00ad 185,187-195,209 The majority of these trials (39 studies) enrolled subjects with LBP due to specific causes (e.g., sciatica, disc protrusion, myofascial pain syndrome, lumbar transverse process syndrome, and spondylosis). 134,138,146-151,154,157-159,161,164-166,170-173,177-185,187-195,232 Only five trials studied subjects with nonspecific LBP.110,121,153,175,209 Subjects with specific pain. Acupuncture versus placebo. No relevant studies were identified. Acupuncture versus other treatment. In one trial, the use of electro-acupuncture was more effective in reducing pain and increasing range of motion (straight leg raising) than manual therapy (manipulation or mobilization) or oral medication,164 In two other trials, the combinations of warming needle and moxibustion produced significantly better results than acupuncture alone. 146,181 Acupuncture (type 1) versus acupuncture (type 2) . There were 23 trials conducted predominantly in Chinese subjects with lumbar intervertebral disc protrusion,148\u00ad 151,154,157,165,166,170,171,177-179,181-184,187,189,190,194,195 and myofascial pain,147which compared routine acupuncture (or electro-acupuncture) alone or in combination with other treatments (e.g., cupping, moxibustion, massage, traction, laser knife, hypodermic catgut embedding therapy, polarized light) to acupuncture of different modalities (e.g., abdomen-/body-acupuncture, round sharp/filiform needle, point-through-point, superficial needling, deep puncture), or needle-knife. Outcomes used in these studies were curative effect (definition varied across trials), VAS for pain intensity, 154,157,165,166,195 and well being.170,171,177,178,182,184,187,189,190,194,195 In four trials,149,165,178,183 deep or point-through-point needling produced significantly greater therapeutic effect (i.e., being free of pain symptoms) compared with conventional acupuncture. The use of round sharp needle, 194 contralateral needle,171 or along channel needle148 produced better therapeutic effect than conventional acupuncture. In two trials,179,187 abdominal acupuncture showed a significantly better effect compared with body acupuncture. Electro\u00adacupuncture was worse than hypodermic catgut as shown in one study. 182 Acupuncture versus other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Acupuncture versus medication. Elongated needling acupuncture, 134 warming needle acupuncture,146 and electro-acupuncture138 were reported to result in better curative effects than that of medication for patients with disc herniation. The medication used in these trials included oral Fenbid, Mobic, and Nimeisulide. For example the clinical cure rate for one study was 56.67 percent in acupuncture versus 26.67 percent in oral medication group. 146 Similarly acupuncture at Gentong ankle points,154 or huaisanzhen point,195 was better Bilinfen (0.9g) + physiological saline (2 ml)195 shown by higher curative effects. In one trial,138 the application of electro-acupuncture, compared to 7.5 mg/d mobic, significantly improved LBP pain, walking ability, raising straight leg, or muscle strength. 61 Acupuncture + other treatments versus the same other treatments. In two trials, scalp acupuncture in addition to traction193 or massage185 was shown to be more effective than traction or massage alone immediately after treatment. For example, in one study, 193 the rates of clinically cured subjects in the combination and single treatment groups were 21.4 percent (acupuncture + traction) and 13.5 percent (traction alone), respectively. The combination of acupuncture and traction,158 or manual therapy161,172,185 had a significantly better analgesic effect compared to traction or manual therapy alone in patients with disc herniation. 158,161,172,185 In one of these studies, mean post-treatment VAS scores were statistically significantly different: 1.91 \u00b1 0.93 (acupuncture + traction) versus 3.58 \u00b1 1.52 (traction alone). 158 Similarly, abdominal acupuncture in addition to body acupuncture and traction was also found to be more effective than body acupuncture or traction alone in patients with disc herniation (effective rate: 96.88 percent versus 89.29 percent, P < 0.05). 180 In several other trials, acupuncture (or electro-acupuncture) in combination with another therapy (e.g., moxibustion, laser knife, massage) was shown to be more beneficial than acupuncture, laser knife, traction, or massage alone. 150,158,172,177,193 Subjects with nonspecific pain. Acupuncture versus placebo . No relevant studies were identified. Acupuncture versus no treatment . No relevant studies were identified. Acupuncture versus usual care. In one trial,110,112 a long-term post-treatment SF-36 bodily pain score was significantly improved in acupuncture group versus usual care group (mean between-group difference: 8.0, 95 percent CI: 2.8, 13.2). There were statistically nonsignificant differences in favor of acupuncture for disability (Oswestry score: -3.4, 95 percent CI: -7.8, (MPQ: -0.2, 95 percent CI: -0.6, 0.1). There were no significant differences between the acupuncture and usual care groups in the long-term post-treatment mean hospital stay (days), general practitioner visits (3.78 \u00b1 3.36 versus 4.26 \u00b1 4.74), and outpatient visits (0.50 \u00b1 1.62 versus 0.41 \u00b1 1.95). 112 Acupuncture (type 1) versus acupuncture (type 2) . In one trial,153 O3 acupoint injection had a significantly greater therapeutic effect compared to electro-acupuncture. Acupuncture versus other treatments. In two trials, the effect of electro-acupuncture was compared to that of TENS121,209 for LBP treatment. In the first trial,209 electro-acupuncture and TENS did not significantly differ in pain relief. However, in the other trial,121 electro\u00ad acupuncture was associated with a significantly lower pain intensity (VAS scores) compared to TENS (mean between-group VAS score difference: 21, 95 percent CI: 4.12, 37,95).

Population with unknown duration of pain. Nine trials were included in this sub\u00ad section.49,145,176,186,199,210,215,218,219 Six trials were restricted to subjects with nonspecific LBP49,145,199,210,215,218 and three trials enrolled patients with low back pain due to specific causes (sciatica, lumbar vertebrae hyperplasia, intervertebral disk herniation).176,186,219 Subjects with specific pain. Acupuncture versus placebo . No relevant studies were identified. Acupuncture versus no treatment. No relevant studies were identified. Acupuncture versus another type/method of the same CAM. No relevant studies were identified. 62 Acupuncture versus other treatments. In one trial,186 the rate of cure (i.e., pain was absent) was significantly greater in electro-acupuncture (52.0 percent) versus medication group (42.0 percent). In another trial,176 the rate of cure (i.e., absence of pain) was significantly better in the electro-acupuncture versus TENS (80.0 percent versus 44.9 percent, p < 0.005). Acupuncture versus medication . No relevant studies were identified. Acupuncture (type 1) versus acupuncture (type 2) . One trial,219 showed that subjects who received acupuncture at Kuesu point had immediate greater decrease in pain intensity score (PRS) than those who received acupuncture at nonKuesu point (PRS score: 5.30 versus 2.40, p = 0.003) and improvement in ROM extension (73.0 percent versus 40.0 percent). In one trial, 186 the rate of cure (i.e., pain was absent) was significantly greater in electro-acupuncture (52.0 percent) versus acupuncture (40.0 percent). Subjects with nonspecific pain. Acupuncture versus placebo . In one trial, there were no significant differences in the proportions of subjects with improved pain (not specified) between the acupuncture versus placebo (sham-acupuncture). 145 Either real needling210 or total body acupuncture 218 was superior to sham needling in reducing LBP pain intensity immediately post treatment. For example, in one study, 210 the mean pain intensity (VAS score) was 37.3 in acupuncture group and 64.1 in the placebo group. Acupuncture versus no treatment. No relevant studies were identified. Acupuncture (type 1) versus acupuncture (type 2). In two trials199,215 different methods of acupuncture were compared. In one trial,199 insertion of needles within the affected segment near typical acu-points showed to have better analgesic effect than insertion of the needles within the affected segment but far away from the acu-points (mean VAS score: 41.0 versus 83.0) In the other trial, 215 needle retention for about 10 minutes was more effective than the removal immediately after the insertion. Acupuncture versus other treatments. In one trial, there was no significant difference in the proportion of subjects with improved pain between subjects in dry needling acupuncture (61 percent improved) and subjects in acupressure + vapocoolant spray group (66 percent). 49 Acupuncture versus medication. No relevant studies were identified. Acupuncture + other treatments versus the same other treatments. In one trial,49 there was no significant difference in the proportion of subjects with improved pain between the dry needling acupuncture + Lidocaine injection (40 percent) and Lidocaine injection alone (45 percent) groups immediately after the end of treatment. In this trial, although the rate of pain improvement was numerically in favor of acupuncture (dry needling, or trigger point injection) compared to Lidocaine, the observed differences did not reach the statistical significance (61.0 percent versus 40.0 percent-45.0 percent, p > 0.05). 63 2 - Acupuncture for Treatment of Neck Pain This section included 52 trials. Results of 10 trials were reported in multiple publications (Table 3). Population/trial characteristics.

One study recruited elderly adults only (60 years of age or older).45 The proportion of women was greater in 23 studies45,77,80,106,126,128,131,140,235,240,241,245,255\u00ad 257,259,264-269,272, similar to that of men in 13 studies,51,229,234,236-239,242,244,247,249,251,252 smaller to that of men in two studies,258,270 and not reported in 10 studies.17,47,248,250,253,254,260-262,271 One study included only women.263 Racial composition of the study population was not reported in the majority of trials. In total 8,515 participants with neck pain were randomized to acupuncture or control groups. Sample size for these trials ranged from 13258 to 3,451 participants.131 Acupuncture alone (various methods of needling techniques) was used in 47 studies.45\u00ad 47,51,77,79,80,106,126,128,140,229,234-246,248-263,265,266,268,269,271,272 Acupuncture was used in combination with other intervention in the experimental arm in seven studies.17,46,131,247,264,267,270 The control treatment for these trials was the same treatment included in the acupuncture arm (i.e. experimental treatment).

The number of treatments ranged from < 10 sessions, 234,237,247 10-20 sessions,241-243 up to 21-45 sessions.229,236,239,245,246,250,253 Two of the Chinese studies did not report the frequency or number of treatments.254,273 The frequency of treatment in the remaining studies reporting this information was a single treatment,80,238,240,248,260-262 one to two sessions per week (up to 12 treatments in total),79,131,235,244,255-257,263,265,267 two sessions per week (up to 18 treatments in total),47,51,77,106,128,140,249,258,259,266,268,272 three sessions per week (up to nine treatments in total),45,46,271 and four sessions per week (> 24 treatments in total).270 Risk of bias. The risk-of-bias graph for the trials included in this sub-section is presented in Figure 24. All trials were randomized. The adequate method of randomization and treatment allocation concealment was reported for about 26.0 percent and 15.0 percent of the trials, respectively. In 62.0 percent of the trials, the subjects' baseline characteristics distribution across the treatment arms was similar (i.e., balanced). For at least 15.0 percent of the trials, it was 65 unclear whether or not the subjects and assessors were blinded to the type of treatment. That subjects were blinded was reported for only 62.0 percent of the trials. Half of the trials reported acceptable drop-out rates (i.e., < 20.0 percent). 9 Results based on intention-to-treat analysis were explicitly reported for 25.0 percent of the trials. The data for selected items of the risk of bias tool across the CAM interventions (acupuncture; spinal manipulation; spinal mobilization; combination of manipulation and mobilization; and massage therapy) is displayed in table 7.2 of Appendix G.

This sub-section included only one trial conducted in subjects with specific neck pain (whiplash injuries). Subjects with specific pain. Acupuncture versus placebo . One trial17 evaluated the effects of acupuncture, laser acupuncture, and no treatment randomly given to patients with acute whiplash injuries. In all three groups, patients additionally received the combination of cervical collar and medication (450 mg Paracetamol and 100 mg Chlormezanon in a dose of three tablets a day). Patients who received acupuncture experienced numerically greater improvements in cervical ROM, shortened duration of acute pain and sick leave as compared to those in the other two treatment groups.

A total of 31 trials evaluated the efficacy and/or harms of acupuncture in patients with chronic neck pain. 45-47,51,77,80,106,126,128,131,140,234,235,241,244,251,254-261,265\u00ad 268,270-272 Of these, 13 trials included patients with specific neck pain (e.g., myofascial pain syndrome, spinal canal stenosis, cervical disc disease)45,46,77,80,126,234,241,244,251,254,255,268,271 and the remaining 18 trials included patients with nonspecific neck pain.47,51,106,128,131,140,235,256-261,265\u00ad 267,270,272 Subjects with specific pain. Acupuncture versus placebo . In three trials, acupuncture77,234 or dry needling80 were similar to sham acupuncture234 or laser acupuncture77,80) for immediate/short-term post-treatment pain intensity (VAS, PPT),77,80,234 disability (NDI),234 and cervical ROM77,80,234 in patients with disc space narrowing/joint arthritis234 or myofascial pain syndrome.77,80 For example, in one of these trials,80 post-treatment mean VAS values in dry needling and sham laser acupuncture groups were 29.2 (\u00b1 21.9) and 28.0 (\u00b1 19.4), respectively. The corresponding values were 48.1 (\u00b1 7.0) versus 47.4 (\u00b1 7.1).80 In the same trial,80 distant acupuncture led to significantly lower pain intensity on VAS compared to sham (19.1 \u00b1 16.1 versus 28.0 \u00b1 19.4). No formal statistical test results for between-group comparisons were reported (e.g., p-value, 95 percent confidence interval). 80 Results of one meta-analysis indicated no significant difference between acupuncture and placebo in the reduction of pain intensity, immediately after the end of treatment (pooled mean difference in VAS score: 0.27, 95 percent CI: -0.60, 1.13) 80,234 (Figure 25). 73 Figure 25 .

No relevant studies were identified. Acupuncture (type 1) versus acupuncture (type 2). In seven trials,46,80,241,251,254,268,271 different modes of acupuncture were evaluated. These included electro-acupuncture local points,271 electro-acupuncture remote points,271 needling,80 acu-point sticking therapy,254 and relevant versus irrelevant points.268 In one trial,271 the use of electro-acupuncture (a local percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) at local points was superior to acupuncture alone or electro-acupuncture at remote points in patients with cervical disc disease. The immediate post-treatment percent change on VAS for acupuncture versus local electro-acupuncture was 9.0 percent versus 38.0 percent; and the percent decrease in need for analgesics across these groups was 6.0 percent versus 37.0 percent. In another trial, 80 distant acupuncture led to a significantly lower pain intensity on VAS (19.1 \u00b1 16.1) compared with dry needling (29.2 \u00b1 21.9) in patients with myofascial pain syndrome. There was a slight benefit of using Japanese acupuncture over irrelevant acupuncture (i.e., targeting nonspecific points) in immediate-/short-term post-treatment levels of pain intensity (SF-MPQ) in patients with myofascial pain syndrome (p < 0.05). 268 In one trial,254 acupoint sticking therapy produced a greater effect rate ( percentage of patients with no symptoms, able to work, without relapse) compared to standard acupuncture (93.5 percent versus 72.4 percent, p < 0.05). In one trial, standard acupuncture did not differ from turtle-probing needling in producing immediate post-treatment analgesic effect (VAS pain post treatment mean 34.0 versus 36.0). 241 Similarly, addition of IMS to dry needling in patient with myofascial pain syndrome did not have a significant effect on relieving pain when compared to dry needling alone (mean VAS post treatment: 4.54 \u00b1 1.82 versus 4.69 \u00b1 2.05). 46 In one trail, there was either numerically or statistically significant greater benefit for the combination of acupuncture + Moxibustion, compared to acupuncture alone in improving immediate/short-term post-treatment pain intensity (NRS, VAS, FACES, PPT). 251 Acupuncture versus other treatments. In two trials acupuncture was compared either to massage77or spinal manipulation.244 In the first trial,77 which enrolled 177 patients with whiplash injuries and myofascial pain syndrome, acupuncture was shown to produce statistically significantly greater reduction in pain intensity (VAS score scale: 0-100) compared to massage in a short-term post-treatment period (mean change in VAS score from baseline: 24.22 versus 7.89, p = 0.005). The difference in efficacy with respect to pain intensity between acupuncture and massage was more pronounced in patients with myofascial pain syndrome or those with longer duration of disease (> 5 years). Although short-term post-treatment cervical ROM 74 (flexion, extension, and rotation) in the acupuncture group was significantly greater than that in the massage group (mean degrees: 19.8 \u00b1 38.0 versus 5.1 \u00b1 22.2, p = 0.031), this difference between the two groups decreased at a later followup (mean \u00b1 SD: 8.9 \u00b1 30.1 versus 5.5 \u00b1 37.2, p = 0.81). No significant between-group difference was noted for PPT at any followup point. 77 The combination of warm acupuncture and spinal manipulation had a better analgesic effect than acupuncture or spinal manipulation alone, in patients with neck pain due to spinal stenosis (mean VAS at short-term Acupuncture versus medication . Three trials 45,126,268 compared acupuncture to medications or medical injections. In two trials,45,126 subjects with myofascial pain syndrome and headache 126 or chronic neck pain with headache 45 treated with acupuncture did not differ from those treated with injection of Lidocaine,45,126 Lidocaine plus corticoid,126 or Botulinum toxin126 for short-term post-treatment improvements in pain (Symptom Severity Index, VAS, Wong-Baker FACES pain scale) 45,126 or cervical ROM (flexion, extension, tilting, and rotation).45 For example, in one of these trials,45 2 week post-treatment mean VAS values (scale: 0-10) for acupuncture and were 3.82 \u00b1 2.47 and 3.46 \u00b1 2.47, respectively (p > 0.05). The ROM flexion and extension values in the acupuncture group were 68.89 \u00b1 11.19 and 67.72 \u00b1 14.06, respectively. The corresponding ROM values in the Lidocaine injection group were 68.33 \u00b1 14.78 Although the number of ingested ibuprofen pills over 3 months numerically increased in all three intervention groups (needle, Lidocaine, Lidocaine plus corticoid, Botulinum toxin), 126 there was no significant between-group difference at any time during the study periods (12 weeks: 32.93 15.53 \u00b1 21.93, respectively). In one trial, 268 relevant acupuncture was found to be modestly more effective than NSAIDs in reducing pain intensity (VAS, SF-MPQ) for myofascial pain syndrome. Acupuncture + other treatments versus the same other treatments. Two trials, 244,255 compared the efficacy and/or harms of acupuncture alone to combination of acupuncture with other treatments. These treatments included acupuncture + traction manipulation, 244 and acupuncture + auriculotherapy.255 There was either numerically or statistically signi ficant greater benefit for the combination of acupuncture with traction manipulation, compared to acupuncture alone in improving immediate/short-term post-treatment pain intensity (NRS, VAS, FACES, PPT).244 In one trial,255 amongst patients with myofascial pain syndrome, there was no statistically significant difference between short-/intermediate-term post-treatment effects of acupuncture alone versus acupuncture plus auricular acupuncture therapy on pain intensity (MPQ mean \u00b1 SD: 15.6 \u00b1 11.4 versus 12.9 \u00b1 13.9, p > 0.05; VAS pain mean \u00b1 SD: 18.9 \u00b1 15.6 versus 21.0 \u00b1 19.9, p > 0.05). Subjects with nonspecific pain. Acupuncture versus placebo . Standard acupuncture and placebo were compared in 10 trials, 47,106,128,256-261,266 of which six found no significant difference between the two treatments in reducing post-treatment (immediate, short, or intermediate) pain (VAS, PPT, MPQ),47,256,257,260,261,266 or increasing cervical ROM.266 In most these trials placebo was represented by sham-acupuncture,47,256,257,260,261 and in one trial placebo was transcutaneous nerve stimulation (TENS).266 In contrast, in five trials,106,128,258-260 acupuncture was significantly better than placebo in improving pain intensity (VAS, NPQ, five-point scale)106,128,258-260 disability (NDI),128 the proportion of patients not taking analgesic medication,259 cervical mobility (active, passive; ROM),106,259 or quality of life (SF-36 physical component).128,259 The placebo treatments used in 75 these trials were sham TENS at acupuncture points128, TENS (not at acu-points or not specified),258,259 or placebo-Diazepam.260 The meta-analysis showed no significant difference between acupuncture and placebo (sham\u00ad acupuncture) in reduction of immediate post-treatment pain intensity (pooled mean difference in VAS score: -0.24, 95 percent CI: -1.20, 0.73)256,257,266 (Figure 26). Trials comparing acupuncture to other types of placebos (e.g., TENS, drug)128,258-260 could not be pooled due to heterogeneity across outcomes, followup periods, or missing data. Figure 26 .

In five trials, different modes of acupuncture were compared.47,235,240,256,261 The following techniques were compared as follows: standard acupuncture versus trigger point acupuncture,256 standard acupuncture versus electro\u00ad acupuncture,235,261 classical acupuncture versus laser acupuncture,47 needle insertion across the muscle fibers versus needle insertion along the muscle fibers.240 Authors of one trial256 found standard acupuncture to be clinically less beneficial than trigger point acupuncture but similar to nontrigger acupuncture in decreasing pain intensity (VAS: 51.6 \u00b1 22.0 versus 11.0 \u00b1 9.3 versus 57.6 \u00b1 18.0, respectively) and disability (NDI: 10.9 \u00b1 6.6 versus 3.1 \u00b1 3.2 versus 12.0 \u00b1 4.5, respectively) immediately after treatment. In another trial, 235 the addition of electro-acupuncture produced significantly greater improvements in VAS scores compared to standard acupuncture alone immediately and short-term after the treatment (p < 0.05). In one trial, 47 laser acupuncture at classical acupuncture points and conventional needle acupuncture at classical acupuncture points did not differ in pain relief. There was no significant difference between standard acupuncture and nontraditional acupuncture (i.e., inconsistent with Chinese practice) as reported in this trial. 47 In one trial,240 there were no significant differences between insertion of needles along the muscle fibers towards trigger points and insertion of needles across muscle fibers, in reducing motion related pain (mean VAS score), pain under pressure, or ROM. The standard acupuncture did not differ from electro-acupuncture in producing immediate post-treatment analgesic effect (VAS pain post-treatment mean \u00b1SD: 1.8 \u00b1 1.0 versus 1.4 \u00b1 1.5, p > 0.05).in patients with cervical osteoarthritis. 261 Acupuncture versus other treatments. Results from three trials indicated that there was no significant difference between standard acupuncture as compared to standard localized mobilization techniques, 265 or laser therapy (three separate doses),47,106 in reducing immediate/short-term post-treatment pain intensity (VAS, PPT),106,265 disability (NPQ),265 cervical ROM (extension, flexion),106,265 or improving general health (General Health 76 Questionnaire 28).265 In one of two trials,51,140 acupuncture was better than manipulation in reducing pain intensity (VAS score: percentage decrease) short-term after the end of 9 weeks treatment (50.0 percent versus 42.0 percent).51 In the same trial,51,52 intermediate-term followup results (3 months post-treatment) indicated numerically similar pain intensity in the acupuncture group compared with manipulation group (VAS median scores: 2.5 versus 2.8). This trial failed to report test results for between-group comparisons. In the other trial, 140 immediate post\u00ad treatment reduction in pain intensity (VAS: 33.0 percent) and neck disability (NDI score: 25.0 percent) was significantly greater in manipulation versus acupuncture group. Acupuncture versus medication . Acupuncture and medication (e.g., NSAIDs, analgesics) were compared in three trials. 51,140,260 In the first trial,260 with a limited statistical power, there was no statistically significant difference in pain VAS scores immediately post-treatment between the acupuncture and Diazepam (orally, five mg) groups of subjects with osteoarthritis. The second trial 140 did not report between group differences in pain and disability scores. Calculation of median effect size suggested no difference in pain and disability at immediate post-treatment followup. The proportion of patients crossing over to another intervention was statistically significantly different (p = 0.002) across the three interventions: manipulation (22.2 percent), acupuncture (60.0 percent), and NSAIDs (62.0 percent). 140 In the third trial,51 acupuncture group appeared to have a significantly improved neck pain (mean VAS scores) compared to medication group immediately post intervention. For example, mean VAS \u00b1 SD scores in the acupuncture and medication groups were 4.0 \u00b1 4.4 and. 6.0 \u00b1 4.4, respectively. 51 Intermediate-term followup results (3 months post- treatment) from one of these trials 51,52 showed numerically better pain intensity for acupuncture compared to medication (VAS median scores: 2.5 versus 4.7). This trial failed to report test results for between-group comparisons. Acupuncture + other treatments versus the same other treatments. This sub-section included three trials. 131,267,270 In two trials,131,267 acupuncture was added to either general practitioner care 267 or conventional care,131 and in one trial,270 acupuncture and waiting list control groups were compared. In the first trial,131 treatment with acupuncture added to routine - conventional care was shown to produce a significantly reduced pain intensity (VAS scores), disability (Neck Pain and Disability scale; NPAD), and physical functioning scores (SF-36) compared to treatment with routine care alone immediately after the end of treatment. The between-group differences for SF\u00ad36 (physical functioning: 1.3, 95 percent CI: 0.1, 2.5) and NPAD (2.9, 95 percent CI: 0.8, 4.9) were statistically significant at 3 months post-treatment. In the other trial, 267 acupuncture was added to general practice care and showed no difference in pain and disability (NPQ) compared to general practice care alone immediately post-treatment. The proportion of patients reporting the use of medication in the acupuncture group decreased from baseline to 3 months (from 40.0 percent to 11.1 percent) as opposed to the general practitioner group in which it did not change over the same period of time (from 43.0 percent to 42.0 percent). In the third trial, 270 there was no significant difference in the mean pain scores (3.6 versus 5.4) or mean number of pills taken per week (7.5 versus 8.7) between the combined acupuncture and other treatment alone at 12 weeks post-randomization. Population with mixed duration of pain. A total of 14 trials evaluating the efficacy and/or harms of acupuncture in patients with neck pain of mixed duration were included in this section. 229,236-238,240,242,243,245-247,252,253,263,269 All except for one trial240 enrolled patients with specific neck pain (e.g., spondylosis, spondylopathy, myofascial pain syndrome, whiplash 77 injuries). Please, see the results of two trials246,247 in the Massage section, Mixed Duration Neck Pain sub-sections. Subjects with specific pain. Acupuncture versus placebo . In one trial,263 60 patients with myofascial pain syndrome had similar post-treatment pain intensity (VAS, PPT), cervical ROM, functional status (Nottingham Health Profile - pain scale), and the use of analgesics in the acupuncture versus placebo (laser pen) group and the observed differences were statistically nonsignificant at all followup time points. Acupuncture versus no treatment. No relevant studies were identified. Acupuncture (type 1) versus acupuncture (type 2). In six trials, acupuncture was compared to electro-acupuncture, 243 compared most tender points and nonselective points.269 Two trials demonstrated that in patients with spondylopathy or spondylosis, the use of electro-acupuncture had significantly better therapeutic effect (percentage of the relative mean score change between baseline and post-treatment followup) compared to routine acupuncture. 243 Different modalities of acupuncture were compared in six Chinese trials.236-238,242,252,269 The results indicated numerically or statistically significantly better therapeutic effects (defined differently across the trials as dichotomous outcome) of (at Jiaji, Cuchi points). In one trial,269 there was a greater proportion of patients with myofascial pain syndrome having pain relief ('yes' or 'no' answer) amongst those needled at most tender points as opposed to those needled at nonselective points. Acupuncture versus other treatments. In three trials, acupuncture was compared to laser, 263 traction-massage,252 or traction.229 In the first trial,263 patients immediately after being treated with laser therapy, had significantly improved pain intensity (VAS: 2.05 \u00b1 1.43 versus 3.71 \u00b1 (Nottingham pain scale: \u00b1 14.07 versus 33.86 \u00b1 28.37, p < 0.001) compared to those treated with acupuncture. However, 5 months post\u00adtreatment, the observed between-group differences in the above mentioned outcomes got numerically diminished and were no longer statistically significant (p > 0.05). Although the use of analgesics immediately after the treatment was significantly lower in the laser therapy versus acupuncture group (0.85 \u00b1 1.53 versus 3.62 \u00b1 4.41, p < 0.05), 5 months later the use of analgesics between the two groups differed no more (1.41 \u00b1 3.43 versus 2.53 \u00b1 2.74, p > 0.05). 263 In the second trial,252 acupuncture was shown to have a greater effect on well being (no numerical data reported) compared to traction-massage in patients with spondylosis. In one trial, 229 it was demonstrated that in patients with spondylopathy or spondylosis, the use of electro-acupuncture had significantly better therapeutic effect (percentage of the relative mean score change between baseline and post-treatment followup) compared to traction. Acupuncture versus medication. No relevant studies were identified. Acupuncture + other treatments versus other treatments. In one small Chinese trial, 245 the combination of electro-acupuncture and acupuncture did not differ from electro-acupuncture alone in producing curative therapeutic effect (percentage of patients with no symptoms who were able to work without relapse). 78 Subjects with nonspecific pain. Acupuncture versus placebo . No relevant studies were identified. Acupuncture versus no treatment. No relevant studies were identified. Acupuncture (type 1) versus acupuncture (type 2). In one trial of 47 patients,240 two modalities of Fu's subcutaneous needling were compared, needling along the local muscle fibers pointed to the myofascial trigger points, and needling across the local muscle fibers pointed to the myofascial trigger points. Although post-treatment pain intensity (VAS; motion-related, pain under pressure) and cervical ROM improved significantly in both groups, there were statistically nonsignificant differences with respect to pain intensity (motion-related: 3.59 versus 2.76, p = 0.95; pain under pressure: 3.82 versus 3.28, p = 0.38) and cervical ROM (flexion, extension, and rotation: 1.36 versus 1.12, p = 0.38) between the two groups of patients. Acupuncture versus other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Acupuncture versus medication. No relevant studies were identified. Acupuncture + other treatments versus the same other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Population with unknown duration of pain. A total of six trials were included in this sub\u00ad section. 239,248-250,262,264 Subjects with specific pain. Acupuncture versus placebo . In one trial,248 acupuncture was shown to be associated with a significantly greater effective rate (percentage of patients with no symptoms or relapse: 75.5 percent versus 52.8 percent, p < 0.05) compared to placebo (needling at non acupuncture points) right after the treatment. Acupuncture versus no treatment. In one trial, 264 acupuncture was shown to be significantly more effective than no treatment in improving pain intensity (short form MPQ) and PPT shortly after the end of treatment. Acupuncture (type 1) versus acupuncture (type 2). In three Chinese trials, 239,249,250 different modalities of acupuncture were compared. These included needle pricking,249 long-time needle retention,239 or point-through-point needling.250 In all three trials the short-term post-treatment results indicated numerically or statistically significantly better therapeutic effects (defined differently across the trials as dichotomous outcome) of needle pricking, 249 long-time needle retention,239 or point-through-point needling250 compared to routine acupuncture. Acupuncture versus other treatments. In three trials,249,262,264 acupuncture was shown to be significantly more effective than injection of Lidocaine,249,262 or exercise264 in improving pain intensity (VAS, SF-MPQ, PPT) and/or disability (neck pain disability VAS) shortly after the end of treatment. Acupuncture versus medication. No relevant studies were identified. Acupuncture + other treatments versus the same other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Subjects with nonspecific pain. Acupuncture versus placebo . No relevant studies were identified. Acupuncture versus no treatment. No relevant studies were identified. Acupuncture versus another type/method of the same CAM. No relevant studies were identified. Acupuncture versus other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Acupuncture versus medication. No relevant studies were identified. 79 Acupuncture + other treatments versus the same other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. 3 - Spinal Manipulation for Treatment of Low Back Pain We included 28 studies using manipulation alone and six studies using manipulation plus other treatments.31,57,123,274-276 Note that one trial277 reported results for subjects with acute and chronic pain separately, therefore this trial appears in two sub-sections of acute and chronic pain. Results of nine trials were reported in multiple publications (Table 3). Population/trial characteristics. The studies were conducted in Australia (three),51,140,274 Bulgaria (one),20 Canada (four),278-281 China (two),275,282 Denmark Italy South Africa (one),285 UK (five),123,230,286-288 and United States (13).31,55,57,101,119,289-296 The proportion of men and women was similar in 19 studies (40 percent to <60 percent).20,31,51,55,57,119,123,140,275-279,285,288,289,291,295,296 In five studies, there was a greater proportion of men (> 60 percent)101,280,281,284,290 and in five studies women were the majority (> 60 percent).274,282,283,286,293 For the remaining studies, this information was not reported.104,230,287,292,294 The included studies consisted of adults aged 18 years or older. The racial composition or ethnicity was reported for only four studies.123,275,289,290 In three trials, the majority of subjects were Caucasians.123,289,290 This information was not reported for the remaining trials. In total 15,969 participants with LBP were randomized to manipulation (alone or combined with other treatment) or control groups. One large RCT accounted for 11,128 patients during its 11 years of recruitment between 1986 and 2007. 275 Table 10 presents the control interventions in the included studies. Table 10.

The risk-of-bias graph for the trials included in this sub-section is presented in Figure 27. All trials were randomized. One trial, was reported in an abstract format and was not included in the assessment of risk of bias. 287 The adequate method of randomization and treatment allocation concealment was reported for 18.0 percent and 11.0 percent of the trials, respectively. Up to 61.0 percent of the trials reported that distribution of the subjects' baseline characteristics across the treatment arms was similar. The subjects were reported to be blinded in only 11.0 percent of the trials. About 36.0 percent of the trials reported acceptable drop-out rate. Results based on intention-to-treat analysis were explicitly reported for 25.0 percent of the trials. The data for selected items of the risk of bias tool across the CAM interventions (acupuncture; 81 spinal manipulation; spinal mobilization; combin ation of manipulation and mobilization; and massage therapy) is displayed in table 7.1 of Appendix G.

This sub-section included 11 trials.20,55,57,101,123,274,277,284,287,290,291 All trials enrolled subjects with nonspecific LBP. Results from two trials, comparing manipulation to massage,101 or manipulation to mobilization55 are presented in the Acute or Sub-Acute LBP sub-sections of Massage and Mobilization sections. Subjects with specific pain. Manipulation versus placebo . No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation versus no treatment. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation versus another type/method of the Same CAM. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation versus other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation versus medication. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation + other treatments versus the same other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Subjects with nonspecific pain. Manipulation versus placebo . In five trials, 20,57,277,284,291 manipulation was compared to placebo at immediate or short-term post-treatment followup, indicating significantly greater improvements for manipulation versus placebo groups in reducing immediate or short-term post\u00adtreatment pain intensity (VAS). In contrast, there were no between-group differences in disability (Oswestry), 57 flexibility/mobility,20,57 or pain medication use.57 For example, in one trial,277 manipulation was significantly superior to placebo in relieving pain in subjects with or without neurological signs at short term followup (four-point VAS; p< 0.01). Intermediate-term post\u00adtreatment data of the same trial showed no significant difference in relieving pain between the groups of manipulation and placebo. In another trial, 284 subjects randomized to manipulation had significantly better immediate-term post-treatm ent pain intensity (percentage of pain-free subjects: 92.0 percent versus 25.0 percent, p < 0.01) and mobility (improvement on Schober's test: 100.0 percent versus 50.0 percent, p < 0.01) compared to those randomized to placebo (i.e., simulated short-wave therapy). Manipulation versus no treatment. The use of manipulation, compared to 'no treatment' was associated with a significantly lower immediate post-treatment pain intensity on five-point VAS (p = 0.03). 291 Manipulation versus another type/method of the same CAM. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation versus other treatments. In one trial,20, post-treatment differences in pain intensity (VAS), disability (Oswestry), depression score (modified Zung scale), integrated electromyographic activity (EMG(, and maximal voluntary contraction were not significant between the manipulation and the muscle relaxation groups. In another study, 277 at short term post-treatment followup, manipulation was more efficacious in relieving pain four-point VAS) and improving function (using a four-point disability questionnaire) compared to bed rest or physiotherapy (massage, analgesic currents and diathermy) in subjects with acute pain. However, this advantage was not sustained at 6 months followup in both groups of subjects with or without radiating pain. In this trial, a subgroup of subjects with acute pain and a chronic history of pain were randomized to manipulation versus physiotherapy, low back school, or bed rest. Manipulation therapy at short term (3 weeks, 2 months) followup was significantly better in reducing pain intensity than back school or placebo. For the same period, physiotherapy was shown to be more effective in relieving pain and improving function than manipulation. At intermediate (6 months) post-treatment followup, 89 manipulation was better than placebo but did not differ from physiotherapy or back school.(numerical data not reported; only graphs were presented).277 In two trials,101,290 manipulation did not differ from myofascial therapy (alone or combined with manipulation),290 TENS,101 or corset101 in improving pain intensity (VAS),101,290 disability (RMDQ),290 or range of mobility (straight leg raising, pelvic flexion/extension, Schober's test),101 immediately after the end of treatment. In one trial,123 manipulation combined with best care had a modest improvement compared to best care alone or combined with exercise in disability and pain. Manipulation versus medication. In one trial,287 there were no significant post-treatment differences between the manipulation and medication (e.g., antiinflammatory agents) groups with respect to reduction in pain intensity or disability. In another study, 277 at short term post-treatment followup, manipulation was more efficacious in relieving pain (4-point VAS) and improving function (using 4-point disability questionnaire) compared to drug therapy in subjects with acute pain. This advantage was not sustained at 6 months followup. In this trial, a subgroup of subjects with acute pain in a chronic history of pain were also randomized to manipulation versus drug therapy. For 3 weeks and 2 months post\u00adtreatment periods, drug therapy was shown to be more effective in relieving pain and improving function than manipulation. At intermediate (6 months) post-treatment followup, manipulation did not differ from drug therapy (numerical data not reported; only graphs were presented). 277 Manipulation + other treatments versus the same other treatments. In one trial,274 short-term post-treatment pain intensity (VAS: versus 3.64 \u00b1 2.80, p < 0.001) were significantly better in the manipulation + exercise group compared to the exercise alone group. Population with chronic pain. This sub-section included 12 trials. 51,119,140,276,277,279\u00ad 281,286,289,292,293 All trials studied subjects with nonspecific LBP.

No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation versus other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation versus medication. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation + other treatments versus the same other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Subjects with nonspecific pain. Manipulation versus placebo . The effects of manipulation and placebo were compared in three trials. 119,277,293 In these trials, manipulation was associated with significantly greater improvements in pain (VAS) compared to placebo. In the first trial,119 immediately after the treatment, subjects in the manipulation group had a significantly improved disability level (i.e., decreased Oswestry scores) compared to those in placebo group (9.5 \u00b1 6.3 versus 15.5 \u00b1 10.8, p = 0.012). Although the observed difference 2 weeks after the treatment was numerically in favor of manipulation, compared to placebo, this 90 difference did not reach the traditional level of statistical significance (10.6 \u00b1 11.7 versus 14.0 \u00b1 11.7, p = 0.41).119 In the second trial,293 the improvement in post-treatment pain intensity (VAS) was numerically greater in the manipulation versus placebo group immediately (1.3 versus 0.7, p-value for between-group comparison not reported) or short-term post-treatment (2.3 versus 0.6, p-value for between-group comparison not reported). In the third trial, 277 manipulation was significantly better in reducing short- and intermediate- term post-treatment pain intensity (4- point VAS) compared to placebo in patients with chronic LBP with or without radiating pain. This trial failed to report numeric data. Manipulation versus no treatment. In one trial, 281 subjects randomized to manipulation and 'no treatment' were compared with respect to flexion-relaxation degree. In this trial, the post\u00adtreatment flexion-relaxation degree did not differ between subjects in the manipulation and 'no treatment' groups. Manipulation (type 1) versus manipulation (type 2). In one trial, 289 the short-term post\u00ad treatment effect on pain (NRS-11) and functional disability (the Modified Von Korff Scales - MVK) was significantly increased for subjects who received a greater number of manipulation treatments whether alone or combined with physical therapy. 289 Manipulation versus other treatments. In two trials, manipulation was shown to produce significantly greater immediate post-treatment improvements in pain (VAS, NRS), disability (RMDQ, Oswestry), and ROM (lumbar flexion and extension) compared to massage, 292 or ultrasound.286 In one trial,277 at 3 weeks post-treatment, physiotherapy (massage, and physical modalities) was more effective compared to manipulation or back school in patients without radiating pain. In this subgroup, patients originally randomized to manipulation showed significantly more improvement compared to back school (or placebo) at 3 weeks and 2 months but not at 6 months followup. The same trial, but in a subgroup of patients with radiating back pain, showed more improvement in pain and function with manipulation than back school at 3 weeks but not at 2 months or 6 months of followup. Physiotherapy and low back school were more effective than manipulation in both 2 months and 6 months followup. This trial failed to report numeric data. 277 In another trial,280 subjective analgesic effect of back school program was significantly better compared to manipulation in patients with sacroiliac joint pain immediately after the treatment. Manipulation versus medication. In one trial,277 at 3 weeks, short term- and intermediate- term post-treatment, spinal manipulation was not significantly different from drug therapy in reducing pain (4-point VAS; no numeric data were given). In contrast, in two other trials, 51,140 subjects in manipulation groups experienced significantly greater immediate post-treatment reductions in pain intensity (VAS score: 38.0 percent -50.0 percent) and disability (Oswestry score: 30.7 percent -50.0 percent) compared with subjects in the medication groups. Manipulation + other treatments versus the same other treatments. In one trial, 276 at short- and intermediate-term after the treatment, manipulation combined with exercise did not significantly differ from exercise alone in improving pain (VAS). Manipulation versus manipulation + other treatments. In one trial,289 the short-term post\u00ad treatment effect on pain (NRS-11) and functional disability (the Modified Von Korff Scales - MVK) did not differ between manipulation alone or combined with physical therapy. 289 91 Population with mixed duration of pain. This sub-section included 10 trials. 31,104,230,275,278,283,288,294-296 Of the nine trials, two studied subjects with specific LBP (e.g., disc protrusion, sciatica).230,275 Subjects with specific pain. Manipulation versus placebo . No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation versus no treatment. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation versus another type/method of the same CAM. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation versus other treatments. The immediate and short-term post-treatment effects of manipulation and infra-red therapy were compared in subjects with sciatica.230 Similar recovery rates (percentage of pain-free subjects) were found between the two groups amongst subjects with normal straight leg raise (58.0 percent versus 68.0 percent, p > 0.05). In contrast, amongst subjects with restricted straight leg raise, the between-group difference in recovery rate was significant, favoring subjects in the manipulation group over infra-red therapy group (77.2 percent versus 56.6 percent, p < 0.05). In one trial, 11,128 subjects with disc protrusion who received a combination of manipulation and physiotherapy (traction, microwave and other modalities) had significantly greater healing (73.4 percent versus 47.3 percent, p < 0.01) and effective rates (98.6 percent versus 96.4 percent, p < 0.01) compared to subjects who received physiotherapy alone. 275 Manipulation versus medication. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation + other treatments versus the same other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Subjects with nonspecific pain. Manipulation versus placebo . In one trial,104 the immediate post-treatment back pain improvement (percent change on VAS) was numerically greater in the manipulation group compared to placebo group (statistical test results were not provided). The beneficial effect of manipulation relative to placebo was more evident in subjects under 40 years (compared to subjects 40 years or older) or subjects with sub-acute LBP (versus subjects with acute LBP).104 Manipulation versus no treatment. In one trial,288 subjects randomized to receive manipulation, experienced significant reduction (from baseline) in immediate/short-term post\u00adtreatment pain intensity (VAS: 12.20 versus 10.40, p < 0.05). In contrast, subjects randomized to no treatment group, did not experience significant reduction in pain intensity (p = 0.10). Manipulation (type 1) versus manipulation (type 2). In one trial, 294 subjects with sub-acute and chronic LBP who received upper cervical adjustment as well as upper cervical + full spine adjustment experienced significant improvement in pain intensity (VAS score) compared to baseline. The group of subjects who received full spine adjustment only, did not improve in pain intensity (VAS) but did improve in disability (Oswestry score). Numerical data for these groups were not reported. Manipulation versus other treatments. In one trial, 278 short-term post-treatment effects of manipulation and 'educational booklet' were compared and no significant differences in pain (11-point pain scale measuring symptom bothersomeness: 2.0 \u00b1 2.2 versus 3.2 \u00b1 3.2, p = 0.06) or disability (RMDQ: 3.1 \u00b1 4.1 versus 4.1 \u00b1 4.9, p = 0.28) were found between the two groups. In the same trial, no significant differences were found in short-term post-treatment effects on pain (percentage of pain-free subjects, 11-point pain scale) or disability (RMDQ) between manipulation and physiotherapy (McKenzie technique based on diagnoses of derangement, dysfunction or postural syndromes). In another trial, 296 high or low velocity spinal manipulation 92 (SM) was compared to minimal conservative medical care (aiming to improve pain with optimization of activities of daily living with patient specific choice of medication) in older adults. Spinal manipulation was significantly more effective compared to medical care alone in improving immediate, short-, or intermediate-term post-treatment disability (adjusted RMDQ score: 0-24) and perception of improvement (score: 1-10), but not pain (VAS score: 0\u00ad100) or physical function (SF-36 score: 0-100). The adjusted RMDQ mean change from baseline values in the high and low velocity manipulation and medical care groups were 2.7 (95 percent CI: 2.0, 3.3), 2.9 (95 percent CI: 2.2, 3.6), and 1.6 (95 percent CI: 0.5, 2.8), respectively. Manipulation versus other CAM treatments. In one trial, 295 subjects in the manipulation groups did not significantly differ from subjects in the massage group, with respect to straight leg raising. 295 In this trial, the data immediately after the end of treatment indicated significantly better spinal flexibility (e.g., walking, bending, twisting, sitting down in a chair, reaching, dressing) in the manipulation group compared to the massage group. 295 In one trial,296 high velocity spinal manipulation was similar to low velocity manipulation in reducing immediate, short term- and intermediate-term post treatment pain intensity (VAS score: 0-100) or disability (Oswestry score: 0-24) in adults \u0095 55 years or older. Both treatment methods were effective in the reduction of LBP symptoms. Manipulation versus medication. The results of one underpowered trial 283 indicated statistically nonsignificantly greater proportion of pain-free subjects in the manipulation versus medication group (50.0 percent versus 11.0 percent, p = 0.15), and therefore were rendered as inconclusive. In another trial, 104 the immediate post-treatment back pain improvement (percent change on VAS) was numerically greater in the manipulation group compared to the medication group (statistical test results were not provided). The beneficial effect of manipulation relative to medication was more evident in subjects under 40 years (compared to subjects 40 years or older) or subjects with sub-acute/chronic LBP (versus subjects with acute LBP). 104 Manipulation + other treatments versus the same other treatments. In one trial,31 131 subjects were randomized to either a combination of manipulation and exercise or exercise alone for 4 weeks. The subjects then were grouped into positive and negative subgroups according to whether or not they met a pre-specified set of 5 criteria (duration of current episode < 16 days, no symptoms distal to the knee, FABQ work subscale score < 19, \u0095 1 hypomobile lumbar spine segment, \u0095 1 hip with > 35 degrees of internal rotation range motion). Immediately after the end of treatment, the rate of success (> 50.0 percent improvement on Oswestry disability scale) in the manipulation group was significantly greater compared to the exercise alone group (62.9 percent versus 36.1 percent, p = 0.002). At intermediate-term post-treatment followup, the mean Oswestry disability score was significantly lower in subjects receiving manipulation plus exercise compared to those receiving exercise alone (mean between-group difference: 10.1, 95 percent CI: 4.3, 15.9, p = 0.001). Moreover, medication use and healthcare utilization was significantly lower in the manipulation group compared to the exercise group. The subgroup analysis indicated that the greatest treatment effect of manipulation relative to exercise was observed for subjects classified as positive on the prediction rule (i.e., meeting at least 4 of the 5 criteria). In the same trial, 31,35 the subject's age, gender, symptom duration, or the therapist's years of experience did not have a significant effect on the mean change on Oswestry score. This study also reported an increased risk of worsening disability for patients who did not receive spinal manipulation (11 percent versus 3 percent in exercise group and spinal manipulation + exercise group respectively; RR = 8.0, 95 percent CI: 1.1, 63.5) measured by Oswestry disability scores obtained at 6 months of followup. In addition, failure rates were 93 higher in subgroup of patients with hypomobility (74.4 percent versus 26 percent in exercise versus manipulation + exercise groups respectively). However, patients with hypermobility were more likely to benefit from stabilizing exercise than spinal manipulation + exercise (failure rates of 22.0 percent versus 83.3 percent in exercise and spinal manipulation + exercise groups respectively). Population with unknown duration of pain. This sub-section included two trials, 282,285 one of which was restricted to subjects with sp ecific LBP (degenerative spondylolisthesis)282 and the other to subjects with nonspecific LBP (i.e., sacroiliac joint syndrome).285 Subjects with specific pain. Manipulation versus placebo . No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation versus no treatment. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation (type 1) versus manipulation (type 2). In one trial,282 fine adjusting manipulation was associated with a significantly greater therapeutic effect (percentage of pain free subjects) compared to that for the reduction manipulation in subjects with degenerative spondylolisthesis (60.0 percent versus 36.7 percent, p < 0.05).

No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation versus no treatment. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation (type 1) versus manipulation (type 2). In one trial, 285 although routine manipulation and manually assisted manipulation using Activator Adjusting Instrument (AAI) produced statistically significant reductions in pa in (NRS) and disability (Oswestry) for subjects with sacroiliac joint syndrome, the between-group differences for these outcomes were not significant. Manipulation versus other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation versus medication. No relevant studies were identified . Manipulation + other treatments versus the same other treatments . No relevant studies were identified. 94 4 - Manipulation + Mobilization for treatment of Low Back Pain There were 10 trials identified for this section. Results of six studies were reported in multiple publications (Table 3). Population/trial characteristics. These trials were conducted in Australia (two),39,56 Ireland (one),300 the Netherlands (one),84 Norway (one),299 UK (four),95,108,301,302 and US (one).66 The proportion of men and women were similar in eight trials.56,66,84,95,108,299,300,302 In one trial,39 the majority of subjects were females. The number of study participants in these trials ranged from 49299 to 74195 with a total of 2,838 subjects in all trials combined. Table 12 presents the control interventions in the included studies.

Risk of bias. The risk-of-bias graph for the trials included in this sub-section is presented in Figure 28. All trials were randomized. The adequate method of randomization and treatment allocation concealment was reported for 67.0 percent and 44.0 percent of the trials, respectively. Up to 89.0 percent of the trials reported that distribution of the subjects' baseline characteristics across the treatment arms was similar. The subjects were reported to be blinded in only 22.0 percent of the trials. About 78.0 percent of the trials reported acceptable drop-out rate. Results based on intention-to-treat analysis were explicitly reported for 44.0 percent of the trials. 95 Figure 28. Risk of bias scores Unclear Efficacy results. A summary of the key results is presented in Table 11. For more details please see evidence tables. (Appendix C, table 1.21 - table 1.27) Population with acute/subacute pain. There were two trials56,300 included in this sub\u00ad section. Both trials were restricted to subjects with LBP due to nonspecific causes. Subjects with specific pain.

Manipulation + mobilization versus medication. No relevant studies were identified . Manipulation + mobilization + other treatments versus the same other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Subjects with nonspecific pain. Manipulation + mobilization versus placebo . In one trial, 56 manipulation + mobilization was compared to double placebo (sham manipulation and placebo medication) and the results indicated nonsignificant differences in time to achieve recovery, post-treatment pain intensity (VAS), disability (RMDQ), and global perceived effects between the two groups. Manipulation + mobilization versus no treatment. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation + mobilization versus another type/method of the same CAM. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation + mobilization versus other treatments. In one trial, 300 post-treatment pain intensity (VAS, MPQ), quality of life (SF-36), disability (RMDQ), and range of mobility (e.g., flexion, functional activity) did not differ between the combination of manipulation and mobilization and inferential therapy at short- intermediate-, or long-term followup periods. In another trial, 301 patients in manipulation + mobilization group had significantly lower number of treatments to reach a symptom free status than those in microwave diathermy group. There was also a statistically significant difference between the intervention and control group in lumbar extension favoring manipulation + mobilization immediately post 3 weeks of treatment 96 (p < 0.05) but not for any other objective measures. \u0003In both trials, manipulation + mobilization treatments were delivered by experienced physiotherapists.

In one trail, 299 the manual therapy group showed significantly greater improvements than the exercise therapy group on pain intensity, functional disability, general health and return to work throughout the 2 months intervention in group of sick-listed patients. Immediately after the 2 month treatment period, 67 percent in the manual therapy and 27 percent in the exercise therapy group had returned to work (p < 0.01), a relative difference that was maintained throughout followup. In another trial, 39 motor control exercise (retraining specific trunk muscles using ultrasound feedback) and manipulation + mobilization produced slightly better short-term function (mean difference on Patient-Specific Functional scale: 2.30, 95 percent CI: 0.4, 4.2) and perceptions of effect (mean Global Perceived Effect difference: 1.20, 95 percent CI: 0.4, 2.0) than general exercise group, but not better intermediate or long-term effects,. There was no significant difference between the manipulation and motor control exercise in function (mean difference: 0.4, 95 percent CI: -1.5, 2.4) or global perceived effect (mean difference: 0.5, 95 percent CI: \u00ad0.2, 1.1).

In one trial,66 the combination of manipulation and mobilization (with or without physical modalities) was not significantly different from medical care alone or medical care combined with physical modalities (in reducing pain (VAS) and disability (RMDQ) at short, intermediate, and long-term time points post-treatment. Throughout the followup, the use of prescription drugs (e.g., NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, analgesics) was significantly greater in the medical care group versus manipulation group (at 6 months: 32.0 percent versus 24.0 percent). The mean number of doctor visits during 6 months of followup was greater among subjects in the manipulation versus medical care group (5.4 versus 2.9). Chiropractors administered the manual treatment in this trial. Similarly, another trial, 302 did not find any significant differences in disability (i.e., Disability Index) between subjects receiving osteopathic manipulation versus 'educational booklet.' In one trial,84 the combination of manipulation and mobilization produced significantly greater improvements in intermediate- and long-term post-treatment pain intensity(10-point scale: minimal severity = 1, maximal severity = 10) and physical functioning (10-point scale) compared to physiotherapy (exercise, massage, heat, electrotherapy, ultrasound, short-wave diathermy). The global perceived effect (six-point scale) did not differ between subjects who received manipulation plus mobilization and physiotherapy (intermediate-term post-treatment: 3.5 \u00b1 1.9 versus 3.5 \u00b1 1.8, p > 0.05). 84 The subgroup analysis of the same trial85 revealed that the beneficial effect of manipulation compared to physiotherapy was maximized in subjects with chronic pain (longer than one year) and in subjects younger than 40 years old. The manual therapy was delivered by physiotherapist who had an additional three years of training in manipulation. Manipulation + mobilization versus medication. No relevant studies were identified .

In one trial,108 the combination of manipulation and mobilization did not significantly improve immediate-, short-, or intermediate- term post-treatment lumbar mobility (flexion, extension, straight leg raising) compared to placebo (microwave at a very low setting). For example, mean values for extension in the combination and placebo groups immediately after the end of treatment were 42.96 \u00b1 9.09 and 44.43 \u00b1 11.38, respectively (p > The corresponding values for flexion were 2.40 \u00b1 10.30 and 22.75 \u00b1 9.62, respectively (p > 0.1).

Manipulation + mobilization versus another type/method of the same CAM. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation + mobilization versus other treatments. In one trial, 95 subjects receiving manipulation plus mobilization (delivered by trained chiropractor) had significantly improved long-term post-treatment pain (percentage of pain-free subjects), disability (Oswestry) and straight leg raising compared to those receiving conventional care. The use of analgesics did not differ between the two groups. The combination group had a significantly fewer subjects who were absent from work (percentage of subjects taking time off work) compared to the conventional care group. The subjects with severe disability at entry (Oswestry > 40.0 percent) responded more favorably than subjects with less severe disability at entry (Oswestry \u0094 40.0 percent).

All four trials recruited participants with nonspecific pain. Population/trial characteristics. All four trails were conducted in US. One of these trials was of particularly small sample size (only 13 subjects).303 Two of these trials reported information on ethnicity,304,305 and two trials reported the proportion of men and women in the trial.303,305 In total, there were 576 subjects randomize to flexion distraction technique therapy or control groups. The number of study participants ranged from 13 in one trial,303 to 235 in the largest trial.305 Control interventions were: x Placebo (two studies)303,304 x Other treatments (two studies) including physical modalities,297, and exercise305 The duration of treatments varied from 1 to 4 weeks. The frequency of treatments varied from twice a week to four times a week. Risk of bias. The risk-of-bias graph for the trials included in this sub-section is presented in Figure 29. All trials were randomized. The adequate method of randomization and treatment allocation concealment was reported for 25.0 percent and 50.0 percent of the trials, respectively. Up to 50.0 percent of the trials reported that distribution of the subjects' baseline characteristics across the treatment arms was similar. The subjects were reported to be blinded in 50.0 percent of the trials. All of the trials reported acceptable drop-out rate. Results based on intention-to-treat analysis were explicitly reported for 25.0 percent of the trials. 99 Figure 29. Risk of bias scores Population with acute/subacute pain.

Two trials were reported in six publications (Table 3). The results from seven studies that compared techniques of manipulation and mobilization are presented in this section.65,306-310 Results from two trials51,140comparing the effectiveness of manipulation and acupuncture are reported in the Acupuncture for Treatment of Neck Pain section. Population/trial characteristics. The trials were conducted in Australia (three), 51,140,311 Canada (five),309,312-315 China (one), 316 Denmark (one),317 Germany (one),308 South Africa (three),307,318,319 Nigeria (one),320 Spain (three),310,321,322 and United States (eight).65,306,323-328 The information on the country was not reported for two studies.329,330 There was a greater proportion of women ( \u0095 60 percent) versus men in eight studies,65,310,313,314,323,324,326,328 and greater proportion of men ( \u0095 60 percent) versus women in two studies.312,320 The proportions of men and women were similar in six studies.51,306,308,317,321,322 The gender distribution was not reported for six studies.309,311,315,325,329,330 Patients in the included trials were adults aged 18 or older. The information regarding ethnicity was reported for only five trials.65,320,323,327,328 In total 1,820 patients were included in these trials. The experimental intervention included spinal manipulation alone or in combination with other treatment (two studies).321,322 In one study,328 two different dosing regiments of spinal manipulation (two randomized arms) were used combined with other treatments. Control interventions for 29 trials with spinal manipulation or spinal manipulation + other treatments are displayed in Table 13. Table 13.

The risk-of-bias graph for the trials included in this sub-section is presented in Figure 30. All trials were randomized. The adequate method of randomization and treatment allocation concealment was reported for 52.0 percent and 34.0 percent of the trials, respectively. About 62.0 percent of the trials reported that distribution of the subjects' baseline characteristics across the treatment arms was similar. In 72.0 percent of the trials, study participants were not blinded to the treatment. About 66.0 percent of the trials reported acceptable drop-out rate. Results based on intention-to-treat analysis were explicitly reported for 41.0 percent of the trials. The data for selected items of the risk of bias tool across the CAM interventions (acupuncture; spinal manipulation; spinal mobilization; combination of manipulation and mobilization; and massage therapy) is displayed in table 7.2 of Appendix G. 103 Figure 30.

In total, there were four trials eligible for this section, all of which enrolled patients with nonspecific pain.308,314,315,322 Subjects with specific pain. Manipulation versus placebo . No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation versus no treatment. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation versus another type/method of the same CAM. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation versus other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation versus medication. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation + other treatments versus the same other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Subjects with nonspecific pain. Manipulation versus placebo . In one trial, 314 immediate post single treatment mean VAS scores indicated statistically significantly lower de gree of pain in patients receiving ipsilateral manipulation compared to placebo ultrasound (23.6 r 18.6 versus 46.5 r 21.8, p = 0.001). There was no difference between the applications of contralateral manipulation and placebo in lowering pain intensity (p = 0.93).314 Manipulation was administered by chiropractors. In another trial,308 manipulation delivered by trained chiropractors resulted in significantly lower pain intensity (VAS) compared with placebo (light hand placement on the side of neck without application of any side-different pressure or tension) immediately after the treatment (p = 0.01). Manipulation versus no treatment. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation versus mobilization. In one trial, 308 the post-treatment mean VAS scores were not statistically significantly different betw een the patients randomized to manipulation and those randomized to mobilization (p = 0.16; no other numerical data were reported). Manipulation (type 1) versus manipulation (type 2). In one trial,314 the application of ipsilateral manipulation led to a lower intensity of pain on VAS compared to contralateral manipulation (41.4 r 28.4, p = 0.0005). Immediate post-treatment results of another trial indicated that spinal manipulation did not differ from manipulation with mechanically-assisted device (VAS: 21.8 r 21.4 versus 20.4 r 18.4, respectively, p = 0.77). 315 Both treatments were performed by experienced chiropractors.315 Manipulation versus other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation versus medication. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation + other treatments versus the same other treatments. In one trial,322 patients randomized to receive a combination of thoracic spine manipulation and electro-thermal therapy compared to those randomized to electro-thermal therapy alone, experienced greater short-term post-treatment mean improvements in pain - VAS score (between-group mean score difference: 26.5, 95 percent CI: 22.9, 30.2) and disability - the Northwick Neck Pain Questionnaire (NPQ) (between-group mean score difference: 8.8, 95 percent CI: 7.5, 10.1). The treatments were performed by an experienced manual therapist. Population with chronic pain. A total of eight trials were included in this section. 51,140,311,316,317,326,328,329 All trials enrolled patients with nonspecific chronic neck pain. In four of these trials, the treatment of cervicogenic headaches was the primary goal.311,316,317,328 111 Subjects with specific pain. Manipulation versus placebo . No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation versus no treatment. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation versus another type/method of the same CAM. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation versus other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation versus medication. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation + other treatments versus the same other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Subjects with nonspecific pain. Manipulation versus placebo . In two studies, it was demonstrated that patients randomized to manipulation experienced significantly greater immediate post-treatment reduction in pain (measured on VAS, PPT) 326,330 and disability (measured on NDI)326 compared to patients randomized to placebo (hand maneuver without high velocity thrust in patients na\u00efve to spinal manipulation, 326 and sham ultrasound330). Treatments consisted of a single thoracic manipulation by physical therapists in one trial,326 and five cervical osteopathic interventions over a 10 week period in the other trial.330 In one trial,311 the use of cervical manipulation performed by a trained chiropractor was associated with significant increase in cervical ROM (extension, flexion, rotation) compared to sham manipulation for cervicogenic headache. 311 Manipulation versus no treatment. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation versus mobilization. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation (type 1) versus manipulation (type 2). One dose-response study,328 showed significantly better response in headache-related pain intensity (VAS score) and disability (Modified Von Korff scale) with a higher dose of manipulation (three to four chiropractor visits per week for 3 weeks) compared to one chiropractor visit (per week for 3 weeks) in short-term followup. Manipulation versus another type/method of the same CAM. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation versus other treatments. In one trial, 316 there was a significant improvement in pain intensity in the manipulation group versus TENS group (2.81 \u00b1 1.15 versus 5.26 \u00b1 1.83).316 Both groups improved in pain intensity and ROM compared to baseline but there was no difference in post treatment scores between the groups in ROM measures (1.17 \u00b1 0.86 versus 1.43 \u00b1 1.04). Another trial, 317 compared the effect of 3 weeks treatment with manipulation by registered chiropractors to that of low level laser and massage in patient with cervicogenic headaches. In this trial, the use of analgesics decreased by 36 percent in the manipulation group but was not changed in massage group. This difference was statistically significant (P = 0.04). This study also reported significantly greater improvement in number of headache hours per day in the manipulation group versus soft tissue massage group (decrease of 69 percent versus 37 percent, p = 0.03). 317 Manipulation versus medication. In one trial,329 although both manipulation (performed by a trained rheumatologist) and medication groups demonstrated improvement on mean VAS at 3 weeks (5.0 \u00b1 3.2 versus 1.8 \u00b1 3.1, P = 0.20), there was no significant difference between manipulation and medication (Diazepam) in short-term post-treatment reduction of pain (VAS). In contrast, findings from two other trials, 51,140 indicated a significant superiority of manipulation performed by experienced chiropractors over medication (e.g., NSAIDs, Celebrex, Vioxx, 112 Paracetamol) in immediate/short-term post-treatment pain intensity and disability (Oswestry scale, NDI).51,140 In one of these trials,51 the proportion of pain-free patients after the treatment was significantly higher in the manipulation group compared to the medication group (27.3 percent versus 5.0 percent, p = 0.05). Manipulation + other treatments versus the same other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Population with mixed duration of pain. This section included eight trials. 65,306,309,310,312,321,323,327 All except for one trial included subjects with nonspecific pain.321 Subjects with specific pain. Manipulation versus placebo . No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation versus no treatment. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation versus another type/method of the same CAM. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation versus other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation versus medication. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation + other treatments versus the same other treatments. In one trial,321 patients with whiplash injuries receiving manipulation of thoracic spine (performed twice in combination with physiotherapy on the 5th and 10th sessions) had significantly greater mean reduction in pain score (VAS) at immediate/short-term post-treatment followup compared to patients treated with physiotherapy alone which consisted of active exercise, electrotherapy, ultrasound, and manual therapy (2.27 r 0.87 versus 1.66 r 0.91, p = 0.002). Subjects with nonspecific pain. Manipulation versus placebo . In one trial, 312 patients randomized to a single cervical manipulation experienced significantly greater immediate post-treatment percent increase (40.0 percent-55.0 percent) in pressure pain threshold (PPT) around fixation level of 4 tender points compared to placebo (0-0.8 percent, p < 0.0001). In another trial, 310 spinal manipulation was more effective than sham treatment in patients with mechanical neck pain in improving pain (VAS) and cervical ROM. Manipulation versus no treatment. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation versus mobilization. Results regarding the comparison of manipulation and mobilization in terms of improvement in pain and disability were reported for 3 trials and were inconsistent. 65,309,310 For example, in one trial in 100 patients with unilateral mechanical pain, manipulation was found to be more effective (nonsignificant) than mobilization in immediate post-treatment improvement in pain intensity (NRS-101, VAS). 309 In a larger trial (336 patients),65 the intermediate-term post-treatment differences between the groups of manipulation and mobilization were clinically negligible and statistically nonsignificant with respect to pain intensity (NRS-11: -0.02, 95 percent CI: -0.69, 0.65) and disability (NDI: 0.46, 95 percent CI: \u00ad0.89, 1.82). In one trial, comparing two different modalities of the combined treatment of manipulation and mobilization (thrust versus nonthrust), thrust manipulation/ mobilization group achieved greater short-term post-treatment improvements in disability (between-group mean NDI score difference: 10.03, 95 percent CI: 5.3, 14.7) and pain intensity (between-group mean Numeric Pain Rating Scale score difference: 2.03, 95 percent CI: 1.4, 2.7) compared to nonthrust manipulation/mobilization group of patients. 306 Manipulation (type 1) versus manipulation (type 2). The effectiveness of manipulation based on endplay assessment and manipulation determined by sham was compared in one trial.327 The 113 between-group differences in immediate/short-term post-treatment pain (NRS, McGill Pain Questionnaire or MPQ, VAS, PPT) and disability (NDI) were statistically nonsignificant. Manipulation versus other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation versus medication. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation + other treatments versus the same other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation versus manipulation + other treatment. In one small trial323 of 6 subjects randomized to receive either manipulation alone or in combination with postisometric relaxation, no meaningful results were obtained regarding the between-group differences in immediate post\u00adtreatment disability (NDI score) or pain intensity (VAS score) due to small sample size. The manipulation alone group had a numerical favor over the combination group. Population with unknown duration of pain. This section included six trials comprising of patients with neck pain of unknown duration. 307,313,318-320,324,325 One of these trials enrolled patients with specific pain (facet syndrome, whiplash injury)319,320 and the remaining five trials - patients with nonspecific neck pain.307,313,318,324,325 Subjects with specific pain. Manipulation versus placebo . No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation versus no treatment. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation (type 1) versus manipulation (type 2). In one trial of 30 patients with facet syndrome,319 two approaches of manipulation (i.e., top segment adjustment in the direction of the restriction versus top and bottom segment adjustments in the direction of the restriction and the opposite direction, respectively) were compared in terms of short-term post-treatment reduction in pain intensity (NRS-101, MPQ-short form) and disability (NDI). Both groups had significantly improved pain and disability measures. The only between-group difference was observed for cervical forward flexion ROM in favor of the top and bottom segment adjustment technique. Manipulation versus other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation versus medication. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation + other treatments versus the same other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Subjects with nonspecific pain. Manipulation versus placebo . In one trial, 325 manipulation was compared to placebo with respect to immediate-term post-treatment reduction in pain intensity (VAS). In this trial, patients who received manipulation had a significantly greater mean reduction in VAS scores (15.5, 95 percent CI: 11.8, 19.2) than those who received placebo (4.2, 95 percent CI: 1.9, 6.6). Manipulation versus no treatment. In one trial, 324 manipulation groups had a modest improvement in cervical ROM or pain (VAS) compared to no treatment group. There was no significant difference between the manipulation and no treatment groups in immediate-term post\u00adtreatment pain intensity during left and right cervical rotation. 324 Manipulation (type 1) versus manipulation (type 2). In three trials,307,313,318 two different modalities of manipulation were compared. In the first trial,318 there was no significant difference in post-treatment pain (MPQ-short form, NRS-101), disability (NDI), or ROM between the two approaches of manipulation (cervical versus cervical/thoracic). In the second trial 313 there was a modest advantage in improving muscle strength (in pounds) for manipulation applied in the upper and lower spine compared to that applied only in the lower spine (19.6 \u00b1 6.5 versus 15.5 \u00b1 6.4, p = 0.05). The third study reported similar beneficial effect of cervical rotatory 114 manipulation compared to supine lateral break manipulation in immediate and short-term post\u00ad treatment followup for pain intensity a nd disability (NRS, MPQ-short-form, and NDI), and cervical ROM.307 Manipulation versus other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation versus medication. No relevant studies were identified. Manipulation + other treatments versus the same other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. 7 - Manipulation + Mobilization for Treatment of Neck Pain Two studies were included in this section, both of which were reported in multiple publications (Table 3). Population/trial characteristics. These studies were conducted in the Netherlands85and Australia.81 The proportion of females was greater (70 percent of all patients) for the Australian study.81 The treatment duration was 6 weeks in both trials. Manual therapy in these trials were compared with exercise, physiotherapy, and no treatment. Risk of bias. Both trials had fair risk of bias (i.e., scored two out of four on treatment allocation concealment, balance of baseline characteristics between the groups, patients' blinding status, and reasons/number of dropouts/withdrawals). Efficacy. A summary of the key results is presented in Table 14. For further detail of the trials please see the evidence tables. (Appendix C, table 2.9 - table 2.16) Population with acute/ subacute pain. No relevant studies were identified (see one study 85 in the Population with Chronic Pain sub-section). Population with chronic pain. Subjects with specific pain. No relevant studies were identified. Subjects with nonspecific pain. Manual therapy versus placebo . No relevant studies were identified. Manual therapy versus no treatment. No relevant studies were identified. Manual therapy versus medication . No relevant studies were identified Manual therapy versus other treatments . In the first trial,85the use of manual therapy (spinal manipulation + mobilization) led to a significantly greater improvement in the main complaint (pain, and/or physical functioning measured by a 10-point scale) when compared to physiotherapy (exercise, massage, heat, electrotherapy, ultrasound, shortwave diathermy) in patients with chronic or sub-acute nonspecific neck pain. The mean difference in physical functioning at 12 weeks followup between physiotherapy and manual therapy while adjusting for baseline differences was 1.9. The unadjusted mean improvements from baseline in physical functioning at 12 weeks for the manual therapy and physiotherapy groups were 4.8 and 3.4, respectively. The mean changes in cervical ROM (forward flexion, lateral flexion, extension) between the groups ranged from zero to five degrees which were neither clinically meaningful nor statistically significant. The long-term results (12 months post-treatment) 85,87 were reported for the combined sample of subjects with low back and neck pain and therefore are not presented in this review. In the second trial, 81,83 spinal manipulation plus mobilization with or without exercise (low load endurance exercises aimed to train muscle control of the cervico-scapular region) and exercise alone did not differ in the degree of reducing headache frequency (average number of headache days per week), intensity (VAS score: 0-10) and neck pain (percentage of patients who 115 improved \u0095 50 percent on a 10 point pain rating scale calculated from MPQ). However, all three active treatments were significantly better in reducing pain intensity and the frequency of headache than the control (i.e., no treatment) group (p < 0.001). In all active treatment groups, the median daily medication intake (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical code) at 12 months post\u00adtreatment were significantly decreased (93 percent - 100 percent) compared to baseline. In contrast, the daily median medication intake in the no active treatment group increased by 33.0 percent compared to baseline (p < 0.015). Population with mixed duration of pain. No relevant studies were identified. Population with unknown duration of pain. No relevant studies were identified. 116 8- Manipulation for Treatment of Thoracic Pain Only one trial335 was identified and included in this section. In this trial, 30 subjects with nonspecific thoracic pain of unknown duration were randomized to receive either manipulation or placebo (nonfunctional ultrasound) for 3 weeks. The outcomes of interest, assessed immediately or short-term (1 month) after the end of treatment were ROM of the thoracic spine (flexion, extension, rotation) and pain threshold. The study authors also assessed subjective measures of pain intensity (VAS, MPQ) and disability (Oswestry). Population/trial characteristics. This trial was conducted in the United Kingdom. The participants were men (47 percent) and women 16 - 55 years old. Half of study participants were 16 - 24 years old. Thoracic pain was located in mid section of thorax (T5 - T9) in 77 percent, and upper (T1 - T4) and lower sections (T10 - T12) of the thoracic spine in the remaining 23.0 percent. The intervention consisted of thoracic spine manipulation (n = 15) and the control consisted of nonfunctional ultrasound application which the study considered as placebo treatment (n = 15). The patients received treatment until they were free of symptoms or up to a maximum of 6 treatments during a minimum period of 2 weeks to a maximum period of 3 weeks with two to three treatments per week. A followup consultation for reassessment took place 1 month after the final treatment. Risk of bias. This trial was rated as high risk of bias. Neither randomization nor treatment allocation concealment could be ascertained. The care provider and outcome assessors were not blinded to the intervention. The dropout rates were not reported either. Efficacy. Please see Table 15 for the key efficacy results. Immediately after the end of treatment, there were statistically significant differences for right and left lateral flexion measures, between the manipulation and placebo groups, in favor of manipulation (p < 0.025). After 1 month of followup, the between-group differences for all the ROM measures were not statistically significant at = 0.025 (p > 0.025). The immediate post-treatment mean pain score (VAS) was significantly lower in the manipulation versus placebo group (21.9 \u00b1 11.4 versus 35.6 \u00b1 14.2, p = 0.014). Meanwhile, pain and disability scores of MPQ and Oswestry scales were not significantly different between the two groups of subjects. At 1 month of followup, only pain measured on MPQ was significantly lower in the manipulation versus placebo group (0.08 \u00b1 0.18 versus 0.13 \u00b1 0.11, p = 0.03). 117 Table 15 - Key Results - Manipulation therapy for thoracic pain CAM therapy Duration of pain Cause of pain Outcome Risk- of- bias Precision of the pooled estimate Consistency Directness Finding GRADE Man vs. PL Acute/sub\u00ad acute S - - - - - - Insufficient NS - - - - - - Insufficient Chronic S - - - - - - Insufficient NS - - - - - - Insufficient Mixed S - - - - - - Insufficient NS - - - - - - Insufficient Unknown S - - - - - - Insufficient NS VAS: B 335 H - NA Direct > SS Low MPQ: B 335 H - NA Direct = S-NS Low MPQ: C 335 H - NA Direct > SS Low Oswestry: B 335 H - NA Direct = S-NS Low ROM (right/left lateral flx): B 335 H - NA Indirect > SS Low ROM (flx, ext, rotation): C 335 H - NA pain intensity; NA=not applicable 118 Grade (High, moderate, low, and insufficient) B = immediate post-treatment C = short-term post-treatment D = intermediate-term post-treatment E = long-term post-treatment H = high L = low M = medium - No evidence = Similar beneficial effect > Favors treatment A over treatment B < Favors treatment B over treatment A ><, =>, <= Inconsistent beneficial effect 119 9- Mobilization for Treatment of Low Back Pain This section included 18 trials. One trial was reported in two publications (Table 3) Population/trial characteristics. The studies were conducted in Australia (three),336-338 Canada (one),279, Bulgaria (one),339 China (one),340 Finland Sweden Thailand (one),347 United Kingdom, (one)348 and United States (four).55,349-351 The proportion of men and women was similar in nine studies, 55,336,338-341,343,344,348 and differed (> 60.0 percent men or women) in six trials.279,337,345,347,350,351 Two studies included either only women346 or only men.349 Information on gender was not reported for one study.342 The trials recruited adults with the mean age ranging from about 20.0 years349 to 47.0 years.336 Table 16 presents the control interventions in the included studies.

This information was not clearly reported for four studies.55,340,346,348 Risk of bias. The risk-of-bias graph for the trials included in this sub-section is presented in Figure 31. All trials were randomized. The adequate method of randomization and treatment allocation concealment was reported for 38 percent and 19 percent of the trials, respectively. Only about half of the trials reported that distribution of the subjects' baseline characteristics across the treatment arms was similar. In 69.0 percent of the trials, study participants were not blinded to the treatment. Up to 63.0 percent of the trials reported acceptable dropout rate. Results based on intention-to-treat analysis were explicitly reported for 31.0 percent of the trials. The data for selected items of the risk of bias tool across the CAM interventions (acupuncture; spinal manipulation; spinal mobilization; combination of manipulation and mobilization; and massage therapy) is displayed in table 7.1 of Appendix G.

There were four trials, of which, three trials studied subjects with nonspecific pain55,339,349 and one - subjects with cause-specific pain (i.e., pelvic joint dysfunction.346 Subjects with specific pain. Mobilization versus placebo . In one trial,346 consisting of mostly women (96.0 percent) affected by sacroiliac joint dysfunction, there was no statistically significant difference in post\u00ad treatment pain intensity and lumbar mobility between subjects in the mobilization and placebo (massage therapy consisting of manual transverse frictions of the gluteus medius muscle) groups. The median number of analgesic pills taken was significantly higher in the placebo group (median: 3.5, range: 0-54) compared to mobilization group (median: 0, range: 0-132). The median duration of sick leave (in days) was also significantly greater in the placebo (median: 14, range: 0-26) versus mobilization group (median: 7, range: 0-35). Mobilization versus no treatment. No relevant studies were identified. Mobilization versus another type/method of the same CAM. No relevant studies were identified. Mobilization versus other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Mobilization versus medication. No relevant studies were identified. Mobilization + other treatments versus the same other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Subjects with nonspecific pain. Mobilization versus placebo . No relevant studies were identified. Mobilization versus no treatment. In one trial, 349 mobilization was compared to no treatment in post-treatment pain and disability. Immediately or short-term after the end of treatment, mobilization group had significantly lower pain scores (VAS, MPQ; p = 0.001) compared to 'no treatment' group. Mobilization versus another type/method of the same CAM. No relevant studies were identified. Mobilization versus other treatments. In one trial, 339 immediate or intermediate-term post-treatment pain intensity was significantly lower in the mobilization group compared to electro-stimulation, traction, or medication group. Mobilization versus medication. No relevant studies were identified. Mobilization + other treatments versus the same other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Mobilization versus manipulation. In one trial,55 2 weeks after the randomization, the manipulation group of subjects had a significantly better disability score (RMDQ) compared to the mobilization group. Population with chronic pain. Seven trials were included in this sub-section,.279,341,343\u00ad 345,347,351 Of these, six trials studied subjects with nonspecific LBP and one trial included post- laminectomy patients.351 Subjects with specific pain. Mobilization versus placebo . No relevant studies were identified. Mobilization versus no treatment. Immediate and short-term post-treatment degree of disability (Oswestry score) did not differ between the mobilization and no treatment groups. 351 Mobilization versus another type/method of the same CAM. No relevant studies were identified. 126 Mobilization versus other treatments. Immediate and short-term post-treatment degree of disability (Oswestry score) did not differ between the subjects who received mobilization and physiotherapy (physical modalities including exercise).351 Mobilization versus medication. No relevant studies were identified. Mobilization + other treatments versus the same other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Subjects with nonspecific pain. Mobilization versus placebo. No relevant studies were identified. Mobilization versus no treatment. Kaltenborn's wedge assisted posteroanterior mobilization was shown to be significantly superior to 'no treatment' in improving pain (VAS: p < 0.001), back bending mobility (right side: p < 0.004, left side: p < 0.02), and disability (RMDQ: p < 0.003). 345 Mobilization versus another type/method of the same CAM. No relevant studies were identified. Mobilization versus other treatments. In two trials, mobilization (traditional bone setting technique) was compared with physiotherapy (massage, therapeutic stretching, trunk stabilization exercise, and exercise therapy) in terms of pain intensity (VAS), disability (Oswestry), back mobility (lateral bending), qua lity of life (HRQoL-15D questionnaire), and global assessment (scores from -1 to +10). 341,343 In one of these trials,343 scores for 1 month post-treatment global assessment and quality of life were better in the mobilization compared to physiotherapy group. Based on the results from two meta-analyses (Figures 32-33), subjects with chronic nonspecific LBP in the mobilization groups had significantly reduced immediate post-treatment pain intensity (pooled mean difference in VAS score: -0.50, 95 percent CI: -0.72, -0.28) 95 percent CI: -5.91, -3.96) 341,343 compared those in the physiotherapy groups. According to a meta-analysis of the same trials (Figure 34),341,343 the mean difference in finger to floor distance (in cm) between the mobilization and placebo groups was not statistically significant (pooled mean difference: -0.89, 95 percent CI: -1.89, 0.12) In one trial,344 there was no difference between subjects in the mobilization versus physiotherapy or exercise (light back movements) groups with respect to immediate and intermediate-term post-treatment pain intensity (VAS), ROM (modified Schober's test; extension in degrees), and straight leg raising. In this study mobilization was performed by folk-healers practitioners who had no formal medical education. 127 Figure 32.

Mobilization versus massage In one trial,347 short-term post-treatment effects of mobilization and massage on pain were compared. The post-treatment pain intensity (VAS) was slightly but significantly greater in the mobilization group compared to the massage group (3.36 \u00b1 0.25 versus 2.48 \u00b1 0.25, p = 0.017). Population with mixed duration of pain. Six trials were included in this sub-section. 336\u00ad 338,342,348,350 All of these trials enrolled subjects with nonspecific LBP in whom the effect of 128 mobilization was compared to that of 'no treatment',337 placebo,348 exercise,342,350 or physiotherapy.342 In two trials,336,338 two delivery modes of mobilization were compared (therapist-selected levels versus randomly selected levels).

Subjects with nonspecific pain. Mobilization versus placebo . In one trial, 348 mobilization did not significantly differ from placebo (consisted of patients lying in a comfortable position with no manual intervention applied) in reducing immediate or short-term post-treatment pain intensity (VAS) or spinal ROM (flexion, extension, finger-to-floor). There was a small but a statistically significant difference in favor of mobilization (versus placebo) for improving spinal ROM (true flexion: 49.2\u00ba \u00b1 16.4 versus 45.3 21.5, p = 0.005) immediately after the treatment. The intervention was provided by experience physiotherapist trained for mobilization for movement techniques. Mobilization versus no treatment. In one trial, 337mobilization did not significantly differ from 'no treatment' in reducing immediate or short-term post-treatment pain intensity (VAS) or spinal ROM (flexion, extension, finger-to-floor). Mobilization (type1) versus mobilization (type2). In one of the two trials, 336,338comparing therapist-selected levels to randomly selected levels of mobilization, current pain intensity was significantly reduced in the therapist-selected group (1.34, 95 percent CI: 1.02, 1.66) compared to the random group (0.88, 95 percent CI: 0.52, 1.24).338 The reduction in pain (NRS-11) was greater for subjects whose most painful movement was flexion (as opposed to extension, lateral flexion). The post-treatment spinal ROM (fingertip-to-floor, flexion, extension, lateral flexion, worst movement) or global perceived effect did not differ between the groups. 338 In contrast, results from the other trial,336 indicated no significant difference between the two types of mobilization in terms of immediate pain reduction (NRS-11: 1.3 \u00b1 1.4 versus 1.2 \u00b1 1.7, p > 0.05). Significant interaction effects were found for the most painful movement direction for the left (p = 0.006) and right lateral flexion (p = 0.02). A series of meta-analyses based on the above-mentioned trials (Figures 35-41) 336,338 did not show any significant differences between the two modalities of mobilization for mean improvement in pain intensity (pooled mean reduction in VAS score: 0.29, 95 percent CI: -0.06, 0.64), global perceived scale (0.20, 95 percent CI: -0.23, 0.62), extension (pooled mean change in degrees: 0.01, 95 percent CI: -0.83, 0.85), flexion (pooled in degrees: 0.90, 95 percent CI: 0.16, 1.96), and finger to floor distance (pooled mean change in degrees: 0.88, 95 percent CI: -0.12, 1.88). Similarly, the pooled estimates for differences between mean changes of the two groups for right lateral flexion (0.14, 95 percent CI: -0.51, 0.79) and percent CI: -0.35, 0.96) were not statistically significant. 129 Figure 35.

Results from two trials comparing mobilization to a press up exercise indicated either no significant difference between the two in reducing pain (VAS) and lumbar ROM (total lumbar extension) immediately after the end of a single treatment350 or a slight numerical difference in favor of mobilization (bone-setting) (versus exercise) in reducing disability (Oswestry) at intermediate-term after the end of 6 weeks treatment (manual, thermal, and electrotherapies according to the Finnish routine) within-group reductions: 5.9 percent, p = 0.009 versus 6.2 percent, p = 0.02, respectively). 342 In the second trial,342 there was no difference between bone-setting and physiotherapy in terms of reduction of the Oswestry disability score (within-group reductions: 4.7 versus 4.0). In this trial, reduction in number of sick leaves was not statistically or clinically significant between the three groups during one year post intervention. The average number of visits to health centers for back pain decreased in all groups, with significant changes only in physiotherapy (mean change from year before therapy = 0.5 compared with 0.1 in bone setting, and -0.1 in exercise group, p < 0.1). 342 Mobilization versus medication.

In one trial, 355 post-treatment mean VAS scores were not significantly different between mobilization and placebo (hand placement without movement of vertebral segment) groups (p = 0.09). However, the mobilization group had a significantly greater PPT mean score compared to the placebo group. Mobilization versus no treatment. In one trial, 355 post-treatment mean PPT and VAS scores in the mobilization group were significantly greater compared to no treatment group (p < 0.001 and p = 0.04, respectively). Mobilization versus another type/method of the same CAM. No relevant studies were identified 139 Mobilization versus other treatments (including CAM). In one trial,353 subjects who received bone setting experienced significantly greater improvements in pain intensity (PPT, VAS) and disability level (NDI) compared to patients who received physiotherapy (massage, therapeutic stretching, and exercise therapy) or traditional massage. Moreover, patients in the bone-setting group during 1 year of followup had a lower number of sick leave days (0.61 per person) compared to those in the physiotherapy (2.6 per person) or the traditional massage group (3.9 per person). Similarly, the bone-setting group had a greater percent decrease in the use of analgesics compared to physiotherapy and traditional massage groups (65.7 percent, 50.0 percent, and 56.2 percent, respectively). Mobilization versus medication. No relevant studies were identified. Mobilization + other treatments versus the same other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Population with mixed duration of pain. There were eight trials included in this section. 62,65,309,310,352,354,356,357 Only one trial included patients with pain due to specific cause - neurogenic disorder.354 In these trials clinical benefits/harms of mobilization were compared to those of no treatment,352 manipulation,65,309,310 mobilization,357 placebo,354, continued GP care,62 physiotherapy,62 or analgesic medication.356 Results from three trials where mobilization is compared to manipulation,65,309,310 are also presented in the Spinal Manipulation, Mixed Duration Neck Pain sub-sections. Subjects with specific pain. Mobilization versus placebo . No relevant studies were identified. Mobilization versus no treatment. No relevant studies were identified. Mobilization versus another type/method of the same CAM. No relevant studies were identified. Mobilization versus other treatments. In a small trial of 20 patients diagnosed with neurogenic cervicobrachial pain,354 the efficacy of mobilization performed by physical therapist was compared to pulsed ultrasound applied over the painful area. The application of mobilization technique was associated with statistically significant immediate post-treatment improvement compared to baseline in pain intensity on VAS (from 7.3 r 1.8 to 5.8 r 2.1, p = 0.005) and cervical ROM (from 137.3 r 15.4 to 156.7 r 10.7, p = 0.0005). In contrast, in control group, the corresponding within-group changes in VAS (from 7.7 r 1.9 to 7.4 r 1.8, p = 0.16) and ROM (from 130.2 r 14.7 to 130.7 r 16.0, p = 0.78) were not significant. Statistical test results for the inter-group comparisons (mobilization versus placebo) were not provided.354 Mobilization versus medication. No relevant studies were identified. Mobilization + other treatments versus the same other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Subjects with nonspecific pain. Mobilization versus placebo . No relevant studies were identified. Mobilization versus no treatment. In one study,352 the use of bone-setting resulted in a significantly greater proportion of improved subjects (> 50 percent improvement in VAS) compared to control group (neither offered nor denied treatment) after 5 weeks (p = 0.04) and 6 months ( p = 0.002) of treatment. This difference was not statistically significant after one year (p = 0.2). In this trial slight self-rated improvement compared with baseline was reported after 5 weeks by 20/21 subjects in the massage group versus 3/17 subjects in the control group (p < 0.001). These rates were 15/20 versus 6/18 (p = 0.01) after 5 weeks, and 16/20 versus 5/18 (p = 0.002) after one year. There were no statistically significant differences between bone-setting 140 and the no treatment group in the annual number of pain medications taken (63 r 146 versus 188 r 332, p = 0.1) and the number of sick leave days (4.5 r 20.0 versus 16.9 r 53, p = not reported).352 Mobilization (type 1) versus mobilization (type 2). One trial,357 comparing an immediate post-treatment effect of randomly chosen mobilization versus preferred mobilization, showed similar degree of global perceived effect (an ordinal 7-point scale; ranging from 1 = completely recovered to worse than ever = 7) and pain intensity (VAS) between the two groups. The same trial indicated the preferred mobilization group being superior to randomly chosen mobilization group with respect to cervical flexion ROM (p = 0.024). Mobilization versus other treatments. In one trial, 62 spinal mobilization led to statistically significant improvement in pain intensity (VAS) compared to GP care which consisted of counseling and advice on staying active, role of psychosocial factors, self-care such as heat application, home exercises, and ergonomic advice (mean difference 0.9, 95 percent CI: 0.1, 1.5) but not to physiotherapy including specific exercises (mean difference 0.3, 95 percent CI: -0.6, 1.2) in short term followup. At the same followup, there was no significant difference for disability (NDI) between the treatment groups. At 52 weeks, spinal manipulation faired statistically significantly better than physiotherapy (mean difference 1.0, 95 percent CI: 0.1, 1.9) in improving pain intensity (VAS), but not compared to GP care (mean difference 0.5, 95 percent CI: -0.4, 1.3). Mobilization versus medication. No relevant studies were identified. Mobilization + other treatments versus the same other treatments . In one trial, 356 short-term post-treatment analgesic effect of mobilization and medication (Premaspin 0.5 g daily) was significantly greater compared to the same medication alone (pain free subjects: 48 percent versus 12 percent, p < 0.05). Population with unknown duration of pain. Subjects with specific pain. Mobilization versus placebo . No relevant studies were identified. Mobilization versus no treatment. No relevant studies were identified. Mobilization (type 1) versus mobilization (type 2) . In one trial, 320 there was a significantly (p < 0.001) higher proportion of pain-free subjects in the anterior-posterior unilateral pressure (63.0 percent) and posterior-anterior unilateral pressure (46.0 percent) groups compared to subjects in the cervical oscillatory rotation (17.0 percent) and transverse oscillatory pressure groups (25.0 percent).

There were five trials eligible for the inclusion in this sub-section, all of which studied subjects with sub-acute LBP of nonspecific cause.101,360,361,363,366 Subjects with specific pain. Massage versus placebo. No relevant studies were identified. Massage versus no treatment. No relevant studies were identified. Massage versus another type/method of the same CAM. No relevant studies were identified. Massage versus other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Massage versus medication. No relevant studies were identified. Massage + other treatments versus the same other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Subjects with nonspecific pain. Massage versus placebo. In two trials, 360,361 the use of massage produced significantly lower immediate or short-term post-treatment pain intensity (VAS, MPQ) and disability scores (Oswestry, RMDQ) compared to placebo (minimal but continuous suction delivered by device, 360 and sham laser361). For example, in one of these trials,361 the short-term post-treatment mean RMDQ scores in the massage and placebo groups were 2.86 \u00b1 3.1 and 6.5 \u00b1 4.2, respectively (p < 0.001). The corresponding values for pain intensity on the Pain Rating Index (PRI) were 4.5 \u00b1 5.7 and 7.7 \u00b1 6.0, respectively (p = 0.006). The massage and placebo groups did not differ in post-treatment lumbar ROM. 361 One of these trials employed a single treatment design.360 Massage versus no treatment. In one trial,360 the effect of a single massage treatment (roptrotherapy - deep cross-friction massage with a copper myofascial T-bar) was compared to that of 'no treatment,' showing (Oswestry: \u00b1 5.0 versus 31.0 versus 12.0, p < 0.001) amongst the massage-treated subjects compared to those in 'no treatment' group at short-term post-treatment followup (1 week post-treatment). Massage versus another type/method of the same CAM. No relevant studies were identified. Massage versus other treatments. Massage was compared to other treatments in four trials. 101,361,363,366 In the first trial,361 comprehensive treatment of massage plus exercise and postural education was shown to produce significantly greater short-term post-treatment improvements in pain intensity (PRI, VAS) and disability (RMDQ), compared to massage (soft\u00adtissue manipulation), or remedial exercise alone. In the same trial, immediate or short-term post\u00adtreatment lumbar ROM did not differ across the massage, soft-tissue manipulation, and remedial exercise groups. Similarly, in the second trial, 101 the magnitude of improvement immediately post-treatment in pain intensity (VAS), extension and flexion (using Schober method), or maximum voluntary extension effort (MVEE) was not significantly different in the massage versus spinal manipulation, TENS, or corset group. In the third trial, 363 one year after the end of treatment, subjects who received underwater massage, underwater traction, or balneotherapy did differ in the use of analgesic pills (# taken daily: 2.3 \u00b1 1.7 versus 2.1 \u00b1 1.2 versus 1.9 \u00b1 1.8, respectively) or pain intensity 45.8 \u00b1 26.2 versus 25.7, respectively). In the fourth trial, 366 acupressure on eight fixed acupoints with aromatic lavender essential oil (performed by a nurse trained in Chinese medicinal nursing) significantly improved short-term post-treatment pain intensity (VAS: 0.61 versus 0.99, p = 0.0001), walking time (in seconds: 0.91 versus 1.03, p = 0.05), and lateral fingertip-to-floor distance (in centimeters: 0.96 versus 1.01, p = 0.01) compared with usual care. There was no significant difference between the two groups for post-treatment pain duration (in hours: 0.76 versus 1.05, p = 0.08). 150 Massage versus medication. No relevant studies were identified. Massage + other treatments versus the same other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Population with chronic pain. There were 11 trials that were included in this section.29,41,90,347,364,365,368-372 Additional results (acupuncture versus massage) from one trial29 are reported in the Acupuncture, Chronic LBP sub-section. Results of one trial347 are presented in the Mobilization (Chronic LBP) sub-section. All trials included subjects with pain due to nonspecific causes. Subjects with specific pain. Massage versus placebo. No relevant studies were identified. Massage versus no treatment. No relevant studies were identified. Massage versus another type/method of the same CAM. No relevant studies were identified. Massage versus other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Massage versus medication. No relevant studies were identified. Massage + other treatments versus the same other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Subjects with nonspecific pain. Massage versus placebo. In one trial, 368 subjects randomized to massage (reflexology) had numerically similar degree of improvement in intermediate-term post-treatment pain intensity (VAS: 2.2 versus 3.3, MPQ: 6.0 versus 7.5), disability (MRDQ: 4 versus 3.5), and health status (SF-36: physical functioning and bodily pain) compared to subjects in the placebo group. Placebo intervention in this trial included light pressure foot massage which was avoided on the points used for intervention group. Note that this was a pilot study and it was not adequately powered to detect a pre-specified difference. Massage versus no treatment. The immediate and intermediate-term post-treatment effects of massage (reflexology) and 'no treatment' with respect to pain (VAS), disability (Oswestry), global health perception, and physical/social functioning (SF-36) were compared in one trial. 369 Although subjects in both groups improved in all outcomes, there was no significant between- group difference after the end of treatment. Massage versus another type/method of the same CAM. No relevant studies were identified. Massage versus other treatments. In three trials, massage370,372 or reflexology369 was compared to relaxation therapy in terms of post-treatment reduction in pain intensity (VAS, MPQ), disability (Oswestry), global health perception, physical/social functioning (SF-36), stress (mood , anxiety), and/or lumbar ROM (trunk flexion). In two of the three trials, 370,372 massage was shown to produce significantly lower pain intensity, improved depression/anxiety score, ROM, and sleep compared to relaxation therapy, immediately after the end of treatment. In contrast, the third trial 369 did not demonstrate any significant immediate (or intermediate-term) post-treatment differences in pain (immediate post-treatment VAS: 29.8 \u00b1 19.6 \u00b1 22.3) (SF-36: 53.9 \u00b1 27.8 versus 57.1 \u00b1 30.2 ) between the massage versus relaxation therapy groups. In one trial, 90 at 1 year post intervention, the groups receiving exercise followed by Alexander technique lessons (six or 24 lessons plus exercise prescription from a doctor, and counseling from a nurse) significantly improved in disability compared to subjects receiving six sessions of massage (mean difference from baseline in RMDQ: -3.40, 95 percent percent CI: -1.94, 0.77 for 24 and six lessons of Alexander technique, and massage, respectively). 151 The meta-analyses based on pooled results of two trials370,372 were performed to quantify and compare the effects of massage and relaxation with respect to improving pain intensity (VAS score) and trunk flexion (touch toe without pain in cm) in subjects with chronic nonspecific LBP (Figures 44-45). The result of one meta-analysis indicated a significantly lower pain intensity in the massage compared to relaxation group (pooled mean difference on VAS score: -1.27, 95 percent CI: -2.46, -0.08). Although the difference with respect to trunk flexion was numerically in favor of massage over relaxation, this difference did not reach the traditional level of statistical significance (pooled mean difference: 2.21, 95 percent CI: -1.10, 5.52).

In one of these trials, 365 the intermediate-term post-treatment mean pain intensity score in the massage group was significantly lower compared to that in the PT group (SF-PQ: 1.08 \u00b1 1.43 versus 3.15 \u00b1 3.62, p = 0.0004). The magnitude of benefit of massage relative to PT did not differ across age and gender groups. 365 The meta-analysis of two trials364,365 restricted to subjects with chronic nonspecific low back pain showed a statistically significant difference in favor of massage over physical therapy in 152 Figure 46 .

One trial demonstrated significantly lower pain intensity (VAS) and disability (HFAQ) scores for subjects after receiv ing acupuncture massage compared to Swedish massage followed by individual exercise.41 In another trial,29 immediate post-treatment symptom bothersomeness scale (p = 0.02) and disability (RMDQ; p < 0.001) scores were better in the massage versus self-care group. After a 1 year followup, these differences were not significant (p = 0.42 and p = 0.97, respectively). In one study, 371 subjects who received the combination of massage and specific exercise had a numerically lower immediate post-treatment pain intensity (VAS score) compared to those who received specific or nonspecific exercise alone. In the specific exercise group the post-treatment disability was significantly increased versus pre-treatment disability. Massage versus medication. No relevant studies were identified. Massage + other treatments versus the same other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Massage versus standard therapy. In one trial, 90 the effectiveness of massage was compared to that of normal care in improving pain intensity, disability (RMDQ), and quality of life (SF\u00ad36). In this trial, there were significant reductio ns for all intervention groups in RMDQ disability score and days in pain at 3 months followup. However, no differences were observed in the disability scores between the massage and standard care groups. Population with mixed duration of pain. This sub-section included three trials. 295,362,367 One trial362 included subjects with LBP due to specific cause (i.e., disc herniation), and one trial367 subjects with nonspecific LBP.

Results of two trials are also presented in the Acupuncture, Chronic Duration Neck Pain77 and Mobilization, Chronic Duration Neck Pain353 sections. Population/trial characteristics. The trials were conducted in Australia (one),43 China, (three)246,247,375 Germany, (one)77 Spain (two),376,377 Taiwan (one),378 Turkey (one),379 United Kingdom (two),380,381 and the United States (three).382-384 All studies included adults of 18 years or older. The proportion of women and men were similar in two studies.375,376 In eight studies, the proportion of women (> 60 percent) was greater than that of men,43,77,377-379,382-384 and in one study, the proportion of men was greater than that of women (> 60 percent).246 In two studies, the proportions of men and women were similar.247,381 The proportion of men/women could not be ascertained for one study.380 In one study, the majority of patients were Caucasians.383 In trials conducted in China, the study participants' ethnicity was assumed to be Asian,246,247,375 No ethnicity information was reported for the remaining studies. In total, 1,104 patients were included in these trials and 676 of them were randomized to massage only43,77,246,247,352,376-384 or to massage + other intervention.247,375,378,384 Table 22 presents the control interventions in the included studies.

Risk of bias. The risk-of-bias graph for the trials included in this sub-section is presented in Figure 47. All trials were randomized. The adequate method of randomization and treatment allocation concealment was reported for 38.0 percent and 19.0 percent of the trials, respectively. Only a half of the trials reported that distribution of the subjects' baseline characteristics across the treatment arms was similar. In 56.0 percent of the trials, study participants were not blinded to the treatment. About 63.0 percent of the trials reported acceptable drop-out rate. Results based on intention-to-treat analysis were explicitly repor ted for 44.0 percent of the trials. The data for selected items of the risk of bias tool across the CAM interventions (acupuncture; spinal manipulation; spinal mobilization; combination of manipulation and mobilization; and massage therapy) is displayed in table 7.2 of Appendix G. 156 Figure 47.

There was one trial evaluating the effectiveness of massage given to patients with subacute neck pain.381 Subjects with specific pain. Massage versus placebo. No relevant studies were identified. Massage versus no treatment. No relevant studies were identified. Massage versus another type/method of the same CAM. No relevant studies were identified. Massage versus other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Massage versus medication. No relevant studies were identified. Massage + other treatments versus the same other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Subjects with nonspecific pain. Massage versus other treatments or placebo . This trial included patients with nonspecific neck pain who were randomized to receive trigger point therapy, myofascial band therapy, or placebo (ultrasound). 381 Although the trial authors measured pain intensity (NRS-11, PPT) and cervical ROM, the results were reported on a dichotomous scale (i.e., odds ratios, number needed to treat) instead of continuous scale (i.e., mean scores). The patients treated with trigger point therapy were seven times more likely to improve in terms of pain reduction (decrease of at least two points on NRS-11) compared to patients treated with myofascial band therapy or placebo (odds ratio: 7.4, 95 percent CI: 1.22, 45.02). 381 Massage versus no treatment. No relevant studies were identified. Massage versus another type/method of the same CAM. No relevant studies were identified. Massage versus other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Massage versus medication. No relevant studies were identified. Massage + other treatments versus the same other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Population with chronic pain. A total of four trials restricted to patients with specific (whiplash injuries, myofascial pain syndrome) 77,379,382 and nonspecific neck pain,383 were included in this sub-section. Subjects with specific pain. Massage versus placebo. In one trial,77 patients with whiplash and myofascial pain syndrome who received massage had lower pain intensity compared to those in sham laser group (VAS: 7.89 versus 17.28, p < 0.05). Massage versus no treatment. In one trial,382 immediate post-treatment mean NPQ score was significantly lower in the massage group (13.24 \u00b1 11.88) compared with that in no treatment group (35.64 \u00b1 12.54). The patients who received massage had a slight but only numerically greater cervical ROM extension (49.38 \u00b1 13.71) and flexion (50.0 \u00b1 3.74) compared to those who had not received any treatment (extension: 46.80 \u00b1 13.60, flexion: 44.1 \u00b1 12.28). Massage versus another type/method of the same CAM. No relevant studies were identified. Massage versus other treatments. There was one trial evaluating the clinical benefits of massage compared with vapocoolant spray in the treatment of patients with chronic myofascial pain syndrome. 379 The application of massage did not differ from vapocoolant spray in reducing immediate post-treatment pain on VAS (2.60 \u00b1 1.73 versus 2.88 \u00b1 1.50) or increasing cervical ROM (flexion, extension). The only significant difference was observed for rotation to left in favor of spray versus massage (78.65 versus 72.45, p < 0.05). 379 In another trial,382 immediate post-treatment mean NPQ score was significantly lower in the massage group (13.24 \u00b1 11.88) compared to that in the exercise group (20.23 \u00b1 12.06). In this 161 trial, patients who received massage had a slight but only numerically greater cervical ROM extension (49.38 \u00b1 13.71) and flexion (50.0 \u00b1 3.74) compared \u00b1 11.8, flexion: 48.62 \u00b1 14.04). Massage versus medication. No relevant studies were identified. Massage + other treatments versus the same other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Subjects with nonspecific pain. Massage versus placebo. No relevant studies were identified. Massage versus no treatment. No relevant studies were identified. Massage versus another type/method of the same CAM. No relevant studies were identified. Massage versus other treatments. In one trial, 383 there was no difference in immediate and intermediate-term post-treatment degree of disability between patients who received 10 weeks of massage and self-care instruction (16 weeks post-treatment difference in NDI mean score: -1.9, 95 percent CI: -4.4, 0.63, p = 0.14). At 16 weeks post-treatment, the use of medication, which was similar in the groups at baseline, increased by 14.0 percent in the self-care group but did not change in the massage group. 383 Massage versus medication. No relevant studies were identified. Massage + other treatments versus the same other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Population with mixed duration of pain. A total of six trials restricted to patients with specific (whiplash injury, spondylosis, spondylopathy, myofascial pain syndrome)246,247,375,376 and nonspecific380 neck pain of mixed duration (acute, sub-acute, chronic) were included in this section. Subjects with specific pain. Massage versus placebo. No relevant studies were identified. Massage versus no treatment. No relevant studies were identified. Massage versus another type/method of the same CAM. No relevant studies were identified. Massage versus other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Massage versus medication. No relevant studies were identified. Massage + other treatments versus the same other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Massage alone versus massage (combined or alone). In one trial,376 40 patients with myofascial pain syndrome experienced equal immediate post-treatment clinical benefit in terms of pain intensity reduction after being randomized to receive either ischemic compression (PPT: 2.2 r 0.6 and VAS: 3.8 r 0.9) or transverse friction massage (PPT: 2.35 r 0.4 and VAS: 4.2 r 0.4; for both outcomes between-group p > 0.40). In two trials246,247 of patients with spondylosis or spondylopathy, massage combined with either acupoint injection247 or needle scalpel246 produced statistically significantly greater rates of cure (post-treatment absence of symptoms and physical signs) compared with massage alone. Massage + other treatment versus other treatment. In one Chinese study,375 the combination of massage and traction was compared to traction alone in subjects with spondylopathy. The immediate post-treatment improvement score (measured using Cervical Spondylopathy Therapeutic Effect Rating Scale) but not effective rate (subjects with improved clinical and body symptoms but partially affected daily activit ies) was significantly higher in the massage combination versus traction alone group (0.50 \u00b1 0.16 versus 0.36 \u00b1 0.14, p < 0.01). 162 Subjects with nonspecific pain. Massage versus placebo. No relevant studies were identified. Massage versus no treatment. No relevant studies were identified. Massage (type 1) versus massage (type2). In one trial, 380 the effectiveness of ischemic compression and trigger point pressure release was compared. In this trial, patients had similar post-treatment pain intensity (VAS, PPT) across the randomized groups. For example, the effect on mean VAS scores was similar (p > 0.10) for patients treated with ischemic compression (22.9 r 12.7) versus sham ultrasound (22.6 r 8.2). Likewise, no between-group differences (p > 0.10) were found in relation to the mean pain pressure threshold (PPT) scores (4.45 r 1.69 versus 3.77 r 1.76 versus 3.37 r 1.62). 380 Massage versus other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Massage versus medication. No relevant studies were identified. Massage + other treatments versus the same other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Population with unknown duration of pain. A total of four studies were included which enrolled patients with specific (myofascial trigger point syndrome),43,378,384 or nonspecific 377 cause. Subjects with specific pain. Massage versus placebo. In one trial,43 the application of manual pressure to trigger points (to patient's pain tolerance level) sustained for 60 seconds resulted in a statistically greater improvement compared to sham myofascial release (p < 0.001). Massage versus no treatment. No relevant studies were identified. Massage (type 1) versus massage (type2). In one trial, 384 single treatment with either occipital release (O/R), active head retraction with extension exercises , or no treatment did not differ in reducing sensitivity (PPT in kg/cm2) of cervical and scapular trigger points (2.5 r 1.1 versus 2.8 r 1.3 versus 2.6 r 1.5, p = NR). In another trial,378 immediate effects of ischemic pressure applied at two intensities (low pressure = at pain threshold, high pressure = at averaged pain threshold and tolerance) were measured. The use of ischemic compression therapy with low pressure (90 seconds) and high pressure (60 - 90 seconds) was associated with a significant reduction of pain (VAS), elevation of pain tolerance, and improvement of ROM compared to that of ischemic compressions with low or high pressure at shorter durations (p < 0.05). Massage versus other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Massage versus medication. No relevant studies were identified. Massage + other treatments versus the same other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Subjects with nonspecific pain. Massage versus placebo. No relevant studies were identified. Massage versus no treatment. In one trial, 377 both classical and modified strain/counterstrain techniques produced significantly better immediate post-treatment pain intensity scores (VAS) compared to no treatment in subjects with nonspecific neck pain (p < 0.001). The 'no treatment' group in this study did not experience any change from baseline in the pain intensity measure (p > 0.30). Massage (type 1) versus massage (type2). In one trial, 377 local pain elicited by application of 4.5 kg/cm2 of pressure on the tender points improved after a single treatment with either classical or modified strain/counterstrain technique in subjects with nonspecific neck pain. However, the 163 difference in immediate post-treatment VAS scores between the two classical and modified strain/counterstrain groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.8). Massage versus other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Massage versus medication. No relevant studies were identified. Massage + other treatments versus the same other treatments. No relevant studies were identified. Cost Effectiveness In total 10 trials were included for cost-effectiveness of CAM treatment for LBP24,72,94,112,125,385,386, and neck pain.63,89,130 The trials recruited patients with nonspecific pain (Table 24 and 25). Low Back Pain We identified 10 studies.24,29,72,94,112,125,224,278,385,386 Of these 10 studies, seven were reports of full economic evaluations of the cost-effectiveness of spinal manipulation72,125,385,386, acupuncture,24,112 and massage 94 for low back pain. The three remaining studies had not performed a full economic evaluation by combining differences in costs and effects of the two (or more) compared alternatives and therefore were excluded from the review. 29,224,278 Population/trial characteristics. The studies were conducted in Finland,385 Germany,24 Sweden,386 United Kingdom,94,112,125 and United States.72 The mean age ranged from 37 to 54 years and the proportion of men and women were balanced in all trials. In total, 5,984 participants with nonspecific LBP were included in these seven trials. The duration of pain was acute in one trial, 386, chronic in three trials,24,94,385 and mixed in three trials.72,112,125 Acupuncture. Ratcliffe et al,112 compared individualized acupuncture treatment for 3 months from acupuncturists trained in traditional Chinese medicine with usual care. The study population consisted of patients with subacute and chronic low back pain. The total costs of health care utilization during 2 year followup were higher in the acupuncture group ($859) compared with the usual care group ($645). The difference in health gain was .012 QALY at 1 year and 0.027 QALY at 2 year followup. The incremental cost-utility ratio was $7931 per QALY gained. From the health services perspective, the acceptability curve showed that acupuncture had a more than 90 percent chance of being cost-effective at a $37,400 (GBP 20,000) per QALY threshold. The study showed that, from societal perspective (including costs of health care utilization, patient costs and costs of productivity losses) acupuncture was more dominant (i.e. less costly and more effective) compared with GP care. Witt et al, 24 conducted an economic evaluation alongside a large randomized trial (N=3093) comparing acupuncture with no treatment (delayed acupuncture) in patients with chronic low back pain. The difference in QALYs at 3 months between the acupuncture and control group was 0.03. The costs of acupuncture were higher than the costs of the control group; mean difference at 3 months was $423 (95 percent CI: 224, 622) in total costs, and $461 (95 percent CI: 342, 579) in back pain specific costs. The incremental cost-utility ratios were $15,895 (Euro 10,526) per QALY gained for overall costs and $17,321 (Euro 11,470) per QALY gained for back pain specific costs. At a threshold of $22,662 (Euro 15,000) per QALY acupuncture had a more than 90 percent chance of being cost-effective. 164 Spinal manipulation. Four full economic evaluations on spinal manipulation were identified.72,125,385,386 In a large randomized control study 72 that recruited patients from a large medical group practices (HMO), the authors compared four treatments: chiropractic care (spinal manipulation), chiropractic care plus physical modalities (heat, cold, ultrasound, and electrical muscle stimulation provided by chiropractor), medical care, and medical care plus physical therapy. (Table 22) The study population consisted of 681 acute, subacute or chronic low back pain patients. The authors conducted a cost-minimization analysis, given that that previously published findings showed no clinically meaningful difference in effects between these four treatments. The results showed that the adjusted mean outpatient costs of low back pain in 18 months were $765 for medical care plus physical therapy, $565 for chiropractic plus physical modalities, $550 for chiropractic, and $463 for medical care. The authors concluded that costs were higher for chiropractic care compared with medical care without producing better clinical outcomes. Physical therapy in addition to medical care does not seem to be a cost-effective strategy for low back pain. However, the authors did not include in their analyses pharmaceutical costs and costs of production loss. Niemisto, 385 compared a combined intervention of physician consultation, spinal manipulation and stabilizing exercises to physician consultation alone in 204 patients with chronic low back pain. The economic evaluation was conducted from a societal perspective. Costs of health care consumption and costs of productivity loss were included. There were no statistically significant differences in costs between the two groups. The incremental cost of the combination treatment compared with the physician consultation only for one point improvement on pain intensity (100 mm VAS) was $23. Seferlis et al, 386 conducted a cost-minimization analysis of manual therapy, general practitioner care, and intensive training, since a previously conducted randomized trial had not identified any statistically significant differences in clinical effects between the three interventions. The study population consisted of patients with acute low back pain. Direct and indirect costs were included. The results showed that direct costs per patient were $1,054 for manual therapy, $404 for GP care, and $1,123 for intensive therapy. Indirect costs per patient were $6,163 for manual therapy, $7,072 for GP care, and $5,556 for intensive therapy. Finally, the total costs per patient were $7,217 for manual therapy, $7,476 for GP care, and $6,680 for intensive therapy. This study did not report any quality of life or additional cost of drug outcomes. There were no statistically significant differences in costs between the groups. The UK BEAM trial, 125 compared the cost-effectiveness of adding spinal manipulation, exercise classes, or manipulation followed by exercis e (combined treatment) to \"best care\" in general practice for patients with subacute and chronic low back pain. Results showed that adding spinal manipulation to GP care was effective in improving QALY compared to GP care alone, and would cost $ 8880 per QALY gained from the health sector's perspective. In contrast, adding both spinal manipulation and exercise to GP care did not statistica lly significant improve QALY compared to GP care alone, but would only cost $7030 per QALY gained. The authors concluded that spinal manipulation in addition to GP care appeared relatively cost-effective compared to GP care alone from the health sector's perspective. 125 Massage. Hollinghurst et al,94 reported an economic evaluation of therapeutic massage, exercise, Alexander technique and usual GP care in patients with chronic and recurrent low back pain. The authors used a 4 X 2 factorial design in which participants were randomized to one of eight groups. Total NHS costs over 1 year (costs of interventions, GP visits, other primary and secondary care, and medication) were $460 (\u00b1 364) for the massage group (n=64), $97 (\u00b1 165 for GP care without exercise (n=60), $388 (\u00b1 260) for 6 sessions of Alexander technique without exercise (n=53), $1,087 (\u00b1 467) for 24 sessions of Alexander technique without exercise (n=61), $427 (\u00b1 190) for 6 sessions of Alexander technique with exercise (n=57), $1,177 (\u00b1 585) for 24 sessions of Alexander technique with exercise (n=56), $476 (\u00b1 647) for massage with exercise (n=56), and $275 (\u00b1 932) for GP care with exercise (n=51). Exercise had the highest probability of being the most cost-effective first choice of therapy. The acceptability curves showed that if exercise is the first choice, at a threshold of GBP $18,000 per QALY, the chance that a second intervention is cost-effective is 80 percent. 166 Table 24.

These trials were reported in multiple publications 62,63; 89,92; and 130,131 (Table 23) Population/trial characteristics. The trials were conducted in Germany,130, the Netherlands,63 and the United Kingdom.89 In total, 3,984 participants with mixed nonspecific neck pain were included. The mean age of participants ranged from 45 to 53 years and the proportions of men and women were not significantly different in any of these trials. Acupuncture. Willich et al,130 performed cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses alongside a randomized controlled trial comparing additional acupuncture compared with usual care alone in patients with chronic neck pain. Subjects in the usual care group received acupuncture treatment after the 3 months study period. Adults with chronic neck pain (> 6 months) were included. A total of 3,451 subjects were randomized to either acupuncture (n=1,753) or usual care (n=1,698). The mean (SD) QALYs over 3 months followup were 0.649 (0.096) in the acupuncture group and 0.625 (0.103) in the usual care group, with a mean difference of 0.024 (p=0.004). Acupuncture treatment was associated with significantly higher total costs over 3 months of followup compared to usual care ($1,157 versus $810); the mean difference in total costs was $347 (95 percent CI: 220, 477). This difference in cost was mainly due to costs of acupuncture ($452). The incremental costs-effectiveness ratio was $15.710 per QALY; the net benefit of acupuncture was $1147. Spinal manipulation. Lewis et al, 89 conducted cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses alongside a randomized controlled trial (Diedzic et al) comparing advice and exercise plus manual therapy (n=114) and advice and exercise plus pulsed shortwave diathermy (n=121) with advice and exercise alone (n=115) for patients with nonspecific neck pain. Experienced physiotherapists provided all interventions. The results showed that the mean improvement in neck pain (VAS) at 6 months was 10.2 in the manual therapy group, 10.3 in the pulsed shortwave diathermy group and 11.5 in the advice and exercise group. The mean quality adjusted life years (QALY) scores for the treatment three groups were 0.342, 0.360, and 0.362, respectively. The mean health care costs were $190, $197 and $169 and the mean total costs were $486, $543 and $598, respectively. From the health care perspective, the cost-effectiveness acceptability curves showed that the probability of each intervention being cost-effective at the $48,000 per QALY threshold was 0.37 for manual therapy, 0.31 for pulsed shortwave diathermy and 0.32 for advice and exercise alone. From the societal perspective, these probabilities were 0.44, 0.26 and 0.30, respectively. Although the authors concluded that the interventions of choice are likely to be manual therapy or advice and exercise alone, and that pulsed shortwave diathermy is unlikely to be a cost-effective intervention, the probabilities that any of these interventions is cost-effective are very low. Korthals-de Bos et al, 63 conducted an economic evaluation alongside a randomized controlled trial (Hoving et al)62 to evaluate the cost effectiveness of manual therapy (n=60), physiotherapy (individualized exercise therapy, active and postural or relaxation exercises, stretching, and functional exercises; n=59), and care by a general practitioner (n=64) for subjects with nonspecific neck pain. Study participants were treated by the general practitioners, physiotherapists, or manual therapists. Manual therapy provided faster improvement compared with physiotherapy and general practitioner care up to 26 weeks, but there were no statistically significant differences at 52 weeks of followup. The total costs of manual therapy ($402) were 169 around one third of the costs of physiotherapy ($1,166) and general practitioner care ($1,240). These differences were statistically significant for manual therapy versus physiotherapy and manual therapy versus general practitioner care, but not for general practitioner care versus physiotherapy. 170 Table 25.

For any of the CAM Therapies Found to be Effective for Back Pain, what Patient, Treatment Provider and Trial Specific Factors Influence Success of Treatments? Subgroup Analysis The amount of evidence regarding factors potentially influencing treatment effect (e.g., age, gender race, education, income, cause of pain, type of treatment provider, dose of treatment) was relatively limited. Effects of treatment related factors such as duration, frequency (number of sessions) are explored qualitatively if reported in the efficacy and effectiveness sections for dose response studies (see Chapter 3). Qualitative analysis. We identified only seven trials that included age-specific populations (i.e., elderly), 45,53,207,208,216,217,226,227 Six trials that included women only219,263 or men only.144,284,349 (see Table 26). Of these, nine trials were conducted to assess the effects of acupuncture in subjects with low back pain.53,144,207,208,216,217,219,226,227 The results of trials across these subgroups were not comparable due to different control treatments and/or duration/cause of pain in subjects included in these trials. In one trial reporting subgroup effects of manipulation in subjects with mixed duration of low back pain. 34,81 The subject's age, gender, symptom duration, or the therapist's years of experience did not have a significant effect on the mean change for Oswestry score between two groups receiving spinal manipulation in addition to exercise and exercise alone. Within the spinal manipulation group, subjects positive on the rule (4/5 of the above criterion) had a significantly greater improvement on Oswestry score compared to subjects negative on the rule (immediately and short-term post-treatment: 10.3, 95 percent CI: 2.2, 18.4, p < 0.014). 81 In the same study, patients with LBP of mixed duration who were judged to have lumbar hypomobility experienced greater benefit from spinal manipulation than subjects without hypomobility (mean difference, 23.7 percent, 95 percent CI: 5.1, 42.4). Subjects with lumbar hypermobility receiving a program of stabilizing exercise had a greater benefit than subjects without hypermobility (mean difference, 36.4 percent, 95 percent CI: 10.3, 69.3). 34 In one trial reporting subgroup analysis of subjects with chronic nonspecific low back pain,365 the beneficial effect of massage compared to physical therapy (physical modalities, exercise and traction) was similar across age (\u0094 50 years: p = 0.0023 and > 50 years: p = 0.0221) and gender groups (male: p = 0.0356, female: p = 0.001). However, the short term post-treatment effect of massage differed across baseline pain severity groups (VAS \u0094 8: p = 0.179, and VAS > 8: p = 0.0001). Specifically, massage was significantly better in reducing pain intensity compared to physical therapy but only in subjects with severe pain at baseline (immediately post\u00adtreatment mean VAS: 2.84 \u00b1 3.13 versus 8.19 The intermediate-term (6 months post-treatment followup) effect of massage compared to physical therapy was significantly more beneficial and was not different across the severity groups (VAS \u0094 8: p = 0.0319, and VAS > 8: p = 0.0016). Quantitative analysis. We were not able to conduct the analysis quantitatively due to insufficient data. The largest meta-analysis of this review included only 10 trials (acupuncture versus placebo for chronic nonspecific low back pain; (see Figure 4) and the remaining smaller meta-analyses included a range of two to four trials. The pooled trials did not include solely subjects from the subgroups of interest. 172 Table 26.

We explored the impact of study quality (risk-of-bias) on the pooled effect estimate of mean pain score difference between acupuncture and placebo. Initially, the 10 trials were categorized into two groups: 'higher risk-of-bias' and 'lower risk-of-bias.' If for a trial, seven or more items of the risk-of-bias tool were rated as 'Yes' this trial was categorized into 'lower risk-of-bias' group, otherwise into 'higher risk-of-bias' group. Thus, there 'lower risk-of-bias' trials 22,37,197,206 and six 'higher risk-of-bias' trials.99,141,156,198,203,228 The pooled effect estimates for the two categories of trials were -0.43 (95 percent CI: -0.76, -0.09) -1.39, -0.11), respectively (Figures 48-49). This analysis suggests that the quality (risk of bias) of trial did not appreciably modify the effect of acupuncture compared to placebo in subjects with chronic nonspecific low back pain. 174 Figure 49.

Does the Use of any of the Three Most Prevalent Types of CAM for Back Pain in Adults Result in a Decreased or Increased Utilization of Conventional Management? Low Back Pain The comparative data on days off work, medication use, and health care utilization reported for 16 trials of low back pain are presented in Tables 27\u00ad 29.22,24,29,31,53,66,95,111,112,143,202,342,346,369,385,391 Acupuncture. In the first trial,202 there was no statistically significant difference between subjects in acupuncture and placebo groups in the post-treatment number of days off work. The mean (or median) number of pain medication pills per unit of time (day of week) was significantly lower in subjects who received acupuncture compared to those who received placebo (mean number of pills per day: 1.0 \u00b1 0.3 versus 4.2 \u00b1 0.6) 202 or TENS (median number of pills per week: 15 versus 28).53 Subjects receiving acupuncture had significantly lower number of days using analgesics compared to subjects receiving no treatment or placebo.22 The time to return to full time work and number of pills consumed was significantly shorter/lower for subjects receiving electro-acupuncture compared to subjects receiving manual acupuncture (no numerical data were given). Subjects receiving acupuncture did not significantly differ from subjects receiving self-care in the number of medication fills (4.4 \u00b1 8.9 versus4.0 \u00b1 8.6), provider visits, or imaging tests per year. 29 Similar results were obtained in another study that compared acupuncture to usual care for chronic nonspecific patients in a 2 year study. One trial,111 reported numerically lower proportions of any medication users amongst subjects in the acupuncture versus usual care groups (40.0 percent versus 59.0 percent). Manipulation. Most studies reporting the data on days off work, medication use, and health care utilization indicated nonsignificant differences between the groups of spinal manipulation and exercise (days off work), 31 physician consultation (days off work, healthcare utilization),385 medical care (pain medication use: proportion of users or number of pills),66 or placebo (pain medication use: proportion of users or number of pills).39 Mobilization. In one trial in subjects with low back pain and sciatica due to sacroiliac joint dysfunction, the median number of analgesic pills taken was significantly higher in the placebo group (median: 3.5, range: 0-54) compared to mobilization group (median: 0, range: 0-132). 346 The median duration of sick leave (in days) was also significantly greater in the placebo (median: 14, range: 0-26) versus mobilization group (median: 7, range: 0-35). 346 In another trial including patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain, the number of patients on sick leave decreased in three groups of patients randomized to bone setting, physiotherapy and exercise. There were no significant differences in proportion of patients on sick leave in the year before the intervention compared to the year after the intervention between the three groups. In this study, the average number of visits to health centers for back pain was reduced in all three groups, but was only significant in physiotherapy group. 342 (Table 26) Massage. There were no statistically significant differences in pain medication use (e.g., proportion of patients using medications) and number of provider visits between subjects who received massage versus relaxation or self-care at end of treatment. 29,369 176 Table 27.

The number of analgesics consumed by subjects receiving acupuncture did not significantly differ from that consumed by subjects receiving Botulinum toxin127 or Lidocaine injection.126 The proportion of patients not taking rescue medication was significantly greater in the acupuncture versus placebo group (RR = 4.0, 95 percent CI: 2.3, 7.0).259 In another trial,271 the mean percent decrease in analgesic use was significantly greater in the local acupuncture versus remote acupuncture group (37.0 percent versus 9.0 percent). Manipulation. No relevant trials were identified. Mobilization. In two studies, analgesic medication use (i.e., percent decrease in annual use, mean annual number of doses) and the mean number of sick leave days were numerically better (no statistical test results reported) in the mobilization group versus no treatment352 or physiotherapy (massage, stretching, and exercise).35 Massage. In the massage groups of two trials,353,383 the use of pain medication was significantly lower compared to the self-care book (mean increase: 0 percent versus 14.0 percent respectively) 383 but not significantly different compared to physiotherapy group (mean decrease: 56.2 percent versus 50.0 percent, respectively).353 184 Table 30.

The Egger's regression-based analysis 16 yielded a statistically significant result (p = 0.03). 188 KQ2 - What are the Contraindications and Safety Profile of the Three Most Prevalent CAM Therapies for Back Pain in Adults Compared to That for Other CAM Therapies, Conventional Therapies, Placebo or no Treatment? Does the Safety Profile of These Therapies Change Across Subgroups of Patients With Comorbidities? Harms of CAM in RCTs 1 - Acupuncture for Treatment of Low Back Pain Any information on harms was reported for 25 trials.22,24,29,37,49,53,110,121,136,138,139,143,156,162,197,198,198,200,207,209,216,220,224,226,228 Most reported events that were of moderate and transient nature. Specific adverse events reported by subjects who received acupuncture were soreness/pain at the site of needling, 22,24,29,49,110,121,136,156,162,198,198,207,224,226,228 headache.136 In one trial,143 reportedly no needle-induced adverse events had occurred. In two trials, the proportion of subjects with any adverse events did not differ between acupuncture and placebo groups.22,37 For example, in one of these trials,22 10.7 percent (15/140) and 17.1 percent (12/70) of subjects reported any adverse events for the acupuncture and the placebo group, respectively (p = 0.20). One trial 228 reported 3.8 percent (6/147) of the subjects in the acupuncture having an adverse event versus none in the placebo group (p = 0.04). In another trial, 207 one patient in acupuncture group (n=13) reported deterioration of symptoms and withdrew from the trial. There were seven patients in the acupuncture (n=32) and four patients in the placebo (minimal needling) group (n=28), respectively who reported bleeding. 156 The proportion of subjects with at least one adverse event was similar in acupuncture and usual care (or conventional treatment) groups.37,49,220,226 Subjects in usual care groups had epigastric pain,139,220,226 nausea,139 poor appetite,139 or headache.136,139,226 In one of these trials,220 the medication group reported higher proportion of gastroenteric adverse events compared with the acupuncture group (15/29 versus 0/28, p < 0.01). In three trials, 53,121,216 the incidence of adverse events in acupuncture (or electro-acupuncture) and TENS was numerically similar. In one of these trials,53 there were 16.6 percent (5/30) and 14.8 percent (4/27) of the subjects who had an adverse event. In the other trial,216 one patient dropped out due to deterioration of symptoms after receiving the combination of acupuncture and TENS. In one trial, 29 11 percent (10/94) of patients in the acupuncture group and 13 percent (10/78) in the massage group reported \"significant discomfort or pain\" during or shortly after treatment. In another trial, 200 comparing acupuncture plus exercise to exercise alone, one patient in the combination group (n=26), developed stroke. Three patients in one trial did not tolerate pain during tapping in the dermal needling group (n=88) and were excluded without receiving the treatment. 162 One patient experienced itching with electrode (acupuncture with electric stimulation group; n=31) and one patient had dullness after treatment with TENS (n=33).209 189 In one trial,136 the proportions of subjects with an adverse event in the high-frequency acupuncture (five times per week) and the low-frequency acupuncture (two times per week) groups were 73.3 percent (11/15) and 46.6 percent (7/15), respectively (p-value not reported). In four trials, reportedly no serious adverse events occurred in acupuncture versus massage,29 usual care110 'no treatment,'24,29 or placebo (sham-acupuncture) group.197 For one trial,37 after 6 months of followup, 40 and 12 serious adverse events were reported for the acupuncture (n=387) and the usual care group (n=388), respectively. Similarly, another trial, 22 reported 9.3 percent (13/140) and 5.7 percent of (4/70) of the subjects had serious adverse events in the acupuncture and placebo groups, respectively. 2 - Acupuncture for Treatment of Neck Pain Only 13 trials reported any information on adverse events.45,46,51,77,80,128,131,235,256,257,259,262,272 The reporting of adverse events in these trials was generally poor (i.e., inconsistent, not enough detail, not well defined, no numerical or statistical data). For example, in two trials 45,262 comparing acupuncture to Lidocaine injection, no severe adverse events were observed262 and one patient treated with acupuncture (n=18) withdrew from the trial due to cholecystectomy.45 The proportions of patients with soreness in the acupuncture and Lidocaine injection groups were 50.0 percent (9/18) and 38.1 percent (8/18), respectively (p = 0.74). 45 In the same trial, none of the subjects who received acupuncture developed dizziness or haemorrhage, whereas there were two subjects each with either dizziness or haemorrhage in the Lidocaine injection group (0 percent versus 4.8 percent). In seven trials, the proportions of patients who withdrew or those reporting adverse events were similar in acupuncture (range: 6.0 percent-33.0 percent) versus placebo (TNS) groups (range: 0 percent-21.0 percent). 77,80,128,256,257,259,272 The patients who received acupuncture reported the following events: needle reaction, mild headache, euphoria, enhanced vision, dizziness, mild hypotonia, sweating, swelling of the hand, bruising, and ulcer of the ear, 77,80,128,259 whereas patients in the placebo groups reported cephalea,259 aggravation of symptoms,128,256,259 tiredness, nausea, tingling in the thumb, or uncomfortable cold feeling from the electrodes.128 No serious adverse events were reportedly noted.77,80 In one trial,51 no adverse events were reported for patients receiving acupuncture (n=34) or manipulation (n=35); In total, about 6.1 percent (4/40) patients who were treated with medications (e.g., 200-400 mg/d Celebrex, 12.5-25.0 mg/d Vioxx) had indigestion, abdominal pain, or skin rash. In another trial, 131 8.3 percent (n=1005) of the patients treated with acupuncture (both randomized and nonrandomized: n=12148) developed adverse events (minor local bleeding or hematoma, needing pain, or vegetative symptoms). No post-needling soreness, hypotension, or hematoma was observed in two other trials comparing acupuncture alone to the combination of acupuncture either with electro\u00adstimulation 235 or paraspinal needling.46 3 - Manipulation for Treatment of Low Back Pain Any information on harms was reported for only four trials.276,288,290,296 The reported adverse events were mostly moderate in severity and of transient nature. Most commonly reported specific event in subjects randomized to manipulation was increased pain or soreness. 276,290,296 In the first trial,276 there were four and three subjects with worsening of LBP in the manipulation 190 (n=35) and exercise (n=37) groups, respectively. In the second trial,290 there were six and four subjects with an adverse event in the manipulation (n=47) and myofascial therapy (n=50) groups, respectively. One subject in the myofascial therapy group developed constant tinnitus.290 In one trial,288 no adverse events were registered except for one subject (group identity not reported) who had constipation after consuming 24 Codeine Phosphate capsules in the first 4 days. Another trial 296 reported the absence of serious adverse events in subjects with subacute or chronic LBP randomized to manipulation (n=191) or muscle relaxants; n=49). The number of two manipulation groups (high-velocity low-amplitude and low-velocity variable-amplitude; n=191) was 16 (15 events of low back soreness/pain) compared to four adverse events (rash due to Celebrex, headache, leg cramps/pain across chest, slurred speech) in the standard treatment group (n=49). 4 - Manipulation + Mobilization for Treatment of Low Back Pain Only three trials reported any harms related data.39,56,66 In one trial,39 reportedly no adverse events had occurred. In another trial,66 no treatment- related adverse events requiring institutional review board notification had occurred. One trial reported the absence of serious adverse events in subjects receiving manipulation (n=59). 56 In the same trial, 22 subjects (11 subjects in the medication - NSAIDs, analgesics group and 11 subjects in placebo group) reported dizziness, gastrointestinal disturbances, and heart palpitations. 56 One patient in the medication group (n=60) had a suspected hypersensitivity and withdrew from the trial. 5 - Flexion Distraction for Treatment of Low Back Pain Only one trial305 reported any information on harms. In this study, reportedly no adverse event had occurred during the study period. 6 - Manipulation for Treatment of Neck Pain Only six trials reported any information on adverse events.51,65,306,320,323,329 The reporting of adverse events in the majority of these trials was generally poor (i.e., inconsistent, not enough detail, not well defined, no numerical or statistical data). Results for one trial are presented in the Acupuncture section, Harms sub-section. 51,52 In one trial of 280 patients comparing manipulation to mobilization,65,69 after 2 weeks of treatment, patients randomized to manipulation (n=171) were at statistically nonsignificantly increased risk for having any adverse event (adjusted OR = 1.44, 95 percent CI: 0.85, 2.43) compared to patients randomized to mobilization (n=165). Most frequently reported events were neck soreness/stiffness (27.7 percent versus 22.3 percent), radiating pain (6.4 percent versus 5.8 percent), tiredness (12.1 percent versus7.9 percent), headache (15.6 percent versus 15.8 percent), and dizziness (4.3 percent versus 2.2 percent). Another trial, 329 reported proportions of patients with at least one adverse event in the manipulation plus Diazepam group and the Diazepam group alone were 9.5 percent (2/21) and 11.1 percent (2/18; superficial phlebitis), respectively. There were reportedly no serious adverse events in one trial306 in patients randomized to the combination of manipulation and mobilization with (n=30) or without thrust (n=30). There were 191 nine and ten patients reporting mild-to-moderate severity adverse events in the nonthrust and thrust groups, respectively (p = 0.67). In one trial,323 two subjects, one in the manipulation (n=3) and the other in the manipulation combination group (n=3) experienced transient but severe neck pain/stiffness. 7 - Manipulation + Mobilization for Treatment of Neck Pain In one trial,81,83 although there were no important adverse events, 6.7 percent (not specified the number of subjects or a treatment group - manipulation plus exercise: n=49, manipulation alone: n=51) of the subjects reported provoked headaches as a result of the intervention. 8 - Mobilization for Treatment of Low Back Pain None of the reviewed trials provided any information on the absence or presence of harms reported by subjects. 9 - Mobilization for Treatment of Neck Pain Any information on adverse events was reported for two studies.320,357 In the first study, none of the patients reported any adverse events.357 In the other trial,320 posterior-anterior unilateral pressure (PAUP), anterior-posterior pressure (APUP), transverse oscillatory pressure (TOP), and cervical oscillatory rotation (COR) techniques did not worsen the patients' condition. The relapse rates in the TOP and COR treatment groups after 3 months were 8.0 percent (2/24) and 12.0 percent (3/24), respectively. 10 - Mobilization for Treatment of Thoracic Pain None of the reviewed trials provided any information on the absence or presence of harms reported by subjects. 11 - Massage for Treatment of Low Back Pain Any information on harms was reported only for four trials.90,366-368 For two trials,366,368 it was explicitly stated that no adverse events had occurred during the treatment period. In one trial, 90 one subject reported worsening of back pain in the massage group (n=75) as opposed to no adverse events reported for the group of exercise (n=72) or Alexander technique lessons (n=73). In another trial, 367 five to 10 subjects from each group (Thai-massage: n=90 versus Swedish massage: n=90) reported soreness of transient nature which disappeared in 5-10 minutes. There were five additional subjects in the Swedish massage group (n=90) who reported allergic reaction (rashes and pimples) to the massage oil. 367 12 - Massage for Treatment of Neck Pain Only two studies reported any information on adverse events.77,383 In one trial,77 the proportion of patients with adverse events in massage group was numerically lower 7.0 percent 192 (4/57) compared to acupuncture 33.0 percent (17/51) or placebo-laser 21.0 percent (12/57). No serious adverse events were observed in this trial. In the other trial,383 nine patients randomized to massage (n=32) had mild adverse events (discomfort or pain: n = 5, increased soreness post\u00adtreatment: n = 3, and nausea: n = 1). Harms Reported in Nonrandomized Controlled Studies This review identified five nonrandomized studies and one experimental controlled trial,224 The nonrandomized studies included two cohorts,392,393 and three case-control studies6,394,395 that reported on the incidence of harms in subjects receiving CAM therapies. Acupuncture for Treatment of Low Back Pain Although one study,224 was a trial that compared subjects with acute nonspecific LBP randomly assigned to usual care or choice of CAM care (acupuncture, massage, and chiropractic therapy), the occurrence of harms was reported only for the three groups of subjects who chose to receive acupuncture, chiropractic therapy, or massage within the choice of CAM care group (n = 300). The post-treatment rates of minor (clinically in-significant) discomfort or soreness in the acupuncture, chiropractic therapy, and massage groups were 5.0 percent (3/58), 8.0 percent (6/76), and 7.0 percent (10/152), respectively. No further details of harms were described. Manipulation and Mobilization for Treatment of Low Back Pain In a retrospective cohort study,392 the rates complications were compared between two groups of subjects with nonspecific LBP of unknown duration who had received either mobilization plus manipulation (n=75) or no therapy (n=75). Findings showed no differences in rates of complications between the two groups. No further description of adverse events was provided in this study. The authors also reported that subjects who received chiropractic therapy had a longer mean length of hospital stay (4.52, 95 percent CI: 3.78, 5.36) and lower cost of treatment compared to subjects who did not receive such therapy (3.40, 95 percent CI: 2.87, 4.03), the between-group difference being statistically significant (p < 0.01). In a small prospective cohort study of 68 chronic LBP patients, 393 treatment with medication- assisted manipulation or spinal manipulation alone for at least 4 - 6 weeks resulted in no complications. In this study spinal manipulation had been delivered by two chiropractors. In addition to the intervention treatment, participants received advice for exercise. Spinal Manipulation for Treatment of Neck Pain In a nested case-control study,394 patients under the age of 60 years with cervical arterial dissection and ischemic stroke or TIA were followed-up (1995-2000) matched to controls (by sex and within age strata). This study showed that SMT was independently associated with a greater risk of vertebral arterial dissection, even after controlling for neck pain. In this study, patients with arterial dissection (n = 51) compared to controls (n = 100) were more likely to have had SMT within 30 days (14.0 percent versus 3.0 percent, p = 0.032). In multivariate analysis, 193 SMT within 30 days was associated with a significantly greater risk of vertebral artery dissection (OR = 6.6, 95 percent CI: 1.4 to 30.0). In another case-control study conducted in Canada and involving 582 cases each matched with four age and sex controls, cases were five times more likely than controls to have visited a chiropractor in the week before a vertebro-basilar accident (OR= 5.03, 95 percent CI: 1.3, 43.8). These patients were also five times more likely to have had \u0095 three visits to a chiropractic care in the month before the vertebro-basilar accident (OR= 4.98, 95 percent CI: 1.3, 18.6). These associations were observed only for patients aged 45 years or younger. 6 In a recently published case control study,395 818 cases with and 3164 matched controls without vertebro-basilar artery (VBA) stroke were compared with respect to having received chiropractic treatment. A chiropractic visit in the month before the index date was associated with an increased risk of VBA stroke in those under 45 years of age (OR=3.13, 95 percent CI: 1.48, 6.63). Similarly, increased risk was found for patients visiting a primary care physician in the month before the index date for patients under 45 years of age (OR= 3.57, 95 percent CI: 2.17, 5.86) and patients over 45 years of age (OR= 2.67, 95 percent CI: 2.25, 3.17). 194 Chapter 4. Discussion Overview This evidence report summarized, critically appraised, and compared the evidence on clinical benefits, costs, and harms associated with use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and other therapies for the treatment of adults with low back, neck, and thoracic pain. In this report, results from 364 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and six nonrandomized (one experimental and five observational) studies are summarized and reviewed. In general, the overall strength of the evidence was graded as low to moderate and the majority of it pertained to chronic nonspecific low back pain. Reporting qua lity across the trials, especially for harms was poor and inconsistent. The study results were often inconsistent probably due to substantial methodological (e.g., length of followup, blinding, design) and/or clinical (e.g., populations, treatments, and outcomes) diversity which limited the extent of comparability, interpretability, and pooling of the data. The therapy provider's experience, training, and approaches (e.g., deep or superficial massage, choice of trigger points, needling techniques) which differed across the trials may have additionally contributed to disparate results. Only a few studies measured outcomes at long-term post-treatment followup. Acupuncture Major Findings - Low Back Pain x For chronic nonspecific back pain, there was moderate grade evidence that acupuncture was better than sham acupuncture in reducing pain intensity, but only immediately after the end of treatment. The degree of clinical importance for the pooled differences in pain intensity observed between acupuncture and placebo was judged as small. Acupuncture did not differ from placebo in improving post-treatment well-being, disability, use of medication, sick leave, and global improvement (grade: low to moderate). x Acupuncture was significantly better than no treatment or usual care in reducing immediate- or short-term low back pain intensity, disability, and function (grade: moderate). The ROM and well-being were significantly better after acupuncture versus no treatment (grade: moderate). The clinical importance for the pooled differences in pain intensity observed between acupuncture and no treatment was judged as of medium degree. x The long-term post-treatment disability and utilization of conventional healthcare did not differ between subjects with low back pain receiving acupuncture and usual care (grade: low). x Acupuncture did not differ from pain medication but was better than physical therapy in reducing immediate-term post-treatment low back pain or disability (grade: low). x Manipulation was significantly more effective than acupuncture in reducing immediate post-treatment low back pain intensity (grade: low). The pooled differences observed in pain intensity between acupuncture and manipulation was of significant clinical importance. 195 Major Findings - Neck Pain x There was insufficient evidence regarding benefits of acupuncture compared to no treatment in subjects with neck pain. x For subjects with chronic neck pain, acupuncture was not different from sham-acupuncture, pain medication, mobilization/traction, or laser therapy in reducing pain or disability after the treatment (grade: low). x Manipulation was significantly better than acupuncture in reducing immediate or short-term post-treatment pain intensity or disability (grade: low). General Issues and Harms The results suggest that acupuncture might be an option for the treatment of acute, subacute, and chronic LBP (specific or nonspecific cause). For chronic nonspecific back pain there is evidence that real acupuncture is no better than sham acupuncture, but better than no treatment or usual care. The benefit of acupuncture was mostly evident immediately or shortly after the end of the treatment and then faded with time. The evidence base for acute, subacute, and mixed duration specific LBP was very sparse and less conclusive. Trials that applied sham-acupuncture tended to produce negative results (i.e., statistically nonsignificant) compared to trials that applied other types of placebo (e.g., TENS, medication, laser) between acupuncture and placebo groups. These findings agree with others indicating, that indeed, different types of controls used in acupuncture trials may result in different effects. 3,396 The reasons for inconsistent results observed in acupuncture placebo-controlled trials are not readily explained. One explanation is the beneficial effect of sham-acupuncture which rests on the diffuse noxious inhibitory control (DNIC), where neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord are strongly inhibited by the application of a nociceptive stimulus to any part of the body distinct from their excitatory receptive fields. 397 Another explanation could be the nonspecific effects of attention and beliefs in a potentially beneficial treatment. The next explanation is that the risk of bias of individual trials may have an influence on the treatment effect. The sensitivity analysis results of this review did not suggest that the pooled effect of acupuncture (compared to placebo) with respect to back pain intensity was strongly influenced by the risk of bias of the trials. Since only few trials reported any information on harms, it is difficult to adequately compare the event rates across the treatment arms. Consistency With Other Systematic Reviews The evidence base of acupuncture for low-back pain has grown in the last decade. The first Cochrane review on this topic was published in 1999 and included only eleven RCTs.398 The next update was published in 2005 and included 35 RCTs.3 The present report includes 105 RCTs of acupuncture for low back pain and has a wider scope than the previous Cochrane review since additionally, it includes studies in subjects with specific causes of low back pain. A recently published systematic review of acupuncture for low-back pain (23 trials) showed similar results to the present report. 399 The authors concluded that there was strong evidence that 196 acupuncture is no different from sham acupuncture, basing their conclusion on three trials with low risk of bias that showed no difference 22,37,141 and one trial with high risk of bias that showed acupuncture being superior over sham acupuncture.207 We based our conclusion on 12 placebo- controlled trials in low back pain. There is still a lot of uncertainty regarding the physiological effects of the needles. 22,27,37,37,99,141,156,197,198,203,206,228 One explanation for the beneficial effects of sham acupuncture is the diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC) where neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord are strongly inhibited when a nociceptive stimulus is applied to any part of the body, distinct from their excitatory receptive fields. 400 Another explanation could be the nonspecific effects of attention and beliefs in a potentially beneficial treatment. We identified three systematic reviews for neck pain.401-403 In the most recently published review completed by the Neck Pain Task Force,402 only ten studies judged to have adequate internal validity were included and assessed. The authors concluded that acupuncture was likely helpful for neck pain not associated with whiplash associated disorders. 402 Another review by Fu and colleagues401 included only RCTs with neck pain for at least 1 month, using traditional or electro-acupuncture. They excluded trials in subjects with multiple pain sites, with neck pain not being the main symptom, where only different forms of acupuncture were being compared or if neck pain was not the primary outcome. Based on 14 trials, they found that acupuncture was more effective than placebo or sham acupuncture in the treatment of neck pain for short-term pain reduction. In the third review, 403 ten trials of subjects with chronic neck pain were included. They concluded that there was moderate evidence that acupuncture was more effective for pain relief than some types of sham controls, measured immediately post-treatment; there was limited evidence that acupuncture was more effective than massage at short-term followup; for chronic neck disorders with radicular symptoms, there was moderate evidence that acupuncture was more effective than a wait-list control at short-term followup. Although the present review includes a much wider range of trials, it does find similar results to these reviews. Clinical Relevance Furlan et al., showed that improvement in acute LBP with acupuncture was on average 52.0 percent of the VAS (minimum 25.0 percent and maximum 80.0 percent) while improvement for chronic LBP was on average 32.0 percent of the VAS (min -17 percent and max - 62 percent). For people with chronic LBP receiving no treatment, the average improvement was 6.0 percent, and for sham acupuncture it was 23.0 percent (minimum -19.0 percent and maximum 44.0 percent). 3 Thus, acupuncture may be beneficial to those suffering from both acute and chronic low back pain. However, how beneficial acupuncture is when compared to standard medical care is not known. 197 Manipulation/Mobilization Major Findings - Low Back Pain - Manipulation x In subjects with nonspecific low back pain, manipulation was significantly better than placebo (grade: moderate) or no treatment (grade: low) in reducing pain intensity, but not disability, pain medication intake or ROM immediately or short-term after the treatment. x Manipulation did not differ from pain medication in improving pain intensity (grade: low). Results for pain intensity or disability were inconsistent regarding manipulation compared to massage or physiotherapy (grade: low) Major Findings - Low Back Pain - Mobilization x In subjects with acute/subacute or chronic low back pain, mobilization was significantly better than no treatment in improving pain intensity and lumbar flexibility immediately and short-term after the treatment (grade: low). x Mobilization was similar to placebo in reducing specific acute/subacute or nonspecific mixed duration pain or ROM immediately and short term post-treatment (grade: low). x Mobilization was similar to physiotherapy (a combination of manual treatment and physical modality but not physical modalities alone) in improving ROM for nonspecific chronic or mixed duration pain immediately and short term post-treatment (grade: low). x Mobilization was better than physiotherapy (a combination of manual treatment and physical modality but not physical modalities alone) in reducing immediate-term post-treatment pain intensity (grade: low). The differences observed in pooled pain intensity between mobilization and physiotherapy was not of significant clinical importance. Major Findings - Neck Pain - Manipulation x Subjects with neck pain benefited more with manipulation than placebo in terms of pain (grade: moderate), disability (grade; low), and neck flexibility (grade; low). Major Findings - Neck Pain - Mobilization x In subjects with neck pain (chronic, mixed duration), mobilization was better than no treatment in reducing pain intensity (grade: low), but not in reducing the intake of pain medication pills or the number of sick leave days immediately or short-term after the treatment (grade: low). x Mobilization was more effective than placebo in improving acute/subacute neck pain but not in improving chronic neck pain (grade: low). Mobilization was better than physiotherapy or massage in reducing pain intensity and disability in subjects with chronic nonspecific neck pain at intermediate-term after the treatment (grade: low). 198 General Issues and Harms In general, manipulation was shown to be more effective than placebo or no treatment in reducing pain intensity in subjects with back or neck pain. The benefits of manipulation appeared to be mostly limited to a period immediately or in the short-term (2 weeks to 6 months) following the treatment. Results regarding the comparison of manipulation to other treatments (e.g., pain medication, massage, or physiotherapy) in pain reduction were less consistent. The reviewed evidence indicated that mobilization for back or neck pain as associated with greater reductions in pain intensity compared with no treatment. However, the evidence regarding the comparison of mobilization to placebo was less consistent across subjects with low back and neck pain. Mobilization was better than placebo in reducing pain intensity amongst subjects with acute or subacute neck pain, but not amongst those with chronic neck pain. Some evidence indicated that subjects with low back or neck pain benefited from mobilization more than from physiotherapy in improving pain intensity. There are various methods and techniques of spinal manipulation and mobilization as well skill levels of manual practitioners. In this review, there were several trials of manipulation and mobilization comparing various methods or techniques. However, due to conflicting results, clinical heterogeneity, and low methodological quality (high risk of bias) across the trials, we were unable to determine which method or technique of manipulation or mobilization is more effective and whether the skill level of the practitioners influenced the outcome. The lack of long term benefits for spinal manipulation/mobilization is not surprising given the recurrent nature of non specific LBP. 279,309 It is uncertain whether manipulation/mobilization received during recurrent episodes (as in clinical practice) rather than during a single episode or period would result in long-term benefit including reduced frequency of recurrences. Low back pain is one of the most common and expensive disorders in developed countries. There is a high variation in the care provided for low back pain, and the optimal approach remains still unknown. 278,404 Spinal manipulation and mobilization are common treatments for low back pain, particularly among chiropractors and low back pain is the most common complaint seen by chiropractors. 405 One third of all patients who seek care for low back pain, see chiropractors,406 and over 90 percent of chiropractors use spinal manipulation when treating patients.407 Physiotherapists and osteopaths also use manipulation and mobilization for the treatment of low back pain, but the evidence on the frequency of their use is limited. For physiotherapists, the use of high velocity low amplitude manipulation in patients with acute low back pain varies from 4.0 percent 408 to 2.0 percent409 and the use of mobilization is up to 40.0 percent. Previous research has shown that 25.0 percent-40.0 percent of patients with low back pain referred to physiotherapy were positively identified as likely to benefit from spinal manipulation based on a clinical prediction rules. 306 There is a great diversity in the outcome measures used for pain (18 methods or instruments), function/disability (nine methods), global perceived effect (four methods), patient satisfaction (three methods) and quality of life (five methods) . 410 The Cochrane Collaboration Back Group has published guidelines recommending key outcome measurement categories and related minimal clinically important difference or minimal detectable change. 14 The psychometric properties and usefulness of key condition-sp ecific disability measures are important to adequately interpret findings. For example, the Neck Disability Index has been recently reviewed 199 for establishing clinically meaningful change.411 Although this is one of the most commonly used instruments for neck pain, the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) was shown to be vary across different studies and disorder types ranging from 5/50 to 19/50. There is some evidence that individualized questionnaires like the Patient Specific Disability added to standardized self-report disability measures may enhance our ability to capture change in clinical trials. Future trials may wish to incorporate such instruments as well as specify the rationale for the MCID. Only few trials evaluating mobilization and/or manipulation provided any information on the absence or presence of harms. The adverse events were not collected in a systematic manner and were poorly reported. Transient increase in low back pain was among the most common adverse events. Moreover, the findings of three case-control studies 6,394,395 suggested that younger adults (\u0095 45 years) receiving spinal manipulation were at a higher risk of having vertebral artery dissection or vertebrobasilar vascular accident. However, according to a more recent study,395 this risk was similar to that related to the visiting a primary care physician for treatment of neck pain. Higher level of evidence from RCTs will help to draw more definitive conclusions regarding the risk of vascular events following manual therapies for neck pain. Previous studies suggested that manual therapy including spinal manipulation or mobilization for low back pain is rarely associated with serious adverse events. 412,413 A number of investigators have made attempts to estimate the risk for serious adverse events in patients with neck pain receiving manipulation therapy, ranging from one in several million,414 to one in 100,000415 but these estimations were limited by numerous methodological flaws and challenges. The evidence for serious or catastrophic events is found only in case reports and retrospective case series or surveys from neurologists. 416-418 The inherent bias of retrospective reports is the over-reporting of serious adverse events compared to minor and moderate events. While the calculation of risk for the occurrence of catastrophic events such as stroke or death from cervical manipulation is supported by temporal and biologic plausibility arguments, it is plagued by numerous biases such as measurement or selection bias. The risk for catastrophic events in RCTs could not be estimated. Long term cohort trials and the establishment of mandatory national reporting registries by manipulation therapy practitioners, physicians and neurologists can address this safety issue in CAM treatments. Currently, a paucity of reports of adverse events related to mobilization techniques exists and this needs to be corrected. The lack of accurate incidence rates for adverse events may be attributed to numerous methodological challenges. The most common problems were: a) the lack of consensus on standardized definitions of adverse events, b) inadequate followup (the followup duration should be long enough to detect adverse events, be able to examine the persistence of benefits, and to assess the sustainability of the intervention), c) short-term followup can exaggerate benefits by overlooking any adverse events which may emerge more slowly. The problem is also impeded when typical symptoms evaluated for benefit are also considered as adverse events. For example, pain relief is a desired outcome of benefit, but if pain increases (short term) as a results of a manual therapy intervention, it is not always clear if this is an adverse event (unintended) or the lack of efficacy of the treatment. Adverse events may depend on accumulated dose or time. A framework for defining adverse events specific to manual therapy has been proposed 419 but it falls short of providing standardized definitions with regards to severity and thresholds for adversity of common symptoms . 200 Consistency With Other Systematic Reviews The findings in this review are not divergent from previous reviews. For example, Assendelft et al.,420 conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 39 RCTs evaluating manipulation and/or mobilization for patients with acute/subacute or chronic low back pain. This review combined manipulation and mobilization trials and excluded studies that did not assess clinically relevant outcomes such as pain, global improvement or functional status. The authors concluded that spinal manipulation (or mobilization) was more effective (both statistically and clinically important differences were found) than sham therapy or ineffective treatments and equally effective when compared to other effective treatments such as general practitioner care, physiotherapy, exercise or back school. These results were consistent regardless of symptom duration or the presence of back-related leg pain. 420 The benefits were found in the short-term for acute low back pain and in the short and long-term for chronic low back pain. The results did not differ when only trials of spinal manipulation alone were included in the analysis. Bronfort et al., 421 conducted a systematic review on the efficacy of manipulation or mobilization for low back pain and found moderate evidence that manipulation provided more short-term pain relief than mobilization and detu ned diathermy, and limited evidence on faster recovery than the commonly used physical therapy treatment. For chronic low back pain, this review found moderate evidence that manipulation had an effect similar to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Manipulation/mobilization was effective in the short term when compared with placebo and general practitioner care, and in the long term compared to physical therapy. There was moderate evidence that manipulation was better than physical therapy and home back exercise in both the short- and long-term. In patients with a mix of acute and chronic low back pain, this review found that manipulation/mobilization provided either similar or better pain outcomes in the short and long term compared with placebo, McKenzie therapy, medical care, management by physical therapists, soft tissue treatment or back school. The findings of this review regarding neck pain are consistent with those of other reviews. 422\u00ad 426 While some differences can be explained by the inclusion criteria and grading of trials between this and other two reviews,422,423 the major results in general are similar. Two additional systematic reviews 427,428 assessed multimodal interventions that included mobilization and manipulation combined with other interventions. The trials included in these reviews were outside the scope of this review. Clinical Relevance It is uncertain what is the optimal frequency and duration of manipulation/mobilization therapy for nonspecific low back pain. In clinical practice, frequency and duration of treatment are usually tailored to the individual needs of the patient. In this review, adult patients classified as having nonspecific low back pain were assumed to be homogeneous in terms of the disease. However, some evidence suggests that there are subgroups of nonspecific LBP patients who are likely to respond differently to various types of intervention. 429,430 A clinical prediction rule with five variables (symptom duration, fear-avoidance beliefs, lumbar hypomobility, hip internal rotation range of motion, and no symptoms distal to the knee), has been recently developed and validated application of which can increase the probability of success with manipulation from 45 201 percent to 95 percent for subjects with nonspecific low back pain.31,431 In clinical practice, only some patients with nonspecific low back pain may receive manipulation depending on the clinical presentation. In our review the intervention was restricted to manipulation alone, mobilization alone, or combination of manipulation and mobilization. This was done to adequately evaluate these specific interventions. However, this may not reflect the realities of clinical practice, where multi-modal approaches are the norm. Combining various forms of manipulation, mobilization, education and exercise that is individualized to the patient is supported from a theoretical and clinical reasoning perspective. Trials that included multi-modal treatment were excluded from this review, and therefore our findings may not be readily applicable to multimodal treatments used in practice including manipulation or mobilization. This review attempted to answer the question of efficacy: \"Can manipulation or mobilization positively affect neck pain?\" The included st udies may not reflect typical practice in the community of manual therapy. For example, single session or low dose trials with immediate post-treatment followup tend to give positive findings and exaggerate the treatment benefit. There were some trials in this review that were pragmatic and were designed to answer how well manipulation works in practice. 51,140,307,318,320,321,330,332 These trials tended to have larger samples, a longer duration or higher dose of treatment, enroll more heterogeneous populations, and allow the manual therapy interventions to vary as they would in clinical practice. These effectiveness trials are designed to give a broader clinical applicability. Their findings were more conservative and varied relative to the less pragmatic trials. Massage Major Findings - Low Back Pain x Massage was superior to placebo or no treatment (grade: low) in reducing pain (grade: moderate) and disability (grade: low) immediately post-treatment only in subjects with acute/subacute but not in subjects with chronic low back pain (grade: low). x Massage was significantly better than relaxation (clinical importance of difference: medium degree) or physical therapy (clinical importance of difference: large degree) in reducing chronic nonspecific low back pain intensity but not ROM, immediately after the treatment (grade: low to moderate). Major Findings - Neck Pain x Massage was better than no treatment in reducing immediate-term post-treatment pain intensity in subjects with chronic or unknown duration of nonspecific pain (grade: low). x Massage was better than placebo in reducing neck pain intensity immediately after the treatment in subjects with acute/subacute or unknown duration of nonspecific pain 202 (grade: low). Massage was not different from placebo in improving well-being or ROM in subjects with chronic pain (grade: low). General Issues and Harms When the outcomes of pain and function are examined, it seems that massage had a more consistent impact in pain intensity than on function or ROM for which many trials had conflicting findings. This might be due to psychological factors that contribute to disability which are not addressed by massage therapy. Typically, massage therapy is delivered differently in many different parts of the world. The variations in practice settings, study populations, severity of the disorder, duration and number of massage sessions, types of placebo (e.g., TENS, massage) and adjuvant modalities might all contribute to different results. In the reviewed trials, practice settings as well as inclusion and exclusion criteria for study populations were often poorly specified. One bias inherent in all trials was that blinding of the patient, care provider, and often outcome assessor was often not achieved and may have led to exaggerated treatment effect estimates. Blinding of the therapist is not possible, therefore, effort is needed to blind the outcome assessor. In most of the reviewed studies, the primary outcome was a \"self-reported\" outcome such as pain, global perceived effect, disability/function or quality of life, in other words a \"subjective\" outcome type. Bias may be introduced when blinding of patients and care giver is inadequate. Furthermore, massage trials often used primary outcomes such as single-item pain scales. For such trials, the patient automatically becomes the \"outcome assessor\" and therefore cannot be blinded. For other multi-item self report tools, such as the Neck Disability Index, the patient may be na\u00efve, may have lower recall of their original rating and may not always be considered to be the \"outcome assessor\". Outcomes utilizing performance based findings are needed to balance the inherent bias in reporting self-reported outcome measures. Information on harms reported in the massage trials was very limited. No serious adverse events were reported. In a few trials, subjects receiving massage experienced transient back/neck soreness. Consistency With Other Systematic Reviews A Cochrane Review of massage for nonspecific low-back pain, updated in 2008, included 13 RCTs.432 All 13 studies were also included in this review. The present review included four more trials. Two of these trials were published after the Cochrane review,93,368 and two trials in subjects with disc herniation were excluded from the Cochrane review because of the population eligibility criterion. 159,362 The Cochrane review concluded that \"massage was superior for pain and function compared with placebo or no treatment on both short and long-term followups. Massage was similar to exercise, and it was superior to joint mobilization, relaxation therapy, physical therapy, acupuncture, and self-care education. In two reviews of neck pain, 433,434 limited implications for clinical practice were noted. No recommendations could be made due to unclear evidence and the difficulty in comparing very different massage forms. Four different massage therapy approaches, all in trials of very low quality (high risk of bias) and of moderate clinical applicability showed evidence of no benefit in pain relief when compared to different forms of control treatment. The trials within these two 203 reviews included ischemic compression, the use of a J-cane tool, Western massage, and occipital release for typically subacute or chronic neck pain. Clinical Relevance The application of the massage techniques can be very different in research trials relative to how it is applied in clinical practice. A standardized taxonomy is needed for massage and although one has been suggested, 435 there is no movement to adopt it within the research community. Cost-Effectiveness of CAM Therapies There was consistent evidence for the cost-effectiveness of acupuncture for back and neck pain relative to usual care or no treatment, but this was based on only three studies. Because the benefits of spinal manipulation were modest or absent in the six trials of spinal manipulation that included economic analyses, there is no compelling evidence for the cost-effectiveness of this treatment for back or neck pain. The only trial that included massage as a treatment found massage more costly and less effective than usual physician care. In summary, because of the small number of economic evaluations, the inconsistent standards of comparison, and the substantial heterogeneity among these studies (different countries with different health care payment systems), it is not possible to reach clear conclusions about the cost-effectiveness of any of these CAM treatments for back or neck pain or to make global application of the findings. These initial studies suggest that spinal manipulation may not be cost-effective and acupuncture is promising. There have not yet been any economic evaluations of a defined massage treatment protocol for back or neck pain. Strengths and Limitations of Review Strengths This review identified a large amount of evidence on efficacy and safety of CAM treatments used in the management of back and neck pain. The reviewers used systematic, comprehensive, and independent strategies to minimize the risk of bias in searching, identifying, retrieving, screening, abstracting, and appraising the primary studies. The search strategy, which was not restricted by the language or year of publication, was applied to multiple electronic sources. Furthermore, the references of included studies were hand-searched for potentially eligible reports. Further strength of this review is that results of individual trials regarding primary outcomes were stratified and subgrouped by spine region (e.g., low back, neck), duration of pain (acute, subacute, chronic, mixed, and unknown), and cause of pain (specific or nonspecific). The reviewers were able to pool results of individual trials in series of meta-analyses for all reviewed major treatments (acupuncture, manipulation, mobilization, and massage) within subgroups of populations defined by spine region (low back, neck), duration of pain (acute, subacute, chronic, mixed, and unknown), and length of post-treatment followup for each outcome (immediate, short-term, intermediate-term, and long-term). The reviewers assessed and reported the degree 204 of clinical importance of the observed statistically significant pooled differences in pain intensity between the treatment groups. This review assessed the extent of publication bias using a visual inspection of the funnel plot and the Egger's regression-based technique.16 Although the visual inspection method is not very reliable, it conveys some general idea as to how symmetrical the dispersion of individual trial effect estimates is around more precise effect. 8 Note that methodological and clinical heterogeneity across trials may also contribute to funnel plot asymmetry.15 The funnel plot of acupuncture placebo-controlled trials showed some degree of asymmetry which may have arisen due to publication bias. Publication bias, if present, may have led to overestimation of the treatment effect of acupuncture compared to placebo in reducing pain intensity. We aimed to minimize publication bias by supplementing the comprehensive search strategy with inclusion of grey literature and reports published in non-English journals. The collected data allowed us to perform a sensitivity analysis which explored the influence of study quality (i.e., risk-of-bias) on the pooled treatment effect (reduction of pain intensity) in trials comparing acupuncture to placebo. Limitations This review is limited by the information provided in the included primary studies. Most of these studies were of high risk of bias. Many trials had small sample size (e.g. pilot, feasibility studies) or used a single treatment session and may have had limited power to detect clinically meaningful differences in the primary outcomes between the study treatment groups. A high proportion of acupuncture trials published in Chinese did not explicitly define the primary binary outcome 'curative effect,' the definition of which may have varied across these trials. Study reports did not always provide sufficient quantitative information (e.g., standard deviations, standard errors, mean endpoints) necessary for pooling the results of individual trials. Authors of many trials failed to report statistical test results for between-group differences in outcome measures after the end of treatment. The occurrence of harms was not reported in the majority of trials, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions regarding absolute or relative safety of the reviewed treatments. The risk-of-bias graphs indicated that the adequacy of methods for randomization was not clear for at least 40 percent of all trials. It was no t clear whether or not the treatment allocation was concealed for more than half of all trials. Study participants' blinding status was reported more frequently compared to assessors' blinding status. The baseline distribution of subjects' characteristics and study participants' blinding status were better reported than methods of randomization or treatment of allocation. The overall proportion of double blind trials amongst the trials reporting this information was very low (about 10.0 percent). It should be noted that in most situations where physical treatments are applied, effective blinding is very difficult or impossible to achieve. The absence of data for the above-mentioned domains (i.e., randomization methods, treatment allocation concealment, blinding status) limits the extent of valid interpretation of the review results. There was substantial clinical (e.g., populations, treatments, and outcomes) and methodological (e.g., length of followup, blinding, design) heterogeneity present across included trials which may have led to the disparate results. For example, there were many different treatment modalities used within acupuncture (e.g., dry needling, conventional needling, 205 warming needle, electro-acupuncture, trigger-point acupuncture, laser-acupuncture), spinal manipulation therapy (e.g., manual manipulation, instrument-assisted manipulation), flexion-distraction technique, osteopathy, mobilization, traditional bone-setting techniques, and massage (e.g., acupressure, reflexology) or their combinations with other therapies (e.g., pain medications, physiotherapy, traction, exercise, standard therapy, advice/education) making it very difficult to meaningfully compare and summarize the efficacy and safety parameters of the review. Moreover, the therapy provider's experience, training, and approaches (e.g., deep or superficial massage, choice of trigger points, needling techniques) which differed across the trials may have additionally impacted the trial results. The observed variability in the experimental interventions was compounded by a wide variety of control (comparison) treatments used across the trials (e.g., physiotherapy, exercise, advice/book, standard therapy, other CAM therapy, placebo, no treatment). For example, some trials used different types of placebo (detuned short-wave diathermy, superficial needling, TENS placebo, sham manipulation, sham acupuncture, sham massage) whose effects may have been different, thereby contributing additional heterogeneity. The above-mentioned clinical diversity limited the extent of statistical pooling of trial results. Some of the pooled analyses revealed unexplained statistical heterogeneity. Therefore, the results of such meta-analyses should be viewed with caution. Quantitative subgroup analyses exploring the effects of age, gender, race, type of treatment provider, or dose of treatment could not be performed due to lack or insufficient data. For example, the largest meta-analysis in this review included only 10 trials and the remaining smaller meta-analyses included a range of two to four trials. None of the pooled trials included solely subjects from these subgroups of interest. Similarly, the results from several trials that were conducted in subjects of specific age- or gender-based subgroups (e.g., elderly, young adults, men, and women) were not comparable due to different control treatments used, duration of pain, and/or cause of pain in subjects included in these trials. One more limitation of this review may be the use of a nonweighted system for averaging risk of bias (i.e. high, medium, low) for multiple studies for grading overall strength of evidence. This review focused on manipulation or mobilization to estimate the efficacy. Results from these studies may not be readily applicable to various combinations of interventions used in today's practice. However, the assessment of a single intervention is the first step in teasing out which therapeutic item is more effective in reducing pain and improving function. Future Research Stronger efforts are needed to improve the quality of conduct and reporting of primary studies evaluating CAM therapies. The primary study authors should consider CONSORT statement as a reporting guide in order to improve the quality of reporting. 436 For example, authors of future trials should direct more attention to minimizing bias (e.g., randomization sequence generation, treatment allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, and selective outcome reporting) in conducting, analyzing, and reporting results of primary trials. Some factors that may influence results of clinical trials assessing patient-reported outcomes for manipulative treatments were discussed by Licciardone et al., 437 who listed the following sources of bias: a) attrition or selection bias (e.g., differential dropout or withdrawal rates, self-selection bias), b) investigator bias (e.g., allocation concealment), and c) nonspecific treatment 206 effects due to investigator-subject relationship, regression to the mean, and subjects' expectation of outcomes/treatment credibility due to awareness of the treatment they are assigned to receive. Moreover, trial authors need to characterize and report frequency (e.g., number of sessions per unit of time) and duration of treatments used, in order to help establish which of these characteristics make these therapies most optimal in terms of benefits and harms. Trial investigators need to consider the use of validated instruments for measuring outcomes. Currently, there is a great diversity in outcome measures used for pain, function/disability, global perceived effect, patient satisfaction and quality of life. The Cochrane Collaboration Back Group has published guidelines recommending key outcome measurement categories and related minimal clinically important difference or minimal detectable change. 14 For efficiency purposes, a single trial should ideally measure maximum number of relevant outcomes (pain, function, return to work, and health care utilization). To minimize the risk of bias inherent to some subjective outcome measures (e.g., pain, disability, quality of life, GPE, patient satisfaction), investigators should additionally measure and report objective outcomes (e.g., performance-based outcomes, impairment measures, range of motion, muscle strength). Since in most studies of low back and neck pain, the primary outcome is self-reported pain, global perceived effect, disability/function or quality of life, the lack of blinding or inadequate blinding of study subjects or outcome assessors may bias the trial results. Therefore, it is important that more efforts be directed towards better blinding methodologies applied in future trials. For a given trial, it is important to consider an appropriate placebo treatment. For example, in this review, trials that applied sham-acupuncture or sham-manipulation tended to have negative results compared to trials that applied other types of placebo (e.g., no treatment, laser-placebo, TENS-placebo). Future head-to-head trials comparing CAM treatments should ideally have a large sample size, since in case of small trials, it is difficult to explain whether the negative results are due to true equivalence between the interventions or due to small samples. Factorial design including randomization first to CAM therapy or no treatment, and then randomizing to other treatment modalities would be most informative to delineate the additive/subtractive and individual effects of CAM therapies relative to any given treatment. Future trials should help to better inform the influence of treatment-, care-provider (e.g. experience, skills), and population-specific factors on treatment effect estimates. It is desirable that treatment providers (chiropractors, acupuncturists, massage therapists) employed in future trials be highly experienced. More research should be conducted elucidating clinical benefits of different forms of CAM therapies relative to each other, since at present there is no clear advantage of any particular type. It is also important to collect and report information on patients' previous experience, beliefs, and their expectations of CAM therapies to assess the impact of these factors on the success of care. More data from well-conducted trials are needed for definitive conclusions regarding the relationships between the use of CAM and conventional therapies in subjects with neck and back pain. Finally, the exploration and explanation of key causal or biological mechanisms underlying the effects of CAM therapies and their variation across subgroups of patients are also warranted. 207 References and Included Studies 1.

Yes / No Have all the important adverse events that may be a consequence of the intervention been reported? Yes / No Have the characteristics of patients lost to follow-ups been described? Yes / No Have actual probability values been reported (e.g. 0.035 rather than <0.05) for the main outcomes except where the probability value is less than 0.001? Yes / No External validity F - 8 Were the subjects asked to participate in the study representative of the entire population from which they were recruited? Yes / No / Unable to determine Were those subjects who were prepared to participate representative of the entire population from which they were recruited? Yes / No / Unable to determine Were the staff, places and f acilities where the patients were treated, representative of the treatment the majority of patients receive? Yes / No / Unable to determine Internal validity - bias Was an attempt made to blind study subjects to the intervention they have received? Yes / No / Unable to determine Was an attempt made to blind those measuring the main outcomes of the intervention? Yes / No / Unable to determine If any of the results of the study were based on \"data dredging\", was this made clear? Yes / No / Unable to determine In trials and cohort studies, do the analyses adjust for different lengths of follow-up of patients, or in case- control studies, is the time period between intervention and outcome the same for cases and control? Yes / No / Unable to determine Were the statistical tests used to assess the main outcomes appropriate? Yes / No / Unable to determine Was compliance with the intervention/s reliable? Yes / No / Unable to determine Were the main outcome measures used accurate (valid and reliable)?

Yes / No / Unable to determine Were study subjects in different intervention groups (trials and cohort studies) or were the cases and controls (case-control studies) recruited over the same period of time? Yes / No / Unable to determine Were study subjects randomized to intervention groups? Yes / No / Unable to determine Was the randomized intervention assignment concealed from both patients and health care staff until recruitment was complete and irrevocable? Yes / No / Unable to determine Was there adequate adjustment for confounding in the analyses from which the main findings were drawn? Yes / No / Unable to determine Were loses of patients to follow-up taken into account? Yes / No / Unable to determine Power Did the study have sufficient power to detect a clinically important effect where the probability value for a difference being due to chance is less than 5%?
