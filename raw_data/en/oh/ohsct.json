An herbal pharmacy is a place where Traditional Chinese Medicine [herbalists](https://www.americanacupuncturecenter.com/herbal-medicine) create herbal formulas individually tailored to each patient. Our herbal pharmacy contains single herbs in the form of granules. Granules have a fine, powdery texture that rapidly dissolves in water. They are formed by decocting raw herbs and then binding the concentrate to excipients and removing any moisture. Once dissolved in warm water, the herbal granules form an herbal tea. This method of taking herbal medicine is much more convenient than raw herbs because there are no complicated cooking instructions or long cooking time required. All of our herbal products are purchased from growers and manufacturers that provide the highest quality herbs by thoroughly testing for heavy metals, spores, and pesticide residues.
