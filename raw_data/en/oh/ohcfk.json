Along with the itch, have you noticed flaky patches on your scalp or parts of your body? This can be the result of a skin condition called seborrheic dermatitis. The exact cause of seborrheic dermatitis is not known yet. However, with natural remedies and treatments, you can keep its symptoms under control. What is seborrheic dermatitis? Seborrheic dermatitis is a common, noncontagious skin condition. It causes redness, scaly patches, and dandruff. Seborrheic dermatitis mostly affects the scalp, but it can also develop on the face, back, and upper chest. When infants develop this condition, it's known as cradle cap. The scaly patches developed on the baby's scalp can be crusty or greasy. Causes of seborrheic dermatitis? The exact cause of seborrheic dermatitis isn't known. However, two main factors can contribute to the development of the condition. 1) The first factor is the over-production of oil. An excess amount of oil can irritate the skin, causing it to become greasy and red. 2) The second contributing factor is Malassezia, a type of fungus that's naturally found in the skin's oils. Malassezia may sometimes grow abnormally; this causes the skin to secrete more oil than usual. The increase in oil production can lead to seborrheic dermatitis. If the condition is mild, natural remedies can help to clear up the patches and bring back your healthy skin.
