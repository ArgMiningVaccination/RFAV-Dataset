That's it. There's no extra work on your part, just pure relaxation. Jones deems it \"the perfect state of napping.\" After waking from a deep sleep to learn her session had finished, she left the studio feeling like she was \"on a puffy, pink cloud.\" Sounds pretty amazing, right? For an entire 30-minute session, you pay $75. The crystal bed at Modrn Sanctuary's retails around $9000 (!), so comparatively speaking, it's not overly expensive. However, if you don't live in NYC, or a crystal bed therapy session doesn't sound quite like your thing, there are other ways to get your gemstone fix.
