If you don't mind me asking .... in retrospect, would you have started the medication earlier? Your input is very helpful, as you are farther along the path than we are. Thanks again.

I'm waiting for our 1st paediatric appointment for my 6yr old and after reading about the side effects of anti-epileptics all my instincts are shouting \"Noooooo!\" I'm not well informed about all this yet but the medication side sounds like a minefield and I just don't want to go down that route. However....I might have to. I'd be interested to know your decision. I completely understand where you're coming from re not medicating.

I am not anti-medication and am grateful that it is available. However, like many, I am concerned about the side effects. We are on a very cautious \"wait and see\" approach. Her seizures will either get better, get worse, or stay the same. Like so many aspects of parenting, we are taking this \"day by day\".

I'm not anti-medication either but just so scared of the side affects that I read about & hear from other parents! It has been a year now and it has been very difficult because of the redicule that I get for not using pharmaceuticals - from parents, teachers, family and his pediatrician, which said I was bordering on medical neglect! Needless to say I'm in search of a new one. I am concerned about other kids making fun of him & my biggest concern right now is swimming! He knows how to swim and is closley supervised -of course.

Submitted by helling1111 on Wed, 2010-04-07 - 23:25 HI - our daughter is 8 years old. She has been having absence seizures for almost one year. I know that some people think we are crazy for not medicating but, for now, that is our decision. I have worked in healthcare for over 20 years and it bothers me that we are basically going against the medical advice of our pediatric neurologist. However, we have had an indepth discussion with our family doctor (who knows us very well) and he is supportive of our decision. Although he did tell us that he would chose to medicate if it was his child. I can understand that perspective. My daughter is in 2nd grade and has only told me once that she heard someone making fun of her. Of course, that crushed me, but I also know that kids will make fun of other kids for many different reasons. I also worry about swimming and wonder if there is any safety devices available for keeping kids safe?? Even if my daughter was on medication, I would still have concerns about the swimming pool and other activites. So ... not sure that helps but we can offer each other support! Take good care!

She seem worse when she is over tired, but she can still hear me talk to her, like i say they are only brief episodes, but she has quite a few a day, when tired, I try and let her get plenty of sleep. The Dr has decided to go along with me for now with not medicating, this was the most terrifying thing ive done, its just the side effects of the drugs seem to outweigh how she is at the moment, this has torn me apart and I worry all the time, we are very caring parents, but feel we would try alternatives first, hope your daughter is doing well take care Diane Hi I have a daughter who is 8 yrs, she has abscence epilepsey for 16 months now, and I too have chosen not to medicate her, they are very brief spells, and still goes about her daily tasks as normal, school have not noticed these episodes yet, and she seems to be ok on herself, my daugther swims, and I just watch at the side when it is her lesson, she starts swimming with the school in yr5, and they have said they will just take an extra teacher with them as look out, so far she has done well with swimming and passed her honours and also done her mile swim without any problems, i give her omega 3, ive heard that this can help.

Submitted by katelambo on Fri, 2010-04-09 - 17:11 Hi there I am mum to Lille, who if 5 years old. In November last year Lille was diagnosed with absence seizures. I too have chosen not to medicate and completley understand your concerns. It is a very distressing and confusing time for me (and must be for you too) and I completley understand your predicament. I dont want to change my daughter in any way by controlling her absences with medication and perhaps substitute one problem for another but neither do i wish to be preventing her from a 'normal' childhood by not doing. I find it hard to fight against the medical world who, although tolerate my wishes are concerned about my not medicating. I have changed our whole diet (we only eat homemade food from natural ingredients) removed any harmful products from our home environment (sls', parabens) and Lille also sees a homeopath and has regular cranial sacral massage. I can honestly say that her seizures (she was having about 40 a day) have reduced significantly and she now has 3 or 4 a day. Although on a bad day (when she is tired mainly) they raise significantly - (max 10 lasting about 6 seconds) and im aware that Lille is somewhat confused and daized after a seizure. It is on these days that i question my decision although i know, hand on heart how much the changes to our lifestyle have helped matters. She is currently progressing well at school although on her last parents evening her teacher commented on her tendancy to become distracted and disinterested (although without seizures, this was also a regular comment made about myself when i was a little girl!). I worry that as she is so young she cannot describe the feelings of 'disjointed-ness'and no one can really assess how her 'blips' are effecting her. It also makes me feel sad that she really doesnt know any different. I am now seeing a childhood nutritionlist who has presrcibed Lille with magnesium although i would ensure you have these prescribed rather than just trying them out. I feel that the last 4 months for me have been a journey of discovery about environment, neurology and nutrition and it is only a matter of time until i discover the final piece to the jigsaw which will rid of her seizures altogether but it is on days when i see her tired and having many absences that make me question my actions. I hope i have helped you and would love for you to get in contact if you want to discuss any of the methods i am trying or talk through your decision not to medicate with someone who is in the same boat, we are, like everyone else trying to do the very best for our precious little ones. Sending love and the warmest of wishes. Kate Hi there I am mum to Lille, who if 5 years old. In November last year Lille was diagnosed with absence seizures.

We have no genetic history and her MRI was negative for anything that would cause these seizures. She has always been a fun, loving, gifted child and very athletic. Her pediatric neuro started her on Lamictal. We are so reluctant to put her on any pharms. I know that for every good thing they do there are the negatives. I waited 3 weeks and finally decided we should try it. After 3 weeks on Lamictal her behavior started to change dramatically. She was very impatient, moody, angry and easily emotional. Like a women during PMS times 100. I decided to call and see if we could change her meds. She is now on Zonisamide. After reading that it is not approved for children under 16 I am so confused on what to do next! I read side effects that included it may retard growth in children. I too am so confused. Her seizures are more apparent when she doesn't get enough sleep or when she is stressed from school. I feel their has to be an alternative to pharms. Does anyone know of any homeopathic therapies that can help?? I am not sure what is harming her more.. the few seizures she has or the side effects of meds on a growing child?? Any suggestions??

We went to a naturopath for guidance regarding diet, environmental factors, etc. She recommended 400 iu of Vitamin E - our pediatric neurologist basically said \"it won't hurt anything\". The biggest help our naturopath provided was starting our daughter on 3 mg of Melatonin. She was taking 2 hours to fall asleep and the Melatonin has reduced that to about 30 minutes. We know that sleep is critical, so I feel good about that. Even her neuro. said \"I prescribe Melatonin all the time\". Like you, we are trying to balance the pros/cons of medications. Our doctor recommended Ethosuximide. We haven't tried it yet. Our 8 year old daughter has been having absence seizures for about 8 months.

Submitted by hnubtshiab on Wed, 2010-02-17 - 11:41 I was diagnosed with petit mal seizures when I was 16 although I had had them since I was 7-8 years old. Prior to my diagnosis my previous doctors were confused about what was wrong with me diagnosing me with everything from asthma to panic attacks (I gasp for breath and look scared/worried when I have my seizures). My doctors also told me I would likely grow out of them but I still have seizures. I was on tegretol and then trileptal for about 2-3 years and then I stopped taking my medicine against my doctor's recommendation. I was and in many ways still am in denial about my seizures. At 25, I am still having seizures although they only occur in spurts every 2-3 months. I have been off of medication for 6-7 years now. It does not seem to have interfered too much with my ability to function. I graduated from college, have been able to hold a full time job, and am now in graduate school. I am choosing to go back to see a doctor again because I am concerned that my seizures may get worse. I am also concerned about my memory. I have trouble retrieving information. I feel horrible when my husband asks me if I remember an event we shared together and I am completely blank as to what he is referring to. I am embarassed when my classmates ask me about something we discussed in class two days ago and I although I seem to remember talking about it I can't for the life of me figure out the details until they tell me. I haven't seen a doctor in years but am going back to see one next month. I don't know if my memory would have been better had I stayed on my medication. I am worried though that the lack of medication has allowed my seizures to continue and my memory has continued to decline. I have no recommendations or information to share. Only my story.

Unfortuantley they became more frequent and longer and it did effect his life. I wish we could say it helped, but he has failed 7 diffferent medications, two put him in the hospital and the rest either gave him an allergic reation (rash) or made him worse. I am curious what Homeopthic rememdies you are trying. We have tried herbs and currently avoid all Gluten and are on a version of the Modified Adkins diet, low carb hight fat.

We may have made his life worse by staving off traditional treatment. He may have killed himself if we kept him on it. We pray we pray we pray. The diet is a gem of a resource. He looks like such a healthy strapping young man and he is a good athlete with plenty of energy because he is eating such incredibly nutricious food.

Submitted by HollyInnes on Wed, 2010-12-08 - 16:18 All I can say to those who are not medicating your children with Absence Seizures that you are very fortunate that you can. I am 33 years old and have had Absence seizures since I was 4 years old. I began having only a few a day. I was told there was a good chance I would grow out of them. I hit my teens and they became worse...over 100 seizures a day. I have always been medicated...and have been on several combinations of medications trying to find something that works. Today I am on a combination of epival, topomax, and keppra. On a good day I have 5 seizures...on a bad close to 100. My life is as normal as anyone elses. I have a great job for a financial institution. I am happily married. The only restriction on my life is I can not drive. I encourage you to treat your kids like \"normal\" kids. Encourage them to do all kinds of sports and activities. But do know that teatment using meds early is probably the right thing to do. It is nice to think that the seizures will go away on their own, but you have to face reality...your child has epilepsy and you should help them the best you can by treating them. I also encourage you to talk to your doctors about the side effects of the medications. I am on three different medications at very low dosages because being on just one at a high dose had very bad side effects for me. All the best to your families.

Submitted by bec123 on Thu, 2012-03-29 - 11:01 Hi Amy, My son, like your daughter, was probably having seizures for about two years before we finally had the issue diagnosed. He has temporal lobe epilepsy (absence seizures) that took the form of a severe headache followed by 24 hours of sleep. This occurred at a gradually increasing rate from 1 episode every 6 months (age 5) to eventually 1 episode every month until we started Keppra at age 7. Inititially, we assumed that he was having migraines, but in the end realized that he was having seizures when he started staying awake during the headaches. He then displayed the typical mouth and hand movements and unresponsive state that are associated with this type of seizure. We didn't know what it was, but knew enough to call the neurologist. They scheduled an emergency appointment and an EEG confirmed temporal lobe seizures. Like you, I did not want to start him on medication and actually waited 3 more months from the date of diagnosis to start the medication. His seizures got worse, as the doctor said would most likely happen and we decided to put him on the medication. From what the doctors have told me (I consulted 4 different specialists) and from what I have read (months of reading anything i could get my hands on) having repeated seizures actually increases the likelyhood that you will continue to have them and at an increasing rate and to a worsening degree. As our current doctor eplained, it is like riding a bike. The brain \"learns\" to have the seizure and each subsequent one gives the brain more practice in having them, so to speak. The medication allows the brain to reset itself and breaks the cyclic pattern. My son has been taking Keppra at it's minimal dosage for almost 2 years now and has not had any noticible seizures. We will be attempting to take him off the medication this summer. Fingers crossed, this will be all it takes. He went through a few months of adjustment to the medication, moodiness, etc. But he has done so well that I am really happy that I took the plunge. He used to get so scared when he would have a seizure and be confused for days afterward. It effected everything. The key is to try to not freak out and keep calm so that your child can keep calm. That makes a huge difference itself. Please let me know if you need any more information. I would love to help you through this difficult and confusing time. X Rebecca By the way, my son had already been on a strict diet for years that coincided with some of the more popular approaches to diet and epilepsy simply due to the fact that he has had severe food allergies since birth. He is on and was during and before the seizures started, an ample sleep schedule with an attempt to keep environmental stressors to a minimum because it helpe with his allergy symptoms. We even moved to a dry/desert climate from our original mid west state which had a huge positive impact on his allergies, but unfortunately not on the progression of his epilepsy ( we did not expect it to, though and did not move for that reason.) Having said that, it is definitely worth making the environmental changes and even trying the various diet options out there. Nothing should be ruled out. In our case, however, the medication proved to be the best option. Hope this helps.

Submitted by WTH1963 on Tue, 2012-10-16 - 10:34 Our Daughter, like yours, was diagnosed with absence seizures (just prior to her 6th birthday). She has just turned 7 and we have been medicating her since the diagnosis. Her life is normal with the meds. She takes Levetirace each morning and evening. It is as simple as taking a \"vitamin\" at breakfast and before bed, though with an oral syringe. She has been a wonderful trooper with taking her meds and the results have been as if we had never had epilepsy. I understand that there are many that have preconceptions and concerns about medicating their children. There had been much media buzz about the general topic, though in a vast expanse of illnesses and conditions. Everyone is naturally and primarily concerned with their child's well being. Please understand that there are some conditions that are more \"controllable\" than others. In our case, and from our understanding of the absence seizures of our daughter's epilepsy, this is a controllable condition. Other than the actions of taking the meds each day, her life is happy and normal. Without the medication, the multiple daily episodes and the safety issues associated, do have a great effect on daily life and routine. I feel strong with our rationalization to follow through with the medication. Without it, there are always concerns of walking into something, dropping, spilling, hurting and a notion of needing a 24/7 \"spotter\". With seizures, her ability to play on the playground, ride a bike, or engage in other activities (including swimming) would be compromised. Missing out on the ability of the \"normal\" childhood would also be compromised. In this instance, we are fortunate that her condition has medication that provides her an option for all of us to engage in her normal upbringing and routine. Please do not discount this option. I fully understand and recognise the choices for each family. Please consider all aspects and effects of the decision and do not stand on the ceremony of a general issue. Consider whatever it takes to allow your child to have the normal lifestyle. They cannot thank you now, but they may later. Our decision was right for us and we are thankful for it. You will make the right choice for your family. Good luck and best wishes for you your family and precious daughter.
