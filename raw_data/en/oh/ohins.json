We believe in a comprehensive approach to pain free living. We find our combination of traditional medicine and holistic approaches offer the best platform for a speedy recovery. Chiropractic Chiropractors diagnose and treat disorders of the musculoskeletal and the nervous system, and the effects of these disorders on general health. Chiropractic care is frequently used to treat a wide variety of neuro musculoskeletal complaints such as back pain, neck pain, headaches and pain in the joints of the arms or legs. Doctors of Chiropractic - offer a hands-on approach to health care that includes patient examination, diagnosis, and treatment. Chiropractors have broad diagnostic skills and are also trained to recommend therapeutic and rehabilitative exercises, as well as to provide nutritional, dietary and lifestyle counseling. The foremost therapeutic procedure performed by doctors of chiropractic is known as \"spinal manipulation,\" or \"chiropractic adjustment.\" The purpose of manipulation is to restore joint mobility by applying a controlled force into joints that have become restricted in their movement. Restricted joint motion can be caused by a single traumatic event or injury, repetitive stresses, or poor posture. No matter what caused the injury, tissues undergo physical and chemical changes that can cause pain, inflammation and diminished function. Manipulation or adjustment of the affected joint and tissues restores mobility, thereby alleviating pain and muscle tightness, and allowing tissues to heal. Chiropractic care and the prescribed rehabilitation are sufficient to resolve many conditions. When other medical conditions exist, chiropractic care may complement medical treatment by relieving the musculoskeletal aspects associated with the condition. Physical Medicine Modalities and Therapeutic Procedures Physical Medicine Modalities and Therapeutic Procedures are a form of \"hands-on\" manual therapy used to aid in a rapid recovery and rehabilitation from all forms of injury, sports related or otherwise. In addition, Physical Therapy Modalities and Therapeutic Procedures can be used to maintain your body in its optimum state, which can enhance your performance during sport and also aid in reducing the chances of future injuries. Physical Medicine Modalities and Therapeutic Procedures treatment is usually quite gentle and is very safe. Techniques commonly used by therapists are: joint mobilizations, soft tissue massage, trigger point therapy, ultrasound, electrical stimulation, combined with home based stretching and strengthening exercises.

This allows the body to not only benefit from an increased range of motion and decrease in pain but also from a reduction in muscle spasm and trigger points. Personal Injury At Hansen Chiropractic, we understand the bio-mechanical relationships that result in pain and discomfort following injuries related to automobile accidents. Whiplash is one of the most common injuries patients experience. Did you know that many whiplash injuries can also result in trauma to the lower back? In addition to agonizing pain, whiplash-type injuries may also result in torn muscles, stretched tendons, inflamed joints, internal bruising, and bleeding. The most common auto injury is whiplash, which is caused by a sudden movement of the head. The result is that muscles and ligaments supporting the spine can become strained or torn. Some symptoms may include neck pain or stiffness, pain between the shoulder blades, blurred vision, fatigue, headache and dizziness to name a few. Just as it is important to get rid of pain following an accident, it is important to correct bio-mechanical injuries and restore normal ranges of motion. At Hansen Chiropractic we have successfully treated hundreds of auto accidents and work injuries. We have definitely learned the importance of care following an accident. "}
