In March 2014, the V/ashington state Legislature passed Senate Bill 6312, which became Chapter 225,Laws of V/ashington2}l4, calling for the integrated purchasing of mental health and substance abuse treatment services. Implementation of this law has brought about changes to how mental health and substance abuse treatment services are described and administered and delivered in King County. An integrated behavioral health system allows more flexibility to deliver holistic care especially for individuals with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders. One change initiated by behavioral health integration is the evolution of terminology used to define and describe the mental health and substance use disorder systems. King County uses \"behavioral health\" when referencing mental health and substance use disorder systems, reflecting the joining of systems through behavioral health integration. The MIDD sales tax-funded initiatives, programs and services supported by revenues levied under K.C.C 44.500.300 and outlined in the attached service improvement plan, which is Attachment A to this ordinance, continue the county's work to transform the approach to health and human services by improving health and well-being and creating conditions that allow residents of King County to achieve their full potential. Much has changed locally, at the state level and nationally in the realm of behavioral health the eleven years since the state Legislature authorized 2Ordinance 18406 counties to implement a one-tenth of one percent sales and use tax to support new programs and enhance the state's chemical dependency and mental health treatment services, and in the nine years since King County subsequently authorized the MIDD one-tenth of one percent sales and use tax levied under K.C.C. 44.500.300: the formerly separate mental health and chemical dependency services are integrated into one behavioral health system; the nation and region experienced a severe economic downturn and recovery; the federal Affordable Care Act was enacted; and there have been several changes in state laws impacting behavioral health services. Throughout all of these change events, King County's MIDD work became a platform for cross system engagement and improvement, collaboration and policy dialogue between the criminal justice and health and human services sectors. Ordinance 17998 called for the King County executive to transmit to the council two reports in preparation for the council's consideration of an ordinance that would continue the MIDD sales and use tax: 1. A comprehensive, historical review and assessment report of the MIDD- funded strategies, services and programs; and 2. A service improvement plan to guide the investment of a renewed MIDD sales tax. The comprehensive, historical review and assessment report transmitted to the Council on June 30,2016, recognized that in aggregate, MIDD sales tax-funded strategies, services and programs are successful and effective in meeting the established policy goals. Significant reductions in jail and 3Ordinance 18406 emergency department use and psychiatric hospitalizations are reflected in the report as documented by MIDD evaluation data. The comprehensive, historical review and assessment report of the MIDD sales tax-funded strategies, services and programs was developed with input from, and was reviewed by, the mental illness and drug dependency oversight committee, as required by Ordinance 17998. Ordinance 17998 called for the executive, with input from the MIDD oversight committee and community stakeholders, to review, update and revise the strategies outlined in the MIDD Implementation Plan adopted in Ordinance 1626I, and to submit a MIDD service plan to the council for review and approval. The MIDD service improvement plan that is Attachment A to this ordinance is intended to be used to guide investments of taxes levied under K.C.C 4A.500.300 beginning in the 201712018 biennium should the MIDD sales tax be renewed by the council before the tax expires on January I,2017. King County and its behavioral health and community stakeholders embraced the opportunity to review and learn from the MIDD work accomplished between 2008 and 2016, and plan for a robust, forward- looking MIDD for the next service period. The MIDD service improvement plan, Attachment A to this ordinance, represents the collaborative efforts over a nearly two-year period from a wide range of stakeholders including representatives from communities, provider agencies, courts, law enforcement, public health, the prosecuting attorney, 4Ordinance 18406 89 90 9L 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 10r. 102 103 to4 105 L06 t07 108 109 110 u,Lpublic defense, juvenile and adult justice systems, staff and elected officials from jurisdictions in King County, council staff and many others to thoughtfully plan for the use of MIDD revenues for the next service period. Community voices and priorities significantly influenced the development of the funding and programmatic recommendations incorporated in the attached MIDD service improvement plan. MIDD planning was conducted in a clear and straightforward way, involving the MIDD oversight committee at each step. As guided by the MIDD oversight committee, the county turned to citizens and community partners across the region for input and guidance in developing the recommendations. Between October 2015 and February 2016, fourteen MIDD focus groups were held involving specific communities, populations or subregional areas, including a focus group with individuals in the King County jail. Five regional community conversations were also held in partnership with best starts for kids planning efforts. Between in person meetings, an electronic survey and other methods of feedback, close to one thousand two hundred citizens and community members provided direct input into the development of the MIDD recommendations reflected in the attached service improvement plan. The attached MIDD service improvement plan builds on the success of the groundbreaking partnership between health and human services, criminal justice, King County government and community providers during the 5Ordinance I29 732 133r232005-2016 MIDD funding period. The recommended MIDD initiatives, policies and processes as described in the MIDD service improvement plan and consistent with RCW 82.14.460 have been informed by community and MIDD oversight committee input; are grounded in the county's social justice and equity work; driven by outcomes; guided by the behavioral health continuum of care; and aligned with other county policy initiatives. The recommended MIDD initiatives included in the attached MIDD service improvement plan are based in the theory of change that when people who are living with or who are at risk of behavioral health conditions utilize culturally-relevant prevention and early intervention, crisis diversion, community reentry, treatment and recovery services and have stable housing and income, they will experience wellness and recovery, improve their quality of life, and reduce involvement with crisis, criminal justice and hospital systems. As required by Ordinance l7998,the attached MIDD service improvement plan makes operational, programmatic, funding and policy recommendations for the implementation of the MIDD sales tax from 2017 fhrolgh2025. The recommendations contained in the MIDD service improvement plan reflect the current and evolving behavioral health needs of King County's citizens, behavioral health workforce challenges and a growing understanding of social justice and equity in the provision of behavioral health services. t34 6135 136 156 157Ordinance 18406 The county's equity and social justice initiative recognizes many communities within King County face inequities in key educational, economic, and health outcomes. Consequently, equity and social justice considerations are a major component in the initiatives outlined in the attached MIDD service plan and a driving factor for all aspects of implementing the next years of MIDD work. Guided by the understanding that how the work of MIDD is approached and accomplished is as important as what MIDD supported programs and services accomplish, the planning and development of the MIDD service improvement plan was conducted with a deep focus on social justice and equity. The initiatives in the MIDD service improvement plan, Attachment A to this ordinance, build on the successes of MIDD to date; ensure timely, affordable and culturally-appropriate access to behavioral health services that focus on recovery and resilience; improve community-based services and programs; and better meet the behavioral needs of people in need of services, thereby reducing costly incarceration and emergency room utilization. BE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF KING COUNTY: SECTION L X'indings: A. The initiatives contained in the service improvement plan attached to this ordinance or any future implementation plans may be expanded, revised or eliminated based on, but not limited to, the following reasons: changes to state law or county policy; performance data from the evaluation of sales-tax funded programs and strategies; 7Ordinance 18406 158 recommendation from the county executive or the mental illness and drug dependency 159 oversight committee; or county budgetary constraints. 160 B. The county recognizes that the needs of its residents may change over time 161 and that new and innovative behavioral health programs and services are continually 162 being developed and implemented across the country. Therefore, it is the policy of the 163 county that the county's mental illness and drug dependency sales tax-supported t64 programs shall maintain flexibility to respond to the changing needs of the county's 1.65 population as well as to accommodate new behavioral health services and programs. 166 SECTION 2. The mental illness and drug dependency service improvement plan, 1.67 as required in Ordinance 17998 and that is Attachment A to this ordinance, is hereby 168 approved to guide the investment investments of taxes levied under K.C.C 44.500.300. L69 The mental illness and drug dependency spending plan and financial plan, including the I170 L7I 172Ordinance 18406 next year's projected initiative allocations, is subject to review and possible modification in the county's budget process. Ordinance 18406 was introduced on 812912016 and passed by the Metropolitan King County Council on 1111412016, by the following vote: Yes: 9 - Mr. von Reichbauer, Mr. Gossett, Ms. Lambert, Mr. Dunn, Mr. McDermott, Mr. Dembowski, Mr. Upthegrove, Ms. Kohl-Welles and Ms. Balducci No:0 Excused:0 KING COUNTY, V/ASHINGTON J \u00f8o'l\u00dfg\u00bf. ro,u.

Executive Summary Much has changed locally, at the state level, and nationally in the realm of mental health and chemical dependency in the eleven years since the Washington State Legislature passed the Omnibus Mental Health and Substance Abuse Act in 2005 to enhance the state's chemical dependencyl and mental health treatment services, and in the nine years since King County subsequently authorized the one- tenth of one percent sales and use tax to fund new mental health, chemical dependency, or therapeutic court services enabled by the Legislature. From the integration of the formerly separate mental health and chemical dependency services systems into one behavioral health system, to the economic downturn and uptick, to the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, to changes in state laws, King County's Mental lllness and Drug Dependency (MIDD) has become more than a revenue source. The MIDD has become a platform for cross system engagement and improvement, collaboration and policy dialogue. ln accordance with Ordinance L7998, this Service lmprovement Plan makes operational, programmatic, funding and policy recommendations for the MIDD service period of 2Ot7-2025 (referred to in this document as \"MIDD 2\") should the King County Council extend the sales tax sunset date. The recommendations reflect the current and evolving behavioral health needs of King County's citizens, the reality of a challenged behavioral health workforce, and a growing understanding of equity and social justice in the provision of behavioral health services. King County embraced the opportunity to review and learn from the 2OO8-20L6 MIDD service period (referred to in this document as \"MIDD 1-\") and plan for robust, forward-looking MIDD sales tax supported initiatives, services, and programs for the 2017-2025 service period. This MIDD Service lmprovement Plan represents the collaborative efforts over a nearly two-year period from a wide range of internal and external stakeholders including representatives from communities, provider agencies, consumers, courts, law enforcement, public health, the prosecuting attorney, public defense, juvenile and adult justice systems, staff and elected officials from jurisdictions in King County, Councilstaff, and many others to thoughtfully plan for a renewed MIDD sales tax, This blueprint for MIDD builds on the success of the first MIDD which was a groundbreaking partnership between health and human services, criminal justice, King County government and community providers, and sets forth a path to overcome the few challenges of the first MIDD service period. The recommended initiatives, policies and processes that comprise MIDD 2 and are reflected in this Service lmprovement Plan are: \u00a1 informed by community and Oversight Committee input . grounded in the County's Equity and Social Justice work . driven by outcomes o guided by the behavioral health continuum of care . aligned with other County policy initiatives. l This term is used in its h\u00a1storic context to describe the State Legislature's act\u00a1ons. This term is replaced by \"substance use disorder\" in subsequent sections of this report.1 8406 Successful MIDD 1 programs are proposed to continue into MIDD 2, though some will be merged or retooled during the implementation planning and/or request for proposal (RFP) process. 21 new proposed initiatives are recommended for MIDD 2, bringing the total number of initiatives to 52. MIDD 2 reflects the integrated behavioral health system, \"busting silos\" so that services are person- centered, not program-centered. MIDD 2 was intentionally developed in collaboration with initiatives like Best Starts for Kids so that services and funding can be braided to achieve maximum impact. The proposed MIDD 2 initiatives prioritize: o Funding services and programs to keep people out of or returning to jail and the criminaljustice system, including upstream prevention and diversion activities. These include initiatives like: o Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) o Housing Capital and Rental Assistance o Crisis Diversion and Mobile Crisis Services, including expanding to South King County o Recovery Caf\u00e9. lnvesting in a treatment on demand system that delivers treatment to people who need it, how they need it, and when they need it so crises can be avoided or shortened. These include initiatives like: o Behavioral Health Urgent Care Walk ln Clinic pilot o Next Day Appointments o Peer Bridger and Peer Support. Creating community-driven grants so geographic and culturally diverse communities can customize behavioral health services for their unique needs. Community voices andpriorities significantly influenced the development of the proposed MIDD 2 funding and programmatic recommendations MIDD 2 planningwas conducted in a clearand straightforward way, involvingthe Oversight Committee at each step. As guided by the Oversight Committee, the county turned to citizens and community partners across the region for input and guidance in developing the MIDD 2 recommendations. Between October 2015 and February 201-6, county staff held 1-4 focus groups involving specific communities, populations, or sub-regional areas, including a focus group with individuals in the King County Jail. Between in person meetings, an electronic survey and other electronic feedback, close to l-,200 citizens and community members provided direct input into the development of the MIDD 2 recommendations. MIDD 2 continues the County's work to transform the approach to health and human services by improving health and well-being and creating conditions that allow residents of King County to achieve their full potential.a 6lPage1 8406 MIDD 2 is organized by the MIDD 2 Framework into four strategy areas that reflect a continuum from prevention to crisis services, linked to outcomes. The MIDD 2 Framework is an accountability structure driven by the results policymakers and stakeholders want to see in the community as the result of investment of MIDD funds; the indicators that the county will use to signal that it's headed down the right path to get there; and the actions the county and its partners will take to create the change stakeholders want to see. A major component of the MIDD 2 Framework is the creation of four MIDD strategy areas that echo the continuum of behavioral health care and services and include a vital system support area. Each of the proposed MIDD 2 initiatives is included in one of the four MIDD 2 Strategy Areas. The MIDD 2 Framework is a living document that will be further updated over the life of MIDD 2 to reflect specific programmatic and services once they are determined by the Executive and Council in 2016. The framework will continue to be updated over the life of MIDD 2 as a companion to the MIDD policy goals, Best Starts for Kids is proposed to support an estimated S2.9 million annually for prevention based behavioral health services for children and youth. Aligning MIDD 2 and Best Starts for Kids (BSK) has been a primary focus of the Department of Community and Human Services (DCHS). From holding joint Community Conversations, to collaborating on strategies and initiatives, to jointly reviewing MIDD 2 concepts and briefing papers, MIDD 2 planning and recommendations development has been a synergistic endeavor with BSK. This strong partnership will continue throughout the life of each of these initiatives, through planned joint meetings of the MIDD Oversight Committee and the Children and Youth Advisory Board and shared approaches to accomplishing the work of each initiative. Operationally, MIDD 2 and BSK are working to coordinate approaches to evaluation, contracting and reporting among other aspects.MIDD 2 Strategy Area Name Purpose Prevention and Early lnterventionPeople get the help they need to stay heolthy ond keep problems from escoloting Crisis DiversionPeople who ore in crisis get the help they need to avoid unnecessory hos pita lizotio n OR i nca rce rat\u00a1on Recovery and ReentryPeople become heolthy ond safely reintegrote to community after crisis System lmprovementsStrengthen the behaviorol heolth system to become more occessible and deliver on outcomes TlPage'18406 Summary of DRAFT MIDD 2 Service lmprovement plan Recommendations Recommendotions that require legislotion ore noted with \"*\" Area of RecomrnendationSIP Recommendat\u00a1ons MIDD Fund Financial Policies Recommendations')..

The ad hoc work group invites communities identified as needing a voice in MIDD while not creating an unwieldy Oversight Committee of 50 or more that would not be feasible to operate. A notable component of the Consumers and Communities Ad Hoc Work Group is that its members will be reimbursed for expenses incurred. Two Consumers and Communities Ad Hoc Work Group members would be recommended to serve as full members of the MIDD Oversight Committee, subject to the existing appointment and confirmation process. One of the two Consumers and Communities Ad Hoc Work Group members elected to participate on the Oversight Committee will be a consumer.

Next Steps & Conclusion The information in this report responds to the requirements of Ordinance 17998. Ordinance 1-7998 called for the transmittal of MIDD Service lmprovement Plan (SlP) in December of 2016. ln order to support the King County Council's desire for expanded review and input of the MIDD 2 9lPage1 8406 SlP, the SIP report called for by Ordinance 17998 is submitted three months earlier than required. The impact of this changed timeline is that two elements of the MIDD 2 - lmplementation and Evaluation Plans--require further development. Additionally, the policy goals that were established for MIDD 1 are recommended to be revised, which impacts implementation and evaluation planning outcomes. Developing lmplementation and Evaluation Plans will be conducted in collaboration with the MIDD Advisory Com mittee2 and providers. Three specific next steps are necessary for MIDD 2 - completion of the MIDD 2 lmplementation and Evaluation Plans and a process to change the name of the MIDD. Each step will be developed collaboratively with the MIDD oversight Committee and other stakeholders. The Executive recommends transmitting MIDD 2 lmplementation and Evaluation Plans to the Council in mid-20j.7 for review and acceptance, similar to the sequencing of MIDD 1. Additional planning is needed for most of the new initiatives contained in the proposed MIDD 2, many of them requiring community engagement components. Through the course of MIDD l review and MIDD 2 planning, the County received feedback that the name of the MIDD---the Mental lllness and Drus Dependencv sales tax and programs-is outdated, negative, disrespectful and stigmatizing. ln essence, the name of the MIDD is not itself recovery based and may be counterproductive to wellness. lt is recommended that the name of the MIDD be changed to something that more meaningfully and positively reflects the hope of recovery. Changing the name of the MIDD will require revision to the King County Code and other adopted legislation. Executive staff will work with the Code Reviser, the Prosecutor's Office and Council staff on this issue, ln keeping with the established process and timeline for the development of the Mental lllness and Drug Dependency Service lmprovement Plan, this document reflects Executive priorities for the programming and funding of Mental lllness and Drug Dependency revenues. ln addition to including Executive priorities for the spending of MIDD revenue, adjustments to certain proposed MIDD initiatives have occurred due to or more of the following factors: L. Updated Office of Financial Analysis (OEFA) MtDD sales tax projections 2. Revised Medicaid assumptions 3. Staged implementation assumptions of select initiatives3 Please see Appendix H, lnitiative Descriptions and Appendix M, Spending Plan for detailed funding and program matic recommendations. 2 Proposed legislation to rev\u00a1se the name of the MIDD Oversight Committee to the lvllDD Advisory Committee has been transmitted to the King County Council. Therefore, the term \"MIDD Advisory Committee\" is used in this document when referencing potent\u00a1al prospective acts by the current MIDD Oversight Comm\u00a1ttee, assuming King County Council approval of legislation that formally changes the name of the Committee from \"Oversight\" to \"Advisory.\" A discussion of the proposed name change occurs on page 60 of this document. 3 Staged lmplementation is discussed on page 43 of this report. 1-0lPageI 8406 ll. MIDD 1 and Key Environmental Changes History of MIDD 1 State Authorizes Revenue Tool: The Washington State Legislature passed the Omnibus Mental Health and Substance Abuse Act in 2005. ln addition to promoting a series of strategies to enhance the state's chemical dependency and mental health treatment services, the law authorized counties to levy a one- tenth of one percent sales and use tax to fund new mental health, chemical dependency ortherapeutic court services through Revised Code of Washington (RCW) 82.t4.460. @@ A county legislative outhority may authorize, fix, ond impose o soles and use tox in occordonce with the terms of this chapter.

The state statute has been amended severaltimes since its origination in 2005. The first change (2003) allowed for housing that is a component of a coordinated chemical dependency or mental health treatment program or service. Most notably, the statue was amended (2009 and 201_1) twice to allow for supplantation (backfill) of lost revenues by sales tax funds on a predetermined schedule, specifying a percentage of revenue per year allowed to be used as backfill. Another modification of the law specified the revenue may be used to support the cost of the judicial officer and support staff of a therapeutic court without be\u00a1ng considered as supplantation. During the 2015 legislative session, transpoftation was added to the list of mental health programs and services that may be supported by the revenue. King County's Mental lllness and Drug Dependency Sales Tax Enacted: ln 2007, the King County Council enacted the Mental lllness and Drug Dependency (MIDD) sales tax based on RCW g2.L4.I460 via Ordinance 1-5949' ln addition to authorizing the collection of sales tax revenue, Ordinance 1,Sg4g created a sunset date ofJanuary 1-,2017 for the sales tax. ordinance L5949 states: The expirotion of the tox is established to enoble progress toward meeting the county's policy goals outcomes, and to enoble evoluotions of the programs funded with the sales tox revenue to toke place and for the county to deliberate on the success of meeting policy gools and outcomes.a Ordinance 15949 established five policy goals for King County's MIDD sales tax shown below. These goals have guided and informed all aspects of the MIDD policy and services work since 2007. a King County Ordinance l-5949, section j\" H, lines 73-76. 12 lPage1 8406 MIDD Adopted Policy Goals Policy Goal 7: A reduction in the number of mentolly ill and chemically dependent people using costly interventions, such as, joil, emergency rooms, ond hospitals. Policy Goal 2: A reduction in the number of people who recycle through the jail, returning repeotedly as a result of their mentol illness or chemic\u00f8l dependency. Policy Goal 3: A reduction o\u00cd the inc\u00a1dence ond severity of chemical dependency and mentol and emotionol disorders in youth ond odults. Pol\u00edcy Goal 4: Diversion of mentolly ill ond chemicolly dependent youth and odults from initial or further justice system involvement. Policy Goal 5: Explicit linkage with, ond furthering the work of, other Council directed efforts including, the Adult and Juvenile Justice Operationol Master plons, the Plan to End Homelessness, the Veterans and Humon Services Levy Service lmprovement Plon and the King County Mentol Heolth Recovery Plan. Ordinance 15949 also included the Council's direction in two areas not addressed by the Action Plan. The Council required that the lmplementation Plan address expansion of King County's Adult Drug Diversion Court. The Council also required programs that supported specialized mental health or substance abuse counseling, therapy, and support for survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence for adults and children be integrated into the MIDD implementation planning. It is important to note that King County's MIDD was a groundbreaking collaboration between health and human service (HHS) and criminaljustice (CJ)service domains. Driven by compelling evidence from HHS and CJ leaders, policymakers created MIDD so that King County could begin to collectively address the high human and financial costs of individuals with behavioral health conditions (mental illness, substance use disorders and co-occurring disorders) recycling through the expensive criminal justice system. MIDD represented unprecedented coordination, collaboration and teamwork between the formerly stand-alone CJ and HHS systems. MIDD l was organized based on the Sequential lntercept Model, providing a framework to determine what services were needed under MIDD 1to help prevent incarceration, hospitalization and homelessness. lt is included as Appendix A to this report. MIDD l lmplementation: Oversight, lmplementation and Evaluation Plans: Ordinance 15949 called for key foundational planning documents necessary to the successful and transparent implementation of the MIDD. The legislation called on the Departments of Community and Human Services, Adult and Juvenile Detention, and Public Health; the Offices of the Public Defender and Prosecuting Attorney; and Superior and District Courts to develop and submit to the Council MIDD oversight, implementation and evaluation plans. 1\"3lPage1 8406 The MIDD Oversight Plan, adopted by Ordinance !6077, established the MIDD Oversight Committee. tt set the role and duties of the Oversight Committee, and established the composition of the Oversight Committee. As described in legislation, the Oversight Committee is responsible for the ongoing oversight of the MIDD services and programs funded with the sales tax revenue. lt acts as an advisory body to the Executive and the Council, reviewing and making recommendations on the implementation and effectiveness of the sales tax programs in meeting the five established policy goals. lt reviews and comments on all required reports and on emerging and evolving priorities for use of the MIDD funds. Ordinance 1-6077 states that the oversight Committee \"should promote coordination and collaboration between entities involved with sales tax programs; educate the public, policymakers, and stakeholders on sales tax funded programs; and coordinate and share information with other related efforts.\"5 Ultimately, the Oversight Committee's purpose is to ensure that the implementation and evaluation of the strategies and programs funded by the tax revenue are transparent, accountable and collaborative. The 30-member MIDD Oversight Committee meets regularly to discuss, review, and at times make recommendations on M|DD-related matters. Membership purposely includes a wide array of subject matter experts and stakeholder groups, including the Sound Cities Association (formerly Suburban Cities Association), and the cities of Bellevue and Seattle. There are eleven King County government seats on the committee. A complete list of current MIDD Oversight Committee seats and current members is included in Appendix B. The MIDD 1 lmplementation Plan was adopted via Ordinance 1626I on October 6, 2008. per Ordinance L5949, the MIDD lmplementation Plan was developed in collaboration with the Oversight Committee. The lmplementation Plan described the implementation of the programs and services outlined in the MIDD Action Plan. As required, it included a discussion of needed resources (staff, information and provider), milestones for implementation of programs and a spending plan. lt also addressed expansion of Adult Drug Court and mental health and substance abuse services for survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault. The lmplementation Plan grouped programs into five service areas: the first three were included in the MIDD Action Plan that was accepted by the King County Council in October 2007. The fourth service area of the MIDD lmplementation Plan reflected the Council's direction to address domestic violence and sexual assault mental health and substance abuse programs and Adult Drug Diversion Court. The fifth and final service area addresses the housing needs of individuals with serious mental illness and chemical dependency based on a change in State law which clarified the use of sales tax collections for housing. The five areas are detailed below: s Ordinance 16077 Section 1, E, lines 44-47 14 lPage1 8406 MIDD 1 Service Areas and Programming The lmplementation Plan for the 2008-2016 MIDD service period contained information on each individual program, called a \"strategy,\" including the following: \u00a1 A needs statement \u00a1 A description of services r A discussion of needed resources, including staff, information and provider contracts r Milestones for implementation of the program. The lmplementation Plan also included a schedule forthe implementation of programs, a 2008 spending plan and a financial plan for the mental illness and drug dependency fund. Finally, each program (strategy) included a list of linkages to other programs and planning and coordinating efforts, highlighting critical collaboration and coordination are necessary to the successful implementation of the MIDD Plan.MIDD l Service AreaMIDD Programs and Strategies Community-Based Careo a olncrease access to community mental health and substance abuse treatment for uninsured children, adults and older adults lmprove the quality of care by decreasing mental health caseloads and providing specialized employment services Provide supportive services for housing projects serving people with mental illness and chemical dependency treatment needs Programs Targeted to Help Youtho o o oExpand prevention and early intervention programs Expand assessments for youth in the juvenile justice system Provide comprehensive team-based, intensive \"wraparound\" services \u00cbxpand services for youth in crisis Maintain and expand Family Treatment Court and Juvenile Drug Court Jail and Hospital Diversiono a .iDivert people who do not need to be in jail or hospital through crisis intervention training for police and other first responders and by creating a crisis diversion facility Expand mental health courts and other post-booking services to get people out of jail and into services faster Expand programs that help individuals re-enter the community from jails and hospita ls Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault and Adult Drug Courto a a oAddress the mental health needs of children who have been exposed to domestic violence lncrease access to coordinated, early intervention mental health and substance abuse services for survivors of domestic violence lncrease access to treatment services for victims of sexual assault Enhance services available through the King County Adult Drug Diversion Court Housing DevelopmentaSupport capital projects and rental subsidies for people with mental illness and chemical dependency 1-5lPageI 8406 The adopted MIDD lmplementation Plan included two additional programs added by the Council that were not in the Executive's transmitted plan: Crisis lntervention Team / Mental Health partnership pilot Project and Safe Housing and Treatment for Children in Prostitution Pilot Project. The lmplementation Plan outlined the steps and timeline for creation of the comprehensive programming that became MIDD programs. The lmplementation Plan summarized the collaborative work of many entities over a two-year period to organize and develop the work that eventually became the MIDD. The document states that the lmplementation Plan is \"a product of a comprehensive, multi- jurisdictional plan to help youth and adults who are at risk for or suffer from mental illness or substance abuse.\"6 The MIDD Evaluation Plan, the third required component of Ordinance l-5949, was adopted by the Council on October L0, 2008 via Ordinance 1,6262. As specified in Ordinance Lsg4g, the Evaluation plan submitted to the Council was to contain process and outcome evaluation components, a schedule for evaluations, performance measurements and performance measurement targets, and data elements used for reporting and evaluations. Detailed direction on performance measures was also outlined in Ordinances 15949 and 16262, along with a quarterly report schedule and the specific components of annual and quarterly reporting. The legislation that adopted the Evaluation plan also outlined how and when revisions to the Evaluation Plan and processes, and performance measures and targets were to be communicated to the Council and the public. The MIDD Evaluation Plan identified a framework for evaluating most of the programs (strategies) in the MIDD lmplementation Plan except the two added by the Council Crisis lntervention Team / Mental Health Partnership Pilot Project and Safe Housing and Treatment for Children in prostitution pilot Project. The Evaluation Plan stated that evaluation would be accomplished \"by measuring what is done (output), how it is done (process), and the effects of what is done (outcome).\"7 Supplantationr The 2005 legislation authorizing counties to implement a one-tenth of one percent sales and use tax did not permit the revenues to be used to supplant other existing funding. During the 2009 and the 2011 legislative sessions, Washington State legislators approved changes to the state statute that modified the non-supplantation language of the law, and allowed MIDD revenue to replace (supplant) funds for existing mental health, chemical dependency and therapeutic court services and programs, not only new or expanded programs. lt also permitted MIDD funds to be used to support the cost of the judicial officer and support staff of a therapeutic court. The step down in supplantation funds was modified in 2011 as follows: \u00a1 2015:20 percent \u00a1 20L6:1-0 percent c 2017:0 percent (the King County MIDD l expires in January 2017; should MIDD be renewed, the 2OL7-20L8 budget would reflect zero supplantation). 6 Ordinance 16261, AttachmentA Mental lllness and Drug Dependency lmplementation plan Version 6 - Revised October 6, 2008 - FINAL, page 5. 7 Ordinance 1\"6262 Attachment A Mental lllness and Drug Dependency Act\u00a1on Plan Part 3 - Evaluation plan Version 2 REVISED 9-2-08'Pase1l' t.rpageI 8406 Replacement of lost Federalfunds is permitted. MIDD in 2016: MIDD serves thousands of people annually8, providing services to those who otherwise would not receive services. MIDD funding provides: . housing and supportive housing and case management services \u00a1 crisis diversion and mobile crisis services . full support for all of King County's therapeutic courts. Of the 37 original programs/strategies conceived by MIDD planners in 2006-2008,32 are operational. Two strategies, Crisis lntervention Team/Mental Health Partnership (17a) and Safe Housing and Treatment for Children in Prostitution (17b) secured funding from other sources and did not require ongoing MIDD funds. Three youth strategies: Services for Parents in Substance Abuse Outpatient Treatment (4a); Prevention Services to Children of Substance Abusing Parents (4b); and, Reception Centers for Youth in Crisis (7a), remain on hold. A substantially modified version of Strategy 7a known as FIRS (Family lntervention and Restorative Services) was awarded one time supplementalfunding during 201.5. Financially, the MIDD fund benefits from a healthy economy: in 2015 and again in early 201-6, the MIDD fund saw an undesignated fund balance. Compared to the economic downturn starting in 2009, when the Oversight Committee was asked to make recommendations on programmatic reductions necessitated by gravely reduced revenues,2015 and 201-6 fund balance resulted in opportunities to restore programs and address emerging needs. The Oversight Committee initiated a standing Fund Balance Review subcommittee to conduct analysis and have a menu of recommendations at the ready for future opportunities to utilize undesignated fund balance. Key Changed Conditions Impact\u00a1ng MIDD Since the passage of MIDD in 2OO7 there have been major seismic shifts in the mental health and substance abuse worlds, including the April 1-, 2016 merging of mental health and substance abuse systems into one behavioral health system. The leading change factors that necessitate retooling of MIDD are highlighted below. Behavioral Health lntegration: ln March 2014, the Washington State Legislature passed Senate Bill 63L2 calling for the integrated purchasing of mental health and substance abuse treatment services through managed care contracts by April 20L6, with full integration of physical and behavioral health care by January 2020. The law necessitated the creation of Behavioral Health Organizations (BHOs) to purchase and administer Medicaid funded mental health and substance use disorder services under managed care, BHOs are single, local entities that will assume responsibility and financial risk for providing substance use disordertreatment and the mental health services currently overseen bythe counties and 8 VtOO f ighth Annual Report, pg. 46:35,902 unduplicated clients during the October I,201,4to September 30, 2015 reporting period, with an additional 21,730 people served in large group Support Networks (RSNs). The BHO services include inpatient and outpatient treatment, involuntary treatment and crisis services, services in jail, and services funded by federal block Srants. King County Behavioral Health and Recovery Division will serve as the BHO for the King County region, lmplementation of ESSB 6312 has brought about changes to how behavioral health (including both mental health and substance abuse treatment) services are administered and delivered in King County. The biggest changes have been to the substance use disorder treatment system as it moved from its current fee for service payment structure to managed care. This includes new \"books of business\" for the County as well as changes to contracting, payment structures, data collection and reporting, and other administrative processes. An integrated behavioral health system allows more flexibility to deliver holistic care especially for individuals with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders. Notably, Senate Bill 631-2 requires that King County's new behavioral health system provide access to recovery support services, such as housing, supported employment and connections to peers, One important change initiated by behavioral health integration is the evolution of terminology used to define and describe the mental health and substance use disorder systems. King County is making the conscious effort to use the term \"behavioral health\" when referencing mental health and substance use disorder systems, reflecting the joining of systems through behavioral health integration. More information on statewide BHO development can be found here: https://www.dshs.wa.gov/bhsia/division-behavioral-hea lth-and-recovery/developing-behavioral-health- organizations Please also see pages 66-69 for additionaldiscussion of Behavioral Health lntegration Affordable Care Act: The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) builds on the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 and extends federal parity protections to millions of Americans. The parity law seeks to establish conformity of coverage for mental health and substance use conditions with coverage for medical and surgical care. The ACA builds on the parity law by expanding access to insurance coverage to more Americans through state based Health lnsurance Exchanges and by expanding the financial eligibility for Medicaid to t33% of Federal Poverty Level. Expanded coverage and access coupled with parity ensures coverage of mental health and substance use disorder benefits for people who have historically lacked these benefits, Since January L,20t4, when Washington State took advantage of Medicaid expansion under the ACA, King County has seen a significant increase in the number of people enrolled in Medicaid. As of June 1-, 201-6, approximately L65,000 individuals have become newly eligible for Medicaid services in King County; of those, about 1-0,000 had accessed outpatient mental health services from the King County RSN. As of June t,201-6, there are approximately 405,000 Medicaid-covered individuals in King County. Because the RSN (and now the BHO) is paid on a per member per month basis from the state, the increase in Medicaid eligible individuals has resulted in revenue growth. This in turn has allowed the 1\"8lPageI 8406 King County BHO to raise outpatient case rates paid to providers. Unfortunately, the system is experiencing a bow wave: the behavioral health system is struggling to find and/or retain trained, licensed and qualified staff to provide services to this expanded population. Providers statewide report difficulty hiring and retaining the additional staff they need to fill demand, Workforce development is discussed in detail in a subsequent section of this document. Prior to implementation of the ACA, most people served in the substance use disorder treatment system were not eligible for Medicaid, as Medicaid eligibility was determined by a combination of income and disability and having solely a substance use disorder was not considered a qualifying condition for federal disability. Those with a dual diagnosis (substance use disorder with mental health diagnosis) were required to prove that the mental health diagnosis was present and diagnosed prior to beginning substance use or had to be able to rem,ain abstinent for a considerable amount of time to show the continued presence of a mental health condition. Thus, prior to ACA, many individuals with co-occurring disorders did not receive needed substance use disorder services. Under the ACA, persons no longer needed to qualify for eligibility based on disability, but rather can qualify for Medicaid solely based on income. This has resulted in a significant increase in clients becoming eligible for Medicaid and therefore eligible to receive Medicaid funded substance use disordertreatment. As of February 2016,87 percent of publicly-funded adults and 76 percent of youth in substance use disorder outpatient treatment were on Medicaid. As with the mental health system, the massive conversion of funding for treatment to Medicaid has impacted providers. On average Medicaid reimbursement rates are 20-25 percent less than what treatment agencies were paid for the same clients for the same service provided prior to ACA. The previous rates were already unsustainable, but the Medicaid rate has been even more difficult for providers to operate under. These lower rates prevent agencies from providing appropriate pay for well- qualified staff, hence leading to staff leaving, and the inability to hire qualified staff turning into a workforce drought. While the legislature did provide for some rate increases on the substance use disorder treatment side during the most recent session (56.8M statewide), the impact of reduced rates is still deeply experienced by providers. Moving the system to managed care in April 2016 provides another opportunity to increase rates to providers, although the system continues to be significantly underfunded. Resource Scarcity: Over the years since MIDD was authorized, there have been significant reductions in a variety of critical resources. Major cuts to flexible non-Medicaid mental health funds from the state have deeply impacted access to behavioral health services. These non-Medicaid funds are prioritized for crisis, involuntary commitment, residential, and inpatient services and play an important role in creating and maintaining a comprehensive continuum of community-based behavioral care, They also enable King County to facilitate treatment access for individuals who do not have Medicaid. 19 lPageState Flexible Non-Medicaid Mental Health \u00cd\u00a1,(, e\u00f1(fF\\\u00a11 8406 Table 1 As shown in Table L between state fiscal years 2009 and 2016, there was a loss of S40.g m\u00a1ll\u00a1on (34 percent) statewide for these critical services, and funding continues at this low level for state fiscal year 2OI7 as well' The reductions have had deep and dramatic effects on c\u00f3mmunities'abilityto respond to growing need and mainta\u00edn or develop creative solutions to improve outcomes for individuals with mentalhealth and/or substance use disorders. Another aspect to resource scarcity is the ongoing structural deficit of King County's General Fund. For the upcoming2olT-ZOIB biennium, the GeneralFund is facing a SSO million deficit. About 75 percent of the GeneralFund is used to support the county's criminaljustice system, including the jail, the courts, prosecution and defense, and the Sheriff's Office. Due to the $50 million General Fund deficit, the County is exploring all options to have other funding sources, like the MIDD sales tax, support programs that would relieve pressure on the General Fund. However, the ability to use MIDD revenue to support previously existing programs is limited by a supplantation restriction in the state MIDD statute, which requires MIDD funding be used on \"r\u00ecew or expanded programs or services.\" One exception to the supplantation restriction in the MIDD statute is therapeutie c\u00a1urt activities (e.g. Mental Health Court or Drug Court). Therapeutic courts were originally funded by the General Fund before being funded by the first MIDD. The MIDD 2 spending plan that is included with this report reflects the continued support of King County's four existing therapeutic courts by the MIDD, High Treatment Need: Severe resource scarcity has coexisted with a very high prevalence of treatment need in Washington as compared to other states. Analysis of data from the federal Substance Abuse and 20 lPage1 8406 Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA) 2010-11 Mental Health Surveillance Survey found that Washington ranked in the top three among states in the prevalence of any mental illness (24 percent of the population) and serious mental illness that substantially affected one or more major categories of functioning (seven percent).s Population Growth: The population of King County grew by an estimated 22 percent between 2000 and 2Ot5 - almost 380,000 people..Meanwhile, the state's population increased by approximalely 22 percent as well - or nearly L.3 million.l0 Even this one factor alone - the addition of so many more residents - would have placed more pressure on an overstretched community behavioral health treatment system. Emergency System Use: More and more people are seeking psychiatric care via hospital emergency departments (EDs) - in 2007,12.5 percent of adult ED visits were mental health-related, as compared to 5.4 percent just seven years earlier. Of 2OO7 psychiatric ED visits, 41 percent result in a hospital admission, over two and a half times the rate of ED visits for other conditions,ll and between 200L and 2006 the average duration of such visits was 42 percent longer than for non-psychiatric issues.12 The growth in these figures may result from the difficulty people experience in accessing community mental health services before they are in crisis, as well as the dramatic reduction in inpatient psychiatric capacity nationally, that began as part of deinstitutionalization in the 1960s and has continued untilvery recently.13 ln King County and Washington State, treatment access challenges and associated emergency system use have been driven by a confluence of factors: community and inpatient resources are scarce, while at the same time treatment need is very high and the population is growing quickly. Court Rulings Psychiatric Boarding; On August 7,2014, the Washington State Supreme Court ruled that hospital boarding of involuntarily detained individuals in mental health crisis, absent medical need, is unconstitutional. Psychiatric boarding or \"boarding\" became shorthand for the treatment access crisis that resulted when community need for inpatient mental health care - especially involuntary treatment - exceeded appropriate available resources. When appropriate treatment beds were not available, s Burley, M. & Scott, A. (2015). lnpatient psychiatric capacity and utilization in Washington State (Document Number L5-01.- 54L02).

Psychiatric boarding hurts patients and drives resources away from community-based and preventive care. Studies show that prolonged waits in EDs for psychiatric patients are associated with lower quality mental health care.laThis has been a nationwide problem that had been affecting Washington and King County since at least 2009. The Washington State Supreme Court, in its 2014 ln re the Detention of D.W. ef o/ decision, defined psychiatric boarding as temporarily placing involuntarily detained people in emergency rooms and acute care centers to avoid overcrowding certified facilities, ln doing so, the Court emphasized the inappropriateness of the placement, and the chief reason for not providing inpatient psychiatric care at the right time - lack of bed capacity.ls State and local partners, including the Community Alternatives to Boarding Task Force16, are developing system innovations and deploying new resources strategically to improve access to care, Local flexible resources like MIDD play a key part in expanding treatment capacity in King county. Forensic Competency Evaluations: ln April 2015, a U.S. District Court judge issued a permanent injunction ordering the Washington Department of Social and Health Services to provide competency evaluations to individuals in jails within seven days of booking, Judges order competency evaluations for individuals who are detained when they have concerns about whether the person arrested is able to assist with his or her defense. lf the person is found incompetent, the judge orders treatment to have competency restored, Two key drivers impacting the length of time individuals spend in jails awaiting competency evaluation also impact King County's behavioral health system: lack of evaluation services and the lack of bed space and staffing at the state's two forensic hospitals. As part of the state's response to this new mandate, resources have been committed to start pilot programs in King County to address competency in local communities, expediting evaluation and diverting some defendants away from state hospital stays for competency restoration. Other Change Drivers Community Behavioral Health Workforce in Crisis: There are many cascading effects of the expansion of services provided under ACA along with the realities of resource scarcity that are gravely impacting the workforce charged with providing services to a growing population. Major workforce challenges negatively impact the publicly funded behavioral health care system when trained, licensed and qualified staff are difficult to find and/or retain in community provider organizations. 1a Bender, D., Pande, N., Ludwig, M.

Studies of the situation in Washington have found that there is now a greater awareness of behavioral health needs among human service providers, faith communities, medical, and housing providers; an aging population coping with chronic conditions including mental health and substance abuse issues; and greater attention to the behavioral health needs of veterans. Also, there is increasing need for workers with multiple credentials in order to serve clients who have multiple behavioral health treatment needs or who are receiving care in integrated care settings. At the same time, many longtime behavioral health professionals are retiring or nearing retirement, and fewer younger workers are seeking a career in human services, leading to significant competition in the labor market.20 High caseloads and low wages in community behavioral health make it easy for qualified staff to be recruited away by entities like the Veteran's Administration and private health care systems that can pay more and/or forgive student loans. lt is also difficult to recruit psychiatrists, nurse practitioners, and nurses to public sector behavioral health due to a small candidate pool and challenges in offering competitive salaries. The behavioral health workforce, particularly in public sector settings, also experiences high turnover due, in part, to burnout, stress and lack of professional support. Ongoing reductions in funding for public behavioral health contribute to staff turnover and recruitment challenges. Without workforce improvements, King County will not be able to meet service needs, lndividuals who desperately require lifesaving services could go untreated, resulting in high costs, both human and financial. The County is uniquely positioned to both participate in and lead aspects of workforce development in partnership with providers, consumers and policy makers.

Recovery and Reentry - A recovery-oriented framework has at its center the individual: a person- centered approach to services and treatment that is embedded in self-determination. The framework asks that individuals be honored for their own healing processes, supported by the belief that people can and will recover despite winding up at the extreme ends of crisis systems - in jails or hospitals. The initial MIDD was based on the concept of decriminalization of mental health and substance use following the National GAINS Center Sequential lntercept model. Building on the model and following emerging practices, King County embraces a recovery-oriented framework for all individuals served in its behavioral health system. This practice enables King County to better address the needs of individuals with complex behavioral and other health conditions who are incarcerated, or at risk of incarceration, throughout King County. lt is well documented that individuals with complex behavioral health conditions are overrepresented in criminal justice settings nationally. Reentry and transition from hospital or jail planning can work well when behavioral health and criminal justice systems collaborate to support recovery.2l King County recognizes that it is criticalto view reentry from a recovery lens in order to best serve some of our community's most marginalized populations. Reentry services must be rooted in a recovery- oriented framework with interventions that include: peer support; diverse culturally competent services; holistic healthcare that is integrated across mental health, substance use and primary care; housing assistance and employment supporU and support for essential and basic needs. As the Sequential lntercept model notes, community-based services are key for individuals leaving jails and hospitals, and successfully integrating into communities of their choice. Trouma-lnformed Care Emphosis - King County is moving to utilizing a trauma-informed care framework whenever possible. Trauma-informed care is an approach to engaging people with histories of trauma that recognizes the presence of trauma symptoms and acknowledges the role that trauma has played in their lives. Trauma-informed care seeks to change the paradigm from one that asks, \"What's wrong with you?\" to one that asks, \"What has happened to you?\" Trauma-informed organizations, programs and services are based on an understanding of the vulnerabilities or triggers of trauma survivors so as to be more supportive and avoid re-traumatization. Most individuals seeking public behavioralhealth and other public services have histories of physicaland sexual abuse and other types of trauma-inducing experiences.22 These experiences often lead to mental 21 Blanford, Alex M. and Fred C. oshe.

Providing services under a trauma-informed framework can result in better outcomes than \"treatment as usual.\" A variety of studies have revealed that programs utilizing a trauma-informed model are associated with a decrease in psychiatric symptoms and substance use. Some programs have shown an improvement in daily functioning and a decrease in trauma symptoms, substance use and mental health symptoms.23'24 Trauma-informed care may lead to decreased utilization of crisis-based services. Some studies have found decreases in the use of intensive services such as hospitalization and crisis intervention following the im plementation of trauma-informed services.25 King County's Equity and Social Justice Agend\u00f8 - The County's Equity and Social Justice Agenda recognizes that race, place and income impact quality of life for residents of King County and people of color, those who have limited English proficiency and who are low-income persistently face inequities in key educational, economic and health outcomes. These inequities are driven by an array of factors including the tax system, unequal access to the determinants of equity, subtle but pervasive individual bias, and institutional and structural racism and sexism. These factors, while invisible to some, have profound and tangible impacts for others, At the same time, King County's adopted Strategic Plan identifies the principle of \"fair and just\" as a cornerstone incorporated into the work of all aspects of King County government. The region's economy and quality of life depends on the ability of all people to contribute, and King County seeks to remove barriers that limit the ability of some to fulfilltheir potential. While King County government has made progress, especially with regard to pro-equity policies, there is still a long way to go. Though the County's ability to create greater levels of institutional and regional equity may be limited by the scope of its services and influence, by working collaboratively with providers, consumers and other stakeholders, further improvements will be made. ln October of 2OI4 Executive Constantine signed an Executive Order calling for advancing equity and social justice in King County, along with the development of a countywide Equity and Social Justice Strategic Plan. Planning of MIDD 2 is driven in large part by the County's commitment to enacting its Equity and SocialJustice Agenda.

Sienificant reductions in jail and emergency department use, and psychiatric hospitalizations, are documented by MIDD evaluation data. The Comprehensive Historical Review and Assessment Report also identified a number of recommendations to improve evaluations of MIDD 2.

Key Components of MIDD 2 Overview The 2016 MIDD Service lmprovement Plan represents the collaborative efforts over a nearly two-year period from a wide range of internal and external stakeholders, including representatives from communities, provider agencies, courts, law enforcement, public health, the prosecuting attorney, public defense, juvenile and adult justice systems, staff and elected officials from jurisdictions in King County, Council staff, and many others. The product of this work is the MIDD 2 Service lmprovement Plan which is a comprehensive, multi-jurisdictional proposal to help people living with, or at risk of, behavioral health conditions are healthy, have satisfying social relationships, and avoid criminaljustice involvement. lt builds on the success of the first MIDD which was a groundbreaking partnership between health and human services, criminal justice and King County government and community providers, and sets forth a path to overcome the few challenges of MIDD 1. The recommended initiatives, policies and processes that comprise MIDD 2 are\u00a1 informed by community and Oversight Committee input. grounded in the County's Equity and Social Justice worko driven by outcomes; r guided by the behavioral health continuum of care. aligned with other County policy initiatives. Differences between MIDD l and Proposed MIDD 2 Development of Proposed MIDD 2 Recommendations The MIDD 2 planning process was co-created by the MIDD Oversight Committee. lt was intentionally crafted to be transparent and provide ample opportunities for review and input. Hundreds of citizens and community members engaged in the various elements of the MIDD 2 planning process, from completing a survey, to submitting a new concept, to participating in a community conversation or focus group' Regular updates were provided on MIDD 2 planning to provider networks, jurisdictional coalitions, elected officials, Council and Executive staff and internal county stakeholders. A website was launched so that all relevant MIDD 2 planning documents and updates could be easily accessed. Below highlights some of more notable elements of MIDD 2 planning. Oversight Committee Guidance and lnput: The MIDD Oversight Committee performed a critically imporlant role in MIDD 2 planning. ln March 20L5, the MIDD Oversight Committee established ValuesMIDD 1 Proposed MIDD 2 aOrganized into five service areas that are a mix of services and populationsOrganized into four strategy areas corresponding to the behavioral health continuum of carea aConstructed to support two separate systems: mental health and substance useBased on an integrated system of behavioral health servicesa aEnvisioned to support expansion of existing therapeutic courtsSupports entirety of therapeutic courtsa 23lPage1 8406 and Guiding Principles to inform all aspects of MIDD l- review work and MIDD 2 renewal planning activities. County staff and Oversight Committee members relied on these values and guiding principles as benchmarks as well as used them as checks and balances throughout MIDD 2 planning. The Values and Guiding Principle informed everything about MIDD 2 from the development of outreach and communications plans, to recommendations contained in this report. The values and guiding principles served as cues for the transparent and collaborative approach the County executed for the review of planning for, and implementation of, a potential MIDD 2, MIDD Oversight Committee members and/or the MIDD Renewal Strategy Team26 reviewed and provided feedback on the recommendations contained within this report. Additionally, the Oversight Committee has reviewed and provided feedback on major MIDD review and renewal planning documents, including the MIDD 2 Framework which is the basis of recommended revisions to the MIDD policy goals and a key driver of recommended revisions to the potential MIDD 2 evaluation approach. The MIDD 2 Framework is discussed in detail later in this section of the report. By the time this report is transmitted to the Council, it will have been formally reviewed and discussed in at least two MIDD Oversight Committee meetings. Every effort will be made to reflect MIDD Oversight 26 The Oversight Committee appointed a MIDD Renewal Strategy Team comprised of eight Oversight Committee members, representing an array of populations and stakeholders and including staff from the county's executive and legislative branches, to facilitate a higher degree of collaboration and input from the Oversight Committee. The Strategy Team provided guidance and expertise for MIDD l\" review and MIDD 2 planning activities to BHRD staff. lntended to augment Oversight Committee feedback and input, the MIDD Oversight Comm\u00a1ttee Strategy Team provided in-depth reviews of MIDD 1 review and MIDD 2 planning activ\u00a1tles and documents, The Strategy Team facilitated analysis, identified issues, offered subject matter expertise, and helped to problem-solve with county staff charged w\u00ecth completing the tasks required by Ordinance 1-7998.Cultural competency lens with an Equity and Social Justice (ESJ) focus Client centered; developed with consumer input Ensure voices of youth and disenfranchised populations are represented Self sustaining; partnerships that leverage sustainability when possible Community driven, not county driven Tra nsparent Recovery focused Driven by documented outcomes Based in promising or best practices; evidence-based when possible Common goal(s) across all organizations Strategies move us toward integration and are transformational MIDD funding leverages criminaljustice (CJ) system (youth and adult) changes Supports King County's vision for health care; reflects the triple aim: improved patient care experience, improved population health, and reduced cost of health care More upstream / prevention services Coordinated services Community- based organizations on equal status with County for compensation Continue legacy of CJ/human services coming together Open to new ways of achieving results Build on strengths of the system Services are accessible to those with limited optionso I o a a a a 29 lPage1 8406 Committee feedback into the final version of this report that is transmitted to the Council. Citizen and Community lnput: King County conducted its MIDD renewal planning work with an unprecedented level of transparency and community engagement. The Department of Community and Human Services (DCHS) planned and collaboratively developed the deliverables required by Council by sharing information and involving internal and external partners and communities. ln order to develop responsive and relevant MIDD 2 initiatives, King County turned to residents and community partners across the region for input and guidance. lnformed by the MIDD Oversight Committee's Values and Guiding Principles, King County staff conducted a robust outreach and engagement process around MIDD renewal. From September 2015 through February 20L6, King County invited citizens and communities to participate in five regional Community Conversations on MlDD.27 Between October 2015 and February 201'6, county staff held L4 focus groups involving specific communities, populations, or sub-regional areas, including a focus group with individuals in the King County Jail. The purpose of these engagement efforts was to hear ideas about services and programs for people living with mental illness and substance use disorders from those who need, use or engage with our county systems. The conversations were intentionally designed so that community members had a role in informing the County's decisions around its investments for children and youth and investments for mental health and substance use disorder services and programs. Focus groups ranged in size from as few as four to over 1\"00 participants. Groups included, in order of meeting: \u00a1 Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Service providers o Behavioral Health Organization Leaders . Real Change Vendors (consumers) \u00a1 Southeast King County/Maple Valley . Asian/ Pacific lslander Communities o Hispanic Recovery Caf\u00e9 (consumers) . Refugee Forum . Black/African American Communities o Northeast King County/Snoqualmie Valley r Native American Communities \u00a1 Transgenderlndividuals \u00a1 Somali Health Board . King County Jail Detainees. MIDD staff also conducted an electronic survey between September 2015 and February 20i.6. Over 360 respondents took the time to answer key questions about MIDD. Summaries and themes from these groups are available on the MIDD renewalwebsite, along with the MIDD survey data. Please see Appendix C for a summary of community engagement themes, 27 Community Conversations were held in partnership with King County staff planning for what became Best Starts for Kids. 30 lPage1 8406 Three Phased MIDD Renewal Process: ln addition to the vigorous community engagement work, a structured three phased review and renewal process was established in collaboration with the MIDD Oversight Committee. This process enabled the widest possible access to MIDD 2 funding and facilitated a coordinated analysis of new concepts and existing MIDD 1 programming. The process included: l. PHASE I - lnterested parties submitted New Concepts to the County between September L5, 2Ot5 and October 3L,2015. After initial screening of the concept forms to ensure fitness under the RCW, they were forwarded to Phase 2. Only a handful of concepts were not moved forward out of the L41 received, ll. PHASE ll - County staff drafted over 90 briefing papers in consultation with behavioral health partners, providers and subject matter experts. B\u00ceiefing papers provided answers to important analytical questions. The process specifically involved review of the papers by concept submitters and every effort was made by DCHS to reflect feedback from concept submitters whenever possible while striving to provide objective analysis.2s The second step of Phase 2 were panel reviews of existing strategy and new concept briefing papers, with the panels sorting the strategies and concepts into high, medium and low categories for potential funding consideration. Four panels, corresponding to the four MIDD 2 strategy areas, convened in March 201-6. Over 50 individuals participated on the review panel teams. The panels were intentionally constructed to bring in a diverse array of lived experiences, skills, knowledge, perspectives and insights to the sort\u00a1ng process. Each review panel team had a mix of community members and MIDD Oversight Committee members or their designees. Guiding factors provided to the review panels to use as they conducted their reviews of the briefing papers included questions on community needs, equity and social justice, integration, and recovery and reentry. See Appendix D for the briefing paper panel sorting results. Briefing papers can be found on the MIDD website: http://www. kingcou nty.gov/M lDDrenewa l. lll. PHASE lll - County staff aligned MIDD 2 programmatic recommendations, developing the recommendations and identifying funding levels. County staff assessed all existing MIDD 1 programs and potential new concepts for fit, value and ability to help the County achieve MIDD policy goals. The initial recommendations were released to the MIDD Oversight Committee and for public review and. a two week public comment period on April 22, 2016. Over 200 public comments were received. County staff made revisions to the draft MIDD 2 funding and programmatic recommendations in May, with revised recommendations released on May 20. Two Oversight Committee meetings (April and May) were dedicated to the review of and feedback on the draft funding and programmatic recommendations. Please see Appendix E for the detailed MIDD 2 process overview 28 lnstructions for the New Concept process clearly noted that concepts may be altered, revised, or combined, in briefing papers. 31 lPage1 8406 MIDD 1 Policy Goals & Proposed Modifications MIDD L's adopted policy goals are the foundational expression of what policymakers expected the MIDD to achieve, or work towards achieving. The policy goals provided the essential framing for all elements of the MIDD, includingthe MIDD L lmplementation and Evaluation Plans. The primaryfocus of the MtDD i- evaluation was to determine progress of MIDD-supported programs toward meeting the five policy goa ls. Ordinance 1-5949 established five policy goals for King County's MIDD sales tax shown below. These goals have guided and informed all aspects of the MIDD policy and services work since 2007. MIDD 2007 Adopted Policy Goals Policy Goal 1: A reduction in the number of mentally ill and chemically dependent people using costly intervention like, jail, emergency rooms, and hospitals; Policy Goal 2: A reduction in the number of people who recycle through the jail, returning repeatedly as a result of their mental illness or chemical dependency; Policy Goal 3: A reduction of the incidence and severity of chemical dependency and mentaland emotionaldisorders in youth and adults; Policy Goal 4: Diversion of mentally ill and chemically dependent youth and adults from initial or further justice system involvement; and Policy Goal 5: Explicit linkage with, and furthering the work of, other Council directed efforts including, the Adult and Juvenile Justice Operational Master plans, the plan to End Homelessness, the Veterans and Human Services Levy Service lmprovement plan and the County Recovery Plan. Calling for proposed modifications to the MIDD policy goals through Ordinance !7gggzs, the Council recognized that the behavioral health and criminal justice environments have changed since 2007 when the MIDD 1 policy goals were established via Ordinance 15949 and that refined policy goals may be necessary for MIDD 2. As required, the requested modifications to the adopted MIDD policy goals were submitted to the Council \u00a1n the Comprehensive Historical Assessment Report submitted to the Council on June 30, 2016. Because of the fundamental role of the MIDD policy goals for the implementation of MIDD 2, this Service lmprovement Plan includes the proposed modifications to the goals that were recommended in the Comprehensive Historical Assessment Report submitted to the Council on June 30. They are also included in this report because the Proposed MIDD 2 lnitiative Descriptions reference the 2007 policy goals AND the proposed modified goals. Person-Centered Language and Goals: Revised MIDD policy goals reflect a person-centered language approach. Person-centered language strives to avoid dehumanizing terms for individuals and groups 2e Ordinance 17998, lines 103-104 32 lPage1 8406 that demean or create barriers to inclusion. For example, instead of saying, \"the mentally ill,\" person- centered language would say \"individuals with mental illness.\" This approach also aligns with RCW 44.04.280, based on 2004 HB 2663, which directed state statue to avoid non-person first language.30 MIDD Oversight Committee members serving on the MIDD Renewal Strategy Team reviewed and discussed the recommended revisions to the policy goals. Strategy Team members noted that a key driver of the modified policy goals is the desire lo focus on meeting the needs of people rother thon on meeting system needs. For example, the recommended revision for policy goal L below reflects the recognition that diverting people with behavioral health needs out of the justice system is a more constructive goal than reducing the number of people who are using costly interventions. Recommended Policy Goal 1 captures the primary intended outcome described in the 2007 policy goals 1-,2, and 4 by directly addressing criminal justice system involvement as an indicator of return on investment. The goal is revised to use recovery-oriented person-first language, and now explicitly includes efforts to completely prevent criminaljustice system contact via diversion alongside efforts to serve those who have a history of criminaljustice system involvement. Recommended Policy Goal 2 addresses the emergency medicalsystem use aim of the 2007 policy goal 1- by addressing reduction of behavioral health crises, lt further recognizes that return on investment inRECOMMENDED REVIS]ONS TO MID\u00d0 POLICY GOALS 2007 Policy Goal Recommended Revised Folicy Goal, 1\".

Explicit linkage with, and furthering the work ol other King County and community in itiatives. 30 http://a pp. leg.wa.gov/RCW/defau lt,aspx?cite=44.O4.280 33 lPage1 8406 this area can be achieved either by reducing how often people are in crisis, or helping people in crisis stabilize more quickly. Recommended Policy Goal 3 targets a common and significant theme from MIDD's community outreach efforts around improving and supporting culturally-appropriate services, lt further reflects recent years' advancements in recovery-oriented approaches to care, and actively supports King County's equity and socialjustice aims. Recommended Policy Goal 4 builds on the vision of the 2007 policy goal 3 by recasting reduction of behavioral health disorders and symptoms within the positive frame of improving health and wellness. ln so doing, this goal now supports current system change efforts to provide people with behavioral health conditions with an integrated care experience that addresses needs across different domains including physical health care, and reflects an approach to recovery. Recommended Policy Goal 5 refines 2007 policy goal 5 by recognizing that linkage with system change efforts are essential and that such system work is constantly evolving. As recommended, this policy goal would support MIDD's engagement with a broad range of initiatives in King County, including community-driven initiatives. This report acknowledges an underlying factor related to the MIDD policy goals and to MIDD overall: MIDD programs and services alone cannot achieve the policy goals. o For example, simple changes to policing practices or prosecution policies can greatly impact the number of people who enter the criminaljustice system. After such a shift, data could suggest that MIDD services were either more or less successful in reducing the number of people who returned to jail, irrespective of the individuals' behavioral health conditions, when the larger driver may actually have been the criminaljustice policy changes. Likewise, shifts in federal or state funding or policies for behavioral health services impact the amount, availability and/or quality of behavioral health services, which in turn influences the incidence and severity of behavioral health conditions. For example, many MIDD services provide enhancements to underlying services provided via federal or state funding, or are designed to address gaps between such services. When core state or federal services are reduced, or more rarely expanded, this is likely to affect the apparent effectiveness and/or relevance of the MIDD-funded service.a aFinally, macroeconomic factors including access to employment and affordable housing - both of which are well beyond MIDD's capacity to impact in a substantive way - have a major effect on recovery outcomes. ln light of these factors, the recommended policy goal revisions clearly highlight the fundamental intentions of MIDD 2 while at the same time recognizing its limitations. These proposed revised MIDD policy goals focus primarily on expected results for MIDD program participants and improvements in access to services. 34 lPage1 8406 MIDD 2 Framework MIDD 2 is rooted in the County's work to transform the approach to health and human services by improving health and well-being and creating conditions that allow residents of King County to achieve their full potential. This is reflected throughout the planning and development of MIDD 2 recommendations and summarized in the MIDD 2 Framework. The MIDD 2 Framework is an accountability framework driven by the results policymakers and stakeholders want to see in the community as the result of investment of MIDD funds; the indicators that the county will use to signalthat it's headed down the right path to get there; and the actions the county and its partners will take to create the change stakeholders want to see. To inform this framework, DCHS drew upon the principles of results-based accountability practices among other elements, including the Sequential lntercept Model.3l The MIDD 2 Framework is shown in Appendix F. The MIDD 2 Framework identifies and organizes the central components of MIDD 2. lt identifies the MIDD 2 approach at four different levels: 1)What willhappen as a result of MIDD services 2)The theory of change driving the result of MIDD 3) Key strategies and outcomes intended to achieve MIDD's 2 result 4) Sample performance measures used to demonstrate progress toward outcomes The MIDD 2 Framework shows the outcomes of MIDD 2 as divided into two areas: population and individual outcomes. Each level of outcomes has associated indicators and measures. There are two very important caveats associated with MIDD outcomes and indicators. L. Population outcomes are predicated on the understanding that MIDD alone is not responsible for broader population outcomes. MIDD, along with other King County and community initiatives work together to contribute to the overall health and well-being of King County residents that is demonstrated by positive outcomes. 2. Performance measures and indicators for MIDD 2 will be identified after the funding andMIDD Result: People living with, or ot risk of, behoviorol heolth conditions ore healthy, hove sotisfying social relationships, and avoid criminol justice involvement. MIDD Theory of Change: When people who ore living with, or who ore ot risk of, behoviorol heolth disorders utilize culturolly-relevant prevention and early intervention, crisis diversion, community reentry, treatment, and recovery services, ond hove stoble housing and income, they will experience wellness ond recovery, improve their quolity of life, and reduce involvement with crisis, criminol justice ond hospitol systems. 31 The Sequential lntercept Model is discussed on page 63. 35 lPage1 8406 programmatic decisions are made by the Executive and Council. The measures and indicators must be developed in partnership with providers and other stakeholders. 3. The MIDD 2 Evaluation Framework will include performance measures and indicators necessary to gather and report on population and individual outcomes and progress toward policy goals. A major component of the MIDD 2 Framework is the creation of four MIDD strategy area.s that echo the continuum of behavioral health care and services and include a vital system support area. Each proposed MIDD 2 initiative is included in one of the four MIDD 2 strategy Areas. Each of the framework's four strategy areas includes sample performance measures for individuals along with outcomes and indicators forthe wider population. They are noted as \"sample\" because they represent examples of the tvpes of information to be sought in evaluation of MIDD 2 strategy areas and programming. lndicators reflected in the framework will change based on final MIDD 2 programming decisions and community and stakeholder feedback. Subsequent updates to the MIDD 2 Framework will be shared with the MIDD oversight committee for their review and feedback. As discussed in the MIDD Renewal Progress Report that was submitted to the Council in November 20L5, and the Comprehensive Historical Review and Assessment Report submitted to the Council in June 2016, King County Behavioral Health and Recovery Division, in consultation with the MIDD Oversight Committee, developed the MIDD 2 Framework as a tool to succinctly summarize the MIDD 2 approach, activities, policies and outcomes. Updates to the MIDD 2 Framework have been made based on stakeholder input and further clarifying the intent of sections that address potential performance measu res. The MIDD 2 Framework is a living document that will be further updated over the life of the MIDD 2 to reflect specific programmatic and services once they are determined by the Executive and Council in 2016. The Framework will continue to be updated over the life of MIDD 2 as a companion to the MIDD policy goals.Prevention and Early lnterventionPeople get the help they need to stoy heotthy ond keep problems from escalating Crisis DiversionPeople who are in crisis get the help they need to avoid unnecessory hospito I izotion OR i nco rce ratio n Recovery and ReentryPeople become healthy ond safely reintegrate to community ofter crisis System lmprovementsStrengthen the behoviorol health system to become more accessible ond deliver on outcomes 36 lPagea a1 8406 lV. Proposed MIDD 2lnitiatives MIDD 2 planning work was carefully conducted in clear and straightforward ways. From establishing the MIDD 2 Framework that simply and explicitly explains the purpose and outcomes of MIDD, to developing the review and renewal processes that prioritized the voices of communities, every step of the process that has resulted in the recommendations proposed in this Service lmprovement Plan has been transparently shared with stakeholders. The terms \"initiative\" and \"MIDD initiative\" describe individual programs and services supported by the MIDD sales tax. The Proposed MIDD 2 initiatives prioritize: r Funding services and programs to keep people out of or returning to jail and the criminal justice system, including upstream prevention and diversion activities. lnvesting in a treatment on demand system that dellvers treatment to people who need it, when they need it, so crises can be avoided or shortened. Creating community driven grants so geographic and culturally diverse communities can customize behavioral health services for their unique needs. Aligning MIDD 2 and Best Starts for Kids (BSK) has been a primary focus of DCHS. From holding joint Community Conversations, to collaborating on strategies and initiatives, to jointly reviewing MIDD 2 concepts and briefing papers, MIDD 2 planning and recommendations development has been a synergistic endeavor with BSK, This strong partnership will continue throughout the life of each of these initiatives, through planned joint meetings of the MIDD Oversight Committee and the Children and Youth Advisory Board and shared approaches to accomplishing the work of each initiative. Operationally, MIDD 2 and BSK are working to coordinate approaches to evaluation, contracting and reporting among other aspects. As a result of this collaboration, BSK is proposed to support an estimated $2.9 million (annually) for prevention-based behavioral health services for children and youth. This includes expanding screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment (SBIRT) into middle schools across the county along with an infant mental health program. Leveraging Medicaid to a greater extent is an underlying consideration of the proposed MIDD 2, with some MIDD funding replaced by expected Medicaid dollars. BHRD has concluded that King County and its partner providers can better leverage Medicaid funds, and in doing so, free up MIDD funds for other uses. The proposed MIDD 2 recommendations assume an estimated S3.4 million in Medicaid funds replace MIDD revenue. These assumptions impact not only providers, but also BHRD as well. BHRD is developing technical assistance and support for providers to ensure that they have the tools, training 3TlPage1 8406 and support to process Medicaid billing. Because getting the Medicaid assumptions accurate is critically important, BHRD engaged a consulting firm to analyze the Medicaid assumptions. Successful MIDD 1 programs are proposed to continue into MIDD 2, though some are merged or will be retooled during the implementation planning or request for proposal (RFP) process. Existing MIDD programs received strong support from stakeholders; those programs that were initially slated for marginal reductions launched effective public comment campaigns to restore funds. Twenty one new proposed initiatives are recommended for MIDD 2, bringing the total number of initiatives to 52. Please note that most newly proposed initiatives, along with existing MIDD 1 initiatives, have other sources of support. Very few MIDD L or MIDD 2 initiatives are solely supported by MIDD funds. The following are the new initiatives included in the proposed MIDD 2 funding and programmatic allocations, l-. Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) 2. South County Crisis Diversion 3. Alternatives to lncarceration for Youth 4. Family lntervention Restorative Services (FIRS) 5. Community Driven Behavioral Health Grants 6. Behavioral Health Services in Rural King County 7. Multipronged Opioid Response 8. Behavioral Health Urgent Care Walk ln 9. Mental Health First Aid L0. Zero Suicide Pilot Ll-. Recovery Caf\u00e9 12, Peer Bridgers/Peer Support 13, Rapid Rehousing-Oxford House Model L4. Emerging lssues lnitiative L5. Youth and Young Adult Homelessness Services 1-6. Young Adult Crisis Facility L7. Jail-Based Substance Use DisorderTreatment L8. Deputy Prosecuting Attorney for Familiar Faces 19. lnvoluntary Treatment Triage Pilot 20. Behavioral Health Risk Assessment Toolfor Adult Detention ln addition to these items, one time funds to study the concept of creating a new therapeutic court called \"community court\" is included in the Executive's proposed use of MIDD funds. Please see Appendix H, lnitiative Descriptions and Appendix M, Spending Plan for detailed funding and programmatic recommendations. Therapeutic courts32 are proposed to be fully supported by MIDD due to the continued constriction of the County's General Fund. While expanding treatment courts was included under MIDD, treatment 32 King County's Therapeutic courts are: Adult Drug Court, Juvenile Drug Court, Family Treatment Court, and Regional Mental Health Court. 33lPage1 8406 courts were funded by MIDD as authorized by supplantation33 starting in 2009. State law was modified to enable sales tax revenue to be used to support the cost of the judicial officer and support staff of a therapeutic court without being considered as supplantation. The MIDD 2 funding and programmatic proposal includes a recommended expansion of the Family Treatment Court to south King County due to demand. No other expansions of the courts are recommended, due in large part to strong and consistent feedback from stakeholders who were not supportive of expanding \"deep end\" criminaljustice costs. The MIDD resource is finite, and while the MIDD Fund has benefitted from a robust regionaleconomy experiencing increasing projected sales tax growth, not allof the suggested MIDD 2 concepts were able to be funded, despite increased revenue, The MIDD's new concept process yielded about $L80 million in requests for the estimated 5Sg m\u00a1ll\u00a1on of available MIDD funds. The collaboratively designed MIDD 2 review and renewal process balanced the needs for objectivity, analysis, transparency and community feedback. While most of the feedback on the MIDD review and renewal process has been positive, as with any process where funding recommendations are involved, there has been some expected frustration afticulated. The dissatisfaction with the process has largely been from entities whose particular suggestions were not recommended for funding or were recommended to be funded at a lower level. A survey of the MIDD 2 review and renewal process will occur in early 2OL7 to inform future similar endeavors. Economic Adjustments for Providers are included in MIDD 2 to be funded by fund balance as recommended in the MIDD Fund Financial Policies section on page 44. This is a major difference between MIDD 2 and MIDD 1, as MIDD L did not provide for adjustments to allocations based on inflation. ln most years, but not all, county agencies operating MIDD programs received inflationary adjustments while community providers did not. Consequently, partner agencies have been managing the erosion of MIDD funds while being expected to provide a constant level of services, resulting in provider subsidy of MIDD programs. MIDD 2 seeks to address this inequity by providing economic adjustments to providers. Should future MIDD 2 revenues decline, the county will need to explore the impact of continued economic adjustments on the MIDD 2 services and initiatives. Supporting and improvingthe behavioral health system is a vital component of the proposed MIDD 2 funding and programmatic recommendations. As discussed in an earlier section of this report the community behavioral health workforce is in crisis. These challenges negatively impact the publicly- funded behavioral health care system when trained, licensed and qualified staff are difficult to find and/or retain in community provider organizations, Without the people qualified to provide the services, the system is crippled. The proposed MIDD 2 funding and programmatic recommendations maintains the important MIDD L initiative, Workload Reduction (formerly \"Caseload Reduction\") and expands the Workforce Development initiative (formerly \"Chemical Dependency Professional Education and Training\"). While maintained and expanded respectively, each of these initiatives is planned to be 33 See page l-6 for a discussion of supplantation and MIDD 39 lPage1 8406 revised and restructured in 2017 in part due to the integration of substance use and mental health services. MIDD Operations and Management As with MIDD L, DCHS will continue to have overall responsibility for the management and implementation of MIDD 2, including managing the budget; behavioral health systems and programmatic development; oversight of the request for proposal (RFP), memorandum of agreement (MOU), and contracting processes; and evaluation of MIDD, The great majority of services provided through the MIDD will be contracted out to community agencies, though not all MIDD initiatives will be subject to an RFP process. For example, MIDD l- services that are provided under an MOU with another King County department and will continue into MIDD 2 will not be RFPd, (but will have a revised MOU). MIDD 2 will use the same approach used for MIDD j_ to determine whether proposed MIDD 2 initiatives will engage in a competitive RFp process. please see Appendix G for the decision model BHRD will continue to use to determine the need for competitive procurement. Because of MIDD and BHRD's commitment to eguity and social justice and community engagement, many of the initiatives proposed in the MIDD 2 funding and programmatic recommendations (both new and existing under MIDD 1-) will involve intentional partnering with communities, particularly around services and RFP development. For example, the revisions needed for the Workload Reduction initiative to include substance use providers will be developed with a workgroup of providers and other stakeholders, A new initiative such as the Youth Behavioral Health Alternatives to Secure Detention requires deliberate and planned community engagement to ensure that the determined approach is truly responsive to community needs. Not only does MIDD 2 propose funding and programmatic recommendations, the next iteration of MIDD will include a number of internal operating and process improvements designed to enhance transparency, streamline processes, promote collaboration, share information, and make progress on overcoming challenges. 40 lPage1 8406 V. Responses to Ordinance L7998 Ordinance 17998 called for the MIDD 2 Service lmprovement Plan (SlP) to be submitted to the King County Council in December 20t6. ln order to support the King County Council's desire for expanded review and input of the MIDD 2 SlP, the SIP report called for by Ordinance 17998 is submitted three months eorlier thon required. One impact of this changed timeline is that two elements of the MIDD 2 SIP called for by Ordinance 17998 -lmplementation3a and Evaluation information3s -- are included aT high levels in this SlP. This is due to the fact that these two elements require further development that needs to occur in collaboration with the MIDD Oversight Committee and providers. The shortened time line impacted BHRD's ability to conduct thoughtful implementation planning in partnership with providers and others. During the Briefing Paper Review Panels, a number of themes around implementation of MIDD 2 were articulated repeatedly by dozens of community members who participated. Thoughtful implementation planning must: 1,. lnvolve communities and consumers in a meaningful and intentional way 2. Recognize That how services are provided is critical for success, particularly for ethnic and cultural communities and populations served 3. Put the consumer, not systems, at the center of decisions. Developing a MIDD 2 lmplementation Plan requires the County to collaborate with providers, consumers and communities which takes time and resources, Additionally, policy goals that were established for MIDD 1 were recommended to be revised as per the MIDD Comprehensive Historical Assessment Report, and have not been reviewed, discussed, amended or finalized by the Council. The MIDD L policy goals played a major role in developing implementation and evaluation outcomes; they are foundational to the entire MIDD L evaluation approach. Having MIDD 2 policy goals will enable the county to efficiently and effectively develop meaningful, collaborative implementation and evaluation plans. Finally, adoption of the King County 201-7-20L8 biennial budget in mid-November will have a significant impact on the final programmatic and funding array for the MIDD 2 and final budgetary decisions which would need to be reflected in the MIDD 2 lmplementation and Evaluation Plans. It is therefore the recommendation of the Executive that the MIDD 2 lmplementation and Evaluation Plans be submitted in mid-201-7 for review and acceptance by the Council. This approach is similar to the sequencing of MIDD L lmplementation and Evaluation plans. This timeline allows for BHRD to conduct an intentional implementation and evaluation planning process in collaboration with communities, consumers and the MIDD Oversight Committee; align with BSK and other county endeavors; and thoughtfully enact recommendations related to MIDD evaluation contained in the Comprehensive 3a ordinance 17998, Historica Assessment Report.

Please note that in most instances, information for the proposed MIDD 2 initiatives is very preliminary due to the need to conduct detailed implementation planning in collaboration with stakeholders and communities. Additionally, most existing MIDD 1 initiatives that are recommended to continue into MIDD 2 will also undergo some form of operational updating to increase efficiency, effectiveness and meet revised policy goals. All initiatives will be included and detailed in a MIDD 2 lmplementation Plan that is recommended to be submitted to the Council in 2OLl. The sections below detail the specific recommendations called for by Ordinance L7998. ln some instances, the recommendations may require legislation; these items are indicated by an asterisk (*) in the summary table associated with each area. The spending plan (Attachment M) reflects the four strategy areas of the MIDD Framework (Prevention and Early lntervention, Crisis Diversion, Recovery and Reentry and System lmprovements).36Therapeutic courts and MIDD administration and evaluation are included as separate categories so thatthose important costs can be seen and tracked separately. Finally, in keeping with the established process and timeline for the development of the Mental lllness and Drug Dependency Service lmprovement Plan, this document reflects Executive priorities for the programming and funding of Mental lllness and Drug Dependency revenues. ln addition to including Executive priorities for the spending of MIDD revenue, adjustments to certain proposed MIDD initiatives have occurred due to one or more of the following factors: 1. Updated Office of FinancialAnalysis (OEFA) MIDD sales tax projections 2. Revised Medicaid assumptions 3. Staged implementation assumptions of select initiatives. Learning from the experience of MIDD L, the County recognizes that it is not always possible to begin spending on a MIDD initiative, program or service as soon as budget authority is granted. Requests for Proposals, Qualifications or lnformation (RFP, RFO\" RFI) are often needed, and communities and stakeholders may wish to be involved in developing the details of services and or locations, all of which take time to thoughtfully address. Given the fact that some new initiatives require time to launch, the spending plan (Attachment M) assumes the staged implementation of some new initiatives. Staged implementation of initiatives allows for the efficient deployment of unspent funds for other needs such as addressing the revised Medicaid assumptions, building of the Rainy Day Reserve and funding other identified priorities. Please see Appendix H, lnitiative Descriptions and Appendix M, Spending Plan for detailed funding and progra mmatic recom mendations. 36 The MIDDFramework is described on page 35. 43 lPage1 8406 MIDD Fund Financial Policies Recommendations Reserve Policies: ln 2o07 when the MIDD 1 Fund was created, a Rate Stabilization Reserve3T of 5.25% of expected revenues was established. Since then, the County has refined and standardized its reserve policies (Motion 1411,0). Page 2L of the Comprehensive Financial Management policies38 states, ,,the majority of operating funds, including Enterprise Funds and Special Revenue Funds, should maintain a Rainy Day Reserve equal to 30-60 days of expenditures.,, ln consultation with PSB, \u00a1t is recommended that the MIDD fund establish a reserve policy of 60 days of expenditure. PSB's reserve analysis concluded that revisingthe MIDD Fund's reserve policyto 60 days of expenditure would ensure the reserve is adequate to mitigate the volatility of sales tax collections, This would also bring the MIDD fund's reserve into alignment w\u00a1th current County policies. The effect of this recommendation will be an increase in the level of reserves Rainy Day Reserve: ln order to achieve the level of reserves that the 60 day policy calls for, it is recommended that funds be allocated to the Rainy Day Reserve to fund the reserve within the current biennium' The County may elect to allocate additional funds to the reserve when feasible. As a result of the 2008 economic downturn, MIDD 1 was forced to cut funding to strategies, services and programs due to deeply reduced sales tax revenue. Establishing and maintaining the Rainy Day Reserve will help the county preserve services as long as possible during the next economic decline, Use of Undesignated Fund Balance: When required financial reserves are fully funded, any remaining 37 These reserves set aside fund balance to minimize rate, fee or revenue increases needed in future years to provide the current level of service, For example, a fund that is primarily funded through central rate allocations can fund a rate stabilization reserve with excess contribut\u00a1ons or with underexpenditures in order to limit the annual increases to inflation pluspopulation growth. source: King county Fund Balonce Reserve and contingency 38 http://www.kingcounty.gov /-/media/exec/PSB/documents/CompFinMngmtpoliciesDoc.ashx?la=enOrdina,nce Component stPRecommendations Recommend MIDD fund bolance policies for the fund, toking into considerotion the county's existing fund balqnce ond reserve policies (tines 170-17L)1. Revise MIDD Fund reserve policy to be 60 days of expenditure, placed in a reserve titled ,,Rainy Day Reserve.\" 2. Allocate funds to the Rainy Day Reserve to fully fund the reserve within the current biennium. 3. When reserve levels are met, prioritize use of MIDD funding as follows: A. Allocate funds for provider economic adjustments for the next biennium. B. Reserve funds for the Emerging lssues initiative to S650,000 annually 44lPage1 8406 fund balance is considered \"undesignated fund balance.\" Undesignated fund balance can be utilized and generated when the MIDD Fund has under expended budget and/or collected higherthan planned for revenue. When an undesignated fund balance exists for the MIDD fund, it is recommended that the funds be allocated in the following order: L Allocate funds for provider economic adjustments for following biennia. This ensures future adjustments can occur without reducing services or funding for existing initiatives; 2. Allocate funds to the Emerging lssues initiative to $650,000 Over the course of MIDD 1-, the MIDD Oversight Committee utilized subcommittees and work groups to inform its financial recommendations to the Council and Executive. Most recently in 201-5 and in 2016, the MIDD Oversight Committee created an ad hoc work group to generate recommendations for potential use of MIDD fund balance for the Council and Executive to consider during supplemental budget processes. lt is recommended that the county continue to utilize MIDD Advisory Committee3e workgroups/subcommittees when fund balance remains after applying it as outlined above.a0 Adding, Deleting or Modifying MIDD lnitiatives, Strategies, Services and Programs The MIDD 2 initiative revision processes outlined below will ensure that revisions of MIDD-funded initiatives, strategies, services and programs are communicated clearlyto MIDD providers, policymakers and the MIDD Oversight Committee. The processes also specify how and when the MIDD Oversight Committee is to be engaged in recommended changes. The modifications to the MIDD l strategy revision process, along with other improvements to the operations of the MIDD Oversight Committee, provide the means to transparently share information and develop recommendations regarding changes or additions to MIDD initiatives, strategies, services and programs. 3s Proposed legislation to revise the name of the MIDD Oversight Committee to the MIDD Advisory Commlttee has been transmitted to the King County Council. Therefore, the term \"MIDD Advisory Committee\" is used in this document when referencing potentlal prospective acts by the current MIDD Oversight Comm\u00a1ttee, assuming King County Council approval of legislation that formally changes the name of the Committee from \"Oversight\" to \"Advisory\". A discussion of the proposed name change occurs on page 60 of th\u00a1s document. a0 In general, the charge of the tund Balance work groups/subcommittees is to develop recommendations on the use of the fvllDD fund's undesignated fund balance. ln turn, the FBWG recommendations are considered, approved, amended or rejected bythe MIDD Oversight Committee. Approved recommendations are subsequentlyforwarded to the King County Executive and Council for potential inclusion in 2016 budget supplementals.ldentified processes ond procedures to odd, delete or modify MIDD strategies, services and programs, including specifying how and when the MIDD oversight committee is to be engoged in the recommendations (lines L67-169)L Use updated MIDD 1 revision processes for modifying or adjusting MIDD initiatives, strategies, services and programs. 2. Utilize Emerging lssues initiative to support emerging services and programs for up to two years. 45 lPage1 8406 MIDD 1 Strategy Modification Process: ln March of 2009, a process to modify strategies, services and programs was established for MIDD L. lt was reviewed and discussed by the MIDD Oversight Committee in March 2009. The process outlined when revisions were to be brought before the oversight Committee for review and discussion and when revisions could occur at the discretion of the division. Three thresholds were identified that triggered when strategy revisions were to be brought to the MIDD Oversight Committee for consultation, review and comment. They were:. A proposed change of funding of 15 percent or more. A proposed elimination of a strategy ' Changes to provider resources/processes/funding methodology/FTE/RFP or contract processes. When one of the thresholds was met, the suggested revision was brought to the Oversight Committee to conduct a review of the request, For example, in 20LL, expansion of the Regional Mental Health Court under Strategy l-Lb was brought to the OC to create a pilot program for Veterans. ln 2012, the revisioning of Strategy l\"f Parent Partners Family Assistance underwent Oversight Committee review, as well as changing services at Adult Drug Court (Strategy 15a) from young adult wraparound to transitional housing resources. The Committee's review included analysis and vetting of the requested changes and taking public comment. lf approved by the MIDD Oversight Committee, the change was made and was reflected in the MIDD annual reports. ln the instances when the threshold criteria for MIDD Oversight Committee review were not met (i.e., the change was less than 1-5 percent in funding, a strategy was not eliminated, nor a change to resources, processes, FTE, etc.), the change was made and reflected in the annual and quarterly reports. This process was used frequently in the first few years of MIDD 1- as strategies were evolving. For example, in 201\"0, a project with the University Of Washington School Of Social Work was piloted to allow students pursuing Masters' degrees to jointly earn their chemical dependency professional certificate' over time, as strategies matured, fewer modifications were required, and the process for modifying strategies was used less. Each annual report continues to include strategy revisions. Recommended MIDD 2 Processes for Modifying lnitiatives, Strategies, Services and programs: Building on the MIDD l revision approach, MIDD 2 will use the same approach to revisions process with some modification to one of the thresholds for clarity. The third type of threshold modification that would trigger a review by the MIDD Advisory committee will be revised as shown below. MIDD Strategy Revision Process 1. A proposed change of funding of L5 percent or more (increase or decrease)No Change 2. A proposed elimination of a strategy No Change 3. Changes to provider resou rces/processes/fund ing methodology /FfE/ RFP or contract processesChanges to Population served Outcomes or results lntervention Performance measures 46 lPage1 8406 Revisions to MIDD 2 initiatives, strategies, services and programs will be brought to the MIDD Advisory Committee for consultation, review and comment when revisions meet one of three thresholds: . A proposed change of funding of L5 percent or more (increase or decrease) . A proposed elimination of a strategy \u00a1 Changes to: o Population served o Outcomes or results o lnterve ntion o Performance measures. Similar to the revision process for MIDD L, in the instances when the threshold criteria for MIDD Oversight Committee review are not met in MIDD 2 (i.e., the changewas less than 15 percent in funding, a strategy was not eliminated, nor changes to population served, intervention, outcomes, performance measures, etc.), the change will be made and reflected in the annual reports. Please see Appendix lfor the MIDD 2 lnitiative Revisions Process Flow Chart, ln addition to the formalized process above, BHRD staff will provide regular updates on all changes to MIDD 2 initiatives to the MIDD Advisory Committee at least two times per year at Advisory Committee meetings, Additionally, BHRD staff and leadership will receive trainings on the revision process to ensure it is used appropriately. New MIDD lnitiatives: Given that MIDD is a limited resource that is proposed to be fully programmed, including the allocation of fund balances to reserves, it is not recommended that new, ongoing initiatives, strategies, services and programs be added to the MIDD during the biennium. Should it be determined by BHRD and PSB that MIDD revenues greatly outpace projections for a sustained period, and that economic adjustments can continue for existing initiative providers, BHRD in collaboration with the MIDD Advisory Committee, may elect to initiate a new initiative process. Such a process would follow a similar approach and methodology to the MIDD L Fund Balance Work Group (FBWG) and MIDD 2 New Concepts processes. The MIDD 1 FBWG, comprised of MIDD Oversight Committee members and county staff, reviewed financial and programmatic information and made recommendations to the Oversight Committee regarding services and funding, The New Concepts process for MIDD 2 was a structured, time-limited invitation to suggest new ideas for MIDD 2 funding. Emerging lssues: MIDD 2 is proposed to include an Emerging lssues initiative whereby certain developing programs or services can seek to be funded for up to two years by the MIDD 2. As was done for certain MIDD l strategies, it is recommended that the MIDD Advisory Committee, in partnership with BHRD, develop criteria and processes for recommending to the Executive and the Council how to utilize Emerging lssues funds. Among other criteria to be included: care \u00a1 Based on best or promising practices 4TlPageThe section below details the Emerging lssues approach1 8406 \u00a1 Reflects a recovery oriented system of care\u00a1 Demonstrates financial sustainability outside of MIDD revenues. Emerging lssues lnitiative & protocols The MIDD initiative revision processes outlined above specify how revisions to MIDD funded initiatives, strategies, services and programs occur and how and when the MIDD Advisory Committee is to be engaged in recommended changes. This section outlines protocols for utilization of the recommended Emerging lssues initiative of MtDD 2, The Emerging lssues initiative provides a flexible source of MIDD funds for certain items to be funded for a shortterm. The Emerging lssues initiative is not intended to be used as an ongoing source of funds for new MIDD 2 initiatives, programs or services, because MIDD is a limited resource that is fully programmed, including the programming of fund balances. As noted, MIDD is a limited resource that is proposed to be fully programmed, including the allocation of fund balances to reserves. Following the recommendation outlined above for new initiatives, no new, ongoing initiatives, strategies, services and programs should be added to the MIDD during the biennium, including services and programs supported by Emerging lssues funding to be added to the MIDD. Shouldit be determined by BHRD and PSB that MIDD revenues greatly outpace projections for a sustained period, and that economic adjustments can continue for existing initiative providers, BHRD in collaboration with the MIDD Advisory Committee, may elect to initiate a new initiative process. Such a process would follow a similar approach and methodology to the MIDD i. Fund Balance Work Group (FBWG) and MIDD 2 New Concepts process\u20acs;al The Emerging lssues initiative is modeled in part on the New Strategy reserve that was established early in MIDD l- via ordinance I626L. The purpose of the reserve was to support new strategies not provided for in the then current MIDD plan that would meet the established policy goals. ordinance 1626L stated, The council recognizes thot the needs of the county's residents may chonge over time ond thot new and innovative mentol health, substonce abuse ond therapeutic court progroms ond services ore continually being developed ond implemented ocross the country. Therefore, it is the policy of the county thqt the county's mental illness ond drug dependency shall maintain flexibility to respond to the changing needs of the county,s population os well os to occommodote new mental health, substance obuse and theropeutic court strategies ond progroms.a2 ordinance 16261 tasked the MIDD Oversight Committee with proposing a new strategies process and schedule. The new strategies process approach was reviewed at the February 2009 MIDD Oversight Committee meeting and was included in the subsequent MIDD Annual Report that was transmitted to a1 See page 31 for details of the Three phased Renewal process. a2 Ordinance 16261, lines 68-74 43lPage1 8406 the Council. The new strategy process was never launched due to the economic downturn. MIDD strategies were reduced when sales tax revenues declined sharply. Emerging lssues Policies and Protocols: The following outl\u00a1ne the key components of the proposed MIDD Emerging lssues initiative.a3 A. Emerging lssues funds are one time funds for one to two years. Emerging lssues funds would not be provided in an ongoing fashion for the concepts. B. The Emerging lssues initiative funds would be appropriated periodically during the biennial budget period. C. BHRD and the MIDD Advisory Committee would review requests for Emerging lssues funds, recommending to the Executive items to be funded from the Emerging lssues initiative, similar to the existing Fund Balance work group/subcommittee approach. D. Emerging lssues schedule would be established so that at least once a year Emerging lssues requests would be considered by the MIDD Advisory Committee. E. How and whether programs supported by Emerging lssues funds are evaluated will be included in the MIDD 2 evaluation framework that is planned to be transmitted to the Council in 20L7. F. A MIDD Advisory Committee workgroup will be established to develop and review criteria and operational details of the Emerging lssues initiative in collaboration with BHRD staff. The proposed MIDD Emerging lssues initiative recognizes that unexpected behavioral health needs in King County occur. lt positions MIDD funds to be deployed in a targeted way to address such issues, The policies and protocols for the proposed Emerging lssues initiative provide a thoughtful and transparent approach to accessing the funds that include MIDD Advisory Committee expert review and recommendation for consideration by the Executive and Council. Proposed Schedule for Reporting a3 Because the Emerging lssues ln\u00a1tiatlve process and timeline will be devetoped in partnership with the MIDD Advisory Committee, an lnitiative Description is not included in Appendix H. lt will be detailed in the forthcoming MIDD lmplementation Pla n. 49 lPageOrdinance Component A proposed schedule for reporting to the council, ot least annuolly, on progress ond performance of the MIDD funded strotegies, services and programs (lines 13L-133)1..Revise datacollection periods to January to January fiscal/calendar year. * 2, Revise annual report due date to the Council to August.* 3. Launch web data dashboard1 8406 Reporting on the progress of MIDD toward meeting the established policy goals is a vital aspect of MIDD that must continue with MIDD 2. Reporting is the chief mechanism to share the growth and evolution of MIDD or highlight its challenges. The recommendations included in this section are based on internal and external stakeholder feedback and are intended to streamline and make more efficient the reporting processes for providers and the county. Recommendations L and 2 are linked, as explained below, and intended to be enacted together, 1. One annual report transm\u00a1tted to the Council in August: Ordinance 1-5949 established the annual report due date to the King County Council as April l- each year. Moving the due date to August enables the following recommendation to move forward. Another key element of this recommendation is based in feedback from the Oversight Committee regarding its review of the MIDD evaluation reports. Some members expressed a desire to spend more time in meaningful review and discussion of the report and its data before it is finalized for transmittal to the Council. ln order to accommodate this request, additional time is needed for the Committee to conduct its review. 2. Revise data collection periods to January to January fiscal/calendar year. The current data collection period for MIDD 1- strategies is October L-September30 each year, with the MIDD annual report due to the Council on April 1,44 The MIDD 1 data collection timeline was established to enable the preparation and analysis of data to meet the April 1- timeline. As experienced over eight years of MIDD L evaluation work, it requires several months to gather, clean, prepare and analyze data for MIDD evaluations. This is due in part to the sheer quantity of data, in part due to the quality of data, and in part to the methodology that providers use to submit their data.a5 Changing the data collection period would align the MIDD data collection cycles with other entities' (local, state, federal, philanthropic) for providers, making it easier and more efficient for them to provide data. lt would necessitate a revised due date for the annual report, as recommended above to be August. 3.

Recommended Modifications to the MIDD Oversight Committee *ltems morked with \"*\" require legislotive action to chonge. Background: ln April 2008 the King County Council adopted Ordinance 16077 which established the MIDD Oversight Committee and identified the role of the Committee as an advisory body to the King County Executive and the Council. Ordinance L6077 states, The purpose of the oversight committee is to ensure that the implementotion and evoluotion of the strategies ond progroms funded by the tox revenue are tronsporent, accountoble and colloborotive.

Please see Appendix B for a list of MIDD Oversight Committee members as of June 2016. Recommendations: Most of the recommendations included in this section were generated by Oversight Committee members during committee meetings where specific feedback on role and composition was sought, during other meetings, or through 1-on-1 interviews. Some components of the recommendations were generated from community engagement activities or other feedback mechanisms used by the county during MIDD renewal work. These recommendations were reviewed and revised by the Oversight Committee and/or the Oversight Committee's Strategy Team. Details of the recommendations for the role and composition of the MIDD Oversight Committee are described below. Maintain role as advisory body to the Executive and Council. The members of MIDD Oversight Committee provide essential advice and input to King County policymakers on matters involving the MIDD. Each member brings their individual and systems wide experience and knowledge to the MIDD Oversight Committee table to inform discussions and develop recommendations for policymakers. This crucial role is proposed to continue into MIDD 2. The Advisory Committee should continue to promote coordination and collaboration between entities involved with MIDD programs; educate the public, policymakers and stakeholders on sales tax funded programs; and coordinate and share information with other related efforts and groups. While the ordinance-established role of the Advisory Committee is not proposed to be changed, how lhe Advisory Committee functions and what else it can occomplish within its role and with its unique array of leaders from the behavioral health, physical health and criminaljustice systems will evolve with MIDD 2. Based on strong feedback from Oversight Committee members, particularly those who participated in the MIDD 2 planning work on MIDD 2 Briefing Paper Review Panels, the Advisory Committee is envisioned to leverage its position to move systems forward and collaboratively resolve issues. System stakeholders can utilize MIDD to work collectivelyto explore and align solutions to complex problems. Specific areas and tasks that the Advisory Committee will engage on during MIDD 2 include: o Engaging in intentional and deep systems discussions that inform, initiate, innovate and enhance outcomes for those served \u00a1 Creating a \"well connectedness\" of systems . Emphasizing community engagement and two-way information sharing o Building trust and credibility, particularly in communities of color or other marginalized communities o Developing a deeper understanding of MIDD 2 initiatives, data and evaluation approaches. 53 lPage1 8406 Other operational improvements related to the MIDD Advisory Committee are outlined at the end of this section. Revise membership to reflect changed organizations, boards or entities. Since its inception in 2008, some of the various entities named in the Oversight Committee's organizing ordinance have evolved and changed. The following revisions are recommended to the composition of the MIDD oversight committee along with the basis for the recommended change. MIDD Oversight Committee SeatRecommend Revision to MIDD Advisory CornrnitteeBasis of Change aTwo Seats for King County Behavioral Health BoardConsolidate 2 Behavioral Health Board seats into one MIDD Oversight Net change: -LOn April 'J\",2016, King County's mental health and substance use disorder services systems were integrated into one seamless, managed care treatment system as required by state legislation (2SSB 6312). The formerly separate King County Mental Health Advisory Board and the King County Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Administrative Board were merged into one Behavioral Health and Recovery Board.a8 A representative from a public defender agency that the county contracts with to provide servicesEliminate seat for this entity; Public Defense is represented by existing Office of Public Defense seat Net change: -Lln 201,3, King County established the Department of Public Defense (DpD) as a charter-created department within county government and transitioned from a public defense system in which the county contracted with four defender organizations to provide defense services. Defense services are provided by DPD and the county no longer holds contracts with defender agencies. These changes result in the opportunity to repurpose two of the 30 MIDD Oversight Committee seats as recommended below. While some input was received suggesting that the number of King County government seats on the committee be reduced, it is important to recognize that each King County government seat represents a key system element. Thus, maintaining the 11 King County government seats ensures the necessary representation to conduct intentional and deep systems discussions that inform, initiate, innovate and enhance outcomes forthose served, creating a \"well connectedness\" of systems that was also called for by community input. other input stated that no specific King County government member should be eliminated, but that \"equalizing\" was needed. Please note that just over one third of the committee a8 Ord\u00a1nance 1'8170 passed in 2015 amended the MIDD Oversight Committee to include two members of the Behavioral Health Board rather than one seat for the eliminated Mental Health Advisory Board and the Alcohol and Substance Abuse Administrative Board; the number of seats were not amended. 54 lPage1 8406 seats are King County government seats (L1\" out of 30); with the addition of more seats, the ratio of community to government seats would be even greater than the current 2:L community to government seats. Among the changes proposed to be made to the MIDD Oversight Committee are technical changes that reflect organizational name changes by member organizations that in turn require updating the King County Code established member list including: . Suburban Cities Association is now Sound Cities Association r Committee to End Homelessness is now All Home . Office of the public defender is now Department of Public Defense Add five new seats to the Committee. Throughout the course of MIDD 2 planning, Oversight Committee members recognized and articulated the need to have additional perspectives represented on the committee. From the Committee's establishment of Values and Guiding Principles in March 2015 to its explicit feedback on the roles and composition of the committee in January and March of 20t6, members have been exceedingly clear about the need to have MIDD 2 intentionally informed by the voices and experiences of consumers, youth, immigrants and refugees, the faith community, and specific cultural populations. The recommended additions to the MIDD Oversight Committee are also driven by the County's Equity and SocialJustice Agenda which finds that race, place and income impact quality of life for residents of King County and people of color, and those who have limited English proficiency and/or low-incomes persistently face inequities in key educational, economic and health outcomes. These inequities are driven by an array of factors including the tax system, unequal access to the determinants of equity,as subtle but pervasive individual bias, and institutional and structural racism and sexism. These factors, while invisible to some, have profound and tangible impacts for others, particularly those who also may be living with behavioral health conditions and experiencing criminaljustice involvement. With this in mind and based on the guidance of the MIDD Oversight Committee, the county recommends the following entities be added to the MIDD Advisory Committee. Recommended Additional Seats to MIDD Advisory Committee \u00a1lation Specific Entity Consumers & Communities- 2 RepresentotivesFrom Consumers and Communities Ad Hoc Work Group Recovery Washington Recovery Allia nce Education Puget Sound Educational Services District Philanthropy Many inds http://www. 55 lPage1 8406 Monaged Care Medicaid Managed Care Plans G ra s sroots Org a n i zoti o n Representing Cultural Populotion(s)To be determined Each of the recommended additions to the composition of the MIDD Advisory Committee is intended to enrich and deepen the advice and guidance provided by the Committee to the King County Executive and Council. The added seats expand the expertise around the table and strengthen system connections. The following details the basis of the recommended additions. A. Convene Consumers and Communities Ad Hoc Work Group - 2 Representatives from Ad Hoc Work Group Appointed to MIDD Advisory Committee After much discussion with subject matter experts (including specific feedback during the community engagement process), individual MIDD Oversight Committee members, and building off of the learnings from recent efforts that included consumers and communities, the County recommends establishing a Consumers and Communities Ad Hoc Work Group of the MIDD Advisory Committee. The work group would be comprised of individuals with lived experience of the behavioral health system (consumers) and individuals who are a part of communities with marginalized identities or experiences, including but not limited to:o Transgender (Trans) r Youth \u00a1 Fa ith \u00a1 Previous justice system involvement r Peers. Consumer inclusion is called for in King County's adopted Recovery and Resiliency Oriented Behavioral Health Services Plan 2012-2017. This recommendation reflects several key principles of community engagement, including the \"nothing about us, without us\" concept, where the idea that no policy should be decided by any representative without the full and direct participation of members of the group(s) affected by that policy. lt further recognizes that no one person should be asked to speak for an entire population or experience, particularly in an environment where lay people are sharing decision- or recommendation-making platforms with those who have significant positional authority, such as elected officials. Given the number of communities identified as needing a voice in MIDD, and because there are many diverse lived experiences involved with behavioral health, an additional t2 up to a maximum 56 lPage1 8406 of 20 consumer and community positions to the MIDD Advisory Committee would be required. An Oversight Committee of 50 or more would not be feasible to operate as the Committee has operated, and more so given the operational improvements planned; therefore, the recommendation to convene a Consumers and Communities Ad Hoc Work Group balances the need to enable a greater number of experiences and perspectives to be brought forward to the Advisory Committee with efficiency and effectiveness of operation. One of the chief barriers to ongoing and meaningful consumer and community participation is the expectation that individuals will donate their time to participate and advise. Unlike separately elected or other city or county officials, or executive directors of behavioral health provider organizations whose jobs include participation with MIDD, community members'time has not been considered for compensation. A notable component of the Consumers and Communities Ad Hoc Work Group is that work group members will be reimbursed for expenses associated with their participation. This is reflective of the County and MIDD 2's commitment to enacting principles of equity and social justice. It is currently envisioned that the Ad Hoc Work Group will have between t2 and a maximum of20 members, with at least half to be people with lived experience as a consumer of behavioral health services. The Ad Hoc Work Group members will be given extra support and preparation to help them fulfill their duties. The charter of the work group, along with other processes including identifying members of the workgroup, will be developed by BHRD in collaboration with the MIDD Advisory Committee. lt is expected that the work group will begin meeting at the beginning of the second quarter of 20L7. Two Consumers and Communities Ad Hoc Work Group members would be recommended to serve as full members of the MIDD Advisory Committee, subject to the existing appointment and confirmation process. B. Recovery Recovery from mental health and/or substance use disorders is a process of change through which individuals improve their health and wellness, live a self-directed life, and strive to achieve their full potential.soThe process of recovery is highly personal and occurs via many pathways. lt may include clinicaltreatment, medications, faith-based approaches, peer support, family support, self-care, and other approaches. \"Fundamentally, recovery is not a practice; it is a culture. lt is not as much what you do, but how you do it. Recovery focuses on values and meaning more than on behaviors.\"sl ln 2013 Ordinance 17553, King County established that the principles of recovery are foundational to behavioral health services, thus adding a recovery seat to the MIDD Oversight Committee further enacts the vision of recovery as outlined in Ordinance 17553. Bringing the perspective of recovery to the MIDD Advisory Committee will further embed recovery into the work of the MIDD and help s0 https://www. mentalhealth. gov/basics/recovery/index. htm I sl King County Recovery and Resiliency Oriented Behavioral Health Services Plan201.2-2017, pg. 10; attachment A to Ordinance 17ss3 57 | Page1 8406 ensure that recommendations from the MIDD Advisory Committee are infused with recovery principles such as trauma-informed care. oversight Committee feedback stated that coalitions and alliances representing a group of entities should be considered when possible, rather than individual entities. This would enable broader involvement than one individual or ent\u00a1ty. ln keeping with that charge, it is recommended that the recovery seat be established for the Washington Recovery Alliance.s2 The Washington Recovery Alliance is a group of organizations and individual from across Washington State that educates, promotes and advocates for recovery issues. C. Educotion Bringing a representative of the education domain to the MIDD Advisory Committee provides another connection to children, youth and families served by MIDD and the other systems represented by MIDD Advisory Committee members. Early identification of social, emotional and behavioral problems in children often happen in schools. Schools are critical in linking youth and families with crisis support, respite care, case management, counseling and behavioral health interventions. Schools are directly connected to MIDD via prevention, intervention, treatment and crisis services, so creating a seat for the education domain is a natural evolution of MIDD. D. Philonthropy King County has become proficient at braiding funds to create a system of care; between state, federal and local resources a continuum of care from early intervention/prevention to crisis services has been created and is demonstrated through MIDD 2. Despite the County's best efforts, gaps remain. The philanthropic community has become an important community partner to advance the public behavioral health system. The Many Minds Collaborative is paftnering with King County to research, assess and document the public mental health landscape in King County. That work has grown into early catalytic investments in proven behavioral health programs. Their investments demonstrate commitment to improving the behavioral health system and rationale for participation in the MIDD Advisory Committee. E. Managed Care As King County is moving toward addressing the question of what form \"full\" integration of behavioral and physical health care will take, it is clear that whatever the answer, Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) operating in King County will have some kind of role. ln recognition of the future role that MCos may have with full integrations3, it is recommended that a seat on the Advisory Committee be held by the MCOs. Following the approach that the King County Accountable community of Health lnterim Leadership council outlined in its charter, Two people from different organizations may co-hold a seat, for purposes of assuring adequate sector representation and part\u00a1cipation in meetings. For Medicaid managed care plans, all plans under contract with the Washington Health Care Authority are invited to participate. ln cases where there is more than one representative from a sector, each sector would constitute one \"vote,, in s2 https://washingtonrecoveryallia nce.org s3 A more in-depth discussion of integration of behavioral and physical health care takes place on pages 66:69 oflhil r-eport. 53lPage1 8406 decision making.sa This recommendation was not uniformly supported by all members of the MIDD Strategy Team where it was reviewed and discussed priorto being included in this Service lmprovement Plan. Some MIDD Oversight Committee representatives on the Strategy Team articulated grave concerns about inviting the MCOs to participate on the Advisory Committee. Questions were raised regarding whether MCOs could serve individuals and communities most in need while being a for profit entity, Alternatively, some afticulated that involving MCOs in the deep systems discussions around behavioral health and the criminal justice systems could help them better understand the needs, populations and services touched by MIDD and the behavioral health system. ln the spirit of inclusivity and in order to further develop the behavioral health system across sectors, it was determined that the benefits of inviting the MCOs to the MIDD Advisory Committee are notable. Other suggestions for additional member seats were made over the course of the last year that are not included in these recommendations. The additional seats that are recommended to be included represent key system voices that bring a needed perspective to the Committee and its advisory role. lt is important to remember that holding a seat on the Advisory Committee is not the only way to participate with MIDD. All MIDD Advisory Committee meetings are open to the public and public comment will continue to be included in each meeting. lnitiate an Array of Operational lmprovements: ln collaboration with the MIDD Advisory Committee, BHRD is planning a number of operational improvements involving or related to the MIDD Advisory Committee. The majority of these activities are based on feedback and suggestions from Oversight Committee members, while some are based on lessons learned from staffing the MIDD Oversight Committee over time. They are intended to support the systems-spanning work requested by committee members to inform the review and recommendation functions of the MIDD Oversight Committee. sa http://www,kingcounty.gov/elected/executive/health-human-services- transformation /ach/-lmedia/exec/HHStransformation/ACH-Charter,ashx , page 4.Type of lmprovement Details 1.

Reflective of the established duties and functions of the Committee that are recommended to continue to MIDD 2, it is recommended that the name of the Committee be amended to reflect its duties as an advisory body:The MIDD Advisory Committee. Generally, an oversight body has the capacity to make final decisions or substantive decisions which the current committee does not. Rather, as an advisory body, the committee makes recommendations to the Executive and the Council. This change would clarify the role of the committee both to members and other stakeholders. Executive staff have consulted with the Prosecutor's Office on this matter and no potential legal issues were raised. Legislation to effectuate this, and other changes proposed for the Committee, has been transmitted to the King County Council for consideration, With the name change, the MIDD Advisory Committee is recommended to continue as an advisory body comprised of leaders who represent an array of systems, populations and experiences. lts membership is deliberately constructed to bring the knowledge, expertise and perspectives needed to review and provide input on the development, implementat\u00a1on and evaluation of the MIDD as a whole, The Advisory Committee is also uniquely positioned to leverage the opportunity to engage in deeper, more meaningful behavioral health and criminaljustice systems discussions to create innovation and enhance outcomes for individuals served by MIDD. The MIDD Advisory Committee should also be utilized as a forum to create a \"well connectedness\" between systems, build trust and credibility, particularly with communities of color or other marginalized communities, and resolve systems issues to move whole person care forward.ao Cultural sensitivity o Evaluations and data o The involuntary court process o How treatment courts work & their outcomes.

Delivering on outcomes is a major consideration of MIDD 2 funding and programmatic recommendations. This section, accompanied by the data and information in Appendix J, responds to the requirements of Ordinance 17998 related to demonstrating practice categories (i.e., promising, best or evidence-based practice) and how those practice categories are reflected in the recommended MIDD 2 initiatives. Programs recommended to be supported by MIDD funds are expected to show evidence that they advance the MIDD policy goals. During the Oversight Committee's development of MIDD Values and Guiding Principles and through the course of Community Conversations and other community input, the concept of including \"emerging practices\" as a basis for MIDD 2 arose. Emerging Proctices are those not based on research results \"but for which anecdotal evidence and professional wisdom exists. These include practices that practitioners have tried and claimed effectiveness. Emerging practices also include new technologies that have not yet been researched.\"ss Subject matter experts and community engagement participants communicated that research is often conducted with mainstream participants and results may not be valid or reliable for communities of color or other marginalized groups. Based on this feedback, the category of Emerging Practices is added to the array of practice considerations for MIDD 2 concepts. lt was determined important to include Emerging Practices in the consideration of MIDD programming due to limitations of research-based practices for marginalized communities. Additional information on the use of Evidence-Based Practices is included in a discussion of Equity and SocialJustice on page 64 of this report. Consequently, for purposes of responding to the requirements of Ordinance 17998, \"emerging practices are included. in the category of \"promising practices\" in Appendix J. The established categories of practices used as the basis of MIDD 2 recommendations are described below: Emerging Practices are those not based on research results \"but for which anecdotal evidence and professional wisdom exists. These include practices that practitioners have tried and indicate effectiveness. Emerging practices also include new technologies that have not yet beena ss http://www.cited.orgllibrarylsiTe/C\u00eeEd%20Definitions%20E8,%20Promising,%20Emerging.doc 6LlPagea a1 8406 resea rched.\"s6 Promising Proctices are those developed based on theory or research, but for which an insufficient amount of research results \"have determined the effectiveness of the practice. lf a study uses a weak design resulting evidence is categorized as promising.,,sT Best Proctices are those that have \"been shown by research and experience to produce optimal results and that [are] established or proposed as a standard suitable for widespread adoption.,,ss Evidence-Based Proctices are those for which research has been used \"to determine the effectiveness of the practice, The research utilizes scientifically-based rigorous research designs (i.e., randomized controlled trials, regression discontinuity designs, quasi-experiments, single subject, and qualitative research).\"ss Basis of the practice informed the determination of outcomes. The following approaches were used to determine if recommended MIDD 2 programs had evidence of successful outcomes: ' Staff examined data from MIDD evaluations related to the five MIDD policy goals (for most MIDD 1 programs recommended to continue in MIDD 2 where data was available): o MIDD L policy goals of reduced jail use (goals 1- and 2) were used to identify successful outcomes for criminal justice when there were statistically significant reductions of jail bookings or jaildays. o MIDD L policy goals of symptom reduction, reduced use of emergency departments and psychiatric hospital use (goals 1 and 3) were used to identify behavioral health outcomes,o Behavioral health outcomes that \"improve health and wellness of individuals living with behavioral health conditions (proposed MIDD 2 policy goal) were also considered for MtDD 2 programmatic recommendations. These outcomes include: o lncreased treatment access o lmproved quality of life (stable housing, improved social functioning, coping skills, self- determination and well-being) \u00a1 For new initiatives recommended for MIDD 2, existing evidence (studies, research findings, data) of expected outcomes based on similar programs were analyzed by subject matter experts during the development of briefing papers. lncorporating the Goals of Recovery and Resiliency within a Trauma-lnformed Care Framework: Building on research, practice and the lived experiences of individuals in recovery from mental and/or substance use disorders, the MIDD will use the following working definition of recovery developed by the Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA): A process of change through which individuals improve their health and wellness, live a self-directed life, and strive to reach theirfull potential' \"Recovery\" means a process in which an individual achieves management of the regains or develops sufficient skllls and autonomy to enable the individual to live, work and participate fully in the community. \"Resiliency\" means an innate capacity that empowers people across the life span to successfully meet life's challenges with a sense of self-determination, mastery and hope. \"Trauma-informed framework\" means an approach to engage an individual with a history of trauma that recognizes the presence of trauma symptoms and acknowledges the impact that trauma has had on the individual's life. Overarchingly, the proposed MIDD 2 initiatives promote and support people in all phases of their recovery, analogous to the behavioral health continuum of care reflected in the MIDD 2 Framework, The proposed MIDD 2 initiatives work together and with the broader health and human services and criminal justice systems to provide opportunities for people involved with the behavioral health system to realize their full potential. The Sequential lntercept Model in MIDD 2 Describe how they will integrote and expond the opplicotion of the federol substance obuse and mental health services odministration sequentiol intercept model thot addresses the criminolization of mentolly ill individuols (lines L52-L54) The strategies that made up MIDD 1 were first developed by several community workgroups using the Sequential lntercept Model as a framework to determine what services needed to be provided for which people at what locations in order to help prevent incarceration, hospitalization and homelessness. This model is in use today by a number of communities across the nation as an action blueprint for planning system change in the way that communities address the problem of people with mental illness in their crimina I justice systems. King County further adapted the organizing principles of this modelto include people who may have no mental illness but who are at risk for criminal justice involvement due to substance use, and to include diversion from emergency medical services as another priority. These principles remain in place for MIDD 2 and the initiatives recommended to be funded by MIDD 2. The recognition that the greatest opportunities for diversion exist when individuals are still in the community, and that diversion options decrease as individuals move through the criminal justice system, is reflected throughout MIDD 2. While MIDD L articulated the importance of prevention services, early assessment and intervention, and comprehensive and integrated community-based services, MIDD 2 furthers this understanding by grounding the MIDD 2 initiatives in the continuum of care as reflected by the MIDD 2 Framework. As with MIDD 1, MIDD 2 is devoting considerable resources to supporting a community services system that will serve to divert many individuals from the criminal justice and emergency medical systems while also providing the infrastructure needed to help people who have entered these systems rejoin the community in a safe and effective manner. Through the MIDD programs, individuals with behavioral health needs will be linked to services designed to help them become stable and productive, and prevent unnecessary incarceration and hospitalization. The MIDD 2 Strategy Areas reflecting the behavioral health continuum of care are: 63 lPage'18406 aPrevention and Early lntervention - People get the help they need to stoy heolthy and keep p roble ms from esco loti ng Crisis Diversion - People who ore in crisis get the help they need to avoid unnecessory hospitolization OR incarcerotiona aRecovery and Reentry - People become heolthy ond safety reintegrote to community after crisis System lmprovements - Strengthen the behaviorol health system to become more occessible ond deliver on outcomes Together, the MIDD 2 initiatives will result in improved quality of life for people with mental illness and chemical dependency and their families throughout King County. The Sequential lntercept Model is shown in Appendix A.

Key drivers of such inequities include race and ethnicity, poverty, geographic location, gender and sexual identity, immigration status, limited English proficiency, and physical disability, The County's Equity and Social Justice lnitiative is critical to the implementation of the Service lmprovement plan for MIDD 2. Moreover, guided by the Values and Guiding Principles for MIDD developed by the MtDD Oversight Committee that emphasized equity and social justice, the planning and development of MIDD 2 was conducted with a deep focus on equity and socialjustice.60 Below is a list of several key principles that MIDD 2 considers in the procurement, contracting, training, and/or implementation of programs supported by MIDD 2. Appendix K includes an equity tool that will be used as help guide and inform system improvement/system change processes related to MIDD 2. Culturally Responsive and lnformed: The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Minority Health has released The Nationol Stondords for Culturotty ond Linguisticatly Appropriote Services (CLAS)in Health and Health Core,6l which provides some guideposts for providers of behavioral health services to align with the populations they serve and ensure that services are culturally responsive and informed. ln the HHS Action Plan to Reduce Racialond Ethnic Heatth Disparities,6z several strategies directly relate to the provision of care management teams, including reduce disparities 60 see Appendix c for more information on MIDD 2 planning community efforts. 61 https://www.thi HealthandHumanServices, Health Core.

Using such models as community-based health teams (e.g. health home model) are recommended to establish agreements with primary care providers and other health care providers to improve care coordination. Another HHS Action Plan strategy (2.C364) calls for an increase in the diversity and cultural competency of clinicians, including behavioral health workers. This guidance provides an opportunity for King County to implement MIDD 2 with a heightened emphasis on servingthe County's most marginalized populations, and align with national best practices on care coordination and treatment services that are culturally responsive and informed. It is the intent of King County that services provided under MIDD 2 be culturally responsive and culturally specific. Enacting this intention requires the willingness of both providers and King County to acknowledge historical and cultural trauma as sources of substance use and other behavioral health conditions and the willingness to do business differently to serve people in culturally responsive and specific manners. MIDD-supported direct services should address individual level discrimination that those served encounter in their daily lives by recognizing institutional and structural racism, classism, and ableism. Community-based agencies providing culturally specific and culturally responsive behavioral health, primary care and reentry support services will be sought to provide these services under MIDD 2, Addressing trauma as a result of both interpersonal violence and childhood experiences as well as historical and cultural trauma will be critical for serving the individuals served by publicly-funded behavioral health services. MIDD 2 providers should explore and implement the use of alternative interventions which are culturally informed, such as substance use disorder treatment for historically disempowered communities,6s which may yield more meaningful treatment outcomes for marginalized populations. King County willencourage organizations receiving MIDD 2 funds to provide technicalassistance and/or sub-contract with smaller community groups and organizations to increase participation by community groups and organizations that may have difficulty meeting the County's contracting requirements. ln addition, when possible, King County will utilize flexible contracting approaches to reduce barriers that make it more difficult for small organizations to participate. Evidence-Based Practices and Equity: lt is expected that whenever possible, evidence-based practices (EBPs) are to be embedded in the service continuum of MIDD 2. Because most mental health/substance use disorder treatment EBPs are researched on predominantly mainstream/White populations, it is impoftant to have a critical and continuous improvement lens to these behavioral health services to ensure that services are not perpetuating marginalization and negatively impacting those individuals being served, furthering their disenfranchisement. lt is necessary that whenever possible, MIDD 2 use anti-oppressive practices to complement recovery oriented and person-centered approaches. Harm Reduction: Where possible, MIDD 2 initiatives should employ a harm reduction model. Harm 63 http://www,minorityhealth.hhs.gov/npa/files/Plans/HHS/HHS_Plan_complete.pdf.

Harm reduction is a grass-roots and \"user-driven\" set of compassionate and pragmatic approaches to reducing substance-related harm and improving quality of life.66 While there is no universal definition or formula for harm reduction given the multiple different interventions and policies designed to serve an individual in need of behavioral health services, there are key principles for harm reduction that MIDD 2 initiatives are encouraged to demonstrate such as:\u00a1 accepting the individual regardless of their behavior \u00a1 understanding the complex continuum of behaviors while acknowledging that there are safer ways to engage in certain behaviors o establishing quality of individual/community life and well-being as criteria for successful interventions. Harm reduction is linked to equity and social justice because provision of services should be nonjudgmental, non-coercive and recognize the realities of poverty, class, racism, social isolation, past trauma, sex-based discriminations and all other social inequalities that affect an individual's vulnerability to, and capacity for, effectively changing behavior.6T Serving lndividuals Who Have Contact with the Criminal Justice system: Though the County is actively working to address overrepresentation of individuals from non-white racial and ethnic groups, disproportionality currently exists in the County's justice system. When providing MIDD 2 services to people involved with the justice system, there is a need to ensure that an anti-oppressive practice lens is applied to the behavioral health services provided to non-white and other marginalized groups. MIDD 2 should provide or leverage the provision of culturally responsive and specific services and reentry opportunities. lntegration w\u00a1th the County's Policy and planning Work Demonstrate how they will expond, enhonce, and integrote with the County's plonning ond poticy endeavors such os, but not Iimited to, the Heolth and Humon Services Tronsformotion plan, the youth Action Plon, the Veterons ond Human Services Levy, the Ten Yeor Plan to End Homelessness, ond recommendotions of the Tosk Force on Prevention, Eorly lntervention, ond Least Restrictive Alternatives for lndividuals in Mental Heolth and Substance Abuse crisis (tines i.57-162) The MIDD 2 Framework explicitly conveys the expected linkage between MIDD 2 and other county and community initiatives. MIDD 2 is grounded in a collaborative approach to information sharing, evaluation, aligning of services and braiding of funds. As with MIDD 1, the proposed MIDD 2 initiatives are expected to individually and as a whole advance/integrate with the County's planning and policy initiatives. For example, the proposed youth Behavioral Health Alternatives to Secure Detention initiative is intended to link to and furtherthe work 66 Collins, Clifasefi et of the Juvenile Justice Equity Steering Committee. School-based services supported by MIDD 2 will align with BSK work, The proposed Multipronged Opioid initiative is planned to support recommendations from the Heroin and Prescription Opiate Addiction Task Force. Proposed initiatives involving housing supports and resources for capital and rental assistance further the goals of the All Home68 strategic plan. Elements of the County's Equity and Social Justice6e strategic plan are reflected throughout the MIDD 2, from how the MIDD 2 recommendations were determined, to the recommended revised composition of the Advisory Committee, The MIDD 2 lmplementation Plan that will be submitted to the Council in2017 after adoption of the 2017-2018 MIDD 2 budget will include how each initiative will link to the County's policy and planning work. Affordable Care Act and Behavioral Health lntegration Opportunities Demonstrate how they will leverage opportunities provided by the federal Affordoble Care Act ond the stote's requirements for o single behoviorol heolth controct with regionol support networks as specified by Chapter 225, Lows of Washington 225 (lines L6j-L65) Medicaid Expansion: One of the main goals of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is to increase access to health care coverage for individuals. As a Medicaid expansion state, more individuals than ever are covered by Medicaid in Washington and in King County, allowing them to access and receive Medicaid- covered physical, mental health and substance use disorder services. As such, Medicaid can now pay for more traditional outpatient and inpatient mental health and substance use disorder treatment services for a larger number of covered children, youth and adults. The increase in Medicaid-eligible individuals and subsequent increase in Medicaid funding, allows King County to continue to direct MIDD 2 funding toward services that are not covered by Medicaid and/or individuals who remain uninsured to help build a robust continuum of care. Behavioral Health Integration: A second goal of the ACA is to achieve the \"Triple Aim\" - improved care, improved outcomes and reduced overall costs in healthcare services. One significant strategy to achieve this goal is through the integration of physical and behavioral healthcare. ln 20L4, Washington State legislature passed ESSB 6312 calling for the integrated purchasing of mental health and substance use treatment services (collectively behavioral health) for the Medicaid program through a single managed care contract by April 1., 201.6. The previous, siloed system of Regional Support Networks (RSNs) and County Chemical Dependency Coordinators went away and were replaced by Behavioral Health Organizations (BHOs). BHOs are local entities at full risk and responsibility for providing the continuum of Medicaid funded inpatient and outpatient mental health and substance use disorder treatment services. On April L, 20!6, King County, through the Behavioral Health and Recovery Division, became the Behavioral Health Organization (BHO) for the region. Today, BHRD is able to braid together multiple funding sources including Medicaid, state generalfund, mental health and substance use disorder block grant and MIDD dollars to ensure a comprehensive continuum of behavioral health services are 68 Formerly the Committee to End Homelessness. The All Home strategic plan outlines steps to end homelessness. http://a llhome kc. o rglthe-pla n/ to clients in need MIDD 2 will support and leverage opportunities provided under the ACA and through implementation of ESSB 63L2 in a variety of ways, including o lncreasing access to behavioral health treatment for people with mental health, substance use or co-occu rring disorders Supporting earlier interventions for people with mental illness and substance use or co-occurring disorders to prevent unnecessary use of jail, emergency rooms, avoidable hospitalizations and crisis services Supporting models of care that deliver or drive toward fully integrated physical and behavioral health care, a model known to improve overall health and social outcomes Supporting the development and use of mechanisms that engage individuals with mental health, substance use and co-occurring disorders and link to comprehensive treatment through the King County Behavioral Health Organization (KCBHO) Enhancing the continuum of care offered through the KCBHO by providing services that are not Medicaid-eligible or serving individuals who would not otherwise have insurance coverage Serving as entry points to get people enrolled in Medicaid so that their physical and behavioral health care needs can be covered through the Medicaid program and the KcBHo. Fully lntegrated Managed Care: The 6312 legislation also called for full integration of mental health, substance use and physical health care by January I, 2020. This includes aspects of both clinical integration and financial integration for the state Medicaid program. Today, Medicaid physical health care services are purchased through five Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) while Medicaid behavioral health services are purchased through regional BHOs. ln King County the five MCOs are Amerigroup, Community Health Plan of Washington, Coordinated Care, Molina and United Health Care. As the state moves forward with plans to fully integrate physical and behavioral health care, King. County has significant decisions to make related to what the financial infrastructure for fully integrated managed care will be and what the optimal role of the county is in that model. King County is considering a number of potential options and working with community stakeholders and partners to identify the best path forward. The decisions King County makes regarding its future role in fully integrated managed care will significantly impact how and what programs are implemented under the MIDD and could require a complete retooling of the MIDD 2 programming before it expires at the end of 2025. Earlier this year, the Health Care Authority and the Department of Social and Health Services jointly issued a letter to counties identifying three potential timelines for moving to fully integrated managed care.Thoseoptionsincludeastartdateof:JulyL,2OI7;July1.,2O18;orJanuary I,2O2O.KingCountyisa a 68 lPage1 8406 consider\u00a1ng the 201\"8 and the 2020 options and will make recommendations in late 2016 or early 20L7 to the King County Executive and Council regarding the recommended path forward and the optimal timeline for implementation based on the magnitude of change required and community readiness, The implications of this decision for MIDD 2 could be significant regardless of what option King County chooses. For example, if King County selects an option that includes Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) having primary risk and responsibility for the full continuum of physical and behavioral health care for Medicaid eligible individuals through a single managed care contract with the state, the role of King County in the administration and delivery of behavioral health services related to Medicaid would shift to one of primary monitoring/oversight and assurance. This would require revisiting MIDD 2 investments in light of the county's revised role for behavioral health. Research shows that fully integrated physical and behavioral health care achieves better outcomes for clients. As King County works to determine the optimal path to full integration for the region, the focus will be on keeping clients at the center of planning and ensuring a system care that provides the best experience, improves outcomes and reduces overall costs to the system. Once the decisions about the fully integrated managed care infrastructure and timeline for implementation are known, King County will need to revisit all MIDD 2 supported programs to evaluate them in relationship to the system transformation that will occur, BHRD commits to sharing progress on this decision openly and frequently with policymakers and the MIDD Advisory Committee. There will be clear points of public comment established and the Advisory Committee and MIDD stakeholders will be invited to weigh in on the recommendations, 69 lPage1 8406 Vl. Next Steps This section acknowledges three specific next steps necessary for MIDD 2: completion of the MIDD 2 lmplementation and Evaluation Plans and a process to change the name of the MIDD. Each component will be developed collaboratively with the MIDD Advisory Committee and other stakeholders. MIDD 2 lmplementat\u00a1on plan Additional planning is needed for most of the new initiatives contained in the proposed MIDD 2, many of them requiring community engagement components. For each MIDD 2 initiative, the MIDD 2 lmplementation Plan that will be transmitted to the Council in 2Ot7 will includeTo:r Description of the initiative/program/servicesr How the initiative advances the MIDD 2 policy goals. Goalof the initiative\u00a1 Outcomes and performance measures\u00a1 Expected number of individuals served\u00a1 Provided by contractor or county. Spending plan (based on adopted budget). lmplementation schedule (for new initiatives)r Procurement and contracting details\u00a1 Services start date (new)o What community engagement will occur and when\u00a1 Other relevant information as directed by the Council or requested by stakeholders. The MIDD Oversight Committee was deeply involved in the development and review of MIDD 1 implementation plan documents. Similarly, it is expected that the Advisory Committee will play a significant role with the implementation planning for MtDD 2 that will occur in 2OIt. MIDD 2 Evaluation Plan The MIDD L Evaluation Plan adopted by the council in 2008 served as the blueprint for conducting the evaluation and assessment of MIDD. The MIDD L Evaluation Plan was developed in conjunction with the MIDD 1- lmplementation Plan, after the individual MIDD l strategies were established in the Council adopted MIDD Action Plan. The MIDD 1 lmplementation Plan specified how each MtDD l strategy would be executed and individual MIDD strategy implementation information was used to develop an evaluation approach for each program supported by MIDD funds. MIDD policy goals and strategies were linked to the results, which in turn provided a structure for identifying performance indicators, targets and data sources, and for collecting and reporting results.Tl 70 Please note that the lnitiative Description Documents that are included in this plan are not lmplementation plans. Theinformation in these documents as will be revised to include updated policy goals, adopted budget, and commun\u00a1ty engagement plans and other required information. lmplementation Plans will be reviewed by the MIDD Advisory Committeeand stakeholders. 71 The MIDD oversight committee reviewed and provided input into the development of the MIDD Evaluation plan that wasadopted bythe Council, in accordance with ordinance 15949. See the MIDD Evaluation plan that is Appendix E to this report. T0 lPage1 8406 A detailed MIDD 2 Evaluation Plan will be transmitted to the Council in2Ot7.ln orderto complete an Evaluation Plan for MIDD 2, final MIDD 2 funding and programmatic decisions are needed, which are expected with adoption of the County's 2Ot7-20L8 biennial budget. Further, it is necessaryto develop a MIDD 2 Evaluation Plan that is built on the recommendations contained in the MIDD Comprehensive Historical Assessment Report, which includes stakeholder involvement in the development of the MIDD 2 Evaluation Plan. See Appendix L for the MIDD evaluation recommendations. To the extent possible, DCHS will align its approach to MIDD 2 evaluation planning with evaluation planning for BSK. The MtDD 2 Evaluation Plan will contain most, if not all, of the same elements as called for in the MIDD 1 Evaluation Plan: a a a a a o o o oRequirements of the MIDD 1 Evaluation Plan Process and outcome evaluation components A proposed schedule for evaluation Performance measurements and performance measurement targets Data elements that will be used for reporting and evaluation Performance measures including: the amount of funding contracted to date the number and status of request for proposals to date individual program status and statistics such as individuals served data on utilization of theustice and eme medical s. As with BSK, the MIDD 2 Evaluation Plan will include the overarching principles, framing questions and approaches that will guide the evaluation and performance measurement of MIDD 2. As MIDD 2 initiatives are refined and programs are selected over the remainder of 20L6, the MIDD evaluation framework will be developed, particularly with respect to initiative-level performance metrics and targets. The structure for MIDD 2 evaluation and performance measurement will be based on the MIDD 2 Framework (Appendix F). Much has changed in the eight years since the MIDD 1- Evaluation Plan was completed, including behavioral health integration and technological advances. Yet, the purpose for evaluating MIDD 2 remains the same: providing the public and policy makers with the tools to evaluate the effectiveness of the MIDD strategies in meeting the established MIDD policy goals, as wellas to ensure transparency and accountability. Changing the Name of the MIDD Through the course of MIDD l- review and MIDD 2 planning, the county received feedback that the name of the MIDD---the Mental lllness and Drug Dependencv sales tax and programs-is outdated, negative, disrespectfuland stigmatizing. ln essence, the name of the MIDD is not itself recovery-based and may be cou nterproductive to wellness. lnitially, changing the name of MIDD was not pursued as part of MIDD review and planning based on the understanding that MIDD is known statewide as a King County brand. Given the feedback the King County Behavioral Health and Recovery Division has received over the last few months, this item is now identified as something that will be staged to move forward in VOT7, Community input as well as TL lPage1 8406 Advisory Committee leadership will be critically important Changing the name of the MIDD will require revision to the King County Code and other adopted legislation. Executive staff willworkwith the Code Reviser, the Prosecutor's Office and Councilstaff on this issue. T2lPage1 8406 Vll. Conclusion This report fulfills the requirements of Ordinance 17998 calling for a MIDD Service lmprovement Plan. County staff, in partnership with the MIDD Oversight Committee, accomplished this work through broad and specific community and stakeholder activities, extensive community processes and analysis. The groundbreaking MIDD 1 provided a strong foundation on which to plan and build MIDD 2, taking the very best of what worked and retooling where needed to address challenges so that the MIDD is positioned to help the County's behavioral health and criminaljustice systems to serve more people and achieve more notable outcomes. The proposed MIDD 2 programmatic and funding recommendations are a holistic approach to the continuum of behavioral health services, grounded in the principles of equity and social justice and recovery and resiliency. The proposed initiatives were deliberately and intentionally developed with input from a wide array of stakeholders and communities; they were subject to wide public review and comment, which yielded meaningful changes to the proposals. The services, programs and systems supported by MIDD 2 initiatives are interwoven and interdependent. Recommended improvements to the composition of the MIDD Advisory Committee are intended to bring greater depth and breadth of subject matter expertise and knowledge and experiences to the review of MIDD initiatives and outcomes, while operational improvementS are intended to make full use of the capabilities of the committee. Revised fund balance and reserve policies are intended to strengthen the MIDD Fund's financial position and provide clarity around use of fund balance. MIDD 2 is deeply aligned with BSK and other initiatives. lf the recommendations in this report are supported by the King County Council, it is the intent of the Department of Community and Human Services to implement them in collaboration with providers, stakeholders and the MIDD Advisory Commlttee. The recommendations range from low cost and easily executed, such as \"align evaluation reporting period to calendar year\" to those that may involve additional resources and be more complex to enact, such as developing a digital dashboard, or establishing a Consumers and Communities Ad Hoc Work Group. Many of the recommendations require retooling internal processes and will necessarily lead to changes in data collection approaches, reporting, and timelines. Fulfilling these recommendations will require time, MIDD resources, and willingness of systems and organizations to embark upon and enact change. All MIDD stakeholders, internal and external to King County, including citizens, policymakers, providers, separately elected officials, and jurisdictional partners are impacted by these recommendations, and as such, their support and participation is critical for the ongoing success of MIDD. While it has been demonstrated that MIDD 1-supported programs have resulted in reduced jail bookings and shorter hospitalstays, individuals with mental health and substance use conditions continue to end up in jails and emergency services because other options are not available - to them or to first T3 lPage1 8406 responders who come into contact with them - during times of crisis. lndividuals with behavioral health conditions are often also impacted by homelessness, receive uncoordinated and fragmented services, and experience other significant barriers to getting the resources and supports needed in order to thrive in the community, Behavioral health conditions are further exacerbated by lack of diverse culturally and linguistically competent services available in the community. MIDD is but one element to address these iss ues. As documented in this and other reports, the world of behavioral health care is rapidly evolving. Actions such as state mandated behavioral health integration, court rulings, along with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, require King county and its behavioral health and criminal justice partners to continue the historical collaboration initiated by the development of MIDD l over eight years ago to make further meaningful systems improvements. The MIDD planning processes have taken into account the changing landscape of behavioral health, while continuing to build on the strong foundation of MIDD L. County staff are prepared to lead the work necessary to re-envision and re-tool MIDD programs to achieve even greater C: Community Conversations & Focus Group Themes Appendix D: Briefing Paper Review Panel Sorting...

Munetz, M.D. P.atricia A. Griffin, ph.D The Sequential Intercept Model provides a conceptual framework for communities to use when considering the inter{ace between the crimi, nal justice and rnental health systems as they address concerns about crirninalization of people with mental illness. The model envisions a se- ries of points of interception at which an interwention can be made to prevent individuals from entering or penetrating deeper into the crim- inal justice system. Ideall\u00a1 rnost people will be int\u00e3rcepted at early points, with decreasing nurnbers at each subsequent point. The inter- ception points are law enforcement and .rtt.\"g\"ir\"y..-r-r,i\"..; initial de- tention and initial hearings; jail, courts, forensic evaluations, and foren- sic comrnitrnents; reentry from jails, state prisons, and forensic hospi- talization; and comrnunit\u00a1r corrections and community support, TLe rnodel provitles an organizing tool for a cliscussion of diversion and link- age alterrratives antl for systematically addressing criminalization, Us- ing the rnodel, a cornrnuni\u00fez can develop targeted strategies that evolve over time to increase diversion of people with mental illness from the criminal justice system and to link thern with community treatment.

The Sequential Intercept Model: ideals and description We start wit\u00ec.r the ideal tl.rat people with mental disorders should not \"penetrate\" the criminal justice sys-tem at a greatel fiequency tiran peo- ple in community witliout mental disorders (personal communi- cation, Steadman H, Feb 23, 2001). Although the natule of mental illness makes it likely that people with symp- tomatic illness will have contact witl-r law enforcement and the courts, the presence of mental illness should not result in unnecessary arrest ol incar- ce\u00a1ation. People with mental illness wl\"ro commit crimes with criminal in- tent that are un\u00a1elated to sympto- matic mental illness should be held accountable for their actions, as any- one else would be. However, people with mental ilhress should not be ar- lested or incarcerated simply because of t\u00ecreir mental disorder o\u00a1 lack of ac- cess to appropr'late treatlnent-nor should such people be detained in jails or prisons longer than others simply because of their illness. With botl.r tliis ideal and current re- alities in rnind, we envision a series of \"points of interception\" or opportuni- ties for an intervention to prevent in- dividuals wit\u00ccr mental illneis from en- tering or penetr\u00e2ting deeper into tl're criminal justice syste\u00ecn, Ideally, most people will be intercepted at ear\u00fe points. Each point ofinterception can be considered a f\u00eciter (Figure 1). In communities with poorly developed mental health systems and no active collaboration between the rnental health and criminal justice systerns, tl're f\u00eclters will be porous. Few will be intercepted early, and mole people witir mental illness will move through all levels of the criminal justice sys- tem, As systems and collaboration de- velop, the filter systenr. showing the rvays ir\"r typically svstem.

Intercept 2: initial hearings and initial detention Postarrest diversion ptogr\u00e2n'rs are t\u00ecre next point ofinterception. Even when optimal mental llealth service systems and effective prear.rest di- version programs are in place, some individuals with serious mental dis- orders will nevel'theless be arrested. On tlie basis of the natur.e of tl\"re clime, such individuals may be ap- propriate for divelsion to tre\u00e2tmeltt, either as an alternative to prosecu- tion or as an alterrrative to incal.cer.- ation, as a of syn-rptornatic mental illness.

In communities with strong intercept I programs, postar- rest diversion candidates are likelyto be charged with mor.e sel.ior\u00a1s acts.

Alterna- tivel\u00a1 courts develop collabora- tive relationships witli the public rrrental healtll system, which would provide staff to conduct \u00bf\u00ecssessments and facilitate links to comrrunity serwices. Examples of plogranrs that inter.- cept at or petsons rvho T\u00ccte police are often the ffrst cailed to deal with persons with rnen- enfor.ce- of patrol officer en- counters involve per.sons wit\u00ecr mental disorders (l7,lB). Accor.dingly, law errforcement is a cr.ucial point of in- telception to divert people with men- tal illness f\u00a1on-r the criminal justice systenl. Historicall\u00a1 mental health systems \u00bfurd lavv enfo\u00a1cement agencies have not rvorked closely together. There has been little joint planning, cross training, or planned collaboration in the f\u00eceld. Police officers have consid- elable discretion in resolving interac- tions u.itli people who rnental disorders (19). Alrest often tlie op- tion of last resolt, but u,hen officers lack knorvledge of alter.r'r\u00bfrtives and cannot gain \u00e2ccess to them, t\u00ccrey see ar\u00ec'est as t\u00ecte only available dispo- sition f'or people who clearly cannot be left on the street. L\u00bfrmb and colleagues (16) de- 5&scribed several stlategies used by po- lice departments, with or without the participation of local n.rental health systems, to more effectively deal with pelsons witl'r mental illness who are in crisis in the comlnulritv: mo- bile crisis teams of rnental i'realth professionals, mental health workers employed by the police to pr\"ovicle on-site and telephone consultation to officers in the f\u00eceld, teaming of specially trained police officers with mental health workels fi'orn the pub- lic mental healt\u00ec-r system to address clises in the field, and creation of a team of police officer.s who have re- ceived specialized mental health training and who then respond to calls thought to involve people with mental disorders. The prototype of the specia\u00ecized police officer ap- proac\u00ecr is the Mempliis Crisis Inter-- vention Tearn (CIT) (20,21), which is based on collaboration between law enforcement, the local community rnental \u00ecrealth system, and other key stakel'rolders. A cornpalison of three police-basecl divelsion models (22) found the Memphis CIT program to PSYCHIAIRICSERVICES I ps.psychiaffyonline.org I April2006 Vol. 57 Reentry front jai\u00ecs, the divelsior-r plograln found in Con- necticut (23) and tlie local dive\u00a1sior.r programs found in Phoe\u00a1rix (24) and Miami (25).

In reality, however, it is clear that both iocal jails and state prisons house substarrtial numbels of individuals with rnental iilnesses. In addition, studies in local jurisdic- tions have found that jail inrnates with severe mental illness are \u00ccikely to spend significant\u00ecy more tirre in jail tlian other inmates rvho have the same charges but who do not have severe mental illness (27,28). As a result, prompt access to high-quaiity treatrrent in local correctional set- tings is clitical to stabilization ar-rd successful eventual transitiolr to the community An intercept 3 itrteruention that is currently receiving considerable at- tention is the establishrnent of a sepa- rate docket or court progr'\u00e2m specif\u00ec- cally to addless the needs ofindividu- the criminal jus- tice system of tl're def\u00e8ndants who come before tl\"rern. The N\u00bfrtional GAINS Centel estimates th\u00bfrt there are now 114 rrental health coults for adults in tl're United States (33).Intercept 4: reentry from jails, prisons, and hospitals There is little continuity of care be- tween co\u00a1r'ections and comrnunity mental health systems fol' individuals with mental illness who leave colrec- tional settings (34), Typically, com- rnunication between the two systen'\u00ecs is limited, and the public mental l-realth system may be unaware when clients ale incarcerated. Mental health systems rarely systematically follow their clients once they have been incarcerated. In a recent survey ofjails in New Jerse\u00a1 only three jails leported providing release plans fol a rnajority of their inmates rvitl-r mental illness, ancl only two reported lou- tinely providing transitional psy- chotlopic medications upon release to the connunity (35). Nationally, tl.re issue of facilitating contir-ruity of care and leentry from correctional settings is receiving in- creasing attention. In part t\u00ecrese ef- forts are fueled by class action litiga- tion against local colrections and n'rental health systems fol to plovide aftercare linkages, such as t\u00ec-re successful Bracl H case against the Neu,York City jail system (36). In ad- dition, pressure is increasing on co\u00ec'- rections and mental health systems to stop the cycle of lecidivism frequent- ly associated with people with severe n'rental illness rvho become involved in tl're crirninal justice The APIC rnodel for transitional planning florn local\u00a1ails that has been proposed by Oshel and colleagues (40) bleaks new ground with its focus on assessing, planning, identifying, and coordinating transitional care.

At the end of 2003, an estimated 4.8 rnillion adults were under federal, state, or local pro'ba- tion or parole jurisdiction (42). Com- pliance with mental l-realth treatment is a frequent condition of plobation or parole. Failure to attend treatment appointments often results in revoca- tion of probation and retuln to incar- ceration, Promising recent research by Skeem and colleagues (43) has be- gun to closely examine how probation off\u00eccers implement requirements to participate in mandated psychiatric treatment and what approaches ap- pear to be most effective. Other research by Solomon and as- sociates (44) has examined proba- tioners' involvement in various types of mental health seryices and their lelationship to technical violations of probation and incarceration. Similar' to mental hea\u00cctl'r courts, a variety of jurisdictions use designated proba- tion ol parole officers who have spe- cialized caseloads of plobationers with mental illness, The probation and parole committee of the Ohio Supleme Court advisory committee on mentally ill in the courts (45,46) lias developed a mental healtl.r train- ing curriculum for parole and proba- tiorr officers. Discussion Some people may argue tl-rat the basic building blocks of an effective mental health system are lachng in rnany cornmunities, and therefore efforts to leduce tl-re overrepresentation of people with mental illness in the crirninaljustice system are futile. This argument is not pelsuasive. Even the rnost undedunded mental health sys- tens can wor* to improve services to ind\u00cdviduals with the gleatest need, in- cluding the gloup ofpeople with seri- ous and persistent mental disorders who have fiequent interaction with the criminal justice system. Such ef- forts lequire close collaboration be- tween the mental health and criminal justice systems, The Sequential Intercept Model provides a fi'amewolk for communi- ties to consider as they address con- cerns about criminalization of peo- ple with mental illness in their juris- diction.

From September through December 201\"6, King County invited communities to participate in five regional Community Conversations on MlDDl. Between October 2015 and February 201\"6, county staff held i-4 focus groups involving specific communities, populations, or sub-regional areas. The purpose of these engagement efforts was to hear ideas about services and programs for people living with mental illness and substance use disorders. The conversations were intentionally designed so that community members could have a role in informing the County's decisions around its investments for children and youth and investments for mental health and substance use disorder services and programs, Forthe Community Conversations, participants engaged in small discussions based on birth to young adult age groups and MIDD Strategy Areas. Conversations were flexible and welcome to all ideas to allow participants to fully engage.

Non-Medicaid services are necessary to fill a significant gap in the service system since many people still do not qualify for Medicaid. Primary Needs and Gaps ldentified by Respondents to the Mental lllness and Drug Dependency (MIDD) Review and Renewal Survey September 2015 - February 2016 As part of the Mental lllness and Drug Dependency (MIDD) renewal work by King County, an electronic survey was made available between September 2015 and February 20L6, The purpose of the survey was to gather feedback on a number of aspects of MIDD. The County received 362 responses. One question specifically asked respondents to describe in narrative the specific mental health or substance abuse service gaps in their communities where new or expanded mental health, substance abuse, or therapeutic court services could make a difference. Narrative responses to this question from 262 survey participants identified the following as the top L2 areas of need. Please note that not all survey respondents elected to answer this question, MIDD SURVEY: TOP AREAS OF NEED OR SERVICE GAPS !.

Briefing papers considered by the different review panels are linked below: o Prevention and Earlv lntervention r Grisis Diversion o Recovery and Re-Entry o Svstem lmprovement The panels were constructed to bring in a diverse array of lived experiences, skills, knowledge, perspectives, and insights to the sorting process. Each reviewpanel included a mix of community members and MIDD Oversight Committee members or their designees. The work of the panels included deep discussion of each briefing paper and sorting the strategies and concepts into high, medium, and low categories for potential funding consideration. The results areshown in the following graphs in order of the percentage of red \"high\" votes of all high votes for the panel, with percentage of yellow \"medium,,votes also shown of all medium votes for the panel.

Purchases over $2,499 for a single purchase of goods or services and/or purchases of over $2,500 in a calendar year to a single vendor or provider require a contract. When the County initiates a contracting process the default procurement stance is that a competitive process to identify the vendor/provider must occur. A competitive bid process shall be utilized when: A. The County has new funding to purchase services(e.g. new grants, new levies, new allocations from funders); B. A new program/service is to be implemented; C. There is a change in requirements or regulations related to services/programs currently under contract with the County requiring a substantial revision in the scope of services; or D. The funder of programs/services requires competitive procurement process for new funds and/or ongoing funds at a specified frequency. The following categories of purchases are exempt from the requirement of a competitive bid process: A. Purchases that are covered by a blanket contract entered into by King County Purchasing. B. Purchases of services where an there is an existing contract within the Division/Department that purchases the same scope of work: The purchase adds capacity to the program (e.9. purchases more program slots, or bed days); or The purchase expands the population to be served (without changing the scope of work); C. Purchases where there is only one source that can provide the scope of work (A Sole Source Waiver must be sought and authorized from King County Purchasing) 1. The County has been told by a funder to hire a particular (sub)contractor; or2. There is only one expert/specialty organization in the region that can deliver the scope of work. Methods Utilized for Competitive Bid Processes The competitive bid processes below are solicited by the County. The responses to these solicitations are evaluated against the County's criteria/requirements for the service/program and awards are made for responses that best meet the County's needs/specifications.

How does the program advance the recommended MIDD policy goals? This program primarily addresses the recommended MIDD policy goal of \"divert individuals with behavioral health needs from costly interventions, such as jail, emergency rooms, and hospitals.\" Drug use, mental illness and homelessness often generate behaviors that fuel repeated involvement with the criminaljustice system, impede an individual's recovery, and foster leg itimate comm un ity public safety/order concerns.' The Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) program diverts individuals who are engaged in low-level drug crime, prostitution, and other collateral crime due to drug involvement, from the justice system, bypassing prosecution and jailtime, to directly connect drug-involved individuals to case managers who can provide immediate assessment and crisis response, and long term wrap-around services to address the cycling of individuals with behavioral issues through the criminal justice system. LEAD intercepts the individual and divert the behavioral problem at the point of law enforcement response, to channel drug-involved individuals into a community-based intervention whenever possible and appropriate. LEAD is based in the principles of harm reduction,2 which focuses on the prevention of harms to individuals and communities that are related to drug usage/dependency in individuals who are unable or unwilling to stop. LEAD is a community policing effort, addressing low-level drug crimes with socioeconomic and health impacts, and providing law enforcement with credible alternatives to booking people into jail. 1. Program Description O A. Servlce Components/Design (Brief) All LEAD participants receive case management, which supports fulfilment of basic needs, and may include housing stability, job attainment or income stabilization, enrollment in drug and alcohol treatment, and coordination of all criminaljustice involvement and prosecution to support and not compromise LEAD intervention plans. ln 1 King County's Familiar Faces project found that nearly all individuals with four or more bookings into the County's jails in a year have a behavioral health indicator of drug dependency or mental illness, and at least one other acute or chronic medical condition. More than half (likely undercounted) were homeless. Familiar Faces: Currenf Sfafe - Analysis of Population, September 28,2015' Harm reduction interventions are designed to meet individuals where they currently are in their lives and their motivation to change, in order to tailor strategies to meet their specific needs and to minimize the specific harms to themselves and their community. \"Harm reduction strategies can be effective in reducing harm, increasing the quality of life and decreasing high-risk behaviors.\" Marlatt, G. 1 of 25 of 2901 8406Append\u00a1x H MIDD 2 Service lmprovement Plan lnitiative Description - Preliminary lmplementation lnformation Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (CD-1) general, LEAD pursues the goals of the individual participant, as identified by the case manager and the participant in an lndividual lntervention plan. Case managers provide street-based outreach and engagement, as well as immediate response to unscheduled needs wherever possible. Case managers use motivational interviewing techniques, and establish a low- or no-barrier atmosphere that ensures participants are not shamed and can readily re-engage when they have struggled or are struggling. The second component of LEAD is the coordination of all prosecution and contact participants may have with the criminaljustice system for other cases that may not be eligible for diversion. The prosecution coordination component of LEAD supp\u00f4rts prosecutors to make discretionary decisions about whether to file charges, recommend pre-trial detention or release conditions, reduce charges, recommend i\u00f1carceration after conviction, and/or dismiss charges, in a way that supports the intervention plan designed for the particular participant, in order to maximize community health and safety. Another component of the LEAD program is engagement with the community and addressing neighborhoods' concerns with criminal activity and public safety. This takes the form of ongoing education and dialogue with community leaders about the LEAD approach, coordination of information between neighborhood leaders and the operationalworkgroup regarding LEAD pa.rticipants and neighborhood hotspots and concerns. lt also generates community-based social contact referrals to LEAD that can be validated by law enforcement as appropriate referrals. Through LEAD, community- generated pressure for traditional enforcement can be transformed into participation in alternative health-based responses. Specific strategies of the LEAD program include:. effective training of and engagement with front-line law enforcement officers (officers and sergeants) to enlist their active participation in this approach, to familiarize them with harm reduction principles, and to tap into their experience and knowledge of the streetinvolved population;. coordination by prosecutors of LEAD participants' filed criminal cases with the lndividual lntervention Plan established by LEAD case managers, wherever possible;. ongoing community outreach and engagement;. prov\u00a1sion of case management in a harm reduction/Housing First framework;. assistance in removing legal obstacles to improved life circumstances; and. coordination with public defenders to receive defense-initiated social contact referrals and ensure defenders integrate LEAD into defense planning for resolution of filed cases as appropriate. Page 2 of 6 26 of 2901 8406 Appendix H MIDD 2 Service lmprovement Plan lnitiative - Preliminary lmplementation lnformation Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (CD-1) 0 L Goals As described above, the primary objectives of LEAD are to reduce recidivism and criminaljustice costs, and to increase positive psychosocial, housing and quality-of-life outcomes for participants. 0 C. Expected Numbers of lndividuals Served The increased level of financial participation by MIDD will support the delivery of the LEAD program for approximately 500 participants. Potential service recipients would be located in currently funded areast as well as other communities that have expressed interest in becoming partners in the delivery of LEAD. There is a particular interest among LEAD's policy coordinating group in exploring opportunities to expand LEAD into South and East King County jurisdictions that presently make comparatively high use of King County Jail facilities for individuals with frequent bookings,a as part of a countywide strategy to increase access to the program and decrease the unnecessary use of jail. Of note, the current LEAD case management level of care may need to be enhanced for some individuals who are referred to the program. Through other demonstration efforts, more intensive levels of care will become available to address higher needs. Over time, it is the goal to have agencies contracted by BHRD provide this intensive care as part of the LEAD service mix. \u00e7 D. Draft Outcomes and Performance Measures - outcomes and measures are expected to be revised and included in the MIDD 2 Evaluation Plan. This initiative contributes to population outcomes of the MIDD 2 Framework, including. reduced jail, hospital, and emergency department use. reduced substance use. improved daily functioning The following individual-level outcome measures (MIDD 2 Framework language used where applicable) for program participants may include:.. increased use of preventive (outpatient) services. reduced behavioral health risk factors. reduced unnecessaryincarceration. reduced substance use. increased stability in treatment, employment, or other quality of life measures t LEAD launched as a pilot in Seattle's Belltown neighborhood and King County's Skyway neighborhood in2O11, fundedentirelybygrantsfromprivatefoundations. ln2Ol4,withsupportfromtheCityofSeattle,andattherequest of other downtown Seattle neighborhoods, the program was expanded to include the rest of downtown Seattle. LEAD received $800,000 in one{ime funding from MIDD 1 in 20'16. The City of Seattle plans to expand LEAD to its East precinct (Capitol Hill) in 2016, and, since other Seattle neighborhoods have requested LEAD, the City Council has requested a plan for how to scale up citywide. The Sound Cities Association has also entered discussions regarding expanding LEAD to other King County cities. \" This refers to individuals who meet the Familiar Faces threshold of four or more bookings into the County's jails in a year. Page 3 of 6 27 of290MIDD 2 Service lmprovement plan lnitiative Description - preliminary lmplementation lnformation Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (CD_1) Specific outcomes and measures for LEAD, especially identification of what will beevaluated as part of MIDD 2, are subject to further deiinition. 0 E.

Funding for community engagement, project management including accountability toMIDD and other oversight bodies, and stakeholdertoordination wo-uld be directed to thePublic Defender Association (pDA). Funding for case management will be contracted to PDA through King County BHRD,which will provide program oversight of and contract monitoring for th\u00e9 MIDD-fundedportion of LEAD, including ensuring that other funding sourceJ\u00a1ncluding Medicaid aremaximized. (See 3.A below for the expected long-term approach to ca\u00fa management contracting.) 2. Spending Plan This spending plan shows estimated amounts and expected categories for MIDD 2,srecommended contribution to LEAD. It is designed to invest in expansion of LEAD to other jurisdictions, and/or other Seatfleneighborhoods, as part of a countywide strategy. Eac\u00f1 additional jurisdiction will beexpected to secure or contribute funding for increased case management, project management, community engagement, client legal services, law enforcement overtime,and training costs when LEAD expands into its \u00e1rea, alongside the MIDD 2 investment. All expenses shown are provisional and may be adjusted depending on the timing ofexpansion of LEAD into other communities within Seattle and/or throughout the County. As noted earlier in the Service lmprovement Plan, the county recognizes that it is notalways possible to begin spending on all MIDD initiatives as soon \u00e3s budget authority isgranted. This initiative is among a group of programs expected to be impl\u00e3mented via astaged approach, to allow for thoughtful planning and procurement processes. This isreflected in the spending plan below via differeni expenditure amounts for the first andsecond years of the 2Ol7-1g bienn\u00edum.I 8406Appendix H Page 6 Appendix H MIDD 2 Service lmprovement Plan lnitiative Description - Preliminary lmplementation Information Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (CD-1) 3. lmplementation Schedule 0 A. Procurement of Providers County funds will be granted to Public Defender Association (PDA) to support its existing role in project management, stakeholder coordination and community engagement for LEAD, including its role in working with the multisystem LEAD Policy Coordinating Group, the consensus-based governing body of LEAD that includes PDA, prosecutors, law enforcement, the King County Executive's Office, and municipal funders. Funding for LEAD case management will administered by the through a Memorandum of Agreement between PDA and King County BHRD, which will provide program oversight of and contract monitoring for the MIDD-funded portion of LEAD. It is the long{erm goal for LEAD that King County BHRD oversee the contract for case management services and oversee the social services aspect of LEAD, including behavioral health, primary care and housing. This will occur when BHRD-administered \"on demand\" referral portals are available featuring harm reduction and trauma-informed care approaches. lf new King County cities wish to launch LEAD, an RFP would be developed by BHRD staff in conjunction with the Policy Coordinating Group in order to identify case management providers appropriate to those new cities. 0 B.

How does the program advance the recommended MIDD policy goals? This program primarily addresses the recommended MIDD policy goal of \"explicit linkage with, and furthering the work of, other King County and community initiatives.\" This program is a coordinated apprgach to supporting youth and young adults experiencing homelessness. lt provides mobile behavioral health team(s) to young adult housing programs as featured in the All Home Comprehensive Plan to Prevent and End Youth and Young Adult (YYA) Homelessness. This approach is also consistent with the principles of King County's plans for behavioral health integration and health and human services transformation, which call for reduced fragmentation across systems, increased flexibility of services and coordination of care, and strong emphasis on prevention, recovery and elimination of disparities for marginalized populations. 1. Program Description 0 A. Servrce Components/Design (Brief) Mental health and/or chemical dependency professionals will be embedded within an existing agency or agencies providing housing in Seattle, East King County, and/or South King County and shared across all young adult (YA) housing programs, including transitional housing, rapid rehousing, and permanent housing. lf more than one team is created, each team would serve an identified geographic region. These staff will provide on-site, timely mental health and chemical dependency screenings and assessment, brief intervention, and connection to ongoing behavioral health services. Because these team(s) will be based at existing housing programs, the \"home base\" programs will have stronger capacity to provide intensive on-site behavioral health supports. This will create more appropriate supports within existing housing programs for young adults with ongoing mental health or substance abuse needs. lt is anticipated that these programs will be able to stabilize more young people, and support them moving to other programs in the continuum as their service needs change. 0 B. Goals This initiative focuses on mobile behavioral health team(s) based in young adult housing programs, as a priority element of a coordinated approach that will support youth and young adults experiencing homeless with acute behavioral health needs and/or a history Page 1 of 3 31 o'f 2901 8406Appendix H MIDD 2 Service lmprovement Plan lnitiative Description - Preliminary lmplementation lnformation Youth and Young Adult Homelessness Services (CD-2) of trauma in achieving and succeeding in safe and stable housing.l lmproving behavioral health services to this population will help ensure that their homelessness is \u00e1 brief and one-time experience. 0 C.

This initiative impacts the recommended MIDD policy goal of \"divert individuals with behavioralhealth needs from costly interventions, such as jail, emergency rooms, and hospitals.,' This program relates to the current MIDD 1 strategy Adult Crisis Diversion Center, Respite Bedsand Mobile Behavioral Health Crisis Team in the \u00e1vailability of in-the-community crisis iesponseand the- accessibility of a facility-based crisis diversion program. The program would provi\u00e0esouth King County first responders with a therapeutic community-based \u00e3lternative to jail andhospital settings when engaging with adult individuals in behavioral health crisis. 1. Program Description 0 A. Seryice Components/Design (Brief) The South County Crisis Center (SCCC) is envisioned provide crisis services thesouthern region of King County serving individuals in behavioral health crisis who arecoming into contact with first responders, as well as those individuals in South KingCounty who may need a location for preventative and pre-crisis support and/or outreach.This allows for potential co-locati'on and coordination of many crisi\u00e9 receiving and stabilization services accessible 24 hours a day, seven days per week eafij, including but not limited to: on-site respite/crisis diversion and mobile crisis team\u00f2. 0 B. Goals The goals of the programs at the SCCC would be to meet the individual where theyare, rather than expecting the individual to be ready for services, housing, etc. The recovery aspect would be indicated in the expectation that the SCCC wii work withindividuals on a repeat basis in order to work on motivation for treatment, while alsofocusing their efforts on addressing what is important for the individual. Without basicneeds being met, individuals will likely be moving from crisis to crisis, rather than moving down a. path of recovery. By setting the focus on identifying and addressingthe most pressing needs - such as obtaining identification, oOt\u00e1ini\u00f1g health benefi[s, completing housing applications, etc. - the facility will be able to taf\u00e9 the extra steps to ensure an individual has access to services and the support they need to help themmaintain stabilization. 0 C.

How does the program advance the recommended MIDD policy goals? This initiative primarily addresses the recommended MIDD policy goal of \"divert individuals with behavioral health needs from costly interventions, such as jail, emergency rooms, and hospitals.\" There are an estimated 23,000 people who use drugs by injection in King County.l Of clients seen at Public Health - Seattle and King County's Needle Exchange Program, 89 percent report having used heroin in the last three months, and 47 percent of these heroin users report being \"hooked on prescription-type opiates\" before they started using heroin.2 Accelerating opiate use has been documented by increased treatment admits, increased heroin overdose deaths, an increase in heroin evidence tested by the State Crime Lab, and increased use of prescription- type opioids by 1Oth grade students.3 Heroin involved overdose deaths in King County increased from 49 individuals in 2009 to 156 individuals in2014, the highest numberever recorded.4 The volume of syringes exchanged in King County in 2015 topped seven million, almost a four-fold increase in ihe last ten years, and an increase of 18 percent comparedlo 2014. While capacity for Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) has increased in King County, it has not kept pace with need: the number of treatment admissions for heroin in King County doubled between 2010 and 2014 and increased 32 percent from 2013 (2,187 admits) lo 2014 (2,886).4 This initiative aims to address the trend by supporting the recommendations (due end of September 2016) of the Heroin and Prescription Opioid Addiction Task Force, jointly convened by the King County Executive and the mayors of Seattle, Auburn, and Renton.5 Specifically, recommended interventions in as many as five categories may emerge from the work of the Task Force: 1.

Program Description 0 A. Service Components/Design (Brief) Although Task Force recommendations are not yet known, potential services could beimplemented in five categories being considered by the Task Force and may include thefollowing. Examples of potential interventions are described for each category. Category 1: Expanded treatment on demand for office-based MAT.o Offer multiple frequent induction points including needle exchange, jails, and detoxification facilities, community health centers, and behaviora-l h\u00e9alth providers, including centralized coordination of service availability. Category 2: Primary prevention efforts, possibly including targeted educational campaigns.o Pilot educational campaigns to pediatric and adolescent medical providers regarding opioid prescribing and educating families on the role of opioids in medical treatment.o Other primary prevention efforts may emerge but have not yet been defined. category 3: lncreased access to overdose reversal drug naloxone to prevent fatalities and problem escalation.o Recipients of publicly funded treatment for opioid use disorder or needle exchange services, and those in their social and familial networks, may be enrolled in an overdose education and take-home-Naloxone program. Category 4: Continuation of MIDD 1-funded engagement services to link clients ofPHSKC's needle exchange to needed treatment services.o Social work staff at PHSKC's needle exchange. category 5: staffing support for a supervised consumption site in King county.o Services will include MAT with buprenorphine, and will be staffed in p\u00e5rt ny a nurse care manager. 6 Such programs are often referred to as ,,safe injection facilities.,'a a a a a Page 2 of 4 38 of 2901 8406 Appendix H MIDD 2 lmplementation lnformation Multipronged Opioid Strategies (CD-7) 0 B. Goals Broad goals of this initiative include reduced heroin or opioid-linked overdose fatalities, and an improved continuum of health care services, treatment, and supports for opioid users in King County. 0 C. Expected Numbers of lndividuals Served The social work staff at PHSKC under category 4 serves 700 clients per year, refers 300 clients per year to MAT, and successfully places 200 clients in treatment. Targets for the number of individuals to be served by categories 1, 2,3, and 5 of this initiative - or other categories to be determined - will be set once Task Force recommendations are finalized. As the initiative's varied approaches are likely to yield interventions across the continuum of care, some potential interventions may come into contact with many people, while others may have a more focused impact on a smaller number of participants. 0 D. Draft Outcomes and Performance Measures - outcomes and measures are expected to be revised and included in the MIDD 2 Evaluation Plan. This initiative contributes to population outcomes of the MIDD 2 Framework, including. reduced/eliminatedsubstanceuse. reduced jail, hospital, and emergency department use The following individual-level outcome measures (MIDD 2 Framework language used where applicable) for program participants may include:. increased use of preventive (outpatient) services. reduction of crisis events. improved wellness and social relationships. reduced hospitalization, emergency department use, and incarceration. improvedwellnessself-management 0 E.

How does the program advance the recommended MIDD policy goals? This program primarily addresses the recommended MIDD policy goal of \"reduce the number, length, and frequency of behavioral health crisis events.\" ln communities where Behavioral Health Urgent Care Walk-ln Clinics (BHUCCs) exist, people have rapid access to behavioral health services and supports, including peer specialists, to avert the need for more intensive crisis response by law enforcement, involuntary detention authorities, EDs, and inpatient hospitals. BHUCCs are available to intervene earlier, and to offer alternatives that prevent future destabilization. They promote hope and recovery, and offer skills to promote resilience. BHUCCs are an innovative system improvement and operate in coordination with all other components of a community's continuum of crisis services. 1, Program Description 0 A. Seruice Components/Design (Brief) The King County BHUCCI is envisioned to serve adults who are experiencing a behavioral health crisis and in need of immediate assistance. The Clinic.would be as centrally located as possible and accessible via public transportation. lndividuals may self-refer by coming directly to the Clinic during established business hours including evenings. Other referral avenues may be developed. No appointments would be necessary. As funding permits, services available at the King County BHUCC may include: . Help with coping skills and crisis resolution planning;. Support from peer recovery specialists who bring hope to others on their recovery journeys;. Access to crisis psychiatry as necessary;. Crisis stabilization services, as needed, for up to.30 days;. lntake/referral for crisis residential services;. Substance use disorder screening and referral;. Family education and support;.

How does the program advance the recommended MIDD policy goals? This program primarily addresses the recommended MIDD policy goal of \"divert individuals with behavioral health needs from costly interventions, such as jail, emergency rooms, and hospitals.\" This funding will enable Harborview Medical Center (HMC) to provide local triage evaluations for individuals with severe and persistent mental illness who have been charged with a serious misdemeanor offense and are found not competent to assist in their own defense and not able to be restored to competency to stand trial. This will enable Designated Mental Health Professionals (DMHPs), dispatched from King County Crisis and Commitment Services (CCS), who currently provide these evaluations, to respond more efficiently to a significant volume of initial referrals for involuntary treatment evaluation services under RCW 71.05 (the civil lnvoluntary Treatment Act). This triage project also ensures full compliance with the process outlined in RCW 10.77 , as HMC can evaluate each person for a 90-day civil commitment, unlike DMHPs who may only evaluate for an initial 72-hour detention. 1. Program Description O A. Seryice Components/Design (Briet) The HMC evaluator (who is a licensed clinical social worker) receives the court order to evaluate the person in jail within a 72-hour window. lf the person is deemed to not meet the threshold for civil commitment, the HMC evaluator develops a safe plan for release in coordination with outside providers and release planners, and petitions the judge for release of the person to the community. lf the person is determined to meet the legal threshold for civil commitment under Chapter 71 .05 RCW (the lnvoluntary Treatment Act),1 the evaluator (along with a provider) will file a petition for a 90-day more restrictive order. ln coordination with the County and local Evaluation and Treatment (E&T) facilities, the person is placed in the appropriate local E&T for inpatient psychiatric treatment. 1 Mental lllness and lnvoluntary Treatment Act statute: http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCWdefault.aspx?cite=71.05. Page 1 of 3 47 of29OI 8406Appendix H MIDD 2 Service lmprovement plan lnitiative Description - Preliminary Implementation lnformation lnvoluntary Treatment Triage (CD-14) 0 B. Goals This initiative will ensure that incarcerated individuals with mental illness who may not be competent and not restorable receive the appropriate level of care locally. Specifically, if these individuals do not require hospitalization, they will be connected w\u00ecth appropriate outpatient services to address their primary and mental healthcare needs. This initiative provides a more robust continuum and coordination of care with a more thorough assessment of the individuals' needs and strong linkage to services either from jail or once discharged from the E&T. By keeping individuals in local treatment facilities (vs. WSH) for the initial treatment, there is a decrease in the number of patients being placed on long term court orders and in turn a decrease in placements to WSH. Lasly, this triage project seeks to avoid the unnecessary use of emergency departments, by providing the initial evaluation in the jail. C. Expected Numbers of lndividuals Served Based on the unfunded RCW 10.77 evaluation volume currently handled by King County's DMHPs, it is estimated that between 200 and 250 individuals per year may receive evaluations through this program once funded. ln coordination with court partners, efforts will also be made to reduce the number of evaluations that are needed 0 D. Draft Outcomes and Performance Measures - outcomes and measures are expected to be revised and included in the MIDD 2 Evaluation plan.

How does the program advance the recommended MIDD policy goals? This initiative will impact the recommended MIDD policy goal of \"Reduce the number, length, and frequency of behavioral health crisis events\". The young adult homeless system has seen a dramatic increase in transition aged youth with serious behavioral health needs. ln recent months, there have been two suicides, and several attempted suicides by young, homeless people who are experiencing their first psychotic break. There have been multiple other incidents of high needs young people in homeless housing or shelter situations that were not intended or suited to serve youth with these high needs. This program will provide community based treatment beds to stabilize these transition-aged youth, or to house youth in crisis on a transitional basis, including those who are exiting from involuntary commitment facilities. lnitially, the focus will be on young people who are in homeless housing or shelter situations, but will be expanded to be available to a broader group of transitioned-aged youth to avert more significant crises. Although transition-aged youth are legally considered adults, existing adult facilities are not developmentally appropriate to serve this age group. The treatment beds supported by this funding will address a serious gap in the current behavioral health and housing systems for these transition aged youth. Program treatment services will be offered to stabilize individuals and mitigate further trauma for an already vulnerable population. 1. Program Description 0 A. Service Components/Design (Brief) This program must be developed collaboratively with stakeholders and communities.

How does the program advance the recommended M\\DD poticy goats? This program primarily addresses the recommended MIDD policy goal of \"reduce the number,length, and frequency of behavioral health crisis events.', Zero Suicidel is built on the foundational understanding that suicide deaths are preventable. The Zero Suicide lnitiative is the beginning of a comprehensive suicide preventi\u00f6n strategy/planfor King County, and will be a new approach for suicide prevention for the region. Suicide is a major public health problem. ln Washington State, suicide is the eighth leadingcause of death overall and the second leading cause of death among young pebple ages \u00ecs-SS.ln King County, there are roughly 250 deaths by suicide every year. f\u00f3r eu\u00f5ry sri.\u00a10\", \u00a1t \u00a1testimated that 25 attempts are made, some requiring expensive emergency room and hospitalvisits. For every suicide death, it is estimated that six friends and famiy m\u00e9mbers of thedeceased will struggle with this particularly devastating and complicate\u00e2 form of grief for the restof their lives.2 Zero Suicide will involve a multi-stage project where the public health and behavioral healthsystems serving adults with serious mental illnesses will be supported in adopting a specific setof strategies, tools and training to transform these systems to eliminate patient s\u00e3f\"ty f\"ilrr\".and to close gaps in depression and suicide care. Zero suicide is a key concept in healthcarethat is contained in the 2012 National strategy for suicide prevention.\u00ed 1. Program Description 0 A. Seruice Components/Design (Brief) The Zero Suicide lnitiative is designed envisioning three phases as funding permits: ' Phase 1: King County behavioral health and health care system - prov\u00edder and county system (DCHS and Public Health) and trainings/development; ' Phase 2: Hospital and Healthcare systems participating in Screening, Brief lntervention and Referralto Treatment (SBIRT), to the\u00e3egree fundi\u00f1g permits; ' Phase 3_: Remaining Hospital, Behavioral Health and Healthcare systems, to the degree funding permits. Additional community trainings may be included as funding allows. Zero Suicide approach implementation includes the following components: t http:i/zerosuicide,sprc. org/about - im i I I nformation Zero Suicide lnitiative Pilot (PRl-6) 1. ldentify sources of data that can be improved and analyzed to assess the extent of suicidal behavior occurring within King County's public behavioral health care system and primary care system and, to put into place a reporting system on suicidal behavior. 2. Analyze provider contracts to recommend changes to incentivize Zero Suicide approaches within contracted agencies.3. Determine a Zero Suicide implementation provider agency and work to determine and select the first cohort of the provider agencies, who are determined to be ready based on a base-line assessment, to begin work viaZero Suicide grants. 4. Provide intensive training and technical assistance to the first cohort of contracted provider agencies to implemenl a Zero Suicide approach.5. Establish a Zero Suicide learning collaborative comprised of implementation teams from each agency. Each team will develop a strategic plan for their work over the next two years and a cross-agency learning collaborative will be established.6. Provide technical assistance to each agency. Many training opportunities for agency staff will be provided to the learning collaborative of participating contracted agencies over the two-year period. 7. Continued rollout to additional cohorts of contracted providers annually, and then expand to phase 2 and 3 sites as funding permits. The Zero Suicide lnitiative may also include many of the following components. Prioritization of these components will be determined in consultation with suicide prevention partners and other stakeholders:8. Lethal means restriction training, including exploration of options for means restrictions programming implementation (e.9. implementation of recommendations from the Washington State Safer Homes Task Force);L Suicide attempt follow up care program when released from Emergency Department or inpatient settings (including development of a model-based emerging best practice); 10. Universal and proper implementation of suicide risk screening at Emergency Departments (coupled with brief interventions, discharge planning and follow up); and 11. Programming for families/friends who have lost someone to suicide. 12. Universal gatekeeper suicide prevention training. 13. A social marketingimedia outreach plan. 14. Partnership with Mental Health First Aid training for stigma reduction. Stakeholders and partners will be consulted to design and implement the pilot. 0 B. Goals Through this initiative's training and technical assistance efforts, the following seven elements of suicide prevention care for health and behavioral systems would gradually be adopted by behavioral health and physical health care providers, and become a new best practice standard for publicly funded care in King Countya. 4 Adapted from the Zero Suicide Toolkit at http://zerosuicide.sprc.orq/toolkit Page 2 of 4 57 of2901 8406Appendix H MIDD 2 Service lmprovement plan lmplementation lnformation Zero Pitot (pRl-6) Lead - create a leadership-driven, safety-oriented culture committed to dramatically reducing suicide among people under care. lnclude survivors of suicide attempts and suicide loss in leadership and planning roles. Train - Develop a competent, confident, and caring workforce. Train all staff commensurate with their potential role in suicide prevention. ldentify - Systematically identify and assess (screening and assessment) suicide risk among people receiving care. Engage - Ensure every individual has a pathway to care that is both timely and adequate to meet their needs. lnclude collaborative safety planning and restriction of lethal means. Treat - Use effective, evidence-based treatments that directly target suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Transition - Provide continuous contact and support, especially after acute care. Utilize peers who are in behavioral health recovery who also experience suicidal behaviors to help support those who are at-risk. lmprove - Apply a data-driven quality improvement approach to inform system changes that will lead to improved patient outcomes and better care for those at risk. Additional goals include effective implementation of Suicide Prevention components across King County. 0 C. Expected Numbers of lndividuals Served Each annual provider cohort is expected to include several agencies, each of which will identify implementation teams to pioneer Zero Suicide approaches within their organizations. The number of potential clients who could benefit from the resulting enhanced services provided by these teams is indeterminate and likely to vary by agency.

Many people in socleiy remain ignorant orfearful about the signs and symptoms of mental illnesses,2 aittrougtr society has a rolelhroughresponsible community members to help people experiencing the\u00e9e illness\u00eas. The symptom\u00e9 ofmental illness can be difficult to detect - even when friends \u00e3nd family of someone whoappears to be developing a mental illness can tell that something is amiss, they may not knowhow to intervene or direct the person to proper treatment - whic\u00f1 means that t\u00f1ose in need ofmental health services do not get them untilthey require emergency medical intervention. lf thegreater community has a better understanding of psychiatric c\u00f5nditions, then more people willfeel both competent and equipped to help pe\u00f3ple ln itre\u00a1r communities. lf mental illness isdestigmatized, more people willfeel comfortable asking for and receiving help earlier in theprocess' This will improve the overall health of the population and prom\u00f5te ilellness in theregion. Mental Health First Aid is an 8-hour training course that gives people the skills to help someone ltho is developing a mental health problem or experiencing a mental health crisis. Mental HealthFirst Aid would be available to a variety of audiences, including: health and human servicesworkers; employers and business leaders; faith community leaders; college and university staffand faculty; law enforcement and public safety officials; veterans and fam'\u00cdly members; personswith mental illness-substance use disorders and their families; and other c\u00e1ring citizens. Theevidence behind the program demonstrates that it does build mental health lite-racy, helping thepublic identify, understand, and respond to signs of mental illness. lt also helps re\u00e1uce stigmarelated to behavioral health conditions. Just as CPR training helps a person with no clinical training assist an individual following a heartattack, Mental Health First Aid training helps a person assiit someone experiencing a mentalhealth crisis such as contemplating suicide. ln both situations, the goal is to help s\u00f9pport anindividual until appropriate professionalhelp arrives. Mental Health First Aid trainees learn asingle S-step strategy that includes assessing risk, respectfully listening to and supporting theindividual in crisis, and identifying appropriate professional heip and other supports. participants are also introduced to risk factors and warning signs for mental health or subbtance useproblems, engage in experiential activities that build understanding of the impact of illness on 1 Any Mental lllness (AMl) Among Adults.

Mental Health First Aid is intended for all people and organizations that make up the fabric of a community.3 1. Program Description 0 A. Seruice Components/Design (Brief) The Mental Health First Aid training initiative service components will include a combination of direct Mental Health First Aid trainings and \"train the trainer\" courses, with the numbers of each type of training to be determined by community capacity and interest. The Mental Health First Aid course runs eight hours and may be offered in a variety of formats (Adult & Youth). Most often, it is provided in one day, or in two 4-hour sessions spaced over a short period of time. ln addition, offering S-day train the trainer courses in Mental Health First Aid, thereby increasing training capacity within the County, will also increase the likelihood that people in a number of different communities will learn about Mental Health First Aid. The specifics of the service components will be created in partnership with individuals in King County currently trained in Mental Health First Aid and others who are interested in becoming Mental Health First Aid trainers, in consultation with the Mental Health First Aid training developers. The service components will be coordinated by King County DCHS' Behavioral Health and Recovery Division, and the specifics of service delivery and implementation will be based on community input, readiness, and demand. At the beginning stages of implementation, currently trained facilitators can conduct a certain number of trainings in their geographic areas and collect required evaluation data. ln addition, current King County providers will be consulted about their willingness and capacity to have staff trained as facilitators. Other entities such as school districts and law enforcement agencies will be surveyed about their interest in hosting or attending these trainings. 0 8. Goals Having more people throughout the county who become knowledgeable about psychiatric conditions will ultimately reduce stigma for individuals with these conditions. Giving more people in the community the basic tools to recognize and respond to emergent mental health crises will increase the likelihood of useful interventions from a person' s natural support system during a behavioral health crisis. 0 C. Expected Numbers of lndividuals Served Given current funding levels and national estimates of average costs of Mental Health First Aid training per person, as many as 2,000 people per year could be served if only direct 3Mental Health FirstAid FrequentlyAsked Questions.

Costs are variable, depending on the number of individuals trained, and the numbers of trainings offered. The potential reach of the MIDD investment could be broadened through the strategic use of\"train the trainer\" certification courses that could create lasting impact beyond the MIDD funding. However, the higher up-front cost of these trainingsa would decrease the total number of trainees funded directly by MIDD. The relative number of direct trainings versus certification courses that would be offered by through this MIDD initiative will be determined via the community-informed design process outlined above. 0 D.

How does the program advance the recommended MIDD policy goals? This program primarily addresses the recommended MIDD policy goal of \"divert individuals with behavioral health needs from costly interventions, such as jail, emergency rooms, and hospitals.\" lndividuals who experience behavioral health issues have increased rates of incarceration.l Some jurisdictions in the U.S. have been able to reduce rates of recidivism for individuals who experience behavioral health issues through the complete application of evidence-based practices with fidelity, of which risk and need assessment is foundational.2 The implementation of the comprehensive risk and needs assessment of incarcerated individuals in King County will guide case management and appropriate services placement, and will position King County Department of Adult and Juvenile Detention (DAJD) and the King County Community Corrections Division (CCD) to partner with providers in an effort to reduce recidivism consistent with national best practices. The first step in this work is the development and implementation of a validated needs assessment platform in King County.3 At present, a King county cross-system criminaljustice and behavioral health work teama is working with the Washington State University Criminal Justice lnstitute to develop a comprehensive jurisdictional needs assessment tool for King County that, when applied countywide, will not only identify the likelihood of re-offense but will specifically categorize the criminogenic needs of the individual. This initiative supports implementation of a behavioral health risk assessment instrument in King County's adult correctional facilities. l Steadman, HJ, Osher, FC, Robbins, PC, Case, B, Samuels S. \"Prevalence of Serious Mental lllnessAmong Jail lnmates.\" Psychiatric 60, Desy(July2015).

How does the program advance the recommended MIDD policy goals? This program primarily addresses the recommended MIDD policy goal of \"improve health and wellness of individuals living with behavioral health conditions.\" The nonprofit Recovery Caf\u00e9 provides an alternative therapeutic supportive community for women and men traumatized by homelessness, addiction and other mental health challenges Operating for over 10 years, Recovery Caf\u00e9 has helped thousands of women and men find stability and support on their recovery journey. MIDD 2's annual investment, in combination with operating and capitalfunding from other sources, would allow a second location in King County to be launched. The alternative therapeutic model used at Recovery Caf\u00e9 provides support, resources and a community of care along the entire continuum of a person's need for recovery assistance. ln crisis, newer to recovery, in long-term recovery, after a relapse, during a difficult life change, or mental health transition, Recovery Caf\u00e9 is a refuge of care and evidence-based addiction support. Recovery Caf\u00e9 provides a community in which women and men can stabilize in their mental/physical health, housing, relationships, and employmenVvolunteer service. This community helps women and men fulfill their potential and live meaningful lives. Recovery Caf\u00e9 teaches people ways to manage their mental health, maintain sobriety, and build mutually supportive community. Through its work, Recovery Caf\u00e9 prevents individuals from potentially lethal crises, avoiding the need for emergency intervention to stabilize that person, and allowing mental health and addiction support professionals to focus on health maintenance and additional harm reduction. Recovery Caf\u00e9 has been recognized by Washington State and King County experts as an example of how a Recovery Oriented System of Care (ROSC) works.l t ROSC is a fairly new approach that the Washington State Division of of Behavioral Health and Recovery and King County have embraced. A ROSC is a more effective approach for addressing substance use disorder (SUD) issues than traditional models, because it meets people where they are on the recovery continuum, engages them for a lifetime of managing their disease, focuses holistically on a person's needs, and empowers them to build a life that realizes their full potential. This person-centered system of care supports a person as they establish a healthy life and recognizes that everyone needs a meaningful sense of membership and belonging in community.

How does the program advance the recommended MIDD policy goals? This program primarily addresses the recommended MIDD policy goal of \"divert individuals with behavioral health conditions from costly interventions, such as jail, emergency rooms, and hospitals.\" Specifically, through its two program components, the initiative provides:. transition supports for adult individuals who have been hospitalized in inpatient psychiatric units by supporting peer bridger programs that have been shown to be effective in reducing hospital episodes and lengths of stay; reducing rehospitalization; and increasing Medicaid enrollment; andr p\u00ea\u00ear specialists strategically deployed to substance use disorder (SUD) service settings where peers' unique experiences and skills can have a significant impact on participants' ability to maintain recovery by supporting them to engage successfully with ongoing treatment services and other supports. These peer services are criticalto diverting people from criminaljustice and emergency medical settings. 1. Program Description 0 A. Seruice Components/Design (Brief) The initiative includes two discrete but related components: MIDD support for the Peer Bridger programs at Navos Mental Health Solutions and Harborview Mental Health and Addiction Services, and a pilot to support the strategic use of peer services in settings serving individuals with elevated or emergent substance use needs and risks. Peer Bridqer Component The Peer Bridger programs provide transition supports for adult individuals who have been hospitalized at the psychiatric inpatient units at Navos and Harborview.l Teams of certified peer specialists work in coordination with the inpatient treatment teams to identify individuals in need of this support, and to develop individualized plans to promote each person's successful transition to the community. ' The Peer Bridger Program was originally fu nded in the spring of 2013 by a grant from the State of Washington Attorney General's Office, Consumer Protection Division, from proceeds associated with a class action lawsuit. Those grant funds were exhausted in December 2015. MIDD fund balance dollars were provided to sustain the current program through 2016. Page 1 of 5 75 of 2901 8406 0Appendix H MIDD 2 Service lmprovement Plan Initiative Description - Preliminary lmplementation lnformation Peer Bridgers and peer Support pilot (RR-11) Peer Bridgers work with individuals for up to 90 days after discharge. Participants are offered: ' concrete support to obtain personal identification documents, medical insurance benefits, housing, treatment services, medications, social supports, transportation, cell phones, and other basic necessities'o one-to-one and group seryices during hospitalization;. support for wellness self-management using evidence-based tools, and. an authentic personal connection based on personalexperience. lf this aspect of the initiative is expanded in future years, peer bridger services could expand to serve additional psychiatric units in King County's other evaluation and treatment faci lities and/or comm unity hospitals. SUD Peer Suppoft Component SUD peers are people with lived experience who have initiated their recovery journey and are able and willing to assist others who are earlier in the recovery process. They can have a unique role in the provision of recovery support services inc\u00eduding access to evidence-based practices such as supported employment, education, and h\u00f5using; assertive community treatment; and illness management. Peers can also play a k\u00e9y role in helping people engage successfully with formal SUD treatment. Peer support removes barriers to access and is invaluable throughout the continuum of care, prioi io treatment, during treatment, and as after-care support. Peer specialist staff will be deployed to serve in two stand-alone recovery community organizations (RCos) that have been strong leaders in developing a peer to peer infrastructure in King.County. At RCOs, peer positions build conn\u00e8ctions wi\u00dbr recoveringpeople, helping link them to community support and providing emotional assistance totheir recovery journey. Additional peer specialist staff will be deployed to unique location(s) where effectivepeer interventions are most likely to prevent, reduce, or shorten emergency system use. This may include such settings as the Dutch Shisler Sobering Center,-th\u00e1 public Health Seattle-King County (PHSKC) needle exchange, current oi future detoxification facilities, and/or other environments where SUD peeistaff can have an especially significant impact on criminal justice system involvement. The anticipated expansion of the pilot in future years could establish peer services more broadly in suD treatment agencies, including outpatient, withdrawal management, and residential settings, in accordance with a broader vision to expandpeer support in SUD treatment. The remainder of this document describes expected SUD peer support services and expenditures at the pilot level only. B. Goals Peer Bridqer Component The primary goal of the Peer Bridger Programs is to promote successful community tenure for the identified population. System goals include: reductions in King County Page 2 of 5 76 of 2901 8406 Appendix H MIDD 2 Prel im i nary lm plementation I nformation Peer Bridgers and Peer Support Pilot (RR-11) funded inpatient admissions, readmissions, and hospital days. The program prioritizes services for the most vulnerable of hospitalized individuals:. people who are not insured and not enrolled in ongoing mental health services; and. people who are insured and enrolled, but disengaged from their ongoing mental health provider and at high risk of re-hospitalization. SUD Peer Support Component The SUD peer support component in its current pilot phase will aim to deploy a small number of peers to assist individuals, with a goal of reducing their recurring use of emergency systems, including the criminal justice system. As would be the case if the pilot were expanded more broadly, these peers willwork to facilitate effective linkage and engagement with ongoing treatment services in the recovery community, outpatient treatment services, withdrawal management, and/or residential settings. 0 C. Expected Numbers of lndividuals Served Peer Bridger Component The Peer Bridger programs at Navos and Harborview currently together serve approximately 200 individuals per year. rt Comnen The number of individuals to be served by the SUD peer support pilot component will depend on the service setting(s) and role(s) selected. 0 D. Draft Outcomes and Performance Measures - outcomes and measures are expected to be revised and included in the MIDD 2 Evaluation Plan. Both components of this initiative contribute to population outcomes of the MIDD 2 Framework, including:. emotional health. daily functioning. reduced substance use. reduced jail, hospital, and emergency department use The following individual-level outcome measures (MIDD 2 Framework language used where applicable) for program participants may include:. increased use of preventive (outpatient) services. reduced substance use. reduced behavioral health risk factors. reduction of crisis events. reduced hospitalization, emergency department use, and incarceration Page 3 of 5 77 o'f 2901 8406Appendix H MIDD 2 Service lmprovement plan lnitiative Description - preliminary lmplementation lnformation Peer Bridgers and peer Support pilot (RR-11) 0 E.

How does the program advance the recommended MIDD policy goals? This program primarily addresses the recommended MIDD policy goal of \"increase culturally appropriate, trauma informed behavioral health services'\" By directly empowering communities to design service approaches that meet their needs, this inltiative ieeks to over\u00f0ome barriers to behavioral health service participation and recovery that ethnic and cultural communities experience. Such barriers include: . Underutilization and premature termination of behavioral health treatment despite continued need;. Disproportionately higher burden from unmet mental health needs; . Poorer-quality care;. Mistrust of the behavioral health system resulting from the cultural insensitivity of treating clinicians;. Lack of culturally appropriate services including bilingual and bicultural staff; r Collectivist cultural values that may make the individualistic process of psychotherapy foreign;. Varying conceptions of the nature, causes, and cures of behavioral health conditions; . Perceptions of stigma and shame; and. Lack of health insurance coverage.' ln King County, as in many ethnic and cultural minority communities nationwide, people are left primar\u00ecly with -behavioral health service options that do not fit their cultural needs, so they iemain unserved or underserved. These findings about ethnic communities' preferences around service delivery were confirmed locally via MlDD community engagement, including community conversations, focus groups, and surveys.2 This initiative provides a structure and resources for communities to propose projects and receive funding to address community needs using culturally appropriate programs. t Leong and Kalibatseva (2011 ).

Procurement of Providers This initiative will require periodic, low-barrier requests for proposals (RFPs) - no less frequently than annually - to facilitate the selection of time-limited community-driven projects for funding. The level of complexity and requirements for these proposals will vary depending on the amount of the funding request. Multiple categories will be created in accordance with contracting requirements, in order to ease access for small organizations and small projects. This will include reducing barriers such as insurance and data submission requirement, and technical support as needed. The specifics of these categories are described in section B below. Applicant organizations will be expected to demonstrate that they have leveraged matching contributions.6 Matching funds may come in the form of funding from- other sources or donated time, space, or other in-kind resources. Combining all sources (including in-kind), the match must total at least 25 percent of the MlDb funding request in the first year, and at least 50 percent in the second and/or third years (if app\u00cdcable). B. Contracting of Servlces An annual request for proposals process would be established to provide a predictable timing and process by which communities could request funds. Organizations selected for funding via this community-driven grant initiative would establish contracts or monitoring agreements with King County covering each proposed program or service and its associated time period. Criteria for limited renewal of the projects will be developed, up to a limit of three years of funding per project or service. Factors to be considered the decision to renew funding for a project or service may include: (1)the volume of people served; (2) community feedback about project effectiveness and engagement/organizing work; and (3) Efforts to enroll project participants in Medicaid, as applicable. When renewed grants are sought for equivalent or substantively similar projects after the first year, funding will most commonly be renewed partially, at 50 percent t\u00f3 ZS percent of the initial year's amount, depending on the three factors above. The expectation is that other funding sources beyond MIDD will be leveraged to continue the service. u Match requirements are part of both the CSA small grant program afterwhich this initiative is modeled, and theCommunity Organizing Program small grant initiative previously operated by King County DCHS.

Oversight of expenditures of these grants, including organizations' internal controls, would be performed by County program management staff, allowing for funds to be disbursed either via small advance payments combined with reconciliation against actual expenditures or via simple expenditure reimbursement. Requests of $5.000 to $49,999 Funding requests from $5,000 to $49,999 per year per organization will be procured via formal annual County contracts. Every effort will be made to minimize administrative burdens associated with these contracts, including reduced fiscal auditing requirements Contracting requirements specific to particular funding levels are as follows: (1) For requests of $5,000 to $9,999, simplified contracting will be available, building on existing processes in place for contracting with providers for small special projects. (2) For requests of $10,000 to $49,999, full contracts will be requir\u00ead, but reduced insurance requirements may be available depending on the type of program or service proposed. Requests of $50,000 or Above Any requests of $50,000 or more per year per: organization are expected to be rare and would be required to demonstrate a high level of coordination and community engagement involving grassroots groups representing two or more cultural or ethnic communities. Projects at this level of funding would be required to comply with all standard County contracting rules including insurance and financial audit requirements commensurate with the funding level. 0 C. Servlces Start date (s) An outreach effort would begin in early 2017 to ensure that communities are aware of the existence of this new funding opportunity and to gather input about the operations and criteria for the initiative. lnformed by this engagement work, the first RFP could be issued in spring 2017 with services to begin in the third quarter 2017. New grants of $5,000 or more would be launched no less frequently than annually as each RFP cycle is completed, with grants of $4,999 and below issued quarterly or semiannually.

However, these efforts will depend on the number and amount-of funiding requests from each community. Also, as unique community needs may arise in certainareas at times, program procedures will be designed to allow flexibilityto shift resources accordingly when necessary. u some aspects of startup work for this initiative and the community-Driven Behavioral Health Grants for cultural andEthnic Communities initiative will be shared, so funding foroutreach, input-gathering, and process design is dividedbetween the two initiatives.

Procurement of Providers This initiative.will require periodic, low-barrier requests for proposals (RFPs) - no less frequently than annually - to facilitate the selection of time-limited community-driven projects for funding. The level of complexity and requirements for these proposals will vary depending on the amount of the funding request. Multiple categories will be created in accordance with contracting requirements, in order to ease access for small organizations and small projects. This will include reducing barriers such as insurance and data submission requirement, and technical support as needed. The specifics of these categories are described in section B below. Applicant organizations will be expected to demonstrate that they have leveraged matching contributions.t Matching funds may come in the form of funding from other sources or donated time, space, or other in-kind resources. Combining all sources (including in-kind), the match must total at least 25 percent of the MIDD funding request in the first year, and at least 50 percent in the second and/or third years (if applicable). 0 B. Contracting of Services An annual request for proposals process would be established to provide a predictable timing and process by which communities could request funds. Organizations selected for funding via this community-driven grant initiative would establish contracts or monitoring agreements with King County covering each proposed pr:ogram or service and its associated time period. Criteria for limited renewal of the projects will be developed, up to a limit of three years of funding per project or service. Factors to be considered the decision to renew funding for a project or service may include: (1)the volume of people served; (2) community feedback about project effectiveness and engagement/organizing work; and (3) Efforts to enroll project participants in Medicaid, as applicable. When renewed grants are sought for equivalent or substantively similar projects after the first year, funding will most commonly be renewed partially, at 50 percent to 75 percent of the initial year's amount, depending on the three factors above. The expectation is that other funding sources beyond MIDD will be leveraged to continue the service. Processes and requirements specific to particular funding levels, based on known procurement mandates and the overarching goals of the initiative, are outlined below. n Match requirements are part of both the CSA small grant program afterwhich this initiative is modeled, and the Community Organizing Program small grant initiative previously operated by King County DCHS.

This initiative will impact the recommended MIDD policy goal of \"divert individuals with behavioral health needs from costly interventions, such as jail, emergency rooms, and hospitals.\" Community-based outreach and engagement connect individuals in need of services prior to court involvement or as a treatment alternative. Many individuals do not enter into criminal justice system responses, such as specialty courts, when they have health and human service needs and often return to the streets after release from jail still in desperate need of connection to treatment, housing and community. 1. Program Description 0 A. Seruice Components/Design (Brief) Existing MIDD 1 services are provided under Public Health through two agencies: 1) Harborview Medical Center (HMC) in downtown Seattle and 2) the Valley Cities Counseling and Consultation (VCCC) in south and east King County, and known as the Bridges programl and through the Seattle lndian Health Board at the Dutch Shisler Service Center and the Chief Seattle Club. All provider agencies target individuals who have a recent history of cycling through hospitals, jails, other crisis facilities, psychiatric hospitals, or residential substance use disorder (SUD) treatment facilities. They work with individuals who do not have or are not eligible for Medicaid, and clients with mental health problems who are not eligible for enrollment in the Behavioral Health Organization (BHO) network that has provided publicly funded mental health services, or who are disconnected from their BHO case manager or program. The services are community-based mental health/SUD-based outreach, engagement and service linkages, including advocacy for individuals with mental health and substance use conditions, mental health assessments and linkage to counseling. County Administration/Oversight resources, Community-based organizations, and other experts will be engaged to use a collective impact approach, in order to assess current defined results and recommend any needs to redefine any determined results. This will include looking at population currently being served, to be served, accessibility, community need, etc. Public Health - Seattle and King County (PHSKC), King County Behavioral Health and Recovery Division (BHRD) and Housing & Community Development,; Harborview Medical Center (current provider), Valley Cities Counseling & Consultation (current provider), local homelessness advisory boards (e.9.

This program primarily addresses the recommended MIDD policy goal of \"divert individuals withbehavioral health needs from costly interventions, such as jail, emergency rooms, andhospitals.\" The initiative assists people in the midst of crisis by delivering flexible and individualized servicebeginning in the ED or hospital inpatient unit. This program builds on initial supportive contactto help people reintegrate safely into the community aft\u00e8r an immediate crisis, \u00e4nd help them toacquire and engage with stabilizing resources such as housing and communiiy-based care,thereby reducing future emergency system use. The program focuses.on reducing individuals' use of crisis services, including the emergency roo-m, inpatient psychiatry, and inpatient medical care; and enhancing the cipacity to linkindividuals to community services. The initiative serves people who a-re falling thr\u00f3ugh thecracks of the existing service system, such as people who have no services in place but needintensive outreach to connect to care, or people with mental illness who also have chronicmedical conditions.l l. Program Description \u00f6 A. Seryice Components/Design (Brief) This initiative will serve individuals who are frequently seen the emergency department(ED) or psychiatric emergency service (PES) at Harborview Medical \u00d3ent\u00e4r (HIVC). Funding will cover clinicians who will serve individuals that use the HMC ED or pES fouror more times in three months.2 Due to the intensity of service as well as the complexneeds of program individuals, caseloads are kept smaller, so people with eight or moreED or PES visits in six months will be prioritized, because they are most like\"ly to benefitfrom the services gffered by this specialized care team. The program also provides support for clients' basic needs that reduce barriers to participadng in the plan of carethrough a modest fund to address transportation, clothing, rent, and similar expenses. Newly available data from Washington's Emergency Department lnformation Exchange(EDIE) will also.be YTg^to identify-Harborview-pati\u00e9nts who may not meet the priority threshold based on HMC data alone, but have a high level of E\u00f3 use at other King County hospitals. 1 Harborview Medical Center, December 201S.2 Extracted from 2015 Harborview Medical Center Contract, Exhibit lV Page 1 of 3 '100 of 2901 8406 Appendix H MIDD Preliminary lmplementation lnformation High Utilizer Care Teams (CD-s) Most participants are homeless at the outset of the intervention. Along with homelessness, almost all individuals' vulnerability arises from at least two of the following: chronic medical issues, substance use disorders, and serious mental illness.3 Service components include a harm reduction approach to substance abuse, motivational strategies to engage individuals in primary healthcare for chronic conditions, active engagement of community supports, outreach during individuals' crises in the ED or during an inpatient admission, and continued engagement of individuals once they return to the community. Broadly, the team assists individuals to find stable housing, improves de-escalation skills to decrease behavioral barriers to care, and helps individuals with co-occurring disorders access needed behavioral health services and connections to primary care for their medical needs.a The most frequent service connections upon discharge are in mental health, substance abuse, and medical clinics. Staff will coordinate with King County; other EDs; and behavioral health, social service, and housing providers, in orderto ensure appropriate referrals and linkages to services. The team uses HMC primary care and aftercare clinics to provide urgent and long-term service connections to primary care. HMC's mental health services provide mental health urgent care, while long-term case management comes from a variety of community mental health providers.s 0 B.

How does the program advance the recommended MIDD policy goals? This initiative impacts the recommended MID policy goal of \"divert individuals with behavioral health needs from costly interventions, such as jail, emergency rooms, and hospitals.\" The Crisis Solutions Center (CSC), operated by the Downtown Emergency Service Center (DESC), provides King County first responders with alternative options to jail and hospital settings when engaging with individuals, age 1B and older, in behavioral health crisis. The intent of the facility is to stabilize and support individuals in the least restrictive setting possible, while identifying and directly linking them to appropriate and ongoing services in the community. The CSC has three program components intended to stabilize and support an individual in the least restrictive setting possible, while identifying and directly linking that individualto ongoing services in the community. 1. Program Description 0 A. Service Components/Design (Brief) The Adult Crisis Diversion Center strategy (herein referred to as the Crisis Solutions Center or CSC) provides King County first responders with a therapeutic, community- based alternative to jails and hospitals when engaging with adults who are in behavioral health crisis. King County contracts with DESC to provide crisis diversion services in King County at the CSC. DESC has a strong history of engaging with individuals who are homeless, who experience mental health and substance use disorders, and who may be reticent in accepting traditional services. The CSC has three program components; Mobile Crisis Team (MCT), Crisis Diversion Facility (CDF), and Crisis Diversion lnterim Services (CDIS). The programs are intended to stabilize and support individuals in the least restrictive setting possible, while identifying and directly linking them to appropriate and ongoing services in the community. The MCT consists of a team of two mental health clinicians, trained in the field of substance use disorders, who provide crisis outreach and stabilization services in the community 24 hours a day,7 days per week (2417). The team responds to requests from first responders in the field to assist with people in a mental health and/or substance use crisis. They intervene with individuals in their own communities, identify immediate needs and resources and, in most cases, relieve the need for any further intervention by first responders. The MCT is available for consultation or direct outreach to any location in King County and may assist individuals in crisis by providing or arranging for transportation.

How does the program advance the recommended MIDD policy goals? This program primarily addresses the recommended MIDD policy goal of \"divert individuals with behavioral health needs from costly interventions, such as jail, emergency rooms, and hospitals.\" The Next Day Appointment (NDA) program helps to divert people experiencing a behavioral health crisis from psychiatric hospitalization - especially those who are not currently enrolled in the King County mental health outpatient treatment system. Over 91 percent of individuals who participate in NDAs would otherwise be considered for psychiatric inpatient care. The NDA program is designed to provide an urgent crisis response follow-up (within 24 hours) for individuals who are presenting in emergency rooms at local hospitals with a behavioral health crisis, or as a follow-up to the Designated Mental Health Professionals (DMHPS)who have provided an evaluation for involuntary treatment and found the person not eligible for, or could be diverted from detention with follow-up services. MIDD funding enables the NDA program to provide follow-up services for a brief period after an initial appointment, in order to increase the degree to which participants link to ongoing care. 1. Program Description 0 A. Seruice Components/Design (Brief) lndividuals served in NDA services present with a behavioral health crisis, either to hospital emergency deparlments or to crisis outreach mental health professionals. These are adults that typically do not have access to any ongoing mental health services. The crisis clinicians that respond to the individual in the hospital or community setting assess the individual and determine that an inpatient psychiatric hospital stay could be averted if the person had access to outpatient crisis stabilization services with the 24 hours following their crisis assessment. A referral is made to the King County Crisis Clinic and an appointment is made with the NDA service in the geographic area of the person's preference. lncluding baseline services made possible by the state and other funding partners, NDA Services include:. Crisis intervention and stabilization services provided by professional staff trained in crisis management.. Consultation with an appropriate clinical specialist when such services are necessary to ensure culturally appropriate crisis response.. Referral to long-term mental health or other care as appropriate.

Goals The Next Day Appointment (NDA) program is a clinic-based, follow-up crisis responseprogram that provides assessment, brief intervention and linkage to ongoing treatment.The goal of the program is to provide crisis stabilization and to \u00e3\u00a1vert in\u00e3ivid-uals frompsychiatric inpatient care. 0 C. Expected Numbers of lndividuals Served At the recommended level of funding, the NDA program is expected to serve about 1,800 people per year at its five current sites, including state- and MIDD-funded capacity. Of these, most come from hospital emergency departments, while otherreferrals come from DMHPs, the Crisis Clinic's voluntaiy hospital authorization team,and other first responder services. MIDD-supported follow-up services will be provided toat least 350 NDA participants per year system wide, based on their needs.l Depending on future funding levels from the state and from MIDD, some MIDD fundingunder this initiative could potentially be used to expand initial NDA appointment capacityto help meet demand. 1 lmproved methods for counting recipients of the enhanced service will be explored, as even more people may bereceiving follow-up services via MIDD than have been counted in recent years.

How does the program advance the recommended MIDD policy goals? This program primarily addresses the recommended MIDD policy goal of \"reduce the number, length, and frequency of behavioral health crisis events.\" The Children's Crisis Outreach Response System (CCORS) supports a countywide crisis response system for King County youth up to age 18 who are currently experiencing a mental health crisis. These services are provided to children, youth, and families where the functioning of the child and/or the family is severely impacted due to family conflict and/or severe emotional or behavioral problems, and where the current living situation is at imminent risk of disruption. CCORS also addresses the needs of children and youth who are being discharged from a psychiatric hospital or juvenile detention center and need intensive short-term services while ongoing supports are being put in place. An enhancement is included to reduce response time when law enforcement is involved, in order to improve de-escalation, follow-through with service linkage, and outcomes for families. 1. Program Description 0 A. Service Components/Design (Brief) The CCORS program utilizes strength-based, individualized approaches via teams that include Crisis lntervention Specialists (Menial Health Professionals and Children's Mental Health Specialists), Family Advocates, and Parent Partners. Teams meet the referred youth and families in the home and other community locations. CCORS partners with families, as well as other professionals and systems, and uses short{erm, evidence-based, crisis intervention strategies. Services are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days ayear. The CCORS program has three main components: Crisis Outreach Services and Non- Emergent Outreach; lntensive Stabilization Services (lSS); and, Crisis Stabilization Beds (CSBs) also known as Hospital Diversion Beds. Crisis Outreach Services and Non-EmerqentQutrca\u00e7h CCORS' Crisis Emergent and Non-Emergent Outreach services are available to children and youth in King County who meet certain crisis service criteria and are not currently receiving services through a contracted mental health agency. Emergent Crisis Response consists of: 1) crisis telephone response available 24 hours a day, seven days a week that includes immediate access to a mental health professional, as well as: 2) an outreach team that, at a minimum, consists of a Children's Mental Health Specialist and a Family Advocate who are trained in crisis management. Page 1 of 4 113 of2901 8406 0Appendix H MIDD 2 Preliminary rmprementation lnformation Children's Crisis Outreach Response System (CD-11) Crisis Outreach services provide rapid face-to-face response at the community site ofthe escalating behavior. Teams develop crisis safety plans with family and yo\u00fath input.Teams also provide crisis outreach to children/youth not engaged witir a contracted mental health agency that have been referred for inpatient hospitalization. Teamsprovide referrals for voluntary hospitalization or coordination with the Designated MentalHealth Professionals (DMHPs) for involuntary hospitalization when neede\u00f0, while keeping youth in the least restrictive option available that is clinically appropriate. lntensive Stabilization Services fl SSl ISS is an intensive service lasting up to g0 days that provides children and youth whoseplacement is at risk with immediate crisis stabilization. They build on the family,s andchild/youth's strengths and provide creative and flexible soiutions focused on ieachingand modeling parenting and problem-solving skills, developing skills necessary tomanage behavior within the home/community environment and to prevent out-bf-homeplacement. A variation of this stabilization service is available to those not enrolled in thepubic mental health system services provided by King County who are determined toneed and agree to stabilization services upon init\u00edal ciisis outreach services. They areavailable for up to eight weeks. This care is coordinated with new or existing communityproviders, including, but not limited to, other treatment providers, Departme\u00f1t of Childand Family Services (DCFS) socialworkers and school staff. Crisis Stabilization Beds (CSBs) Crisis Stabilization Beds (CSBs) are designed for CCORS clients who would likely behospitalized or experience another out of home placement without the use of a C5B, orare enrolled in RSN contracted mental health services and are in need of a CSB forhospital diversion. crisis outreach teams facilitate access to these beds. Potential Future Service lmprovements As part of broader efforts to improve crisis response countywide, CCORS and KingCounty will explore potential ways to deliver crisis servicesfor transition-ag\" yorn! adults up to age 21, andlor to serve previously homeless youth in behavioial'frealti crisis. B. Goats CCORS's main goals are:. to provide a single, integrated, county-wide, comprehensive system of crisis outreach response, stabilization intervention, family reunification, and transition to community supports for children and youth; and ' to ensure the safety of children/youth and their families and/or caregivers who are facing crisis situations while helping them stay the least restrictive location via community-based services and supports.

How does the program advance the recommended M\\DD poticy goals? This program primarily addresses the recommended MIDD policy goal of \"improve health andwellness of individuals living with behavioral health conditions.\" Families with children or youth who have serious emotional and behavioral disturbances facenumerous challenges that traditional services models are unable to address. These children oryouth often experience profound difficulties with functioning in school, maintaining relationshipswith family and peers, coping with their emotions, and controlling their behavior. \"Sometimes these difficulties strain families to the point that they see no other solution than to place theirchild outside of their home. When families turn to formal systems for support, they may experience a fragmented process that is driven more by system needs itian Uy th'e needs of thechild, youth and family. This fragmented process furthei isolates these youth \u00e1nd families asthey develop a mistrust of professionals and lose hope in their own recovery. Families who participate in wraparound often describe it as the only approach that truly workedfor them- They report feeling heard, and then begin to develop positive'working relatio\u00f1shipswith professionals andsystems, while also increasing their own resilience, seli-determination, and overall well-being.l Throughout the phases of wraparound, youth and their families learnthe skills needed to continue this process, informally cieating a \u00e9ustainable plan of care. Thisreduces reliance on formal systems, helps families to stay together and avoid the inappropriate use of more costly resources such as inpatient care, foster c\u00e3re, and/or the juvenile justice system. 1. Program Description 0 A. Servrce Components/Design (Brief) Wraparound is a team based approach to serving youth with complex needs - typically those involved with two or more child-serving systems - and their families. Wraparound's intensive, strength based and individualized care planning and management supports youth in their community and within their family culture., Wraparound is a proven, effective approach to developing and coordinating plans of care that build on the strengths of the child or youth and family. Resulting flans areindividualized and based on the needs and goals identified Oy ttre famillplans addressthe specific cultural needs of the family, with a goal that services and s\u00fapports occur in the family's home and community whenever possible. A team of supportive individuals'wraps' around the family to help them achieve their goals. The team'is made up ofprofessionals as well as 'natural' supports like relatives, neighbors, coaches, 8406 Appendix H MIDD 2 Service lmprovement Plan Initiative - Preliminary lmplementation lnformation Wraparound Services for Youth (CD-15) who will continue to be involved with the family for years. High-fidelity wraparound follows the guidelines as set forth in the Natio\u00f1al Wraparound lnitiative.3 Fidelity monitoring includes tracking outcomes and continuous observation and verification of the skills and practices of facilitators. Fidelity monitoring also supports continuous quality improvement. The implementation of Wraparound in MIDD 2 willfeature a blended funding and services model that fulfills the terms of a 2013 legal settlement with Washington State (LR. vs. Quigtey and Teeter). That settlement requires the provision of Wraparound with lntensive Services (known as WlSe) by all regions in the state io Medicaid-eligible children and youth with complex behavioral health needs.a ln King County, many of these individuals are currently served by MIDD Wraparound. The WlSe program, aS defined in the settlement agreement, consists of Wraparound, intensive community- based mental health services, and mobile crisis outreach and stabilization services. These services have been available in King County for several years, due in part to MIDD 1 investments in Wraparound and the Children's Crisis Outreach Response System (CCORS). While some new Medicaid funds will be provided by the state to deliver WlSe, the state's funds do not cover the costs of providing the delivery team and services required of the WlSe program, nor do those funds support non-Medicaid activities and services that MIDD currently funds through MIDD 1 funding. MIDD funding also enables Wraparound to be provided to children and families not eligible for Medicaid, or not eligible for WlSe services. (Under MIDD 1, Wraparound was provided to all families and children who met multiple systems involvement criteria, without regard to family means and without billing participants' private insurance.) 0 B. Goals Via a collaborative, facilitated process with an emphasis on family voice and choice, Wraparound brings multiple systems and naturalsupports togetherwith a youth and family. The process and the system participants work together to create effective crisis and safety planning, support children and theirfamilies by addressing behaviors or unmet needs to prevent out of home placement, and help youth get back on track developmentally. As implemented in King County, Wraparound has a specific role in assisting families in avoiding long-term inpatient admission or helping a child rejoin family after a long-term inpatient stay or an institutional placement. Similarly, the state-funded WlSe initiative described in 1.4 above, which will be paired with MIDD 2 Wraparound and also used to support outpatient and crisis programs, is designed to provide comprehensive behavioral health services and supports to Medicaid-eligible individuals, up to 21 years of age, with complex behavioral needs and to their families. The goal of the program is for eligible youth to live and thrive in their t Walker, J.S. and Bruns, E.

How does the program advance the recommended MIDD policy goals? This initiative impacts the recommended MIDD policy goal of \"divert individuals with behavioral health needs from costly interventions, such as jail, emergency rooms, and hospitals.\" lndividuals who have abused alcohol and/or other drugs have an increased risk of being involved in vehicle and other crashes, as well as a heightened risk for other health problems, which may lead to emergency room admissions. SBIRT is a toolto universally screen and identify people with mild to severe substance use disorders (SUD) and/or who have depression or anxiety. Persons identified by SBIRT screening are given a brief intervention (Bl) by a medical professional or counselor. The brief intervention (Bl) addresses the individual's substance use, depression and/or anxiety and assists with establishing a plan to reduce use in the future. When indicated, patients are referred to specialty care for their substance use disorder, depression or anxiety. ln addition to identifying and intervening with people who have mild SUDs, SBIRT also identifies individuals with moderate to severe SUD and works to connect them (Referral to Treatment) to substance use treatment or options. ln cases where there is not a SUD but there is an indication of depression or anxiety, patients are referred to a behavioral health specialist. ln cases where SUD and depression and/or anxiety are present, depression/anxiety are handled first because often times the SUD is the self-medication for the depression/anxiety symptoms. SBIRT services connect behavioral and primary health care to effectively meet the needs of individuals. 1. Program Description 0 A. Seruice Components/Design (Brief) MIDD SBIRT services have focused on emergency departments (ED) by providing staff support to assist with SBIRT for SUD. Harborview ED, St Francis ED and Highline ED have staff that assist in SBIRT. Universal screening has not been possible with limited staff resources for an ED with 24 hour seven days per week operation. SBIRT is provided to individuals when a patient shows an indication of use of alcohol or drugs; the SBIRT clinician is alerted and will complete a brief screen for alcohol and or drugs. The tools chosen are the Alcohol Use Disorders ldentification Test (AUDIT)1 and Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST)2.

Older adults who screen positive are enrolled in the Mental Health lntegration Program (MHIP)1, a short-term behavioral health intervention based on the Collaborative Care Model. The Collaborative Care Model is a specific model for integrated care developed at the University of Washington Advancing lntegrated Mental Health Solutions (AIMS) Center to treat common mental health conditions that are persistent in nature and require systematic follow-up. Services take place in primary care clinics that are contracted under Public Health. MHIP focuses on a defined patient population identified through screening and uses measurement-based practice and treatment to reduce depression and anxiety (as measured by validated screening tools such as the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7). Primary care providers work with behavioral health professionals to provide evidence-based medications and psychosocialtreatments supported by regular consultation with a psychiatric specialist and treatment adjustment for patients who are not improving. Treatment lasts on average for six months. Adults with more severe or complex needs that cannot be adequately treated in primary care are referred to mental health and substance use disorder treatment. 1. Program Description 0 A.

How does the program advance the recommended MIDD policy goals? This program primar.ily addresses the recommended MIDD policy goal of \"improve health and wellness of individuals living with behavioral health conditions.\" The sexual assault service delivery system addresses a unique set of needs as compared to broader community mental health treatment. ln the sexual assault service system, victims and/or their families are seeking services as a result of the crime and its impact. They may have a variety of specific needs including medical, forensic, crisis response, information, advocacy to assist with legal needs and counseling. Often victims and families may not know the variety of issues and th\u00ea impacts of the assault.l Community sexual assault programs (CSAPs) are designed to provide holistic services tailored to the sexual assault-specific needs of victims. Because of their experience with and in-depth of knowledge of all aspects of sexual assault, the organizations are equipped to anticipate and respond based on an individualized assessment of needs. CSAPs provide empirically supported services through a trauma-informed lens. This holistic response means that the organization can address the full range of concerns about legal, medical and other systems that may adversely affect mental health outcomes, while also providing brief early interventions to reduce the likelihood of longer term mental health distress. For individuals who develop persisting sexual assault-specific mental health problems, effective evidence-based interventions are provided. 1. Program Description O A. Service Components/Design (Brief) Services currently provided by the CSAPs as part of this initiative include the following aScreening and assessment to identify the mental health and/or substance use disorder (SUD) needs of survivors receiving sexual assault services at the Contractor; Evidence-based trauma-focused therapy for those children, teen, and adult survivors of sexual assault who would benefit from the therapy;2 and 1 This contrasts with typical assistance from traditional public mental health settings where clients are eligible for services if they meet access to care criteria related to a mental health disorder, and their unique needs related to the assault may or may not be able to addressed directly in that setting. ' Eviden\"e-based \u00e5ervices at King County's CSAPs include prolonged exposure (PE), prolonged-exposure-adolescent (PE-A), cognitive processing therapy (CPT), parent child interaction therapy (PCIT), and the common elements treatment approach (CETA), and other evidence-based approaches proven effective for post-traumatic stress disorder including interventions specifically for children.

This initiative is expeced to impact the recommended MIDD policy goal of \"Divert individuals with behavioral health needs from costly interventions, such as jail, emergency rooms, and hospitals.\" The Moral Reconation Therapy (MRT) model in this initative uses a positive group dynamic to alter inappropriate thought and behavior amongst domestic violence (DV) offenders. The Moral Reconation Therapy-Domestic Violence (MRT-DV) pilot program adaptation is a cognitive- behavioral program designed to change how DV offenders think (beliefs) and change behavior to one of equality and acceptance. The MRT-DV adaptation takes approximately 55 sessions to complete, which are conducted twice weekly at CCAP. Both the MRT-DV and standard DV education occur within a 60-day court order to CCAP. 1. Program Description 0 A. Seruice Components/Design (Brief) This initiative enhances program services offered at CCAP in the areas of behavioral health education and intervention, and addresses criminogenic risk factors specifically associated with DV. Since 2014, MIDD has supported a clinician from Sound Mental Health (SMH) trained in MRT and the specialized DV version to prepare and facilitate groupsforone caseload of 15 men participantswho are randomly assigned to the MRT- DV program at CCAP for approximately 60 days. All MRT-DV participants have a substance use disorder, primarily involving alcohol and/or cannabis. Pafticipants are clinically assessed and enrolled in appropriate substance use disorder (SUD) treatment at CCAP per American Society of Addiction Medicine criteria. 0 B. Goals The program goal is to realize an increase in the scope and effectiveness of the services offered at CCAP and appropriately address the changing service needs of court-ordered participants. Specifically, the MRT-DV pilot was implemented to intervene and provide a holistic array of services including outpatient SUD treatment with court monitoring to promote participant behavior change and recovery, and reduce recidivism and victimization.

Service Components/Design (Brief) Supportive housing with services targeted to people with behavioral health conditionswill feature, as much as feasible, a Housing First'approach. Housing First is a homelessbest practice, designed to create a stable environment where hous\u00f0holds can addresstheir health issues while receiving additional employment and stable housing services. Capitalfunding to create housing is paired with service funding to ensure success ofthose being housed. While the level of service may vary, for riost households facingbehavioral health conditions, some level of service\u00f5 will-be required for success. Permanent supportive housing is the most service-enriched housing environment. Manyindividuals and households with persistent mental illness and/or chronic addiction needthis high intensity level of services. Although costly, permanent supportive housing isstill more cost effective when compared to homelessness ano frequ\u00e5nt hospitalizationand/or incarceration. A portion of funds underthis in\u00edtiativewill also be used to continue rentalsubsidies inexisting supportive housing projects.

How does the program advance the recommended MIDD policy goals? This initiative impacts the recommended MIDD policy goal of \"Divert individuals with behavioral health needs from costly interventions, such as jail, emergency rooms, and hospitals.\" Research has shown that people who experience homelessness with health conditions struggle to establish and/or maintain appropriate treatment within the mainstream health care systeml. Many people experiencing problems are caught up in cycles of crisis and lack the family and other social supports as well as the income and other material resources that might help them break these cycles. The individuals are extremely challenging for behavioral health and medical providers to locate and engage, let alone establish in an ongoing plan of treatment. Their chronic behavioral health and medical conditions worsen, their likelihood of involvement with the criminaljustice system escalates, and, in many cases, they begin to cycle in and out of emergency rooms, inpatient hospital stays, and jail. These dynamics help explain the significantly higher risk of hospital readmission for patients experiencing homelessness that has been established in numerous research studies.2 This increased risk relates to ihe scarcity of places in which homeless patients can safely rest and obtain thg support they need to fully recuperate. lt also relates to behavioral health disorders that can lead to behaviors that complicate or undermine recuperation.t Because of this risk, hospitals often delay discharge of homeless patients past the point at which they would discharge a person with housing and other necessary supports for recuperation and thus past the point that is medically indicated.a Their experience has shown that when a person's living situation makes it impossible to adequately rest, keep from walking or putting weight on a joint, or keep a surgical site clean, the hospital is much more likely to see the person return for infections or other problems that necessitate readmission. 1 Bonin E, Brehove T, Carlson C, Downing M, Hoeft J, Kalinowski A, Solomon-Bame J, Post P.

This program primarily addresses the recommended MIDD policy goal of \"improve health and wellness of individuals living with behavioral health conditions.\" The reduction of treatment caseloads by increasing the number of qualified staff provides for better treatment services, promoting the achievement of recovery outcomes for clientele, including proactive care that improves overall health and wellness. Additionally, workload reduction results in higher job satisfaction for treatment staff, thereby reducing staff turnover, which is a critical system improvement in the mental health treatment system. Studies have suggested that higher caseloads may result in reactive case management, with deficiencies in service planning, support for families and caregivers and liaison with other services.l When faced with high caseloads, case managers are more likely to deal with crises and immediate problems2 with a resulting negative impact on activities such as timely response to client needs, documentation of work, receptiveness to urgent client needs, contact during hospital admissions, home visits and advocacy.3 ln addition to the impacts cited above, there is evidence that higher caseloads are also associated with increased work-related stress, especially stress associated with workload and professional self-doubt. Higher caseload was also associated with lower case manager personal efficacy. lncreased job stress can exacerbate issues of staff burnout and pose problems with the recruitment and retention of case managers,o in addition to impacting health and safety outcomes and the quality of care provided to clients.s These findings support the need for active management of caseloads to minimize risk of overload. Although not tfie subject of a formal research study in King County, the issues outlined above have been reflected qualitatively by outpatient mental health provider agencies, as well as individual clinicians throughout King County. 1 lntagliata J. lmproving the quality of comm un ity care for the ch ronically clinically mentally disabled: the role of case management.

Seruice Components/Design (Brief) Workload reduction funding distributed among outpatient mental health provider agencies during MIDD 1 is recommended to continue in MIDD 2. ln addition, substanceuse disorder provid_ers are now participating in managed care under the integrated Behavioral Health Organization (BHO) structure, the \u00e3istribution of MIDD 2 f\u00fands (in addition to the accompanying Medicaid match) will be revisited with the input ofproviders, guided by the following principles, at a minimum: ' Medicaid-funded outpatient programs will be targeted, to ensure continued Medicaid match. ' Provider agencies will receive appropriations of funds in an equitable manner.' All mental health and substance abuse outpatient providers will have access to aportion of the funds.6 ' Small provider agencies will receive no less than a minimum amount that is sufficient to affect the size of their workforce in a measurable way. ' Accountability measures for providers will be consistent across agencies and will be tied clearly to policy goal outcomes. See section D below for riore details. 0 B. Goals 0Broad goals of this initiative include creating greater provider agency capacity to allowcase managers to se-e clients more regularly to assist them to achieve greater stabilityand recovery, as well as be more responsive to clients who are in crisisl This wouldinclude increased proactive case management, care coordination, family support, outreach, and advocacy, in alignment with the literature on workload im\u00feacts'described above. A related goal of this initiative is to decrease case manager turnover resultingfrom high caseloads, thus creating a more stable and effective workforce. C. Expected Numbers of lndividuals Served Under MIDD 1, only the number of participating provider agencies was measured. Thenumber of providers expected to participate will increase fr\u00f3m 17 to approximately 44.Because this initiative has the potential to have broad impact on all outpatient clients ofan agency that receives funding, it is not yet known how many individuals would benefit. D. Draft Outcomes and Performance Measures - outcomes and measures are expectedto be revised and included in the MIDD 2 Evaluation plan.0 initiative contributes to population outcomes of the MIDD 2 Framework, including emotional health daily functioning reduced substance use reduced jail, hospital and emergency department use u The distribution of funds in MIDD 2 between mental health services and substance use disorders services may beinfluenced in part byWashington Administrative Code requirements that keep typical substance use disorderscaseloads lower than mental health caseloads. Despite this consideration, ai le\u00e2st some funds will be available to allcontracted outpatient providers regardless of service type.

How does the program advance the recommended MIDD policy goals? This initiative addresses the recommended MIDD policy goal of \"increase culturally appropriate, trauma informed behavioral health services.\" The behavioral health workforce is in crisis. The behavioral health system is struggling to find and/or retain trained, licensed, and qualified staff to provide services those in need of services. Providers statewide report difficulty hiring and retaining the additional staff they need to fill demand. Behavioral health integration highlights the need for continuing education. Clients benefit when clinical staff are trained on the full spectrum of behavioral health conditions and how to best intervene. Coordinating services with primary care also requires training and education; this again will facilitate clients receiving optimal services. lntegrated care benefits from staff stability, confidence, and knowledge. The current workforce shoftage, evolving clinical knowledge, as well as the need to provide culturally appropriate services by staff that are reflective of populations being served will be factors in determining the best training programs to be utilized and disseminated. 1. Program Description 0 A. Service Components/Design (Brief) The original MIDD 1 strategy responded to the workforce shortage of Chemical Dependency Professionals (CDP) and provided reimbursement for Chemical Dependency Professional Trainees (CDPTS) for: tuition, books for CDP-related classes and testing fees. Due to CDP credential requirements mandating CDP clinical supervision, the agencies were also reimbursed for CDPT specific clinical supervision. CDPs received reimbursement for annual license fees and obtained reimbursed Continuing Education Units (CEU) to maintain their credentials. ln addition, this strategy funded Evidence-Based Practices (EBP) training, quality assurance (QA) for EBPs, Certified Prevention Professional (CPP) credentials, and a CDP certificate program through the University Of Washington School Of Social Work. Given the integration of mental health and substance use disorder, the present work shortages, and growing demand, this MIDD 2 initiative will create a develop a sustained, systems based approach to supporting and developing the behavioral health workforce. ln collaboration with the MIDD Oversight Committee and stakeholders, a Behavioral Health W\u00f3rkforce Development Plan (WDP) will be developed that may include:. lnvestment into initial credentials for behavioral health professionals, including psychiatric nurse practitioners and psychiatrists;. CEUs for credentialed staff and ongoing training of EBP and Practice Based Evidence (PBE) for mental health and substance use disorder (SUD) treatment including Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT); Page 1 of 3 175 o'f 2901 8406Appendix H MIDD 2 Service lmprovement lmplementation lncrease the and initiation of opioid prescribing Training program (oPTP) for professionals with prescriptive authority to assist in treatment opioid addiction; and lnitiation of a train{he-trainer program to build a work force that can train other clinical staff on adopted EDPs and pBEs. 0 B.

How does the program advance the recommended MIDD policy goals? This initiative impacts the recommended MIDD policy goal of \"divert individuals with behavioral health needs from costly interventions, such as jail, emergency rooms, and hospitals.\" The JDC program is effective at reducing recidivism and keeping youth engaged in the treatment process. (Bolan, 2007) King County JDC outcome studies have documented significant reductions in recidivism among program participants. Juvenile justice has increasingly become the service delivery point for adolescents with substance use disorder (SUD) and co-occurring problems that lack resources for other assistance. The JDC model provides improved, expanded, yet cost-effective adolescent SUD treatment in a coordinated system of care. The model of care in King Count! challenges systemic inequities and facilitates dialogue among justice and treatment professionals, families, and the youth themselves. JDC includes services designed for youth with SUD diagnoses and co-occurring Mental Health issues. All service areas of the JDC program have shown overtime to increase protective factors for youth involved in the program and strengthen the participant's transition to participating in pro-social behaviors and activities. 1. Program Description 0 A. Service Components/Design (Brief) JDC is a therapeutic court that provides services to juvenile charged with criminal offenses and identified as having a SUD diagnosis. JDC was implemented in July, 1999. This court is an alternative to regular juvenile court and is designed to improve the safety and well-being of youth and families involved in the juvenile justice system by providing the juvenile offender access to SUD treatment, judicial monitoring of their sobriety and individualized services to support the entire family tINCJFCJ, 2013). Juvenile justice-involved youth voluntarily enter the program and agree to increased court participation, SUD treatment, co-occurring mental health treatment if necessary and intensive case management in order to have their charges dismissed. Case review hearings initially occur every week and then become less frequent as the youth progresses through the program. lncentives are awarded to recognize the youths' achievements and graduated sanctions are used when a youth violate program rules. Youth typically spend between 12 and 18 months in the program. Through a collaborative, non-adversarial approach, the JDC integrates SUD, co- occurring mental health treatment and increased accountability into the process. Each youth has a JDC team and a comprehensive service team that reviews his or her t Seen, Heard and Engaged: A process Evaluation for Children in Court Programs (NCJFCJ, p.2013) Page 1 of 3 1 83 of 2901 8406 0 E.

Once in jail, theseindividuals stay much longer than those with similar crrarges *ho ,r\" not experiencing mentathealth disorders. Moreover, these individuals are release\u00e3 to the communitf with limitedbehavioral health and social service s\u00dapports criticalto stability in the community. Mental health court is often an effective strategy for diverting individuals with mental healthdisorders from further incarceration and engag-ihg these indi-viduals in communiiy-taseOtreatment and supportive services, with regul\u00e3r c\u00f3urt monitoring, to address the underlyingfactors contributing to their criminal j ustice-involvement. I 1. Program Description 0 A. Seruice Components/Design (Brief) Unt\u00edl 2010, RMHC served individuals who had cases originally filed in District Court orKing County Superior Court. ln 2010 MIDD funding was used-to increase tne servicesavailable for existing mental health courts and exp\u00e3nded KCDC Mental Health Court tobecome regional, such that any city in King County could refer court-involved individualsexperiencing significant mental illness to the RMH-C. Currently, there are three referral streams through which court-involved individuals canaccess RMHC. First, court-involved individuals \u00f0an have cases filed direcly into DistrictCourt. For tracking purposes, these cases are referred to as \"misdemeanoi cases.,,Second, court-involved individuals can be referred to RMHC from any city jurisdiction within King County (referred to as \"city cases\"). Third, participants cri..' U\u00e9 ieferred toRMHC from Superior Court when they have committed a felony and plead guilty to alesser gross misdemeanor or combination of other misdemeanors (referred'to \u00e3r';rJonydrop-downs\"). t Edgely, Michelle. \"why do mental health courts work?

A Racial Equity Impact Assessment (REIA) is a systematic examination of how different racial and ethnic groups will likely be affected by a proposed action or decision. REIAs are used to minimize unanticipated adverse consequences in a variety of contexts, including the analysis of proposed policies, institutional practices, programs, plans and budgetary decisions. The REIA can be a vital tool for preventing institutional racism and for identifying new options to remedy Iong-standing inequities. Why are they needed? REIAs are used to reduce, eliminate and prevent racial discrimination and inequities. The persistence of deep racial disparities and divisions across society is evidence of institutional racism- -the routine, often invisibie and unintentional, production of inequitabie social opportunities and outcomes. When racial equity is not consciously addressed, racial inequality is often unconsciously rep\u00ccicated. When should it be conducted? REIAs are best conducted during the decision-making process, prior to enacting new proposals. They are used to inform decisions, much like environmental impact statements, fiscal impact reports and workplace risk assessments. Where are they in use? The use of REIAs in the U.S. is relatively new and still somewhat limited, but new interest and initiatives are on the rise. The United I(ingdom has been using them with success for nearly a decade.Appendix K MIDD 2 Service lmprovement Plan EXAMPLES OF RACIALJUSTICE EQUITY lMPACTS Equity and Social Justice lnitiative King County, WA The county governrnent is usiag an Equity Impact Review Tool to intentionally consider the promotion of equity in the development and irnplernentation of \u00ec<ey policies, progra'rns and funding decisions.

IDENTIFYING STAKEHOLDERS Which racial/ethnic groups may be most affected by and concerned with the issues related to this proposal? 2. ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS Have stakeholders from different racial/ethnic groups- especially those most adversely affected-been informed, meaningfully involved and authentically represented in the development of this proposal? Who,s missing and how can they be engaged? 3. I IDENTIFYING AND DOCUMENTING RACIAL INEQUITIES Which racial/ethnic groups are currently most advantaged and most disadvantaged by the issues this proposal seeks to address? How are they affected differently? What quantitative and qualitative evidence of inequality exists? What evidence is missing or needed? 4. EXAMINING THE CAUSES What factors may be producing and perpetuating racial inequities \u00e2ssociated with this issue? How did the inequities arise? Are they expanding or narrowing? Does the proposal address root causes? If not, how could it?\u00f3. CONSIDERING ADVERSE IMPACTS What adverse impacts or unintended consequences could result from this policy? Which racial/ethnic groups could be negatively affected? How could adverse impacts be prevented or minimized? 7. ADVANCING EQUITABLE IMPACTS What positive impacts on equality and inclusion, if any, could result from this proposal? Which racial/ethnic groups could benefit? Are there further ways to maximize equitable opportunities and impacts? 8. EXAMINING ALTERNATIVES OR IMPROVEMENTS Are there better ways to reduce racial disparities and advance raciai equity? What provisions could be changed or added to ensure positive impacts on racial equity and inclusion? 9. ENSURING VIABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY Is the proposal realistic, adequately funded, with mechanisms to ensure successful implementation and enforcement. Are there provisions to ensure ongoing data collection, public reporting, stakeholder participation and public accountability? 5. CLARIFVING THE PURPOSE What does the proposal seek ro accomplish?

I am writing to urge King County toallocate MIDD funding to combat the drastic increase in heroin addiction that we see here in King County District Court, The number of defendants that we see in District Court who are heroin addicts istruly staggering. Each and every week here in Redmond I see dozens of defendants who are heroinaddicts. one of the remarkable things about this is that not only do I see defendants charged with crimes that one might expect of a heroin addict, such as Driving Under the lnfluence (of h\u00e0roin) or Possession of Drug Paraphernalia, but I also see defendants charged with other crimes such as theft andassault, including domestic violence. so very often the genesis of the criminal activity is the addiction. Many of the people in the criminal justice system who are heroin addicts are indigent and without stablehousing' Without stable housing it is nearly impossible for these \u00edndividuals to par-ticipate in, and besuccessful in, substance use disorder treatment. I urge King County to use MIDD funding to preventfurther needless deaths due to heroin overdoses and to combat increasing risks to public safety. ldeally, a criminaljustice diversion program \u00a1n D\u00a1str\u00a1ct court would help defendants to address legal issues while engaging in treatment arranged through the program and while living in stable housing arranged through the diversion program. I realize that such a diversion program would be an expensive proposition, however. At a minimum, I urge King County to use MIDD funding to develop programs thatwill provide treatment and housing options for defendants in the District and Municipal courts.

Name: Steve Chon Organization: Asian Counseling and Referral Service Comment: I am a clinical supervisor at Asian Counseling and Referral Service, I also worked as a case manager before I became a supervisor. As I worked with client who suffer from chronic mental health issues directly and indirectly, I can't say more how MIDD helped clients who do not have means to get the service from public agencies such as ours. I personally witnesses clients with chronic mental health issues who find a job, get tx from a doctor and a counselor, and even get housing. I strongly believe in second chance and opportunities in life. lwish our clients continue to get their second chance and opportunity in their life. Name: Janet Garrow Organization: King County District Court Comment: I am serving in my 17th year as a judge in the King County District Court on the Eastside. While I have always seen defendants who have alcohol or drug addictions, the significant increase in the number of misdemeanant offenders with a severe substance use disorders is astonishing. Last week I was on after-hours search warrant duty for King County. Most of the search warrant calls were for drivers who were committing serious driving offenses on freeways and were under the influence of drugs, typically heroin. For example, a driver was going the wrong way on Highway 520, a driver was involved in an accident on l-90, and another driver was speeding on l-5 at 80 mph and weaving in and out of traffic. While lam a strong proponent of early intervention measuresto prevent and treat substance use disorders outside of the criminaljustice system, the fact of the matter is that we have many people in the criminal justice system who are in serious need of treatment and housing, I see many people on the Eastside, of all ages, who are homeless and drug-addicted. lt is truly a tragedy. I know from experience that unless the person has some kind of stable housing it is highly unlikely she/he will be able to effectively engage in substance use disorder treatment. I have defendants ask me NOT to release them from jail until they can be released into an inpatient treatment program. They know that even one day on the street will, in all likelihood, will lead to heroin use. Many of the adult offenders in the criminal justice system in the District and Municipal courts serve their jail sentences in municipaljails such as SCORE, Kirkland and lssaquah. These facilities are ill-equipped to handle offenders 213 ol 2901 8406Appendix O with substance use disorders, Finding treatment placements for these offenders is a daily challenge for our court system. While I am glad to hear there is a proposalto increase treatment options at the Maleng Regional Justice Center jail, that enhancement does virtually nothing for most of the offenders in our District and Municipal Courts. I strongly urge King County to use MIDD funding to develop programs that will provide treatment and housing options for adult offenders in the District and Municipal courts. Most, if not all these offenders, are indigent, Without enhanced services for this population, we will continue to see an increase in loss of life dueto substance abuse and serious risks to public safety, Thank you for your consideration of these comments. Name: James Hopkins Organization: Member of Recovery Cafe Comment: Mr. Hopkins shared his life story, how he began to drink at age 9 and to smoke weed and use drugs beginning at age 13. When he first came to Recovery Caf\u00e9, he was homeless, struggling with addiction, hearing voices and hallucinating. Now he has permanent housing, in September he will have been sober for four years, he is employed full-time and he is looking for additional part-time work. He is no longer at risk for Type ll diabetes because of changes in his lifestyle. All this is because of Recovery Caf\u00e9. Recovery Caf\u00e9 makes him feel like he belongs and can be his genuine, authentic self, and he commends King County for including Recovery Cafe in MIDD ll and supporting Recovery Caf\u00e9 becoming available to more people in King County. Name: George Dicks Organization: Harborview Comment: Geriatric specialist at Harborview, also representing the aging with pride component of the older adult people in the system. Early intervention and prevention programs are important, given the prevalence of depression in older adults, especially in communities of color. We have well-established evidence-based programs that through sheltering and socialization enhance wellness and fitness, reducing the severity and prevalence of depression in older adults. He urged the Oversight Committee to keep in mind the high cost of depression in respect to its effects on multiple aspects of health and he asked for continued funding that supports the mental health of older adults, He noted especially the expansion in South King County that will help communities of color especially. Mr. Dicks also voiced his support of GRAT. All older adult programs will affect all of us, even in this room. Name: Jim Marshall Organization: Retired from Harborview Medical Center Comment: Jim Marshall, a licensed independent clinical social worker and Chemical Dependency Professional (CDP), recently retired from Harborview Medical Center afler 27 years of witnessing the effects of mental illness and substance abuse on people. Mr. Marshallencouraged the Oversight Committee to support for LBGTQ people in particular because of the disproportionate rates of depression in that population: 40 percent say they have considered suicide, with higher rates among minority populations, due to stigma, victimization, and in many cases criminalization. Mr, Marshall 214 o'\u00cd 290'18406 Appendix O respectfully requested funding for comprehensive, evidence-based mental health and substance use disorder training programs. Name: Kathleen Sullivan Organization: Generationswith Pride Comment: Kathleen Sullivan, Director of a new organization called Generations with Pride that is workingto reduce isolation and increase accessibilityforthe aging Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Questioning (LGBTQ) population in King County. Ms. Sullivan voiced gratitude for the support that is being shown for this important population: as the UW SSW study has shown, there are clear disparities in care for this group within the older adult population in our County, and this group is expected to double. Research has shown that a lifetime of victimization and internalized stigma leads to greater mental health needs of LGBTQ. lsolation and feelings of loneliness increase likelihood of early death of all older adults, but especially LGBTQ older adults. Name: Judy Strong Organization: Evergreen Health Geriatric Regional Assessment Team Comment: Ms. Strong spoke from two pages or prepared comment. She noted that GRAT is one of only two MIDD ll recommendations directed to the geriatric population, and that the current recommendation drafted by the Oversight Committee is to cut GRAT's funding, GRAT receives referrals from first responders and other entities, responding to first-responder referrals within 24 hours and all others within three business days. They do assessments for cognitive functioning She shared stories of individuals and families helped by GRAT: one of an elderly woman showing up a school every day, school called police and police called GRAT; another of a 9O-year old man experiencing increased difficulty caring for his wife, who called police who in turn called GRAT, who worked with the entire family to set up appropriate care for the elder in need of care; and another story of a woman in her 60s with known mental illness, living in her car in a church, where the church called GRAT, and GRAT arranged the client to go to the hospital. GRAT is not a program-based service but a person-based service that connects people with services, arranges hospitalizations, provides education to families -going everywhere in King County. No one else is providingthis service, and it is crucial tothe crisis prevention network. Ms. Strong asked the Oversight Committee to restore to current levels GRAT funding in its recommendations. Name: Anne Lee Organization: TeamChild Comment: We are very pleased to see the MIDD ll recommendations that emphasize investments in mental health and behavioral supports for youth who are involved in the justice system. lnvestments that are targeted to diverting children out of the justice system and into supports that show better evidence for health and well being will have a positive impact on reducing the racial disparities in the justice system. New concepts like the Family lntervention Restorative Services and the dedicated funding for alternatives to detention are excellent approaches. As the strategies are developed, we hope that they include flexibility so that supports can be tailored forthe individualneeds of children who are in conflict with the law. There is opportunity to achieve a tailored approach that provides meaningful, 215 of 2901 8406Appendix O timely and lasting support to children and families, CORS, behavioral assessments, and wrap around services have potential for such alignment. We belleve that they can be better aligned to ensure that youth are getting services when they need them. We also hope to see clear directives around supports that actually meet the needs of underserved children, including children of color and children with disabilities' Racial disparities persist in all of our public systems - education, health care, child welfare, and juvenile justice. MIDD ll investments can make a difference, but there needs to be clear direction about improving outcomes for these groups. Finally, missing in the recommendations are a system of ensuring that people who are marginalized and not able to access the system are able to. Legal aid and other advocates are a critical service that could ensure that the systems we create to suppott people are actually serving those most in need. Advocacy can also play a role in ensuring that individuals are able to transition into state and federally funded programs for longer term support than those services provided by the county. A portion of MIDD ll should be dedicated to helping adults and children with access to the MIDD and other behavioral health services. Name: Kim Hendr:ickson Organization: City of Shoreline comment: Public comment Kim Hendrickson, city of shoreline May 6, 20L6 I am writing to urge the reconsideration of the City of Shoreline Police Department's request for a RADAR Outreach Coordinator. This request was not one of the programs recommended by the MIDD oversight Committee. I believe it should be. I was brought on this year, by the City of Shoreline, to help its police department respond to individuals with behavioralhealth issues. lt's been a troubling experience. Deputies encounter people, every shift, who have untreated or poorly managed mental illness. They are asked to respond to situations, every day, involving people who are visibly suffering and without the ability to help themselves. What they tell me, to an officer, is that there is very little they can do in these critical situations. ITA criteria is high. The mobile crisis team is useful but response time is long and their ability to respond is limited. The crisis diversion center is an option but the distance issignificant-and many people in need of help will not willingly be taken. There is no one with the time and training, within the department, to provide counseling, give professional advice, or conduct follow up visits-and/or connect people to needed treatment and services. A single Outreach Coordinator assisting deputies in Shoreline will not help all people in allsituations. But if this person is a social worker, or other type of MHP, it will give Shoreline police a person to call who can counsel individuals in need of care, and link them to resources and services. One of the central purposes of MIDD dollars is to divert people from jails and emergency services, and provide them access to care. I urge the MIDD Committee to understand the importance of the Outreach Coordinator in this context, and to reconsider our application. Thank you for your consideration. Kim Hendrickson Name: Anita Khandelwal Organization: DPD Comment: lfirst BHRD for its extraordinary work. The MIDD ll process has felt thorough and transparent and I truly believe that our community will be healthier as a result of the programming that is eventually implemented. ln going through the MIDD process, it seems like there are two implicit 216 o\u00cd 2901 8406 Appendix O but core principles underlying the recommendations and I thought it might make sense to articulate them and apply them explicitly going forward. 1) any organization or program funded by MIDD ll should first look to Medicaid to see if federal dollars can pay forthe programming. All programming that could be paid for by Medicaid should be. MIDD ll funds should only be used to pay for programming that Medicaid will not pay for; 2) all programs should provide trauma-informed care and should apply principles of harm reduction. This is important because consistency across the continuum of care will more likely result in successful outcomes for individuals. Mixed messages about expectations regarding, for example, abstinence may confuse and frustrate recipients of service; Regarding specific programming, I want to particularly applaud the creation of a Crisis Diversion Center in South King County and funding for respite beds and mobile behavioral health crisis teams. Given the explosion in the volume of lnvoluntary Treatment Act cases, it is critical that the County fund programs that could divert individuals away from that system. I also want to applaud LEAD expansion, which will help keep low-leveloffenders out of the system and accessing services that they need. Finally, I note that while the draft recommends funding FIRS, \u00a1t fails to provide enough money for the residential component of the program. The full benefits of the program cannot be realized without adequate funding for the residential component of the program. Thank you again for your workl Name: Paul Daniels Organization: King County Superior Court Comment: I am writing regarding the FIRS program and the recommendations to fund it, Family lntervention and Restorative Services represents a paradigm shift in the response to family violence that significantly reduces the number of youth being presented to King County's Juvenile Detention. FIRS is also a departure from formal court processing that allows for an immediate response to families in crisis. It will be necessary to re-address the funding proposals in order to maintain FIRS under MIDD ll. Without additional funding, the model will revert to once again booking youth into detention for family violence incidents. Name: Cecilia Camino Organization: SuperiorCourt Commentr lntervention and Restorative Services (FIRS) is to provide interventions and services to youth and families that are designed to: 1) decrease violence in the home, 2)decrease further police contact and detentions, and 3) minimize couft involvement. The FIRS process allows youth an oppoftunity to divert their legal matter out of the formal juvenile court and detention system while connecting the youth and family with needed services. As a Juvenile Probation Counselor who works directly with this population, I can personally attest to the positive impact this program has had with youth and families involved in family violence. We are able to intervene and provide alternatives to court process immediately, while putting in place direct services more quickly and effectively. The current proposal includes the addition of a non-secure respite center for youth who would normally be detained. Funding this important piece of the program will be key, as it willeliminate the need for 217 of2901 8406Appendix O detention in these cases, while allowing families needed respite time and an increased opportunity to engage youth and families in needed services. Name: Lauren Davis Organization: Washington Recovery Alliance Comment: This is a terrific and important set of recommendations. lt represents an inclusive process and a tremendous body of work by the BHRD division. Thank you I I think it would be incredibly strategic to invest a small amount of money (S50-75K) to hire a young professional to organize activities for a King County Recovery Coalition, as described in the briefing paper. As proposed, this coalition would operate under the oversight of the Washington Recovery Alliance (WRA), which is a statewide network of behavioral health recovery coalitions. The WRA has the ideas and expeftise, but not the time to carry out a planned stigma reduction campaign. Proposed activities include training a speakers bureau of people in recovery and affected families to speak at public meetings, to help ease concerns of neighbors when treated facilities are being sited. The WRA also seeks to host public recovery events and to create a social marketing campaign to reduce stigma. Stigma presents an obstacle to the fulfillment of nearly every strategy proposed in MIDD 2. For example, stigma creates road blocks to the creation and siting of new treatment facilities and it prevents individuals in distress from seeking care. lt also isolates families and friends who are supporting a loved one in crisis, We would be remiss not to dedicate a small portion of funds toward its eradication. Name: Jeremy Crowe Organization: King County Superior Court Comment: Family lntervention and Restorative Services (FIRS) represents a example of a needed and appropriate shifting of our focus to assessing needs/services up front and a path of prevention/decreasing recidivism vs. the previous long-standing approach: waiting for more criminal referrals to pile up and what can be a slow and lengthy court process to get to court supervision and services (while the youth/family and surrounding community, in the mean-time, can often continue to struggle immensely). FIRS attacks the number one driver of youth in detention - domestic violence/assault - one of the most intense, complex and difficult to intervene in issues in our community. lt needs more funding to allow its full vision to be realized, including \"Z-hall\" at juvenile detention, a non-secure respite/shelter \"unit\" foryouth involved in DV incidents at home. This will be a staffed/supervised place that promotes entry into an outside-of-court intervention process where they can access support and services in lieu of secure detention and in lieu of initiatingthe formalcourt and charging/filing process. FIRS puts a large dent in the number of kids sitting in detention for DV/assault- related referrals and connects youth and families with timely and often immediate support, assessments, safety planning and services. lt has shown positive results in it's first 4 months and we continue to assess how best to serve youth and families embroiled in intense conflict in their homes. This team approach combines immediate staffing, risk/violence assessments, negotiating, family/team meetings and truly tailored/matching service referrals, sometimes within hours of the DV incident occurring. Only funding a promising new program and approach like FIRS for a short period of time and/or only funding part of what it demands in order to truly flourish doesn't make much sense. We are moving towards a more informed, family-empowering and healthy approach to domestic violence in our community FIRS is and can continue to be a part of this shift towards something that makes more sense 218 of 2901 8406 Appendix O and is more effective for our families and communities. But it simply can't develop or even stick around if it is not fully/appropriately funded. Name: Susan Craighead Organization: King County Superior Court Comment: I wish to comment wearing two different \"hats.\" First, as a member of the Juvenile Justice Equity Steering Committee, I am pleased to see the focus on youth and alternatives to secure detention. However, the recommendations themselves are insufficiently detailed for members of the Steering Committee to be able to evaluate their merits versus the merits of other ideas. lt is difficult to discern how well the existing programs or the new programs will serve highly marginalized populations. I suspect the Committee will be pleased to see the recommendation for Community Driven Mental Health Grants, but would ask why this strategy is not embedded in all of the recommendations. Different parts of our community may need services from small, community based organizations that can be more culturally sensitive. lt is important not to relegate cultural sensitivity to a S300k program. The Steering Committee will need more information (perhaps a visit by Kelli Carroll at our next meeting) and time to present comments on behalf of the Steering Committee as a whole. Speaking as the Presiding Judge, I want to express my gratitude on behalf of the Court for the generosity that these recommendations demonstrate for the criminal and juvenile justice systems. My comments need to be taken in this light. First, it appears that FIRS was funded al50% of the actualcost; the 5700k allocated will pay for the professional staff and evidence-based services, but not a home for FIRS, Without an additional S700k (which could come partly from sources other than MIDD) the youth would have to go back to staying in detention for the \"cooling off\" period before they can return home. Second, with regard to the Mental Health Alternatives to Secure Detention: we are very supportive of this idea, but we would encourage you to add runaways to the list of youth who might be suitable for these beds. Most of those who arrested on warrants and placed in detention suffer from PTSD; without a safe temporary place to put them, DSHS places them in hotels or the next available foster placement, which may not be appropriate and will caus\u00e9 them to run again. The funding recommended for Family Treatment Couft does not allow it to be expanded to South King County. Superior Court obtained a grant to allow us to expand because our cases increasingly come from South King County. The grant requires matching funds from MIDD. Without those dollars, we will have to return grant money. For everyone's information, FamilyTreatment Court is not a diversionfrom the criminaljustice system. Rather, it enables families in the dependency system to reunite rather than have children grow in foster care. FTC offers the best chance for family reunification and beneficiaries are young children who get to be raised by their biological parents. Superior Court is happy to work with MIDD staff to see if there are other ways to raise money for some of these objectives, such as grant funding or contributions from our city partners. We welcome these discussions. Thanks very much to the entire MIDD staff and DCHS for the hard work that has gone into this list of recommendations 219 of 29O1 8406Appendix O Name: David Coffey Organization: RecoveryCafe Comment: I applaud King County for including Recovery Cafe in M IDD ll. Everyday here at the Cafe I see people transforming their lives- staying drug and alcohol free and stabilizing their mental health to embrace a life of wellness. Thank you King County for investing in this incredible program. Name: Leesa Manion Organization: Prosecuting Attorney's Office Comment: Please consider adding additional funding to the FIRS concept to allow this innovative and effective program to operate at full capacity as a non-secure, pre-booking, pre-filing juvenile diversion program for youth, many of whom, are struggling with chemical dependency and mental health challenges that cause them to lash out physically against parents or siblings. The $700,000 allocated in the Draft MIDD ll f unding and Programmatic Recommendations is not enough to adequately serve the 400 or more youth a year that FIRS can effectively divert out of the criminal justice system. Name: Patricia Sayed Organization: None Comment: One purpose of the mission team of my faith community, of which I am a member, is to research organizations which may need help in maintaining their programs for the homeless, addicted and those with mental health problems. With this in mind, I want the King County Council to know why I definitely think the Recovery Cafe should be included in your funding decisions. First, the work of the Cafe saves the county money by reducing the number of 911 calls, emergency room visits, and police interventions because they give people meals, support, friendship, and other opportunities for healing and safety. Their many classes offer people dealing with homelessness, addiction, and other mental health challenges opportunities to learn anger management, yoga, meditation, and others for stress reduction and emotion regulation. Thank you for considering my comments, Patricia Sayed Name: Dan McDougall-Treacy Organization: Valley Cities Comment: Please reconsiderthe planned 33% reduction in funding for Wraparound. I know the impending availability of Medicaid funding presents an apparent opportunity to shift funds elsewhere. BUT: the Medicaid reimbursement elsewhere in the state has not been able to cover costs; the state requires King to drastically increase the number of Medicaid youth receiving wraparound in the future. Over the lifespan of the MIDD ll funding, the service level for all Wraparound youth will gradually degrade. 220 of 2901 8406 Appendix O Name: Lea Ennis Organization: King Co. Superior Court Comment: We are very concerned about the lack of funding for the FIRS respite center. We will be opening this non-secure, residential option for youth involved with family violence case in July of 2016. Without the full funding requested in our proposal we will have to shut down the residential component and revert to booking youth into detention. The respite center provides a mechanism for youth to receive services without spending time in secure detention and entering the juvenile justice system. lt is also a resource for law enforcement since some youth do not meet the detention intake criteria. Name: Teresa Perillo Organization: Recovery Cafe Comment: We are grateful to be able to be part of the MIDD program, we believe it has been very helpfulfor our members that we serve! Name: Stephen DeChiaro Organization: Recovery Cafe Comment: I support the initial draft MlDDll program for Recovery Cafe Name: Derek Franklin Organization: Mercer lsland Youth & Family Services Comment: MIYFS recently partnered with the U.W. Center for the Study of Health and Risk Behaviors to create a novel, on-line individualized normative feedback tool for high school aged youth. This tool allows youth to take a short on-line survey that provides them immediate feedback on their drug and alcohol (and potentially mental health) risk in relation to risks of their peers (normative feedback let's youth know if, for example, drinking 5 beers a weekend is \"normal\" or not among peer their age--it is not normative behavior in King County but many youth think it is), MIYFS funded the first phase of this study. lt needs approximately SSOI< for the next phase. Once completed it can be implemented to youth across the county for almost no cost, except for local schools or human service organizations helping upload local normative data into the system so local youth can see how they compare not only to peers across the county, but to peers in their own school. This is prevention tool that has been studied at UW-- its efficacy can be best explained by Dr. Jason Kilmer. lt is an extremely cost effective prevention tool that borrows from Motivational lnterviewing and SBIRT. Youth who take the quick survey are given feedback about their substance use issues, where to get help, linked to educational videos, etc. 221 o'f 2901 8406 Name: Carrie Rubenstein Organization: Swedish Medical CenterAppendix O Comment: I am a family physician and Geriatrician in Seattle. The services funded by this program/budget are critical for many of our vulnerable elder populations. please continue this important funding. Name: Anne Nelsen Organization: None Comment: I first volunteered (and became a donor) at the Recovery Cafe two years ago. My charge wasto be a Minister of Presence, a concept quite foreign to me at the time, though not now. lt is to be present, to be \"there,\" in whatever capacity is needed. lt is an extraordinary charge, but one that I seefulfilled by staff and volunteers at the cafe every day I am there. To be there, to meet needs, to listen, to support, to care, to grieve when necessary, to challenge, to celebrate, to love unconditionally. To walk into the Cafe is to walk into an embracing warmth like no other: a safe place, a nurturing place, a place of fresh starts and healing. To me, the Cafe is the most remarkable place I have encountered \u00a1n decades of volunteering. I see a motivated, profoundly caring staff, volunteers who are drawn into the experience ever more powerfully, members who are thriving and caring for each other, This incredibly innovative organization is most worthy of public support. lt is not magic, but it is possibly as close to that as is humanly possible. Name: Officer Sam Cook #6325 Organization: Seattle policeDepartment Comment: I just want to say that I really support the work and good people at the Recovery Caf\u00e9. lstrongly encourage a continued partnership between them and the MIDD. Name: DorothyTrueblood Organization: Valley Cities BHO Comment: I have always been thankfulthat MIDD covered families with private or no insurance and for those who have two systems that did not necessarily include mental health. With decreased funding, those things would be gone, which would likely increase the cost in other areas, such as criminal, ER visits, etc. Name: David Bales Organization: Washington State Criminal Justice Training Commission Comment: I am supportive of continued funding for Law Enforcement and first responder Crisis lntervention training. First responders are the only service consistently available to respond to incidents 222 of 2901 8406 Appendix O of people in mental health crisis in the community, where they are, during the crisis- and 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The opportunity to leverage virtually ALL of the other identified programs and interventions starts with having first responders who understand the concepts of CIT as well as the resources that are available. We see all around the countrythe results of first responders not havingthis training, knowledge and skill. We are ahead of the curve in King County but we are also in the midst of a hiring spike that the police profession hasn't seen in over 30 years- a significant number of officers are retiring and we MUST train the new ones. I strongly support full continued funding for CIT training for first responders. The need is not diminishing. Name: Lily Anderson Organization: King County Step-Up Program Comment: The addition of a Respite Center component to the Family lntervention Restorative Services program at Juvenile Court is a sensible and purposeful way to significantly reduce the number of youth in detention and the criminal justice system. lt will provide more opportunity and time for youth and families to safety plan, learn family violence prevention skills and engage in restorative process to begin re-building relationships. Parents and youth will gain strategies to prevent further violence in the home. lf our court, county and community is committed to keeping these youth out of the criminaljustice system, this is an attainable and meaningful way to make it happen. Name: RubyTakushi Organ\u00a1zat\u00a1on: RecoveryCafe Comment: I am on the board and staff at Recovery Cafe, Everyday I see the crucial role the Cafe plays in providing recovery support to men and women in our community struggling to heal from homelessness, trauma, mental illness, and addiction. Name: Elizabeth Trautman Organization: YouthCare Comment: Thank you for the opportunity to comment on Programmatic Recommendations for MIDD ll Funding. YouthCare is appreciative of the inclusive community process and deep thought that went into forming these recommendations, and are supportive of both the program categories, and the specific strategies and recommendations within each category. ln particular, we are supportive of the following interventions that we feel will greatly benefit the homeless, unstably housed, and system-involved young people we serve. PRI-Vll- Mental Health First Aid -we hope that youth providers can access this training, as our staff can serve as first responders to youth who are decompensating. CD-ll - Youth and Young Adult Homelessness Servlces - We believe this strategy provides the necessary supports to ensure we can safely provide housing services to youth with acute behavioral health needs.a o 223 of 2901 8406Appendix O ' CD-VIl - Multipronged opioid Strategies - we are hopeful that these strategies also consider the needs of homeless youth and young adults. ' CD-IX - Behavioral Health Urgent Care Walkin Clinic Pilot - This proposed pilot meets a huge need in our community, and we hope our young adult clients might access these services. ' CD-XVIl - Youth Mental Health ASD This list isn't intended to be exhaustive, as we see many positive elements in the proposed funding list, and look forward to ensuring that our community's homeless youth, young adults, and theirfamilies have the behavioral health supports they need to successfully move beyond homelessness into thriving adulthood. Name: Rachelle Wright Organization: CIT-King COProgram, WSCJTC Comment: I like that some of the current programs are still being considered for MIDD ll. please look at continuing the CIT training for first responders as we have just begun the process of implementation of Corrections and Fire/EMS into the training program. With the implementation of new users to the training courses, it has also increased our tra\u00edning need across the county, and we will work as hard as we can to meet that need. We are also looking at new ways to develop sustainability w\u00a1h first responders so that the training continues and collaboration with resources like the MHp, DMHp, hospitals, courts, etc. continues and is strong across the county. We also value the resources available in King County and find the communication and education on resources such as GRAT, CCORS, and King County Mental Health Court have brought a lot of light to available resources many first responders did not know even existed. As a result with more of ourtraining, it has caused a rise in their need to support the referrals from first responders. Please suppoft those crisis resources as they are extremely valuable partners. During MIDD ll I would like to expand implementation of training to also include security and otherfirst responders (e.g. Emergency room personnel), transit security, and more to continue to grow the program even further. Name: Mary Taylor Organization: King County Step Up program Comment: The draft recommendations do not provide the full funding for FIRS. FIRS is a respite center model - a non-secu re 24/7 receiving facility that eliminates the need for detention bookings on the majority of family violence cases. The approach represents an entirely new way of doing business, keeping kids out of detention and providing services at the time of crisis. I have been involved in the planning of FIRS since the spring of 201,4 as the supervisor of the step up program. Having a physical location to temporarily house the teens, while connecting the family to services and developing safety plans, is the most critical element of the proposal. Without full funding, King County will miss a valuable opportunity supported by the community and juvenile justice professionals, to truly make a difference in an immediate way in the lives of youth and their families, Name: Kelly Ebels Organization: None Comment: Great to see some really helpful and innovative programs being funded. I have heard from several participants in the LEAD program about how positive their experience is and their motivation to 224 of2901 8406 Appendix O stick with the program, I hope it continues to expand. I see new funding for the Recovery Cafe. I am very pleased to see this. I am a volunteer, supporter, and fan of the Recovery Cafe. I have heard countless stor\u00a1es of struggle and have heard and seen improvement in people's lives through the supportive services offered at the Recovery Cafe. This organization offers crucial support for people struggling with trauma, mental illness, addiction, poverty, and homelessness. The Recovery Cafe uses resources, including volunteers, more effectively than any organization I have ever been involved with. They will stretch this funding far. For this reason, I would like to see their work better funded by the county. I hope that revisions to the MIDD budget will include an increase in funding of their efforts. For example, I see that S800k is budgeted for a peer support pilot, While I have no doubt that this is important work, I wonder why this pilot is receiving significantly more funding than the Recovery Cafe, an organization that already incorporates peer support into all of their programming. The day-to-day engagement with people from the community by the Recovery Cafe significantly responds to the needs identified not only in the recovery and reentry strategy area, but also in the strategy areas of crisis diversion and prevention and intervention. This is a key program that deserves significant support. Please consider increasing funding for the Recovery Cafe in revisions to the budget. Thank you again for funding important community programs and organizations like the Recovery Cafe to invest in improving the lives of people in our community.

I fully support the Caf\u00e9 receiving MIDD funds, and I respectfully request that the MIDD program consider increasing the proposed funding for the Caf\u00e9 to provide it with the support necessary to open and operate a Caf\u00e9 in South King County. Name: Amy Worthington Organization: Recovery Cafe Board Member Comment: As a Recovery Cafe board member I was thrilled to learn this organization is still being considered for MIDD support. Recovery Cafe is one of but a very few programs that truly helps people with addition clean and soberforthe long run, which is a cost savings for King County in the long run. There is a great recent report that supports this claim that the Department of Public Health has seen. Not only should MIDD support this organization, the amount of support should be greater than currently indicated, lt's a smart investment of public dollars and is a cost savings in the fight against addiction in the long run and big picture. 225 o'f 2901 8406Appendix O Name: Angela Wolle Organization: None Comment: I am delighted to see that the Recovery Cafe is included in this.

Recovery Cafe offers a unique setting for members in recovery. Without a safe place to go, to be known and to work daily on recovery and mental wellness, individuals struggling with mental illness and substance addiction are lonely, lost, isolated and at very high risk of relapse. I have been in primary care for over 20 years and have worked with many patients that may get short term treatment but there is noth\u00a1ng to hold them and support them as they leave the treatment program and relapse inevitably occurs again and again. The Cafe model is simply incredible and offers radical hospitality, accountability, support for those in recovery. lt is the vital missing piece on the recovery journey which so many need. I often say I wish there were a Recovery Cafe (instead of a Starbuck's) on every corner because it too serves great coffee but offers something much more important for all of us, a place of healing and hope for every single person that walks through the doors--members, donors, volunteers all receive so much from this incredible model. Please fund Recovery Cafe, it is a modelthat will be replicated across the country and Seattle will be proud that we continue to offer innovative solutions for those struggling with mental illness and addiction. Name: Patric\u00a1a Song Organization: None Comment: Please include Recovery Cafe in the MIDD. I have been a weekly volunteer teacher at the Cafe for over four years and can attest to the miraculous work they are doing there. They are a true, bright light in our community. MIDD funding will help to ensure that they are able to continue their life- changing, transformative work. I am convinced that Recovery Cafe is a most effective model for the highest positive change in the world. 226 o'\u00cd2901 8406 Appendix O Name: John Morefield Organization: None Comment: I was a volunteer at Recovery Cafe for over a year and in that time I was continually amazed at the quality of care provided to some of the most marginalized in our society. Day after day the remarkable staff goes the extra mile to insure quality service for their clients/customers. Dental care, quality delicious food, AA groups, yoga classes, employment counseling...the list just goes on and on. This past Monday I was visiting a prisoner in the Pierce County jail.

Thank you Name: William Schipp Organ\u00a1zat\u00a1on: Juvenile Court Services Comment: King County Juvenile Justice Assessment Team Response to MIDD ll Funding Recommendations May 2016 The Programmatic Recommendations for MIDD ll Number PR1-11, Juvenile Justice Youth Behavioral Health Assessments, dated 4/28/201.6 provides for a proposed budget of 5500,000, which is substantially less than the amount at which the Juvenile Justice Assessment Team (JjAT) is currently funded (- S0g, S20). With program enhancements that would increase clinical services to youth from assessment through referral and enrollment, the amount requested from MIDD ll is $730, 227 of2901 8406Appendix O 650'00. Absent these enhanced serv\u00a1ces, it appears that the program would be funded at a rate lower than currently funded, which would greatly impact the program's ability to meet the needs of our youth and the court, as well as our ability to meet the target numbers required. To date, JJAT has served over 2500 unique youth through its screening, assessment, consultation and referralto community based services, For each year of MIDD L, JJAT has met or exceeded its targets for screenings (GAIN Short Screener and Trauma Screenings), mental health and chemical dependency assessments, psychological evaluations, and made numerous referrals to community based services for psychiatric and neuropsychological evaluations. We provide cross disciplinary consultations for Juvenile Court Services staff, as well as community partners working with our youth. As the number of youth referred for filings and the number of youth held in secure detention continue to decline, thanks to the many Alternatives t'o Secure Detention (ASD) opportunities, the severity of Behavioral Health and Substance Use Disorder affected youth increase proportionately. JJATserves this population and cannot continue to provide the required services if we are funded at a level where we cannot sustain current staffing levels. Fully staffed, JJAT is comprised of a L.0 FTE Program Coordinator, a .8 FTE ClinicalPsychologist,2.5 FTE Mental Health Liaisons, and L.0 FTE Chemical Dependency Liaison, Historically, we have also relied upon 1'0 FTE contracted on a fee for service basis through a community based agency. With our target for Mental Health Assessments set at L40/MIDD year, each Mental Health staff is expected to complete approximately 56 assessments, Our Chemical Dependency assessment target is set at L65 assessments per year, and each Chemical Dependency Liaison is expected to complete approximately 83 assessments. Reductions in staff would greatly impact not only our ability to meet these targets, it would also result in feweryouth being served. With the recent Behavioral Health lntegrat\u00a1on changes that have been implemented just recently, it is not clinically sound to continue to conduct assessments under the old system of separate Mental Health and Chemical Dependency structure. Under the guidance of our Clinical Psychologist and with input from the King County Behavioral Health and Recovery Division, Department of Community and Health Services, JJAT has developed an integrated Behavioral Health Assessment Tool and programmatic approach to completing assessments and evaluations for referred youth, This tool and approach will look at the clinical needs of the whole child, provide diagnoses where appropriate, and make recommendations that will address the complete Behavioral Health needs of the young person. This approach will assist youth from initial screening, through assessment, referralto services and ongoing clinical oversight to assure that the youth is receiving the necessary services. Serving as a suppolt to the youth, family, the court and the community based agencies, our clinician will provide this additional service to further ensure progress in treatment, family preservation, and compliance with court requirements. At a time when the availability of in- patient Substance Use Disorder resources has decreased significantly, the court is seeing an increase in the number of Opioid Use Disorders and Amphetamine Use Disorders among the youth referred for evaluation and assessment. While some of these youth may benefit from enhanced Juvenile Drug Court Services, not all youth are able to participate in these services. From a Behavioral Health approach to these issues, it is difficult to address the comprehensive needs of the youth and family from a standard Juvenile Couft Services approach. These youth need the additional clinicaloversight to ensure success, enhancements and fine tuning to clinical case plans when needed, and additional clinical support to increase familial involvement and ultimately a successful treatment experience, JJAT has seen an increase in the number of referrals for youth involved in Truancy actions in the court. While some may believe that any youth involved in the Juvenile Justice System is beyond the scope of preventions services, it is our experience that these youth, as well as those involved in At Risk Youth petitions, are in a particularly vulnerable position to become involved in the well-publicized \"school to prison pipeline,\" in which youth rapidly progress from schoolfailures to criminal activities, often with lifelong consequences. JJAT intervention, with Behavioral Health recommendations at this stage may serve to reduce the causes behind truant behavior and familialdysfunction and prevent furtherJuvenile Justice 228 of 2901 8406 Appendix O System involvement. A reduction in funding for the Juvenile Justice Assessment Team will have a direct impact on staff and resources that will hinder JJAT's ability to provide the scope of these necessary services. Our proposed programmatic enhancements cannot effectively be implemented absent the funding for these services, A reduction of over 563,000 from our current funding level will decrease our ability to provide the kind of cross-disciplinary approach mandated through Behavioral Health lntegration. Please consider fully funding the Juvenile Justice Assessment Team at its requested budget levels. Name: Mike Heinisch Organization: Kent Youth and Family Services Comment: Thank you for the opportunity to provide public comment on the initial draft funding and programmatic recommendations. And for the vast amount of work, by staff, stakeholders, the public, and many, manyothersto movethe MIDD Reviewand ll Funding and Programmatic Focus Areas\" and \"Key MIDD ll Assumptions\" capture well the community voices and priorities as well as the current environment, 20L6v.2008, as the County embarks on MIDD ll. I am particularly pleased to see the inclusion of \"upstream prevention and diversion activities;\" \"treatment on demand;\" \"community driving grants processes so geographic and culturally diverse communities can customize behavioral health services for their unique needs.\" The overarching MIDD ii framework \"strategies\" that seems to be well designed to implement to the extent MIDD ll resources are available those focus areas. lwould encourage a cautious approach to the MIDD ll assumptions that \"leveraged Medicaid replaces MIDD funding.,.\" Previous such assumptions with the implementation of federal ACA and Washington healthplanfinder Exchange were overly optimist, particularly for SUD leveraged Medicaid treatment, and has led to continuing extensive financial stress, if not actual continuing crisis, in the publicly funded SUD treatment services and providers. Even with the recognition of needing to get the leverage Medicaid assumptions \"right is so important\" that KC has engaged a consulting firm to review, be very cautious and very conservative with these assumptions. They can always be revised should they prove to be wrong in a favorable direction for the County and the providers and clients access to services. lt will no doubt be much more difficult if not impossible should the assumptions prove to be wrong in an unfavorable direction however. On the \"lnitial Draft MIDD ll Funding Programmatic Recommendations: Overall it appears to me that more thought needs to be given to which MIDD ll Framework Strategies each MIDD ll lnitiative Title is best placed. This is particularly true for the \"systems lmprovement\" Framework Strategy MIDD ii lnitiatives listed under Systems lmprovement. I am very pleased to see the New Zero Suicide lnitiative Pilot. Very timely with the continuing population (demographic) wide escalations in suicide attempts/completions. The New Youth and Young Adult Homelessness lwould hope willwork in close coordination with BSK's Youth and Youth Adult and Families Homelessness lnitiative. Also I would like to see consideration of a significant proposed budget increase forthe initiative title. Fully endorse the New Law Enforcement Assisted Division (LEAD) into MIDD ll. lwould hope that LEAD efforts will be extended to none hot spots throughout the County, particularly of course here in SKC. New Behavioral Health Urgent Care-Walk ln Clinic, while lam supportive lwould encourage a clearand distinct differentiation between the MIDD ll lnitiative (and MIDD lStrategy) Next Day Appointments. \"NDA's\", long a feature of the mental health center system, understandably are agency based and have always been a valued immediate crisis intervention/prevention. The should remain so and be a very important part of MIDD ll. Seemly be cautious to differentiate between this New Urgent Care-Walk ln and NDA's, Fully support New Family lntervention Restorative Services - FIRS. What has been developed with MIDD llfund balance funding 229 o'n 290I 8406Appendix O (as well as the long exist\u00a1ng \"Step Up\" Program) has proven to be a very successful intervention with these youth who are violent towards a family member. Fully support New Youth Mental Health Alternative to Secure Detention, So many of these Alternatives to Secure Detention efforts were originally implemented and demonstrated early positive results after the adoption of JJOMp in the late 1-990s/early 2000s and then abandoned due to budget constraints. We are well past time ASD's should be restored as a proven effective part of the services system. I have some concerns and urge careful consideration of MIDD ll lnitiative Titles: Housing Capitaland Rental, New Rapid Rehousing-Oxford House Model, Housing Vouchers for Adult Drug Court. Coordinate closely with All Home on these, if eventually implemented, My caution, particular with making MIDD ll (or MIDD I initially for that matter) is that there are significant other \"pots\" for access to capitalfor housing, albeit not enough forthe need being experience in the Crisis of Homelessness\" in King County. I am not in favor of MIDD being looked to repeatedly for access to capital for housing. Fully support New Recovery Caf\u00e9. I realize that it may appear unusualor otherwise bias/favoritism to one part\u00a1cular agency. However Recovery Caf\u00e9 has proven itself with complex chronically mentally ill and SUD individuals well deserving of being called out as a MIDD ll lnitiative. New South County Crisis Diversion Services/Center would be a huge benefit to all MH/SUD involved systems and providers in SKC. From first responders through treatment providers, schools, family members, etc. of individuals in crisis as a preventative and pre-full blown crisis. Similar to my comments on the New Behavioral Health Urgent Care-Walk in Clinic Pilot, I urge clear differentiation between the SKC Crisis Diversion Center and the Urgent Care-Walk in. I would not want, nor would any of us in SKC I trust, a dilution of the SKC Crisis Diversion Center simply because there is a (perceived duplication of services) with the Walk in Center. Supportive of the New Behavioral Health Services in Rural King County lnitiative. Thank you, on behalf of SKC unincorporated residents for its inclusion. Thank you again for the opportunity to comment. Continue the fine work on the MIDD ll processes. Name: Judge Lisa O'Toole Organization: King County District Court Comment: Dear MIDD Oversight Group, I am a Judge in King County District Court, East Division, I am writing to urge King County to allocate MIDD funding to combat the drastic increase in heroin addiction that we see here in King County. The number of defendants that we see in District Court who are heroin addicts is truly staggering. Each and every week here in Redmond I see dozens of defendants who are heroin addicts. One of the remarkable things aboutthis is that not only do lsee defendants charged with crimes that one might expect of a heroin addict, such as Driving Under the lnfluence (of heroin) or Possession of Drug Paraphernalia, but I also see defendants charged with other crimes such as theft and assault, including domestic violence. So very often the genesis of the criminal activity is the addiction, Many of the people in the criminal justice system who are heroin addicts are indigent and without stable housing. Without stable housing it is nearly impossible for these individuals to participate in, and be successful in, substance use disorder treatment. I urge King County to use MIDD funding to prevent further needless deaths due to heroin overdoses and to combat increasing risks to public safety. ldeally, a criminaljustice diversion program in District Court would help defendants to address legal issues while engaging in treatment arranged through the program and while living in stable housing arranged through the diversion program, lrealizethatsuch a diversion program would be an expensive proposition, however. At a minimum, I urge King County to use MIDD funding to develop programs that will provide treatment and housing options for defendants in the District and Municipal courts. Thank you for your consideration. Judge Lisa O'Toole 230 of 2901 8406 Appendix O Name: Sue Shaw Organization: King County Advisory Council on Aging & Disability Services Comment: Please excuse my earlier blank submission. I am writing in support of increased funding for the Geriatric Regional Assessment Team(GRAT). As the homeless population grows and ages, it is critically important that the mental health needs of older adults are able to be met immediately. lt is totally unacceptable for our elders in King County to spend one night without shelter. We must fund the GRAT program at a level that allows immediate response to a mental health crisis among our aged in order to avoid that possibility. Name: Diana Forman Organization: None Comment: I am writing in support of including Recovery Cafe in the MIDD Tax Levy, which will be considered for renewal in November. As an organization founded to help those living on the margins of society, Recovery Cafe is a key member of the \"Reentry and Recovery\" strategy area being consider for funding. The Cafe not only provides meals to those who are struggling with homelessness and addiction but helps them find a path to recovery, self-respect, and stability. The program has won three community and State awards for its work and has become a nationally-recognized model for other communities working to end the cycle of addiction, suffering, and despair. Over the years I have been impressed and moved by the stories of Recovery Cafe members who credit the cafe with leading them to recovery and supporting their determination to remain drug-free and able to believe in themselves once again. This is a program that benefits both the recipients of the effective on-going support the Cafe and its many programs provide and the greater Seattle community as a whole. I sincerely hope that the Cafe and its remarkable leadership and staff will be selected to continue and expand their life changing work by receiving funding as part of the MIDD Tax Levy. All the best, Diana Forman, Seattle Name: KathleenSouthwick Organization: Crisis Clinic Comment: On behalf of Crisis Clinic, I want to extend our thanks to Kelli Carroll and her team for such a great job on shepherding this process and conducting the extensive community outreach. lt gives us confidence in the recommendations madel Overall, I think the recommendations were very good and build on the success of many existing programs. I understand that some new elements may be added to existing programs, but it is difficult to tell from the just the titles so I hope there will be time for more comment when the service improvement plans are developed. ln particular, Crisis Clinic supports these new initiatives: PRI-Vl: New Zero Suicide lnitiative. We are highly supportive of this new initiative and gave suggestions for program elements that we hope will be included. Our 24-Hour Crisis Line received more than 5,000 calls last year from people seriously considering suicide so we know this is an important public health issue and we applaud the county for taking a community-wide approach to building systems and supports to address this issue. We are especially excited about the plans to provide immediate follow-up support to people discharged from the hospital after a suicide attempt. This is the most vulnerable time for people and they are at a high risk for re-attempting. We have proposed a 231 o'f 2901 8406Appendix O telephone-based follow up serv\u00a1ce, along with a on-go\u00a1ng support group, both are evidence-based practices which have shown to be highly effective in reducing a future attempt. CD-IV New South County Crisis Diversion Services/Center & Sl-X New Behavioral Health Services in Rural King County. We know from the calls we receive on the 24-Hour Crisis Line and King County 211that there is a tremendous need for more services in south, southeast and rural King County, We are glad that MIDD is making this a priority. I want to address a gap in the continuum of behavioral health services that was not selected as a priority, but which is foundational to the success of the clients receiving these services. Stabilizing and Expanding Access to Community Services: King County 21L Each of the programs recommended for continued or new funding in some way depends on the effectiveness of King County 2I!, yeTthere has been no funding to help support this service through the behavioral health system. MtDD funding would provide an opportunity to remedy that. King County 211 is the county's comprehensive information and referral call center. lt also maintains the database of all the health, behavioral health and community services in King County, This is the database that case managers, ED social workers, educators, court personnel, and public safety officials depend on when they are seeking resources for their clients. For example, in April, the King County District Court judges asked for a presentatio n on 2!L because they recognized that many of those appearing before them are there because of crimes related to their poverty, mental illness and lack of housing and basic needs service. They wanted to learn more so they could refer those appearing before them to 2LITo get help. The characteristics and needs of those with behavioral health/criminaljustice challenges fit the profile/needs of 2It callers. Many probably already use 2LL services. Addressing mentalhealth/substance use disorders is significantly easier if the person has stable housing, food, transportat\u00a1on, training/employment. King County 2L1 helps them create a solid foundation from which to address their health concerns. A few of the specialized human services systems fund 211 as a key entry point to their array of services including rental assistance, family homelessness, and civil legal assistance, the new Community Living Connections program (aging and disability services) But the health/behavioral health system does not provide funding to the 2i-l system and this is a significant gap in our funding mix, especially since Medicaid clients are likely high users of 2LL' Even DCHS provides only minimal funding through the Vets and Human Services Levy. The 21\"L system is at serious risk and needs investments from MIDD, BSK and the Vet and Human Services Levy. When the County had general fund monies, 2LL received 5100,000 annually and we would like to see MIDD fund ZLL at that level. King County 211 is the 911- of the health, behavioral health and human services and it is important that the County invest to assure it can continr\u00ece to support the rest of the programs/providers funded by MIDD. Thank you Name: Jimmy Hung Organization: King County Prosecutor's Office Comment: The Family lntervention and Restorative Services (FIRS) needs to be fully funded. Currently the draft MIDD ll recommendation only f unds 57% of what is needed and provides zero funding for operations of a 24/7 respite center. The pilot FIRS respite center will open on July L, z}t6 as a result of a one time contribution from the City of Seattle. The respite center model is a non-secu re 24/7 receiving facility that eliminates the need for detention bookings on the majority of family violence cases. This model allows flexibility for families to receive respite services that are not tied to the criminaljustice system and will greatly reduce booking and formal charging. The respite center will provide a welcome resource for law enforcement as many youth who do not meet the stringent detention intake criteria are turned away and law enforcement is forced to make the difficult decision to leave the violent offender in the home with his/her victim. This often results in subsequent 911 calls for help that stra\u00a1n 232 of 2901 8406 Appendix O emergency services. Without this respite centerwe will return to the ineffective and harmful practice of booking these youth into juvenile detention. FIRS is not a concept or an idea, lt is presently a fully functioning program that is providing immediate services to youth and families in crisis and it is serving as a beacon for juvenile justice reform. lt is a partnership between the courts/prosecutors/defense/probation/law-enforcement/community that has never been seen in King County. lt is a program that bucks the county's reputation as an entitythat just likes totalka biggame, but takes no action. A failure to fully fund FIRS will do more damage than simply being further evidence of county government's inability to act. Failing to fully fund FIRS will harm youth and families, and will make our communities less safe. Name: Mike Graham-Squire Organization: Neighborhood House Comment: One thing that is working and a gap that I do not see addressed in the summary of recommendations is that we have successful prevention coalitions in that provide early intervention and prevention services howeverthese coalitions currently only serve a handfulof communities and the funding provided does not cover the full costs of providing the service. These types of coalitions are proven effective through the communities that care model, Drug Free Communities Program, and CPWI. King County should use MIDD funds to expand these coalitions to additional communities in King County and use MIDD funds to cover the cash match and indirect costs required to run these coalitions that are currently not paid for by state or county dollars. This funding gap has prevented King County from being able to start new coalitions and threatens the sustainability of existing ones. A small investment in this area can leverage 7 state dollars for every 1- dollar invested by MIDD funding as well as have a long term return on investment by preventing future addiction and delinquent behavior. Name: John Ciochon Organization: None Comment: The Recovery Cafe should be needs to be included in the MIDD, The Cafe is a vital part of mental health recovery in greater Seattle area, Name: Angela Heald Organization: Asian Counseling and Referral Service Comment: The are a lot of great programs/funding recommended. Crisis Diversion initiatives L,2,4,7,8 seem especially important, as do housing supports in RR-2,4,5, I am concerned however about the significant cut to ClTfunding given that SPD and otherfirst responders play such a crucial role in diverting consumers to appropriate services and away from the criminaljustice system. Without proper training this has potentialto create tragic situations (as it has in the past). lt is great that the proposal includes funding PRI-7 to essentially create community first responders. A few other areas of concern to me are the cut to GRAT given the rapid increase in the elderly population and the high likelihood of increased need for their services; the cut to supported employment programming given that meaningful work is important for recovery; and the amount available for non-Medicaid funding of MH given that the 233 012901 8406Appendix O current funding level is very quickly exhausted given the high level of need for these consumers. Finally, I'd like to comment that in community mental health we struggle constantly with funding training to create good providers but lose most of the investment as they move on to better positions. The funding of caseload reduction and workforce development is crucial in this perpetual struggle, Name: Cathy Callans Organization: None Comment: I would like to recommend that the Recovery caf\u00e9 be a recipient of some of these funds. I worked as an intern there for two years and now that I am a licensed mental health counselor, I continue to recommend the caf\u00e9 to many of my clients. The mission of the caf\u00e9 fills a need in the city that is not met by any other agency in the same way. lt truly is a school of \"transformation\" and works hard to move people along on their journeys back to recovery and independence and healing. They offer their members a \"hand up\" as opposed to a \"hand out\" which I believe instills a sense of self efficacy, self-respect and dignitythat is hard tofind in otherorganizations helpingthis same population. They promote kinship there like no other place I have worked. lt provides a community of loving caring individuals who are all working together to enhance the lives of one another.

Name: Katherine Mclntyre Organization: None Comment: Please support the Recovery Cafe, it's changed the lives of so many people I know in a positive way. Name: Donna Tucker Organization: King County District Court Comment: Considering the MIDD Policy Goal 1- and 2 to reduce the number of mentally ill and chemically dependent people using costly interventions such as jail and further considering the current opiate crisis along with the highest property crime rates in the nation - it is difficult to understand why there is no recommendation to expand therapeutic courts in King County. The King County Executive's commitment to the people of King County is to invest in what works and to apply proven approaches that produce remarkable results, Studies of therapeutic community courts at the San Francisco Community Justice Center, at the Neighborhood Justice Center in Yarra, Melbourne Australia, and the Red Hook Community Justice Center in New York are all showing successful results. The National lnstitute on Drug Abuse revised report from April 201-4 on the Principles of Drug Abuse Treatment for 244 o'n 2901 8406 Appendix O the CriminalJustice Populations provides a research-based guide in providing effective treatment for offenders suffering from chemical dependence and/or mental health conditions. The research shows that a large percentage of those admitted to drug abuse treatment cite legal pressure as an important reason for seeking treatment. Most studies suggest that outcomes for those who are legally pressured to enter treatment are as good as or better than outcomes for those who entered treatment without legal pressure, lndividuals under legal pressure also tend to have higher attendance rates and remain in treatment for longer periods, which can also have a positive impact on treatment outcomes. A local treatment educator explained that \"forced treatment\" does work because dealing with addiction in treatment will ultimately require the individual to deal with really difficult areas in their lives and when entering into treatment without an 'outside force', like the courts or threat of criminal conviction, it is much easier to abandon treatment and walk away. Therapeutic community courts provide not only the incentive but also the guidance and support system needed for drug addicted and mentally ill individuals who are committing crimes to address their underlying issues. Unfortunately, in King County there are many individuals in the criminaljustice system with untreated addictions/mental illness who have engaged in misdemeanor and gross misdemeanor criminal activity, while under the influence and/or done to support the addiction. These criminal activities put others in the community at risk for harm to persons or property. For way too long, the only response available has been the use of jail with very little resources to provide real help to address the underlying problems to the criminal behavior. MIDD funding has the ability to recognize this reality and make a change by supportingand/or expanding the existing therapeutic courts and reaching more of those in desperate need, though the development of a therapeutic community court with the King County District Court.

I run with the running club, \"Sole Train,\" and hear people attest to how this healthy activity has helped them eat better, calm the voices in their head, and just help them feel better all around. The Cafe addresses a population that has exhausted or never had the support of family and friends. When there is no place else to go, people can come to the Cafe and find immeidate loving care. Health food, a Circle that helps them be accountable, and access to meditation, art, writing classes and more that help heal the whole body, not just \"fix\" a temporary problem.

Name: Joseph Sparacio Organization: Neighborcare under MIDD I initiatives: 1.g.) Prevention/early intervention mental health and substance abuse services for older adults, and 4.c,) Schooldistrict based mentalhealth and substance abuse services. Thisfunding has allowed usto provide very specific, focused treatment for older clients as well as population-based strategies in the schools, which can then be complemented by group or individual therapy for those.students m\u00f3st in need. We are grateful to the MIDD Oversight Committee for their recognition of the significant, life-saving work being done in these areas and their commitment to include a similar focus in MIDD ll funding. As Neighborcare Health continues to refine its behavioral health program to respond to the needs we see in our community, increased access is a continualconcern. To that end, we are introducing even further integration of SBIRT, MAT, and brief intervention focused behavioral health into our primary care model, and bringing services to locations such as supportive housing, schools, and our homeless clinic locations. These creative approaches aim to reduce barriers to accessing services and provide care to patients along the entire continuum of need. lt is our hope that MIDD ll will include flexibility in service provision, such as models other than MHIP, to allow organizations to respond to populations-specific needs more efficiently a nd effectively. Name: Ahmed Ali Organization: Somali Health Board Comment: Overall, the budget looks fine, however, I think the NEW Community Driven Behavioral Health Grants (Sl-lX)should be allocated more funding in providing technicalassistance, evaluation and support with community initiated behavioral health programs. I should also point out that due to strong stigma associated with mental/behavioral health within certain ethnic communities, self driven, grassroot efforts such as the Somali Health Board should be given direct access to funding ratherthan larger organizations that receive findings simply by stating they're culturally competent. Small CBOs with a proven track record of working within the community should be encouraged and financially supported on their work - in order to better serve the community on such needed work. MIDD number Sl-lV, peer to peer training is a great model that I see can work really in limited English proficiency communities- it's a pilot, anticipated and hope to see it materialize. I'm also encouraged by the Parent Partners Family Assistance, l'd suggest increasingthe funding in that area - $LM, simply because l'm aware of the direct positive impact it has with getting families support their loved and reducing stigmatization. 252 of 290I 8406 Name: Abdul Karim Taifour Organization: NoneAppendix O GRAT Name: Pratima Lakhotia Organization: None Comment: Please do not decrease the clubhouse funding of Hero House. lt is the only organization in King County that provides a non-clinical way of recovery to mentally ill patients and provides them the ability to get a job. Save Hero House by not decreasing the funding. Name: Savinay Dangi Organization: Hero House, Secretary Comment: Proposed clubhouse funding of $230K for Hero House is 36% reduction from the current budget of 362K. This is extremely low and will make the Hero House in Bellevue unsustainable. Hero House is unique in King County as we are the only organization that provides a non-clinical approach to mental illness recovery and help them get a job. Hero House offers a very diversity rich environment to support the diverse community of King County. Lastly, the proposed decrease of funding for IPS Supported employment will directly impact the ability of recovering patients to get back into employment. We need the funding for Clubhouse and Supported Employment to increase so we can serve more. Name: Sandy Nisperos Organization: Asian Counseling and Referral Service Comment: I support increased $ to IVtOO ll. AT ACRS we serve the community of non-English speaking Asian/Pacific lslanders who suffer from serious mental illnesses. Many of these people don't have the resources to apply for Medicaid. Due to the MIDD ll funding, we can serve this population and get them the services they need such as mental health counseling, medication management, case management,.,,,....and more delivered to them in their own Asian language. Please increase the funding for the MIDD ll so that we can serve more of the population that needs services. ln add\u00a1ton, we help these clients get jobs through our Supported Employment program, so please increase funding for this through the MIDD ll. Name: Deb Lewy Organization: HERO House Comment: Hello, Here are my comments on the initial draft MIDD ll program and budget recommendations: (1) For clubhouse funding, the county is suggesting SZ3O,OOO per year serving 20/30 253 of 290I 8406 Appendix O members per day. This is extremely LOW since at HERO House, we serve this number of members already and our budget for MIDD is currently $36Z,OOO a year. (2) HERO House is a unique organization in King County because it is the only clubhouse that is accredited by Clubhouse lnternationaland it also includes the IPS Supported Employment Program. HERO House provides a non-clinical approach to recovery which puts people back to work and keeps them there. We increase access to community services through our clubhouse supports such as bus passes, the SE program, and our education program, )3) At HERO House, our staff represents the community we serve at large. Our staff provides support in morethan eight languages. This creates a diverse culture and is reflected in ourcontinued growth for members and staff. (4) For IPS Supported Employment, the county has suggested S950,OOO per year, Th\u00a1s is $50,000 less than the previous year. ln order to expand the IPS program within the county, this shortfall will negatively impact how many individuals we are able to serve, Last year, allT IPS programs (including HERO HOUSE)served approximately 1,000 individuals combined in employment. All of the funds were used. The county cannot and should not expect to increase the employment rate among individuals with mental illness by decreasing the funding by $50,0000, Thank you for allowing the feedback and for serving the community of adults who live with mental illness. Deb Lewy President, HERO House Board of Directors Name: Michelle Vance Organization: DSHS - APS Comment: Our main service that we have a close working relationship with is the Geriatric Regional Assessment Team. They have provided excellent services in assessing seniors with a mental health crisis and I feelthat this service is essential to APS and the community at whole. Without their assessments, it would be difficult to obtain the information on the cognitive limitations of vulnerable adults and to determine the need for APS to file a guardianship if warranted. Name: Sue Bunn Organization: None Comment: As a geriatric case manager with a masters degree in mental health counseling, I have seen first hand the amazing work done by the GRAT program, lt is very clear to me that clients who otherwise would have been hospitalized or a significant threat to themselves or others have been provided stabilizing services not offered by any other program. The GRAT team rocks and should be give a very high funding priority. Name: Gary Bright Organization:. DSHS/HCS/APS Comment: I have been an Adult Protective Services worker going into my 16th year, and 1-0 years in Children's Administration. I have seen a variety of programs come and go over the years with varying results. I wish to give an editorial comment on GRAT and the need to continue this very appropriate program for the King County geriatric population. ln contrast to King County, Snohomish County does not have such a program with direct service delivery. Absent GRAT, APS social workers will have to fall 254 of 290I 8406 Appendix O back on RCW 71.05.1-53 \"Emergent detention of persons with mentaldisorders\" to request police to involuntarily take a person to an emergency room for a mental health evaluation. Herein lies the problem: Without good information to show the vulnerable adult is gravely disabled and in a setting impacting their health and welfare, a Mental Health Professional is more likely to release the person after ER contact. GRAT has been extremely helpful networking with APS and other agencies to help establish a need for additional intervention. Early intervention means a cost savings to the immediate medical, long term care and governing health care authorities which provides quality of life to vulnerable adults in King County. Losing GRAT means one less link in the chain of agencies that assist gravely disabled people in need. On my wish list is a request for GRAT to expand their program to include Snohomish County as well. I know, \"lf wishes were horses, beggars would ride.\" My wish remains for GRAT to help us here in Snohomish County as well. A case example may help to illustrate: An elderly lady was assigned to me in south King County some years back. There was also an administrative lock on the case. ln addition to the extra security required to address the case confidentiality concerns internally, GRAT involvement during this case was extremely helpful as a credible, reliable and relevant source of information gathered from the alleged victim, alleged perpetrator and other non-professional witnesses. GRAT helped with baseline information to provide a positive outcome for this case. The GRAT model is invaluable. As Washington State is one of the top states which heads the nation in quality of care to vulnerable adults, so is King County the modelforthe rest of this state. Budget constraints aside, there is every reason for GRATto continue theirgood work. Please contact me if lcan be of further assistance to keep GRAT. Name: Todd Beller Organization: None Comment: I'm glad to participate in this survey. I was employed with the Geriatric Regional Assessment Team from 6/2008 - 6/2013 as their substance abuse specialist. I worked with hundreds of clients impacted with addiction and other co-occuring disorders who would have otherwise not received any support as they were significantly impacted and unable to leave their residence. The GRAT team has a significant impact in the community and offers services for people in crisis as well as clients taking care of people they love (Caregiver support) I implore you to continue this service and continue funding; it's valuable, needed and helps more than you can quantify in a spreadsheet or debate in a legislative session.

Name: Amy Sill Organization: Neighborcare Health Comment: Very, very helpful resource for our patients! Fred in Seattle is so caring and did all he could to help one of my pts. Name: Ramona Graham Organization: Center for Human Services Comment: MIDD Wraparound should not be reduced because of WlSe funding. WlSe Programming has requirements and is intensely costly as compared to the MIDD Wraparound. The funding for this program needs to remain the same in orderto continue these services to those clients who do not qualify for WlSe, but need the support of Wraparound services. Name: Karen Larsen Organization: City of Seattle Comment: GRAT provides excellent mental health assessments for my agency, Aging and Disability Services. Their assessments and expert insight into mental health disabilities give ADS counselors essential information for effective case management. This service cannot be matched. Please, forthe sake of the elderly and disabled residents we serve, do not eliminate this important piece of social service care. Name: Samantha Santor Organization: City of Seattle HSD, ADS Comment: I am writing to support continued funding for the GRAT program. We refer to GRAT on a regular basis as they are the only service that goes to see our older/homebound clients in their homes This is a vitalservice and many clients will lose access to criticalmental health services if funding is cut Please continue to fund GRAT. The system does not have the capacity to absorb this loss, 256 of 29OI 8406Appendix O Name: Kathi Church Organization: Aging GERtATRtc REGtoNAL ASSESSM ENT TEAM I (GRAT). GRAT has been invaluable to those of us in the ADS case management program who work with older adult populations, many vulnerable due to cognitive deficits and other mental health issues. GRAT clinicians and their assessments have been criticalto inform us and others involved as to options forthe client in living independently (or not), what the appropriate services would be given their challenges and strengths, and help inform those at Adult Protective Services when a guardianship is recommended due to capacity issues, etc. lf GRAT were to lose funding and were no longer able to serve the clients they do, we at ADS (and our clients) will lose an extremely valuable service. Name: Rachel Diaz Organization: Reach Comment: RE: Treatment on D\u00eamand: lt's a really great concept but I would like the actual quality of treatment to be addressed. At this point, there really are few treatment options in King County. The one's that exist do not, in general, keep up with best practices as put forth by the federal government. Most treatment facilities are entrenched in only the AA model and that leaves many people out of luck if they do not embrace that model. Many of the providers are rigid in their approaches and clients leave treatment early or relapse immediately. The lack of detox and SUFFICIENT number of days for detox is sorely lacking--many people (alcoholics, opiate users) end up starting treatment while still dealing with post acute withdrawal syndrome and they are not ready to do the hard work. They don't feel better for a good 10 plus days and are half way through treatment by the time their brain really starts to clear. Also, I have yet to hear a client tell me that they worked on coping skills around re-entry to their same housing or living situation. sorry, but our su treatment system is quite broken.

They are often the only contact that vulnerable seniors have available at a t\u00a1me of mental health crisis and their services are invaluable to our case management program in both providing clear assessment of cognitive functioning and also educating and consulting with us on difficult cases. lt would be a terrific loss to the community if this service was not to be funded. 257 o\u00cd2901 8406 Appendix O Name: Lauren Mirzakhalili Organization: REACH Comment: I believe it is absolutely necessary for the city to renew the MIDD program. There are many gaps in our city's services for those experiencing mental illness and/or drug dependency, and I believe there would be serious repercussions if the MIDD program renewalis not put into place. DSHS-APS Comment: Geriatric Regional Assessment Team(GRAT) is a much needed service and should continue to receive funding. The GRAT team is able to evaluate clients quickly and help start services in place for the client. Adult Protective Services uses GRAT services and evaluations on a weekly basis. GRAT is able to reach some of our most vulnerable elderly populations, which would normally not get services. Name: Christine lllan Organization: None Comment: Without the funding for mental health crisis, diversion and recovery support the 10,000+ homeless will continue to grow in King Co. Name: Tramanh Nguyen Organization: Asian Counseling and Referral Service Comment: As a mental health case manager for the past L0 years, I have been through many ups and downs with my clt as the funding fluated, I strongly believe that more funding should be located for non Medicaid and reduce caseload because there are still many people in the community that needs the mental health service but d/t limited of funding we cannot serve everyone who are in needs. l, myself, manyyears ago had received outpatient mental health treatment and as a result of treatment, lwas able to lift myself up, went through grad school and got my MSW and has been serving in the mental health field since 2005, if I didn't get the treatment that I have gotten, I probably not end up where I am today (back then I have made many suicides attempts). Speaking of reducing caseload, right now I have close to 50 caseload and with 40 hrs/week and some of those hours are used for meetings and other necessary trainings, I don't have much time left to meet all of my clts needs, I have to struggle w\u00a1th prioritize my clt's needs and that is very sad because some of them would have making much more progress if they get more support from me. Therefore, pls allocate more funding for non-Medicaid and reduce caseload. 258 Kim Organization: DSHS Comment: GRAT is a great resource please don't take money away from them, We need allthe mental health resources we can get. ltsvery limited and mental health issues are increasingto a hazard.

With issues like dementia, housing, and accesstoservices, ourelders are in great need of support. Please consider expanding support to seniors, Name: Brenda Abbenante Organization: APS Comment: Continue with GRAT services as they are a huge benefit to the community Name: Tom Lang Organization: None Comment: I hope funding will be continued for the GRAT. As the President of an HOA, we were very concerned about one of our elderly owners who called 911 at least 3 dozen times over about 4 months and who had signs of dementia. The advice GRAT offered was most helpful. They came out did an on- site assessment that was also valuable. We needed, and appreciated, that we had someone to call and advise us on how to deal with this owner. Name: Barbara de Michele Organization: lssaquah Schools Foundation Healthy Youth lnitiative Comment: I strongly su pport development of a treatment on demand system. For youth, please consider placing treatment on demand in public schools where access to treatment is currently woefully lacking. Young people who are experimenting or already in addiction have great difficulty accessing appropriate substance abuse counseling and referrals. We have long waiting lists for mental health counseling. School-based treatment on demand would meet these challenges effectively, saving many lives. 259 of 2901 8406Appendix O Name: Crystal Hanson-Garrett Organization: DSHS-APS Comment: This service is invaluable without it, our vulnerable population would not receive much needed services.

This service is very much needed in order for us to timely serve our aging adult population. Name: Karen Kent Organization: None Comment: I believe it is essential that GRAT continue to get MIDD money. lt is a program of great value in the community and the only one that deals specifically with isolated older adults in crisis.

Name: Diane Stone Organization: Seattle Police Department Comment: My comment is to attest to the invaluable service of the GRAT program. I work as an advocate for seniors who have been abused, neglected and or exploited. This program has been a phenomenal help to myself and the detectives that investigate the cases, The expertise, hard work, professionalism and compassion shown by the GRAT personnel is invaluable to us and to the older people that they come into contact with and serve. Please, keep this extremely valuable service to our older community up and runningl We cannot imagine our job without their expertise and assistance. Name: Denise Malm Organization: Wallingford Community Senior Center Comment: As a social worker at the Wallingford Community Senior Center, I encourage MIDD decision makers to support the Mental lllness and Drug Dependency levy/ funding. ln my job, I am noticing an increase of older adults with and without support systems in desperate need of mental health assessments, interventions and services. Too often lsee and hearfrom concerned family members, friends, professionals and neighbors regarding elders with limited resources in critical life and death situations. Personally, I have relied on the Geriatric Regional Assessment Team for help when seniors are in crisis. Professionally, I would not know what to do or who to call (other than 911) when working with an individual who is suicidal, suffering from memory loss or is incoherent. Without this funding, these situations will need to be dealt with by localfire depaftments, law enforcement and medical facilities.This put a strain on services that are already stretched beyond capacity, ultimately costing the County more in the long run. Furthermore, organization like GRAT have the knowledge and experience with aging populations. Please value seniors in need by fully funding these programs. 261 o12901 8406 Appendix O Name: Comment: GRAT is essentialto assist our community in making sure that vulnerable adults have their needs being met. All of our society benefits from their critical work, Name: Jeff Quigley Organization: DSHS Comment: Would love to see the GRAT Program funded from the MIDD ll program as it is a program which has benefitted the service structure in King Co for many years. Currently, the program is slated to go away due to Evergreen Care Network discontinuing their community service programs. Name: Rachel Wang Martinez Organization: None Comment: As a community health nurse, I have worked in partnership with GRAT many times to provide crucial services to our underserved aging population in crisis. This program is vitalto keeping our communities healthy and decreasing the burden of emergency services provided to older adults who benefit from the support provided by GRAT. Name: Janet Smith Organ\u00a1zation: Northwest Elder Law Group PLLC Comment: I feel strongly that the Geriatric Regional Assessment Team is a vital resource for frail elders in King County and should continue to be funded. This is a life saving service for elders at risk who live alone, or vulnerable elders who are being exploited by others. Please continue this funding. Name: GigiMeinig Organization: Aging and Disability Services Comment: I highly recommend the Geriatric Regional Assessment Team (GRAT) be included as a provider in the MIDD process, GRAT is one of the few Behavioral Health (mental health and substance abuse) organizations to serve older adults. ln the not so distant future, older adults will increase lo 25% of the overall population. As the demographics shift there will be a huge need for practitioners with geriatric experience, knowledge of dementia and understanding of the affects of psychotropic medications on the elderly. GRAT continues to be a leader in the field of geriatrics. Much of their work is done in the client's home. They are connected to the medical community through it's umbrella organization Evergreen Health. As a former contract specialist and agency assessor I always found GRAT's Administrative work to be high quality and appreciated their willingness to maintain flexibility 262 of 2901 8406 Appendix O regarding data collection. I strongly urge you to incorporate the needs of older adults in the MIDD planning process. Thank you. Name: Amanda Froh Organization: King County Prosecutor's Office Comment: I would encourage you to continue funding the Geriatric Regional Assessment Team. These evaluators provide cognitive assessment to elderly and vulnerable adults in crisis (such as those who are victims of the crimes of neglect and financial exploitation), and direct them into services to better their lives. As prosecutors, we often rely on cognitive assessments done by GRAT evaluators of our victims, as they are often first on the scene following discovery of the crisis. Prosecuting crimes against the elderly would be exponentially more difficult without this resource available to law enforcement, social workers, and APS/DSHS. Name: Kay (Kyung Hwa)Jun Organization: Sound Generations, formerly Senior Services of Seattle and King County Comment: My program (l&A for Seniors and younger folks with disabilities) has been working with GRAT closely, with the capacity as an referral agency. There has been huge volume of crisis calls (daily basis) from concerned community members who does not know where to turn. GRAT is the one who was there to go out to the community and help out the senior individuals who's in crisis while no other could reach out that effectively and fast (within 3 days), I'd like to advocate for GRAT in your decision to keep funding the much needed program like GRAT. Name: Kathy Van Olst Organization: KCPAO Comment: The Geriatric Regional Assessment Team provides an incredible service to the community. ln the prosecutor's office, there are many elders in the community that are not currently in the mental health system but are experiencing crisis due to evolving cognitive impairments (as victims and offenders). GRAT is the agency where we can refer families whose elders are in crisis to have a competent mental health assessment done in order to plan next steps for these individuals. They are an incredible resource for our community. Name: Annie Jacobsen Organization: SHAG Community Life Foundation Comment: ln my 3 years with SHAG as Resident Services Manager we have found the GRAT team to be an invaluable resource and service, The caliber of the team is extraordinary in their efficient, skill and compassion. As a state with below standard services for mentally challenged individuals, they are often falling to unskilled options - housing not meant for the challenges they face as one example, lt is often 263 of 2901 8406 Appendix O humiliating for our res\u00a1dents to be a person with a mental health issue being shunned in a community where they simply want to make a home - because of behavior issues or habits. We need to do better by those with mental health challenges and it is of vital importance to have programs like GRAT and DMHP for this reason. Name: Elizabeth Strewler Organization: UW School of Social Work Comment: I write to you today as a concerned citizen and advocate for one of our area's consistently at- risk and underserved communities, our LGBTQ older adult population, Despite being an at-risk group in itself, the LGBTQ community includes many particularly high risk groups, some of whom are: LGBTQ veterans, trans* older adults, LGBTQ older adults of color, those living with HlV, those of limited ability status, those living in poverty, as well as the'oldest old'and caregivers. ln King County, LGBTQolder adults represent about 2.4% of the older adult population and are expected to double by 2030. Numerous reports and studies, severalof them conducted here at the University of Washington, confirm that the LGBTQ aging community faces considerably higher rates of mental health challenges (including suicidality), substance use, and isolation than their heterosexual counterparts. Troublingly, LGBTQ identities and behavioral health challenges continue to be highly stigmatized, even in a progressive region like King County. This continued stigmatization translates to an increased threat of victimization and discrimination for our local LGBTQ older adults, who often face a combination of challenges as they move through their daily life. We know that the LGBTQ aging community can be both resourceful and resilient when provided with the supports and resources they need, At present, our local LGBTQ older adults rely primarily on their informal peer groups and networks for support, few of which are equipped to address the mental health and substance use challenges that so often affect members of this community. This is because programming that could serve them more comprehensively does not yet exist, Several core components of MIDD's programmatic focus areas would directly address the unmet needs of this growing population. As the MIDD moves forward with plans for new prevention, intervention, and systems improvements that will address the behavioral health challenges experienced by King County constituents, I urge you to forge programming specifically tailored to the needs of our LGBTQ aging community. Thank you for your time in taking my public comment into consideration. Name: Yoon Joo Han Organization: Asian Counseling and Referral Service Comment: There is great need for mental health services for minority community members as many are not eligible for Medicaid or health benefit. We would like to see increased amount designated for Non- Medicaid funding for mental health and CD outpatient services. Workload reduction funding has been very helpful in addressing workload of our case managers who carry such a high caseload. Although it is not enough to solve the problem, certainly it has been helpful as it can be used in a creative way for each agency. We would like to see an increase in workload reduction fund and the kind of support to support the infrastructure. I would have liked a focus on cultural competency, whether it is to increase the level of culturalcompetency in the system or providers'level, or in direct service staff. lam not sure how or whether this MIDD ll took equity, socialjustice and cultural competency into consideration. 264 of 29O1 8406 Appendix O There is more need to address these important values and issues that we all share. Thank you for the important workl Comment: To whom it may concern: I am writing today to urge the MIDD Oversight Committee to recognize and continue to support the ever-growing needs of the aging LGBT community. As a community that is facing pronounced mental health and behavioral health disparities, the aging LGBT community is in dire need of preventative and supplemental services. Despite the growth of the this community, now making up about 2.4% of the older adult population in Seattle/King County, no services exist that address their unique needs. LGBT are at higher risk for poor health as mental health related issues and therefor\u00ea need specialized resources as well. Poor mental health can lead to other health related issues such as increased drug use and higher riskforsuicide. One of the themes that came up in MIDD focus groups was the stigma that is often associated with using mental health care services. This stigma is even more prominent with the LGBT community given stigma surrounding identifying as LGBT is still outstanding. Older adults face these and other hardships, such as mobility issues and economic instability, \u00a1n attempting to access services. For these reasons, it is critical that programming be dedicated to the older LGBT community in King County, I would like to commend the efforts of the Committee to include our aging community in the initial MIDD recommendations and would ask that we recall that the LGBT aging community should be specifically addressed in these efforts as well, With more efforts in behavioral health services focused in prevention and early intervention, our aging LGBT community can have a better chance of aging in a healthy and dignified manner.

An assumption has been made that \"Medicaid dollars\" (aka WlSe program funding) will enhance or supplement the current Wraparound delivery model, and therefore the overall budget for this program could be reduced without changing the service delivery. What this assumption fails to take into account is twofold: 1-. The WlSe funding model is not sustainable in itself, and does not provide adequate funding for the program design, and 2. MIDD Wraparound dollars provided key program elements which are not at allfunded in the WlSe model. One of these key elements funded through the MIDD funding is Flex Funds. Flex Funds help to fill \"gaps\" in a client's care plan, and address needs that would not be otherwise paid for through categorical services. Examples of this would be sports fees to allow a youth in CD treatment to engage in prosocial activities which the family could not pay for, or items needed to create a safe living space for a child with Autism, or camp fees for a child with profound behavior needs to engage in \"typical\" summer activities, build skills, and give parents a needed break. Flex Funds are a crucial part of the service delivery model specifically because they are flexible. The child's team can decide to use them in a way that is culturally appropriate and clinically indicated. A second key element of the MIDD Wraparound program includes \"following\" a youth who has been admitted to a CLIP facility, Under the WlSe program model, Wraparound would end when a youth enters long-term residential treatment facility. However with MIDD funding, the Wraparound team could continue to support this family and enhance the treatment and discharge planning of the youth. Our experience has found that this is crucial in ensuring that the expert clinical work done at the CLIP facilities can be effectively \"translated\" back to the child's family, school, outpatient mental health team, and natural support network. We have received feedback from more than one CLIP facility that they see more parent engagement, increased support network involvement, and an overall better prognosis for the future when Wraparound has maintained involvement throughout a youth's stay. Finally, and perhaps most \u00a1mportantly, MIDD funding allows families who do not have Medicaid to have access to the Wraparound program. ln our community we serve families across a socioeconomic spectrum, because mental health, substance abuse, and behavioral needs affect all communities. Reducing this funding would limit access for our non-Medicaid families, and eliminate their opportunity to engage in this research based, team-based planning process. There are many families in our community who do not receive Medicaid, yet have children with profound emotional or behavioral disturbances. Wraparound supports these families in navigating the complex mental health, DDA, Juvenile Justice, Children's Administration, Special Education or Substance Abuse systems. The process also supports the family in developing robust proactive crisis and care plan which reduce the need for hospital or detention stays, and allow youth to remain in appropriate school and home settings. Please consider restoring the MIDD Wrap\u00e1round budget to its original funding level. This program is unique in that it suppotts youth up to age 21-, and enhances the work of providers across a variety of child-serving systems. By appropriately funding this single program, the efficiency of several 266 of 290I 8406Appendix O others are \u00a1ncreased, and the burden on our hospitals, schools, social workers, and therapists can be distributed across a team of cross-agency supports. Thank you for your consideration. Name: Kailey Fiedler Organization: HERO House Comment: I believe the recommendations are appropriate and help focus on preventative treatment rather than reactive treatment, lt is imperative that the Clubhouse Model of Recovery that is accredited by Clubhouse lnternational is at the forefront of MIDD ll funding, The clubhouse model has proven outcomes to reduce hospitalization, cost effective in treatment and reduces individuals in jail. This is one area which the county has determined is vital to improving our mental health system. 267 of 2901 8406 Appendix P Draft MIDD ll Service lmprovement Plan Public Comment Summary: June !7 -30,20L6 A total of 65 comments on the draft MIDD ll Service lmprovement Plan were received by King County.

We appreciate that the current MIDD ll proposal would invest a significant amount of funding in permanent supportive housing and related uses. ln particular, we are grateful the proposal identifies sufficient funding to create an ongoing allocation of capital funding, compared to the one-time allocation in MIDD l. That said, we are concerned that the proposed funding leveldoes not sufficiently respond to the crisis level of homelessness our County is experiencing. At a time when the One Night Count of unsheltered homeless individuals has increase d by 2O% over one year, the proposed funding does not bring this proven best practice to scale. Unfortunately, it would create fewer permanently affordable homes over the life of M IDD ll than were created over the life of MIDD I due to increased costs and reduced external leveraging resources. We recognize MIDD ll is being shaped to respond to a variety of needs our communities are facing. However, we recommend the following actions to better address homelessness among our county's population facing mental illness and substance abuse challenges. Unallocated Funds: We strongly urge the County to prioritize permanent supportive housing capital dollars in the Service lmprovement Plan's policy regarding additional allocations, underspending, andf or recapture of funds. A similar policy is currently in place for the Veterans & Human Services Levy and serves as a best practice for promoting enhanced housing outcomes over time should additional funding opportunities become available. This serves our community well as recipients do not require ongoing funding of capital dollars. Flexibility of Housing-Related Funds: While we respect the County's need to create predictability and accountability within the Service lmprovement Plan, we encourage you to create more flexibility within the housing-related funding allocations, Services and operating dollars in particular are incredibly challenging to identify and have reached a \"cliff ,\" where the current service dollars available have already been committed to current sites, leaving a shortage of funding available to commit to new permanent supportive housing sites. Given King County's position among a variety of other funders with varying priorities, flexibility will allow you to best leverage other funding sources to create the desired outcomes. ln addition, this would align well with the unallocated funds policy recommended above, allowing the County to increase yearly funds for service dollars above 52 million if recaptured or other funds are identified to allocate toward capitalfunds. Thank you for your leadership throughout this important process. We look forward to continuing to work with you and other County leaders to advance a successful MIDD ll proposal later this year and to identify the other funding sources necessary to bring our homelessness strategies to scale.

He thanked the Oversight Committee for their work which is hugely appreciated by everyone in the community. He described permanent supportive housing, which was supported by MIDD l, as a national best practice for some of the most vulnerable people in our community, who often cannot be served without housing and cannot get housing without supportive services. He expressed the hope of the Coalition on Homelessness that some of the unallocated MIDD dollars be used to raise funding for permanent supportive housing or, given the current draft of the Service lmprovement Plan, that money from emerging issues category could be considered for use in supportive housing. His other request was for flexibility of spending: comparing housingto a three-legged stool-capital projects, operations and maintenance, and services - with varying requirements at the federal and local levels, flexibility of spending MtDD dollars would be very helpful in respect to supportive housing. 271 of2901 8406 Appendix P Name: Alicia Tillery Organization: Valley Cities Behavioral Health Comment: Alicia Tillery, VocationalSpecialist at Valley Cities Behavioral Health, thanked the MIDD Oversight Committee for their support of Supported Employment, She shared a success story about a consumer from DVR [the state Division of Vocational Rehabilitation] whom she was able to place at a CVA store where he boosted book sales by over 30 percent. Originally, this consumer had been unable to communicate, had no friends, and had never worked, at 25 years of age, But as a result of the job at CVA, his life has turned 180 degrees: his verbal communication has increased, he has friends, he is self- sufficient, his symptoms have decreased, and he is a productive citizen. This is why we are asking for an increase of 5250,000 from the present Service lmprovement Plan. We need to continue building our success numbers. Name: Sue Wyder Organization: ValleyCities Behavioral Health Comment: Sue Wyder of Valley Cities Behavioral Health thanked the MIDD Oversight Committee forthe work they have done on the budget, which she also has some experience with. Her public comment was in support of the Supported Employment Program at Valley Cities Behavioral Health, requesting the MIDD Oversight Committee recommend 5250,000 more in funding for this program. She described the spiral effect that follows decreased funding has: low performance leads to low outcomes leads to decreased services from South King County and Auburn to Northgate, the area that Valley Cities serves. A large number of consumers at Valley Cities are motivated to work because of the time that staff spends supporting them. And employment works: it establishes routines, boosts confidence, lifts people out of homelessness and addictions, and they become role models for others. These are signs of what that extra funding can do and we want everyone to have the opportunity to work. Name: Katharine Wisner Organization: HERO House Comment: Katharine Wisner, a consumer giving public comment about Hero House, described the critical importance of Hero House in helping herto live with severe anxiety and panic disorder after leaving a very stressful job last year. At Hero House, she has felt safe and accepted, No one asked questions about her mental health; they asked herto edit the newsletter and answerthe phones, so that she felt like she was contributing even while she was still experiencing symptoms, which she while working through her symptoms. Thanks to her involvement in Hero House, some therapy, and other things, she began to feel better and spoke with lsabelle at Hero House about Supported Employment. She is now working part time in something that feels meaningful to her, and she is gaining confidence; her plan is to work full time by the end of the year with the help of Supported Employment. She advocated for funding of the Supported Employment Program at the $t.ZS m\u00a1ll\u00a1on level rather than the proposed 5950,000 level. Working for her is the next step in reclaiming full recovery. 272 of 290I 8406Appendix P Name: Earl Peterson Organization: HERO House Comment: Earl Peterson, a consumer giving public comment about Hero House and the Supported Employment Program, described how Hero House has helped him greatly overthe past seven years in his recoveryfrom drug addiction, homelessness and severe depression. To live and be successful in life is lmportant and not easy for anyone. Since joining Hero House, he's been able to attend college and initiate a new charter with the Kiwanis Club to donate funds to Hero House. Other members are regularly employed and also volunteer for nonprofits. More recently, he has committed to a new workshop at the Clubhouse on life goals, sponsored by Hero House. For most in recovery, progress is slow. The improvements he has been abJe to observe in himself and others within the Clubhouse environment seem directly proportional to the growth of this organization. Helping people be all they can be is the business of this organization; lives are being changed for the better, to be more constructive, clear, with a purpose. My hope is to convey how important funding dollars are to this program. Name: Greg Davis Organization: HERO House Comment: Hi my name is Greg Davis i am a peer support Generalist at HERO House, HERO House is a safe place for people who have special needs we give hope to our members,we offer opportunities for people with special needs to rejoin their communitys. Name: Matt Valdespino Organization: HERO House Comment: Hi, my name is Matt Valdespino and I'm a staff member at HERO House here in Bellevue. I have been working at the Clubhouse for a little over a year and it has been a truly incredibly experience. The work we do helps transform lives every day, and as we have expanded our services over the past year new people from all over the county are being rehabilitated through the unique recovery-through- work modelthat is unparalleled in Western Washingotn. lt is forthat reason that I urge you to, at the very least, maintain funding for HERO House at the current levelthrough MIDD ll, if not expand it. We are a proven, cost-effective method of psychosocialrehabilitation that helps individuals return to the workforce and re-engage with the community at large: a year of services from HERO House costs roughly the same as a 2 week stay at a psychiatric hospital. lf the funding is cut, we will be forced to ration our services to the point where we will have to turn away individuals seeking assistance. This will not only damage that individual's recovery but damage the relationship of trust the members have in our program that if they want to get back to work, we will do everything to get them back to work. lt is this trust, based on the strong individual relationships built through member-staff participation in the work ordered day, that distinguishes us from any other program in the area. When members come into the Clubhouse, they know they are dealing with people who will treat them as individuals and work to support them based on their goals, their personalities, and their strengths. Our diverse staff is representative of the community at large, with eight languages between ourstaff members and even more from our active members. By supporting HERO House, the county is supporting a holistic approach 273 of 2901 8406 Appendix P to recoverythat engages the strengths of individuals with mental illnesses ratherthan fixating on their weaknesses. I urge you, on the behalf of adults living with mental illness throughout King County who have not given up on reaching their full potential, to keep supporting our wonderful program. Name: Olga Yarmoshik Organization: HERO House Comment: I am so thankful for MIDD funding as it vitally helped our program - HERO House to survive and prosper. My hope is that everyone could see the importance of continuing to fund this unique program at current level the least. Our clubhouse is currently the only clubhouse in King County that is accredited by Clubhouse lnternational and it also includes the IPS Supported Employment Program. HERO House provides a nonclinical approach to recovery from mental illness. Members have opportunity to be active part to reach their goals, whether it is employment education, skills, meaningful life, connection to others and most importantly increased self esteem and confidence. Members and staff run the program side by side, resulting in many of the members returning to work, being less isolated and finding meaning in life. Overthe past L0 years I have witnessed dozens of members going to work for the first time in very long time or even in their lifetime. These members are being able to be successful because of the many layers of support provided by HERO House program - prevocational building of skills and confidence, support from peers, encouragement from staff and opportunities to participate in socialactivities in safe and familiar environment, For members that are not interested in employment there is everyday support dealing with personal advocacy, community resources, and opportunity to participate in meaningful work of running the clubhouse. Clubhouse is effective and cost efficient option for those recovering from mental illness, Please do continue to fund our agency.

This idea would also help discharge planners from hospitals access a supportive transitional living environment for clients who need more services in orderto become stabilized. San Diego has (or used to have) an excellent rnodelforthis.

Most are unable to access free or low cost mental health services and are struggling to maintain households, relationships, and get safe and secure placements when they are in a crisis. I also talk frequently with caregivers of client's with mental health needs and the caregivers are overwhelmed with navigating mental health systems; especially involuntary commitment. More wrap around services, care coordination, and crisis diversion servlces (like GRAT) are needed for older adults and younger disabled client's. I see firsthand that many clients could be assisted if there was more funding, more intensive supports, and more creative housing environments, The alternative being costly hospitalizations where no specialized treatment is being received, becoming homeless, or living in unsafe living environments frequently calling 9L1 and going in and out of the hospital wlth no follow up or care plans. I have several client's that are not in a mental health crisis, but have undiagnosed mental health conditions and need care coordination including home visits, and assistance to get connected to a doctor. I have researched current options but so far can't find the assistance they need to live safely in the community. Washington State is one of the best places to live. lt needs to be one of the best places to live to access mental health services also. There are so many great ideas for the MIDD funding....all of them should be fu nded. Name: Debbie Fuller Organization: Mom Comment: This specific funding needs to be addressed for its Unique ability to address very Basic and REAL needs. You can have Housing,Food, Education, etc. needs met but if a Mom needs her hair cut to feel REAL to herself or a front door needs repair so a family entering doesn't have to be reminded that their Dad slammed their Mom's head into that space....THlS is the Funding that is not OUT THERE....THIS is the funding that precedes ALL the other interventions. ....this is the funding that is the platform for CHANGE......lasting/fundamental /genuine Change ! Please HEAR THIS I Name: Tina Budell Organization: None Comment: I have read through the draft and am still thinking there is more focus on overhead and oversight than getting more treatment centers open. I have a friend who's brother is struggling with addiction and can't get into treatment. He is waiting to hopefully get in at Yakima, he is from federal way and has been a homeless addict in and around Seattle to Tacoma. He has been in the methadone program to no success and keeps slipping backto heroin due to ease of access. The clinics don't always work for people who are working and need access quickly, the waiting months to get in a treatment center if you are low income is counter productive to offering poor and lower income people with REAL options for getting help and getting treatment for their addictions. As a person who's own older brother struggled with addiction for over 20 years of his life and became homeless and addicted I know first hand the struggle for addicts who are ready to get help. The waiting game only makes it easier to go 279 of 2gO1 8406Appendix P back to the drugs and lifestyle that they desperately want to leave behind. The idea that allthis reporting is going to make the addiction problem in our county/state/country go away is foolish and a waste of tax dollars. We need more treatment centers, we need intake centers that can take an addict in when they are ready and get this on the road to recovery that day, not 6 weeks later, Watching your loved one spiral into a drugged out zombie is heart breaking and destroys families, not just the addict. While my brother was trying to get into treatment was relapsed and stole jewelry from my mother who was in the hospital fighting for her life in her struggle with cancer. Had my brother been able to get in treatment when he realized he was ready and tired of being a drain on the family, he might not have been homeless for 7 years and addicted for over 20 years. Your plan needs to think about not just the future, it needs to have a concrete plan for NOW. How do we get these folks into treatment NOW, not 6 weeks from now and in a different part of the state. Name: GailStone Organization: KingCounty Comment: Thank you for the herculean effort. lt is clearly the result of a sustained, deep fact-finding and challenging moraldiscussions. Please accept my comment on one item in particular. MIDD ll Number: CD-'J\"4,lTATriage: Toolongagotoadmitinpublic,agroupof CJactors,DCHs,stateandlocal hospitals came together to address the escalating, intractable problem of people waiting in jail unconstitutionally long periods of time for an evaluation bed to open up at Western State Hospital. While this is clearly the State's obligation, it wasn't happening and wasn't going to be happening in the foreseeable future. The group developed the triage model in CD-1\"4. Harborview Medical Center generously stepped into the gap and committed staff to do jail-based evaluations, cutting the wait time significantly and, unexpectedly, resulting in better outcomes for people needing evaluation. The rest of the group committed to find ways to fund this service, which Harborview continued to provide untilthey simply couldn't sustain within current capacity. Our workgroup hasn't found any other funding source. This program works, Harborview has the expertise and the geographic proximity to make it successful. On behalf of our workgroup, thank you for including the ITA Triage project in the MIDD il SlP, and please keep it in as you wrestle with the difficult choices before you.

Mccarthy Organization: Retired King County Superior Court judge Comment: The single most important thing MIDD can do is to lobby strongly for many more residential mentalhealth facilities, both inpatient and outpatient, in King County. We have all heard foryears that both the King County jail and the juvenile detention facility are the de facto residences for the mentally ill. lndeed, the King County jail houses more mentally ill people than any facility other than Western State Hospital. Unless and until the Legislature commits to many more community mental health facilities, the mentally illwillcontinue to be incarcerated in our jails. That intolerable situation must end before any meaningful treatment and counseling can begin . We have been lobbying for this for many years with no change. Frankly, it leaves us who have been fighting for changes in the care for the mentally ill somewhat doubtful that the legislature will make the necessary commitment, particularly in light of their long standing failure to fund public education, their first duty.

Name: Laura Collins Organization: None Comment: Re: MIDD lnitiative CD-14: lnvoluntary Treatment Triage project which serves mentally ill individuals who have committed a serious misdemeanor and are found not competent to assist in their defense. This project provides a safer, more efficient and local evaluation process forthese individuals, and has demonstrated great impact in multiple spheres - including diversion from costly ER visits and State hospital admissions, improved utilization of local resources and ensures compliance with the requirements of the civil commitment evaluation process outlined in RCW L0.77. This project has brought the required evaluation process back in-line with the Statute, which requires that these persons be evaluated for possible long term civil commitment (90 day inpatient treatment) vs. a shorter 72 hour comm\u00a1tment, lf funded, this program will hire the providers that are qualified to file and testify for the possible 90 day commitment as required by law. Without this project, these individuals will continue to be evaluated for the 72 hour commitment only. Prior to Decembe r 2O!3, these individuals were either referred to Western State Hospital or Harborview's Emergency Department for these evaluations. Both processes were costly, risking longer lengths of stay (at Western State) and safety of patients and staff by treating these persons in an unpredictable emergency department environment of highly vulnerable patients. This project would bypass transfers to Western State or the Emergency Depaftment, by allowing the evaluation to take place in the jail - a more safe and cost effective process. The other strong benefit of this project is its promotion of localcare - both inpatient and outpatient. This project includes in the evaluation a thorough coordination with both ex\u00edsting and new outpatient providers, and encourages the development of a safe outpatient alternative plan that can prevent unnecessary hospitalizations. One discovery Harborview made when piloting this process, was that a majority of these individuals were already connected with care, and with some extra leg-work, the evaluators were 282 of 290I 8406 Appendix P able to ensure that connection was in place in creating an outpatient plan. For the individuals who were believed to require inpatient levelof care, this process ensured the admission to a local psychiatric facility (rather than the State hospital), in turn promoting shorter lengths of stay by keeping these persons in their own community. Moreover with this local process This supports fewer State Hospital admissions. ln the original pilot of this project, it was found that a very small percentage (10%) of these individuals were actually ultimately placed on the long term (90 day) commitment and only 4% ultimately transferred to Western State Hospital. Please support the funding of the lnvoluntary Treatment Triage Project! Thank you, Laura Collins Namer Jennifer Phillips Organ\u00a1zat\u00a1on: None Comment: lt appears that some of the new initiatives proposed may address what we've experienced as parents of a teen with mental illness. But I didn't find the details explained in the report or missed if there were fuller descriptions. As part of preventing ED visits/hospitalizations, our personal experience is that much clearer and quickly responsive gap services are needed. She has a behavioral health team but we've repeatedly been in a situation where we see several warning signs that mean a gLL call or journey to the ED is imminent and yet the ability to get a very rapid intervention to try preventing this is non-existent. There's no where else we can take her in these situations. And we've also been left without intensive outpatient services upon her discharge, basically teetering on the edge of crisis during fragile weeks after hospitalization. I'm not sure if a behavioral health urgent care center would be a twist on an ED but will be curious to learn more. lnformation about what is available in services and how to match to needs also feels fractured. Hope this is part of the next wave of improvements, so professionals can more easily advise patients/families on options. Also couldn't tellfrom the report whether those with developmental and intellectual disabilities and/or parents and guardians were consulted as part of this process. Hoping yes. This also is a dimension to our situation and it creates complicated situations in receiving services. Thanks.

Name: Christopher S Organization: HEROHouse Comment: I think HERO House benefits me in terms of being more social, accepting my mental illness, and helping me find a job, employment-wise. I've been out of work for three years, and I imagined one day I would go back to work, HERO House is an integral part of making that happen. I'm developing job skills with my activities at HERO House. I've spoken at a few NAMI meetings and other community type organizations as a HERO House representative. These opportunities have helped me regain confidence in myself.

Brown Organization: HEROHouse Comment: I graduated not knowing that there was a resource in mental health as personal and community oriented as HERO House. The work that clubhouse does is unprecedented in making people with mental illnesses feel wanted, needed, and included, which is something that society is not good at. l've seen mental illness in my family a lot and I only wish that I had known about organizations like HERO House as a resource for everyone I know with mental illness. Every resource here is used sparingly and wisely. There is no waste here. We'd love to stick around longer and be able to grow to be a front runner in mental health in King County. I work as a Program Generalist at HERO House and as such I am intimately involved in the workings of the everyday clubhouse. The King County/MIDD ll current funding level of HERO House at 5362,489 per year is essential to our running smoothly and not a cent is wasted, Here are a few of the ways I believe that we merit such funding, 1. HERO House is a unique organization in King County because it is the only clubhouse that is accredited by Clubhouse lnternational and it also includes the IPS Supported Employment Program. HERO House provides a nonclinical approachto recoverywhich puts people backtoworkand keeps them there. We increase access to community services through our clubhouse supports such as bus passes, the SE program, and our education program. 2. At HERO House, our staff represents the community we serve at large. Our staff provides support in more than eight languages. This creates a diverse culture and is reflected in our continued growth for members and staff. 3. One year of recovery at HERO House costs the same as a 2 week psychiatric hospital stay: Clubhouse is cost effective. 4. Forty-two percent employment rates are achieved at Accredited Clubhouses, like HERO House which is double the average employment rate for people in the public mental health system. Although I am in wise a SE specialist I do know that there are a few of the specifics that we are seeking in regards to funding of Supported Employment at S1,250,000. t. lf funded at 950K this would be a decrease by 21-0K compared to the previous year's funding level, lf funding at the 950k level currently proposed, this successful employment program would need to reduce enrollments and turn people away who are seeking jobs as part of their recovery journeys. 2. Performance/Cuts:This program routinely outperforms performance benchmarks for job placem\u00eants and job retention expectations. ln a performance based payment program, when we'cut performance based payments, we decrease performance, With this funding, we are likely to employ and retain less people at work. ln total we've received 51-,375 in cuts per employed person for the same job placements and job retentions because we are achieving them in greater numbers today, We cannot continue to provide the same level of services or expand this high performing program with less funding. 285 of 29O1 8406Appendix P Name: Elizabeth Archambault Organization: The DoVE Project Comment: My comment is more general. At DoVE, our mission is domestic violence. Many of our clients need therapists to be sure and many cannot afford private therapists and cannot, for many reasons, go to VYFS (past trauma, their abuser goes there, abuser's \"people\" are there). This is very limiting. Last year after the most recent youth suicide, I had community members coming up to me saying that their teens were sitting around tables with their friends saying \"What if it's me next?\" lt was like there was no control over suicide and that was horrifying to parents, So. Two things happened. We started sending teens (as prevention)and adults (as intervention)to Axiom Equine Assisted Education (not exactly therapy -- and with great results). We have sent approximately 30 folks through and we get requests for this weekly even though the money for this program is gone. Also, because of the bleak situation on the island, a family foundation approached us in December and gave us S1-5000 to develop and implement a plan where we pay for islanders to attend therapy with a therapist (private) of their choice. This also covered substance abuse counselling. This program was crazy popularand half waythrough theyear, the money is gone and we have more people asking us for it, My point here is that on Vashon different methods can work. We must be innovative because there is no other choice. I hope that MIDD can allow room for innovative projects that help the overall health of the community in the ways that they need and want.

One, Wraparound serves are being considered for a cut, which will affect those youth in King County who are in Crisis. By cutting the MIDD wraparound, the flex funds that are vitally important to this EBP will not cover the MIDD Wraparound families needs and WlSe does not include these funds at all. Two, the Nofth end of the county is being overlooked for many of the SIP services especially the services for children and youth. The Nofth part of the county also has needs and it would be a huge blow to our community to be excluded. Name: Guy Andrews Organization: None Comment: 1-.

Name: Kaz Uchimura Organization: HERO House Comment: I am an Employment Generalist at HERO House (Non profit organization working with people who got mental health challenges) and follow IPS (lndividual Placement and Support) model for our members' job placements. We also follow the fidelity scales supported by King County, Mental Health, Chemical Abuse and Dependency Services Division. Now I would like to share my opinions about the draft MIDD ll Service lmprovement plan. 1. lf funded at 950K this would be a decrease by 210K compared to the previous year's funding level. lf funding at the 950k level currently proposed, this successful employment program would need to reduce enrollments and turn people away who are seeking jobs as part of their recovery journeys. 2.

We cannot continue to provide the same level of services or expand this high performing program with less funding, I truly believe that Supported Employment program works well with individuals who have mental health challenges not only they start earning money, but also they find their desired goal in employment. I placed 7 members at work since last November and would like to work with more individuals who are willing to get back to work and we will appreciate your support. Thank you. Name: Beratta Gomillion Organization: Center for Human Services Comment: There is a major flaw in the thinking behind reducing Wraparound funds. WlSe program funds will not adequately fund the deficit created by the reduction proposed. This must be reconsidered immediately. Thank you. 288 of 29018406Appendix P Name: Ashley Fontaine Organization: NAMI Seattle Comment: I fully support the addition of seats to the MIDD Oversight Committee, especially those which ensure the voices of traditionally underrepresented groups are heard. Behavioral Health Workforce Shortage, Behavioral Health on Demand, Behavioral Health Urgent Care Walk in Clinic - We have to find a way to address our workforce shortage in King County. While the behavioral health walk in clinic does not directly address this issue, it has the potential to mitigate a huge barrier to treatment: waiting. When someone is seeking help and ready to walk through that door, we have to have a mechanism to keep that door open. A walk in clinic is a vital middle-of-the-road entry point and will support our commitment to recovery by helping create a \"no wrong door\" approach to care. Community Driven Grants - I am extremely happy to see that creating community-driven grants so geographic and culturally diverse communities can customize behavioral health services fortheir unique needs is a listed priority for MIDD ll. Clubhouse - the Clubhouse model needs ongoing support from MIDD and should not have funding reduced. Currently, Hero House is the only place in King County accredited by Clubhouse lnternational, and acts as a model for other Clubhouses in the county. We desperately need a clubhouse on the west side of the county, to provide employment training and support, social engagement and friendship, and a sense of purpose for people working the path to recovery. We know that employment is a crucial component of recovery for so many people, and we know that social isolation can contribute significantly to negative mental health outcomes. Clubhouses provide much needed services outside the clinical/medical model - we need more this type of community based care, and we need to ensure that Clubhouses are not subjected to the changing whims of Medicaid funding. First Episode psychosis Programs - Multiple research studies from around the world show that the longer psychosis goes untreated, the more serious it becomes. Otherstates, including our neighbor Oregon, have implemented FEP programs with great success. While Washington has its first FEP program pilot underway in Yakima, we need FEP here in the most densely populated county in ourstate. I interact with countless families whose lives have been turned upside down by psychosis in their teens and young adults, who are frustrated that this type of programming isn't available to them. This is a prime opportunity to pair MIDD funds and Best Starts for Kids funds to create a robust FEP program, Early interventions like FEP programs are a game changerthat can dramatically improvethetrajectoryfor young people experiencing psychosis. Organization: HEROHouse Comment: On SEP: The ASK: We are asking that funding of SE be at Si.,250,000 which is 250k above previous MIDD 1- level. 1-' lf funded at the only 950K, this would be a decrease by 21OK compared to the previous year's funding level. lf only funded at 950K, our SEP employment program would need to reduce enrollments and turn people away who are seeking jobs as part of their recovery journeys. iobs are criticalfor our members to feel like they are back in the community; it increases their self esteem and lowers society's costs for supporting them. 2. Performance/Cuts: This program routinely outperforms performance benchmarks for job placements and job retention expectations. ln a performance-based payment program, when we cut 289 of 2901 8406 Appendix P performance-based payments, we decrease performance.
