Although yoga is great for exercise, the original purpose of yoga is to help one achieve liberation through stillness of the mind which is realized as one physically practices yoga. A healthy mind makes for a healthy body and overall healthy lifestyle which includes healthy relationships, healthy eating habits, healthy perception and healthy decision making. Refine your mental processes, clean out physical and mental toxins and blockages through the practice of authentic Yoga. I have been a consistent student of Yoga for 3 years and received my license to teach in a vigorous program located in Bali under a well advanced Guru. I have a medical background as a nurse x 8 years and my experience during those years ranged from drug and alcohol detox nurse, in home care for children with developmental disabilities, experience in the correctional system, and hospice. I am an Ayurvedic Wellness Practitioner and I incorporate Ayurvedic counseling in my sessions upon request. Ayurveda is an ancient eastern life science containing much wisdom in regards to the human being in relation to Nature. In practicing Ayurveda, I help people achieve optimal health physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually with focus on life preservation, disease prevention and spiritual advancement by way of herbs, diet, and lifestyle counseling according to Ayurvedic principles. I am an Air Force veteran and have helped many vets manage conditions such as anxiety, depression and PTSD using these practices, as well as myself. I provide Yoga, meditation and Ayurvedic counseling services that are tailored to an individuals specific needs based on their innate elemental makeup, and this is what makes my service unique. We all have different needs, restrictions, strengths, and goals, therefore no one practice will benefit all. We all respond differently- energetically, mentally, physically and emotionally to our environment. What makes Yoga self transformative? Yoga serves as an awareness facilitator by encouraging self reflection within each asana (pose), breath, sensation, the moments in between and each thought that occurs throughout the process. Each thought and feeling reveals the nature of the mind, consciousness and spirit offering insight into the false perceptions of the mind. This is where self discovery and awareness begins. You then can begin practicing mastering asanas by monitoring the mental processes and becoming undisturbed by the fluctuations of the mind, remaining stable in the midst of challenge and change. This is Self Mastery. What I enjoy most about practicing and sharing Yoga are the benefits seen throughout one's life, on the mat and off. There is nothing more rewarding than seeing the relief on my students faces after a great yoga and meditation session. It's as if you can see and feel the heaviness of whatever was carried lift off of them, and I am always so honored and grateful that I am able to assist with that. "}
