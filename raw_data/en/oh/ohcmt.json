Abstract An alarming increase in emergence of antibiotic resistance among pathogens worldwide has become a serious threat to our ability to treat infectious diseases according to the World Health Organization. Extensive use of antibiotics by livestock producers promotes the spread of new resistant strains, some of zoonotic concern, which increases food-borne illness in humans and causes significant economic burden on healthcare systems. Furthermore, consumer preferences for meat/poultry/fish produced without the use of antibiotics shape today 's market demand. So, it is viewed as inevitable by the One Health Initiative that humans need to reduce the use of antibiotics and turn to alternative, improved means to control disease: vaccination and prophylactics. Besides the intense research focused on novel therapeutic molecules, both these strategies rely heavily on the availability of cost-effective, efficient and scalable production platforms which will allow large-volume manufactu ring for vaccines, antibodies an d other biopharmaceuticals. Within this context, plant-based platforms for production of recombinant therapeuti c proteins offer significant advantages over conventional expression systems, including lack of a nimal pathogens, low production costs, fast turnaround and response times and rapid, nearly-unlimited scalability. Also, because dried leaves and seeds can be stored at room temperature for lengthy periods without loss of recombi nant proteins, plant expression systems have the potential to offer lucrative benefits from the development of edible vaccines and prophylactics, as these would not require \"cold chain \"storage and transportation, and could be administered in mass volumes with minimal processing. Several biotechnology companies currently have developed and adopted plant-based platforms for commercial production of recombinant protein therapeutics. In this manuscript, we outline the challenges in the process of livestock immunization as well as the current plant biotechnology developments aimed to address these challenges. Table of contents 1.

References 1. Introduction The health and well-being of food-bearing animals is amajor preoccupation for any livestock, poultry or fish pro- ducer. Endemic disease or epidemic outbreaks represent a very significant financial risk to the producer due to lossof animals, production of animals that are not marketable, and reduction in feed conversion efficiency. The potential risk to consumers from contaminated food is an import-ant public health concern, and very significant investments are made by the agri-food industry to ensure safe food products. Nevertheless, an estimated 9.4 million cases ofillness due to consumption of food contaminated with known pathogens occurs annually in the United States [1]. Thus, it is critically important that primary producers en-sure the health of their livestock for public health, animal welfare and business profitability reasons. The key to minimizing animal morbidity and mortality is the employment of good production practices. Best practices will vary according to the production system, but land-based agriculture will typically include provisionof uncontaminated feed and water, adequate ventilation and air quality, biosecurity, robust surveillance of animal health, and the judicious use of antimicrobial agents andparasiticides for disease prevention and treatment, when warranted. Prominent in the animal health toolbox are antibiotics. It can be reasonable to assume that the avail-ability of antibiotics will become increasingly constrained as legitimate public alarm over the looming spectre of catastrophic antibiotic resistance in human medicine istranslated into action at the farm level. Furthermore, the development of antibiotic resistance will progressively re- duce antibiotic therapy options available to veterinarians.More restricted use of veterinary antibiotics will result from market-driven forces, as consumers increasingly demand antibiotic-free food, and through the policies ofgovernments and codes of practice of veterinary practi- tioners that promote judicious use [2]. Within this evolving environment, newly developed vaccines andimmunotherapeutic agents offer the potential to lessen the need for antibiotics for disease control, and offer veterinary practitioners much needed tools [3]. The global market for animal vaccines is estimated to be currently worth $5.8 billion, and is anticipated to grow with a compound annual growth rate of 8.1% to a value of$8.6 billion by 2018 [4]. The efficacy of a vaccine, the ease with which it can be employed, and the overall benefit in terms of increased productivity must be competitivewith other disease management options. Recent advances in immunology and in biotechnology, specifically the development of methods to produce potent vaccines verycost-effectively using plant-based bioreactors have the po- tential to make vaccines an even more attractive propos- ition. Furthermore, in cases where vaccination cannot beused to prevent disease, the production of antibodies in plants for passive immunotherapy and infectious disease control holds great promise. This review paper will cover animal immunization es- sentials and will present the latest developments in plant biotechnology for the production of veterinary therapeu-tics. Specific aspects discussed will include high-level re- combinant protein production in plant-based systems, the ability to use unpurified material for treatment, thepossibility of oral rather than parenteral delivery, low cost of protein/vaccine production, very short turnaround time from conception to large-scale manufacturing, and theability to \"stack \"genes encoding antigens and adjuvants to create potent multi-target vaccines in a single preparation. 2. Immunization of livestock animals 2.1 Active/passive immunization In contrast to humans, newborn farm animals (foals, piglets, calves, lambs, kids) depend totally, and companion animals (kittens, puppies) almost completely upon uptake of colostral antibodies for their systemic maternal immunityagainst pathogens [5]. neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and is highest immediately after birth and declines rapidly within24 h as intestinal cells mature and intestinal flora are estab- lished. The time of cessation of this macromolecular trans- port (gut closure) varies by species and immunoglobulintype, ranging between 20 to 36 h of age [6]. For multipar- ous animal species, the degree of passive immunity can be heterogeneous between litters and among members of asame litter because of variability in colostral absorption. This is true for piglets, puppies and kittens, whose levels of passive antibodies are maximum 36-48 h after birth. Fromthis time on, the immunoglobulin concentrations decline in the serum of the newborn animal. The half-life depends on immunoglobulin isotype, and on the species, varying be-tween 1 to 4 days for IgA and IgM, to approximately 8 to 22 days for canine and equine IgG, respectively [7]. The af- finity of IgG for most likely accounts forthese differences observed serum half-life among species and different IgG subclasses [7,8]. Also, the growth rate of the animal influences the rate of decline in the level of thematernally-derived antibodies. This is particularly clear in canine species, where dogs belonging to rapid growth breeds eliminate their maternally-derived antibodies morequickly than slow-growth breeds. In addition to differences in uptake of maternal antibodies, the degree of passive im- munity is not equal for all tissu es. For instance, colostralKolotilin et al. Veterinary Research 2014, 45:117 Page 2 of 12 http://www.veterinaryresearch.org/content/45/1/117immunity protects young anima ls against systemic infection during the first months of life, whereas the respiratory tract m u c u si sp r o t e c t e do n l yf o raf e ww e e k s[ 9 ] . Shortly after parturition, drastic changes occur in the composition of colostrum with a drastic drop in IgG and IgA. In most domestic animals, the drop in IgA is lesspronounced than IgG, so that IgA becomes the most im- portant immunoglobulin in milk [10]. Milk antibodies are essential to protect young animals against intestinal infec-tions. The IgA in the milk is dimeric secretory IgA (SIgA). The dimeric IgA is secreted in the mammary gland tissue by plasma cells, binds with its J chain to the polymeric im-munoglobulin receptor (pIgR) e xpressed at the basolateral site of the alveolar epithelial cells and is endocytosed, trans- cytosed and exocytosed to the interstitial space after cleav-age of the receptor. The extracellular 80 kDa part of pIgR is exceptionally carbohydrate-rich, and when incorporated into the Ig molecules as bound secretory component (SC),it endows IgG concentrations remain higher than IgA, and IgG1 is specifically enriched in colostrumand milk, with levels approximately 10 times higher than I g Ao rI g G 2 .T h er o l eo fF c R ni nt h i st r a n s p o r th a sn o t been completely clarified [7,8]. 2.2 Induction of protective immunity At weaning, lactogenic protection disappears, makingthe young animals highly susceptible to infections with enteropathogens. Most pathogens either colonize the mu- cosa or invade the host at a mucosal surface. Optimal pro-tection against these pathogens most often involves the induction of pathogen-specific SIgA at the infection site [12]. As such, an optimal vaccine should induce robustmucosal SIgA immune responses. Parenteral vaccines typically induce IgG, a response that is not particularly effective aga inst these types of infections. The best way to elicit pathogen -specific SIgA is to activate the local mucosa-associated l ymphoid tissue (MALT) at the site of colonization or invasion through mucosal vaccin-ation. This necessity to administer vaccines at the mucosal site relating to the pathogen 's tropism is further highlighted by the compartmentalization of the mucosal immune sys-tem. For example, stimulation of gut-associated lymphoid t i s s u e( G A L T )d o e sn o ti n d u c eap r o t e c t i v eS I g Ar e s p o n s e in the respiratory tract, whi le induction of an immune re- sponse at the nasal mucosa fails to induce intestinal protec- tion [11,13]. Taking this int o account, the induction of mucosal immunity further requires the vaccine to pass sev-eral physiological barriers and defence mechanisms. To reach the inductive sites of t he mucosal immune system, whether it is upon oral, intranasal, rectal or urogenital ad-ministration, the vaccine has to surmount mucus and anti- microbial peptides and traverse the epithelial barrier. In case of oral administration, the vaccine also needs tosurvive the low pH in the stomach, digestive enzymes and bile salts and be transported via peristalsis to the GALT. Furthermore, the vaccine has to trigger protective mucosalimmunity instead of tolerance, which is the dominant re- sponse mode of the mucosal immune system, and this without causing severe inflammation [13]. Fusing vaccineantigens to antibody or antibody fragment to target the subunit vaccine to antigen-sampling routes at the mucosal surfaces, such as transcytotic epithelial receptors, coulddrastically improve oral vaccine efficacy [14]. Only a limited number of mucosal vaccines have been shown to meet these criteria a nd, consequently, only a few have been internationally licensed. Of those that have been licensed, most are based on live-attenuated pathogens and a few are inactivated pathogens [15]. No mucosal subunit vac-cines have been licensed sys- tems, such as virus-like parti cles (VLPs, see text) or other p a r t i c l e sh a v eb e e ns h o w nt ob ei m m u n o g e n i ci nm i c ev i athe oral route, almost none of t hese were successful in larger animals or humans [3]. This c ould be explained by the lon- ger intestinal transit time for these particles to reach the in-ductive sites in larger mammalian species in contrast with mice. As a result, in larger animals, only a small portion of the particles will reach the GALT, resulting in fewer particlesbeing taken up by M cells and subsequently no or low in- duction of intestinal mucosal immune responses. In contrast to particulate systems, soluble antigens are not immunogenic and in general induce tolerance upon mucosal administration even in mice. However, a few soluble antigens have been shown to be immunogenic viathe as cholera and their [16], and the purified F4 fimbriae of enterotoxigenicE. coli in pigs [17]. These antigens are characterized by the ability to bind to receptors on enterocytes in the small intestine and to be taken up by these epithelial cells[18], followed by induction of an antigen-specific IgA response. Whereas microgram quantities of CTB and LTB are immunogenic, F4 has to be given in milligramamounts [17]. The oral route has the advantage over other routes in that the vaccine antigens can be adminis- tered in the feed, eliminating the need to restrain livestock during administration and allowing the use of less-purified antigens. 2.3 Modes of vaccination 2.3.1 Subcutaneous and intramuscular The delivery of veterinary vaccines, in general, is by in- jection although there are variations depending upon the animal species being immunized, management practices and age of the animal. For example, virtually all vaccinesfor cattle are delivered parenterally, while those for use in poultry are delivered by injection, orally, or by aero- sol. Ultimately, the route of delivery is dictated largelyKolotilin et al. Veterinary Research 2014, 45:117 Page 3 of 12 http://www.veterinaryresearch.org/content/45/1/117by the various management systems employed, as well as the ease of handling of individual animals. There are a number of issues associated with invasive vaccine delivery in food-producing animals, one of which is the economic loss associated with trimming of area sur- rounding injection site lesions. Many veterinary vaccinesare extremely pro-inflammatory in nature, an example be- ing Clostridial vaccines used in cattle. When delivered subcutaneously, these vaccines tend to result in a largeswelling which can persist for months. On the other hand, intramuscular injection does not result in overt swelling but causes significant tissue damage near the injection site.The cost associated with carcass trimming has been esti- mated to be between $1.46 and $40.00 per animal [19]. In addition, it is not uncommon for needles to break duringintramuscular delivery, causing problems at processing, as well as the retail level. While injection of the antigens themselves can result in tissue damage, most killed vac-cines also contain strong adjuvants which contribute to this damage. Adjuvants significantly increase the cost of the vaccines and also dictate both the quality and magni-tude of the immune response, the former of which has been biased towards Th2 immune responses. Adjuvants currently in use are suitable for injection, but most are notcompatible with mucosal delivery [20]. To maintain their efficacy, most injectable vaccines require proper refriger- ation and storage, a need that can be challenging in exten-sive livestock operations especially in developing nations. 2.3.2 Intranasal The delivery of modified live viral vaccines via the intra- nasal route or in drinking water has been effective. How- ever, live bacterial vaccines are not commonly used, inpart due to the use of antibiotics in the industry. Muco- sal vaccines are available for swine, including those for Bordetella bronchiseptica , where they have been shown to result in enhanced SIgA production following a single administration by the intranasal route [21]. A novel adju- vant platform consisting of and cationic innate defense regulator peptide (IDR) 1002, has also been tested for efficacy in a swine model and shown to provide a long duration of immunity againstBordetella pertussis in mice following a single intranasal administration [22]. Interestingly, this formulation also works in the presence of maternal antibodies [23], makingit ideal for mucosal immunization of neonates. All presently available commercial vaccines targeting the respiratory tract via intranasal, aerosol or conjunctivalapplication are live attenuated or vector vaccines [24]. Nevertheless, there is the potential for using protein vac- cines consisting of dead microorganisms or subunits (viru-lence factors). Immunization of the respiratory tract has been experimentally demonstr ated by i) using particulate delivery systems, which are either lipophilic, mucoadhesiveand/or contain immunomodulating molecules, ii) using sol- uble epitopes) tar- geting the antigens to the muco sa of the respiratory tract or iii) using soluble antigens. Often, adjuvants are needed for strong mucosal immune responses [25]. Whereas experi- mental results have been pro mising in many studies, no dead vaccines for immunizati on of the respiratory tract have been commercialized, as adverse reactions have ham- pered their development. Indeed, anaphylaxis due to im-purities, or Bell 's palsy due to vaccine components have been described [26]. Results from animal studies suggest that the intranasal route may itself facilitate transport ofproteins, inactivated vaccines, live viruses or other particles into the central nervous system [27]. Therefore, candidate vaccines targeting the respiratory tract mucosa have to bethoroughly evaluated for adverse effects. 2.3.3 Oral Oral vaccination, or so called \"edible vaccines \",h a v eb e e n traditionally viewed as the panacea of plant-produced vaccines in terms of their use as an approach to diseasecontrol [28]. Edible vaccines offer several advantages over conventional methods of vaccine delivery. Edible vaccines come in contact with the lining of the digestive tract, thusgiving them the potential to stimulate both mucosal and systemic immunity, the former of which is a response that is notoriously difficult to achieve through injections, whichbypass mucosal barriers. In part, this accounts for the rea- son as to why the efficacy of injectable vaccines against in- testinal pathogens has generally been quite poor. Edible vaccines also have positive implications for live- stock welfare, as they could be administered directly in the diet, eliminating the need to confine the animal, orthe need to breach the skin through injection, a practice that can promote secondary infections. Oral administra- tion of vaccines eliminates the risks that injection-basedmethods pose on meat quality as a result of intramuscu- lar administration. 3. Plant-based bioreactors Being eukaryotic organisms, plants can express, synthesize and process complex heterologous proteins similarly to\"conventional \", fermentation-based expression systems, such as mammalian, insect and yeast cell cultures. Yet, plants have some variances in the pattern of protein gly-cosylation [29]. Production of recombinant therapeutic proteins has been demonstrated in a variety of plant species. Plant cells contain genomes of three types: nu-clear, chloroplast (plastome) and mitochondrial genomes. Generation of stable transgenic plants that produce re- combinant proteins can be efficiently achieved throughgenetic engineering of the nuclear genome or the plas- tome. In addition, transient expression methods allow quick and robust production of recombinant proteins byKolotilin et al. Veterinary Research 2014, 45:117 Page 4 of 12 http://www.veterinaryresearch.org/content/45/1/117way of infiltration of plant leaf tissue with transgene- harboring agrobacteria [30]. Recombinant proteins produced in nuclear-transformed plants are synthesized in the cytoplasm and can be se- creted, or accumulated in different sub-cellular organelles with the use of appropriate transit or signal peptides. Usingtissue-specific promoters enables spatially-defined expres- sion of the transgene in applicable plant organs, such as leaves, seeds, fruits or tubers [31]. Nuclear-transformedplants offer tremendous simplicity for production of a vaccine product, as seed lines can be developed and propagation of plant biomass can utilize traditional agri-cultural technologies and infrastructure. Note, however, that nuclear-transformed plants typically express lower yields of recombinant proteins compared with transientexpression, require prolonged timeframes for generation and selection of transgenic seed lines, and require mea- sures to prevent environmental contamination due totransgene flow via open field cross-pollination [32]. Transgenic plants with transformed plastome (trans- plastomic plants) possess several beneficial traits, such asi) high-ploidy of plastome and lack of positional effects or transgene silencing, leading to synthesis of typically very high levels of recombinant proteins, ii) the ability to ex-press artificial operons, thus allowing expression of several proteins in one transformational step, and iii) tight trans- gene containment due to maternal inheritance of plastidDNA in most cultivated plants [33]. The absence of a gly- cosylation machinery in chloroplasts thwarts the expres- sion of proteins where glycans are essential for structure/conformation; however, this technology eliminates risks of addition of potentially allergenic non-mammalian glycans and offers advantages for expression of non-glycosylatedproteins of prokaryotic origin [34]. High yields of recombinant proteins can be obtained quickly with transient expression systems through use ofviral, virus-derived and non-viral expression vectors [30]. Infiltration of the leaf tissue with an Agrobacterium inter- mediate host containing any of these types of expressionvectors (agroinfiltration) is the most common method used for delivery of foreign DNA into plant cells. The main ad- vantage of the transient expression systems is the produc- tion speed that enables vaccines to be manufactured within periods as short as one month after obtaining the sequenceof the antigen [35]. However, transient expression systems are labor- and material-intensive procedures involving growing Agrobacterium cultures, and diluting them in infiltration cocktails, immersion of plant aerial biomass into the Agrobacterium suspension, infiltrating the agrobacteria into leaves by pulling and releasing a vac-uum to allow entry of Agrobacterium into the plant tis- sues [36]. These manipulations add cost to recombinant protein production, but have the advantage of using wildtype plants, which is viewed by regulatory authoritiesfavorably. The US Defense Advanced Research Program Agency (DARPA) has funded major infrastructure projects, such as Medicago 's [37] commercial-scale production facil- ity in the Research Triangle Park, NC, and Kentucky Bio- Processing 's [38] production facility in Owensboro, KY. Also, an improved viral vector-based inducible system thatcan be deployed for field production has recently been de- veloped [39]. Other plant-based production systems include algae and moss cell-suspension cultures grown in bioreactors. High-level containment and sterile growth conditions are advantages of these systems, compared to whole plants interms of good manufacturing practice (GMP) for recom- binant protein production, though the cost of these sys- tems is high, while scale-up ability is limited [40]. 4. Post-translational protein modifications in plants Although the genetic code is universal and a given nu-cleotide sequence results in the same order of amino acids in the polypeptide regardless of what organism is translating the RNA message, proteins differ in structuredepending on the organism they are produced in. This is due to the fact that a multitude of modifications can take place after the ribosomal synthesis of the polypep-tide, so called post-translational modifications (PTMs). In the case of therapeutic proteins these PTMs are of high importance, since they might alter the structure ofthe protein, its functionality and especially the mostprominent), which basically occur in vivo, but some might also occur during downstream processing of a given thera- peutic protein. Different organisms are capable of variousPTMs, e.g. bacteria do not glycosylate proteins, while eukaryotic organisms perform extensive glycomodifica- tions. Moreover, type and linkage of sugars vary consider-ably among cell types and organs, as well as at different developmental stages and environmental conditions, mak- ing this particular modification highly diverse. In the caseof recombinant therapeutics for parenteral administration, it is of importance to retain the native glycosylation pat- tern to avoid shortened half-life and unintended immuno-genicity. Plants do glycosylate recombinant proteins in a manner that differs from that in mammalian cell systems, and glycosylation may even vary among plant species, or-gans and cell types. In some cases this can even be an ad- vantage, exemplified by a recombinant glucocerebrosidase (taliglucerase alfa) made in carrot cells. Here, the sugarsadded to the produced recombinant enzyme more closely resemble the native structure with terminal mannose, making this product superior or \"biobetter \",c o m p a r e dt o the CHO cells-derived product [42]. As a further improve- ment, glycosylation machinery in plants can be engineered to produce mammalian-like glycan patterns with terminalKolotilin et al. Veterinary Research 2014, 45:117 Page 5 of 12 http://www.veterinaryresearch.org/content/45/1/117sialic acid, making the recombinant proteins almost indis- tinguishable from those produced in mammalian cell lines (see \"Glycoengineering \"in text). 5. Opportunities and advantages of plant systems 5.1 Storage/Shelf life/Purification Plant-based expression systems raise the possibility that antigens or antibodies can be produced in a form that is stable during storage and is amenable to extraction andpurification procedures [43]. Dried or lyophilized leafy biomass, as well as plant storage tissues, such as seeds, retain unchanged levels of accumulated recombinantproteins for years at normal room temperatures, thus re- ducing stowing costs and facilitating distribution without need for a cold chain [44,45]. Such a production systemwould allow stockpiling of the transgenic plant material (lyophilized leaf biomass or seeds) for manufacturing of rapid-response veterinary biologics targeted against patho-gens of epidemiological relevance. The time to product would then only be dependent on the speed of extraction and downstream processing, if purification is required, orimmediate, if formulated lyophilized biomass or whole seeds can be administered in feed [46]. Some plant-based expression strategies, such as the expression of recombin-ant antigens in oil bodies or implementation of particular protein tags are specifically focused at overcoming the complexities of purification procedures (reviewed in [47]).Although purified plant-derived biologics are functional and effective, a key benefit of plants is the ability to deliver recombinant pharmaceuticals as minimally processed feed,such as flour paste from edible tissues [48]. Expression in seeds may also help protect antigens from digestion within the intestinal tract, especially if they target the formationof protein bodies, which can increase the delivery of anti- gens to the mucosal surface [49]. Remarkably, of ectopic storage organelles as sink compartmentsfor recombinant proteins can be induced in tissues that are not adapted for storage functions [50]. 5.2 Glycoengineering Glycosylation affects the quality of recombinant pharma- ceuticals as different glycan structures can potentially in-fluence stability, subcellular targeting, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics and biological activity. The precise control and optimization of glycan modification tomanufacture homogeneous protein therapeutics with specific designer glycoform s that confer superior effi- cacy has therefore become an important issue for allproduction platforms, including mammalian cells. The mechanisms of N-glycosylation in plants and mam- mals differ in Golgi-specific modifications, such as theaddition of (1,2)-linked xylose and core (1,3)-linked fucose residues in plants, and the addition of (1,4)- linked galactose and sialic acid residues in mammals[51]. Therefore, strategies to control the glycosylation of recombinant proteins were established in plants early on, such as subcellular targeting to prevent the additionof certain sugar residues [52] and glycoengineering to replace sugars with more desirable counterparts [53]. A key example of glycan control by targeting is the firstcommercially available plant-derived human therapeutic protein, taliglucerase alfa, indicated for the lysosomal storage disorder called Gaucher 'sd i s e a s e .I nt h i sc a s e targeting to the plant vacuole resulted in the formation of glycan structures with terminal mannose residues pro- moting uptake of the recombinant protein via mannose-specific surface receptors on macrophages [54]. Engineering the plant N-glycosylation pathway has been achieved by various approaches including conventionalmutagenesis or homologous recombination, RNA interfer- ence and transgene expression [53]. The versatility of plants for the production of specific N-glycoforms hasturned a perceived disadvantage into one of the major strengths of plant production platforms. In addition to the abolition of (1,2)-linked xylose and core (1,3)- linked fucose residues, and the complete reconstruction of mammalian glycosylation pathways in plants [55], product-specific designer N-glycans have been engineeredfor improved efficacy. For example, glycoengineered plants can be used to produce glyco-optimized antibody versions with improved pharmacokinetic properties due to greaterreceptor affinity [56]. Another type of glycosylation whose impact is less widely known is the mucin-like O-glycosylation of serine,threonine and hydroxyproline residues, the latter being unique to plants. However, recent efforts have addressed the engineering of O-linked glycans [57]. It has been sug-gested that O-glycan structures may function as adjuvants, or may increase serum stability [51]. Tailored mammal-like O-glycan structures could also improve the stability andactivity of proteins such as erythropoietin and secretory IgA, giving plants a competitive edge for the production of these compounds. 5.3 Vaccine bioencapsulation and delivery Although plants have been shown to manufacturebiologically-active therapeutics in amounts sufficient for oral administration to livestock, plant-derived antigens require a formulation to protect them from the hostileenvironment of the gastro-intestinal tract, without inter- fering with the immunogenicity of the antigen. Depend- ing on the plant species and the plant tissue in whichthe subunit proteins are expressed, the plant matrix could provide some protection against these harsh con- ditions. Not only does this eliminate the need for costlypurification, but the provision of a durable matrix offers a protective and stabilizing effect beyond harvest and upon mucosal administration [58]. Any plant cell matrixKolotilin et al. Veterinary Research 2014, 45:117 Page 6 of 12 http://www.veterinaryresearch.org/content/45/1/117can be effective to enhance resistance against digestion, thereby increasing exposure of a vaccine to immune effector cells, but the protective effect can be further en-hanced by incorporation of the vaccine proteins into storage organelles [59]. The use of seeds is particularly suitable to achieve bioencapsulation of recombinant pro-teins in specialized storage organelles that are derived from the endomembrane system and allow proteins to accumulate within a protective matrix [52]. Clear benefitshave been demonstrated in seed-based production sys- tems as recombinant proteins expressed in rice or pea seeds were better protected from degradation than theirpurified counterparts upon oral delivery [60,61]. Never- theless, plant-based production could also negatively influ- immunogenicity of the antigen by influencingantigen folding, glycosylation and/or by interaction with the antigen, interfering with its capacity to target the mu- cosa [46]. The latter could be one of the reasons why F4fimbriae to which alfalfa crushed leaf biomass was added, showed a decreased immune response in pigs in compari- son with F4 without this plant material (Cox et al., unpub-lished results). 5.4 Scale-up and speed Scaling up production of recombinant proteins in trans- genic or transplastomic plants is much easier and less costly than similar scaling up in mammalian or micro-bial cells for the simple reason that each plant could be considered as a bioreactor and all that is required is sowing a seed and providing light, water and fertilizer, asopposed to an expensive upfront investment in infrastruc- ture and bioreactor facilities for cell cultures and the for- mulation of complex cell culture media. Therefore, scalingup or down can be achieved quickly with no major invest- ment. A single tobacco plant can produce over 150 000 seeds, allowing fast scale-up within a few months. To-bacco biomass yields can reach up to 100 tons/ha in a sin- gle field season [62]. If containment is necessary, a similar or higher yield is achievable in greenhouses; and high levelaccumulation of the desired protein at 1 g/kg fresh leaf weight means that 100 kg of a protein can be produced in a single hectare (Menassa et al., unpublished data). How-ever, using stable transgenic/transplastomic lines implies a lag time in producing a high expressing line and obtaining seed. In the case of a catastrophic epidemic or pandemic,much faster timelines are required. For this, transient pro- duction in Nicotiana benthamiana is ideal with a timeline from cloning of the genes to vaccine production of only afew weeks [35]. As well, this system obviates the need for production of transgenic plants, thus easing the regulatory framework for scale up. In this system, wild type Nicoti- ana benthamiana plants are grown in greenhouses and infiltrated with Agrobacterium cultures containing the expression construct required for recombinant proteinproduction. The infiltrated plants are harvested 4-10 days post-infiltration, and the protein is purified. Several companies (Medicago Inc., Fraunhofer USA, KentuckyBioProcessing LLC) have adopted this system for produc- tion of influenza vaccines and monoclonal antibodies [35,63,64]. The MagnICON\u00ae system developed by ICONGenetics allows the production and purifica- tion of monoclonal antibodies at an expected yield of 250 mg/kg plant fresh weight [63], and Medicago Inc. wasable to produce 10 million doses of influenza vaccine within one month in their 97 000 square foot facility in North Carolina. 6. Examples of therapeutic proteins produced in plants 6.1 Antibodies It has been more than 25 years since the first IgG antibody was expressed in plants. Since then, there have been nu-merous publications in the scientific literature on the pro- duction of antibodies in plants, such as those targeting bacteria, cancer targets and highly pathogenic viruses suchas HIV and Ebola [66]. The current epidemic caused by the Ebola virus in West Africa has brought attention to a plant-produced antibody cocktail. This cocktail, calledZMAPP , was recently shown to reverse advanced Ebola disease in 100% of tested Rhesus macaques [67]. Six publi- cations describe the production of five of 38 approvedtherapeutic antibodies in plants (Table 1). Therapeutic and prophylactic antibodies are required in massive amounts and on a constant basis, and mighttherefore be produced more economically by using trans- genic plants rather than fermentation. In addition, neutral- izing antibodies indicated as topical or oral microbicidescan also be delivered in plant material such as seeds, as demonstrated by the administration of peas containing single-chain antibodies with high sporozoite-neutralizingactivity against the coccidiosis parasite, Eimeria tenella, for the prevention of gastrointestinal infections in chick- ens [60]. In another, more recent study the protection ofweaned piglets against enterotoxigenic E. coli infection was achieved by the oral administration of seeds produ- cing IgA [72]. Whereas simple proteins such as single chain antibody fragments tend to be easily expressed in bacteria, complex glycoproteins such as monoclonal antibodies usually re-quire eukaryotic production systems. Full size antibodies tend to be expressed well in plants because the secretory pathway in plant cells contains an extensive molecularchaperone system. Plants are particularly beneficial for the production of secretory IgA molecules because they can produce all four of the polypeptide components and as-semble a fully functional molecule [73]. In contrast, three of the protein components are produced by plasma cells in mammals, but the fourth is produced by epithelial cells,Kolotilin et al. Veterinary Research 2014, 45:117 Page 7 of 12 http://www.veterinaryresearch.org/content/45/1/117and assembly can only occur in the extracellular environ- ment. Secretory IgA assembly can also be achieved in CHO cells carrying the four different transgenes, but theefficiency of assembly is low [74]. Therefore, plants offer a valuable and superior large-scale production system for this preferred format of mucosal antibodies. 6.2 Antigens: VLPs Viral diseases are probably the most important culpritfor the severe economic losses in livestock production worldwide. Although antibiotics are not used to treat or prevent viral infection outbreaks, pathogenic viruses oftenpredispose infected animals for secondary bacterial infec- tions, which do require antibiotic treatment. Thus, pre- ventive vaccinations to control primary viral infectionshelp to reduce the need for antibiotics application in live- stock production. Virus-like particles (VLPs) are defined as multisubunit protein structures with self-assembling competence that show an identical or highly similar overall structure to the corresponding native viruses [75]. Studies documenta high immunogenic capacity of VLPs due to their dis- play of multiple repeated antigenic motifs, which trigger B cell activation and elicit higher antibody titers com-pared to monomeric antigens. Strong humoral immune responses could be induced by VLPs without adjuvants, while avoiding stimulation of inflammatory T cell re-sponses [76]. Many different VLPs (more than 100) origin- ating from phages and plant, insect, and vertebrate viruses have been described and summarized in an excellentreview [75], including examples of the preparative and large-scale manufacturing of VLPs in bacteria, yeast cells, insect cells and mammalian cells. Mason et al. first demonstrated that the expression of human hepatitis B virus structural proteins in plants results in enveloped VLPs that \"bud-out \"as spherical particles of off the intracellular mem- branes [77]. The further engineering of enveloped B virus VLPs into nanoparticles allowed the displayof large foreign antigens or the development of bivalent vaccines [78]. Simultaneous transient expression of four distinct structural proteins of Bluetongue virus (BTV)led to assembly of heteromultimeric VLPs able to elicit a strong antibody response in sheep, which provided protect- ive immunity against BTV challenge [79]. Another exampleof VLPs produced in plants with improved transient expression is Norwalk virus-derived non-enveloped VLPs [80]. Lettuce containing low levels of secondary metabo-lites has been used to develop a robust plant virus-based production platform for VLPs derived from the Norwalk virus capsid and combined with a scalable processingmethod [81]. The concept of producing VLPs in plants is generally connected to the idea of edible vaccines [75]. However,there are several hurdles to resolve before this concept could be implemented, despite all of its obvious benefits. Quality control issues and precise formulation of vaccineproducts, as well as documented control by the relevant regulatory bodies would preclude easy on-site produc- tion in food/feed plant organs. The administration ofsuch vaccines has to be regulated to avoid insufficient antigen application or, vice versa, to avoid the develop- ment of immune tolerance. Even orally administered VLP-type vaccines will have to be at least processed, enriched, formulated and applied under supervision, to ensure re- producible results [29]. Both the most recent and the most successful application of the plant-based VLP concept has been by Medicago Inc. (for review see [35]). A proprietary, plant-based transientexpression system has been developed to produce vaccines made of budded influenza hemagglutinin particles [82]. The developed platform allowed the vaccine to be pro-duced within one month of the disclosure of hemagglutinin sequences, from identified st rains as H1N1 [82]. Because many influenza types (i.e. H5N1, H1N1) are zoonotic dis-eases, vaccination with plant-based VLPs has to be further developed especially in terms of lowering down-stream pro- cessing costs to fit into the eco nomic constraints associated with a veterinary vaccine. An excellent comparative sum- mary of different plant-based vaccines including expression levels, immunogenicity, VLP strategies and anticipated cost is given in a review by Scotti and Rybicki [83]. The authors conclude that proof of efficacy was demonstrated for sev-eral plant-based VLP vaccines and plant-based expression systems could do as well as conventional production sys- tems based on fermentation. They claim a rather optimis-tic future of plant-based VLPs, if real costs are in the predicted range. 6.3 Subunit vaccines The concept of using plants as expression hosts for vet-erinary subunit vaccines has been studied extensively within the past two decades. However, only a few studiesTable 1 PubMed listings for therapeutic antibodies produced in plants Antibody (generic Research 2014, 45:117 Page 8 of 12 http://www.veterinaryresearch.org/content/45/1/117have tested the efficacy of plant-made subunit vaccines in farm animals. This section summarizes examples show- ing immunization data with host species. 6.3.1 Poultry In 2006 Dow Agro Sciences obtained USDA approvalfor a plant cell culture-based vaccine for poultry against Newcastle disease virus [84]. This vaccine was composed of recombinant hemagglutinin-neuraminidase proteinexpressed in transgenic tobacco suspension cells and formulated as an injectable vaccine. Other studies on Newcastle disease virus include expression of full-sizeglycoproteins in transgenic potato and tobacco leaves, maize and rice seeds (reviewed in [85]). The antigens were shown to be immunogenic and protective in chick-ens after oral delivery. An edible potato-based vaccine has been developed against chicken infectious bronchitis virus [86].Sliced tubers expressing viral S1 over two weeks; chickens were chal- lenged with IBV one week after the last administration.Orally immunized chickens developed a virus-specific antibody response and were protected against IBV. An- other research group succeeded in vaccinating chickensagainst infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) with protein. Chickens orally immunized with Ara- bidopsis crude leaf extracts or transgenic rice seeds were protected to a similar level achieved with a commercial in- jectable vaccine [87]. Recently, the VP2 antigen was pro- duced in neutralizing antibodies in immunized chickens [88]. 6.3.2 Swine The use of maize seeds as an edible delivery vehicle against porcine Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) has been extensively studied. The envelope spikeprotein was used as an antigen to raise neutralizing anti- bodies and the efficacy of this plant-made vaccine has been presented in experiments with piglets [89]. In addition, itwas found that the antigen was stable during storage in various conditions and authors were able to concentrate the antigen using milling techniques. Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) causing post-weaning diarrhea in piglets has been a target for a plant-made vaccine. The major subunit protein of ETEC F4 fimbriaehas been expressed in the leaves of tobacco [90], alfalfa [46] and in seeds of barley [91]. This subunit vaccine was shown to be immunogenic and partially protective afteroral delivery to weaned piglets [46]. protein VP1 of the disease virus (FMDV) was used to substitutea part of Bamboo mosaic virus coat protein, resulting in display of the epitope on virions that retained their infectivity and could be propagated in plants [92]. Itwas demonstrated that immunization with the extracted chimeric virions by intramuscular injection could fully protect pigs against FMDV challenge by effectively indu-cing humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. 6.3.3 Cattle Transgenic peanut plants expressing bovine Rinderpest virus hemaglutinin raised immune responses in cattle [93]. This oral vaccine was able to raise virus-specific anti-bodies which also neutralized the virus in vitro. Immuno- genicity of a Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)-based vaccine against bovine herpes virus (BHV) was studied in cattle[94]. Immunogenic glycoprotein D was produced as a by- product in TMV-inoculated tobacco plants, and the crude plant extract emulsified in oil and subsequently injectedinto cattle was able to raise specific humoral and cellular immune responses. Most importantly, cattle were pro- tected against BHV to similar levels as those vaccinatedwith the commercial vaccine. A plant-made subunit vaccine against Bovine viral diar- rhea virus (BVDV) has been developed in Argentina. Thestructural protein E2 of BVDV was expressed in transgenic alfalfa as a fusion to a peptide for targeting the product to antigen-presenting cells [95]. Partially purified antigen wasadministered intramuscularl y to calves and protected them against BVDV challenge. 6.4 Toxic proteins Although the efficacy of treatments with classical antibi- otics is declining due to the widespread development ofantibiotic resistance among major pathogenic bacteria, there are very little alternatives for fighting infections. One novel therapeutic option could be the use of phagelysins - enzymes that target and hydrolyze bacterial cell walls, efficiently killing a large array of bacteria [96]. How- ever, due to the toxic nature of these proteins, their pro-duction in bacteria cannot be achieved, limiting the availability for testing or manufacture. The lack of the spe- cific, bacterial-type cell wall structures targeted by lysinsmakes plants an alternative platform for production of therapeutic proteins which are highly toxic to bacteria. In a promising report [97], Oey et al. showed that by target-ing the genes encoding the lysozyme Cpl-1 and the ami- dase Pal to the tobacco plastome, functional lysins could be synthesized and accumulated at high levels in chloro-plasts. Several reports described successful transplastomic as well as transient expression-mediated production of short anti-microbial peptides, analogs of secreted defen-sins, which can be used for control of bacterial, viral and fungal infections [98-100]. Hence, plants represent a valu- able production system for anti-microbial toxic proteins,offering cost-effective solution to obtain large quantities of proteinaceous antibiotics that could be administered through feed.Kolotilin et al. Veterinary Research 2014, 45:117 Page 9 of 12 http://www.veterinaryresearch.org/content/45/1/1177. Conclusions The use of vaccines and prophylactics for the control of infectious diseases in the livestock industry will grow as antibiotics applications diminish. Plants as bioreactors comprise a valuable option for production of recombinant protein therapeutics for animal health. In recent years nu- merous studies demonstrated the feasibility and advantages of plant-based production platforms for various proteins with therapeutic use, including complex antibodies, sub- unit vaccines and immunogenic virus-like particles. Plant- made therapeutic products are currently on the cusp of widely entering biotechnology markets. Interaction and concerted actions of the plant biotechnology sector with veterinarians and regulatory authorities will facilitate devel- opment of novel approaches to su stainable, antibiotic-free livestock 8.
