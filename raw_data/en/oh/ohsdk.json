If you have any questions about how to begin your journey at MCW, we're here to help! COVID-19 Guidance and Policies The MCW Medical School recognizes that prospective applicants may have faced or are facing additional challenges while preparing to apply for medical school admission during the COVID-19 pandemic. Please review the following for application guidance and policies specific to MCW Medical School during the 2024 application cycle. MCW requires our employees and learners to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, or to have an approved exemption for medical or religious reasons. The requirement went into effect on November 1, 2021. Our response to COVID-19 continues to evolve due to the fluid nature of the situation. These policies are accurate as of May 25, 2023 but are continuously being evaluated and are subject to change. - We will continue our commitment to holistic admissions and encourage applicants to share context regarding their individual situation on the MCW secondary application essay prompt. - We will accept pass/fail grades for coursework, including prerequisites, taken during the COVID-19 pandemic (including January 2020 - Summer Term 2023). As prerequisite coursework is intended to prepare applicants for the MCAT exam and for medical school coursework, applicants should ensure they have obtained mastery of the course material regardless of the grading system. - We will continue to consider completion date as one factor in our admissions process (i.e. \"rolling admissions\"); however, we acknowledge that external factors may impact application completion date for some applicants this cycle. - Interview day programming and interviews will be conducted virtually using Zoom. This applies to Regular MD applicants at all three campuses, MD/MS applicants, and MSTP applicants. - Optional, in-person campus visit opportunities will be available during the application cycle for admitted applicants. At this time, we continue to strongly encourage virtual meetings. Please review the virtual opportunities to connect with our office. In-person visits may be scheduled on a very limited basis. Individual Meetings We look forward to connecting with you! We are hosting virtual one-on-one advising appointments and group Info Sessions periodically. Each Info Session will begin with a 20-minute presentation about MCW and the medical school application process and will end with a 40-minute Q&A with admissions representatives. [Sign up for a one-on-one appointment or an Info Session](https://calendly.com/mcwmedicalschool/). Group Presentations If you're a pre-med advisor, or the leader of a pre-med group or organization and would like to request a virtual presentation for your school or group, please email us directly at [medschool@mcw.edu](mailto:medschool@mcw.edu). We would be happy to set up a date and time to connect with your specific audience.

Application Requirements To matriculate at MCW, you must have earned a bachelor's degree or a minimum of 90 earned postsecondary credits (excluding AP, IB, CLEP or similar credits). All required credits, including prerequisites, must be earned at a college or university located in the United States (US) or Canada and accredited by a state, regional or federal accrediting agency prior to matriculation at MCW. No credit will be given for coursework taken outside of the US or Canada. Individual exceptions may be considered for applicants attending regionally accredited* institutions located outside of the US or Canada. The [Medical College Admissions Test](https://students-residents.aamc.org/applying-medical-school/taking-mcat-exam/) (MCAT) exam is required of all applicants. We will only accept scores from tests taken within the three-year period prior to matriculation. For 2024 entry, you must have taken the exam no earlier than January 2021. During the 2024 application cycle, MCW will accept applications from US Citizens, US Permanent Residents, and DACA recipients. We anticipate welcoming international applicants to MCW-Milwaukee in a future application cycle. All applicants who are not US Citizens or US Permanent Residents must be prepared to submit a Certification of Finances form and provide supporting documentation for the total cost of attendance to the Financial Aid Office after being admitted to MCW Medical School. This information is not required to complete the application, but needs to be submitted and approved by April 30 of the matriculation year. Statistical information can be found within the [Medical School Admission Requirements (MSAR) database](https://mec.aamc.org/msar-ui/#/medSchoolDetails/141). The MSAR is a useful resource to browse, search, sort, and compare information about US and Canadian medical schools and programs. *Acceptable regional accreditation organizations include: [Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges (ACCJC) Wester Association of Schools and Colleges](https://www.chea.org/regional-accrediting-organizations#western-junior) [Higher Learning Commission (HLC)](https://www.chea.org/regional-accrediting-organizations#north-central) [Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE)](https://www.chea.org/regional-accrediting-organizations#middle-states) [New England Commission of Higher Education (NECHE)](https://www.chea.org/regional-accrediting-organizations#new-england-institutions) [Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU)](https://www.chea.org/regional-accrediting-organizations#northwest) [Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC)](https://www.chea.org/regional-accrediting-organizations#southern) [WASC Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC)](https://www.chea.org/regional-accrediting-organizations#western-senior) While it is recommended that all prerequisites be completed prior to taking the MCAT, completion of the prerequisites is not a requirement to have an application reviewed, be interviewed, or receive an offer of admission. Completion of all prerequisites is a requirement for matriculation, and must be fulfilled by June 1 of the matriculation year. To ensure accurate academic records, all final, official transcripts from every post-secondary institution attended must be submitted directly to the MCW Office of Admissions by June 1 of the matriculation year. Transcripts must come directly from the educational institutions and include posted degrees. AMCAS does not forward transcripts to medical schools. All prerequisites must be taken at a regionally accredited college or university located in the United States or Canada. We will accept pass/fail grades for coursework, including prerequisites, taken during the COVID-19 pandemic (including January 2020 - Summer Term 2023). If you are on the quarter or trimester system, three quarters or trimesters are required. Prerequisites Biology 3-4 credits (1 semester) Advanced Biology Courses such as Anatomy & Physiology, Immunology, Microbiology or Neurobiology will satisfy this requirement. Chemistry 3-4 credits (1 semester) Biochemistry Provided the course required General and Organic Chemistry as prerequisites. Physics 6-8 credits (2 semesters) Physics Typically Physics I and Physics II will fulfill this requirement. Math 3-4 credits (1 semester) Math Statistics is recommended. English 3-4 credits (1 semester) English May use a writing-intensive course to satisfy this requirement. Social Science 3-4 credits (1 semester) Psychology or Sociology - A course in oral communications (speech, interpersonal communication, etc.) is recommended. - AP coursework will be accepted for the Physics, Math, English, and Social Science requirements. - CLEP credit will be accepted for the Math, English, and Social Science requirements. The [Medical College Admissions Test](https://students-residents.aamc.org/applying-medical-school/taking-mcat-exam/) (MCAT) exam is required of all applicants. For 2024 entry, you must have taken the exam no earlier than January 2021. If you have taken the MCAT exam more than once, the Admissions Committee will mix-and-match the two most recent eligible exams to consider the best overall score. Completion of the [Casper test](https://acuityinsights.app/casper/) is mandatory for all MCW Medical School applicants. Casper is an online, open-response situational judgement test which assesses non-cognitive skills and interpersonal characteristics that we believe are important for successful students and physicians. This information will complement other tools we use for applicant screening, evaluation, and review and will further enhance the fairness and objectivity of our holistic review and selection process. Acuity Insights Assessments offers the opportunity to complete a standardized, multi-part online assessment consisting of [Casper](https://acuityinsights.app/casper/) (90-110 minutes) and [Duet](https://acuityinsights.app/duet/) (15 minutes). Though you will be prompted to participate in both components, the only required assessment we will use as part of your application evaluation is your [Casper test](https://acuityinsights.app/casper/) score. The Admissions Committee will not know who has completed Duet, or be able to review the content, so participation (or lack thereof) in that assessment will not impact your candidacy at MCW. AAMC PREview is not required, nor will it be accepted as a substitute for Casper. Acceptable Test Dates We will accept Casper test scores from May 4, 2023 through December 7, 2023. Your application will not be considered complete or reviewed for possible interview selection until MCW has received your Casper test score. This means you must complete the Casper test and select MCW Medical School for distribution before the posted Distribution Deadline. Keep in mind that it takes about 4 weeks for us to receive your score, so we highly recommend that you take the test early in the application cycle. Remember: Casper test scores are only valid for one admissions cycle. If you took the Casper test as part of a previous year's application, you are required to retake the test this cycle as well. Acuity Insights Fee Structure The base fee to take the Casper test is $85, which includes 7 program distributions. Each additional program distribution is $16. Casper fees are waived for those approved for the AAMC Fee Assistance Program. Technology Requirements In order to take the Casper test, you must have access to a laptop or desktop computer with webcam and audio capabilities and a reliable internet connection with an internet speed of at least 1.5 Mbps and upload speed of at least 2 Mbps on your selected test date. The Casper test cannot be taken using a mobile device, tablet, or iPad. How to Register for the Casper Test - Go to [AcuityInsights.app](https://acuityinsights.app/)to sign up for Acuity Insights Assessments for Medicine (Allopathic) (CSP-10111 - U.S. Medicine), and register using your AAMC ID and a government-issued photo ID. - Important: Ensure you've entered your AAMC ID accurately, as a discrepancy may slow down our receipt of your Casper test score. - Select a Casper test date. Again, MCW will accept test scores from May 4, 2023 through December 7, 2023, but we highly recommend that you take the test early in the application cycle. - Important: These are the only testing dates available for your Casper test. It is unlikely there will be additional tests scheduled, but the most up to date information can be found by browsing the [Test Dates and Times](https://acuityinsights.app/dates-times/). Please use an email address that you check regularly and that you have used for your application; there may be updates to the test schedule. - Important: To account for identity verification and payment processing timeline, register for your test at least 3 days before your preferred test date and time. Last-minute bookings are not recommended. - Important: These are the only testing dates available for your Casper test. It is unlikely there will be additional tests scheduled, but the most up to date information can be found by browsing the - Ensure you have selected MCW Medical School for distribution before each posted Distribution Deadline. You will not be allowed to send scores to MCW after each posted Distribution Deadline has passed. Accommodations If you require testing accommodations to complete your Acuity Insights Assessments, you should submit an Initial Request Form (Part 1 and 2) at least four (4) weeks prior to your scheduled Casper test date. More information regarding Acuity's accommodations policy can be [found here](https://intercom.help/acuityinsights/en/articles/4731327-acuity-insights-assessments-accommodations). Preparation No studying is required for Casper. Acuity Insights is not affiliated with any test prep company, nor do they endorse any third-party services.

Acuity will email test takers when their quartile results are available, and they can be viewed in your account at [AcuityInsights.app](https://acuityinsights.app/). Questions & Support Please direct any inquiries on Acuity Insights Assessments to [support@acuityinsights.app](mailto:support@acuityinsights.app?subject=Casper%20test%20inquiry). Alternatively, you may use the chat bubble in the bottom right hand corner of your screen on the [AcuityInsights.app](https://acuityinsights.app/) website.

Letters must be submitted in one of the following formats: - Committee letter - Packet of letters - Two individual letters from classroom professors, one of whom must have taught biology, chemistry, physics, or a comparable science discipline. Graduate Letters: It is strongly recommended that applicants currently or previously enrolled in a degree-granting graduate program submit one letter of recommendation from a professor or thesis advisor.

You may elect to submit graduate letters of recommendation for undergraduate letters in some circumstances, or when unable to acquire undergraduate letters. Optional Letters: You may submit up to three optional letters. These letters are not required. For optimal consideration, these should be received by MCW before the application is complete. - If you are applying to the MD/PhD (MSTP) or MD/MS program, it is strongly recommended that you include a letter of recommendation speaking to your ability to become a physician-scientist. - Letters from Principal Investigators may be submitted as optional letters, but typically cannot fulfill the undergraduate or graduate letter requirements. Letter Format - Letters of recommendation must be on official letterhead and signed by the author(s). - If the letter-writer is a Teaching Assistant, the letter must be co-signed by the Professor of the course. - It is your responsibility to confirm that each letter-writer understands and complies with these requirements. - Letters of recommendation are accepted via US Postal Service and electronic providers including AMCAS, VirtualEvals, and Interfolio. If you are requesting an exception, such as waiving undergraduate or graduate letters, please contact the Office of Admissions at [medschool@mcw.edu](mailto:medschool@mcw.edu) or (414) 955-8246. How to Apply The primary application to the Medical College of Wisconsin must be initiated through the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS). Secondary applications will be sent to all eligible applicants upon MCW's receipt of your verified AMCAS application. If you received an email with login credentials for the MCW Secondary Application, please complete the application. If you have not received that email, or a communication that you are ineligible to apply, please check your spam or junk mail folders and contact the Office of Admissions. You will designate your campus preferences on the secondary application. There is only one secondary application and one application fee, regardless of campus preferences. Please familiarize yourself with the mission and opportunities available at each campus location before submitting your application. Since MCW-Central Wisconsin and MCW-Green Bay have small class sizes of primarily Wisconsin residents, there are limited spaces available for non-residents. These forms are not required of all applicants. Please review the requirements of each form, and complete the form(s) that pertain to you. All forms are in PDF format. You will need the free [Adobe Reader](https://www.adobe.com/) to view and print the forms. [Dean's Certification](/-/media/MCW/Education/Medical-School/Documents/MCW-Deans-Certification-Form.pdf): This form is required if you have indicated on the AMCAS application or on our Secondary Application that an institutional action has been taken against you. It is also required if you have previously matriculated at a medical school regardless of the reason for departure. Provide this form with your explanation to the appropriate office at the institution for verification. It will then be sent directly to us by your institution. If applicable to you, this form is required to complete your application. [Wisconsin Residency Form](/-/media/MCW/Education/Academic-Affairs/Financial-Aid-and-Tuition/Wisconsin-Residency-HEAB-Form.pdf): If you are considered a Wisconsin resident for tuition purposes, complete and send this form to the Higher Educational Aids Board (HEAB) in Madison, WI. This form must be approved prior to matriculation to qualify for the Wisconsin Medical Student Tuition Assistance program, but it is not required to complete your secondary application. Please note: Private colleges do NOT participate in the tuition reciprocity program because they do not charge non-resident tuition rates. Therefore, the [Minnesota/Wisconsin reciprocity agreement](http://www.ohe.state.mn.us/mPg.cfm?PageID=121)does not apply to MCW students. [Technical Standards](/-/media/MCW/Education/Medical-School/Documents/Technical-Standards-Final-Version-October-2017.pdf): The Technical Standards for Admission, Retention, Promotion and Graduation consist of the minimum physical, cognitive and emotional requirements to provide reasonable assurance that students can complete the entire course of study and participate fully in all aspects of medical training. Current students review and sign the Technical Standards annually. [Credit Report](https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action): All admitted and waitlisted applicants are required to submit a copy of their credit report to be approved by the Financial Aid Office by the deadline date provided in their acceptance or waitlist letter. Credit reports can be requested on the [Annual Credit Report website](https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action). If you have no credit history, [this form](/-/media/MCW/Education/Medical-School/Documents/No-Credit-History-Form.pdf)is required. Additional documentation may be required by the Financial Aid Office on a case-by-case basis. [Certification of Finances](/-/media/MCW/Education/Academic-Affairs/Financial-Aid-and-Tuition/Certification-of-Finances.pdf): If you are not a US Citizen, you must submit the Certification of Finances form and documentation to the Financial Aid Office. You are encouraged to complete and submit this documentation early after being admitted or placed on the waitlist; this is not required to complete your application but needs to be submitted and approved well in advance of matriculation. MCW Medical School expects admitted applicants to matriculate in the class for which they were interviewed. In limited instances, an admitted applicant may request a one-year deferment of matriculation for personal reasons, professional development reasons, or extenuating circumstances. Examples include significant personal or family health challenges, childbirth or adoption, meaningful professional growth opportunities (e.g., Fulbright scholarship), service in the military or Peace Corps, or unforeseen circumstance that would seriously impact the applicant's ability to succeed as a medical student. The request must be in writing using the appropriate form, must describe the specific reason(s) for the request, and may be submitted only after all stipulations of acceptance have been met. Students may only request deferment for the campus to which they have been admitted. Decisions to grant deferred matriculation are made on a case-by-case basis, and the MCW Admissions Committee reserves the right to limit the number of deferred matriculants in any entering class. Decisions on deferred matriculation requests will be communicated in May of the matriculation year. The Medical College of Wisconsin only considers transfer applications from students demonstrating hardship into its third-year curriculum at MCW-Milwaukee from LCME-accredited schools. This is rare, as it is contingent on available space. The transfer application to matriculate in July 2023 with the M3 class is now closed. For the M3 class beginning in July 2024, it is not yet determined if there is limited space available. All completed transfer applications will be reviewed after December 1, 2023. Interviews will be offered to eligible and qualified applicants with final decisions sent by the end of February 2024. If accepted for transfer, you must plan to be available and on-campus by mid-June 2024. View the [Medical School academic calendar](/education/academic-and-student-services/Registrar/academic-calendars) for additional details. To complete a transfer application for potential matriculation as an M3 in July 2024, please complete the [MCW Medical School Transfer Application](https://mcwisc.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_4Z8oUHCFymd7Vcx). Again, the deadline for an entirely complete application is December 1, 2023. A complete application includes additional required documents outlined in that link. Interview Information - Academic Achievement - MCAT and CASPer Scores - Personal Statement and Essays - Letters of Recommendation - Experiences - Non-Cognitive Personal and Professional Characteristics - Personal Interview Interviews are typically offered from September to March. All invitations to interview will be sent via email. Interview space is limited, and reservations are taken on a first-come, first-served basis. Each interview invitation will state the campus where you are invited to interview. We feel it is important that you have the opportunity to experience the campus where you may be matriculating. If you are offered admission, it will be at a specific campus and is not transferrable. It is possible, but highly unlikely, that you will be invited to interview at multiple campus locations. Interview invitations are based on many factors. MCW cannot guarantee that you will be invited to interview at your first choice ranked campus. If you interviewed and are admitted to multiple campus locations, you will be given the choice of which offer you want to continue to hold. The interview day schedule and timing will differ depending on campus location; however, you can expect to spend about six hours on campus for interview day activities. After You Are Admitted Your $110 non-refundable deposit must be received by the MCW Medical School Office of Admission by close of business on April 30 (or the following business day if April 30 falls on a weekend). If you are admitted from the waitlist after April 30, the deadline to turn in the deposit will be stated in the offer letter. Your deposit should be paid online through your secondary application portal. - Pay your $110 non-refundable deposit and formally accept your offer through your secondary application portal. - Read and sign the Technical Standards for Admission to and Graduation from MCW Medical School document. - Complete the Wisconsin residency form and send to HEAB in Madison, WI (if applicable). - Complete your Criminal Background Check.

Be prepared to send a course description or syllabus, if requested. - Send MCW final, official transcripts directly from all post-secondary institutions you've attended with degree conferral dates, if applicable. AMCAS does not forward your hard copy transcripts to us at any point in the application process, so you must have them sent directly to us from each institution. Any applicable degree conferral dates must be posted, so please make sure those will be on the transcript prior to sending. Transcripts may be sent in the mail or electronically to [medschool@mcw.edu](mailto:medschool@mcw.edu?subject=Medical%20School%20admissions%20inquiry). - Send your credit report and any other required financial documentation requested of you to the Financial Aid Office ( [finaid@mcw.edu](mailto:finaid@mcw.edu)). - Complete certification in adult and pediatric CPR & AED. - Deadlines will be stated in your offer letter.
