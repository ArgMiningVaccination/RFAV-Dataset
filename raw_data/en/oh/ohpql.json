The committee met pursuant to notice, at the Brynhild Haugland Room, North Dakota State Capitol Building, Hon. Byron Dorgan(vice chairman of the committee) presiding. Present: Senator Dorgan and Representative Pomeroy STATEMENT OF HON. BYRON L. DORGAN, U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH DAKOTA, VICE CHAIRMAN, COMMITTEE ON INDIANAFFAIRS Senator D ORGAN . The hearing will come to order. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for being here. This is a hearing of the U.S. Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, it isan official hearing of the committee. My name is Byron Dorgan, Iam vice chairman of the committee. The chairman is Senator JohnMcCain from the State of Arizona. We are conducting this hearingwith the consent of Senator McCain and the rest of the committee. I am joined today by the Chief of Staff of Senator McCain on the Committee on Indian Affairs, Jeanne Bumpus, right over here, andthe Chief of Staff on the minority side is Sara Garland. I am alsojoined by my colleague, Congressman Earl Pomeroy, who, althoughnot a member of the Committee on Indian Affairs, by consent of thecommittee is going to sit in today and be a part of this. I am verypleased that Congressman Pomeroy could join us, because he toois concerned about this important issue. I do want to make a couple of opening comments, and then we have three panels of witnesses who will testify today. If there istime following that, I would like to open it up for some additionalcomments. First, let me say that the topic of this hearing is teen suicide on reservations. It is a difficult and very sensitive issue and frankly,not easy to talk about. I suspect everyone in this room would preferthat we not have to talk about it. But we find ourselves in themidst of very serious problems that are not going to go away, andI think we do a disservice by not confronting this, looking it in theeye and trying to determine what can we do about it. I am shocked by some of the statistics that one reads. Teen sui- cides on Indian reservations are double those in the rest of ourcountry. In the northern Great Plains, they are 10 times that of the2 rest of the country. It is a very serious problem. And I think every- one who is in this room gathered for this hearing understands thewrenching heartbreak and the senseless loss of these young boysand girls who have their entire lives before them, but then decideto take their lives. I will make every effort at this hearing to be sensitive and re- sponsible in how this information is conveyed to the public. I knowyou will as well. But I must tell you, I am no longer comfortableon a range of very sensitive and serious issues to be quiet and justsay, well, what's happening is happening and we're a little worriedabout talking about it publicly. I am worried about not doingenough to save the lives of these young boys and girls. I am wor-ried that we do not devote the resources, we do not have the strate-gies that are necessary to save the lives of these young boys andgirls. With the consent of the family, last year I spoke on the floor of the Senate about a young girl named Avis Little Wind who tookher life. She was 14 years old. She lived on a reservation here inNorth Dakota. I not only spoke about that on the floor of the Sen-ate with their consent, I also went to that reservation and met withschool officials, this little girl's classmates, people involved in men-tal health, people from the tribal authorities, to try to understandwhat causes this sort of thing. I discovered from that that there is a lot we don't know. I also discovered that some of the basic resources that need to be avail-able to reach out to help these young people are not available. Weneed to fix that. There is nothing more precious in this countrythan our children. So I am holding this hearing, we have a group of witnesses that is pretty diverse, from a 15-year old high school student to thehead of the Indian Health Service in Washington, DC. And we hopeto receive guidance, expert advice, insight and from that try to de-velop some strategies that we think will work to save lives. Let me now call upon my colleague, Congressman Pomeroy, and again, thank him for being with us today. STATEMENT OF HON. EARL POMEROY, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FROM NORTH DAKOTA Mr. P OMEROY . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am very pleased that you are having this Indian Affairs hear- ing here in Bismarck, to elicit direct testimony on this extremelytroubling issue of teen suicides on our reservations. I could notagree with you more strongly that although it is difficult to talkabout, we need to have a better understanding of what is happen-ing, so that we can respond to it. I believe that we need to look carefully at the funding of mental health resources available to young people on our reservations, pos-sibly there is some Federal culpability in this problem. We have tounderstand it before we can figure out how to appropriately ad-dress it. That's why this hearing is so important. I appreciate yourletting me participate this morning. I was able to rearrange myschedule upon hearing that you would be here. I just think thereis nothing more important before us than the topic you have ad-vanced today, and I look forward to the testimony.3 Senator D ORGAN . Congressman Pomeroy, thank you very much. Prior to the first panel coming forward, I am going to ask Cecelia Myreon with the Turtle Mountain Chippewa Tribe to offer theopening prayer. Ms. M YREON . I am going to be praying in Chippewa. The Creator knows all languages, so you can just pray with me. [Prayer offered in native tongue.]Ms. M YREON . Megwich. Thank you. Senator D ORGAN . Cecelia, thank you very much. Now we will ask the Two Nation Drummers to come forward.[Drumming presentation.]Senator D ORGAN . That was Dave Ripley and Dennis Bursey. Thank you very much.Let me call panel 1 to the table, if I might. Charles Grim, direc- tor, Indian Health Service. He is accompanied by Jon Perez, direc-tor, Behavioral Health, Indian Health Service. We also haveUlonda Shamwell, division director, Office of Policy Planning andBudget and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Adminis-tration, accompanied by Dr. Denise Middelbrook, public health ana-lyst in the same Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Ad-ministration. Let me thank all of you for coming to Bismarck, ND today, and let me call first on Dr. Grim, the head of the Indian Health Service.Dr. Grim, you may proceed. STATEMENT OF CHARLES GRIM, DIRECTOR, INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE; ACCOMPANIED BY JON PEREZ, DIRECTOR,DIVISION OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES Mr. G RIM. Thank you, Senator Dorgan. Good morning. I am Charles Grim, director, Indian Health Service. Today I am accom-panied by Jon Perez, our director for the Division of BehavioralHealth Services. We thank you for giving us this opportunity to testify on teen suicide among American Indian youth, and I do agree with youthat it is time that we began discussing this issue with all our com-munities and children become more aware about it and what wecan do to treat it. I would ask that you enter my written statement for the record.Senator D ORGAN . Without objection. Mr. G RIM. Suicide in Indian country, in contrast to most of the rest of the U.S. population, is characterized by higher rates, andfrom younger people, very often affecting entire communities as aresult of suicide clustering. We would also like to share with youour concerns and efforts related to the recent tragic events at RedLake. Earlier last month, I visited the Red Lake Chippewa Res-ervation in Minnesota and witnessed first-hand the results of thedevastation brought about by the shootings at the Red Lake HighSchool. I also saw the community uniting and drawing strength from the support of mental health professionals and tribal spiritual leaders.In the midst of the trauma and upheaval that was caused by theshootings, there is still a sense of hope an a spirit of collaborationamong the community, the tribal leaders, and State and Federalprograms.4 The IHS is working closely with the Substance Abuse and Men- tal Health Services Administration, the Administration for Chil-dren and Families, the Administration for Native Americans andthe Office of Minority Health to bring the resources of the Depart-ment to bear on that tribe and the tragedy that just recently oc-curred. The question that we need to ask is how do we preventsuch incidents from occurring in the first place. First, the IndianHealth Service is focusing on screening and primary prevention inour mental health programs, especially for depression, which mani-fests itself in suicide, domestic violence and addictions. Second, we focus on the effective utilization of treatment modali- ties that are available, and we are seeking to improve the docu-mentation of mental health problems. IHS is currently utilizing ef-fective tools for documentation to the behavioral health softwarepackage. We work with communities who are focusing more onthese mental health needs. With about 80 percent of the mentalhealth budget and about 97 percent of our alcohol and substanceabuse budget from the Indian Health Service going directly totribes operating their own programs, now the tribes and commu-nities themselves are taking responsibility for their own healing. Suicide is not a single problem, but rather is a single response to multiple problems. Neither is it strictly a clinical nor an individ-ual problem, but one that affects and is affected by entire commu-nities. Quoting from the Institute of Medicine's landmark 2002publication, Reducing Suicide: Suicide may have a basis in depression or substance abuse, but it simultaneously may relate to social factors like community breakdown, loss of key social relations,economic depression or political violence. This is particularly true in Indian country. To address it appro- priately requires public health and community interventions asmuch as direct clinical ones. In late September 2003, I announced the IHS National Suicide Prevention Initiative. It is designed to directly support the IndianHealth Service Tribal and Urban programs in three major areas as-sociated with suicide in our communities. First, to mobilize tribesand tribal programs to address suicide in a systematic, evidence-based manner; second, to expand and enrich research and programbases; and third, to support and promote programmatic collabora-tions on suicide prevention. Over the last 1 12years, a substantial progress has been made to developing plans and programs, but it is only the beginning ofwhat must be a long-term, concerted and coordinated effort amongFederal, tribal, State, and local community agencies to address thecrisis. The initiative addresses all 11 goals of the National Strategyfor Suicide Prevention. It also extends or enhances work betweentribal communities, local, State, and Federal agencies and noweven includes the greater tribal indigenous populations of NorthAmerican through our ongoing partnerships with Health Canadaand First Nations Inuit Health Branch. Let me summarize briefly some of the efforts we have taken in each of the three major areas. As over 80 percent of the IHS men-tal health budget goes directly to tribes, it is clear that tribes, notIHS, are now primarily providing services to their communities.IHS now seeks to support those direct services with programs and5 program collaborations to bring resources and methodologies to the communities themselves. The IHS National Suicide Prevention Committee was empaneled in February 2004 to help guide the overall IHS tribal effort. Com-posed of primarily tribal behavioral health professionals fromacross the country, it served not only to assist in providing direc-tion for efforts, but also to provide representative membership insome of the specific programs that have been developed. IHS is cur-rently working with our areas, our tribal communities and Statesto establish area-wide suicide surveillance and prevention systems,in collaboration with the BIA and States to collect information fromlaw enforcement and medical examiner data bases. This will sup-plement our IHS behavioral health management software, to beable to gather information from tribal and IHS communities. We are strengthening the partnerships between State and Fed- eral representatives in the area of suicide prevention. We have IHSrepresentatives who are now members of State suicide preventionteams and coalitions in many States throughout the country to en-sure that American Indian and Alaska Natives are providing accessto State services. We have participated in work groups to improvesuicide prevention and intervention activities and provided out-reach to attempters, families, and communities. We have also begun to train laypersons from the community in a program called QPR, Question, Persuade and Refer, to act asgatekeepers. We have involved American Indian and Alaska Nativeyouth in suicide prevention efforts, primarily through school pro-grams and curriculums and Boys and Girls Clubs. We have pro-vided workshops and forums on suicide prevention and one IHSarea, the Aberdeen area, has a QPR initiative to assure competencyfor non-mental health providers to identify and respond appro-priately to suicidal behaviors. Research into suicide in Indian country is limited, and what re- search is available suggests that suicide in our communities differsin substantial ways from other racial and ethnic groups, suggestingyounger and more impulsive suicide attempts than other popu-lations. To that end, IHS is collaborating with the National Insti-tute of Mental Health, Health Canada, and the Canadian Institutefor Health Research on a multi-year effort to better understand sui-cide in Indian country and to develop evidence-based interventionsfor prevention. Staff from those agencies have been working forover 1 year to develop this initiative, and its first internationalmeeting will be held this September in Albuquerque, NM. The pur-pose is to bring together researchers, clinicians, program personnel,wisdom keepers, and governmental representatives from NorthAmerica to begin a 5-year interagency, and indeed, internationaleffort, to develop a concrete research agenda and to develop specificprograms for our indigenous populations. Finally, SAMHSA and Indian Health Service have created a na- tional suicide prevention intervention team for Indian country.Composed of one person from each IHS Area, these personnel arecurrently being trained in community suicide prevention and mobi-lization. Once trained, they will be able to, in turn, train personnelin tribal communities to provide suicide prevention programming,including materials, techniques, and protocols. Training should be6 completed by summer and the team members will be ready to begin supporting communities at that time. This will also be amulti-year collaboration which we hope to expand as resourcesallow. In summary, I think we are engaged in a battle for hope. For those young people who see only poverty, social and physical isola-tion, lack of opportunity, or familial dissolution, hope can be lostand self destructive behavior becomes a natural consequence. Theinitiative and programs I have described are some of the methodsand means to restore that hope and engage youth and their com-munities to sustain and nurture. While they might not be sufficientchange many peoples' living conditions, we can by working to-gether, among Federal agencies, branches of government, tribes,States, and the local communities, turn the tide to restore hope toour youth. To that end, I commit to work with you and the commit-tee, as well as others, to bring services and resources to that effort. Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement. Thank you for this opportunity to discuss what the IHS and tribal programs are doingto help the impact of suicide in our communities. Senator D ORGAN . Dr. Grim, thank you very much for your testi- mony. Next we will hear from Ulonda Shamwell, of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Ulonda, whydon't you proceed. STATEMENT OF ULONDA SHAMWELL, M.S.W., DIVISION DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF POLICY, PLANNING AND BUDGET,SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMIN-ISTRATION; ACCOMPANIED BY DENISE MIDDLEBROOK,PUBLIC HEALTH ANALYST Ms. S HAMWELL . Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. I am Ulonda Shamwell, from the Office of Policy,Planning and Budget at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, within the Department of Health andHuman Services. I am pleased to offer testimony this morning onbehalf of A. Katharine Power, Director of SAMHSA's Center forMental Health Services, CMHS. Ms. Power testified before thiscommittee on April 13, 2005, about suicide and violence amongAmerican Indians and Alaska Natives. Unfortunately, she was un-able to testify today, but sends her regards. Accompanying me today is my colleague, Dr. Denise Middle- brook, Social Science Analyst, who is available to answer questions. Mr. Chairman, before proceeding with my oral statement, I ask that my written testimony be included in the record. Thank you for the opportunity to describe how SAMSHA is work- ing to provide effective mental health and substance abuse treat-ment services along with substance abuse prevention and mentalhealth promotion services in Indian country. It is also a privilegeto testify along with Dr. Charles Grim, Director of Indian HealthService, this morning. SAMSHA and IHS have developed a strongpartnership, reflected in our current interagency agreement towork efficiently and effectively together to help meet the publichealth needs of American Indians and Alaska Natives.7 My testimony will focus on two issues of great concern for the public health of American Indian and Alaska Native youth. Thesetwo issues are suicide and violence. Sorrowfully, there are real-lifeexamples to illustrate the impact of suicide and violence in Indiancountry. Recently, a suicide cluster occurred on the Standing RockReservation in North and South Dakota. Ten young people tooktheir own lives and dozens of other attempted to do so. More youngpeople are continuing to do so. Tragically, many other reservations have similar stories to tell. Suicide is now the second leading cause of death, behind uninten-tional injury and accidents, for American Indian and Alaska Nativeyouth ages 15-24. The suicide rate for this population is 2 12times higher than the national average. American Indians have the high-est rate of suicide among all ethnic groups in the United States,with a rate of 14.8 per 100,000, as reported in 1998. Rates arehighest in the northern plains, Pacific Northwest and Alaska areas,five to seven times higher than the overall U.S. rate. More thanone-half of all persons who commit suicide in Indian country havenever been seen by a mental health provider. In studies that examine risk factors among people who have com- pleted suicide, substance abuse occurs more frequently amongyouth and younger adults, compared to older adults. For particulargroups at risk, such as American Indians and Alaska Natives, de-pression and Substance abuse are the most common risk factors forcompleted suicide. Mental health and substance abuse disordersare also risk factors for violence. According to the National Center for Injury and Prevention Con- trol within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, injuriesand violence account for 75 percent of all deaths among NativeAmericans ages 1-19. As I mentioned earlier, suicide is the secondleading cause of death for Indian youth ages 15-24, followed byhomicide, the third leading cause of death for the same age group. A recent example of violence in Indian country is the tragedy at Red Lake. A 16 year old junior at the Red Lake High School onthe Red Lake Reservation in Minnesota took the lives of 9 othersand then his own on March 21, 2005. The 16 year old shot andkilled his grandfather, his grandfather's partner, 5 students, ateacher, security office, and himself. Since this event, there havebeen 2 more confirmed suicides and a number of attempts. The statistical picture on the Red Lake Reservation, home to about 5,000 tribal members, is well below the national average andbelow that of many other reservations. Red Lake Nation is an im-poverished community; 39 percent of the population lives below thepoverty line. Four out of five students at Red Lake High Schoolqualify for free or reduced fee lunch. One-third of the teenagers onthe reservation are not in school, not working and not looking forwork, compared to that of about 20 percent of all reservations. A survey last year by the Minnesota Department of Health and Education found that young people on the Red Lake Reservationare far more likely to think about suicide, be depressed, worryabout drugs and be violent with one another than children acrossthe State. A State survey of 9th graders found that at Red LakeHigh, 43 percent of the boys and 82 percent of the girls hadthoughts about suicide, with 20 percent of the boys and 48 percent8 of the girls saying that they had tried it at least once. This event has led to community trauma and turmoil. Unfortunately, this con-dition is repeated on reservations across the Nation. SAMHSA focuses attention, programs and funding on improving the lives of people with or at risk for mental and substance abusedisorders. Consistent with President Bush's new Freedom Initia-tive, SAMHSA's vision is a life in the community for everyone. Theagency is achieving that vision through the mission, building resil-ience and facilitating recovery. SAMHSA's direction and policy pro-gram and budget is guided by a matrix of priority programs andcross-cutting principles that include the related issues of culturalcompetency and eliminating disparities. To achieve the agency's vision and mission for all Americans, SAMHSA-supported services are provided within the most relevantand meaningful cultural, gender-sensitive and age-appropriate con-text for people being served. SAMSHA has put this understandinginto action for American Indian and Alaska Native communitiesthat it serves. It is important to note also that it is SAMSHA Ad-ministrator Charles Curry's policy to level the playing field and toensure that tribal entities are eligible for all competitive grants forwhich States are eligible, unless there is a compelling reason to thecontrary. In total, SAMHSA provides about $42 million to American Indian and Alaska Natives annually. SAMHSA's Center for Mental HealthServices is transferring $200,000 to IHS to support programmingand service contracts, technical assistance and related services forsuicide cluster response and suicide prevention among AmericanIndians and Alaska Natives. One example is the development of acommunity suicide prevention tool kit. This tool kit will include in-formation on suicide prevention, education, screening, interventionand community mobilization, which could be readily available toAmerican Indian and Alaska Native communities via the web orother digitally-based media for off-the-shelf use. To better assist tribal organizations, SAMSHA funded a $1-mil- lion grant that was awarded to the Oregon Health and ScienceUniversity to establish the One Sky Center, an American Indianand Alaska Native national resource center. The One Sky Centerprovides technical assistance, training, information disseminationand communication to increase substance abuse prevention andtreatment knowledge and skills among service providers, policymakers, tribal communities, funding organizations and consumers. Today, the One Sky Center is a national resource center that, in addition to its many other services, maintains a comprehensive listof American Indian and Alaska Native programs that are currentlyfunded by SAMSHA. The One Sky Center is currently providingtechnical assistance to Standing Rock community by providingthem with assistance and requesting SAMHSA's emergency re-sponse grant for immediate and intermediate emergency funds. SAMSHA also collaborates with IHS and the National Institute of Mental Health within the National Institutes of Health on theCircles of Care grant program. The Circles of Care grant programsupports the implementation of mental health service models de-signed by American Indian and Alaska Native tribal and urban In-dian communities that utilize a system of care, community-based9 approach to mental health and other supportive services for Amer- ican Indian and Alaska Native children with serious emotional dis-turbances and their families. SAMHSA's Community Mental Health Services for Children and Their Families grant program provides funding for direct Servicesto improve systems of care for children and adolescents with seri-ous emotional disturbances and their families. Seven tribal organi-zations are among the current 63 grantees. Additionally, SAMSHA, under the authority of the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act, has announced funding in 2005 for two pro-grams. The first is the cooperative agreements for State-tribalsponsored youth suicide prevention and early intervention pro-grams, which will provide $5.5 million for 14 awards, with a mini-mum of one award that will be made to an American Indian orAlaska Native Tribe, tribal organization or urban Indian organiza-tion. Second is the campus suicide prevention grants, that will pro-vide $1.5 million for 20 awards. The receipt dates for both of theseawards is June 1. SAMHSA also has an announcement for a cooperative agreement for suicide prevention resource center grant that provides $2.6 mil-lion annually for up to 5 years. The receipt date is also June 1. SAMHSA takes seriously the current challenge in Indian coun- try, which includes few trained service providers, major transpor-tation barriers and multi-generational poverty. SAMHSA is beingproactive in addressing these challenges that rob communities oftheir most valuable resource: Their children and their future. Thevital treatment and prevention efforts that I have discussed todayare designed to address these problems and are improving servicesfor American Indian and Alaska Native children, youth and theirfamilies. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, thank you for this opportunity to appear today. I will be pleased to answer any ques-tions you may have. [Prepared statement of Ms. Shamwell appears in appendix.]Senator D ORGAN . Ms. Shamwell, thank you very much. Let me ask a few questions. I do want to introduce tribal leaders who are here, let me do that following this panel to introduce whois with us, the elected tribal leaders. Let me ask Dr. Grim and Ms.Shamwell, both of you are talking about grant programs and toolkits and a wide range of issues. In addition, you describe interven-tion teams. Can you tell me the nature of these intervention teams,the size of the teams, who is putting them together, when are theyavailable? What kinds of uses are being made of these interventionteams? Mr. G RIM. I'll start out, and then I will ask if Dr. Perez has any- thing to add on. In the last several years, when we have had sui-cide clusters that occur in communities, what we have done is sendin a team of mental health specialists and/or social workers. Theycome in and they essentially search capacity, give the community search capacity in mental health for the current crisis that is occur-ring. They go in and work with the community in a variety of ways.For example, they would set up centners in the hospital or the clin-ic in the town, they would set up centers, perhaps in other commu-10 nities within the reservation, if there are multiple communities, to allow people to just walk in and get that sort of assistance. More recently, in the Red Lake crisis that occurred, we sent teams out into the community, actually to go home to home, be-cause people did not want to come out to the centers and speak,but they wanted to speak at home with their families all present.So we started doing that. One of the things that the QPR conceptworks under, or one of the background philosophies, is that peoplethat need the counseling or need help that are considering suicidewill not often go to a place that is going to give them help and tryto talk them out of it if they are very seriously considering it. So they worked with the Red Lake community members in that concept, to help make more people aware of the signs and symp-toms. The size of the team varies along with the size of the commu-nity. We try to put together a team of sufficient size to address theissues. We will send them in for a couple of weeks to a couple ofmonths, depending on the nature of the crisis and how many peo-ple are using those teams. We try to leave behind any informationand any sorts of tool kits or other advice to the communities. Senator D ORGAN . Dr. Perez, do you have anything to add to that? Mr. P EREZ . The only thing that I would add is, the teams are in- vited or requested. It is not something that we are going to imme-diately send in without being invited. There are lots of places, lotsof communities that really much prefer to respond to their criseson their own. But it is a service that is available for them, at theirrequest. Senator D ORGAN . Isn't it the case that we are pretty dramatically underfunded in a lot of these areas? The reason I ask that questionis, and when I talked to you about the Avis Little Wind case, onetrained psychologist, I believe, and Ms. Shamwell, you mentionedtransportation at the end of your testimony. In the circumstanceswhere you go talk to these folks, they say, we are just dramaticallyunderstaffed, we do not have the transportation capabilities tomove a child some place where they need to be moved to get thehelp. So when you take a look at the whole system, it appears tome that we just don't have the resources out there. I told you, Dr. Grim, during the testimony that you provided to our committee in Washington, we have responsibilities for healthcare for Federal prisoners. Then we have trust responsibility forhealth care for American Indians. We are talking here about men-tal health. We spend exactly twice as much money per capita pro-viding health care to Federal prisoners as we do meeting our trustresponsibility to provide health care for Native Americans. Isn't it the case that when you look at this with the transpor- tation, trained professionals and so on, in most cases with mostreservations, we do not have the resources? Would you agree withthat, Dr. Grim? Mr. G RIM. I think that over the last decade, that people have come to accept mental health treatment more and more in thiscountry as a whole, not only in our population. So many of ourmental health programs, while they may have been satisfactory anumber of years ago, when mental health treatment was notsought as often, I think now many of our programs are working atfull steam, they have having triaged care, they are dealing only11 with some of the most urgent cases. And certainly when a suicide cluster begins to appear in a community, I would hesitate to guess,but I doubt any of our facilities are sufficiently staffed to deal witha suicide cluster crisis when it occurs, which is why we have triedto develop some team search capacity to allow a community to havethat help if they so desire. Senator D ORGAN . Ms. Shamwell. Ms. S HAMWELL . I would defer to Dr. Middlebrook. Senator D ORGAN . Dr. Middlebrook. Mr. M IDDLEBROOK . On the SAMHSA side of work that we have been doing here with Standing Rock, we deployed myself and Dr.Gale Walker from One Sky Center, it was a couple of months ago,I think it was, 2 or 3 months ago, we came in and conducted needsassessment with the community members. We identified key com-munity members and worked with local IHS folks to determine theextent of the problems, what the needs were for the community,what types of follow-up were done following the suicides. We clearly heard the issue of transportation as being one of them, the issue of inability, with great distances between the eightcommunities on the reservation, the inability to really provide ade-quate follow-up because of the extent of the crisis and the numberof people involved, with very few human resources in order to dothe follow-up. We also heard needs around safe housing for kids, places for kids to go when they felt that they could not go home, when they wereat risk. And so Dr. Walker developed a resource book and a com-plete report that he put together for us, that definitely outlines theissues and has recommendations in it. We could certainly makethat available to you. Senator D ORGAN . What I would like to get from the Indian Health Service and perhaps your organization, Ms. Shamwell, Iwould like to get a description of the resources available on eachreservation. Because early prevention is what is going to save liveshere. If a young child is missing 90 days of school, lying in bed ina fetal position, in desperate condition, somebody needs to be avail-able to provide help. There needs to be early warning to deal withthese circumstances. At least my cursory observation is, the re-sources by and large on a day to day basis, forgetting about clus-ters here, on a day to day basis, the resources are horribly inad-equate to deal with the problem. So Dr. Grim, could I have your staff get for me some kind of analysis of what kinds of mental health services are available res-ervation by reservation? Mr. G RIM. Yes; I can do that, and I also want to thank you and let the people here know that Senator Dorgan helped us get someadditional money to deal with the Standing Rock crisis. We verymuch appreciated that. Senator D ORGAN . I think tool kits, intervention teams, all these things are hopeful I think, and helpful in addressing what is the problem. But I think I also need to understand, what are the largersets of resources available. Mr. G RIM. We can do that. Senator D ORGAN . Let me call on Congressman Pomeroy.12 Mr. P OMEROY . Thank you for your testimony. One thing that dis- turbs me a little is that I'm not hearing the level of urgency thatI think the situation deserves. Maybe it is simply the form of testi-mony, but there are things in each of your statements that I finda little troubling. Candid, but troubling. I find Dr. Grim, on page 6 of your testimony, research into sui- cide in Indian Country is limited, but research is available to sug-gest suicide in our communities differs in substantial ways fromother racial and ethnic groups. Then you talk about a collaborativeeffort that is leading to a 5-year study, the first conference to beheld in September. It seems as though, given the statistics thatshow suicide is particularly problematic for this population, if wedon't really understand it, we ought to have perhaps an acceleratedeffort beyond what the statement would reflect. And as to SAMHSA's response, Ms. Shamwell, I am trying to fig- ure out from the statistics you provided here: You provide $42 mil-lion to American Indians and Alaska Natives generally, but youthen indicate $200,000 has been provided in support of program-ming and services to deal with suicide cluster response and suicideprevention. This also seems perhaps not proportionate to the prob-lem, as revealed in the statistics. I want to make sure I am fairhere, so I would like to hear from each of you concerning what theurgency is within your agency in responding to this crisis, andwhether or not there is more Congress needs to do? I don't carewhat the Administration's budget calls for. What else does Con-gress need to do to get you the resources you need to make the re-sponse you would like to make? Dr. Grim.Mr. G RIM. I think that any of our people that work on the ground in our hospitals and clinics realize the crisis level of the situation.There has been substantial progress in the last 1 12years to 2 years of dealing within our programs and tribal programs on acommunity-wide basis. But also, some of the things we talkedabout in the testimonies are also looking at a long-term concertedeffort and we are trying to coordinate multiple groups of agencies.The Indian Health Service and SAMSHA are working closely al-ready, but our National Institutes of Mental Health and our coun-terparts in Canada are working with us also. So we are looking ata more long-term research based program. We are already beginning to put through the One Sky Center, through our Division of Behavioral Health and in concert withSAMSHA a lot of effort into suicide prevention in Indian country.We are trying to address goals that have been laid out in the na-tional strategy for suicide prevention for our communities, and wehave tried to make sure that each one of those issues are being ad-dressed. So it is going to take a little bit of a long-term effort, be-cause as I said, it is not really just a clinical problem with an indi-vidual. That is the end point of a whole host of multi-factorialissues that are not really just health related within the community.There are social and economic issues, educational issues and thingslike that. Getting all those groups to work together within one com-munity sometimes is difficult. That is why we are looking at it, werealize there is a crisis, but we are looking at it as a long-term ef-fort that we are going to have to systematically approach.13 Ms. S HAMWELL . Actually, the $42 million represents all of the ac- tivities that we have in Indian country and in tribal communities.Some of them are treatment, some of them are prevention, someof them are mental health focused, some of them are substanceabuse focused. But really, we see all of them as part of the continuum. The $200,000 that you mentioned is just one activity that addresses sui-cide. We have several others that I talked about also that arebrand new, that we actually have announced on the street rightnow, which we are very excited about. What we are hoping to do, though, pretty much along the lines that Dr. Middlebrook spoke about, we are trying to assess what ishampering so that we have a long-term plan, but we also haveshort-term response where we not only send people directly whenthere is a tragedy, but we also have these new funds that are avail-able that we are very excited about and eager to get out into thecommunities. Mr. P OMEROY . Thank you both. Senator D ORGAN . I want to thank both of you for testifying. I hope and expect that you are going to be able to stay for the re-mainder of the hearing. I want you to hear the remaining testi-mony. But I appreciate the fact that both of you have traveled some dis- tance. I think Congressman Pomeroy's question is a question thatwe continue to ask: Does everyone understand the urgency. So thank you very much for being here, Dr. Middlebrook, Dr. Perez, Dr. Grim, and Ms. Shamwell. Let me say that when we began to put this hearing together, we contacted Gene LaFrambois, who is the Superintendent of theschool in Fort Yates. He indicated that he really felt we shouldhave some students testify. Tim Krehler, the vice principal at theStanding Rock School, helped us arrange that. I am going to invertthe second and third panels. Let me just say to you, we have Dr.Doug McDonald, director of the Indians Into Psychology Programfrom the University of North Dakota with us; Dr. Paul Dauphinais,the school psychologist at Turtle Mountain Schools; and CynthiaLindquest-Mala, the president of the Community College in FortTotten. They are going to be our third panel. I am going to invertthe panels and ask the second panel to come forward, which isMichelle Fast Horse, who is a senior at the Standing Rock Commu-nity Schools; Vaquita Hines, a junior at the Standing Rock Commu-nity Schools; and Elena Eagle Shield, a freshman at the StandingRock Community Schools. They have all expressed an interest intestifying, and let me thank again the recommendation from Super-intendent LaFrambois, and also Mr. Krehler. Thank you for mak-ing them available as well, and helping them attend. Also on this panel Doreen Yellow Bird. Doreen Yellow Bird is a journalist and a family member and a member of the Arikara Na-tion. Doreen has written on this subject in her professional life. Before I ask the panel to present, I would like to acknowledge some tribal leaders who are among us today. Charles Murphy, thechairman of the Standing Rock Tribe. Chairman Ken Davis, TurtleMountain Band of Chippewa. Dontino White, chairman of the Spir-it Lake Tribe. Thank you.14 Mike Peters, Secretary of the Sisseton-Wapeton Sioux Tribe. Mike is in the back over there. We have Cheryl Coulas, executivedirector of the North Dakota Indian Affairs Commission with us.And finally, we have Deborah Hall Thompson, who is here rep-resenting Chairman Hall of the Three Affiliated Tribes. Deborah,thank you very much for being here. I want to thank all of you for participating and thank you for your leadership with the respective tribes. Let me thank this panel for being here, thanks to the students especially. And let me begin by calling on Doreen Yellow Bird. Do-reen, if you would begin and then we will hear from the students.Thank you very much for the work that you do, Doreen. STATEMENT OF DOREEN YELLOW BIRD, JOURNALIST AND FAMILY MEMBER, MEMBER, ARIKARA NATION Ms. Y ELLOW BIRD. Thank you very much, Senator Dorgan and Congressman Pomeroy for being here. My name is Doreen YellowBird. I am Sahnish from the Three Affiliated Tribes and in WhiteShield. I am also a journalist and a writer with the Grand ForksHerald, and I am also the aunt of two nephews who have commit-ted suicide and a niece who has made an attempt. A couple of months ago, I was at the Standing Rock Reservation doing interviews with students and people who were parents of oras students who were involved in suicide. It was an experience thatjust breaks your heart, to see the young people, our children, leav-ing us in this manner. I spoke to a woman who had lost her son,and I could see the sorrow on her face that again was heart-breaking, as she told me that she would never, ever get over theloss of her child, and that she would take this loss to her death.She said she would always remember that. I talked to some of the students who were affected and who felt what was going on. They were frightened by it. I talked to peopleon the reservation who said that they are also frightened, becausethere didn't seem to be a pattern, it was not a certain group of chil-dren, it was not young people, it was not teens who did poorly inschool or who used drugs and alcohol. There was a whole list ofchildren, there were more women, more young women than youngmen, which was a pattern years ago. So there was a fear amongthe people. So 2 or 3 weeks later, I was working at the Grand Forks Herald. About 3:30, we got a call from Red Lake and we were up to RedLake within 1 12hours. I was there for the next 2 days and in- volved in the killing and the suicide there. The awful sorrow andsadness and fright that you feel is almost, it was almost over-whelming to see some of the women wailing for their children. Icould only take it so long and I had to come back to the Heraldand I did my work from there. But more tragic to me was the loss just recently of my nephew. I talked with my aunt, who is one of the bundle keepers of theSahnish, our people. This is her grandchild. The children's motheris her sister, and she passed away, so my aunt is now her motherand this is her grandchild. She was really stunned by the suicide,because this was the second one in that family. She told me to tellthem that in our way, in the Sahnish way, that they should not15 have the wake and the giveaway kind of thing, that they should bury the child in a good way, but that they should not give praise to it, because she said that she is in her eighties and she has livedwith diabetes for 49 years. She has had several heart attacks, shehas ulcers, she has a whole gamut of diseases that go along withdiabetes. And she now has arthritis, so she lives in pain and thatkind of thing continuously. But she said that our Creator says thatlife is a precious gift, and she said we must make sure that ourchildren understand that, that they know that life is a gift that youdon't let it go so easily. She said that, Doreen, I don't think that these kids, these chil- dren, my grandchildren understand what dead is. That is our role,she said, as elders and as parents, to teach them. She said, we'renot doing that, we need to go back and we need to help them. Shecried. I know that she does not understand all of what is going on. My aunt does not know that methamphetamine is a powerful thing onthe reservation. She does not know that some of her other grand-children are involved with that. Their mother said that they wereafraid that they were at risk, because they have real highs frommeth, and then when they come off meth, they're suicidal. So theyare concerned, meth is a huge problem in North Dakota and on res-ervations. As I talked to some of the people about suicide, they alsomentioned that their children were involved with meth. Alcohol is also a depressant. So if you are using alcohol, you are also at risk, as the people from IHS also said. So I tried to explain some of these things to her, and she said that, Doreen, one of the things you need to do is when you get outand you talk to people, when you talk to elders, when you talk tospiritual leaders, she said, ask them to pray for our children. Shesaid, they are our most precious thing. They carry the vessel of ourancestors in them. We need to continue on. So she said, tell them that. She said, tell them to take care of their children and ask they to pray, pray for their children, prayfor our children. Thank you for allowing me to speak.Senator D ORGAN . Doreen, thank you very much. I appreciate your being here. Michelle Fast Horse, Vaquita Hines, and Elena Eagle Shield, at your age I had great difficulty speaking to three people at once, letalone a crowded room. But I really appreciate your school rec-ommending you and your willingness to share with us today. Letme ask you to begin, Michelle. You are a senior in high school. Whydon't you provide us whatever thoughts you have? If you would pullthat microphone close while you speak, we would appreciate it. Andagain, thank you very much for being with us, Michelle. STATEMENT OF MICHELLE FAST HORSE, SENIOR, STANDING ROCK COMMUNITY SCHOOL Ms. F AST HORSE . Honorable Vice Chairman Dorgan and other members of the Committee on Indian Affairs, [greeting in nativetongue]. My name is Michelle Fast Horse. I am a senior in theStanding Rock Community School. I will be graduating May 29.16 I live in Cannonball, ND, and I have for my entire life. I have been asked to testify to your committee regarding the suicides onthe Standing Rock Reservation. I am humbled to represent the youth of Standing Rock. I do not speak for all youth, but I am only expressing my personal opinions.I believe suicide is a great mystery. There is no way suicide canbe predicted. The only way to tell if someone is going to commitsuicide is when they actually tell you that they are. Teenagers andyoung adults make up a majority of the Nation's suicides. I thinkbecause we teens are very confused about life and have a lot ofstress on pressure on us, we become depressed. Some teenagershave absolutely no trust in anyone, due to the fact that no one isthere for them to talk to. That is probably why they don't talk tocounselors and get help. Something that can be hard in a teen's life are boyfriends or girlfriends that break up with them, because sometimes that'spractically their only friend or the only person they trust. Manyteens go through physical or emotional abuse at home and theyoften don't know how to cope with all those bad feelings, so theypossibly turn to suicide. Sometimes teens tend to suicide becauseof drugs and alcohol or while they are under the influence of drugsand alcohol. I personally lost a friend to suicide while she was under the in- fluence and she had, after she had died, we found out that she wasbeing abused. Two of my other friends came to me while they wereunder the influence of alcohol and they wanted me to help them,because they did not want to live any more, they wanted to commitsuicide. They believed that nobody loved them. Depression among teenagers can be a cause for many things that happen, from early childhood, being either neglected or abused, be-cause of living in poverty or having parents that abuse drugs or al-cohol. There are many ways that adults can help teens. Creating more community awareness on suicide I think is really needed, especiallyin my community. Teenagers need places where they can hang out,such as arcades and gyms and skate parks, because where I livethere really is nothing. Some teens should be able to have like asafe house, in case something, if something is going on at home andthey want to go somewhere and they have nowhere to go, they cango to a safe house, if there was one. Teenagers become depressed because they, some of them do not know what to do after high school. There are people that can helpin our schools. They can help them apply for college and help themwith their financial aid. That would really work. That would helpthem so they can become more educated and get greater jobs andprevent the poverty in our communities. In closing, I believe suicide is very controversial, and I believe there are many ways to prevent it, starting with people that arejust wiling to volunteer and listen. Thank you. Senator D ORGAN . Michelle, thank you very much. We appreciate your being here and sharing with us. Next, Vaquita Hines is a junior at the Standing Rock School. Vaquita?17 STATEMENT OF VAQUITA HINES, JUNIOR, STANDING ROCK COMMUNITY SCHOOL Ms. H INES. Honorable Chairman McCain, Honorable Vice Chair- man Dorgan and Honorable Senators of the Committee on IndianAffairs, hello, my name is Vaquita Hines. I am a junior at theStanding Rock Community School. I live in rural Fort Yates. I recently returned to live in the Fort Yates community and this is my second year of attending Standing Rock High School. I am also humbled to represent the youth of Standing Rock. As Michelle said, I am only here to express my opinions and how Ifeel. I cannot speak for the rest of the youth on Standing Rock. When someone commits suicide, the questions that first come to mind are why, what, how. There are many questions and they allcan't be answered. No one knows the real reason why someone chooses to commit suicide. It could be stress, financial problems,sexual or physical abuse, emotional abuse, school, peers. A big fac-tor is drugs and alcohol. There are several factors that lead to sui-cide, and I could go on and on with a list of things. I really don't understand why anyone would want to take their life. Yes, there are going to be times in your life that are going tobe bad, and you are going to have your troubles. But you will getover them. I guarantee you things will become better. Everyonegoes through it all at one time in their life. I think the reason for some of the suicides on the Standing Rock Reservation is because there is nothing for the kids to do. Thereisn't very much school programs and activities to keep the kids oc-cupied and out of trouble. Also, it is not very difficult or hard toget alcohol in the hands of a teen, so there is an extremely highrate for underage drinking. Sometimes teens live in a rough household with no one to talk to or turn to, no mother, no father, no parental figure. They mighteven feel alone, as if no one loves or cares for them. The majorityof Standing Rock's population is kids and teenagers, so there needsto be something for them to do. There has been a lot of talk about having dorms. Of course, there are benefits and downfalls of having dorms. For one, there couldbe more kids attending school. Many kids leave Standing Rock togo to other boarding schools around the country. By having dorms,some would stay and other kids from different places could comeand stay in them, too. There could probably be a decrease in tardies and absences in school because the students would be close by. Dorms would makethe students feel safer and free from alcohol and drugs. Therewould also be qualified people around for them to talk to and kidsfor them to learn from and relate with. Some downfalls are, theywouldn't be with their immediate family members and theywouldn't have a parental figure to teach them their family historyand family values. There could be more after school programs. Wedo have some at Standing Rock, but there could be more schooldances, movie nights, game nights, plays, talkers, and even smallclubs such as a girls' group, guys' group, chess clubs. There aremany ideas that come to mind.18 Another idea is having a local teen crisis hot line that would be readily available by answering questions and listening to what youhave to tell them. Basically what I am trying to say is Standing Rock needs to get the youth involved. In some situations, the parents should be heldresponsible for some children's actions. For example, the parentsshould be involved as much as possible in the kid's life. Theyshould know what they're doing, when they are doing it and whothey are going to do what with. I myself grew up in many differentplaces, I am an Army brat. I have been everywhere. And I wasn'texposed to suicide until I moved to Standing Rock Reservation. Inever even thought about it, heard about anybody doing it, I nevereven witnessed it. Those are some of the things I feel could be done about the situa- tion, the action that needs to be taken. Don't just say you want todo something and never get it done. Don't give a bunch of, like sug-gestions, and never do it. Those are some of the things that could be done about this situa- tion. I would like to leave you with two notes. Why not love andlive life and make it better and make it happen? Thank you for lis-tening. Michelle and I will be more than happy to try and answerany of the questions you may have. Senator D ORGAN . Thank you very much, Vaquita. Next is Elena Eagle Shield. Elena is a freshman at the Standing Rock Community School. Elena, why don't you proceed? STATEMENT OF ELENA EAGLE SHIELD, FRESHMAN, STANDING ROCK COMMUNITY SCHOOL Ms. E AGLE SHIELD . Good morning. My name is Elena Eagle Shield, and I would like to thank you, Senator Dorgan and honoredguests, for offering me this opportunity to voice my opinion. Children need a system of well-rounded support. Children cry for help and need attention. Family and friends from far away, otherplaces, forgo events such as weddings, graduations, birthdays, an-niversaries, et cetera, but come running when there is a death. Idon't think it should have to be like that. We shouldn't have togather for grief or hard times. We should gather for celebrationsand happiness. Family plays a big role in children's outlook on life. We need someone to love us, to care enough to push us toward our goals andsay we can get a Ph.D or be a Senator or be the President of theUnited States. We need support for the big things. We need to rekindle cultural values, also, such as prayer, hon- esty, respect, generosity, wisdom and courage, which in return im-proves and strengthens family dynamics. Even simple things suchas having supper together, watching movies, doing homework, justletting children know that they are special and they are loved. I am confident that if parents were there and involved, teens would have that well-rounded support and not have to look for anactivity in alcohol and drugs, which plays a major part in suicideand fatalities and attempts. Therefore, we need extracurricular ac-tivities such as dance classes, cultural activities, karate lessons,gymnastics, other things like swimming pools, arcades and skateparks. We are so isolated, we just need diversional activities,19 things to look forward to, like trips to different places. We need to know that there is a big world out there, and there is a wide vari-ety of our outlook on life. Incentives for certain deeds, regardless of grade point averages or attendance. Because some kids do not have someone to pushthem toward getting good grades or wake them up in the morningto get them to school on time. Most of the time, the ones who needthese things, these incentives and trips the most, can't do it. We need more conferences, youth gatherings, not just one annual a year. We need to get the chance to speak amongst each other andlisten as well. Teens are already intervening with friends around a lot of issues as well as suicide, drugs and alcohol, sex, without adult knowledgeand support. We need to be able to talk to who we feel comfortablewith, regardless of whether they are a certified counselor or it'stheir job. If not, we need to get more certified counselors. We are learning more and getting involved, because we do under- stand that these issues are not only facing us now, but all over theworld, facing all kinds of teens and races. When there are problems with drugs and alcohol or an attempt or a gesture of suicide, we need help right now, not put it off untilnext week or even the next day. It needs to be dealt with rightaway, not put off because there is a waiting list or no money. Onething is we need more treatment centers. We have one treatmentcenter in our area, which holds a bed for one of our youth, the Ab-erdeen Area Regional Youth Treatment Center. Don't worry aboutwhat happened or what could have happened, worry about whatcould happen now, what we all could do to help, by working to-gether. We need more law enforcement officers who can come by and are truly interested in what is going on on the reservation and aboutthe youths' future. We also need to be our own support system. Wecan start off with positive friends, positive activities, caring adultswho really listen and want to have a say and listen to what wehave to say also. And again, values and beliefs. You say there is a shrine of suicide commiters and attempters. Don't you think that blanket is a sign that look, here are all thesesuiciders and look at all the empty spaces that need to be filled in?Why not a survivor's blanket for the ones who are helping andwant to help others get through things like this? I would like to say thank you for listening to us, to us youth. I know you want to hear what we have to say, but most adults won'tlisten, because that's all we are is youth, we don't have a Ph.D orother credentials behind our name. I believe you have already de-cided what you want to hear. In closing, another thought that came to me was if you are really concerned about the issues going on, on behalf of the youth I ex-tend an invitation to come to the Standing Rock Reservation andpersonally meet with and hear testimony with other youth, heart to heart, without any publicity. I would be pleased to answer any questions to the best of my ability. Thank you very much. Senator D ORGAN . Thank you very much.20 The three of you are very inspiring, and we appreciate your being here. Who are the folks who are standing? Parents? All right.Thank you very much for being here as well. Let me ask, and I will certainly accept your invitation, Elena, to come back to Standing Rock as well and have some meetings withthe youth at Standing Rock. I have met with classmates of thosewho have committed suicide. One of the things that some have saidis sometimes there is an early warning, sometimes there are sig-nals, sometimes it's clear who is having trouble. Then other timesit is not clear at all, it is just a complete surprise, just out of theblue. And you think, well, this is not someone who I ever wouldhave thought would have attempted suicide. Some say it goes to alcohol and drugs, among other things. There is a wide range of causes, as Dr. Grim suggested. But I think allof you mentioned alcohol. In a school system, at least the site youare familiar with, is it pretty obvious to students where you canobtain alcohol or where you can obtain drugs or from whom youcan obtain alcohol and drugs? Ms. E AGLE SHIELD . Yes; I think it's really easy. Anybody can just walk up to, even a cousin or auntie or uncle, who just wantsmoney, they'll help you get it, whenever you need it. Ms. H INES. There's also people that hang out outside the bars, and like young, 21 years old. A lot of people hang out with olderpeople and it is very easy. All you have to do is ask, and I guessyou'll receive. Senator D ORGAN . What kinds of resources exist at school for somebody who is troubled, let's say someone who is having a lot ofdifficulties in a lot of different areas and needs to reach out andtalk to somebody? What kind of counseling service is available atyour school? Ms. H INES. I think there are a lot of counselors, but a big prob- lem is that we had an issue in our school where someone talkedto a counselor and it wasn't confidential. Their information wasn'tjust with the counselor, and that kind of made a big old thing, peo-ple just don't feel safe by telling their business and just lettingtheir guts out to someone that they don't trust. But there are a lot of counselors that we can talk to, and a lot of our teachers. There are a lot of supporters, but there just needsto be more. Senator D ORGAN . You heard Doreen Yellow Bird talk about methamphetamine. As students, do you hear about methamphet-amine, hear people addicted to methamphetamine in the commu-nity? Is that a subject you're acquainted with at all? I don't meanpersonally. Ms. H INES. I don't hear a lot around the school. I don't really think there is a lot of students that use it around the school. Butof course, they are not going to say they use it. But I don't reallyhear a lot about methamphetamine users. I'm sure there are some. Senator D ORGAN . Doreen, let me ask, you were up at Red Lake and you have two nephews, you said, that took their own lives. Ms. Y ELLOW BIRD. Yes. Senator D ORGAN . Were both of the nephews involved with meth- amphetamine?21 Ms. Y ELLOW BIRD. No; not the one, the latest one actually was a big surprise. Most of the people, all the relatives were astoundedthat he committed suicide. There didn't seem to be any reason. Hewas doing well, and he just didn't seem to be a candidate for a sui-cide. It was a big surprise. And the other one was back in 1993. I am not sure if alcohol was involved. Senator D ORGAN . Congressman Pomeroy. Mr. P OMEROY . I want to thank this panel. I have heard a lot of panels at a lot of hearings, but I don't recall any being more rivet-ing than the words you brought us this morning. You were so ar-ticulate, so insightful, really very, very good. Doreen, you said something that is going to stick with me for a long time. You were quoting your friend when she said, ''I don'tthink our children understand what dead is.'' Would you elaborateon what your friend was trying to communicate? I have wonderedabout this relative to teen suicide, both on and off the reservations. Ms. Y ELLOW BIRD. It was my aunt, and she is the grandmother of the children who committed suicide. She was basing that on hermany years of experience and her experience with her many, manygrandchildren who are teens. It is a cultural thing, also, that whenyou are this age, you go through a point where you think you areimmune from death. You are not, you don't really understand thatdeath is forever and there is no turning around, that once you'regone, you're gone. There is also a cultural aspect of taking yourown life that's also Lakota-Dakota and that's also Sahnish, that Idon't know whether the young people know those things either. Mr. P OMEROY . I don't know if the students would have a com- ment on this one or not. Do you think it is fully appreciated bythose who consider suicide how completely irreversible, how forevera successful suicide is? Ms. E AGLE SHIELD . Yes; I recently had a cousin who committed suicide. Me and my family were talking and we don't think thatany temporary situation is such a, for a permanent cause\u2014I don'tknow how to put it. Ms. F AST HORSE . When there was a suicide, maybe before the last one, there was like a big commotion going on in the wholeschool where everybody was like, bring in these speakers, bring inthese speakers, talk about suicide and all that. They wanted to doso many things, they had all these ideas and I haven't seen any-thing happen so far. It was like, maybe March or so. And every-body was, why don't people do anything if they feel so stronglyabout it? It just dies out, all the activities they have in mind justdies out. Ms. H INES. I'd like to add something, it's just something that was really interesting that my tribal government class was talkingabout. When someone commits suicide, it's like they have, it's kindof like it's a big old, how can I explain this? When someone com-mits suicide, they celebrate it differently, they have memorials andtournaments and all that stuff for them. That's all good and stuff,but I'm just saying, who wouldn't want to have all that when youpass away? It's just that it shouldn't be celebrated so much when someone commits suicide, like that was the thing, we all in our school had22 to sign a big card when one of our peers had passed away and I heard someone say, oh, I wish someone, they all do this when Ipass away, I heard a sophomore say that. I was like, whoa, that'snot the message that we are trying to send. When someone passesaway, everyone comes, a lot of people celebrate it and stuff likethat. It shouldn't be celebrated. A lot of people look at it differentlike that. It shouldn't be celebrated, I don't think. Mr. P OMEROY . Thank you. Very interesting answers. Senator D ORGAN . You raised the question that I think Ms. Eagle Shield raised a bit, about is it appropriate to talk about this pub-licly even. Part of my passion is, I lost a wonderful daughter, toheart surgery, not to suicide. But I know the tragedy of losing achild. That tragedy is simply magnified by suicide for those parentsand those families who have experienced that. It is happening fartoo often. It is just such an enormous tragedy. Elena, at the end of your testimony you raised the question that I have thought a lot about. I held a meeting at the United TribesTechnical Center with about 40 or 50 people, a non-public meeting,we didn't exclude anybody, we just didn't invite anybody exceptthose that we wanted there to talk about this. The question is al-ways, for those of us on this committee, for example, not just onsuicide but other issues as well, what is the appropriateness ofhaving a hearing that will obviously generate attention? Is thatpositive or is it negative? The alterative to that is to simply allow what is happening to continue and say nothing, because we are worried that sayingsomething will generate publicity. The fact is, I think the only waywe are going to address this issue of teen suicide is to look itsquare in the eyes and say, here's what's happening, it is a tragedyof enormous proportions and we must address it honestly. And yes,that is hard to do. And yes, it will cause some people some pain,just to address it. But we really don't have any choice. When young people whose souls are tormented sufficiently that they believe they have to taketheir life, there is something dreadfully wrong. We must try inevery way possible, as parents, as citizens, as loved ones of thosewho are taking their lives, we must find a way to address it. So I think your testimony is really very helpful to us. I appre- ciate very much, Mr. Krehler, thank you for bringing your stu-dents. It was very important, when Sara Garland was helping putthis hearing together, I said, I don't want to push students into tes-tifying at a hearing like this. But my understanding was that youwanted to come and talk about this issue. I think it is helpful tohave you here. So we thank the three of you, and Doreen, thank you for what you write and what you think and what you share with us on theseand many issues. Thank you for being with us today. We appre-ciate it very much. The next panel that we will hear from is Dr. Doug McDonald, who is the director of Indians Into Psychology at the University ofNorth Dakota; Dr. Paul Dauphinais, a School Psychologist at theTurtle Mountain Schools; and Cynthia Lindquest-Mala, the presi-dent at the Community College at Fort Totten. If you would please23 come forward, we would very much appreciate your testimony as well. Mr. P OMEROY . Senator Dorgan, as we had previously discussed, I do have a prior commitment, a speaking engagement. So I haveto leave before the third panel can present. Because I know thethird panel, I want to express my appreciation for them bringingtheir experience forward, and adding their comments into therecord. Again, I want to thank you, Senator, for allowing me to partici- pate. I appreciate very much your being here. Senator D ORGAN . Congressman Pomeroy has been a very strong voice in the U.S. House of Representatives on many, many issues,including issues affecting Native Americans. We appreciate yourinterest and willingness to be here. Thank you very much. [Applause.]Senator D ORGAN . Let us start with Doug McDonald. Doug is the director of the Indians Into Psychology program at the Universityof North Dakota. Dr. McDonald. STATEMENT OF JUSTIN [DOUG ] MCDONALD, DIRECTOR, INDI- ANS INTO PSYCHOLOGY PROGRAM, UNIVERSITY OF NORTHDAKOTA Mr. M CDONALD . Thank you, Senator Dorgan and Representative Pomeroy, distinguished tribal leaders with us here today. I want tosend an apology out to my elders, I am uncomfortable with myback to you. So I ask for your forgiveness. I am honored to be among this panel today, yet deeply regret its necessity. My name is Doug McDonald, I am a professor of psychol-ogy at the University of North Dakota and director of our IndiansInto Psychology program, which is funded by the Indian HealthService. I would like to extend a very heart-felt and public ac-knowledgment and thank you to you, Senator Dorgan, for your un-swerving support of the program over the years. I am a member of the Oglala Lakota Nation of Pine Ridge, SD, and grew up on my family's quarter horse ranch on the NorthernCheyenne Reservation of southeastern Montana. I am a licensedpsychologist and have supervised over 100 Indian graduate and un-dergraduate psychology students. Our program and departmenthas produced over 30 post-graduate graduations for our Native stu-dents. I currently supervise three practicum sites in which our doctoral clinical students work exclusively with troubled American Indianyouth on our surrounding reservations. I myself have consulted inIndian Health Service clinics, group homes and reservation schoolsystems since 1992. I also recently led a team of graduate studentsin responding to the crisis at Red Lake. With all of that said, I only wish that all of these efforts were enough to do more than dent the surface of the huge and complexproblem that brings us here today. Today, a male American Indianadolescent in North Dakota is just as likely to die by his own handthan any other means by the time he turns 25. Although youth sui-cide prevalence rates across our region vary, they still run fromtwo to five times higher than for their non-Indian counterparts.24 Although these numbers are alarming, yet they represent only the tip of a more frightening iceberg, in my opinion. Our reserva-tion youth are being seen and in many cases hospitalized for suici-dal behavior, which may range from ideations or threats to an ac-tual attempt at a rate that far exceeds those for any age cohort ofany cultural and racial group. In my unique position, I have beenable to observe this scenario on seven of our regional reservationsover the past two decades. While I am typically a very optimistic person, which hopefully a psychologist should be, I must say that I see this tide rising withtsunami force, with precious little defenses to stem its might. I donot fear what we know. We know Indian youth suicide in our re-gion is a serious problem. I fear what we do not know. I, along withmy colleagues, have spent the greater portion of my professionallife trying to help folks realize that American Indians are the leastrepresented American ethnic minority group for which appropriateand reliable mental health research exists, as has been discussedsomewhat today. I have spent the remainder of it trying to contribute to that still inadequate body of literature. We do not know why the problem isso large. We don't even really know how large it is. We may specu-late as to the relative contributions of poverty, substance abuse,child abuse and neglect, inter-generational trauma, boardingschools, insufficient health care and education, and certainly thesevariables are all factors. But we can only guess as to the relativesize of their impact and the degree to which they interact withsuch obviously brutal synergy. For some reason, or constellation of reasons, our Native youth have come to a place, as we just heard, where the most basichuman social skill and interaction, talking about their problems, isnot seen as either productive or viable. It is my opinion that thisphenomenon forms the Rosetta Stone by which all these other rel-evant variables may be better understood. So in simple terms, what needs to be done? I believe the an- swers, just as the questions, must be complex and powerful. In es-sence, three components are key. First, clearly, we need more an-swers. And answers may only be achieved through methodologi-cally sound, yet culturally appropriate and competent research andprofessional training. Research requires resources. These resources include time, money, expertise and logistics. Any effort that Federal, State, trib-al, or even private entities can produce can be considered in orderto increase the knowledge base regarding Indian youth suicide. The second component is treatment, as again we have heard sev- eral times. And this treatment must take many forms and be holis-tic and as creative as it is consistent. For example, local tribal andcommunity customs must be recognized and followed if there is anyhope that they will be embraced and effective. Elders and old waysmust be respected to the same degree as evidence-based protocol. Finally, tribes and communities themselves must embolden themselves toward taking monumental leaps of faith and not onlyallowing but participating in data gathering and healing. Too often,tribes have been exploited by outside researchers swooping in andout of town, never to be seen or heard from again.25 Reopening those doors will not be easy. Yet it may become nec- essary in order to gain a greater understanding of this monstrous problem that is causing our children to believe that a gun or hand-ful of pills is a more worthwhile option than asking someone totalk. Thank you.Senator D ORGAN . Dr. McDonald, thank you. Relative to your comment about respecting the culture and so on, we did, as would be a custom, invite a Hidatsa elder and spiritualleader, Sadie Mann, to testify this morning. She was intending todo that, but called this morning and said she was not able to behere. I just wanted everyone here to know that we had made thatinvitation, so she was on the list of those who would testify. Dr. Paul Dauphinais is the school psychologist at Turtle Moun- tain Schools. Dr. Dauphinais, thank you very much for being here. STATEMENT OF PAUL DAUPHINAIS, SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST, TURTLE MOUNTAIN SCHOOLS Mr. D AUPHINAIS . Thank you for having me. I want to express my sorrow, first of all, for all the children who have died tragically and in hopelessness. The pain and loss of aloved one is very real and very great, as we have heard. That painis unimaginable. My heart goes out to all those who have lost loved ones so trag- ically and to the communities who struggle with trying to find an-swers of why children, especially children, are taken from us. Iwant to thank you, Senator Dorgan, for affording me the oppor-tunity to let Congress know, to let the public know about the sever-ity of the problem and to provide the impetus to do something toprevent these tragedies. When invited by my tribal chairman, Mr. Davis, I accepted the responsibility, because I feel I live on the borrowed time of mygrandchildren, time that I cannot waste, the time that has beengiven to me as a gift and I have a responsibility to respect the giftor the gift could be taken back. My grandparents, in the same way,accepted my gift and provided me the opportunities that I have hadand hopefully will continue to experience. These experiences do notalways bring the things that I would want, but all the experienceshave given me new and important information and I would like tothink that they have made me wiser. I have experienced calls in the night telling me that one of my children has attempted suicide. I have experienced depression, Ihave seen my children in depression and states of hopelessness. Iam thankful my child did not, was not successful in committingsuicide and continues to live, although continues to battle the de-mons of mental illness. I am raising one of my grandsons, and I enjoy him very much. But I know the love he has for his mother and she for him. My story unfortunately is not unlike that of many parents and grandparents living in our Native American communities. Likemany others, the story is not totally one of endless tragedies. Weare blessed with children who have weathered their life with lessdepression and hopelessness and have come to use their borrowed26 time well. One has recently birthed a child, and another is await- ing fatherhood this month. These are very joyous occasions. I was born on Turtle Mountain Chippewa Reservation, grew up in the Yankton Sioux Reservation and have worked on other res-ervation communities and now work on the Turtle Mountain Res-ervation as a school psychologist. I worked as a school counselor,human service administrator and I am a licensed psychologist inNorth Dakota. I am also pathologically optimistic. I am hopeful we can make our grandchildren's time one that will facilitate their potential and that one will give them the supportand strength to have hope. I know that if we really ask our chil-dren about themselves and their experiences, they will respond.The science of psychology tell us that we can and should ask chil-dren if they need help and they will respond to us. I think the chil-dren that were in the panel before us expressed that very clearly. My first wish is that we need to ask our children about them- selves. As a community, we need to support the positive develop-ment of all our children. This includes supporting parents' effortsat providing nurturance and safety to their children and supportingteachers to provide the best educational experience possible. Between 7 and 10 million teenagers suffer from mental health conditions; 90 percent of teens who die by suicide suffer from adiagnosable mental illness at their time of death. In fact, in 63 per-cent of completed suicides, psychiatric symptoms developed morethan 1 year prior to death. It is ironic that by the time they reachadolescence, most young people have been immunized against awide array of threats to their health and well-being, including mea-sles and mumps, hearing, speech, and vision impairments, but feware screened for depression. If we screen, we will have children that we must attend to. At the same time, can we ignore asking our children about themselvesbecause we don't want to hear what they have to say? We are alsoblessed with highly skilled professionals who are native to our com-munity in the Turtle Mountain. We have young professionals thathave been part of Dr. McDonald's INPSYDE, psychologist trainingprogram, who now want to remain in their community. We haveMSW social workers and masters level counselors, school psycholo-gists and a psychiatrist even who want to remain in their commu-nity to contribute to a better future, to respect their borrowed timeand gift. We have begun to use the Teen Screen program researched and designed at Columbia University by Dr. Shaffer. Teen Screen is ascreening program that uses scientifically designed tools to helpidentify youth who are suffering from undiagnosed mental illnessand who are at risk for suicide. In our Turtle Mountain Schools, we have identified over one-half of our older children who have used alcohol or drugs and who haveused meth; over one-half who could be considered clinically de-pressed; and one-fourth could meet the criteria for PTSD. PTSD is a very destroying mental illness that just piles on and on and onevery time a person is traumatized. Dr. Manson from the MentalHealth Research Center in Colorado recently published an articleincluding American Indians living in adverse environments that27 placed them at high risk for exposure to trauma and harmful health sequlae. We have screened those middle school students whose parents gave us permission and who themselves volunteer to take thescreening. The percentage of children with possible mental healthdisorders was higher than the average of the other Teen Screensites throughout the United States. We also found that when wescreened our 1st grade through 5th grade children, 500 or so chil-dren, using the dominic computer interactive program, there wasan extraordinary number of children at risk there, too. We have learned from this that we need the collaboration of In- dian Health Service mental health teams in our particular commu-nity. They have been very, very supportive in that way. Another wish I have is to provide support and a place for new Native professionals. Many want to stay at home, the ones that Ihave had experience with, that I supervise in their practicum inour school system are very well trained and express the willingnessto stay home. We need to find a place for them. We need to support efforts to allow mental health in schools. We can do this through third party reimbursement for services withinschools, and through relaxing of policies that prohibit such practiceby IHS and BIA. We need to support training programs that ex-pand the mentorships of Native psychologists and training, pairedwith the best in the field of helping those who have been trauma-tized, the best in the field of helping children with depression andother mental health disorders. The schools have children for 8 hours a day. We have found through our efforts in Turtle Mountain that having psychologistsand social workers and psychiatrists, as well as the establishedschool counselors, nurses, and social workers in the school, itmakes a big difference in terms of grade improvement and lessen-ing office referrals and providing prevention programs and life skilldevelopment for our children. We have found that by providingskills to children to learn to cope with angry, fearful, worrisomefeelings they respond well in using these skills appropriately. We have available to us Dr. LaFromboise's ''American Indian Life Skills Development Curriculum.'' She is a member of our com-munity and a tenured professor at Stanford University. So thereare programs that exist for Native children. We need to find them,they need to be allowed they need support. These kinds of pro-grams need the Government stamp of approval, so we need to havemore research in those areas. Some of them are very, very good. We need to support those prevention programs designed and re- searched for Native children. We need to support efforts in Nativecommunities with teams of professionals that can respond to trage-dies. We need to support efforts for Native communities to have na-tional teams of Native professionals who can provide the expertisein prevention efforts. Again, I want to thank you, Senator Dorgan. My wish list I sup- pose has grown with the years I have worked in my Indian commu-nities. But I am hopeful and I know there's a pony in there some-where. [Laughter.] I want to thank you personally for the many times you have re- sponded to my family, also. I know you are quite informed about28 the issues that plague the youth in our Native communities and issues that create despondency and hopelessness. I am hopeful youwill continue to support our efforts in our Indian communities. Iwant to thank you again. Senator D ORGAN . Dr. Dauphinais, thank you, and thanks for what you do as well. We appreciate very much your being here. The final witness will be Cynthia Lindquest-Mala. She is the president of the Community College at Fort Totten, but previouslyexecutive director of the North Dakota Indian Affairs Commission,director of the Indian Health program at the University of NorthDakota Medical School. Ms. Lindquest, thank you very much. It says you are a Ph.D candidate. Have you received your Ph.D? Okay. If you will turn that microphone on, thank you. Please pro-ceed. STATEMENT OF CYNTHIA LINDQUIST-MALA, PRESIDENT, CANKDESKA-CIKANA COMMUNITY COLLEGE, FORT TOTTEN Ms. L INDQUIST -MALA. Thank you, Senator, and thank you very much to the U.S. Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, Ms.Bumpas, Ms. Garland, and Senator Dorgan. I do appreciate the opportunity to be here. I do not have pre- pared testimony and I will begin by saying [greeting in nativetongue]. My friends, I am called Star Horse Woman, and I comefrom the Spirit Lake Nation. My professional role is president ofCankdeska-Cikana Community College, Spirit Lake Lakota, FortTotten, ND. I need to share with you, in sharing with you my Indian name, that I have a responsibility. I have come to understand in carryingmy Indian name, my Dakota name, is to speak from my heart. Ispeak the truth as I understand it, as I have come to learn. I needto share with you that I have come up through the ranks profes-sionally as my tribe's health director/planner in the early 1980's, aposition I held for about 7 years. I have worked for the IndianHealth Service at the regional and national level. I am an adjunctassistant professor of community health and rural health for theUniversity of North Dakota School of Medicine and HealthSciences. Why I share that with you, and I am going to come back to my personal story, because I did grow up on the reservation, the Mis-sion District, St. Michael, ND. When my parents went through abitter divorce, I was a teenager. I went through what professionalpeople called culture shock. I did not understand it at the time. Butone of my reactions and responses to going through culture shockand not understanding my identity in being Dakota and Scandina-vian, was that I took to alcohol and subsequently attempted suicidemyself two or three times as a child. In my healing and learning journey, and especially my years as the tribe's health director/planner, the permeation of alcohol andsubstance abuse on the reservation was just unbelievable. So Imade a conscious decision at that point in my life to set that aside.I couldn't be a hypocrite and be my tribe's health director/plannerand have that lifestyle. But alcohol and substance abuse affected everything in our lives and still does. I have been back home as the tribal college presi-29 dent for about 18 months. I have been truly blessed in my healing and learning journey and coming to terms with my identity andidentifying as Dakota. But coming home after having national ex-perience and getting to see Indian country from a national perspec-tive, it is disheartening because of what is happening to our chil-dren. I had a friend visit with me one time from England. We went to a couple of different reservations here in the Dakotas. After theend of the visit, we were just talking about the visit and gettingher impressions. Her impressions were, she loved to be around thechildren, but at the same time, she was saddened, because our chil-dren did not have that spark of life in their eyes. There was almosta sense of despair in young, young kids. And I had never lookedat it that way, especially having come off of being a tribal healthdirector/planner and being so enmeshed in dealing with health andhealth issues. At that point in time, Spirit Lake Nation was deal-ing with four to five suicide attempts a week. We had one bach-elor's level social worker. The program was a tribal health program. We retroceded it back to the Indian Health Service, and it is still with the Indian HealthService. We had contract psychologists and psychiatrists cominginto the reservation. It is still that way. It hasn't changed, in allthe years. That's what hurts, that's what breaks my heart. I love being home, I love being a tribal college president. Because I am seeing optimism and hope in the student body at my collegeand the changes there. What I need to share with you all is that this is a very complex and serious issue, as you so eloquently stated in your opening, Sen-ator Dorgan. It is rooted in history. We can never forget that. Itreflects broken treaties, broken promises. It is linked to what theycall post-traumatic stress, that is so, for me, obvious now in IndianCountry. It is linked to how and why we live the way we live.There are many policies passed with good intentions, but that didnot work, that tried to change how we live. The essence of thosepolicies was the dismantling of our families and the breakup of thestructure of how our families lived and the way we lived. To me, this suicide epidemic happening in Indian country is just a manifestation of all its history and reflects our community's his-torical oppression, the assimilationist policies meant to deal withNative people. Our people are wounded. Our people have woundedsouls and wounded spirits. The data from the deaths reflect communities and families in cri- sis. The healing has to begin by understanding, and understandingmeans different things to different people. We must understandand perpetuate a public understanding of Indian people in thiscountry and its history. The dynamics of what is going on rightnow does in fact reflect this history. We need to create learning en-vironments so non-Indian people understand better that historyand the trauma that we are dealing with. We must create learningenvironments so our people have a better understanding also ofthis trauma and what we need to do to deal with it. As these young people so eloquently stated, this issue of trust, this personal thing with trust, while most teenagers, it doesn'tmatter what culture or community you come from, most teenagers30 have this issue of trust. But for Native people and Native youth, it is especially compounded, because you have this historical trau-ma. We are fearful and we are mistrustful because of these brokenpromises, these broken histories. At the same time, you look around, you look at the healing that is occurring, the wonderful resilience, survivability of the indige-nous people of this country, our compassion, our ability to forgive,our ability to continue to give and to give back. That is the essenceof what is helping our people survive and looking forward until to-morrow, for all tomorrows, for the future. So what can the U.S. Senate Committee on Indian Affairs do to address teen suicide in Indian country? Do what you are doing,Senator Dorgan. Have public forums, official and unofficial. Weneed to talk about it. We need to have mechanisms to do that inwhatever way, whatever level, at different levels of Government,public, private, homes, churches, pow-wows, wherever. Gather thatinformation and data, share it, disseminate it. Demand that theFederal Government, that Congress appropriate adequate resourcesfor our health, our education of our people. Off the top of my head, the Indian Health Service is funded at about 60, 65 percent of need. That gap is growing. It is not gettingsmaller. It is not diminishing. When I used to know these numbers,the mental health services and programs of the Indian HealthService were only funded at 20 to 25 percent of need. I don't thinkthat's changed since I used to do Indian Health work. I think thosenumbers are probably comparable today. Likewise for educationand education systems. As the vice chairman of this committee, Senator, you could go forward and request that all the other Federal agencies open theirdoors for Indian programming, Indian services, Indian resources.Demand that based on this relationship, this unique relationshipour people have with this country, that those promises be fulfilled.Assist in creating learning environments through education, healthcare programming. Have the faith-based organizations come to thetable, be with us, and let's endeavor. Create better training programs for our youth, for peer coun- selors, for our people to become mental health, behavioral healthaides under the CHR model that is so wonderful relative to beinga liaison for health care and health care services. There needs tobe setasides marked for tribal governments, tribal colleges, for eachand every one of the Federal agencies to address this. It has to bea collaborative partnership. It cannot just be the Indian HealthService or SAMHSA. It has to be all of HHS, the Department ofEducation, the Department of Justice, Department of Commence,Department of the Interior, again, working together from a Fed-eral, Congressional level down to the local level so it reaches ourpeople. We do have models. There are many wonderful models out there of community-based partnerships that are culturally appropriate, that are working. One I can just cite off the top of my head is DonCoyhis' Wellbriety program in the White Bison non-profit organiza-tion out of Colorado, grass-roots movement addressing alcohol andsubstance abuse issues. Really literally working in each individual31 district and community to bring national momentum toward ad- dressing alcohol substance problems in Indian country. Overall, there needs to be a sustained infusion of resources, both financial and human, to address this issue, and in a concerted anda partnership way. In closing, the word dakota, hopefully you un-derstand or know it means friend or ally, it comes from a biggerword, wodakota, which means to be in harmony or balance. Indige-nous culture has great beauty and understanding in this relation-ship we have with each other as human beings, the relationshipswe have with mother earth, and the things that we can bring for-ward relative to our knowledge of our healing powers, our resil-iency that we do have here. It is working in many, many of ourcommunities. It needs to be supported, it needs to be expanded. We need to do what these young ladies asked us to do. We need to have activities for them, every day, 24/7. And a variety, youthcenters, whatever. It is happening, it could happen more. I thank you very much for having this today, Senator, and for your courage in taking the lead. [Phrase in native tongue.] We areall related. [Applause.]Senator D ORGAN . Thank you very much. You talk about areas of despair, there are of course areas of in- spiration as well. I mentioned that the three high schoolers whoappeared today were very inspiring. You are not nearly as young,the three of you, but in many ways your individual stories areequally inspiring, in so many ways. I want to thank you very much for your testimony and say to Cynthia, based on what you finished with, this is the first of twohearings. We will hold a second hearing in Washington, DC onJune 15. Senator McCain and I have agreed to hold this field hear-ing and then hold a second hearing. What we are attempting to dois provide some significant focus on a very serious problem. We will ask anyone who attends today or your acquaintances, anyone who wishes to submit formal testimony for the formalrecord which will be published of this committee, I would invite allof you to submit that testimony. You can submit it through my of-fice and it will be made a part of this formal hearing record. I wantto encourage you and urge you to do that, if you wish to. I am going to submit questions for this panel. What I would like to do is submit a list of questions to you to solicit from you thecomplete list of suggestions that you have of how you think our ac-tions ought to address these sets of issues. You all have talked, andso have other witnesses, talked about the larger challenges. Andthere are many\u2014health care, education, you name it, there aremany challenges, no question about that. But at least providing focus on this issue, what are the specific lists of recommendations you would have for Senator McCain, my-self and other members of the committee? I too think that we donot have nearly the funding we need in these areas, and that is a part of it. Then organizing the resources the right way to addressthese issues is another part. Let me ask for a show of hands, if I might, of those who have attended this hearing, how many in this room have either had a32 relative or an acquaintance of theirs commit or attempt suicide? Let me see some hands. [Show of hands.]Senator D ORGAN . I think that, perhaps more than anything any of us can say, describes the severity of this and the urgency of thisissue. I too have an Indian name, I was honored about 10 years agoby the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, in a very inspiring ceremony,and they gave me the name Shantay Unweaka, which meansThinks With His Heart. I think that my passion is with all myheart and I hope yours and Senator McCain's and the members ofour committee, we have to reach out to those young people whoselives are full of despair and hopelessness and say to them, you arenot alone. You are just not alone. There are people who love youand care about you. We want to make the kinds of resources andassistance and help available to you. So that's what this is all about. Again, I am going to submit questions to this panel. I want to thank all those who have ap-peared today. I want to thank Jeanne Bumpus for coming out, representing Senator McCain. She is the Chief of Staff for the Majority and SaraGarland the Chief of Staff for the Minority. But there really isn'tmuch of a majority or a minority in our committee. This is a com-mittee in which all the members take seriously some very signifi-cant problems, and we want to work together to solve them. You have all been very, very patient today. You have sat through a rather lengthy hearing, and this young man is the most patient,what a wonderful way to start the life of a 2-hour hearing and bequite as good as he has been. Let me thank all of you for beinghere in this hearing is officially adjourned. [Whereupon, the hearing was adjourned.](33)APPENDIX ADDITIONAL MATERIAL SUBMITTED FOR THE RECORD PREPARED STATEMENT OF TEXG. H ALL, CHAIRMAN , MANDAN , HIDATSA AND ARIKARA NATION Vice Chairman Dorgan and other members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony today on behalf of the Mandan, Hidatsa andArikara Nation on a very important issue that continues to plague Indian country,and in particular, youth on the several reservations in the State of North Dakota.I apologize that I cannot be present today to testify personally; unfortunately I havepreexisting commitment that would not allow me to be here today. However, I ap-preciate the invitation to provide my comments and more importantly, I appreciatethe efforts that are being made by this committee and Senator Dorgan to addressthe problem with teen suicide among Native American Youth. I also appreciate andthank you for bringing this hearing here to North Dakota so that our tribal mem-bers are able to participate in this important process. I believe the recent tragedy on the Red Lake Reservation and the rash of suicides on the Standing Rock Reservation have caused all of us to open our eyes and realizethat our youth are suffering and are at risk. First and foremost, it is absolutely es-sential that a comprehensive assessment/survey be conducted to determine why ourchildren would even consider suicide an option. That could then be used to identifyour youth who are at risk and develop strategies to address the problems our chil-dren are facing. I would like to begin by providing some background and statistics on suicide in general on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. I will also provide you with infor-mation regarding the lack of resources which hamper our ability to effectively ad-dress this issue and would like to conclude with my recommendations to the com-mittee on how we can better serve the needs of our youth and prevent these tragicevents from occurring. Members of the committee, I do not need to restate the stunning statistic rates for teen suicide among Native youth; you are very aware of these alarming num-bers. I will present to you our most recent data regarding suicide on the FortBerthold Reservation. Fortunately for my reservation, we have not had a successfulsuicide since 2003; we have however, had increasing numbers of attempts. 1. November 2004 through December 2004: 9 gestures, ideations or attempts reported; 2. January 2005 through April 2005: 18 gestures, ideations or attempts reported;3. Law enforcement responds to an average of 2-3 attempts per monthOf course, as the case usually is in Indian country, the lack of resources is the major obstacle in preventing teen suicides and attempts. Two of the major compo-nents that are directly responsible for the intervention and prevention of suicide,mental health and law enforcement services, continue to face decreased funding.The following data represents a synopsis of those services as they are available onthe Fort Berthold Reservation: 1. Mental Health Services:34 $242,565 annual budget for I.H.S. to service a population of approximately 7,000 individuals (roughly $354 per person annually) 1 full-time licensed therapist (Director of Mental Health)\u2014approximately 40 percent of time is spent providing direct patient care other time is spent on ad-ministration and management Full-time Social Services representative\u2014does not provide direct patient care or therapy Full-time Clinical Social Worker position was eliminated from the fiscal year 2005 budget due to lack of funding 1 Contract Psychiatrist\u20141 day every other week (6-hour day\u2014sees average of 25 patients\u2014approximately 10 minutes per patient)\u2014primarily provides medi-cation management 1 Contract Psychologist\u20141 day per week (6 hour-day\u2014sees an average of 5-6 patients per day) Suicide attempts are referred for hospitalization for up to 72 hours off reserva- tion\u2014patient followup is minimal due to lack of mental health services avail-able locally 2. Law Enforcement: Serves 6 tribal communities and over 980,000 acres of land 1BIA Chief of Police and 1 lieutenant\u2014primarily administrators 6 BIA patrol officers 8 tribal polices officers employed under COPS Fast Program Since fiscal year 2003 Tribe has experienced loss of 7 tribal police officers due to COPS Fast budget cuts Facing continued threat of elimination of COPS Fast funding which would re- sult in a loss of 8 officers and leave a total of 8 officers servicing the entire Res-ervation to provide 24 hour coverage It cannot be denied that this lack of essential services has a direct impact on the ability to prevent and intervene in suicides. Another valuable resource for Indiancountry in the area of health care and mental health care needs that is facing elimi-nation due to budget cuts is the Indians into Medicine (INMED), the Recruitmentand Retention of Indian Nurses Program (RAIN) and the Indians into PsychologyProgram. These program are vital to improving the delivery of health and mentalhealth care services in Indian country. We cannot afford to loose these programs. With those matters in mind, I make the following recommendations for immediate action: 1. Increase Indian Health Service Budget to provide additional funding for mental health services with emphasis on funds for youth mental health services; 2. Support the Tribal COPS Fast Program;3. Support continued funding for the INMED, RAIN, and INPSYCH programs; and 4. Assess how public and tribal schools can better serve the mental health needs of children and identify at risk youth. 3. More long range recommendations include: 1. An immediate study/assessment must to be completed to determine why our children are taking or attempting to take their own lives and to provide tools toidentify at risk youth; 2. Use the information from the assessment to address youth needs.Again, I thank you for this opportunity to provide information and hope that you will continue forward with finding solutions to address this problem.35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 "}
