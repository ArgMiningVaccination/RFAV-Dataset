AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY/AFFIRM ATIVE ACTION EMPLOYER Services provided on a nondiscriminatory basis Acknowledgments This document was developed in 1992 as the product of a consensus workgroup formed to develop a plan on the prevention and control of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and other antibiotic resistant organisms in l ong term care facilities. Consensus was achieved following four meetings held in 1991, with representatives from key health care agencies and organizations geographically distributed throughout Missouri. Representatives brought experience in long term care, infection control, infectious diseases, pharmacy, administration, and public health. The original document was subsequently printed several thousand times, distributed statewide to all l ong term care facilities and sent by request to over thirty states and Canada. There has been a continuing need to discuss cr itical issues related to emerging infectious diseases and infection control in the commun ity and in all types of health care facilities statewide. Because of this need, the 1991 consensus group was recognized in 1995 as the advisory body to the Missouri Department of Health and officially named the Advisory Committee on Infection Prevention and Control. Members of the Revision Committee have contributed time and expertise to the revisi on of this 1999 edition, which is endorsed by the entire Advisory Committee. 1999 Revision Committee: Co-Coordinators: Marge Borst, RN, BS, CIC, Department of Health & Senior Services Mary E.

It provides nursing professionals with criteria for identifying specific body-site infections. This enhances the objectivity of reporting signs and symptoms to providers and helps providers make decisions whether or not to culture sites, order other diagnostic tests, and/or prescribe treatment, including antimicrobials. Health care professionals in long-term care facilities can find detailed guidelines in this document for the care of residents with specifi c body-site infections, as well as principles and practices for preventing the sp read of infectious organisms to other residents and staff. Recommending measures to prevent and control the development or spread of antibiotic resistant organisms remains one of the primary purposes of this document. Infection control practices are effective when they are underst ood and carried out by the staff, regardless of staff turnover. These practices must be monito red for residents known to be infected with certain organisms and for residents who are unknowingly infected and/or are asymptomatic carriers of the organisms. The use of this manual should not be limited as a guide for individual resident care, but should be used to establish high quality infection control programs in Missouri long-term care facilities. The manual provides tools for eval uating the incidence of resident or staff infections on specific wards, wings or units in a facility. The epidemiology of evaluating infections by time, place, and person is possible with the use of these tools. Trends can be demonstrated with the use of tables, charts, a nd graphs in order to illustrate where infection control problems exist and where quality improvement is needed. In summary, this manual is intended to be a working document for the staff on each unit and for policymakers in a long term care facility. It will not be helpful to physicians, nurses, technicians, certified nurse assistants, orderlies, or administrative personnel if it is not readily available as a resource. We, the Advisory Committee on Infection Prevention and Control, Missouri Department of Health, encourage users to give us feedback on the benefits and the need for further revisions of this document. With feedback from users, we can all contribute to the assurance that residents in long term care facilities are provided with quality infection control practices.

Infection control includes routine surveillance of residents, surveillance of staff, and surveillance of the environment. This may be accomplished using the following guidelines. Epidemiologic Aspects 1. According to the Missouri Division of Aging rules, all long term care facilities must have infection control policies which are made evident to all new employees at time of orientation. 2 [13 CSR 15-14.042(20) and 13 CSR 15-15.042(18) Occupational Safety and Health Admi nistration (OSHA) mandates policies on surveillance and recordkeeping of exposures to blood and body fluids included under Universal Precautions (see other potentially inf ectious materials) and infections from bloodborne pathogens.3 In addition, infection control experts recommend that long term care facilities (LTCF's) have active, effective infection control programs which include weekly surveillance for nosocomial infec tions and multiply resistant organisms.1,4 (See \"Glossary of Infection Control Terms and Definitions,\" Appendix B.) Besides identification of such infections, a line lis ting should be kept which includes pertinent information regarding residents with infections (Figure 2.1-1). 2. A facility's surveillance policies and procedures should be reviewed and updated on a yearly basis to assure appropriateness and effectiveness in reducing specific body site infections or number of infections with specific organisms. 3. A facility's surveillance system must include the reporting of infectious diseases as required by the Missouri Department of Hea lth. (See \"Reporting Rule, Appendix I. See Figure 2.1-2 for a sample reporting form.) 4. A facility's surveillance system should include monitoring for appropriate antibiotic use. A positive culture in a person without clinical symptoms rarely requires treatment with antibiotics. (See Figure 2.1-3 for a sample monitoring form.) 5. Long term care facilities should request by contract or policy that their laboratory notify the Director of Nursing (DON) or his/her de signee of all positive cultures with a multiply resistant organism or laboratory data indica tive of a reportable disease. This will permit the facility to track the residents with certa in organisms. Tracking a multiply resistant organism or reportable disease includes keep ing records of dates when the resident changes rooms or roommates and also mon itoring resident activities or exposures to others. 6. It is important to track and follow trends of infection data related to both residents and staff on a monthly basis. This information should then be presented to the appropriate Section 2.0 Surveillance Subsection 2.1 Routine Infection Control Surveillance INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES committee on at least a quarterly basis.1 Rates should be calculated by using resident days or average daily census for the surveillance pe riod (such as a month, quarter or year) as the denominator. Examples of tools used in data calculation and presentation are included in Figures 2.1-4, 2.1-5 and 2.1-6. 7. Outbreak investigation should be performed as outlined in Section 7. Infectious Disease Outbreaks. Resident Aspects 1. Assessment of all residents for any/all cha nges in symptoms or conditions which may be indicative of an infection should be perf ormed on an ongoing basis; i.e., clinical observation, house reports, chart and/or Kardex review, culture reports.1 Any change in the resident's condition is to be reported to the private physician. 2. Indications of infection in the elderly may vary from those seen in a younger more healthy population.5 Elderly persons often have a lower body temperature, so an increase in temperature from that which is normal for the resident may be an indication of infection. Other conditions that may indicate an infection in the elderly are: a. Presence of delirium (acute confusional state) b. Rapid major change (worsening) in function in activities of daily living (ADL's) c. Loss of appetite, new or worsening urinary incontinence, cough, increased respiratory rate, falls, or loose stools d. A decline in blood pressure or a rise in pulse rate e. A fall with no previous history of falling 3. Routine culturing of any resident or group of residents should not be performed unless one of the following occurs: a. Resident has clinical signs or sympto ms. A culture done under these circumstances will be useful in treating the resident.6 b. In an outbreak situation, as outlined in Section 7. Infectious Disease Outbreaks. 4. Routine culturing of asymptomatic residents at admission or prior to admission is not recommended. Residents who may be either colonized or infected with a disease producing organism(s) can generally be cared for in the long term care setting by using appropriate infection control practices. Request of culture results from the transferring facility is appropriate upon transfer to assist the receiving facility in understanding clinical history and assure appropriate resident room placement. 5. Assessment of the resident at the time of admission to the facility for communicable diseases and a history of immunization. Th is will assure recognition of communicable diseases that will require special precautions and assure the resident is up-to-date on recommended adult immunizations. (See Section 5. Immunizations.) 6. In accordance with Department of Hea lth rule 19 CSR 20-20.100 (See Appendix E), all residents new to long term care who do not ha ve documentation of a previous skin test Section 2.0 Surveillance Subsection 2.1 Routine Infection Control Surveillance INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES reaction 10mm or a history of adequate treatment of tuberculosis infection or disease, should have the initial test of a Mantoux PPD two- step test to rule out tuberculosis within one month prior to or one week after admission. Thereafter, the resident's tuberculin status is retested only following exposure to a person diagnosed with infectious tuberculosis or when clinical symptoms warrant further investigation. Employee Aspects 1. All new employees should have a baseline health assessment, including a review of their immunization status and history of relevant pa st or present infectious diseases. The past history of infectious diseases should include chickenpox, measles, hepatitis, skin boils and bacterial diarrhea. Use of screening cultures is rarely indicated. 2. All new employees and volunteers shall have a two-step tuberculin skin test using the Mantoux method unless the employee reports a history of a positive tuberculin skin test. Annual tuberculosis evaluations of empl oyees and volunteers shall be performed. Individuals with a positive tuberculin skin test should be evaluated in accordance with Guidelines for Screening for Tuberculosis in Long Term Care Facilities issued in 1995 by the Missouri Department of Health, Section of Vaccine Preventable and Tuberculosis Disease Elimination. (See Section 9. Tuberculosis Control.) Note: A tine test is not an acceptable method of evaluation for tuberculosis in Missouri. 3. Follow-up of an exposure to an infectious disease or substance shall be provided in accordance with current public health gui delines and the OSHA Bloodborne Pathogen Standard of 1991. 4. Each facility should have policies for the ongoing monitoring of employees for infections. Such monitoring should include observation and self-reporting. (See Employee Health in Subsection 3.2 Implementing the Body Substance Precautions System.) Environmental Surveillance Walking rounds to observe environmental conditi ons should be done on a regular basis or at least twice monthly. Observations should be made of equipment decontamination, cleaning procedures in bathroom/tub areas, physical therapy, medication/treatment rooms, kitchen and laundry areas. Observations should be made fo r handwashing, availability of soaps and paper towels, handling of sharps/infectious waste, care of resident supplies for skin care, catheter care, feeding solutions, etc. A clipboard with defined criteria can be used to check areas where changes need to be made or training needs to be done. (See Figures 2.1-7 and 2.1-8 for sample forms for recording environmental observations.)

Stop Sign Alert 3.3 Diseases Transm itted by Airborne Route 3.4 Exam ples of Situations Using the Body Substance Precautions System Section 3.0: Body Substance Precautions Subsection 3.1 Body Substance Precautions System INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FO R LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES BODY SUBSTANCE PRECAUTIONS Body Substance Precautions System For m any years, \"isolation\" has been viewed as the cornerstone to a health care f acility' s infection prevention and control program . Traditional isolation practices that focus on diagnos ed cases of infectious diseases provide an incom plete strategy f or inf ection preventi on practices can cause detrim ental psychosocial ef fects in residents and their f amilies and interf ere with the hom e- like atm osphere that nurses try to establish. For these reasons, a system called Body Subs tance Precautions (BSP), was developed. It focuses on keeping all m oist body substances, (blood, feces, urine, wound drainage, tissues, oral secretions, and other body fluids) from the hands of personnel. This is accom plished prim arily through handwashing and increased glove use. The system elim inates m any of the ritualistic practices associated with traditiona l isolation system s while increasing the use of barriers for all contacts with body substances. The BSP system described in this section is a practical, safe approach that fits well with the extended care environm ent. Although not identical with Standard Precau tions, as recom mended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or Univer sal Precautions, as recom mended by both the American Hospital Association and the Occupa tional Safety and Health Adm inistration, BSP is consistent with both. BSP goes a step further and considers ALL moist body fluids as potentially contagious, regardless of the resident' s diagnosis.1-10 In order to f ollow these recom mendations, the decision to use barrier precautions m ust focus on the care provider' s routine INTERACTIONS with the resident. In the past, the resident' s DIAGNOSIS had been the cornerstone of traditional isolation system s. The m ajor reason for changing from a traditional \"diagnosis-driven\" isolation system to the \"interaction-driven\" BSP is that clinically diagnosed infectious diseases represent only the tip of the iceberg. Many infectious organism s are carri ed without sym ptoms. This is certainly true for bloodborne pathogens such as hum an im munodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) infection. Therefore, focusing isolation precautions only on diagnosed cases of AIDS, hepatitis B and C m isses the vast majority of persons who have the infectious agents in their blood. Sim ilarly, virulent or antibiotic resistant strains of bact eria such as m ethicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancom ycin resistant enterococci (VRE) or gram -negative bacteria m ay colonize body orifices or m oist body surfaces without sym ptoms. These organism s can easily be transm itted from resident to resident on the ha nds of personnel. Because m edical history and physical exam ination cannot reliably identify a ll persons infected with these or other infectious diseases, it m akes far m ore sense to treat ALL moist body substances as potentially infectious rather th an to focus precautions only on the residents that are diagnosed with infectious diseases. The BSP system reduces the risks of such transm issions by the consistent use of barriers whenever contacts with any body substances are likely. Section 3.0: Body Substance Precautions Subsection 3.1 Body Substance Precautions System INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FO R LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES BSP provides a consistent approach to m anaging body substances from ALL residents and is essential in preventing transm ission of potentially infectious agents. The appropriate barrier to be used is select ed after careful consid eration of each specific situation for the overall reasonable expos ure risk associated with the task. Risk factors that should be included in the evaluation include: Type of body fluid with which there is or will be contact. Volum e of blood/body substances likely to be encountered Reasonable anticipation of exposure; e.g., \"will m y hands touch the resident' s secretions?\" Probable route of exposure; i.e., hand contact, airborne, droplet, splashing Microbe concentration in fluid or tissue. Many resident care procedures dictate the use of specific barriers for the resident' s protection (i.e., sterile gloves for dressing changes). Howe ver, when personal protective equipm ent is selected for protection of the caregiver, prof essional judgm ent m ay determ ine when barriers are needed. These personal standards should be based on the individual em ployee' s skills and likely interactions with the resident' s body substances, non-intact skin, and m ucous membranes and not conflict with facility policies/procedures. The risk factors outlined above should be used to assist in the decision-m aking process. In addition to BSP, residents with suspected or diagnosed diseases that are transm itted through an airborne route are placed on Stop Sign Alert in a private room equipped with negative air pressure and 6-12 air exchanges pe r hour. (W hen these conditions cannot be m et, the resident with a suspected or conf irmed airborne disease will be transf erred to another institution according to the transfer policy.) Since traditional garb such as gowns and facem asks were never designed to prevent transm ission of viral infections such as ch ickenpox or m easles a STOP sign is placed on the door to alert personnel and visitors to \"Check with the nurse before entering.\" The nurse can then instruct personnel or visitors as to th e precautions required and/or deny entrance to the room due to their susceptibility f or acquiring the disease (no im munity). For airborne diseases to which im munity does not develop such as tuberculosis, the nurse will direct those entering the room to don appropriate respiratory protection. Section 3.0: Body Substance Precautions Subsection 3.2 Im plem enting the Body Substance Precautions System INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FO R LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES BODY SUBSTANCE PRECAUTIONS Implementing the Body Substance Precautions System Implem enting the Body Substance Precautions system includes the following elem ents and should be followed by ALL personnel at all tim es regardless of the resident' s diagnosis. Gloves Wear gloves when it can be reasonably anticipated that hands will be in contact with m ucous membranes, non-intact skin, any m oist body subs tances feces, wound drainage, oral secretions, sputum , vom itus, or item s/surfaces soiled with these substances) and/or persons with a rash. Federal OSHA law s require that gloves must be w orn w hen performing vascular access procedures. (Gloves are not required for intram uscular injections or allergy injections unle ss contact with blood is anticipated.) Gloves must be changed betw een residents and betw een contac ts with different body sites of the same resident. If the glove is torn or a needle stick or other injury occurs, the glove should be removed, discarded in the trash and a new glove used prom ptly as resident safety perm its. REMEMBER: Gloves are not a cure-all. They should reduce the likelihood of contam inating the hands, but gloves cannot preven t penetrating injuries due to needles or sharp objects. Dirty gloves are worse than dirt y hands because m icroorganism s adhere to the surface of a glove easier than to the skin on your hands. Handling m edical equipm ent and devices with contam inated gloves is not acceptable. Always select the type of glove that is appropriate for the task being perform ed. Non- powdered gloves are preferred as they decrease the risks for acquiring a latex allergy. The following general guidelines are recom mended: 1. Use sterile gloves for procedures involving contact with norm ally sterile areas of the body. 2. Use exam ination gloves for procedures involving contact with m ucous m embranes (unless sterile gloves are indicated) and for ot her resident care or diagnostic procedures that do not require the use of sterile gloves. 3. Gloves are to be worn for vascular access procedures or drawing blood. 4. Change gloves between contacts (as defined above) with different residents or with different body sites of the sam e resident. 5. Do not wash or disinfect surgical or ex amination gloves for reuse. W ashing with surfactants m ay cause \"wicking,\" i.e., the enhanced penetration of liquids through undetected holes in the glove. Disinfecting agents m ay cause glove deterioration. Section 3.0: Body Substance Precautions Subsection 3.2 Im plem enting the Body Substance Precautions System INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FO R LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES 6. Use general-purpose utility gloves (e.g., r ubber household gloves) for housekeeping or plant engineering chores involving potential blood contact and for instrum ent cleaning and decontam ination procedures. Utility glove s may be decontam inated and reused but should be discarded if they are peeling, cracke d, or discolored; or if they have punctures, tears, or other evidence of deterioration. 7. If two pairs of gloves are worn, one on t op of the other, both pairs are considered contam inated after use and both pairs m ust be changed. 8. Medium sized non-powdered gloves should be placed in each resident room . Other sizes should be available in a treatm ent room or supply closet. If gloves are creating an allergic response, hypoallergenic gloves or glove liners m ust be m ade available. 9. Use hand lotions to protect skin; however, pe troleum -based hand lotions such as Vaseline will cause latex to deteriorate. 10. Be alert to and report signs and sym ptoms of latex sensitivity (e.g.: dry, itchy, irritated areas on hands; rash that begins 24-48 hours after contact to latex; im mediate skin redness; hives or itching; and/or respirat ory sym ptoms from runny nose to difficulty breathing). Handwashing Handwashing rem ains the single m ost effectiv e means of preventing disease transm ission. Wash hands often and well, paying particular attention to around and under fingernails and between the fingers. Wash hands w henever they are soiled w ith body substances, before food preparation, before eating, after us ing the toilet, before performing invasive procedures and w hen each resident's care is completed . Proper handwashing technique includes these steps: 1. Use a sink with warm running water, soap, and paper towels. 2. Push sleeves up above wrists (som e recom mend rem oving jewelry and wristwatch). 3. Apply soap to the hands and wash the hands vigorously using plenty of lather and friction for 10 or m ore seconds; interlace fingers and rub palm s and the back of the hands in a circular m otion; clean between fingers and vigorously clean the fingertips and nail beds. 4. Rinse hands and wrists thoroughly, keeping hands down and elbows up. 5. Dry hands thoroughly from the fingers down to the forearm s and wrists with a paper towel; if available, use clean paper towel to turn of f the water. The use of antiseptic handwashing soaps are recom mended during outbreaks, following gross contam ination, prior to perform ing invasive pr ocedures and prior to caring for high risk Section 3.0: Body Substance Precautions Subsection 3.2 Im plem enting the Body Substance Precautions System INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FO R LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES individuals; e.g., im munocom prom ised. W aterless antiseptic hand cleaners or towelettes m ay be used if hands cannot be washed right afte r soiling, but soap and water m ust be used as soon as feasible. The use of alcohol based ri nses or foam s with a non-drying em ollient are occasionally used as an adjunct to handwashing. Face and Ey e Protection Wear m asks and/or eye protection when it is lik ely that eyes and/or m ucous m embranes will be splashed with body substances, (e.g., when su ctioning a resident with copious secretions, emptying fluids, irrigating a wound). These ite ms should be available and accessible for personnel when needed. After use, either di scard disposable m asks/eye shields in the resident' s room or place reusable goggles or face shields in a specified container in the utility room until they can be washed with soap and water. Apron or Gown Protect clothing with a plastic apron or gown when it is likely that clothing will be soiled with body substances. These item s are prim arily designed to reduce the soiling of the clothing of personnel with m oist body substances . They should be worn any tim e soiling of clothes is anticipated. They should be re moved and discarded after com pletion of each resident contact task. Lab coats when soiled with blood or body fluids should be rem oved as soon as feasible and placed in the facility laundry for cleaning. Sharps Handling and Disposal 1. Contam inated needles m ust never be recapped by hand. W hen available, needle recapping, resheathing or rem oval devices should be used. In their absence, a one-handed \"scoop\" technique m ust be used. 2. Contam inated needles m ust never be rem oved from syringes by hand. If it is necessary to remove a needle from a syringe, use a hem ostat or other device. 3. Needles m ust never be bent, broken or sheared by hand. 4. Broken glass and sharps (including disposable razors) that are contam inated m ust never be picked up by hand. Tongs or a brush and dustpan m ust be utilized for this purpose. 5. All sharps m ust be disposed of in a closable, puncture-resistant container that is red or labeled with a biohazard sym bol. It m ust be leakproof on the sides and bottom , and kept upright throughout use and disposal. It m ust be replaced routinely and not be allowed to be overfilled. The container m ust be easily accessi ble to staff (ideally at the point of use WITHOUT any m anipulation of the syringe) a nd located as close as feasible to the Section 3.0: Body Substance Precautions Subsection 3.2 Im plem enting the Body Substance Precautions System INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FO R LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES immediate area of use. Prior to rem oving a sharps container, it m ust be securely closed to prevent spillage or protrusion of contents dur ing handling, storage, transport or shipping. Employ ee Health Health care workers with skin problem s such as open lesions or weeping skin rash m ust refrain from all direct resident care and f rom handling resident-care equipm ent until cleared by the facility adm inistrator or his/her design ee. These conditions put the em ployee and the resident at risk of infection. Division of Aging rules (13 CSR 15-14.042 and 13 CSR 15-15.042) regulate exposure of residents to staff with com municable diseases. (See Appendix C) Handling Laboratory Specimens All specim ens for the laboratory should be in l eakproof containers that are recognizable as holding specim ens only. If the outside of the container is contam inated, the specim en and container should be discarded and another sam ple obtained. W hen this is not possible, the specim en container should be placed in a l eakproof, biohazard labeled or red bag/red container for handling, processing, storage and transport. If the specim en is leaving the facility for any r eason, it m ust have a biohazard label or be in a red bag/red container. Consistent with the need to treat all blood and body substances as if they are potentially infectious, DO NOT place \"MRSA\", \"VRE\", \"blood pr ecautions\", \"AIDS\", or other infection labels specim ens from residents with identif ied inf ections. Using ' special precautions' labels on specim en tubes and containers encourages a false sense of security and potentially increases risk to personnel who m ay handle unlabeled specim ens less carefully than they should. However, it is always im portant to write the resident' s diagnosis on laboratory requests, x-ray requests, pathology requests, etc., because the diagnosis has clinical relevance. If trays are used to tran sport specim ens in the f acility, they m ust be labeled with the biohazard sym bol. Also, always follow laboratory instructions for com plete specim en labeling regarding resident' s nam e, age, room , type specim en, how specim en collected, date of collection, facility and othe r requested inform ation. This inform ation is extrem ely im portant to laboratories as it contributes to the quality of laboratory reports. For inform ation on specim en collection, see S ection 4. Collection and Transport of Labora- tory Specim ens. Soiled Linen Section 3.0: Body Substance Precautions Subsection 3.2 Im plem enting the Body Substance Precautions System INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FO R LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES Laundry workers, whose job entails sorting or handling contam inated linens, should wear gloves and other protective apparel as appropriate to prevent linens com ing into contact with skin and clothes. No special procedures ar e needed for laundry from persons known to be infected. Theref ore, if linen is processed with in the f acility, it need not be labeled except to identify all used linen as contam inated. If a com mercial laundry that does not utilize Universal Precautions processes linen, then the transportable containers m ust either be red or have a biohazard label. Guidelines for appropriate m anagem ent of soiled linen include: Place all soiled linens in laundry bags provided at the point of use. Avoid contact with your uniform /clothing and surrounding patient care equipm ent. Do not shake or place linen directly on the floor. For linens lightly to m oderately m oist, f old and/or roll in such a way as to contain the moist area in the center of the soiled linen. For soiled linens that are saturated with m oisture, place them in a plastic bag f ollowed by tying or knotting the open end. The plastic bag containing wet linens should then be placed in an approved laundry bag and closed before transporting to the proper designated area. DO NOT OVERFILL BAGS more than 2/3 of capacity as overf illed bags tend to rupture if they are dropped. Disposal of Regulated Waste From Resident's Rooms According to OSHA, regulated waste is defined as: Liquid or sem i-liquid blood or other potentially infectious m aterials (OPIM); Contam inated item s that would release blood or other potentially infectious m aterials in a liquid or sem i-liquid state if com pressed; Items that are caked with dried blood or ot her potentially infectious m aterials and are capable of releasing these m aterials during handling; Contam inated sharps; and wa stes containing blood or OPIM. All trash generated f rom individual resident' s room s, with the exception of fluid-f illed containers and regulated waste as above, can be di sposed of in regular trash bags as per usual practice. Fluid-Filled Containers All fluid-filled containers (e.g. suction canisters and hem ovacs) m ay be em ptied directly into a hopper or toilet. Personnel should wear prot ective attire (gloves, goggles) to protect them selves from splashes unless a protective m echanical barrier (splash shield) is provided. Section 3.0: Body Substance Precautions Subsection 3.2 Im plem enting the Body Substance Precautions System INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FO R LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES If fluid-filled containers are disposed of without em ptying, follow the regulated waste handling procedures of the f acility. These procedur es must utilize closable containers that are leak proof and are either red or biohazard labe led. If the outside of the container becom es contam inated, the regulated waste m ust be placed in a second labeled or red container before being transported by a licensed inf ectious waste hauler. Alternatively, a f acility can decontam inate all regulated waste in accordance with Departm ent of Natural Resources (see Appendix F) and Departm ent of Health (see Appendix G) rules.11-13 Wound Dressings All wound dressings are to be disposed of in a manner so as to \"confine and contain\" any blood/body fluids that m ay be present: 1. Small dressings can be enclosed in the dis posable glove used to rem ove the dressing. Pull the glove off inside out containing the dressi ng inside of it. This dressing and the gloves can then be discarded into the regular trash container in the resident' s room . 2. Larger dressings should be rem oved using gloved hands and placed into a leakproof bag. Small plastic bags are available as a \"dressi ng change bag\" that can be used at the bedside. This bag can be used for the ol d dressing, gloves, and other trash from the dressing change procedure. This bag can generally be deposited into the regular trash container in the resident' s room unless satu rated with blood or as defined above as a regulated waste. Environmental Cleaning Proper cleaning of the environm ent is an esse ntial com ponent of the entire spectrum for preventing and controlling infections. Detailed pr ocedures, schedules and training m ust be in place for daily cleaning in all resident areas in order to reduce bacterial load (quantity of bacteria). Routine cleaning should be done w ith a disinfectant or disinfectant/detergent registered with the Environm ental Protection Agency (EPA), the evidence of which is an EPA num ber on the product label. Cleaning agents and disinfectants m ust be appropriate for the type of soilage and the surface or equipm ent to be decontam inated. All equipm ent, protective coverings on equipm ental surfaces, working surfaces (countertops, etc.), bins, pails, cans and sim ilar receptacles m ust be regularly observed for contam ination with blood or other potentially infectious materials (OPIM). If such contam ination is known to have occurred, then prom pt cleaning and decontam ination m ust be carried out. Low level disinfectants with or without com bined detergents should rem ove or kill m ost bacteria within 10 m inutes contact tim e. Lo w level disinfectants are appropriate for noncritical item s; i.e., those that com e into contact with intact skin such as bedpans, crutches, bed rails, bedside tables, floors and furniture . Such disinfectants are iodophors, phenolics, Section 3.0: Body Substance Precautions Subsection 3.2 Im plem enting the Body Substance Precautions System INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FO R LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES quaternary am monium com pounds (QUATS) d iluted per m anufacturer's recom mendations and sodium hypochlorite (bleach solution) diluted to 100 ppm (1/4 oz/gallon water). Good housekeeping practices begin with fresh cleaning cloths, fresh cleaning or m opping solutions, and clean buckets and m op heads on a daily basis. Solution should be changed frequently throughout the day, but particularly if solution becom es gray (possibly every 3 room s). Cleaning should always start with the cleanest part of the room (top areas) and proceeds to the dirtiest-bottom , floor areas and then the commode or toilet area. Always clean grossly soiled areas (feces, urine, vom itus, sputum , and drainage) with an organic cleaner/detergent before using the disinfectant. Mop heads shoul d be bagged and laundered at the end of the day or when grossly soiled. For blood or OPIM spills , first absorb m ost of the bloody spill using a gel agent or paper towels. Next, clean area with dispos able towels while wearing gloves. (Disinfectants w ill not w ork in the presence of organic matter.) Then apply an EPA-registered disinfectant labeled as effective against HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) such as Iodophors, phenolics, \"Quats\"14,15, according to the m 1:65) sodium hypochl orite (1.3 oz. or 2 oz. per gallon of water). If sodium hypochlorite is used for large blood or OPIM spills, use 5000 ppm (1:10; 13 oz./gallon of water) let stand for 10 m inutes. (Mixed sodi um hypochlorite is only stable for 24 hours.) After cleaning and disinfection, carefully discard rags into a plastic bag.16 Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) To m inimize the need outh-to-m outh re suscitation, resuscitation devices (m outhpieces, pocket m asks, and resuscitation bags) should be located in designated areas within the facility. No transm ission of hepatitis B viru s (HBV) or hum an im munodeficiency virus (HIV) via m outh-to-m outh resuscitation has been docum ented. However, because of the risk of salivary transm ission of other infectious diseases (e.g., herpes simplex and Neisseria meningitidis ) and the and transm ission during artif icial ventilation of residents, resuscitation devices should be used. Disposable resuscitation equipm ent and devices should be used once a nd disposed of or, if reusable, thoroughly cleaned and disinfected after each use following m anufacturer' s guidelines. Resident Placement, Activity Restriction and the Use of Private Rooms for Infection Prevention and Control The physician and persons responsible for infection control should assess individual residents as to the potential f or transm itting in fectious organism s. Room assignm ents and restriction of activities are determ ined by th is assessm ent. Although there are m any reasons for using private room s, the m ajor reasons are di seases transm itted in whole or in part by the Section 3.0: Body Substance Precautions Subsection 3.2 Im plem enting the Body Substance Precautions System INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FO R LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES airborne route or by the resident who extensively soils the environm ent with body substances. Private room s are generally indicated for resi dents with uncontrollable excretions (diarrhea), secretions, excessive coughing, heavy wound drainage or widespread skin disease. Residents should be confined to their room s while the a bove conditions exist. If no private room s are available, the resident could be placed in a sem i-private room with a resident considered at low risk for developing an infection , such as one who is: ambulatory well-nourished and hydrated able to take care of daily needs not needing invasive lines or tubes not im munocom prom ised by disease or drugs Residents considered at higher risk for coloniz ation with a specific pathogen (including multiply-resistant organism s) and subsequent inf ection are those who: have had m ultiple courses of antibiotics or prolonged antibiotic therapy are on dialysis (hem o or peritoneal) or have renal failure are im munocom prom ised, on long-term steroids or chem otherapy have an open wound, surgical or non-surgical; e.g., pressure ulcers have an invasive site; e.g., I.V., gastrostom y, foley, tracheostom y If a m ultiply resistant organism has been identif ied by culture as colonizing or inf ecting a resident, he/she should share a room with another resident having the sam e organism , preferably with the sam e antibi ogram . If a resident is not available with the sam e organism , the room mate should be a resident who is c onsidered at low risk for colonization and subsequent infection with that organism , as m entioned above. Activities Coherent residents, coloniz ed or infected with a specific pathogen, m ay participate in nursing hom e activities and m ay eat in the dini ng hall. Since there are both recognized and unrecognized pathogen carriers participating in nursing hom e activities, all residents should be considered colonized and should have wounds or invasive sites cleansed, covered, and have hands washed before leaving their room s. Conversely, residents m ay have m inor or chronic infections, which pose no risk to others within the bounds of ordinary social settings and acceptable behavior. Allowances should be m ade, where there is no m eans of transm itting the organism to others, to allow th ese residents to engage in certain activities; i.e., a resident who is continent or has an i ndwelling catheter and has a urinary tract infection or a resident who has a scant am ount of drai nage on a wound that is covered with a clean secure dressing. Each resident should be assessed individually prior to restricting activities. Section 3.0: Body Substance Precautions Subsection 3.2 Im plem enting the Body Substance Precautions System INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FO R LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES Physician's Role in Implementing the Body Substance Precautions Sy stem 1. It is not necessary to write an order for \"isolation precautions\" in the resident' s chart. 2. If the resident has a disease which is transm itted in whole or in part by the airborne route (See Subsection 3.3 Diseases Transm itted by Air borne Route) this inform ation should be written on the ORDER SHEET so the nurse can place a STOP SIGN ALERT (See Figure 3.1-1) on the resident' s door. 3. Each physician needs to evaluate his/her ow n interactions with the resident and use barriers as appropriate, based on anticipated contact with body substances, not the resident' s diagnosis of infection. 4. All physicians should know their own chic kenpox, m easles and rubella im mune status. Those who perform invasive procedures ar e advised to know their HIV antibody status and their hepatitis B antigen status as advised by 19 CSR 20-26.050 and 19 CSR 20- 26.060 (See Appendix H). Participation in a tuberculosis screening program and vaccination against the current influenza viruses is recom mended. 5. All physicians who have frequent contact with blood or body fluids should be im munized against Hepatitis B. 6. The use of private room s for infection prevention and control. There are m any reasons for requesting privat e room s as a m edical necessity. However, the m ajor infection prevention and control reasons for a private room are when the resident has a disease that is transm itted in w hole or in part by the airborne route or when the resident extensively soils the environm ent with body substances. Exam ples include any resident with uncontrollable excretions , excessive coughing, secretions or heavy wound drainage. This resident should be segreg ated from other residents and confined to his/her room during the period in which the above condition(s) exist. If no private room s are available, the resident could be placed in a sem i-private room with a low-risk resident. The physician and infection contro l practitioner should individually assess each resident. Role of Nurses and Other Health Care Workers in Implementing the Body Substance Precautions Sy stem 1. Each health care worker needs to evaluate hi s/her own interactions with the resident and use barriers as appropriate, based on anticipated contact with body substances, not the resident' s diagnosis of infection. Use the guidelines described in BSP to m ake these judgm ents. Section 3.0: Body Substance Precautions Subsection 3.2 Im plem enting the Body Substance Precautions System INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FO R LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES 2. If the resident has a disease which is transm itted in whole or in part by the airborne route, the nurse is responsible for assuring the appr opriateness and safety of persons wishing to enter the resident' s room . Use the guidelines described in Precautions for Residents with Airborne Diseases in this section to m ake these judgm ents. 3. All health care workers should know their own chickenpox, m easles, m umps and rubella immune status. Participation in a tuberculos is screening program and vaccination against the current influenza viruses is recom mended. 4. All health care workers who are reasonably expected to have contact with blood or body fluids will be offered hepatitis B vaccination.10,17 Precautions for Residents With Airborne Diseases Some diseases are transm itted through an air borne route and require precautions beyond the routine Body Substance Precautions. Airborne di seases are transm itted on tiny particles in the air. Fortunately, there are fe w airborne diseases seen in the United States (m easles, TB, chickenpox and dissem inated herpes zoster). Th ere are basically two types of airborne diseases: 1. Those that people develop im munity to after vaccination or exposure and 2. Those to which you do not develop im munity after exposure. All residents infected with an ai rborne disease m ust be placed in a private room that receives 6-12 air exchanges per hour and is under negative air pressure. In the past, m asks, gowns and gloves were used to prevent persons from being exposed to residents with chickenpox, measles etc. Unfortunately, these devices do not protect health care workers from these diseases as evidenced by health care work ers (HCW s) acquiring infection even when wearing these item s. For this reason, the im munological history of the HCW is im portant. Instead of relying on ineffective barriers to pr event transm ission, it m akes far m ore sense to assign only personnel who have docum ented im munity to m easles and chickenpox to care for these residents. For diseases that do not elicit im munity, such as tuberculosis, special respiratory protective m asks (N-95 m asks) m ust be worn to provide adequate protection. When a diagnosis is not definitive, all health care workers should wear m asks to prevent inadvertent exposure. Precautions Private room with negative air pressure and 6-12 air exchanges per hour. \"Stop Sign Alert\" on door (See Figure 3.1-1) Door closed Stop Sign Alert Section 3.0: Body Substance Precautions Subsection 3.2 Im plem enting the Body Substance Precautions System INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FO R LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES When a patient is suspected of or known to have a disease transm itted in whole or in part by the airborne route, the physician needs to request a private room and write \" STOP SIGN ALERT \" with the diagnosis or \"rule out\" diagnosis on the order sheet. This will prom pt the nurse to place a \"Stop Sign Alert\" (see Figure 3.1-1) on the door to the patient' s room . The Stop Sign Alert instructs anyone about to enter the room to \"check w ith the nurse before entering.\" IMPORTANT: The \"Stop Sign Alert\" sign is only to be used for residents with airborne diseases as listed in Subsection 3.3 Diseases Transm itted by Airborne Route. The facility should instruct all staff to recognize this si gn and to follow the appropriate respiratory precautions. Nurse Responsibilities 1. Placing a \"Stop Sign\" on the patient's door. 2. Assigning a patient to a private room equi pped w ith special ventilation (negative air pressure). Since the diseases listed in Subsection 3.3 Diseases Transm itted by Airborne Route are transm itted in whole or in part by the airborne route, the door should remain closed at all times. In room s where special ventilation is not available, f ans m ay be appropriate f or placem ent in the window. Fans m ust face outwa rd (toward the outside) to create negative air pressure. The f acility m ust evaluate the appropriateness of using a portable f an versus transferring the resident to a higher level of care. 3. Instructing persons w ishing to enter the room to EITHER: a) Wear a m ask Example: For a patient with active tuberculosis or any of the other airborne diseases listed in Subsection 3.3 Dis eases Transm itted by Airborne Route which are m arked with an asterisk (*), all persons entering these room s shall be instructed to wear a m ask. b) Enter or not enter the room based on their im mune status Some diseases confer lifelong im munity such as m easles and chickenpox, (diseases m arked with a double asterisk [**] in Subsection 3.3 Diseases Transm itted by Airborne Route). For thes e cases, the nurse is responsible for determ ining the im mune status of the person who wishes to enter the room . Example: If the patient has chickenpox or m easles, persons entering the room who have not been vaccinated or do not have a history of having the disease should not enter the room because m asks do not guarantee protection against these viral infections. If there is a history of chickenpox and/or m easles or docum entation of vaccination, the person m ay enter the room without a m ask. Section 3.0: Body Substance Precautions Subsection 3.2 Im plem enting the Body Substance Precautions System INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FO R LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES Transportation of the Patient With an Airborne Disease Residents with diseases transm itted by an airborne route should not be transported unnecessarily to other departm ents. If these resi dents m ust be transported, they should wear a mask, and for diseases m arked with a \"**\" in Subsection 3.3 Diseases Transm itted by Airborne Route, the transporter should be im mune to the disease. (The receiving departm ent should be notified in advance so that im mune personnel can be assigned to perform the procedure). Although m asks are generally not help ful when care givers wear them to protect them selves from airborne viruses, placing surg ical m asks on the patient with an airborne disease will m inimize the droplets that m ay be shed into the air when coughing, laughing, sneezing, etc. Therefore, m asks should be placed on any patient with an airborne disease when transporting to another departm ent within the f acility.

Residents with these diseases need to be assigned to private room s equi pped with special ventilation, (negative air pressure), and have a \" STOP SIGN ALERT \" posted on the door. The door should rem ain closed at all times. In room s where special ventilation is not available, fans can be placed in the window facing out to create negative pressure. Diseases How Long to Apply Airborne Precautions Comments ** Chickenpox (Va ricella ) Until all lesio ns are cru sted. Perso ns who are n ot susceptible do not need to wear a m ask. Exposed suscept ible residents shoul d be i solated begi nning on t he 8th day after first exposure until 21 days after the last exposure. ** Disseminated Shingles (Herpes Z oster or localiz ed Herpes Z oster in immunocompromised resident) Duration of illness. Localized lesions in im munocom - prom ised resi dents frequent ly becom e dissem inated. Use the sam e precautions as for dissem inated disease. * Tuberculosis (TB)- pulmonary; confirmed or suspected. In most instances, duration can be guided by clinical response and a reduct ion in num bers of TB organi sms on sput um smear. Usually th is occurs with in 2-3 weeks after chem otherapy is begun. W hen the resi dent is likely to be infected with INH-resistan t organism s, apply precautions until resident is improvi ng and sput um smear is n egative for TB organi sms. Prompt use of multiple effectiv e anti-tubercul osis drugs i s the most effectiv e means of limiting trans- mission. R esidents shoul d be taught to cover nose and m outh with several layers o f tissu es wh en coughing or sneezing. A m ask must cover t he resi dent's nose and mouth when out of the room for any reason. Rubeol a (Hard Measl es) Until 4 days after ap pearan ce of rash Communicability is m inimal after second day of rash. Vaccine virus is not com municable. Persons not suscept ible do not need to wear a m ask. Search for and i mmunize exposed suscept ibles (wi thin 72 hours of exposure) or gi ve IG (wi thin 6 days of exposure). *Wear a mask with a minimal designation as N-95. **All persons who are not immune to these diseases should not enter the rooms of these residents. NOTE: Suspect ed or di agnosed Mycobact erium tubercul osis infection is a report able Category I disease, whi ch must be report ed to the Depart ment of Heal th within 24 hours as requi red by 19 C SR 20-20.020. See Appendi x I for com plete copy of 19 C SR 20-20.020 t hat lists all report able diseases. The facility shall also repor t to the Division of Aging when a reside nt is diagnosed as having a com municable disease as requi red by 13 C SR 15-14.042(78) and 13 CSR 15-15.042(34). See Appendi x C. for rel evant portions of t hose rul es. Section 3.0 Body Substance Precautions Subsection 3.4 Exam ples of Situations For Body Substance Precautions INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FO R LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES BODY SUBSTANCE PRECAUTIONS Examples of Situations Using the Body Substance Precautions System Because the BSP system is a judgm ent and skill-based system , each individual m akes his/her own decisions about when to wear gloves and use other barriers based on their own skill and their interaction with the resident' s body substa nces, non-intact skin or m ucous m embranes. Facilities also establish policies and procedures for when staff m ust use barrier precautions. Here are som e exam ples of typical situations: Caring for Incontinent Residents Gloves should be worn routinely for cleaning in continent residents and for helping residents with toileting activities. It is difficult to clean an incontinent resident without getting urine and/or stool on the hands. The m ajor risk wh en perform ing this task is getting stool underneath the fingernails. Gloves reduce this risk and m ake handwashing after com pleting the task easier and m ore efficient. A plastic apron m ay be needed for cleaning incontinent residents and changing the bed. Always obtain the plastic apron BEFORE the tasks are begun. Empty ing Urinary Catheter Bags When a care provider is em ptying a urinary cathe ter bag, this should be viewed as a single interaction to a single resident. The task for one resident should be com pleted before going to the next resident. Gloves should be worn to em pty catheter bags as it is difficult not to get urine on the hands. Gloves m ust be changed a nd hands washed between residents. It is unacceptable to consider it a single task to em pty the catheter bags for several residents in sequence without changing gloves and washing hands between residents. This is because of the real risk of transm itting organism s from the catheter bag drainage spout of one resident to the next resident' s drainage spout via the ha nds of personnel. Each resident should have his/her own labeled individual graduate containe r for draining the catheter bag. This prevents a resident' s catheter bag drainage spout from becom ing contam inated with organism s from other residents' urine as when a com mon gra duate or em ptying container is used for all persons with indwelling urinary catheters. When a Resident Has a Rash or Skin Lesions When a resident has a rash on his/her body or sk in lesions, it could be due to any num ber of causes. A critical index of suspicion is essentia l to determ ine whether the rash is sim plex, scabie s, syphilis, petigo, a drug reaction, or due to any num ber of other conditions. The m ost im portant intervention f or rashes or skin lesions is use of appropriate protective barrier precauti ons (e.g.: gloves and possibly gown) followed by describing the rash to the resident' s physic ian so appropriate testing can be perform ed and/or a diagnosis be obtained. In m any cases, prom pt recognition of the rash, identification Section 3.0 Body Substance Precautions Subsection 3.4 Exam ples of Situations For Body Substance Precautions INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FO R LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES of the cause, and prom pt appropriate interv ention can prevent transm ission to the care provider and others. Gloves and gown should be worn when caring for persons with a rash caused by a com municable condition. Suctioning Residents With the BSP system , each facility staff m ember needs to evaluate his/her suctioning practices. Eye protection and m asks should be used only if splashing is likely to occur. Most persons who suction residents frequently have learned how to position their heads so that they are not splashed. Suctioning of a resident' s airway should ALWAYS be done with the care provider wearing gloves on both hands. In a ddition, if a care provider puts hands into a resident' s mouth for ANY reason, (e.g., for exam ination or when doing m outh care), gloves should be worn followed by handwashing after glove rem oval. Starting Intravenous Therapy Infusions or Draw ing Blood A person starting intravenous therapy, draw ing blood, or perform ing fingersticks should wear gloves. The m ajor risk in starting IV' s and drawing blood is a needle stick injury. W hen starting and discontinuing IV therapy, it is the discontinuing that is the lesser of the controlled procedures and has the greater potential for blood exposure. Careful needle handling is the m ost im portant factor in this interaction. Generally, needles should not be recapped, and never bent, or broken by hand, but s hould be discarded directly into the needle disposal containers. The \"one-handed recappi ng technique\" should be used in situations where recapping is necessary. Needle-recapping devices should be used when recapping is necessary. Manipulating Stopcocks A person who m anipulates stopcocks on a regul ar basis often gets blood on his/her hands during such m anipulations. If getting blood on the hands is the usual experience for the individual, gloves should be worn for m anipul ating stopcocks. It is wise to develop a standard practice of wearing gloves to m anipulate stopcocks and lines because it is difficult to do so without getting blood on the hands. Section 4.0 Collection and Transport of Laboratory Specimens Subsection: Table of Contents INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FO R LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES COLLECTION AND TRANSPORT OF LABORATORY SPECIMENS TABLE OF CONTENTS 4.0 Collection and Transport of Laboratory Specimens 4.1 Procedures for Specim en Collection and Transport Safety Considerations General Recom mendations Section 4.0 Collection and Transport of Laboratory Specimens Subsection 4.1: Procedures for Specim en Collection and Transport INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FO R LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES COLLECTION AND TRANSPORT OF LABORATORY SPECIMENS Procedures for Specimen Collection and Transport Laboratory results for your residents are contingent on the quality of the sam ple taken and proper adherence to transport directions. Poorly collected or transported specim ens will lead to im proper or delayed treatm ent for your resident. It is im perative that your contract laboratory provides your facility with com plete guidelines for proper collection and transport of specim ens. These guidelines m ust be available and used by all the professional staff in your facility. Safety Considerations Follow OSHA bloodborne standards. Observe Universal Precautions or BSP guidelines when collecting patient specim ens. Treating all specim ens as potentially hazardous eliminates the need for special considerations or warning labels. Do not contam inate the external surface of the collection/transport device or the accom panying paperwork. Minim ize direct handling of the specim en from the resident to the laboratory by utilizing transport system s, such as sealable plastic bags, provided by your laboratory. General Recommendations Consult with contract laboratory for specifi c collection procedures and devices, holding, and transport requirem ents. Obtain cultures prior to initiation of antibio tic therapy OR after residents or personnel have been off antibiotics at least 48 hours, preferably longer. Every specimen submitted to a laboratory mu st be labeled w ith at least the patient name, source of specimen (specific site of specimen), date, and time of collection of specimen. In addition, com pletely fill out the test request form . The nam e on the specim en m ust m atch the nam e on the request form . Include any specific requests/organism s the laboratory is to test for. Utilize sterile equipm ent and aseptic techni que to m inimize contam ination with norm al flora. W hen a specim en is to be collected through intact skin, cleanse the skin first. Cleanse the puncture site with alcohol follo wed by iodine which is allowed to dry and then wiped off with alcohol. Do not palpate this site following antiseptic cleansing. Section 4.0 Collection and Transport of Laboratory Specimens Subsection 4.1: Procedures for Specim en Collection and Transport INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FO R LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES Collect adequate am ounts of the specim en to elim inate false negative results. Select the correct anatom ic site from which to obtain the specim en and use the proper supplies and technique to collect the specim en. If in doubt, consult the laboratory or their manual for proper technique, and transport c ontainer. The following are som e suggested site-specific recom mendations. Do not follow them if they are in conflict with your laboratory instructions. 1. Routine Nasal Culture Culture the anterior nares onl y. One swab m ay be used for both nares. If the swab is m oistened with sterile nonbacteriostatic saline, gently roll the swab for 2-3 seconds over the area to be cultured. If swab is dry, rub area m ore vigorously. Place swab in culturette contai ner and crush am poule of transport m edia to ensure the swab stays wet. Do not refrigerate swab. 2. Throat Culture Instruct resident to breathe thr ough his/her m outh as this will lessen gagging. Utilizing a tongue blade and sterile swab, sam ple the back of the throat between and around the tonsillar area including any white or inflam ed areas. Avoid cheeks, teeth, etc. In general, swabs for vira l culture should be refrigerated if delay in transport is anticipated. 3. Nasopharyngeal Culture A nasopharyngeal wire swab should be passed along the floor of the nose posteriorly until it contacts the posterior pharyngeal wall. This should be accom plished with the neck in an extended position. The swab should be rotated several tim es and rem oved. It should be placed in an appropriate transport container/conveyance and delivered, as instructed, to the laboratory. (Transport media is only appropriate for bacterial cultures.) 4. Skin Consult your laboratory m anual for com plete directions when perform ing skin scrappings to test f or scabies. How to perf orm skin scraping is also outlined in \"Guidelines for Scabies Prevention and Contro l,\" Appendix J. Specim ens of skin, hair or nails for fungal culture can be subm itted in a sterile, screw cap container. 5. Sputum A first m orning, deep cough is recom mended. Attem pt to m inimize contam ination with saliva. Have resident brush teeth and gargle prior to collection. Rem ove dentures. 6. Ear Best results will be obtained if the ear is actually draining. Gently rotate swab in affected ear. 7. Eye Swabs for culture should be taken prior to application of topical antibiotics. Sample both eyes by rolling separate swabs prem oistened with sterile nonbacteriostatic saline over each conjunctiva. Section 4.0 Collection and Transport of Laboratory Specimens Subsection 4.1: Procedures for Specim en Collection and Transport INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FO R LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES 8. Wounds and Abscesses Tissue or fluid obtained from a site are superior to swab specim ens. \u00be Surface W ounds : W hen collecting surface wound cultures, first wipe off superf icial drainage with sterile saline m oistened gauze then sam ple the depths or leading edge with a swab. Avoid areas where healing has occurred. If necessary, open the lesion and express exudate onto a st erile swab. If a sinus tract is to be cultured, collect specim en as close to the ba se of the tract as possible. The tract opening should be wiped with a suitable antiseptic such as alcohol and allowed to dry. Rem ove accum ulated purulent drainage from the tract using sterile saline soaked 4 x 4 dressing. \u00be Deep W ounds : Deep wounds m ay contain anaerobic organism s that require special transport conditions. Consult your laboratory m anual for appropriate collection of a deep wound sam ple. Anaerobic organism s will not survive in routine culturettes. \u00be Abscesses : Use a needle and syringe to aspira te the fluid. Consult your laboratory manual for special transport conditions. Sp ecim ens collected by needle aspirate should be transported to a sterile container or appropriate transport vial and the needle and syringe disposed in com pliance with OSHA requirem ents. W hen there is little m aterial, a sm all am ount of sterile saline can be drawn into the syringe prior to transf erring the specim en to a sterile container. Never transport a specim en in a syringe without rem oving the needle. If transfer to another container will com promise the specim en, remove and properly dispose of the needle, and cap the syringe with a sterile cap prior to transporting the specim en to the laboratory. 9. Urine All urine specim ens, clean, voided or cat heterized m ust be collected in a sterile container or urine transport tube . Early m orning, clean voided specim ens are best. W hen collecting a urine specim en from a catheterized patient, collect the urine from the catheter line. Do not culture Foley catheter tips. If urine cannot be transported to the laboratory im mediately, it m ay be held in the refrigerator for up to four hours or placed in a urine transport tube with preservative. Urine specim ens that do not adhere to transport tim es and conditions will provide com promised results and may be rejected by your laboratory as unsatisfactory for testing. The date and time of collection are required on urine specim ens. 10. Feces Antibiotics, barium , and m ineral oil are toxic to bacteria so stool specim ens need to be obtained prior to their adm inistration. Collect liquid or sem i-liquid stool whenever possible. Collect in a clean or sanitized bedpan. Do not contam inate the feces with urine. If infecting organism is unknow n (i.e., an outbreak), collect tw o specimens. One specim en for bacterial testing, wh ich is placed in transport m edia, and one for viral testing, NOT placed in transport m edia. Fecal specim ens m ust be placed in different collection vials depe nding on the suspected infecting organism . Feces for som e viruses and bacteria m ust be collected without transport m edia.

Transport containers for bacteria a nd parasites are NOT interchangeable. Consult your laboratory m anual for appropriate transport conditions. A single negative stool culture or exam ination for ova and parasites cannot be accepted as sufficient to disregard a particul ar gastrointestinal pathogen as a potential cause of illness. Most infectious diarrh eas will be diagnosed with careful and extensive evaluation of three stool specim ens. Dem onstrations of toxins: immunologic or ethods are the preferred proof that Clostridium difficile is the observed clinical disease. Follow the laboratory' s instructions for C. difficile toxin specim en collection. 11. Rectal Swabs Swab should be inserted just inside the anus and rotated with firm pressure. On withdrawal it should be pl aced in a screw cap tube containing a preservative such as Cary Blair m edia. Rectal swabs are not recommended for detecting asym ptom atic carriers of Salmonella , Shigella or Campylobacter . Swabs are not acceptable for ova and parasites. 12. Blood The laboratory should provide the facility w ith commercial collection kits and blood culture bottles. Follow collection and transport directions very carefully. The specim en should be taken when the patient' s temperature is on the rise. Blood cultures are to be drawn at least one half hour apart with a total of three cultures in 24 hours. The specim ens m ust be labeled with collection tim es, date and the patient' s nam e. Suggested Steps for Obtaining Blood Cultures: (Please consult and follow your own laboratory-specific instructions.) Ob tain supplies. W ash hands for one full minute using an antiseptic soap. W ipe hands with alcohol swab. Apply tourniquet and select venipuncture site, then release tourniquet. Arrange sterile gloves and prep m aterials on a sterile field. Degrease the site using 70% isopropyl al cohol, rubbing in concentric circles starting at the center and m oving outward, applying firm but even pressure. Prep the venipuncture site with 2% tincture of iodine (preferred) or povidone iodine in concentric circles, allowing the iodine solution to rem ain for 60 seconds. Prep the tops of the blood culture bottles, also, using fresh iodine preps. Use 70% isopropyl alcohol to rem ove th e excess iodine from the venipuncture sites and tops of the bottle(s). Allow the alcohol to dry. Apply the tourniquet, then don sterile gloves, palpate the vein and draw approxim ately 10 to 20 m l of blood with a syringe and needle. Use alternate arm s for m ore than two blood culture collections. Divide 10-20 m ls evenly between bottle and unvented thiol bottle. Transport to the laboratory im mediately. DO NOT REFRIGERATE. Section 4.0 Collection and Transport of Laboratory Specimens Subsection 4.1: Procedures for Specim en Collection and Transport INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FO R LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES 13. Intravascular (IV) Catheter Specim ens Intravascular (IV) catheters are an important potential source of bacterem ia and fungem ia as well as local infectious complications at sites of catheter inser tion. Quantitative culturing of catheter tips is useful in assessing the relationship between catheters and sepsis. A positive catheter tip culture alone is not indicative of an IV related infection. Correlation of these results m ust be m ade with both blood cultures and the patient's clinical picture. Procedure for obtaining a catheter tip culture: \u00be Obtain supplies and wash hands. \u00be Cleanse skin around catheter site with alcohol. \u00be Don sterile gloves and aseptically rem ove th e catheter. W ith sterile scissors, clip 5 cm of the distal tip of the catheter and put directly into a sterile tube. Do not place in liquid m edia. \u00be Transport to the laboratory im mediately. If the physician orders anaerobic cultures, consult your laboratory for instructions. Specimens likely to contain anaerobic bacteri a must be collected and placed in an anaerobic device capable of maintainin g the viability of anaerobes. DO NOT REFRIGERATE. All specim ens m ust be prom ptly transporte d to the laboratory. Consult laboratory for specifics in storage requirem ents of specim ens prior to transport. REMEMER: Close attention to your labora tory's instructions for collecting and transporting laboratory specimens w ill in sure that your patient receives a rapid and accurate result. References 1.

Admission to Long Term Care Facility 1. Prior to the nursing hom e adm ission, the facility should request clinical inform ation from the transferring facility regarding current cultu re reports of the resident's body sites that may be infected or colonized with pathogeni c organism s, especially m ultiply resistant organism s. This action will enable the nursing staf f to determ ine the nursing care interventions necessary to m eet the resident 's needs.(See Figure 6.1-1 for an exam ple of a transfer form .) 2. The facility should also request clinical in form ation from the transferring facility to determ ine the resident's risk f actors f or colonization with m ultiply resistant organism s (i.e. long hospital stay, ICU stay). 3. The facility should review all pertinent c linical inform ation on the transfer form accom panying the resident upon adm ission to the facility. 4. The facility m ay not deny adm ission to a resident based upon the diagnosis of MRSA or any other m ultiply resistant organism or infectious disease, unless the long term care facility is unequipped to provide appropriate care f or the resident.2 Transfer to the Hospital or Another Long Term Care Facility 1. When transferring a long term care (LTC) resi dent to a hospital or another LTC facility, the facility coordinating the discharge should pr epare a transfer form and send it with the resident. The transfer form should show per tinent clinical data including the resident's medical history, diagnoses, presenting signs a nd sym ptoms, status of infectious disease (particularly m ultiply resistant organism s), appropriate culture reports/data, and current antibiotic therapy. (See Figure 6.1-1.) 2. The discharging facility should notify the admitting hospital or LTC facility by phone if laboratory data pertinent to the resident's clinical care is received after the resident's discharge. Such im portant inform ation would include: any abnorm al blood work; any positive culture report; Section 6.0 Transfer of Residents Subsection 6.1 Transfer of Residents Between Facilities INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FO R LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES inform ation that the resident had been exposed to an infectious disease outbreak in the LTC prior to transf er. Communication Betw een Facilities There should be open com munication between facilities perm itting the exchange of inform ation about the patient or resident. The LTC facility should notify the adm itting facility when a m ultiply resistant organism or com municable disease is identif ied on a resident recently discharged from the facility. The LTC facility should expect and request the same inf ormation of the f acility f rom which the resident was transf erred. This communication and cooperative action will perm it both facilities to track the patients/residents to identify potential com municable disease exposure. All inform ation exchanged m ust be handled in a m anner to m aintain the resident's conf identiality of medical care and treatm ent. Transfer agreements betw een facilities provide efficient mechanisms to formaliz e the appropriate content and methods for patient/resident information exchange. References 1.

An outbreak can be one case of a disease of unusual occurrence or public health im portance (i.e., tuberculosis, m eningococcal disease, m easles, streptococcal wound infection). Or an outbreak can be defined as three or m ore cases related by tim e, place and in the sam e population, OR two and one half tim es above the norm al incidence of new cases. An increase in disease or infection m ay involve one organism in several different body sites of multiple persons. An exam ple would be th e presence of the sam e antibiotic-resistant organism (MRSA, VRE) in the urine of persons with indwelling urinary catheters. Reporting Outbreaks Known or suspected outbreaks should be repor ted to your local public health agency, Departm ent of Health & Senior Services distri ct health office or the Missouri Departm ent of Health & Senior Services at (573) 751-6113 during working hours. Outbreaks of unusual virulence or of public health im portance can also be reported by calling (573) 751-4674 after hours, weekends or holidays. By reporting an increase in illness or infection early, a facility can receive assistance in Identifying the probable m ode of transm ission Reviewing appropriate barrier and isolati on precautions for im plem entation to prevent a large outbreak and/or the occurrence of serious health outcom es. Outbreak Checklist 1. Request Help. Call your local public health agency or the st ate Com municable Disease Control office at (573) 751-6113 for assistance with outbreak i nvestigation as soon as an outbreak is suspected. Specific prevention and/or control strategies are dependent upon the causative organism 2. Control the Outbreak (Confine and Contain) Enforce frequent and adequate handwashing. Use gloves and other barrier protections as indicated. Utilize airborne precautions if indicated. Restrict certain activities, depending on the suspected organism Section 7.0 Infectious Disease Outbreaks Subsection 7.1 Infectious Disease Outbreaks INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FO R LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES Keep persons with respiratory illness segregated. Consider the placem ent of sim ilarly infected persons together (sam e room or wing), if possible. Have specific staff designate d to care for infected/colonized residents only and avoid any contact with well residents. Confine wound drainage using appropriate dressings. Send ill em ployees hom e or do not allow them to return to work until asym ptom atic, or if required, negative cultures are obtained. 3. Initiate More Thorough Surveillance (Check for Additional Cases) The first cases of illness in a long-term care facility outbreak m ay be the m ost obvious. Many unrecognized cases m ight be uncovered by: 1. Observation of signs and sym ptoms 2. Review of chart docum entation 3. Creation of a line list of all residents w ith sym ptoms possibly associated with the illness and the organism (if known) 4. Identif ication of other inf ected cases in the f acility beginning with the nursing units where the first cases occurred. This process involves both clinical observations and chart review. Som e of the critical inform ation needed to describe the outbreak and analyze how and when the organism was transm itted are age, sex, tim e and date of disease onset, duration of and sequence of symptoms, resident room and nursing unit placem ent, and possible risk/m eans of exposure (room mate, dining room tablem ates, activities, degree of debilitation, treatm ents, invasive devices, other). 4. Start a Line Listing At a m inimum, identify each case by room num ber and wing location. The am ount and type of detail collected on each affected reside nt is determ ined by the severity/extent of the outbreak and the organism suspected to be the cause of the outbreak. Cultures m ay need to be collected as an integral pa rt of the outbreak surveillance. Request isolates/specim ens be saved for possible future testing. Rem ember to survey and create a line list of the f acility em ployees as well as the residents. 5. Inform Staff and Residents About Suspected or Know n Disease or Organism. Provide disease/organism fact sheet handout s to all concerned. Provide educational offerings on the organism and control m easures to all who need to know, such as facility staff, volunteers and f requent f acility visitors. 6. Complete and Send in Report When Outbreak is over Include the num ber of sym ptomatic cases versus total num ber exposed in both the resident and em ployee populations. Include copy of line list. Send report to your local public health agency or district health office, Attention: Epi Specialist.

Therefore, long term care facilities should develop an influenza outbreak prevention and control plan . The influenza outbreak control plan should be designed prior to the influenza season so that it can be implemented when a confirmed or suspected outbreak of influenza occurs. The ideal planning team should include the medical director, the director of nursing, the facility administrator, and the facility in fection control practitioner or the nursing staff professional responsible for facility infection control. The guidelines should be agreed upon prior to the influenza season. The following is an outline of the elements of an influenza plan. The planning team can evaluate each of the following elements and design particular strategies to prevent and control influenza for their long term care facility. PREVENTION 1. Develop an INSERVICE TRAINING program for facility staff on respiratory secretion precaution, handwashing techniques, and review the elem ents of the influenza control plan. Schedule the inservice training in September. 2. Initiate an INFLUENZA VACCINE PROGRAM for facility residents and staff that includes education on the importance of influenza vaccination. The optimal time for influenza vaccination for persons at high risk for influenza-related medical complications is between October to mid-November. The vaccine program should include a method to assess the vaccine status of new residents admitted and staff hired during the influenza season so they can be immunized if needed. 3. To prevent complications and morbidity, assess resident PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINE STATUS. Implement a plan to provide pneumococcal vaccine to residents who need it. (See Section 5. Immunizations.) 4. Establish and post at the nursing station the case definition for influenza-like illness : Fever (>100 \u00b0F oral or equivalent) AND at least two of the following: chills headache or eye pain muscle ache malaise or loss of appetite sore throat dry cough change in mental status. Section 8.0 Influenza Outbreaks Subsection 8.1 Influenza Outbreak Control INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES BE ALERT FOR THE FIRST SIGNS AND SY MPTOMS of the illness during the influenza season. (Smith's Outbreak definition: The presence of more than one case of influenza-like illness occurring in the same unit within two consecutive days .) 5. Develop a plan to obtain quick LABORA TORY CONFIRMATION to detect influenza type A. One confirmatory laboratory test, such as the Directigen EIA Flu A test, from one of a group of residents experiencing influenza-like illness is enough to determine the presence of influenza A and to initiate the influenza plan. 6. The facility should have a system develope d prior to the influenza season to quickly obtain physician orders for antiviral medicati on when influenza type A is detected. In addition, an agreement should be established with the facility pharmacy to quickly obtain the antiviral medications. CONTROL 1. Increase attention to respiratory and secretion precautions and always practice good handwashing. 2. Identify the symptomatic residents and begin line-listing cases, including resident identifiers, room, wing, onset date, symptoms, vaccine status, treatment, hospitalizations, and outcome. (See Figure 7.1-5 in Subsection 7.1 Infectious Disease Outbreaks) 3. Report outbreaks of influenza-like illness to your local public health agency or the Department of Health, ?. Department of Health staff can advise and assist with the implementation of an influenza control plan. Nosocomial outbreaks are a category I notifiable disease requiring reporting at first knowledge or suspicion. 4. Perform an influenza rapid-test accord ing to an established influenza plan. Report laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza to the Department of Health. 5. For influenza type A, consult the facility medical director for a decision regarding use of antiviral medications, especially for the high -risk residents and the staff responsible for their care. Antiviral medications can have side-effects, therefore, each resident's physician should be consulted for the medication order. If a decision is made to use antiviral medica tions for a given resident or staff member ill with influenza type A, begin medicati on within 48 hours of symptom onset and discontinue after 3-5 days of treatment or within 24-48 hours after disappearance of signs and symptoms. For outbreak control , antiviral medications need to be continued for at least 2 weeks or until one week after the end of the outbreak. Section 8.0 Influenza Outbreaks Subsection 8.1 Influenza Outbreak Control INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES 6. Screen staff for symptoms and DO NOT permit ill staff to work. Personnel should notify the facility of the natu re of the illness and those with fever, cough or other influenza-like illness symptoms should remain off work for 3-5 days from the onset of their clinical illness. Personnel with mild influenza-like illness can work , especially with residents already ill, but must wear a mask with direct resident contact and practice respiratory secretion precautions and vigorous handwashing techniques. 7. Implement symptomatic control therapy: bed rest or frequent naps, as tolerated; increased oral fluids such as sport beverages, antipyretics and analgesics, antihistamines and decongestants, bronchodilator therapy for residents with COPD. 8. Cohort cases to a wing or hall of the facility . Direct care nursing staff should be assigned to the cohort unit during the duration of th e outbreak. Provide antiviral chemoprophylaxis to consenting personnel staffing the outbreak unit and to all unvaccinated personnel providing direct resident care. Restrict all but essential personnel from entering the cohort area. Important support services such as respiratory, physical, and occupational therapy as well as chaplain, social service, and activity visits should be provided to the limit of the resident's tolerance. 9. Post the influenza outbreak control plan at the entrance of the facility and screen visitors and relatives for illness. Limit visitors for ill residents during the acute and communicable stages of illness. 10. Health care facilities receiving discharged or transferred residents should be informed that the resident is coming from a facility with an influenza outbreak. Health care facilities admitting residents to the facility should be notified that the facility has an influenza outbreak. The resident and the resi dent's family and physician should be given an opportunity to decide if admission to the facility should be delayed or reconsidered. OTHER OPTIONS The facility administrator in consultation with the infection control practitioner, the medical director, and the director of nursing may make a decision to close the nursing unit to all new admissions, discharge asymptomatic residents, and to cancel all appointments that are not medically related.

Many of the elderly were infected with tuberculosis years ago, with the tubercle bacilli dormant most of the time. When the initial infection occurs and the bacilli begin to multiply, the normal immune system can quickly ove rcome the problem. As the body ages, the immune system becomes less active, and othe r medical problems may develop which further increase the risk of tuberculosis infection beco ming active disease. If tuberculosis disease is in the lung, which is the most common site, the person may start coughing and expelling the organisms into the air. This can be especially devastating in a long-term care facility, where many susceptible elderly persons are sharing the same air. It is therefore important for each facility to have a tuberculosis control program in place. This must include the documentation of the tuberculos is status of each resident, staff member and volunteer of each long-term care facility. Th is can best be accomplished by screening residents on admission, and pre-employment and annual testing of employees and volunteers as outlined below. Recommendations for Residents All residents new to long-term care who do not have documentation of a previous skin test reaction >10mm or a history of adequate treatment of tuberculosis infection or disease, shall have the initial test of a Mantoux PPD two-step sk in test to rule out tuberculosis within one month prior to or one week af ter admission as required by Department of Health rule 19 CSR 20-20.100 (See Appendix E). If the initial result is 0-9mm, the second test, which can be given after admission, should be given at least one week and no more th an three weeks after the first test. The result of the second test is used as the baseline. Documentation of a chest x-ray ruling out active pulmonary tuberculosis within one month prior to admission, along with an evaluation to rule out signs and symp toms of tuberculosis, may be acceptable by the facility on an interim basis until the Mantoux PPD two-step test is completed. The two-step test is recommended due to the \"booster phenomenon,\" which can occur at any age, but is more pronounced with increased age. The body's response to tuberculin, (the antigen in PPD), once that response has been es tablished by infection with tuberculosis (or other mycobacteria), may gradually wane over the years. The initial test of two-step test may result in a falsely negative (0-9mm) reading. However, that initial test stimulates the body to respond normally to a subsequent test. This can cause confusion at a later time if the resident is skin tested either as a result of symptoms of tuberculosis disease or as a contact to a newly diagnosed infectious person. The \"boosted\" skin te st then may appear to be the result of new infection, which puts the individual at much higher risk of progressing to tuberculosis disease. Therefore, it is imperative to purposel y elicit this boosted response in all persons in whom it is important to know their tuberculosis status. Section 9.0 Tuberculosis Control Subsection 9.1 Screening for Tuberculosis in Long Term Care Facilities INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES Skin test results of >10 mm, whether documented in the re sident's medical history, obtained by the first test, or obtained by the second of th e two-step test applied by the facility, require a chest x-ray to rule out current tuberculosis disease. It is important to also perform an evaluation to determine if signs or symptoms of tuberculosis (unexplained weight loss, fever, persistent cough) are present. Once tuberculosis disease is ruled out, it is important to record the results of the skin test in millimeters (mm), in a prominent place on the resident's medical record. Including the skin test result at th e same place and in the same manner as the resident's allergies is appropriate. Tuberculosis infection may progress to infec tious tuberculosis disease and is therefore reportable to the Missouri Department of H ealth. See Figure 9.1-1 for a copy of the report form for tuberculosis infection. Since resident s will be sharing air w ith others who, because of their age and other medical conditions, ma y be more susceptible to infection with tuberculosis, consideration of a routine course of infection treatment that kills tubercle bacilli and prevents progression to disease is recommende d. This is especially important in infected persons of any age who have an increased risk of progressing to tuberculosis disease. Infected persons at increased risk to develop disease are: a) Persons with skin test reactions >5mm with no symptoms of tuberculosis and no documented history of an adequate course of antituberculosis medications but with fibrotic lesions noted on chest x-ray. b) Persons with skin test reactions >5mm with HIV infection and those with risk factors associated with HIV infection whose HI V status is unknown. Preventive therapy may be considered for HIV infected persons who have skin test reactions of <5mm in groups where the prevalence of tuberculosis is high. c) Close contacts of persons with newly di agnosed infectious tuberculosis who have skin test reactions of >5mm. d) Recent skin test converters ( >10mm increase within a 2 year period.) ALL children <4 years with a skin test reaction of >10mm are included in this group. e) Persons with skin test reactions >10mm and the following medical conditions: 1. Diabetes mellitus 2. Prolonged corticosteroid therapy (>15mg of Prednisone or equivalent daily for 2- 3 weeks) 3. Immunosuppressive therapy 4. Hematologic and reticuloendothelial diseases (i.e., leukemia or Hodgkin's disease) 5. IV drug users 6. End stage renal disease 7. Chronic undernutrition (i.e., intestinal bypass surgery, gastrectomy, chronic ulcer disease, chronic malabsorption syndrom e, chronic alcoholism, cancer of the oropharynx and upper GI tract) Section 9.0 Tuberculosis Control Subsection 9.1 Screening for Tuberculosis in Long Term Care Facilities INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES In addition, even in the absence of any of the above risk factors, the following persons with skin test readings >10mm are recommended for preventive treatment: (1) Foreign-born persons from Latin America, Asia, Africa (2) Medically underserved low income popul ations, including high-risk racial or ethnic minority populations, especia lly black, Hispanic, and native Americans (3) Residents, employees and volunteers of long-term care facilities, other health care facilities, schools and child-care facilities Annual skin tests for residents with documented results <10mm are not required, nor are annual chest x-rays for residents w ith documented skin test results >10mm. Staff persons must be constantly vigilant for signs and sympto ms of tuberculosis in residents, and obtain a chest x-ray and sputum specimens should such signs and symptoms appear. In addition, residents are to be evaluated, at least annually, to assure absence of signs and symptoms for tuberculosis disease. (See Figure 9.1-2.) Recommendations for Employees The results of annual tuberculin testing of employees in a long-term care facility are a good indicator of the extent of transmission of t uberculosis within that facility. The following occupationally-exposed persons should be tested at least annually: all employees, attending physicians and dentists, volunteers who spend >10 hours weekly in the facility, nursing and allied health personnel, students, instructors and other individuals in regular attendance within long-term care facilities. Every facility should have a tuberculosis surveillance program that includes the following procedures: 1. Initial Examination . Provide a tuberculin skin test (Mantoux, 5 tuberculin units (TU) of purified protein derivative (PPD)) to all employees during pre-employment procedures, unless a previous reaction >10mm is documented. If the initial skin test result is 0-9 mm, a second test should be given at least one week and no more than three weeks after the first test. The results of the second test should be used as the baseline in determining treatment and fo llow-up of these employees. The two-step test regimen is optional for employees with a history of negative skin tests within the last two years. A history of BCG (bacille Calmette-Gueri n) does not preclude an initial screening test, and a reaction of 10 mm or more should be managed as a tuberculosis infection. A chest x-ray examination should be provided for employees who have a skin test reaction >10 mm or who have symptoms compatible with pulmonary tuberculosis in order to determine the presence of current disease. 2. Repeat Tuberculin Skin Tests . The Department of Health rule states employees will be skin tested on an annual basis as a means of surveillance within a facility. Infection treatment is recommended for all inf ected employees, unless specifically contraindicated, to prevent them from developing disease and infecting others. Section 9.0 Tuberculosis Control Subsection 9.1 Screening for Tuberculosis in Long Term Care Facilities INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES Infected employees who are without diseas e and who do not complete a course of preventive therapy will need an individualized plan of surveillance. Those who are at high risk of developing disease, i.e. converters, should be assigned where they cannot expose small children, immunocompromised patients, and others for whom the consequences of infection may be especially serious. 3. Repeat Chest X-Ray . After the initial evaluation of persons with skin test reactions >10 mm, routine repeated chest x-rays are not recommended. They are not a substitute for infection treatment nor vigilance for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis disease. An annual sign and symptom review should be documented in their record. (See Figure 9.1-2.) Employees w ho have completed an adequate course of disease or infection treatment should be exempt from further chest x-rays unless they become symptomatic. 4. Reactors with Symptoms of Tuberculosis . All persons with significant reactions to the tuberculin skin test and symptoms of tube rculosis must seek a medical evaluation and be deemed non-infectious prior to returning to work. Persons with significant reactions and no symptoms of tuberculosis may start work prior to obtaining a chest x-ray as long as one is obtained as soon as possible. 5. Contact Investigations . When there is an exposure to a suspected or recently diagnosed case of tuberculosis, a contact investigation should be conducted. Each person exposed who previously had a negative reaction to the skin test should receive a tuberculin test. Those who are still negativ e should be retested three months after exposure. Preventive therapy should be given to high-risk contacts with negative skin tests since they may be infected even though their skin tests have not yet converted. Chest x-rays should be provided for employees whose skin test reactions increase >6 mm from <10 mm to >10 mm. Treatment for infection or disease should be provided according to the results of the x-ray. 6. Evaluation . The data generated from this testi ng should be analyzed periodically to determine and revise policies. The best inde x of the effectiveness of the program will be the absence of new infections in employees. Figure 9.1-2 DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURE: THE TUBERCULIN TEST FOLLOW-UP OF TUBERCULIN FOR TUBERCULIN REACTORS NAME: _____________________ DOB : _____________________ [ ] I am tuberculin positive. I have had the recom mended course of treatm ent for tuberculosis infection or disease. [ ] I am tuberculin positive.

This statem ent is to conf irm that I DO NOT have sym ptoms consistent with pulm onary tuberculosis such as: Cough lasting longer than three (3) weeks Unexplained fever Night sweats Unexplained weight loss Coughing up blood Chest pain If none of these symptoms are present, a chest x-ray is NOT NECESSARY. If I develop any of these sym ptoms, I agree to seek im mediate m edical attention. ___________________________________ _____________________ Signature DateSection 9.0 Tuberculosis Control Subsection 9.2 Guidelines for Tuberculosis Contact Investigation INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES TUBERCULOSIS CONTROL Guidelines for Tuberculosis Contact Investigation In Long Term Care Facilities The identification of an active case of tuberculos is in an employee, volunteer or resident of a long-term care facility may present some particularly difficult problems. Residents are usually elderly and therefore may be at greater risk of developing disease due to a recently acquired infection, as well as developing disease fr om a long-ago infection. This problem is compounded by the congregate living situation that potentially enhances the transmission of any communicable disease. In addition, tuberculosis may go unrecognized in debilitated elderly residents for months, resulting in prolonged exposure of a large number of staff and residents. It is important to \"THINK TB\". When a long-term care facility receives informa tion that an employee, volunteer or resident is diagnosed or suspected of tuberculosis, the facility should report to the local health unit. This report (See Figure 9.2-1) is required by Mi ssouri Department of Health rule, 19 CSR 20-20.020. Reporting Communicable Diseases (See A ppendix I). In addition to receiving the report, the local health unit will provide assist ance in conducting the contact investigation as well as in obtaining antimycobacterial drugs, if de sired. (In the absence of a local health unit, the district health office provides these services.) Generally, the local or district health unit will conduct the investigation according to the following recommended procedures: 1. An estimate of how long the person was sy mptomatic and infectious will be made according to established criteria. It is important to remember that, because tuberculosis is transmitted by the airborne route, persons who sleep, live, work, or who are otherwise in contact with an infectious person through a common ventilation system for a prolonged time are \"close contacts\" at risk of acquiring infection. 2. The investigators will immediately arrange for tuberculin skin testing (Mantoux 5TU PPD) of the close contacts, including family members, friends, roommates, residents, and employees in the wing where the resident liv ed or the employee worked. This should be performed unless contacts have documenta tion of a prior skin test reaction >10mm. (If two-step testing was not done at time of ad mission or employment, it may be done at this time.). If there is no evidence of recent inf ections (as evidenced by skin test reactions >5 mm) among these close contacts, it is appropriate to not extend the investigation at this time. If there is evidence of recent infection, the investigation should be broadened to include others who may have been in less close contact. A repeat tuberculin test should be performe d on contacts with reactions of <5mm three months after exposure has ended. At the time of the repeat testing, if there is evidence of recent infection, it may be appropriate to exte nd the investigation to those with less close contact to the index case. Section 9.0 Tuberculosis Control Subsection 9.2 Guidelines for Tuberculosis Contact Investigation INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES Chest x-rays should be performed on all contacts whose skin test reaction is >5mm in order to rule out progressive disease. All sy mptomatic individuals, regardless of skin test results, should have a chest x-ray and s putum specimen submitted for AFB smear and culture. Skin test, x-ray, and sputum (if done) results should be recorded in each resident's chart or volunteer or employee record with other important medical information. Skin test results should be recorded in millimeters of induration, (e.g., 16mm or 0mm), rather than simply \"positive\" or \"negative.\" 3. After the initial round of close contact skin te sting and chest x-rays have been completed and results recorded in each resident's char t or the volunteer or employee record, staff and residents should be evaluated for the need for isoniazid (INH) infection treatment, following the guidelines of the American Thoracic Society and the Missouri Department of Health. The following persons associated with long-term care facilities are recommended for infection treatment regardless of age: a) Persons with skin test reactions >5mm with no symptoms of tuberculosis and no documented history of an adequate course of antituberculosis medications but with fibrotic lesions noted on chest x-ray. b) Persons with skin test reactions >5mm with HIV infection and those with risk factors associated with HIV infection whose HI V status is unknown. Preventive therapy may be considered for HIV infected persons who have skin test reactions of <5mm in groups where the prevalence of tuberculosis is high. c) Close contacts of persons with newly di agnosed infectious tuberculosis who have skin test reactions of >5mm. d) Recent skin test converters ( >10mm increase within a 2 year period.) ALL children <4 years with a skin test reaction of >10mm are included in this group. e) Persons with skin test reactions >10mm and the following medical conditions: Diabetes mellitus Prolonged corticosteroid therapy (>15mg of Prednisone or daily for 2-3 weeks) Immunosuppressive therapy Hematologic and reticuloendothelial diseases (i.e., leukemia or Hodgkin's disease) IV drug users End stage renal disease Chronic undernutrition (i.e., intestinal bypass surgery, gastrectomy, chronic ulcer disease, chronic malabsorption syndrom e, chronic alcoholism, cancer of the oropharynx and upper GI tract) f) In addition, even in the absence of any of the above risk factors, the following persons with skin test readings > 10mm are recommended for preventive treatment: Section 9.0 Tuberculosis Control Subsection 9.2 Guidelines for Tuberculosis Contact Investigation INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES Foreign-born persons from Latin America, Asia, Africa Medically underserved low income popula tions, including high-risk racial or ethnic minority populations, especially black, Hispanic, and native Americans Residents, employees and volunteers of long-term care facilities, other health care facilities, schools and child-care facilities Other Considerations Regard ing Tuberculosis Control in Long Term Care Facilities 1. All persons being treated for tuberculosis in fection or disease must be monitored monthly for signs and symptoms of adverse reacti ons. Each person also should be taught the symptoms of an adverse reaction to the medica tion(s) he is taking, and what to do if such symptoms occur. It is important that all persons being treated for tuberculosis infection or disease have appropriate baseline liver function tests and other tests which can be compared with subsequent studies should a suspected a dverse reaction occur. Abnormal findings on baseline studies must be followed up. For persons taking only isoniazid (INH) for in fection treatment, it is recommended that they have careful monthly monitoring of signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, dark urine, icterus, persistent fatigue or weakness). Liver enzymes should be monitored if symptoms develop as well as monthly if person is aged 35 or greater. 2. Residents being treated for tuberculosis in fection or disease should have their anti-TB drug regimens incorporated into the facility 's routine for medication delivery and should be given by a staff person trained to monitor for signs and symptoms of drug toxicity. If such occur, the anti-tuberculosis medica tions should be withheld and the physician notified immediately. 3. A resident, employee or volunteer who can not or will not complete a recommended course of INH should be couns eled to watch for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis disease (persistent cough, anorexia, fever, we ight loss) and counseled to seek medical attention immediately if symptoms occur. A notation should be made on the front of the medical or employee record along with the skin test reading and chest x-ray results if a recommended course of INH was not comp leted. Those who are at high risk of developing disease should not be where they can expose others for whom the consequences of infection may be especially serious. Repeated chest x-rays are not justified and are ineffective as a means of follow-up for these individuals. These persons should be screened annually for tubercul osis symptoms with screening results documented in their file. However, if th e person develops symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis, the person should then be examin ed by chest x-ray and sputum specimens to rule out disease. 4. Elderly persons who are on numerous medicati ons also need to be monitored for drug interaction with INH. Drug interactions ha ve been reported in patients taking phenytoin (Dilantin); INH potentates phenytoin toxic ity; phenytoin dosage should be reduced and Section 9.0 Tuberculosis Control Subsection 9.2 Guidelines for Tuberculosis Contact Investigation INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES serum levels monitored in patients receiving INH. Interactions with aluminum hydroxide, cycloserine, disulfiram (Antabuse), sodium blockers, theophylline and levodopa have also been reported. If the facility has any questions regarding tuberculosis control measures, please contact the local health department or the Section of Vaccine-Preventable and Tuberculosis Disease Elimination at the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services.

Section 9.0 Tuberculosis Control Subsection 9.3 Transfer of Residents with Suspected or Confirmed TB INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES TUBERCULOSIS CONTROL Transfer of Residents With Suspected or Confirmed Tuberculosis Residents with suspected or confirmed active pulmonary tuberculosis will be transferred to a facility with appropriate tuberculosis isolation facilities. All personnel with resident contact will have a single baseline tuberculosis skin test (Mantoux) and a medical history taken when hired. These personnel should also receive initial training about tuberculosis and the facilities policies and procedures. This training should be repeated annually. In order to deal effectively and efficiently with residents with suspected or confirmed tuberculosis the following procedures should be implemented. Early Identification of Residents With Suspected or Confirmed Pulmonary Tuberculosis Residents with signs and symptoms of active pulmonary tuberculosis (i.e., fatigue, night sweats, fever, unexplained weight loss, ch ronic and productive cough, hemoptysis and/or chest pain) should be cared for as though the resident has tuberculosis until it is ruled out. Exposure Determination The resident should be attended to by as small a number of health care providers as possible. All of those providing care to the resident afte r it is determined that the patient may have infectious pulmonary tuberculosis MUST BE TRAINED regarding the proper procedures to follow. (See Subsection 9.4 Instructions for Facilities Equipped to Manage Patients With Suspected or Confirmed Tuberculosis.) All pe rsonnel who may have had an exposure to the resident during a time when the patient may have been infectious should notify their supervisor of the possible exposure. This will be helpful later if the resident is found to have pulmonary tuberculosis. A list of those exposed will facilitate appropriate contact investigation. Masking and Segregation Tuberculosis is transmitted by the airborne route only. The patient will need respiratory precautions in addition to Body Substance Precau tions. When a resident is suspected of having active pulmonary tuberculosis and is not respiratory compromised, it is preferable to place a surgical mask on the resident and to segregate him/her in a PRIVATE ROOM until the transfer occurs. As long as the resident is wearing a surgical mask, there is no need for the staff to wear respiratory protection. (REAS ON: The surgical mask will cause the patients secretions to be expelled onto the surface of th e mask. Thus large droplets are trapped on the mask and droplet nuclei are not expelled into the air.). Section 9.0 Tuberculosis Control Subsection 9.3 Transfer of Residents with Suspected or Confirmed TB INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES If the resident cannot tolerate the placement of a surgical mask, a cough suppressant may be considered and/or the resident is to cover his/her mouth with a disposable tissue when needing to cough AND all persons/personnel in the area must wear N-95 or HEPA masks. Transfer The facility to which the resident is being tran sferred should be contacted and advised of the resident's diagnosis. The transfer should take place in an expeditious manner and long delays should be avoided. This will assist in keepi ng the number of possible exposures to other residents and staff to a minimum. Those pr oviding transportation (e.g. ambulance, police, private vehicle, etc.) should be advised of th e resident's status and provided appropriate infection control instructions. If the transfer is delayed, place resident in a room with plenty of sunshine and where a window can be opened. Place a fan pointing outwa rd in the window to create negative air pressure. The window should not open to another room or be near an intake vent for the facility. An alternative, if feasible, is to place the resident outside on a porch. Recordkeeping The facility will maintain reco rds on the results of all baseline skin testing and medical history on personnel with resident contact and w ill keep records on the results of skin tests performed on exposed employees. Prophylaxis All personnel who convert their PPD skin test should be promptly provided a medical evaluation and prophylactic medication, when appr opriate, to reduce their risk of acquiring tuberculosis. (See Subsection 9.2 Guidelines for Tuberculosis Contact Investigation in Long Term Care Facilities) Section 10.0 Infectious Disease Fact Sheets Subsection 9.4 Residents With Suspected or Confirmed Tuberculosis INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES TUBERCULOSIS CONTROL Instructions for Facilities Equipped to Manage Residents With Suspected or Confirmed Tuberculosis An effective tuberculosis (TB) control plan requires early identification, isolation and effective treatment of persons who have active tuberculosis. Early Identification Physicians and nurses must have a high index of suspicion regarding tuberculosis. Any resident with signs and symptoms of active t uberculosis, such as night sweats, fever, cough, or hemoptysis, should be treated as though they have TB until it is ruled out. In addition, all new residents are to have a tw o-step PPD skin test performed upon admission to the facility as required by Department of Health rule 19 CSR 20-20.100 (See Appendix E) Treatment/Discharge The appropriate treatment of tuberculosis will a ssist in patient recovery and in decreasing the risk of the development of antibiotic resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis . To assist the physician in assuring patient compliance in taking their medications proper discharge planning from an acute care setting should include collaboration with public health authorities. The Department of Health must be notified of suspected or confirmed cases of tuberculosis prior to discharge from the f acility to assure proper coordination of the discharge. Isolation/Stop Sign Alert Residents with suspected or confirmed TB should be immediately separated from other residents and placed in a separate area or an isolation room with negative air pressure. Residents should be placed on \"S top Sign Alert\" status in a private room equipped with negative air pressure and 6-12 air exchanges pe r hour. A \"Stop Sign Aler t\" sign is placed on the front of the door. Those caring for the patie nt and those entering the room of a patient with suspected or confirmed tuberculosis must wear appropriate respiratory protection (N-95 or HEPA mask). The patient should be give n a surgical face mask, a box of tissues and instructions regarding the use of these items . A surgical face mask should be placed on the patient for transportation or when they cannot immediately be taken to an appropriate isolation area. (See Precautions for Residents With Airborne Diseases in Subsection 3.2 Implementing the Body Substance Precautions Systems) Residents placed in Stop Sign Aler t with suspected tuberculosis should remain in isolation until TB is ruled out. Stop Sign Alert should be discontinued only when another diagnosis is confirmed or the patient has had: 1. Adequate chemotherapy for at least 2-3 weeks Section 10.0 Infectious Disease Fact Sheets Subsection 9.4 Residents With Suspected or Confirmed Tuberculosis INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES AND 2. Clinical and bacteriologic response to therapy, such as: reduction in cough resolution of fever progressively decreasing quantity of bacilli on smear. Most experts agree that the non-infectiousness in pulmonary TB can be established with negative acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smears on three consecutive days for a patient on effective therapy. A single negative smear is not adequate. At least three negative smears are necessary to achieve 95% sensitivity. THE INFECTION CONTROL COORDINAT OR MUST BE NOTIFIED BEFORE ISOLATION IS DISCONTINUED ON THESE RESIDENTS. The ventilation systems in rooms for isolati ng residents with suspected or confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis will be routinely m onitored to assure the rooms remain under negative pressure and that there is sufficient ai r exchanges. When in use, these rooms will be monitored daily to assure the system is functioning properly. High-Hazard Procedures Procedures performed on individuals with suspect ed or confirmed tuberculosis in which the potential for being exposed to M. tuberculosis due to the reasonable anticipated generation of aerosolized M. tuberculosis are classified as high-hazard procedures. These procedures include but are not or other medications pulmonary function testing. autopsy All high-hazard procedures performed on i ndividuals with suspected or confirmed tuberculosis shall be conducted in a room, area or environment that has negative air pressure and is either exhausted directly to the outside or recirculated through a HEPA filter. All persons performing high-hazard procedures must wear respiratory protection (N-95s as a minimum) except when procedures are performed in an isolation chamber, which separates the health care worker, form the patient and his/her air. Health Care Worker Monitoring and Training All staff who provide care to residents with suspected or confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis must: 1. Receive PPD skin testing at least annually. Skin testing may be done at more frequent intervals if deemed necessary Section 10.0 Infectious Disease Fact Sheets Subsection 9.4 Residents With Suspected or Confirmed Tuberculosis INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES 2. Receive annual training regarding the epidemiology and prevention of tuberculosis. 3. Receive training regarding the appropriate use of respiratory protection. Exposure Management Any person who may have had exposure to a patient with confirmed tuberculosis prior to the diagnosis and implementation of proper isola tion and respiratory protection should notify their supervisor. When residents enter the facility and are later diagnosed with infectious pulmonary tuberculosis, the facility will perform an investigation and notify possibly exposed staff. Baseline PPD skin tests will be performed on those who have not had a recent PPD skin test for TB and will then be followed up with a repeat skin test in 3 months. Any staff member who converts their PPD skin test should be managed medically with appropriate treatment, evaluation, care and follow-up. (See Subsection 9.2 Guidelines for Tuberculosis Contact Investigation in Long Term Care Facilities)Section 10.0 Infectious Disease Fact Sheets Subsection: Table of Contents INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES INFECTIOUS DISEASE FACT SHEETS TABLE OF CONTENTS 10.0 Infectious Disease Fact Sheets 10.1 Clostridium difficile Diarrheal Disease 10.2 Conjunctivitis (Pink Eye, Sticky Eye) 10.3 Head Lice Infestation (Pediculosis) 10.4 Hepatitis A 10.5 Hepatitis B 10.6 Hepatitis C 10.7 Influenza 10.8 Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 10.9 Scabies Fact Sheet Subsection 10.1 Clostridium difficile Diarrheal Disease INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES INFECTIOUS DISEASE FACT SHEETS Clostridium difficile Diarrheal Disease What b acterium that produces two exotoxins responsible for the development of gastrointe stinal (GI) illness (colitis) generally following administration of antibiotics. Because of the b acterium's ability to form spores, it can persist in the environment for months and is highly resistant to cleaning. It is also called antibiotic associated diarrhea (AAD) and/or pseudomembranous colitis. Who gets Clostridium difficile diarrheal disease? Clostridium difficile is common in soil, hay, mud, sand, and the stools of multiple animal species and is an opportunistic pathogen in ma n. Persons at greatest risk for acquiring this disease include those who require the administ ration of antibiotics (especially I.V., broad- spectrum antibiotics), have their bowel flor a disrupted as a result of enemas or gastrointestinal surgery, are hospitalized (esp ecially in intensive care units), are receiving enteral feedings, or are on drugs that affect the motility of the gastrointestinal tract (e.g.: narcotics, antacids, or laxatives). These cond itions change the normal bacterial flora of the bowel allowing Clostridium difficile to multiply and cause disease. What are the symptoms? Symptoms of Clostridium difficile diarrheal disease include: diarrhea (more than three loose stools/day for two or more days), abdominal cr amps, low grade fever, abdominal tenderness. Diarrhea is initially green or yellow-brown in color, and in prolonged or serious disease diarrhea becomes bloody. How soon do symptoms appear? The period of time from exposure to development of symptoms may be a few days to weeks. H ow is Clostridium difficile spread? Spores of Clostridium difficile can be acquired from the environment or by fecal-oral transmission (unwashed hands) from colonized or infected individuals (cases as well as persons providing medical care). How can Clostridium difficile be prevented? Handwashing is the single most important means of preventing transmission of this disease. Persons that soil the environment should be placed in a private room. Body Substance Precautions should be used. Single use of patient care items and good housekeeping practices are also important. Can Clostridium difficile be treated? Yes, the drug of choice is oral metronidazole (fla gyl). If flagyl fails, oral vancomycin should be added to the treatment regimen. If flagyl can not be used, then oral vancomycin should be given alone. Anti-diarrheal medications should NOT be given.Section 10.0 Infectious Disease Fact Sheet Subsection 10.2 Conjunctivitis (Pink Eye, Sticky Eye) INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES INFECTIOUS DISEASE FACT SHEET Conjunctivitis (Pink Eye, Sticky Eye) What is conjunctivitis? Conjunctivitis is an infection in the eye. It can be caused by bacteria or viruses. Who gets conjunctivitis? Anyone can get conjunctivitis. How is it spread? Conjunctivitis is spread when a person comes in contact with discharges from the eye or upper respiratory tracts of infected people. It can be sp read by contaminated fingers and articles (towels, wash cloths, multi-dose medication vials, eye makeup). What are the symptoms of conjunctivitis? One or both eyes may be red, itchy, painful, and may have drainage. In severe cases, the eyelid will be swollen. Care should be taken to assess the resident for history of allergies. How long is the person contagious? From the time of exposure until symptoms occur, usually 24-72 hours. The person can spread the infection to others as long as symptoms are present. How is conjunctivitis diagnosed? First an evaluation is made of the signs and symp toms and history of allergy. A culture may be obtained and sent for both bacterial and/or viral analysis. How do you treat conjunctivitis? Usually the physician will prescribe eye drops or ointment. How can conjunctivitis be prevented? Teach residents good personal hygiene habits. Care must be taken to assure personal items are not shared among residents. Care must also be taken to prevent multi-dose medication vials from becoming contaminated. Ideally, single dose vials are used. As usual, good handwashing applies. Residents should only be restricted to their room if they have conjunctivitis and poor hygiene habits. If this is the case, the resident should be restrict ed from participating in activities or going to the dining room only during the course of infection. For more information about conjunctivitis, ask your physician or health care provider, infection control professional, pharmacist or contact Missour i Department of Health and Senior Services.Section 10.0. Infectious Disease Fact Sheets Subsection 10.3 Head Lice Infestation (Pediculosis) INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES INFECTIOUS DISEASE FACT SHEETS Head Lice Infestation (Pediculosis) What are head lice? Head lice are blood-sucking insects that are found on people's heads. The head louse is found on the hair near the scalp, especially behind the ears and at the nape of the neck. Who gets head lice? Anyone, no matter how clean they are, who comes in close contact with someone whom already has head lice. How are head lice spread? Head lice can transfer quickly upon head-to-head contact or by way of bug-ridden clothing or personal care items (e.g.: combs, brushes, headwear). What are the symptoms? Itching and scratching of the scalp are seen. Pe rson may complain or notice a tickling feeling of something moving in the hair. Sores on th e scalp, caused by scratching, may also occur. These sores can sometimes cause a bacterial infection of the scalp. How soon do symptoms occur? It may take two to three weeks or longer before the itching is bothersome enough to cause concern. What do head lice look like? There are three forms of head lice: the nit, the immature head louse called the nymph and the adult head louse. Nits are head lice eggs that ar e firmly attached to the hair shaft. They are not to be confused with dandruff or hair spray droplets that can be removed easily by combing or brushing the hair. Live lice are the size of a sesame seed (smaller for the nymph) and color varies with the color of the person's hair. How long can a person spread head lice? Head lice can be spread as long as lice or nits remain alive on the infested person or clothing. Adult lice live up to 30 days on a person's head. Off a person, lice die within 2-3 days. Nits that fall off the hair do not hatch at or below room temperature and therefore do not play a major role in spreading head lice. Section 10.0. Infectious Disease Fact Sheets Subsection 10.3 Head Lice Infestation (Pediculosis) INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES How is head lice infestation diagnosed? By looking closely through the hair and scalp for nits or live lice. If lice are not seen, finding nits close to the scalp confirms the diagnosis of head lice. If you are not sure a person has head lice, consult a health care provider, school nurse or public health nurse. What is the treatment for head lice? Only those persons with live lice or nits close to the scalp and aged 2 or greater should be treated with a medicated shampoo or cream rins e. Many of these products may be purchased over the counter while others require a prescrip tion. Package instructions must be carefully followed and all require a second application if a ll nits are not removed from the hair. Use of lindane products is discouraged due to their potential to be toxic. Remove all nits from the hair. This can be done by picking the nits from the hair using the index finger and thumbnails or by using a special nit comb. If only a few hair follicles remain with nits present, these may be removed by cutting the hair shaft close to the scalp. All washable clothing and bed linens used by the infested person during the past 2-3 days require washing and drying on the \"hot\" cycle fo r at least 20 minutes. Dry clean clothing that is not washable or place clothing in a plastic bag, seal, and store for 14 days. Wash combs and brushes with soap and hot (130 \u00b0F) water. Vacuum floors and upholstered furniture. Use of sprays is not necessary and may be detrimental to those with allergies or asthma.Section 10.0. Infectious Disease Fact Sheets Subsection 10.4 Hepatitis A INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES INFECTIOUS DISEASE FACT SHEETS Hepatitis A What is hepatitis A? Hepatitis A is a liver disease caused by the he patitis A virus. It was formerly known as infectious hepatitis. It does not cause long te rm liver damage and usually does not cause death. With hepatitis A there is no chronic carri er state and people who have the disease will then be protected for life. Who gets hepatitis A? Anyone can get hepatitis A. Groups of people who are more susceptible to hepatitis A are children and adults between the ages of 15 to 30 years of age. People in these age groups are more socially active, and participate in activities that may involve sharing of food, beverages or other substances. They are also freque ntly employed in occupations such as food preparation and service, which could provide the opportunity to expose large numbers of people. In the long-term care setting, the empl oyee in food service with hepatitis A can pose the greatest threat to residents and staff. How is hepatitis A spread? Hepatitis A is spread through eating or drinking food or beverages that have been contaminated from hands soiled with stool c ontaining the hepatitis A virus. Since very few viral particles are needed to cause infection, visible soilage with stool is not necessary. Institution of proper handwashing procedures a nd proper disinfection of articles will prevent the spread of hepatitis A. What are the symptoms of hepatitis A? The symptoms of hepatitis A may include: tir edness, poor appetite, fever, vomiting, urine may become dark in color, stool may become clay color or jaundice (yellowing of skin and whites of eyes) may occur. Symptoms may be mild and not everyone who has hepatitis A will have all these symptoms. How soon do symptoms appear? They may appear within two to seven weeks af ter someone has been exposed to hepatitis A, but usually it is within four to five weeks. How is hepatitis A diagnosed? There is a blood test specific to hepatitis A that can confirm the diagnosis. How long can the infected person spread the virus? A person is contagious about two weeks before symptoms appear until about one week after jaundice occurs. If no jaundice is seen, consider the person contagious for two weeks prior to symptoms and two weeks after symptoms occu r (4 weeks). Persons with no symptoms can still spread the virus. Section 10.0. Infectious Disease Fact Sheets Subsection 10.4 Hepatitis A INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES How do you treat hepatitis A? There are no medications for hepatitis A. The be st treatment is rest and good nutrition. Drugs and alcohol should be avoided. How can hepatitis A be prevented? The best prevention is good handwashing after us ing the restroom. Sta ff caring for residents should use Body Substance Precautions a nd good handwashing. Equipment taken from resident to resident should be properly disinf ected. Utensils used for food preparation should be properly sanitized. Staff working in the food preparation should be evaluated for and symptoms indicative of hepatitis A. Hepatitis A vaccine is available and should be considered by the facility as part of their employee health policies. For more information about hepatitis A, ask your physician or health care provider, infection control professional, pharmacist or contact Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services.Section 10.0. Infectious Disease Fact Sheets Subsection 10.5 Hepatitis B INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES INFECTIOUS DISEASE FACT SHEET Hepatitis B What is hepatitis B? Hepatitis B is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis B virus. It was formerly called serum hepatitis. Who gets hepatitis B? Anyone can get hepatitis B, but persons at greatest risk include: Babies born to mothers who carry the virus Drug users who share needles Health care workers who come in contact with infected blood or body fluids which contain the virus Persons with multiple sex partners Hemodialysis patients Persons who receive unscreened blood products Household contacts and sexual partners of infected persons or carriers of hepatitis B Persons living in areas such as Asia or Africa where hepatitis B is common Persons in the U.S. who are Alaskan Natives or Pacific Islanders. How do people get this virus? The virus of hepatitis B may be found in blood and in lesser amounts in saliva, semen and other body fluids of people who are infected or ca rry the virus. It is spread from one person to another by sharing any of these body fluids th rough sharing of needles, needle stick injury, mucous membrane exposure, human bite or sexual contact. It is not spread by casual contact. What are the symptoms of hepatitis B? Like hepatitis A, some people may have no symptoms, a few symptoms or severe symptoms. The symptoms may be loss of appetite, tiredness, fever, vomiting, joint pain, hives or a rash. In more severe cases, the urine will turn a dark color, stool will turn a light (clay) color and the person will become jaundiced (a yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes). How soon do symptoms appear? Symptoms can appear anywhere between 45 a nd 180 days after exposure, with the average being 60-90 days. How is hepatitis B diagnosed? A blood test can be performed which is specific for hepatitis B. Section 10.0. Infectious Disease Fact Sheets Subsection 10.5 Hepatitis B INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES How long is the person contagious? Hepatitis B virus can be present for several weeks before symptoms appear and several months after symptoms appear. About 10% of people who get hepatitis B will become carriers and will always have the virus in thei r body fluids and can then transmit it to others in the ways identified above. What is the treatment for hepatitis B? There is no specific treatment for hepatitis B. Like hepatitis A, good nutrition and rest are very important. If someone becomes a carrier of hepatitis B, they may benefit from alpha- interferon. How can hepatitis B be prevented? Hepatitis B vaccine is available and is a safe vaccine that provides protection to about 90% of those who receive it. It is given in three in jections at 0, 1 and 6 months. A special hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) is also available fo r persons who are exposed and have not been vaccinated. In the long-term care setting as with any health care setting, all staff should practice appropriate precautions while providing care to residents. Care should be taken when handling any sharp object used on the resident. Care should also be taken to assure that personal items (razor, toothbrush) are not shar ed between residents. The resident who is either infected or is a carrier of hepatitis B may participate in activities and eat in the dining room. For more information about hepatitis B, ask your physician or health care provider, infection control professional, pharmacist or contact Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services.Section 10.0. Infectious Disease Fact Sheets Subsection 10.6 Hepatitis C INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES INFECTIOUS DISEASE FACT SHEET Hepatitis C What is hepatitis C? Hepatitis C is an inflammation of the liver th at is caused by the hepatitis C virus. This inflammation can result in serious liver damage . Eighty-five percent of hepatitis C-infected individuals develop chronic hepatitis. Hepatitis C is now the major reason for liver transplantation in the United States. How common is hepatitis C? Annually, approximately 30,000 Americans will b ecome infected with hepatitis C in the United States. If the body does not clear the virus in six months, the infection is said to be chronic. Currently, an estimated 4 million pe ople have chronic hepatitis C in the United States. Missouri is estimated to have 95,000 persons infected with hepatitis C. Each year, up to 8,000 Americans die from compli cations of hepatitis C. The death rate is expected to triple within the next 10 to 20 y ears, exceeding the death rate associated with AIDS. Who is at risk for hepatitis C? Hepatitis C is transmitted primarily by direct puncture of the skin. Injection drug use accounts for greater than 60% of chronic infections. Other risks include: Blood transfusion prior to 1992 Hemodialysis patients Practicing high-risk sexual activity (multiple partners history of STDs, co-infected with HIV) Using non-injection illegal drugs (intranasal cocaine) Occupational exposure (health care workers) Tattooing and body piercing with contaminated equipment Transmission between mother and baby has b een documented, although the risk is low, no more than 6%. Breastfeeding does not appear to transmit hepatitis C. What are the symptoms? Some people have loss of appetite, tiredness, nausea and vomiting, vague stomach pain and jaundice (a yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes). Some people do not have any symptoms. Section 10.0. Infectious Disease Fact Sheets Subsection 10.6 Hepatitis C INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES How soon do symptoms occur? Symptoms may occur from two weeks to six months after exposure but usually within 6-9 weeks. These symptoms are during the acute phase of the disease. Liver cirrhosis and permanent liver damage from hepatitis C may not be evident for up to 20 years after the initial exposure to the virus. When and for how long is a person able to spread hepatitis C? A person with hepatitis C is contagious one or two weeks before symptoms appear and during the entire time the person is ill. About 50% of the people with hepatitis C will go on to become chronic carriers. Until more is lear ned about this disease, all persons who have been diagnosed as having hepatitis C should be considered infectious (able to pass the hepatitis C virus through their blood and body fluids). What are the complications of hepatitis C? Eighty-five percent (85%) of persons infected with hepatitis C develop chronic hepatitis and remain infectious to other people. Cirrhosis (s carring of the liver) occurs within 2 years of the onset of infection in at least 20% of pe rsons with chronic hepatitis C. The risk for chronically infected persons to develop liver cancer is 1-5%. The course of illness is influenced by various factors, especially alcohol consumption. Can hepatitis C be prevented? There is no vaccine for hepatitis C. A healt hy lifestyle can reduce chances of infection. Avoid illegal injection drug use, intranasal co caine use and activities that involve contact with other people's blood. Practice safe se x and limit sexual partners (a monogamous relationship has the lowest risk for ac quiring hepatitis C). Avoid sharing razors, toothbrushes, pierced earrings, needles and syringes with anyone; and make certain needles for body piercing and tattooing have been properly sterilized. How is hepatitis C diagnosed? There are tests that can be performed on blood to identify individuals who have the hepatitis C virus. Your doctor can perform these tests. Is there a medical treatment for hepatitis C? Treatment for hepatitis C is recommended only in a selected group of infected persons. Vaccination against hepatitis A and B is recommended, since a liver compromised by hepatitis C is more susceptible to hepatitis A and B. For more information about hepatitis C, ask your physician or health care provider, infection control professional, pharmacist or contact Missouri Department of Health and Senior ServicesSection 10.0. Infectious Disease Fact Sheets Subsection 10.7 Influenza INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES INFECTIOUS DISEASE FACT SHEETS Influenza What is influenza? Influenza is a highly contagious respiratory illness caused by a virus. There are two main types of influenza viruses: type A and type B. Each type has many different subtypes or strains. Influenza, type A, causes moderate to severe illness. Type B causes milder disease and primarily affects children. Influenza can occur throughout the year, but seasonally peaks from December to March. What are the symptoms? Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, malaise, sore throat, runny nose, cough and nasal congestion. Occasionally, intestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain are present, but should not be confused with the \"stomach flu.\" How is influenza spread? Influenza is spread from person to person by dir ect contact with aerosolized particles or large droplets from the respiratory tract of the in fected person when coughing, sneezing, or talking. Transmission can also occur through articles recen tly contaminated by respiratory secretions of the infected person. Frequent handwashi ng and avoiding or limiting contact with an infected person may reduce the risk of infection. How soon do symptoms appear? Symptoms of influenza usually appear 1 to 5 days after exposure. How long can a person spread influenza? Persons are most contagious during the 24 hours before symptoms appear and may be contagious for up to 7 days. How is influenza diagnosed? The diagnosis of influenza is usually base d on the symptoms. For a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis, the virus should be cultured from the th roat or nose within three days of onset of symptoms. What is the treatment? Basic treatment includes bed rest, fluids, and over-the-counter medications for the relief of symptoms of runny nose, cough, sore throat, fe ver and discomfort. Aspirin should not be used for infants, children, or teenagers because of the associated risk for contracting Reye Syndrome. Antiviral medications, such as amantadine a nd rimantadine, may reduce the severity and shorten the duration of influenza, type A illness in healthy adults when administered with 48 hours of illness onset. These drugs can have side effects and must be ordered by your physician. How serious is influenza? Section 10.0. Infectious Disease Fact Sheets Subsection 10.7 Influenza INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES Influenza can be very serious, especially duri ng epidemics. Secondary bacterial pneumonia is a serious complication of influenza and can cau se death in persons at increased risk for complications, including the elderly and those with chronic diseases. Can influenza be prevented? Annual influenza vaccine immunization has been up to 90% effective in preventing influenza in young healthy adults and while only 30% to 40% effective in preventing illness among frail elderly persons, it is 80% effective in prev enting influenza-related deaths in the elderly. During community outbreaks of influenza, type A, antiviral medications may be used by persons who are unable to take the influen za vaccine. Antiviral medications are also indicated when outbreaks are caused by a variant st rain of influenza, type A, that might not be controlled by the vaccine. When is the influenza vaccine given? Influenza vaccine is updated annually to match the circulating strain and provides immunity for approximately one year. The vaccine shoul d be taken each fall, between October and mid-November. It takes about 1 to 2 week s for the antibody to develop and provide protection. Special split-virus influenza vaccine should be administered to children 6 months to 12 years. Children less than 9 years of ag e receiving influenza vaccine for the first time should receive two doses administered at least 1 month apart. How safe is influenza vaccine? The influenza vaccine does not contain live viru ses, so it cannot cause influenza. The most common reaction is soreness where the shot was given. Fever, chills, malaise, and muscle soreness, lasting 1 to 2 days, occurs in less than 1% of vaccine recipients. Who should get influenza vaccine? Persons who have a greater risk for developing complications from influenza should be vaccinated, including: Persons aged 65 years and older; Residents of long term care facilities and other chronic care facilities; Adults and children with chronic heart or lung conditions, including children with asthma; Adults and children who require regular medical follow-up because of chronic metabolic disease (including diabetes mellitus), kidney disease, blood disorders or immunosuppression; Children and teenagers, aged 6 months to 18 years, who are receiving long-term aspirin therapy and might be at risk for developing Reye syndrome after influenza; Women who will be in the second or third trimester of pregnancy during the influenza season. Other persons who should be vaccinated include: Persons who live with or care for high-risk individuals; Health care workers, physicians, staff and volunteers of health care facilities and home health facilities; Persons who work in public-safety occupations, such as, police, firefighter, and emergency medical technicians; College and university students and travelers to foreign counties; Section 10.0. Infectious Disease Fact Sheets Subsection 10.7 Influenza INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES Persons who wish to avoid influenza illness. Who should NOT get influenza vaccine? Persons who: Have had a severe allergic reaction to a vaccine component or following a prior dose; Have severe reactions, such as hives or swelling of the lips or tongue, after eating eggs because the vaccine is prepared from influenza viruses grown in eggs; Have a fever; Have an active infection. For more information about influenza, ask your physician or health care provider, infection control professional, pharmacist or contact Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services.Section 10.0. Infectious Disease Fact Sheets Subsection 10.8 Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES INFECTIOUS DISEASE FACT SHEETS Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) What is MRSA? This is the scientific name for a specific type of common bacteria ( Staphylococcus aureus) that has become \"resistant\" to or is no longer treatable by a group of commonly used antibiotics (e.g.: methicillin/oxicillin/other penicillin-like drugs). Why and how do bacteria change so antibiotics no longer work? Some bacteria already come equipped with th e ability to resist the effects of certain antibiotics. Other types of bacteria can acquire the resistant capability from these bacteria. Other types of bacteria get used to living in the presence of antibiotics when antibiotics are taken often, taken when not needed or taken in wrong dosages. The proper use of antibiotics is essential in preventing the emergence and number of resistant organisms. How harmful is MRSA? MRSA is not more harmful than methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. It is more difficult to treat due to usual antibiotics bei ng ineffective. MRSA infections are usually treated with stronger and more expensive antibiotics. How do you get MRSA? Many persons already have MRSA due to the pr evious use of antibiotics. When MRSA is present and causing no harm, a person is \"coloni zed\" with the organism. It is when this organism invades the blood, a wound, or othe r sterile body site, that it causes harm (infection). It may also be acquired within institutions where antibiotics are either given to the individual or are heavily used by others. Hands are the most likely means of transmi ssion of MRSA from one person to another. Transmission requires direct contact with a pers on either colonized or infected with MRSA. Although MRSA has been isolated from envir onmental items, the environment is NOT an effective mode of transmission. Should an MRSA colonized or infected person be denied admission to a facility? There is no reason to deny admission of a person colonized or infect ed with MRSA since there may be many residents currently in th e facility with unknown MR SA colonization of the skin, nares, urine, feces, or sputum. Section 10.0. Infectious Disease Fact Sheets Subsection 10.8 Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES What can and should be done to limit the spread of MRSA? HANDWASHING is the single most effective means of preventing MRSA transmission. When appropriate, gloves, gowns, masks, and protective eyewear are used as barriers to prevent acquisition and transmission of the organism. Persons should only take an antibiotic when a bacterial infection has been diagnosed. In addition, it is important the antibiotic is taken as prescribed with all pills taken. If side effects become a problem, the health care provider should be contacted so the dosage can be changed or an alternate antibiotic prescribed. What determines whether a resident with MRSA can leave his/her room and participate in social activities? Each resident should be assessed as to his/he r potential for spreading MRSA. A colonized or infected resident, whose wound drainage can be c ontained in a dressing (if applicable), is not physically ill with fever AND is compliant in following handwashing instructions and instructions not to touch the colonized or infected site, may participate in nursing home activities and eat in the dining hall. Can a resident use the tub or whirlpool if they have MRSA? Residents, regardless of colonization or inf ection with MRSA or any other organism, can take a tub bath or use the whirlpool. Effec tive cleaning and disinfection of the tub or whirlpool must take place following usage. Section 10.0. Infectious Disease Fact Sheets Subsection 10.9 Scabies INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES INFECTIOUS DISEASE FACT SHEETS Scabies What is scabies? Scabies is a highly communicable skin disease caused by tiny human mites that burrow under the skin to lay eggs. Scabies causes intense itching, and a red, generally raised skin rash. Itching is most intense at night. The rash can start anywhere on th e body (generally the face is spared) and continues to spread over the body until appropriately treated. Who gets scabies? Anyone can get scabies. Scabies affects all persons regardless of economic status, color of skin, age, or standard of personal hygiene. How is scabies spread? Scabies are most commonly passed from one infested person to another through direct skin to skin contact. Occasionally, scabies has been transferred from undergarments, bedclothes, bedding or other articles having skin contact with an infested person. What are the symptoms? Itching and scratching, especially at night. The rash can look like many other skin problems (eczema, dermatitis, poison ivy or oak, even chicken pox). Sometimes secondary bacterial infections occur as a result of the constant scratching that leads to bleeding and/or abraded skin that allows entry of disease producing organisms. How soon do symptoms appear? For persons getting scabies for the first time, itching and the rash can take up to eight (8) weeks to appear. Normal range is 2-6 weeks. For a person who gets reinfested with scabies, itchi ng and rash will occur within one to four days. How long can a person spread scabies? The scabies mite can be transferred once an infest ed person has skin-to-skin contact with another person. Therefore, persons who are yet to show symptoms can transfer the mite prior to their knowledge of having scabies. This is why outbreaks of scabies can occur within institutions like long term care facilities. How is scabies diagnosed? Because the rash caused by scabies can look like many other types of rashes, diagnosis is important and easily achieved by performing skin scrapings . A nurse may perform this procedure without a doctor's order, as it is a noninvasive procedure . See the Department of Health's \"Guidelines for Scabies Prevention and Control\" (Appendix J.) for how to perform skin scrapings. Once one resident or employee is found to have scabies, it is important to check all residents who may have had skin-to-skin contact with the infested individual, for sk in rashes, and to complete a questionnaire for all employees, again who may have had contact with the affected resident or employee, to learn of possible rashes. For employees, rash will generally be noted on the inner aspects of the arms or on the abdomen. (Due to the lifting and turning of residents) What is the treatment for scabies? Section 10.0. Infectious Disease Fact Sheets Subsection 10.9 Scabies INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES A medicated lotion or cream, known as a \"scabicide,\" which must be prescribed by a physician, is required to effectively treat a person with scabies. This lotion or cream must cover the entire surface of the skin (generally from the tips of the ear lobes to the ends of one's toes). A second, and sometimes a third, application may be necessary to adequately treat a person. Scabicides are pesticides and must be used with caution. Products containing topical five percent permethrin are considered safer than products containing lindane. When only one resident is found to have a rash caused by scabies, only this person and his/her roommate require treatment. The pe rson and/or persons s hould be isolated during the treatment period and gowns and gloves should be worn for applying th e scabicide and for any skin-to-skin or bedside contact. Environmental cleaning and laundering of bed linens, bed clothes, and clothes worn in the past three days also must occu r with clean clothes donned following the post-treatment shower/bath. Refer to the Department of Health's \"Guidelines for Scabies Prevention and Control\" (Appendix J.). When more than one resident and/or employee ar e found to have scabies, than all persons having skin-to-skin contact with either infested person requires treatment. This is called mass treatment and may involve one wing or hall or the entire fac ility depending on the location of the symptomatic individuals. Mass treatment protocols require pla nning. Refer to the Department of Health's \"Guidelines for Scabies Prevention and Control\" (Appendix J.). Do I need to treat furniture, other household items? Vacuuming of upholstered furniture and rugs is r ecommended. It is not necessary to clean walls or curtains. Laundering of bed linens and bedclothes is very im portant and must be done following treatment of the infested person and/or prior to reuse by anyone. For items that cannot be washed, either dry clean, place in a hot dryer for 20 minutes, or place in a plastic bag and seal for 10 days. Following treatment will itching cease? Itching may continue for two or more weeks following treatment. Scabicides are very drying to the skin plus the body must absorb eggs and fecal pellets left under the skin by the scabies mites. Application of skin lotions and bath oils aid in minimizing dry skin. What will be noted is improvement of the rash (drying up and going away) and absence of new rash. Recommendations for long term care facilities: Screen all new admissions for skin rashes. If present, isolate individual until rash has been diagnosed, and if communicable, adequately treated. When rashes appear, consider scabies. Do a sk in scraping to rule out or confirm scabies. Read and know the \"Guidelines for Scabies Prevention and Control\" provided by the ?, Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. Call you local public health agency or the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services for assistance. All outbreaks are reportable. Report to your local public health agency, district office or Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services.Section 10.0. Infectious Disease Fact Sheets Subsection 10.10 Shingles INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES INFECTIOUS DISEASE FACT SHEET Shingles (Herpes Zoster) What are shingles? Shingles is a viral disease that occurs as a result of having had chickenpox at an earlier age. Following infection with chickenpox, the viru s lies dormant in the body, generally along a nerve root, and is reactivated when host defense mechanisms wane either due to age or disease. What are the symptoms? Shingles are generally characterized by the appearance of grouped vesicular lesions that appear along one to three nerve paths, usually on one side of the body, with mild to severe pain. The two most common symptoms reported are severe pain and/or itching. How soon do symptoms occur? Highly variable, from months to years, after having chickenpox. Shingles is a reactivation of chickenpox. Can shingles be spread? No. In order to get shingles, one must have had chickenpox. However, direct contact with lesion secretions, and in rare cases, contact with airborne secretions1 can result in spread of the disease. Either of these situations by so meone who has never been vaccinated for or had chickenpox, can result in virus acquisition and subsequent chickenpox infection. Restriction of contact by caregivers who have not had chickenpox is appropriate in any setting. Can shingles be treated? Antiviral medications (Virarabine, acyclovir or famciclovir) are available and effective in treating herpes zoster. Often the duration of symptoms, including pain, are shortened with antiviral therapy. 1 Weller, Thomas H., \"Varicella-Herped Zoster Virus\".

Infectious Disease Fact Sheets Subsection 10.11 Tuberculosis INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES INFECTIOUS DISEASE FACT SHEET Tuberculosis What is tuberculosis? Tuberculosis is a disease caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis . This bacterium can cause disease anywhere in the body, but is of most concern for transmission when found in the lungs. Who gets tuberculosis? Anyone can get tuberculosis if they are exposed to someone who has it in their lungs and is coughing, sneezing or singing. Risk for transmission is greatest in small enclosed areas. Even though persons of any age can get tuberculosis, cer tain groups of people are considered to be at greater risk. These groups include: babies and very young children, persons who are HIV positive or persons with weak immune system s, especially if they have the following conditions: substance abuse, diabetes mellitus, silicosis, cancer of the head or neck, leukemia or Hodgkin's disease, severe kidney disease, low body weight or certain medical treatments (such as steroid therapy or organ transplants) . Other persons who may be at higher risk of developing tuberculosis due to potential exposur e include: persons who have spent time with a person who is infectious with tuberculos is, persons who are HIV positive, persons who inject drugs, persons from countries where tube rculosis is commonly seen (Latin America, Caribbean, Africa and Asia, except Japan) and persons who live somewhere in the United States where tuberculosis can be common (e.g.: homeless shelters, migrant farm camps). What are the symptoms of tuberculosis? The symptoms which may indicate a person has tuberculosis include: weight loss, fever, night sweats, a bad cough which lasts 2 weeks or longer, coughing up blood, or pain in the chest. If these symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated for tuberculosis. How soon do symptoms occur? The time between exposure and the developmen t of symptoms can be weeks to years. Typically, if one has an exposure and gets the tuberculosis germ in their body, their tuberculin skin test (PPD) will turn positive in 4-12 weeks. Only about 10% of persons who have a positive PPD will ever have symptoms of tuberculosis, and this could be years later. How is tuberculosis spread? Tuberculosis is spread via the air. Airborne droplet nuclei are expelled into the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes, sings and talks. Section 10.0. Infectious Disease Fact Sheets Subsection 10.11 Tuberculosis INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES How is tuberculosis diagnosed? The first step in diagnosis involves a tuberculin skin test using the intradermal PPD (Mantoux Test). A complete history with par ticular attention to signs and symptoms of tuberculosis is essential. A chest x-ray will help visualize the lungs to look for any active disease. Sputum may be sent to the laboratory for Acid Fast Bacillus (AFB) smear and culture. What is the treatment for tuberculosis? If a person is infectious with tuberculosis, they should be initially treated with four anti-tuberculosis drugs. These drugs include: Isoniazid (INH), Pyrazinamide, Etha nbutol, Ethambutol, and Streptomycin or alternates if allergies are present. Continued choice of therapy will be determined based upon resistance of the tuberculosis germ identified from the patient. What isolation measures are needed for tuberculosis? In the long term care setting, the patient with activ e tuberculosis will need to be placed in a negative pressure isolation room on AFB precautions until tuberculosis is either ruled out or the patient is no longer infectious. Since most long term care facilities do not have negative pressure rooms, the patient should be transferred to an acute care hospital for isolation. What follow-up is needed for someone ex posed to a person with tuberculosis? If someone is exposed to a person with active tuberculosis, they should be evaluated for tuberculosis via a tuberculin skin test (PPD) at the time of exposure and again 10-12 weeks later. If a person has previously tested positive for tuberculosis via the PPD skin-test, review for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis and obtain a chest x-ray. Contact your local public health agency for guidance in tuberculosis follow-up.Section 10.0. Infectious Disease Fact Sheets Subsection 10.12 Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci (VRE) INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES INFECTIOUS DISEASE FACT SHEETS Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci (VRE) What are enterococci? Enterococci are bacteria that are normally found in the bowel and vagina of humans. When these bacteria get outside of these areas, they may cause urinary tract infections, wound infections or bloodstream infections. Enterococci are now the third most common cause of infections in hospi- talized patients. These bacteria are often difficult to treat with antibiotics. However, one antibiotic that is normally effective is known as vancomycin. How dangerous are enterococci? They are fairly mild bacteria. Usually, they do not make healthy people sick. They can cause disease when people are very ill, like when the walls insi de the bowel are damaged or when persons have devices such as catheters placed inside their bladde rs. Although infections with these bacteria usually clear up on their own without treatment, vancomyc in-resistant enterococci cause special concern because the types of antibiotics available for treatment are limited. Many of these infections are often not treatable with the antibiotics that we have. What are vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE)? Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are ente rococci that can no longer be treated with vancomycin. This is primarily due to the high u se of antibiotics. VRE now join the list of other bacteria that are difficult to treat with antibiotics. Who gets ill with VRE? Enterococci normally live in the bowel and genital tract. Therefore, most people have these bacteria inside of them without being ill. Those most likely to become ill with VRE are people who: Are older Have long hospital stays, especially in an intensive care unit Were hospitalized in the past Have taken antibiotics in the past Had prior surgery Have had medical devices such as urinary catheters How is VRE passed from person to person? These bacteria go from person to person on unwashed ha nds or objects. They are not carried in the air. What can and should be done to limit the spread of VRE? The most important control measure is good ha ndwashing and personal cleaning habits. All care providers should routinely wash their hands before a nd after patient care and any time they are soiled. Section 10.0. Infectious Disease Fact Sheets Subsection 10.12 Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci (VRE) INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES Since these bacteria live in the bowel, they are found in human feces, but they may be carried in any human body fluid. Handwashing and wearing gloves should be a regular habit any time it is likely that hands will be soiled with these fluids. A gown or apron should be worn when it is likely that clothes will be soiled with another person's body fluids. Because these bacteria can be present in people without signs and symptoms of infection, it makes little sense to take \"extra\" precautions simply because the organism has been identified. In health care settings, the use of common sense precautions such as good handwashing and the proper u se of barriers such as gloves and aprons have been found to work as well as more restrictive isolation systems. What about cleaning and disinfection of the environment? Since bacteria such as VRE may be passed on me dical devices, methods for cleaning these devices should be in writing and should be followed. Th ese bacteria have been found on surfaces in care areas. Although no special cleaning agents are n ecessary to remove them, good cleaning of surfaces in all patient care areas is important. Cleaning methods should emphasize \"elbow grease\". Why do bacteria change so the antibiotics no longer work? Some bacteria can naturally resist the effects of an tibiotics. Other types of bacteria get used to living in the presence of antibiotics when an tibiotics are taken often, taken when not needed or taken in the wrong doses. Later, when antibiotics are needed, the drug no longer kills these bacteria. Proper use can increase the length of time an antibiotic is useful . It is important that the public and the health care community do all they can to assure that antibiotics are ordered and used in a correct manner. Here are a few tips to increase the time that antibiotics remain effective: Do not pressure your doctor to prescribe antibiotics. Do not give your antibiotics to other people. Do not take antibiotics that have been sitting around the house unless prescribed by your doctor for a current illness. Summary 1. An infection caused by bacteria that is diffi cult to treat with antibiotics (such as VRE) is no different than an infection caused by other bact eria, except that treatment options are limited. 2. The same infection control measures used to prevent the spread of all bacteria that can cause disease should be used to prevent th e spread of bacteria like VRE. 3. The best way to prevent disease transmissi on is for clients and caregivers to follow good handwashing techniques and to use barriers such as gloves when soiling of the hands is likely. Other barriers such as gowns or aprons should be worn when soiling of clothing is likely. 4. Consistent and proper cleaning of surfaces like tabletops and medical devices is also important in removing these bacteria. For more information about VRE or use of antibiotics, ask your physician or health care provider, infection control professional, pharmacist or contact Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services.Section 11.0 Infection Control Resources Subsection: Table of Contents INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES INFECTION CONTROL RESOURCES TABLE OF CONTENTS 11.0 Infection Control Resources 11.1 Infection Control ResourcesSection 11.0 Infection Control Resources Subsection 11.1 Infection Control Resources INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES INFECTION CONTROL RESOURCES Infection Control Resources Beneson Abram S.

Glossary of Infection Control Terms and Definitions INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES GLOSSARY OF INFECTION CONTROL TERMS AND DEFINITIONS The following definitions apply to these terms as used in this document. Baseline infection rate - The average rate of new infections per body site in the past one to five years. Body Substance Precautions (BSP) - a practical, safe approach whereby barriers (gloves, gowns, eyewear and masks) are used to prev ent contact with all moist body substances (blood, feces, urine, wound drainage, tissues, or al secretions, and other body fluids) as well as non-intact skin. Carrier - An individual who harbors the specific or ganisms of a disease without manifesting symptoms and is capable of transmitting the inf ection. The condition of such an individual is referred to as the carrier state. Change in character of urine - Any significant change in the gross (e.g., new bloody urine, foul smell, or amount of sediment) or micros copic (new pyuria, or microscopic hematuria) character of the urine. For microscopic changes, this means that the results of a previous urinalysis must be on the chart. There is no time limit on when the previous urinalysis may have been done. Change in functional status - A change in the resident's ability or willingness to carry out activities of daily living. For instance, new incontinence, new inability to walk to the dining room, or increased difficulty in transferring from bed to wheelchair would all be recorded as change in functional status. Change in mental status - A change in the resident's cognitive function, such as a change in the ability to make decisions; in orientation to person, place, or time; or level of alertness, mood, and/or behavior. Cohort - The placement of two or more resident s with similar symptoms or diagnosed conditions in the same room or area of a fac ility, physically separated from other residents, and cared for by staff who do not care for other residents. Colonization - The condition of a resident where a microorganism is on the skin or has entered a body site, is multiplying but no clinical signs and symptoms or injury to the body are evident. A colonized resident represents a reservoir (conditions providing survival and growth) of an organism in the facility. Compatible clinical syndrome - An acute illness with symptoms related to a relevant body system (respiratory or gastrointestinal). In general, the symptoms will be some of those included in the definitions for either lower resp iratory tract infection or gastroenteritis, but the criteria for the infection need not be met. Conjunctiva - The delicate membrane that lines the ey elids and covers the exposed surface of the eyeball. Appendices Appendix B. Glossary of Infection Control Terms and Definitions INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES Diagnosis by a physician - Requires one of the following: Written note by a physician specifying diagnosis, or Nursing note specifying that a diagnosis was made by a physician, or Verbal report from either a physician or nurse that a specific diagnosis has been made. Ear infection - Includes infections of the external ear (otitis externa), middle ear (otitis media), or internal ear labyrinthitis, vestibular neuronitis). Endemic - When the number or rate of colonizations and/or infections are relatively constant for a specific time and place in a facility. Epidemiologically associated - An ill person who has had cont act with an infected case, particularly a laboratory-confirmed case, wherei n the transmission of the infectious agent is plausible to have occurred from the known infected case. Fever - A single temperature, taken by any route; of >38o C or 100.4 o F. and/or When body temperature is 2.4 o F above the resident's normal baseline. (Example: Median oral temperature of elderly persons is 96.8 o F. Normal body temperature in the aged may be as low as 95.0 o F. A temperature of 98.0 o F should be considered fever in a resident who usually carries a temperature of 95.0 o F.) Flank - Side of the body, below the rib cage and above the hip. (The area in which pain is usually felt in upper urinary tract infections is re ferred to as the \"costovertebral angle.\" It is a relatively posterior area of the flank just below the ribs and extending from the side nearly to the backbone). Hypothermia - A body temperature which is below 34.5 o C or 94.1 o F, or which does not register on a thermometer being used. Incidence rate of infections - Number of residents with newly acquired infection divided by the total number of residents at risk for infection multiplied by 100 resident days or preferably 1000 resident care days during a defined period of time. Infection - The condition of a resident where a microorganism has entered a body site, multiplies, and causes clinical signs and sympto ms such as fever, purulent wound drainage, and/or tissue destruction, expectoration of pur ulent sputum, frequent urination with burning. Invasive site - Any place on a resident's body where the normal skin or mucous membrane barrier is broken, either by natural or artificia l means. Decubitus ulcers, surgical incision sites, intravenous or urinary catheters, and feeding gastrostomy or jejunostomy tubes are common examples. Investigating the outbreak - A process of systematically gathering information on residents and staff of a facility regarding demogra phics, illness and exposure factors, and the Appendices Appendix B. Glossary of Infection Control Terms and Definitions INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES tabulation of that information in order to establish associations between illness and any predisposing risk factors for that illness. Laboratory confirmation - A laboratory test of a clinical specimen that identifies the presence of one or more disease-producing microorganisms. Low level disinfectant or disinfection - A product or process that destroys most bacteria, some viruses, some fungi, but not Mycobacterium tuberculosis or bacterial spores. This EPA registered hospital disinfectant has no label claim for tuberculocidal activity. This agent is an excellent cleaner and can be used for routine housekeeping or removal of soil in the absence of visible blood contamination. Lymphadenopathy - Enlargement of lymph glands. Maculopapular - A rash characterized by abnormally colo red (usually red) areas of skin, of varying size, which is partially flat and partially somewhat raised. Malaise - A feeling of generalized body discomfort. Mantoux test - Intracutaneous tuberculin skin test. The current standard method of tuberculosis testing in which tuberculin is administered intradermally using a needle and syringe. Multiply resistant organisms - Usually considered bacteria, but can be a virus or fungus which is resistant to two or more unrelated an timicrobials to which the organism is normally considered susceptible or is resistant to more than one of the first line or key drugs, and occasionally carbapenems. New physical findings on chest exam - New findings on examination of the chest with a stethoscope which suggest pneumonia (i.e., rales [crackles], rhonchi [wheezes], or bronchial breathing). Nosocomial infection - An infection that was not presen t or incubating within the first 72 hours of admission to the facility. A nosocomial infection is considered \"facility acquired\" or \"facility associated.\" Organism thought to be a contaminant (in blood culture) - Organisms which are common skin flora that can contaminate blood cultures as a result of improper aseptic technique. A single positive blood culture for one of these may be non-significant. Other potentially infectious materials (OPIM) - 1. The following human body fluids: semen, va ginal secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, pleural fluid, pericardial fluid, peritoneal fluid, amniotic fluid, saliva in dental procedures, any body fluid that is visibly contaminated with blood, and all body fluids in situations where it is difficult or im possible to differentiate between body fluids. 2. Any unfixed tissue or organ (other than intact skin) from a human (living or dead); and Appendices Appendix B. Glossary of Infection Control Terms and Definitions INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES 3. HIV-containing cell or tissue cultures, or gan cultures, and HIV- or HBV-containing culture medium or other solutions; and blood, or gans, or other tissues from experimental animals infected with HIV or HBV. Outbreak - An occurrence of similar illnesses that are in excess (generally 2 to 2 1/2 times) of the normal expectancy for a given location, a nd period of time. It can also be one case of an unusually virulent disease, two cases when persons do not share a room, OR two cases where one case is in the resident population and one case is in the employee population. Pathogen - A microorganism capable of causing disease. Pleuritic chest pain - Pain caused by inflammation of th e pleura (lung lining): a sharp pain felt at any site over the rib-cage, which is brought on or made much worse by deep breathing. Purulent - Containing the by-products of inflammation (pus). Serous - With watery consistency (as opposed to purulent). Suprapubic - Above the pubic arch (i.e., the area of the bladder, in the central lower area of the abdomen). Tine test - Four tines or prongs 2 mm. long, attached to a plastic handle and coated with dip- dried old tuberculin (O.T.) which are pressed in to the skin located on the inner surface of the forearm, where they deposit a dose of the tuberculin in the outer layer. The tine test is no longer recommended for tuberculosis screening or testing. The Mantoux test is the appropriate tuberculosis screening test. Transmission - The spread of a microorganism from a colonized or infected person to a person previously free of the organism. Universal Precautions (UP) - An approach to infection control. According to the concept of Universal Precautions, all human blood and cer tain human body fluids (see definition of \"other potentially infectious materials\") are tr eated as if known to be infectious for HIV, HBV, and other bloodborne pathogens. Used as CDC intended, UP is implemented in conjunction with category specific isolation (cont act, respiratory, enteric, AFB) or disease specific isolation for infections other than bloodborne. Vesicular - Applied to a rash characterized by blister-like lesions (i.e., localized areas to elevated skin, usually only a few millimeters in size, containing a watery substance).Appendices Appendix C.

Department of Health Tuberculosis Testing Rule INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH TUBERCULOSIS TESTING RULE 19 CSR 20-20.100 Tuberculosis Testing for Residents and Workers in Long-Term Care Facilities and State Correctional Centers PURPOSE: This rule establishes tuberculosis testing requirements for residents and workers in long-term care facilities and state correctional centers. (1) General Requirements. Long-term care facilities and state correctional centers shall screen their residents and staff for tuberculosis using the Mantoux method purified protein derivative (PPD) five tuberculin unit (5 TU) test. Each facility shall be responsible for ensuring that all test results are completed and that documentation is maintained for all residents, employees, and volunteers. (A) In interpreting this rule, long-term care facilities shall include employees, volunteers, and residents of residential care facilities I, residential care facilities II, intermediate care facilities and skilled nursing facilities as defined in section 198.006, RSMo. (B) In interpreting this rule, state correctional centers shall include all employees and volunteers of the Missouri Department of Corrections and the residents of all correctional institutions operated by the Missouri Department of Corrections. (C) Whenever tuberculosis is suspected or confirmed, or tuberculosis infection is diagnosed among residents, employees or volunteers, the Department of Health or local health authority shall be notified as required in 19 CSR 20-20.020(2). (2) Long-Term Care Residents. Within one (1) month prior to or one (1) week after admission, all residents new to long-term care are required to have the initial test of a Mantoux PPD two (2)-step tuberculin test. If the initial test is negative, zero to nine millimeters (0 9 mm), the second test, which can be given after admission, should be given one to three (1) (3) weeks later. Documentation of chest X-ray evidence ruling out tuberculosis disease within one (1) month prior to admission, along with an evaluation to rule out signs and symptoms compatible with infectious tubercu-losis, may be accepted by the facility on an interim basis until the Mantoux PPD two (2)-step test is completed. (A) All skin test results are to be documented in millimeters (mm) of induration. (B) Bacillus of Calmette and Guerin (BCG) vaccination shall not prevent residents from receiving a tuberculin test.

Department of Natural Resources Rules INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES RULES (only those sections pertaining to infectious waste in long term care facilities have been reprinted here) 10 CSR 80-7.010 Infectious Waste/Manage- ment PURPOSE: This rule pertains to the management and treatment of infectious waste. PUBLISHER'S NOTE: The publication of the full text of the material that the adopting agency has incorporated by reference in this rule would be unduly cumbersome or expensive. Therefore, the full text of that material will be made available to any interested person at both the Office of the Secretary of State and the office of the adopting agency, pursuant to section 536.031.4, RSMo. Such material will be provided at the cost established by state law. (1) Applicability. (A) Definition. Infectious waste means waste capable of producing an infectious disease because it contains pathogens of sufficient virulence and quantity so that exposure to the waste by a susceptible human host could result in an infectious disease. These wastes include isolation wastes, cultures and stocks of etiologi c agents, blood and blood products, pathological wastes, other contaminated wastes from surgery and autopsy, contaminated laboratory wastes, sharps, dialysis unit wastes, discarded biological materials known or suspected to be infectious; provided, however, that infectious waste does not mean waste treated to department specifica-tions. 1. For the purposes of this chapter, a generator means any single office (doctor's office, dentist's office, and the like) or facility (hospital, nursing home, mortuary, and the like), whose act or process first causes an infectious waste. For purposes of tracking and fees, a transfer station permitted as an infectious waste processing facility becomes the generator when the infectious waste is transported for further processing. 2. Small quantity generators, i.e., per- sons generating one hundred kilograms (100 kg) or less per month of infectious waste, shall refer to 19 CSR 20-20.010 for the Department of Health definition of those categories of waste to be managed as an infectious waste. (B) Disposal of Infectious Waste. All sharps shall be packaged in rigid, leak- resistant and puncture-resistant containers and sealed prior to disposal. 1. Infectious waste treated to render it innocuous may be disposed as a solid waste provided the treater certifies to the transporter, if other than the generator, and certifies to the sanitary landfill operator that the waste has been rendered innocuous as required by section 260.203, RSMo. (Note: Treated infectious waste is not required to be transported in accordance with the requirements of section (4) of this rule.) 2. Certification of treated infectious waste, at a minimum, shall contain the following information: the name, mailing address, location (when different from the mailing address) and phone number of the office/facility treating the infectious waste; the printed name and the signature of the facility/office manager or person responsible for the treatment process; a brief description of the treated waste (sharps in metal containers, sharps in heavy guage plastic containers, incinerator ash, laboratory wastes in autoclave bags); and a brief description of the method(s) of treatment (for example, steam sterilization, incineration, disinfection with bleach solution). In addition to these minimum requirements, the generator need only include a statement that the waste has been managed in accordance with the Missouri Solid Waste Management Law and rules and may legally be placed in a sanitary landfill. The certification shall be revised when changes in the operation of the office/facility result in a change to the information required by this paragraph.Appendices Appendix F. Department of Natural Resources Rules INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES (C) Exemptions 3. A person generating one hundred (100) kg or less per month of infectious waste as defined in 19 CSR 20-20.010 and who transports his/her own infectious waste for processing is exempt from the transportation and fee requirements of this rule, except that the vehicle used for transport of the infectious waste shall be a closed and secured vehicle. (2) Packaging of Infectious Waste. Prior to transport, all infectious waste shall be placed in rigid or semi-rigid, leak-resistant containers clearly marked with the universal biohazard symbol prominently displayed and labeled Infectious Waste or Biohazard Waste and sealed. All containers shall be closed in such a manner as to completely contain all waste and the outside of the container shall be kept free of contamination. For the purpose of this rule, leak-resistant containers are defined as containers that are closable with a tight fitting lid and are leakproof on the bottom and sides. Containers meeting the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.1030 are acceptable. (A) Plastic bags. Plastic bags shall be tear resistant and leak resistant. Plastic bags shall not be used as primary containers for transportation of infectious waste. Infectious waste contained in plastic bags shall be placed within rigid or semi-rigid containers prior to transport. (B) Sharps containers. Sharps shall be packaged in rigid, leak-resistant and puncture- resistant containers and sealed. (C) Glass Containers. Glass containers shall not be used as primary containers for transportation of infectious waste. Glass containers must be placed into a rigid or semi-rigid leak-resistant container and protected from breakage. (D) Reusable containers. Reusable containers shall be cons tructed of either heavy wall plastic or noncorrosive metal. Each container shall be cleaned and sanitized before it is reused.

(1) The definitions in 19 CSR 20-26.050 shall be used in the interpretation of this rule. (2) Any health care professional who performs invasive procedures is advised to know his/her human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody status and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) status. If HBsAg is present, the presence or absence of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) shall be determined. If a significant occupational exposure occurs which could place the health care professional at risk of acquiring HIV or hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, appropriate post-exposure evaluation should be undertaken. (3) HIV- or HBV-infected health care profes-sionals who perform invasive procedures may be voluntarily evaluated by an expert review panel appointed by the department according to section 191.700, RSMo. This panel shall follow subsections (3)(A)-(P) of this rule. (A) Health care professionals infected with HIV or HBV who perform invasive procedures and who choose to be evaluated by an expert review panel appointed by the department according to section 191.700, RSMo shall apply for the evaluation in writing to the director. Directors of health care facilities (chief administrative officers or equivalents) allowed by 191.700.2(1), RSMo to seek evaluation of infected health care professionals who perform invasive procedures shall, with the consent of the infected health care professional and after consultation with the professional's private physician, apply in writing to the director of the Department of Health. (B) Upon receipt of a written request for evaluation, the director shall appoint an expert review panel by utilizing the following criteria: 1. The panel shall include those individuals specified by 191.700.2(2)(a)-(d), RSMo and may include additional individuals if the director determines this is necessary; and 2.

(F) The health care professional shall be allowed to appear before the panel and present any information which s/he believes to be pertinent to the panels task. The health care professionals personal physician(s) and any other individual(s) the health care professional believes can provide pertinent input into the process shall be allowed to appear before the panel. Appendices Appendix H. Department of Health Care Provider Rules INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES (G) The panel may recommend that restrictions or limitations be placed on the practice of the health care professional. (H) The panel shall require the health care professional to notify any affected patient in a timely manner whenever a parenteral or mucous membrane exposure to the health care professional's blood occurs. (I) The panel's findings and recommenda-tions shall be conveyed in writing to the health care professional and to the director. (J) The director shall disclose to the chief administrative officer or equivalent individual in each health care facility or community- based practice where the health care professional is performing invasive procedures any restrictions or limitations placed on his/her practice by the panel. (K) If the health care professional seeks to affiliate with an additional health care facility or community-based practice, regardless of its location, where s/he will be performing invasive procedures, s/he shall disclose to the chief administrative officer or equivalent individual in that facility or practice the findings of the review panel, and any restrictions or limitations placed on his/her practice by the panel, prior to the affiliation and the provision of patient care. S/he shall also advise the department of the new practice location. (L) If the health care professional plans to begin performing invasive procedures at a health care facility or community-based practice where s/he is currently affiliated but not presently performing those procedures, s/he shall disclose to the chief administrative officer or equivalent individual in that facility or practice the findings of the review panel, and any restrictions or limitations placed on his/her practice by the panel, prior to the performance of any invasive procedures, and report his/her intention to begin performing invasive procedures in writing to the director prior to beginning to perform these procedures. (M) If the review panel places restrictions or limitations on the health care professional's practice, it shall be the responsibility of each health care facility where s/he is employed and performing invasive procedures to monitor him/her for compliance at appropriate intervals, at least annually, based on his/her medical status and the types and frequencies of invasive procedures s/he performs. If a facility finds the health care professional to be noncompliant, it shall report this in writing to the appropriate state board, as provided under Chapters 330, 332, 334 or 335, RSMo, and to the director. (N) If the review panel places restrictions or limitations on the practice of a health care professional who performs invasive procedures in a community-based setting, it shall be the responsibility of the department to monitor him/her for compliance in this setting at appropriate intervals, at least annually, based on his/her medical status and the types and frequencies of invasive procedures s/he performs. If the department finds the health care professional to be noncompliant, it shall report this in writing to the appropriate state board, as provided under Chapters 330, 332, 334 or 335, RSMo, and to the director. (O) If the director becomes aware that the infected health care professional is noncompliant with practice restrictions or limitations at any location where s/he is performing invasive procedures, the director shall report this noncompliance to the chief administrative officer or equivalent individual in each health care facility and community-based practice where the health care professional performs invasive procedures. (P) The panel shall require, as necessary, that the infected health care professional undergo periodic reviews to determine if the decision to place or not to place restrictions or limitations on his/her practice needs to be modified because of changes in his/her medical condition or some other relevant circumstance. If a review results in the panel making such a modification, this modification shall be conveyed in writing to the health care professional and the director. If the modification results in restrictions or limita- tions, or further restrictions or limitations, being placed on the health care professional, the director shall disclose this modification to the chief administrative officer or equivalent individual in each health care facility or community-based practice where the health care professional is performing invasive procedures. (Q) If restrictions or limitations have been placed on a health care professional's practice Appendices Appendix H. Department of Health Care Provider Rules INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES by the panel and if later there is a change in the individual's medical condition or some other relevant circumstance, and as a result s/he believes that the restrictions or limitations should be modified, s/he may request in writing to the director that the panel consider such a modification. A similar written request may also be made by the director or chief administrative officer of a health care facility with the consent of th e infected health care professional and after consultation with his/her private physician. The panel shall review the information and determine whether modification is necessary. If a modification is made, this shall be conveyed in writing to the health care professional and the director. If the modification results in further restrictions or limitations being placed on the health care professional, the director shall disclose this modification to the chief administrative officer or equivalent individual in each health care facility or community-based practice where the health care professional is performing invasive procedures. (4) As described in 191.700.2(5)(d), RSMo, a health care facility peer review panel may evaluate HIV- or HBV-infected health care professionals who perform invasive procedures. This evaluation process may be accessed directly by an infected health care professional, or by the director of a health care facility with the consent of the infected health care professional and after consultation with his/her private physician. This evaluation shall take place as follows: (A) If a health care facility regulated under sections 197.010-197.120, RSMo maintains or establishes an internal peer review panel for the evaluation of HIV- or HBV-infected health care professionals who perform invasive procedures, this panel shall- 1. Maintain the confidentiality of the infected health care professional. Panel members shall be subject to the requirements of section 191.656, RSMo regarding the confidentiality of information on an HIV- infected health care professional's infection status; 2. Conduct an evaluation of the infected health care professional and his/her practice. This evaluation and any recommendations shall be based on the premise that HIV or HBV infection alone does not justify limiting the health care professional's duties; 3. Allow the health care professional to appear before the peer review panel and present any information which s/he believes to be pertinent to the panels task. The health care professional's personal physician(s), as well as any other individual(s) the health care profes- sional believes can provide input into the process, shall be allowed to appear before the panel; 4. Establish, utilizing the criteria speci-fied in subsection (3)(D) of this rule, whether restrictions or limitations shall be placed on the practice of the health care professional. If the panel is uncertain about whether a specific procedure may pose some risk of HIV or HBV transmission, it may recommend that this pro-cedure be performed only after the patient has been informed of the health care professional's infection status; 5. Require the health care professional to notify any affected patient in a timely manner whenever a parenteral or mucous membrane exposure to the health care professional's blood occurs; 6. Report its findings and recommendations in writing to the health care professional; 7. Report its findings and recommendations in writing to the director including how the evaluation process was conducted. The department shall review the report to determine concurrence with 191.700.2(5)(d), RSMo and this rule. Results of the department's review shall be reported back to the facility. In the event the health care professional later seeks an evaluation by a department-appointed panel, the findings and recommendations of the facility's peer review panel shall be included as part of this evaluation; and 8. Require, as necessary, that the infected health care professional undergo periodic reviews to determine if the decision to place or not to place restrictions or limitations on his/her practice needs to be modified because of changes in his/her medical condition or some other relevant circumstance. If a review results in the panel making such a modification, this modification Appendices Appendix H. Department of Health Care Provider Rules INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES shall be conveyed in writing to the health care professional and the director; and (B) When a facility's internal peer review panel conducts a review in concurrence with 191.700.2(5)(d), RSMo and this rule, the following shall be performed: 1. The infected health care professional shall provide a list to the director of all other health care facilities and community-based practices, regardless of location, where s/he performs invasive procedures. The director shall disclose to the chief administrative officer or equivalent individual in each of these other facilities and practices any restrictions or limitations placed on the health care professional's practice by the panel; 2. If the health care professional seeks to affiliate with an additional health care facility or community-based practice, regardless of its location, where s/he will be performing invasive procedures, s/he shall disclose to the chief administrative officer or equivalent individual in that facility or practice the findings of the peer review panel, and any restrictions or limitations placed on his/her practice by the panel, prior to the affiliation and the provision of patient care, and notify the department of the new practice location; 3. If the health care professional plans to begin performing invasive procedures at a health care facility or community-based practice where s/he is currently affiliated but not presently performing those procedures, s/he shall disclose to the director or chief administrative officer in that facility or practice the findings of the peer review panel, and any restrictions or limitations placed on his/her practice by the panel, prior to the performance of any invasive procedures, and report the change in practice to the department; 4. It shall be the responsibility of each health care facility where the health care pro- fessional is employed and performing invasive procedures to monitor him/her for compliance with the practice restrictions or limitations at appropriate intervals, at least annually, based on his/her medical status and the types and frequencies of invasive procedures s/he performs. If a facility finds the health care professional to be noncompliant, it shall report this in writing to the appropriate state board, as provided under Chapters 330, 332, 334 or 335, RSMo, and to the director; 5. If the health care professional also performs invasive procedures in a community- based setting, it shall be the responsibility of the department to monitor him/her for compliance with the restrictions or limitations in this setting at appropriate intervals, at least annually, based on his/her medical status and the types and frequencies of invasive procedures s/he performs. If the department finds the health care professional to be noncompliant, it shall report this in writing to the appropriate state board, as provided under Chapters 330, 332, 334 or 335, RSMo, and to the director; 6. If the director becomes aware that the infected health care professional is noncompliant with practice restrictions or limitations at any location where s/he is performing invasive procedures, the director shall report this noncompliance to the director or chief administrator in each health care facility and community-based practice where the health care professional performs invasive procedures; 7. If the peer review panel, as a result of a periodic review of the infected health care professional's status, makes a modification in its recommendations that results in restrictions or limitations, or further restrictions or limita- tions, being placed on the health care professional, the director shall disclose this modification to the chief administrative officer or equivalent individual in any other health care facilities or community-based practices where the health care professional is performing invasive procedures; and 8. If restrictions or limitations have been placed on a health care professional's practice by the peer review panel and if later there is a change in the health care professional's medical condition or some other relevant circumstance, and as a result s/he believes that the restrictions or limitations should be modified, s/he may request that the panel consider the modification. The panel shall review the pertinent evidence and determine whether such modification shall be made. If a modification is made, this shall be conveyed in writing to the health care pro- fessional and the director. If the modification Appendices Appendix H. Department of Health Care Provider Rules INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES results in further restrictions or limitations being placed on the health care professional, the director shall disclose the modification to the chief administrative officer or equivalent individual in any other health care facilities or community-based practices where the health care professional is performing invasive procedures.

The m ajority of these reports have com e from long term care facilitie s (LTCF's), although there are occasional reports from hospitals, day care centers and schools. Requests for assistance in resolving outbreaks in som e LTCF' s have uncovered probable scabies infestations lasting a year or longer. W e have had reports of sym ptoms developing ten days following exposure; however, m ost cases have an incubation period of four to six weeks for a prim ary infestation. A long incubation period (during which tim e the mite {sarcoptes scabiei var. hom inis} is able to be transm itted to close contacts) and a wide variety of presentations are problem atic in getting an accurate diagnosis. Because scabies can nodules and excoriation' s, it is necessary to do a careful history followed by burrow identification and skin scrapings for the m ite, its eggs or fecal pellets. The following are recom mendations for prevention and control of institutional scabies. A. Scabies Prevention Programs in Health Care Facilities Require That :1 1. Health care workers be suspicious of scab ies in person with a rash or pruritus that has gradually gotten worse, particularly during the night tim e hours; 2. Health care facilities establish a policy of exam ining newly admitted person for scabies and questioning new em ployees for either exposure to or symptoms of scabies; 3. The diagnostic skills of a consultant experienced in recognizing scabies be used in evaluating difficult or unusual cases; 4. In-house com petence in preparing and exam ining skin scrapings from suspect person be developed; 5. Protective clothing and gloves be used when providing hands-on care to persons suspected of having scabies; 7. A system for recording edpidem iologic and clinical inform ation on suspect and confirm ed person be established. B. Equipment Needed for Skin Scraping: INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES 1. Gloves 2. Magnify ing glass 3. Gooseneck lam p 4. Felt tip pen\u2014green or blue washable ink 5. Alcohol swabs 6. #15 scalpel blades, glass slides for scraping or curettes 7. Scalpel holder (optional) 8. Kelly clam p or other forceps (optional) 9. Slides and cover slips 10. Mineral oil or m icroscope im mersion oil 11. Requisitions, if slides are being sent to a public health laboratory 12. Sharps container 13. Clear nail polish or petrol eum jelly (to help seal the slide cover to slide) C. Procedure for Doing Skin Scrapings:1,2 1. Establish and confirm the diagnosis by skin scrapings and m icroscopic identification of mites, eggs or scybala (fecal pellets). A nurse from the facility can be taught this procedure by a derm atologist, the consulting physician or a by a nurse or technician who has had professional training in doing the procedure. a. Mass treatm ent (treating all person residing or working on a unit or in an entire facility ) should not be initiated unless a definite diagnosis has been made in at least 1 of the sy mptomatic cases.1 b. Scrape those persons with the m ost severe rash first. Elderly may present with severe urticaria and bullous lesions. c. Shoulders, back and abdom en are choice areas for scrapings in the elderly .2 Other sites: hands, wrists, elbows, feet, ankles, buttocks, axillae, knees, thighs, and breasts. d. Use hand-m agnify ing lens to identify recent burrows or papules. Look for non-excoriated, non-inflam ed areas. A bright light and a m agnify ing glass m ay assist in visualizing the m ite at the end of the burrow. e. Identify theses high y ield lesions by apply ing m ineral oil (best used over dry scaly areas) or by apply ing the burrow ink test to possible burrows. The burrow ink test is done by using a wide felt tip pen (blue or green are best) over burrows and then wiping off with an alcohol swab. The alcohol will rem ove m ost surface ink, but will not remove the ink taken up by the burrow, thus leaving a dark irregular line. f. Apply mineral oil or preferably microscope im mersion oil to lesions or scalpel blade and glass slides. g. Vigorously scrape uninfected burrows and papules with a #15 scalpel blade or glass slide held at a 90\u00b0 angle to the skin and while holding the skin taut until the statum corneum is rem oved. 2,3,4Scrapings m ay also be done without a holder for the #15 scalpel blade. The blade is held y the fingers at an angle that is m ore like 45\u00b0 to the skin. (Vigorous scraping appropriately results in a few red blood cells visible under the microscope, but there should not be frank bleeding.) Som e practitioners prefer using a small curette. Change blades or curettes between scrapings on different persons. Blades can be placed and rem oved from the handle with a forceps. Used blades m ust be placed in a sharps container. h. Transfer skin scrapings from 6 different sites to a single slide or to 6 different slides per patient.2 These scrapings can be pushed onto the slide edge and them moved to the center of the slide. i. Place a cover slip over the slide.2 j. Exam ine entire slide m ethodically under low power at 25-50-x magnification for at least 5 m inutes.1 Low power (2.5-4 x) is useful initially . The microscope should be taken to the facility ; however, if the practitioner is not trained in reading the slides, the cover slip should be secured to the slide at all edges with clear nail polish or petroleum jelly and transported personally , by courier, or by mail (in a secure m ailer) to: 1) Missouri State Public Health Laboratory (MSPHL); 2) A branch of MSPHL 3) A hospital or rural clinic laboratory with pre- arrangem ents; or 4) A physician' s office with pre-arrangem ents. Public health laboratory requisitions m ust accom pany slides if readings are to be done at public health laboratory . D. Surveillance and Collation of Edpidemiologic Variables for Scabies:1,2 1. Surveillance by chart review, intervie w and direct observation should be done, using a form such as in Appendi x A to identify all patients/residents who are likely to have been exposed to scabies. 2. Surveillance should be done by interview, com pletion of a self-adm inistered questionnaire such as in Appendix B and /or direct observation in order to identify all employees, including laundry personnel, who are likely to have been exposed to scabies. 3. Make a line list (see Appendix C for sam ple line list form ) of room number, age, sex, sy mptoms, date of onset for: a. Symptomatic persons with positive scrapings; differentiate between conventional and Norwegian (keratotic or crusted) scabies.1,2,5 (See Appendix D for \"Definitions of person with negative Asym ptom atic contacts of a sy mptomatic case. These contacts should be on a totally separate line list. Close contacts are person who have skin to skin contact, sleep in the sam e bed or handle infested clothes and bed linens. Contact of crusted scabies should be designated High Risk, Low Risk and No Risk per definitions on page 10. d. Contract tracing should go back 2 m onths. 4. Ascertain the epidem ic level: proportion of affected person (positive scrapings or symptomatic).1 This inform ation will determ ine whether person in the whole facility or just one section are treated. a. Determ ine percentage of affected person (patients or residents) within the entire facility 's population of patients or residents. b. Determ ine percentage of affected employees within the entire facility 's employee population. c. Determ ine percentage of affected person within each subgroup of a population; i.e., nursing hom e wing, hospital departm ent. 5. Look for sim ilarities or groupings in age and sex am ong affected persons.1 6. Ascertain ty pe and frequency of secondary bacterial infections.1,5 7. Determ ine the mode of transm ission; i.e., em ployees having close personal contact like bathing, bedm aking, apply ing skin lotions, frequent lifting/repositioning of patients1,2 Or exchanging clothing, sleeping on sam e linens, play ing gam es involving close hand or skin contact1,2 Or sexual contact. 1,2 E. General Recommendations 1. Report outbreak to the local health departm ent using an outbreak report form , Appendix E. Do not use separate CD - 1 cards for every case in an outbreak. 2. Notify facilities to which potentially infested patients or em ployees have transferred.1,8 3. Intensive educational program s should be given to all em ployees.1 They should be given a Fact Sheet on Scabies. 4. Scrapings need not be done on every symptomatic person in a large outbreak, but an effort should be m ade to scrape all persons having num erous lesions and symptoms of long duration. 5. Allocate sufficient personnel and f unding to initiate and m anage follow-up treatm ents. Facility should purchase enough sy mptomatic persons (patients/residents, em ployees, volunteers and fam ily members) and their close contacts.1,2 F. Selective Treatment Protocol1 1. A conventional scabies treatm ent regim en can be selective when only 1 person has a positive scraping and 1 -2 others on the sam e unit are sy mptomatic but have either not been scraped or have negative scrapings. Selective treatm ent protocol can be used.1 If a scraping is positive for a person who is severely immunocom prom ised or for a person who has crusted scabies, then the potential for spread is greatly increased and selective treatm ent protocol will probably not prevent further cases. (See G-3 and Appendix D, \"Definitions of Scabies Infestations\"). 2. The diagnosed and probable infested cases and sy mptomatic contacts should receive treatm ent with subsequent m onitoring for effectiveness of treatm ent. A skin scraping should be done on the sy mptomatic cases 1 m onth after treatm ent,2 particularly if rash and sy mptoms persist. (See section H) 3. All \"hands-on\" contacts during preced ing 2 m onths (em ployees, relatives and other patients) of any patient/resident with a positive scraping should be treated. Patients or residents having received \"h ands on\" personal care from a positively diagnosed or sy mptomatic em ployee should receive treatm ent, as should the employee's household.1,2,9 G. Mass Treatment Protocol1,2,9 1. Definition: A m ass treatm ent protocol uses the sam e drug regim ens as in selective treatm ent except that all persons residing or working on a unit or in an entire facility are treated. 2. One phy sician should be designated as the outbreak control officer and be given authority to m anage the treatm ent regim en of all residents in a long term care facility . At the least, all attending phy sicians should agree to a cooperative schedule for conventional or Norwegian scabies.9 3. Mass treatm ent should be adm inistered within a 24-48 hour period to all persons (residing and working) in a defined area of the facility if:2,9 Two (2) or m ore sy mptomatic patients/residents or em ployees have positive scrapings Or One (1) asy mptomatic patient/resident has a positive scraping and m any patients/residents have exhibited sy mptoms of infestation for m onths 10% rate of sy mptomatic infestation). Or Norwegian scabies is diagnosed in one (1) patient/resident and at least one (1) em ployee is sy mptomatic.1 4. Mass treatm ent of every one in the facility (all residents and at risk em ployees) should be adm inistered within a few successive day s if positive scrapings are found in 2 or m ore separate areas of the facility . 5. Employee cross-over should not be allowed until the specified population has been treated. 6. Household m embers, sexual contacts and room mates of sy mptomatic em ployees should be treated the sam e day as the em ployees. 1 7. Write a detailed schedule of: a. Who will be treated and who will do the treating; b. What will be used for treatm ent, including specific instructions on how to apply lotions; c. Where treatm ents will be done; i.e., a treatm ent room , individual beds, at home; d. When treatm ents will be done (date and tim e); e. State when the person will be considered non-infested, can be rem oved from isolation and can return to work. (See Section I) 8. Write a second schedule for: a. Reassessm ent of all treated person at 14 day s. b. Persons needing a second treatm ent 3\u20147 day s later. (See section H 8-9). c. Persons with crusted or infected lesions needing routine daily monitoring, m onthly scrapings for a few m onths or a m aintenance monthly treatm ent regim en.2 9. Notify all fam ilies and frequent visitors about problem s and need for their cooperation.1,2 H. Application of Scabicides and Steroid Creams 1. Treatm ent failures m ay occur for several reasons, the m ost com mon being inadequate application of scabicide.1,2,5,8,9,10 Other reasons for treatm ent failure include: a. Infected or crusted lesions. 1) Keratoly tic agents (20\u201440% urea and 6% salicy lic acid) m ay be necessary to soften scaliness and perm it penetration of scabicide.2,5,11 2) Concom itant bacterial infection should be treated with appropriate antibiotics and retreated for scabies a week or 10 days later.11 b. Reinfestation from untreated contacts9 c. Cell-m ediated m ites to the scabicide8,13,14 NOTE: Pruritus and rash can continue for 1-4 weeks after treatm ent. Pruritus and residual rash should not be considered treatm ent failure until 1 month after last treatm ent. To am eliorate these signs and sy mptoms, triam cinolone cream (0.1%-0.025%) applied to the m ost intense rash a nd a lubricating agent or em ollient to the lesser rash for children;15,16 1% hydrocortisone cream or triam cinolone cream used for adults as well.15 Antihistam ines are also used to a lleviate the hy persensitivity response. e. Steroid cream s should not be applied until after first scabicide treatm ent. Topical and sy stem ic steroids cause depression of delay ed hypersensitivity and pruritus, thus allowing scabies to go undetected and transm ission unim peded. 2. Gloves and gown are worn to apply scabicides. 3. Bathe as usual and change bed linens. 4. Apply scabicide to every square inch of skin, from the posterior ear folds down over entire body , including all non-affected areas. Include intergluteal cleft, navel, crevices contractured and webs between fingers and toes.11 If scabicide is washed off during handwashing or perineal care, it m ust be reapplied., 5. In infants, toddlers under 3 y ears of age, the elderly and the immunocom prom ised, the head (face and scalp) requires application of scabicide. Pay close attention to the area behind the ears. Do not get the scabicide near the eyes or m outh. Prior treatm ent failure m ay be an indication to include the head in other persons.2,11,16 Lindane sham poo, used as directed on the la bel, can be used for certain persons (elderly ) to treat the scalp. 6. Fingernails and toenails should be clipped and scabicide applied under nails. A small soft brush is helpful for this.2,17,18 7. Scabicides Elim ite is a trade nam e for this product. * Considered drug of choice by several authorities including the 1994 American Academ y of Pediatrics \"Red Book\" and the Medical Letter, March 23, 1990, p. 29 Cure rate in one study was 91% .10,14 1 application is considered cura tive, although 2 applications are frequently recom mended by experts for sy mptomatic persons. The usual adult dose is 30 gram s. A 60-gram tube should treat 2 adults. For adults, it should be m assaged into skin covering the entire body (except the head) from the soles of th e feet to the neck. For infants, young toddlers, and geriatric patients, it should be applied to the entire body including the scalp, neck tem ples and forehead because of the m ite often infests these areas in those age groups. The patient should be instructed to rem ove the m edication by thoroughly bathing 8-14 hours after application. Contact with the ey es and m outh should be voided. If contact occurs, the ey es should be im mediately flushed with water. Note: Studies have not dem onstrated plasm a levels. The drug is rapidly broken down and is excreted in urine as inactive m etabolites.6,19 Perm ethrin is safe for children 2 m onths of age and older. No instance of accidental ingestion has been reported. The m ost com monly reported side effects are pruritus, edem a and ery thema, which m ay continue for up to 2 weeks after treatm ent. Patients should be told that the itching or stinging of scabies infestation m ay continue after treatm ent, and should be advised to avoid repeated application of the scabicide. Although anim al studies showed no adverse effects to reproductive function or dam age to fetus, no adequate studies have been done on pregnant wom en. Therefore, perm ethrin should be used during pregnancy only when clearly necessary . If treatm ent is necessary for lactating m others, breast-feeding should be discontinued during the treatm ent period. b. 1% lindane lotion (com es in 2 oz . bottle) is effective when applied properly .9,11,20 The usual am ount of lindane lotion required to treat one adult once is 30 gram s (1 oz.).6 Lotion bottle m ust be shaken well. Bathe with tepid water, not hot wate r, if a bath is taken prior to application of scabicide. Leave on for 8 hours or overnight; som e physicians prefer a 12-24 hour application.5 Most absorption of lindane occurs in the first 6 hours after application.20 Avoid contact with ey es and m ucous m embranes. Not to be used for sm all infants, pregnant wom en or nursing mothers.10,20 Use of lindane for any reason in sm all children is seriously questioned by the National Pediculosis Association. Lindane should be avoided in any one with seizure disorders and in anyone with severe skin disrup tion (excoriated or denuded). If lindane is used for lactating m other, discontinue breast-feeding for 2 days.6 c. 6% precipitated sulfur in petrolatum prepared by pharm acy.15 Cure rate is unknown\u2014has not been studied, but used for centuries. Product is m essy, malodorous and som ewhat irritating. Apply nightly for 3 nights (wash off previous application before reapply ing a new application). 15 Recom mended in infants y ounger than 2 m onths of age and in pregnant or lactating wom en. 15 d. 10% crotam iton cream or lotion (Eurax* Cream or Lotion) has an approxim ate 50% cure rate when applied less than 5 day s,10,20,21,22 60% effective for full treatm ent. Cream must be thoroughly massaged into skin. Apply twice a day for 5 day s.10 Avoid contact with ey es and m ucous m embranes. Can be used on y oungsters and el derly with dry sensitive skin,5 but not denuded skin.20 8. Conventional scabies regim en a. A cream or 1% lindane is recom mended in facilities provided that application of scabicide is supervised by a professional health care worker who is knowledgeable about scabicide treatm ents. Several authorities claim that a single adequate application of 5% perm ethrin cream or 1% lindane is sufficient to eradicate conventional scabies, whether a diagnosed case, symptomatic case, or asy mptomatic contact.9,11 This has been effective in the clinical practice of treating individual fam ilies. b. Institutional scabies has a high propensity for transm ission. If supervised application of scabicide by trained em ployees is not possible, the following regim en is recom mended: Persons who are positively diagnosed by skin scrapings\u2014 3 treatm ents spaced 3-7 day s apart, utilizing 2 different agents2 Reevaluate at 14 and 28 day s. Symptomatic cases who' s skin was not scraped or scraping was negative\u2014 2 treatm ents, 3-7 day s a part.2,5,11 reevaluate at 14 and 28 day s Asymptom atic contacts, include household and sexual contacts, of diagnosed or sy mptomatic cases\u2014 1 treatm ent, evaluate in 14 day s2 c. It should be acknowledged that so me clinicians prefer to treat symptomatic individuals with two a pplications on two consecutive day s. 9. Norwegian Scabies (aty pical, crusted) regim en a. Aggressive treatm ent over entire body .1 (See H # 1-6) b. 5% perm ethrin cream for 1 day , followed by 10% crotam iton lotion for 5 days, followed by a second 5% perm ethrin cream for 1 day .2,5,8 c. Reasses on day s 7 through 14 with follow-up scrapings in one m onth.2 If scrapings are positive or if sy mptoms unabated, treat again. d. If treatm ent failure occurs several tim es, m onthly maintenance treatm ents should be given for an extended period of tim e; (e.g., applications of 10% crotam iton lotion for 2 day s each m onth.2,8) e. Protective gown and gloves are necessary until scrapings are negative on 3 separate occasions. f. Categorize contacts by risk of m ite transm ission1 1) High risk: prolonged or recurrent hands-on contact before initiation of patient treatm ent, 2 treatm ents, 3-7 day s apart. 2) Low risk: persons having had i ndirect contact (touching patient's clothing or linens); a sim ple, brief period of direct skin to skin contact (obtaining a blood specim en, positioning a patient for radiography ); or a patient who was cared for by an em ployee who also cared for the scabetic patient. 1 treatm ent 3) No risk: person having had neither direct nor indirect contact require no treatm ent. 10. Cleansing bath is taken when product is to be rem oved. Som e experts do not believe it is necessary to bathe residents at designated tim es in order to rem ove scabicide. Estes and Estes suggest that an extended interval before bathing or repeated applications be considered to offset reinfestation.6 11. Fresh clean linens and clothes are put on after the cleansing bath. I. Isolation and Environmental Control for conventional Scabies 1. Environm ental reservoirs were considered to play little or no role in scabies transm ission until late 1988. Since then, Arlian and colleagues have demonstrated that S. scabiei can rem ain alive for 3 day s on stuffed chairs, sofas and tiled floors. He found that ny mphs could survive 2\u20145 day s at 25\u00b0C and 45- 75% relative hum idity. Outbreak reports im plicate bed linens and clothes as probable sources of transm ission.23 2. Isolate affected patients/residents during the treatm ent period or for 24 hours after initiation of scabicide such as 5% perm ethrin cream or 1% lindane lotion; 24 hours after last application of other scabicides; restriction of contact with other persons\u2014restrict to room or hom e.5 3. Wear gown and gloves for skin to skin contact. Wash hands after rem oval of gloves.1 4. Bed linens, towels and clothes used by the affected persons within 72 hours prior to treatm ent should be placed in plastic bags inside the patient' s room , handled by glove and gowned laundry worker s and laundered at 50\u00b0C (122\u00b0F).1,23,24 Hot cycle of dry er should be used for at least 10\u201420 m inutes. Nonwashable blankets and articles can be placed in a plastic bag for 7 day s or dry cleaned or tum bled in a hot dry er for 20 m inutes.26 5. All bed linens, towels and clothes should be changed daily . 6. Multiple-use walking belts, skin cream s and ointm ents can serve as potential reservoirs for m ites. Disinfect the walking belt and discard all cream s, lotions or ointm ents used prior to effective treatm ent.25,26 7. Mattresses, upholstered furniture and carpeting should be vacuum ed. 8. Routine disinfection procedures are adequate on a daily basis.1 9. Symptomatic em ployees should be allowed back to work the m orning following overnight treatm ent with 5% perm ethrin cream or 1% lindane. Disposable gloves should be worn for 2\u20143 day s by symptomatic staff who m ust provide extensive hands-on care to their patients. 1 J. Isolation and Environmental Co ntrol for Norwegian Scabies- Measures rem ain in place until skin scrapi ngs are negative on 3 consecutive occasions. 1. Assign patient/resident to a private room . 1 2. Restrict contact with visitors until tr eatm ent regim en com pleted and scrapings are negative for live m ites. Alternatively , visitors m ust take the sam e precautions (wearing a gown and gloves) as em ployees.1,2,27 3. Cohort em ployees to care this patient/resident only (no other direct care responsibilities) until effective treatm ent is com pleted. Other duties for these employees can include record keeping and filing. 1 4. Wear gown and gloves to attend to patient needs, for housekeeping duties and handling of laundry .28 5. Spray insect repellent (py rethins) to wrist (edge of the glove and ribbing of sleeve area), arm s and front of gown. Rem ove before leaving the room . Wash hands. 6. Upholstered furniture covered with cloth fabric should be rem oved from the room or replaced with furniture covered in plastic or viny l. Mattresses m ust be covered with plastic or viny l. 1 7. The patient's room should be vacuum ed daily with a vacuum cleaner designated for this room alone. 1 8. Routine disinfection procedures s hould follow thorough vacuum ing on a daily basis and upon discharge of the patient from the room . 9. Utilize any other appropriate protocol s such as given in subsections 4\u20146 under Enviornm ental Control for Conventional Scabies. *The identification of trade nam es does not im ply endorsem ent by the Missouri Departm ent of Health.

INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES Appendix D Definitions of Scabies Infestations Conventional scabies: average 10-15 mites at any given time, although only 1\u20142 mites may be recovered in scrapings, (frequently none are obser ved); occurs in physically healthy persons.1,2 Severe scabies : A typical crusted scabies: usually a tota l of 3\u20146 mites and 8\u201412 eggs observed on 5\u20147 slides; do not exhibit hyperkeratotic cuta neous response because of decreased cell mediated immunity; some lack pruritus; occurs in nursing home residents and elderly with coexistent chronic diesease; moderate to high risk of transmission. 6 Norwegian scabies: Typical crusted or keratotic: thousands of mites at any given time; multiple live mites, eggs, and scybala (fecal pellets) observed on almost every slide; have hyperkeratotic skin; occurs in debilitated, immunosupressed, advanced chronic disease and mentally handicapped. High risk of transmission is high from skin and formite contact. (Exfoliating skin scales harbor enormous numbers of mites which are shed onto linens, furniture, and carpeting). 1,2,5,7 Nodular scabies: pruritic nodules, apparently due to hypersen sitivity persisting for weeks to a year or longer, despite scabicidal therapy, but eventually clear spontaneously: may regress with the use of corticosteroids; surgical excision sometimes i ndicated if patient concerned and intralesional cortisosteroids ineffective.5 Pseudoscabies: scrapings always negative; fostered by residual pruitus in effectively treated cases and by conversations between misinformed persons.1-5 Canine-transmitted scabies: caused by the Sarcoptes scabiei var canis species of mite from dogs; the mite does not reproduce or complete its life cycle on humans and thus burrows are not created; not usually transmitted person to person.

Guidelines for Investigation of Gastrointestinal Illness DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SECTION OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL AND VETERINARY PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDELINES FOR INVESTIGATION OF GASTROINTESTINAL ILLNESS OF UNDETERMINED ORIGIN IN LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES INFECTION CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES Guidelines for Investigation of Gastrointestinal Illness Of Undetermined Origin in Long Term Care Facilities This is a guideline for initiating the very first steps of an outbreak investigation of gastrointestinal illness in a long-term care facility. The following sequence of action steps should facilitate a prompt and effective investigation. I. Use the attached investigation form (Attachme nt A) to answer the most basic, preliminary questions related to an outbreak of a gastrointestinal illness. II. Consult with the Section of Communicable Disease Control and Veterinary Public Health (district coordinator or central office), shar ing as much of the information from the above mentioned form as possible. III. Arrange for stool (and possibly blood) specimen collection using the procedures outlined below. IV. Develop a hypothesis utilizing the following general principles: 1. If symptoms develop on one floor and m ove to other floors in a rapid progressive fashion, suspect person-to-person transmission. 2. If there are symptomatic cases distributed on multiple units within a 12 hour period, suspect a common food source. Request the facility distribute the employee questionnaire to foodhandlers and proceed with a foodborne investigation. V. Proceed with a foodborne outbreak investigation (Attachment B) if suspected. VI. Obtain information on control measures to prevent further cases. VII. Share control measures with persons who need to know and implement them. VIII. Create outbreak line-listing (Attachment C). IX. When outbreak controlled, complete a nd submit the nosocomial outbreak report from (Attachment D). General Guidelines for Specimen Collection and Testing Request that the facility's medical director or his/her designee be responsible for coordinating the ordering of diagnostic tests. Be sure that each specimen container is labele d with the person's name and the date specimen was collected. They will be thrown away if there is no label. Whenever the causative organism is unknown during initial investigation, two specimens should be collected from each symptomatic person, one for potential viral testing at the Missouri State Public Health Laboratory (MSPHL) and/or Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and one for bacteriology testing at the MSPHL. The laboratory will set up an outbreak kit that will include the following per patient: 1. One set of collection vials (one with and one without transport media). 2. Two patient forms (one for viral testing and one for bacterial testing). 3. One specimen outbreak bag (with side pocket for both forms). 4. Patient instructions/institutional instructions. 5. Individual/multi mailer with cold packs and labels. All specimens should be transported cold to MSPHL by quickest possible means. Stool Specimens and Blood Specimens for Viral Testing 1. Stool Specimens - collect from 10 or more persons Liquid stool specimens should be collected within 72 hours of symptom onset. Utilize plastic wrap over the back portion of the toile t seat/commode or a freshly sanitized bedpan in order to collect the specimens. Collect at least 10cc of liquid stool. Stool for viral testing must be placed in the vial or container that does not contain transport media. (Alternatively, in an emergency, dump out media in some enteric vials or use a urine specimen cup. The specimen container must be labeled, \"For viral testing.\") The patient's name and collection date must also be on the container. a. If symptoms and epidemiologic data indicate an illness of viral origin, all stools will be tested for rotavirus and adenovirus #1 - 41 at the Missouri State Public Health Laboratory. Concurrently, a minimum of 10% of the bacteriology specimens in transport media will be screened for bacterial organisms ( Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, E. coli O157:H7 or others as requested). b. Stools from a minimum of 10, persons along with paired serum specimens on the same persons submitting stools, are necessary for electron microscope testing for Norwalk-like viruses, calicivirus, astrovirus, etc., at CDC. The stool specimens should be stored in the refrigerator at +4 0C or 390F. They must not be frozen because freezing destroys the characteristic viral morphology that permits a diagnosis by electron microscopy. c. Because of the low probability that enter oviruses are causative, enterovirus testing of stool specimens should not be requested in long term care outbreaks of gastroenteritis. 2. Blood Specimens - collect from 10 persons If both viral and bacterial tests on stools done at MSPHL are negative, the contact persons from the Section of Communicable Disease Control and Veterinary Public Health will call the CDC to see if they will run specimens for Norwalk-like viruses. If the answer is 'yes' then collect 10 acute bloods from the same persons that contributed stool specimens for viral testing. Obtain 10cc of blood in red top (no anticoagulant) tube within 5 days of onset to accompany stool for electron microscope testing. The state lab will centrifuge the blood. Obtain a convalescent blood specimen from the same persons 3-6 weeks after the first blood specimen. Acute and convalescent bloods should be at least 3 weeks apart. Stool Specimens for Bacterial Testing Collect stool specimens from 10 or more persons for bacteriology tests. Transfer at least 10cc of stool from the collection site (plastic wr ap over the back portion of the toilet seat or a freshly sanitized bedpan) into the vial with Cary-Blair transport media . This vial for bacteriology testing must be labeled, \"Bacti\" along with the patient's name and date collected. When symptoms and epidemiological data indicat e illness of bacterial origin, all specimens in transport media will be tested for Salmonella , Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia , and E. coli O157:H7 . Concurrently, a minimum of 10% of the viral specimens will be screened for rotavirus and adenovirus. Note: If the suspect organism is either Clostridium or Bacillus species, the stool specimen in the vial without transport media will be used for testing. Further Processing of Stool Specimens If either of the 10% screenings (bacterial or vi ral) turn up positive, the rest of the patient samples will be tested for that specific organism. If the field person is unable to determine whethe r the suspected causative agent is bacterial or viral, the laboratory will run the specimens for both viral and bacterial agents in consultation with the Section of Communicable Disease Control and Veterinary Public Health. (If the number of specimens is very large, the Section of Communicable Disease Control and Veterinary Public Health and the laboratory may decide on a certain percentage to be screened initially.) Additional information on specific organisms can be found in the Communicable Disease Policy and Procedure Manual - Foodbor ne Section, Subsection 3.0. Request forms The requesting forms should state 'outbreak.' They should state name of the ill person, date, and to whom the results are to be reported. If the Section of Communicable Disease Control and Veterinary Public Health (CDCVPH) communicable disease coordinator or the county health department is to receive the reports, their name should be listed on each form. No letter of justification is needed form the CDCVPH for testing outbreak specimens without a charge. If the facility is to receive the reports, list its name on each form. A letter is needed from the CDCVPH to justify having outbreak specimens tested at no charge to the facility. If the ill person's private physician receives the report, each test will be charged to the physician.
