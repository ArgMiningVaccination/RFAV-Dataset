However, home remedies are in no way a substitute for alcohol detox from a healthcare provider. It's not recommended for those who have developed an alcohol dependence to stop drinking abruptly, or quit \" [cold turkey](https://www.arkbh.com/alcohol/withdrawal/cold-turkey/).\" Although medical professionals should address severe alcohol withdrawal, here are 10 home remedies that could help ease your symptoms. 1. Meditation Heavy alcohol use can cause a wide array of side effects and even affect your brain chemistry. This can lead to mental health issues such as [depression](https://www.arkbh.com/alcohol/withdrawal/symptoms/depression/) and anxiety. Those experiencing withdrawal symptoms may discover that meditation can provide solace and benefit mental health. Meditation can help with stress relief at home but may also be part of a professional treatment program. 2. Mindfulness By practicing mindfulness, you can become more aware of yourself and your surroundings. Taking the time to practice mindfulness may help you become more in-tune with your body and current withdrawal symptoms. 3. Yoga Learning how to breathe in deeply, release, and focus your mind may help decrease alcohol cravings. Yoga provides a quiet time to relax and put your mind at ease. Meditation and yoga go hand-in-hand, so it's no coincidence that these two are often done together. 4. Acupuncture Another natural remedy for alcohol withdrawal is acupuncture. If you receive acupuncture, needles are inserted at specific and strategic points on your body. This helps restore balance to your dopamine levels, which may also curb your desire to drink alcohol. 5. Vitamins Vitamins are an excellent resource that can help you throughout the withdrawal process. Since common withdrawal symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea, vitamins can help supplement the nutrients you've lost. Some of the vitamins and minerals you may want to consume include: - magnesium - potassium - calcium - vitamin B - vitamin C 6. Milk Thistle Milk thistle is an herb that contains the antioxidant silymarin. This type of herb may help restore liver health from damage caused by heavy drinking. The herb acts as a protectant for the liver, which is an important organ used for bile production, vitamin storage, and other functions. 7. Kudzu Kudzu is a Chinese herb. This leguminous plant may be used as a natural remedy to help decrease your alcohol consumption. Studies have shown that using the kudzu extract in the form of a pill may help reduce beer intake. It also showed that those who took kudzu didn't drink as quickly as others. Those experiencing withdrawal may use kudzu as a way to decrease their alcohol intake. This can lead you to drink less or stop drinking which can prevent or ease withdrawal symptoms. 8. Fluids Another important remedy that you can do on your own when going through alcohol withdrawal is replenishing your fluids. For those who develop symptoms that cause you to lose fluids, you'll want to drink as much water as you can. Other drinks rich in electrolytes can also help provide the balance you need. 9. Group Therapy & Counseling Not only will you develop physical withdrawal symptoms, you may have increased anxiety as well. Your mental health is just as important as your physical health during withdrawal. Various forms of [therapy](https://www.arkbh.com/therapy/), counseling, and [support groups](https://www.arkbh.com/levels-of-care/support-groups/) can give you a safe space to discuss any anxiety and depression you're currently feeling. 10. Light Therapy Phototherapy, also known as light therapy, involves exposing the person to a certain amount of light during the day. Because alcohol withdrawal sometimes includes [insomnia](https://www.arkbh.com/alcohol/withdrawal/symptoms/insomnia/) and other sleeping problems, this exposure light therapy can help you achieve a more natural sleep cycle. Medical Detox For Alcohol Addiction If you're experiencing withdrawal symptoms because you've tried to decrease your amount of alcohol intake, it's advised that you undergo [detoxification](https://www.arkbh.com/levels-of-care/detox/) at a rehab center. Withdrawal symptoms, like [delirium tremens](https://www.arkbh.com/alcohol/withdrawal/symptoms/delirium-tremens/) or [alcohol withdrawal syndrome](https://www.arkbh.com/alcohol/withdrawal/), can be severe and even become life-threatening if untreated. [Inpatient](https://www.arkbh.com/levels-of-care/inpatient-rehab/) or [outpatient](https://www.arkbh.com/levels-of-care/outpatient/) detox can help alleviate symptoms and prepare you for [professional rehab programs](https://www.arkbh.com/alcohol/treatment/).
