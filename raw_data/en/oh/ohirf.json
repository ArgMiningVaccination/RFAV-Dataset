Neuronal Ca2+ signals, with slower altered dynamics, occur upon stimulation of metabotropic receptors followed by IP3-mediated intracellular Ca2+ release and store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). An understanding of how such IP3/Ca2+ signals regulate gene expression is lacking in part because a Ca2+ responsive NFAT ortholog is absent in Drosophila. A series of transcriptomic screens in Drosophila neurons2,3 helped identify gene families whose expression is regulated by the IP3R and key components of SOCE. IP3/Ca2+ signals and SOCE-driven neuronal gene expression functions in different contexts ranging from the larval to pupal transition2, flight circuit maturation3, and others4. I have investigated putative transcriptional mechanisms by which IP3/Ca2+ signaling and SOCE regulate the expression of genes in pupal and adult neurons. In a recent study, we have shown that Set2, the Histone 3 lysine 36 methyltransferase forms part of a transcriptional feedback loop in a larval glutamatergic neuron subset to regulate the larval to pupal transition upon nutrient stress5. Another context in which we investigate the role of Set2 downstream of SOCE is in a subset of pupal and adult dopaminergic neurons required for maturation and function of the Drosophila flight circuit. To bridge the gap between Ca2+ signals and the expression of specific genes, including Set2, I have analyzed the upstream regions of genes targeted by SOCE and identified potential binding sites for the homeotic transcription factor GAF. This work identifies a critical developmental window wherein a novel signaling axis mediated by GAF and Set2 acts downstream of SOCE in a set of dopaminergic neurons. This pathway targets the expression of specific voltage-gated ion-channel genes to regulate neuronal excitability and affect flight bout durations. In summary, these findings identify a Ca2+ responsive transcription factor in Drosophila neurons that amplifies changes in gene expression profiles through an activating histone modifier.

POC diagnostics empowered the primary care providers and enabled them with better clinical decisions. POC diagnosis by common Lateral flow (LF) assays typically utilizes the visually read reporters, such as gold particles, which read qualitative (i.e. yes/no) result cartridges with low sensitivity. To improve sensitivity and develop quantitative LF assays, we replaced the visual reporters with fluorescent reporters to detect different biomarkers by using an instrument. Fluorescent reporters-based lateral flow assays have obtained great value since they significantly improve the sensitivity of the biomarker with the quantitative analysis, and still maintain the advantages of being affordable, rapid, simple, and portable when compared with the common lateral flow assay. Multiple fluorescent reporters such as fluorescent dyes, and lanthanide labels have promoted the development of Fluorescent lateral flow assay. In this presentation, I will discuss the development and evaluation of different fluorescent reporters used in the LF and their specific properties as well as signal enhancement techniques using the carbohydrate-binding module, Fragmented antibodies, cellulose-based test membrane, cellulose nanofiber, Graphene oxide and Multiwall carbon nanotubes helping to enhance detection performance. Along with that we have used these sensitive and accurate fluorescent labels for the development of fluorescent lateral flow assay to detect biomarkers for a cardiovascular disorders, chronic kidney diseases, mild-Trauma Brain Injury, and cancer. This presentation will also cover the multiplex assay development and the cell-free protein production system using the leishmaniasis lysate. | | Microbial recognition by the pattern recognition receptors of the innate immune system results in transcriptional induction of pro-inflammatory gene program that is critical for host protection. The PRR induced inflammatory cytokines play an important role in mobilization of innate immune responses as well as activation of adaptive immunity However, many of the same innate inflammatory cytokines are also drivers of pathology in T cell mediated auto-immune diseases and during T cell targeted cancer immunotherapies. Although blocking individual cytokines can mitigate some pathology, the upstream mechanisms governing overabundant innate inflammatory cytokine production in T cell drive pathology have been less clear. Recent work from my laboratory has led to the discovery that cognate interactions between effector memory CD4 T cells and myeloid cells leads to induction of an inflammatory transcriptional profile in the innate immune system that is reminiscent of, yet entirely independent of, classical pattern recognition receptor activation. We have identified critical signaling nodes that are engaged by effector memory CD4 T cells to mobilize a broad proinflammatory program in myeloid cells. Cytokine storms and toxicity as well as autoimmune pathology can be completely rescued by interfering with these signaling nodes in multiple models of T cell driven inflammation suggesting that T cell instruction of the innate immune system is a primary driver of sterile inflammation and immunopathology. While these pathways might have evolved as a mechanism of host protection during reinfection by virulent pathogens, they contribute to destructive inflammation and pathology during T cell driven diseases. Specific signaling nodes and implications for therapeutic interventions will be discussed. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Precise neuronal function is the key to a proper functional brain. But as simple as it seems, it is regulated by a variety of signals impinging on various parts of a single neuron. These signals represent particular stimuli and modulate neuronal function. Hence, neuronal output is the function of multiple inputs computed together through various logics for eliciting an appropriate response. Calcium (Ca2+) signalling is one of the ways with which external inputs operate inside the neuron. These signals operate through various Ca2+ puffs or waves of different amplitudes and frequencies to convey required messages. Ca2+ hence emerges as a universal signalling molecule to regulate various cellular functions like fertilisation, proliferation, gene transcription, neurotransmission. Its cellular presence is regulated by various channels and pumps to accurately maintain spatiotemporal Ca2+ concentration. Inositol trisphosphate Receptor (IP3R) is one of the proteins that regulate intracellular Ca2+ signalling in response to extracellular stimuli. Extracellular stimuli activate G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) to generate second messengers like Inositol trisphosphate (IP3) that binds to the IP3R on endoplasmic reticular (ER) membranes and mediate release of Ca2+ from the ER. Reported autosomal dominant mutations in IP3R1 cause Spinocerebellar ataxia 29, characterized by cerebellar atrophy, ataxia and cognitive impairment. Studies have shown that these mutations decrease Ca2+ release from the ER. However, downstream cellular mechanism(s) by which IP3Rs modulate neuronal function for specific behaviours remain speculative, in vertebrates and invertebrates. Previous genetic studies in Drosophila have revealed a role of IP3R mediated Ca2+ signalling in the formation and regulation of flight circuit. I used Drosophila neurons as a model system to understand the neuronal functions of IP3R mediated Ca2+ release. I generated an inducible dominant negative form of the IP3R (IP3RDN). Flies with neuronal expression of IP3RDN exhibit flight deficits. I used IP3RDN to identify key flight-modulating dopaminergic neurons with axonal projections in the mushroom body. Flies with attenuated IP3RDN in these dopaminergic neurons exhibit shortened flight bouts and a disinterest in seeking food. Further experiments showed reduced excitability as well as reduced dopamine release upon cholinergic stimulation as underlying cellular mechanisms. Findings in the thesis suggest that various neuromodulatory signals received by these neurons stimulate IP3/Ca2+ signals to regulate pre-synaptic cellular physiology with significant impact on flight and feeding behavior. I further investigated another IP3R dependent flight regulatory mechanism independent of dopaminergic neurons. It showed role of IP3R in neuropeptidergic neurons to release Insulin-like peptide (dILP3) to regulate flight bout durations. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Activity dependent synaptic structural changes is a key mechanism underlying learning and memory. With advances in high throughput sequencing technologies and functional profiling methods, multiple long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been linked with neurobiological processes related with learning and memory, as well as with disorders that lead to memory impairments. However, their specific roles in synapse function and plasticity are poorly understood. I will discuss the physiological regulation of sub-cellular expression, mechanism, and functions of lncRNAs in synaptic structural plasticity. | | Organ transplantation remains the only life-saving procedure for many end-stage organ failures, but is associated with two rate-limiting factors. Firstly, to find a suitable donor (other than in cases of identical twins) is very difficult and severely restricted in availability. Secondly, all patients undergoing transplantation are subjected to immunosuppression using a cocktail of drugs that often results in a high degree of susceptibility to opportunistic infections and malignancies. Similarly, patients suffering from autoimmune disorders are currently being treated with non-selective immunosuppressive therapies thereby greatly increasing the risk for infections and cancer. Using a mouse model of coronin 1 deficiency, we have been analyzing the role of T cells and coronin 1 signaling in generation of immune responses against allo-antigenic, auto-antigenic and pathogenic stimuli. In my presentation, I will provide some exciting data that shows coronin 1 deficiency could be used to promote allograft tolerance, suppress autoimmune diseases and at the same time preserve anti-pathogen responses. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Microbial cells need to make decisions crucial for their survival. Microbes also often exist in collectives such as populations and communities. The interactions between individual decision-making microbes in such collectives result in emergent properties and vital microbial functions. The population-level phenomena in turn influence the evolution of individual decision-making ability. Connecting these two scales is a vital challenge in the study of microbial life. My thesis focuses on mathematical modeling approaches to connect these regimes in two different biological systems: (i) Temperate phage-bacteria systems like lambda phage and its host, E.coli, and (ii) the budding yeast, S. cerevisiae. The first part of my thesis tries to explain the surprisingly narrow range of a complex decision-making phenotype across a variety of temperate phages. Temperate phages have two modes of propagation upon infection - (i) lysis, where the host cell dies releasing hundreds of phage particles, and (ii) lysogeny, where the phage\u00e2s genome integrates with the host\u00e2s. The choice between the two outcomes depends on how the host physiology interacts with complex genetic circuits encoded on the phage genome. A simplified view of the decision defines lysogenic propensity as the chance that an infected cell will become lysogenic. The range of observed lysogenic propensities is just 5-15%, despite the diversity of phages. To explain this narrow range, we suggest that the population dynamics of phage-bacteria infections might exert an optimising pressure on the lysogenic propensity. We combined Lotka-Volterra equations and game theory to model competitive infections to search for optimal lysogeny phenotypes. We identified the optima and found that our predicted range coincided with experimentally reported values. Bolstered by this result, we derived a mathematical expression for lysogeny by analyzing the infection dynamics [1]. For the next part of my thesis, I collaborated with Dr. Sunil Laxman\u00e2s group to investigate the unexpected emergence and spatial self-organization of metabolically distinct subpopulations in isogenic S.cerevisiae colonies. Preliminary observations in Sunil\u00e2s lab showed that glycolytic cells emerged in mature colonies grown under low glucose conditions, a novel finding. To piece together the biochemical and fluorescence-based experimental evidence, I designed a discrete spatial model of the colony. The model, albeit phenomenological, suggested simple local rules of metabolic resource sharing, resource diffusion, and metabolic switching that were sufficient to explain the patterns of colony development. The model also made predictions about the dynamics of switching and metabolic resource budgeting that the experimentalists verified [2, 3].

Data and Democracy How statistics and democracy shape each other in India Rukmini S Friday, July 15 2022. 5:00pm. (Haapus), NCBS Details: https://bit.ly/apls-data India's statistical architecture was a product of the post-colonial moment, and the dreams and imperatives of the founding moment were reflected in its structure. How has that compact weathered the storms of independent India's democratic churn, and does India's statistical edifice still serve India and Indians well? What will it take for data to deepen Indian democracy? Drawing on 15 years of experience of the working of the levers of democracy, as well as a ringside view of the political economy of Indian data, independent data journalist Rukmini S reflects upon the role that data has played in our understanding of the current moment, as well as what the data misses.

In contrast, macrophage dysfunction leads to multiple diseases, including cancer and fibrosis. Until recently, researchers have only focused on the influence and mechanisms of soluble and diffusible cues on macrophage function and behavior. However, throughout the body, macrophages encounter and reside in tissues with a wide range of physical properties that can modulate their function. Therefore, we wanted to understand the role of mechanical cues, especially substrate stiffness, from the extracellular matrix (ECM) onto which macrophages remain anchored in modulating their behavior during wound healing. Here, we identified YAP as a crucial molecule sensing substrate stiffness and controlling inflammation in macrophages. Further, we found that manipulating the biomaterial stiffness alters the inflammatory state and YAP signaling in macrophages. This study will help identify strategies to suppress the inflammation during diseases and design immunomodulatory biomaterials. | | | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Macromolecular phase separation is thought to underlie the spatial and temporal organization of cellular matter. Of particular relevance is the formation and dissolution of membraneless bodies, known as biomolecular condensates, at the right place and time.

However, the cellular basis that detects the transient dopamine signaling has long been unclear. Using two-photon microscopy and optogenetics, I have shown that transient increases and decreases of dopamine modulate plasticity of dopamine D1 and D2 receptor-expressing cells in the nucleus accumbens, respectively. At a behavioral level, I characterized that these D1 and D2 cells cooperatively tune learning by generalization and discrimination learning. Interestingly, disturbance of the dopamine signaling impaired D2 cell plasticity and discrimination learning, which was analogous to salience misattribution seen in people with schizophrenia. | | Nearly 70% of all breast cancers are thought to be driven by the hormone estrogen. Despite effective hormonal therapies targeting the Estrogen Receptor (ER), resistance to therapy is common, leading to fatal disease. ER is a transcription factor that can both activate and repress genes upon stimulation by its ligand. Its binding patterns are known to be dramatically reprogrammed in tumors, compared to normal mammary epithelial cells. ER binding patterns have been shown to further change in metastatic disease. What directs ER to assume these differing roles is unclear. Pioneer factors such as FOXA1 are thought to be one mechanism that influence activity of hormone receptors like ER. Pioneer factors have the innate ability to open condensed chromatin and allow ER to bind and introduce transcriptional changes. We discovered that in addition to FOXA1, KLF4 is a pioneer factor that is required for ER binding. KLF4 has been established to be a pioneer factor in pluripotent stem cells and is one of four transcription factors required for stem cell reprogramming. Our preliminary results indicate that silencing of KLF4 leads to a subset of ER binding at a subset of it sites, coinciding with reduced chromatin accessibility at these regions and loss of ER driven gene expression changes. Imaging studies have previously shown that ER forms distinct foci or nuclear condensate structures. These structures thought to play a role in maintaining higher order chromatin formation and important in recruiting of transcriptional machinery. We observe that that KLF4 is required to maintain these foci in a subset of ER+ cells, indicating a role in maintaining chromatin structure. In addition to KLF4's chromatin functions, we observe that silencing of KLF4 disrupts transcriptional heterogeneity at the single-cell level, indicating that the factor may impart a level of plasticity to cancer cells. We hypothesize that our multi-faceted studies will uncover he role of KLF4 in breast tumorigenesis and regulating ER and chromatin function. We anticipate that our studies will help identify novel therapeutic targets to treat breast cancer. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Animals and humans replay neural patterns encoding trajectories through their environment, both whilst they solve decision-making tasks and during rest. Under a common assumption that we build models of the world and recognize and plan actions using those models, such intrinsically generated patterns are ideal for various forms of model inversion, giving us access to fast and effective methods for sensory processing and decision-making. I will discuss recent investigations using magnetoencephalography to detect replay in human subjects as they perform decision-making tasks. In a simple choice task, we found evidence for various forms of replay, which differed between subjects who flexibly adjusted their choices to changes in temporal, spatial and reward structure and those who were slower to adapt to change. The former group predominantly replayed comparatively less good trajectories during task performance, and subsequently avoided these inefficient choices. The latter replayed comparatively preferred, but suboptimal, trajectories during rest periods between task epochs. We suggest that online and offline replay both contribute to planning, but each are associated with distinct model-based and model-free decision strategies. This is joint work with Eran Eldar, Zeb Kurth-Nelson, Ray Dolan, GeorgyAntonov and Chris Gagne. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| The ability of neurons to respond differentially to specific temporal and spatial patterns of stimulation underlies the storage of memory and information in neural circuits. Synaptic plasticity, the experience-induced change in connections between neurons, conveys this abililty to neurons. Most of our understanding of synaptic plasticity derives from in vitro experiments with precisely repeated stimulus patterns; however, neurons exhibit significant variability in vivo during repeated experiences and experience a diversity of inhibitory inputs. Further, the spatial pattern of synaptic inputs to the dendritic tree influences synaptic plasticity, yet is not considered in most synaptic plasticity rules. Here, we investigate how spatiotemporal synaptic input patterns produce plasticity with in vivo-like conditions using a data-driven computational model with a plasticity rule based on calcium dynamics. Our synaptic plasticity rule, based on amplitude and duration of calcium transients, can correctly predict the direction of synaptic plasticity for both spike-timing and frequency-based stimulation protocols. A novel and important function of inhibition is to enhance the difference in calcium between stimulated and non-stimulated, i.e., to enhance synaptic specificity. Using in vivo spike train recordings as inputs, we show that plasticity is strongly robust to trial-to-trial variability of spike timing. In addition, we derive general synaptic plasticity rules describing how spatiotemporal patterns of synaptic inputs control the magnitude and direction of plasticity. Synapses that strongly potentiated had greater firing rates and calcium concentration later in the trial. Spike timing alone could not predict changes in synaptic strength. Coordination of firing between neurons was critical, as shuffling the inter-spike intervals eliminated strong potentiation. The neighboring synaptic activity influences the direction and magnitude of synaptic plasticity, with small clusters of spines producing the greatest increase in synaptic strength. Together, our results reveal that calcium dynamics can unify diverse plasticity rules and reveal how spatiotemporal firing rate patterns control synaptic plasticity. | | Error-free chromosome segregation during cell division is essential for accurate organismal growth and development. Defective chromosome segregation often results in aneuploidy, a chromosomal numerical aberration implicated in cancer and congenital disabilities. Establishing, monitoring and ensuring the correct physical attachment of chromosomes to the centromeric chromatin and subsequent establishment of chromosome bi-orientation are essential requirements for accurate chromes segregation. However, molecular and structural level mechanistic understanding of these crucial processes is not well understood. In this presentation, I will discuss our ongoing integrative structure-function efforts to unravel the mechanisms of error-free chromosome segregation. 11:30 AM, Monday, Aug 01, 2022 | Haapus (LH1)Seminar by Prof Sridhar Hannenhalli on 'Expression and Cellular plasticity in Cancer and development ' 04:00 PM, Tuesday, Aug 02, 2022 | Haapus (LH1)Seminar by Gilad Silberberg on Dr Vatsala Thirumalai on 'Drawing links between cellular, network and behavioral effects of neuromodulation ' 02:00 PM, Thursday, Aug 04, 2022 | neocortical model the effects of cholinergic release' 04:00 PM, Thursday, Aug 04, striatal glutamatergic signaling in behavioral flexibility' 10:15 AM, Tuesday, Aug 09, 2022 | InstemAuditorium100SeaterTalk by Dr Vinay Tergaonkar on 'Alternate facts on the road to immortality' 11:30 AM, Tuesday, Aug 09, 2022 | DasheriSeminar by Dr Tara Thiagarajan on 'Understanding Our Collective Humanity From Brain to Mind' 11:30 AM, Tuesday, Aug 09, 2022 | Haapus (LH1)Seminar Dr Advait M Jukar extinctions in India: how much do we know?' 11:30 AM, Thursday, Aug 11, 2022 | Haapus (LH1)Talk Dr of cytoplasmic dynein in cellulo reveals the mechanism of motor activation and cargo capture' 10:15 AM, Tuesday, Aug 16, 2022 | Haapus Simons Talk by microbial phototroph-heterotroph PM, Friday, Aug 19, 2022 | Remote VCTalk by Dr Wei Rao on 'Do You See What We See?
