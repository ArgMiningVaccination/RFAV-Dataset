Cholera reappeared in Haiti in October, 2010 after decades of absence. Cases were first detected in Artibonite region and in the ensuing months the disease spread to every department in the country. The rateof increase in the number of cases at the start of epidemics provides valuable information about the basicreproductive number ( < 0). Quantitative analysis of such data gives useful information for planning and evaluating disease control interventions, including vaccination. Using a mathematical model, we fitted data on the cumulative number of reported hospitalized cholera cases in Haiti. <0varied by department, ranging from 1.06 to 2.63. At a national level, 46% vaccination coverage would result in an ( <0),1, which would suppress transmission. In the current debate on the use of cholera vaccines in endemic and non-endemic regions, ourresults suggest that moderate cholera vaccine coverage would be an important element of disease control inHaiti. Acholera outbreak was confirmed in Haiti on October 21, 2010 by the National Laboratory of Public Health of the Ministry of Public Health and Population (MSPP). Cholera had not been documented in Haiti for decades, and outbreaks had been thought unlikely after the earthquake on 12 January 20101. Cholera was heralded in the Artibonite region, a rural area north of Port-au-Prince, followed in the ensuing months by spread of the disease throughout the country. Spread was facilitated by the earthquake-related disruptions to water andsewage facilities and damage to a local public health infrastructure that was already weak 1. Haiti's populations were immunologically na \u00a8ve to cholera after its long absence, so the potential for a severe cholera epidemic was high, much like recent cholera epidemics in Zimbabwe and other emerging epidemic-prone regions. Following the initial epidemic wave, there were also concerns about the possibility of cholera establishing long-term endemicity in Haiti, marked by the traditional recurrent seasonal epidemics that are characteristic of the disease. There is an increasing appreciation of the utility of mathematical models in informing public health policy, both in the emergency situation of an initial cholera epidemic2-6(Table 1), and in long-term public health management of seasonal epidemics. Here, we consider a model that we developed in association with the 2008-2009 Zimbabwe epidemic to explicitly estimate the basic reproductive numbers ( <0) for the disease, and make public health recommendations on the usefulness of cholera vaccines on a finer scale. In contrast to earliermodels applied to the Haitian epidemic, this model permits incorporation of recently recognized differences in transmission pathways for cholera: a ''fast,'' or ''human-to-human'' transmission pathway that takes advantage of the lower infectious dose of hyperinfectious V. cholerae in freshly passed stool, vs. a ''slow'' transmission pathway that involves movement between environmental reservoirs and human populations. We also explore the impact of variation in parameter estimates, including estimates for rates of asymptomatic carriage, environmentalcontamination, and infectious dose from environmental exposure. The Haitian Ministry of Health is currently considering implementation of a national vaccination campaign for cholera. Our results underscore the geo- graphic variability in < 0in the initial Haitian epidemic, and the corresponding variability in the needed vac- cination coverage for effective disease control. Results Table 2 provides estimates of the basic reproductive number ( <0), and partial reproductive numbers due to ''fast'' human-to-human transmission ( <h) and ''slow'' transmission through the environment ( <e); it also provides data on the corresponding minimum vaccination coverage needed for a cholera vaccine with an estimated 78%efficacy 7for the 10 departments and the country as a whole. The cumulative cholera cases were fit with math- ematical models for each department and for the whole country (Figure 1).

Artibonite department was the first to report cholera cases1and epidemiological studies have revealed that, the contamination of the Artibonite Riverand its tributaries ( i.e.sources of drinking and cooking water for villagers) triggered the epidemic 8. Thus our estimates support the notation that contamination of drinking water sources sparked theoutbreak in Artibonite. These results also show that departmentsneighboring Artibonite had slightly higher < 0values (1.37-1.73) compared to other departments (1.06-1.44), suggesting that it wasthe epidemic focal point. Our analysis showed that < hand<eesti- mates are determined by the time scales of the unfolding epidemic i.e. with fast growing epidemic curves giving a higher percentage of <h than <eand vice-versa. However the inference about the estimates of <0is likely more robust than the estimates of the individual trans- mission components (i.e. <evs.<h). Aggregated cholera data for Haiti compared with the department estimates will, on average, over-estimate the required country-wide vaccination coverage by about 20% (Table 2). Thus for effective disease control, surveillance and resource allocation there is a need to quantify the magnitude ofcholera outbreaks using data on a finer resolution. Analysis of dataon a finer grain would likely reveal additional heterogeneities intransmission, but the spatial scales at which it is appropriate to ag-gregate data for the purposes of planning control interventionsremain poorly understood. Since cholera vaccines have different efficacies 9-12, we also carried out sensitivity analysis to show possible scenarios that may arise from using different types of vaccines byconsidering an efficacy range of 50-100%. The results suggest that a vaccine with 50% efficacy may result in cholera control in most of the departments except for Artibonite, which would require a vaccine with at least 65% efficacy (Table 3).However most of the new-generation cholera vaccines have shownan efficacy more than to contain demic cholera ( i.e.depending on vaccination coverage). But, thereare still concerns that most of the studies on vaccine effectiveness were conducted in cholera endemic areas with some degree ofimmunity within the population, thus these study results may not hold for Haiti where the population was initially immunologically na\u00a8ve to the disease 13,14. Mapped <0values illustrate the differences in transmission across Haiti (Figure 2). Reproductive numbers were estimated separatelyfor Port-au-Prince (Table 2), and the part of Ouest that does not include Port-au-Prince, as in the data sets on the MSPP website 15.W e also estimated the reproductive number for the whole Ouest depart- ment, combining hospitalized cases from both Port-au-Prince and Ouest **, which was used for mapping (Figure 2). We performed sensitivity analysis using a deterministic version of our model to ascertain the robustness of our <0estimates. We carried out sensitivity analysis of k(the 50% infectious dose for envir- onmental exposure) and x(the rate of environmental contamination by cholera infected individuals). On the basis of studies conducted byour group in Lima and Bangladesh, peak environmental counts of ctx-positive V. cholerae from pristine areas have been found to range from 10 1to 102cfu/mL16,17; even in areas with heavy sewage contam- ination, peak environmental counts of ctx-positive V. cholerae were not observed to exceed 106cfu/ml16. The infectious dose for media- grown V. cholerae ingested by healthy North American volunteers ranges from 108to 1011cfu/mL; this drops to 104-108when the inoculum is given with bicarbonate or food18-20. In a series of studies conducted at the Center for Vaccine Development, University of Maryland, the ''standard'' V. cholerae inoculum in challenges employing health North American volunteers was 106, administered with bicarbonate20. In the context of these data, we carried out sensitivity analysis to explore the effects of kon<0estimates. Results using aggregated data for Haiti are shown in Figure 3, which is a plot of estimated <0and corresponding values of k.

However, these estimates will change byabout 13% in vibrio concentration ranging from 1.5 310 9to 1011cells/ml. In Figure 4 we present sensitivity analysis results on the effects of xon<0estimates by plotting estimated <0and corres- ponding values of x. This parameter may be influenced by a numberof socio-economic factors, including adequacy of sewage disposal, and consequently may vary within communities. The distribution of exposure doses would be, in all likelihood, highly skewed. In Figure 4,we note that a change in xfrom 1 to 100 only affects our estimates by approximately 3%. Thus, while there may be uncertainty around estimates for kandx, changes in these parameters do not substan- tially affect our results. The discontinuities in Figures 3 and 4 explain Figure 1 |Cholera model fitting for the cumulative cholera cases where the bold green lines represent the model fit and the blue circles mark the reported data for the cumulative number of cholera cases in the departments for 1000 runs.www.nature.com/ scientificreports SCIENTIFIC REPORTS | 3 : 997 | DOI: 10.1038/srep00997 3points where the curves stops being sensitive to changes in the para- meters and the fitting procedure abruptly switches to favor the <h component. In addition, we also explored the effects of other forms of unre- ported cholera infection such as asymptomatic colonization on <0by assuming that the current data represent a certain percentage ofreported cases in the clinical spectrum of cholera infection, and thenfitting the model to Haitian data. Here, we extend our basic choleramodel to incorporate a class of cholera asymptomatic cases as aproportion of total infections. We fit cholera reported data to theclass of symptomatic cases in the model based on the assumption that the available reported data only represent a percentage of the totalcholera cases. This model also assumes that asymptomatic patients,who shed approximately 10 3vibrios per gram of stool for only one day, do not significantly contribute to cholera infection21. Studies in the early 1970s suggested infection with cholera strains of classicalbiotype (responsible for the sixth cholera pandemic) resulted insevere cholera cases in only 11% of total infections; 59% of infectionswere asymptomatic and the remainder represented illness of mild tomoderate severity. Other studies during the same period showed that Table 3 |Sensitivity analysis of vaccination efficacies from 50%-100% and the corresponding percentage coverage's in the departments and the whole country.

However; recent studies have noted substantial increases in the per-centage of patients with severe dehydration 24, and the percentage of asymptomatic infected patients appears to be much smaller ( ,50%, in a recent study by Harris et al. in Bangladesh25), attributed to genetic changes in the organism26,27. Based on these studies we car- ried out sensitivity analysis to assess the effects of varying thepercentage composition of reported symptomatic cases in the range 15-100% on the basic reproductive number. The range of the per-centage composition of reported symptomatic cases (15-100%) con-sidered here is consistent with recent findings which suggest anincrease in the percentage of severe cases 24and a smaller percentage of asymptomatic carriage ( ,50%)25. The results in Figure 5 show that incorporating other forms of unreported cholera infection into themodel changed < 0estimate by less than 5%.

With the exception of the work byChunara et al. 28, these results are in the same general range as the estimates from other mathematical models of the initial Haitian epi- demic (Table 1), and are similar to those obtained for the 2008-2009Zimbabwe outbreak 6. However, in our model partial reproductive numbers were also highly heterogeneous suggesting that the patternsof transmission and transmission routes varied by department,and that some departments would be more amenable to vaccinationcompared with other kinds of interventions. The results in Table 2 suggest that on average, human-to-human transmission accounted for 68% of all the transmission, but both transmission pathwayscontributed to initiating and sustaining cholera outbreaks across the departments. These quantities of < 0.1 obtained for the depart- ments and the whole country (see Table 2) suggest that future epi- demics are highly likely, after population immunity has waned,unless effective control measures are put in place. These patterns address the concern that cholera may become endemic in Haiti because of a combination of a large estuarine system which may act as possible long-term ecological reservoirs for cholera, combined with continued transmission within human populations. In this set- ting, there would appear to be clear utility in mass vaccination with cholera vaccine with even moderate uptake, particularly in light ofthe significant herd protection afforded neighboring non-vaccinated individuals noted in prior studies 29. However, to achieve optimal Figure 5 |The relationship between <0and the percentage composition of reported symptomatic cholera cases reported using aggregated data for Haiti, parameter values from Table 4, and population size from Table 2. Figure 6 |Model flow diagram.www.nature.com/ scientificreports SCIENTIFIC REPORTS | 3 : 997 | DOI: 10.1038/srep00997 6protection of the population, vaccination would need to be combined with other measures that permanently improve water systems and/orotherwise decrease the risk of transmission from environmental sources. As alluded to above, the Haitian cholera epidemic has resulted in the development of several mathematical models (Table 1), driven, in part, by the close proximity of Haiti to the United States (with res- ultant interest in the outbreak), as well as recent developments inmodeling techniques. The prediction of the sequence and timing of regional cholera epidemics in Haiti using a spatial approach was reported by Tuite et al. 3. A similar spatial transmission model con- sidering hydrologic and human mobility drivers of pathogen dis- persal was proposed by Bertuzzo et al.4. Chao et al.5used an individual, agent-based, dynamic transmission model to understandthe dynamics of the of the cholera epidemic in Haiti. Not unexpect- edly, these and other models have given somewhat different results (Table 1). Nonetheless, the range of values for < 0has been fairly consistent; there is also clear convergence in the models related tothe importance of vaccination, combined, potentially, with efforts to minimize transmission from environmental sources. The Haiti situ- ation provides a unique opportunity to apply modeling results indevelopment and implementation of practical public health inter- ventions. As the history of cholera plays out in Haiti, it will be important to use the actual outcomes of these interventions to appro-priately parameterize and assess the value of this and other models and modeling approaches. Methods The cholera model compartmentalizes the human population (Figure 6), of density N, into susceptibles S, infected Iand recovered R(see on-line supplemental material included with reference6for a complete mathematical description of the model). The concentration of vibrios in contaminated water is denoted by B. As previouslydescribed in application of the model to the Zimbabwe cholera epidemic of 2008-09, susceptible individuals acquire cholera infection either by ingesting environmental vibrios from contaminated aquatic reservoirs (a ''slow'' transmission route requiringa higher infectious dose) or through close contact with infected humans associatedwith ingestion of ''hyperinfectious'' vibrios 30,31(a ''fast'' transmission route related to the observed decrease in infectious dose seen among V. cholerae within a matter of hours of passage in diarrheal stool) at daily per-capita rates le~beB kzBandlh~bhI respectively, with the subscripts eandhdenoting environment-to-human and human-to-human transmission routes. The constant kis a shape parameter that determines the human infectious dose: when B equals kthe probability of ingestion resulting in human disease is 0.5. beandbhare rates of exposure to vibrios from the contaminated environment and through human-to-human interaction respectively. Infected individuals recover from infection at a rate c. Cholera infected individuals contribute to V.cholerae in the aquatic environment at a daily rate xand vibrios have a net death rate din the environment. Readers interested in the model formulation, parameters and other properties should refer to6,23. The resulting model as a system of coupled stochastic differential equations is as are real constants and j(t)5(j1(t),j2(t)) is the Gaussian white noise process to model environmental stochasticity satisfying ,ji(t).50 where,. denotes ensemble average. It can also be shown that a solution of model system (Eqs. 1) is Markovian if and only if the external noises are white. We have assumed theStratonovich interpretation of stochastic differential equations (Eqs. 1), whichconserves the ordinary rule of calculus and in this case the stochastic differential equations can be considered as an ensemble of ordinary differential equations 32,33.A code in MATLAB H(The Mathworks, Inc., Version 7.10.0.499, was used to fit the stochastic model system (Eqs. 1) to data and estimate the basic reproductivenumber and standard error for a given number of iterations. The code uses a fourthorder Runge-Kutta numerical scheme for numerical integration and the built-inMATLAB Hleast-squares fitting routine lsqcurvefit. In each iteration: 1. Two white noise time series, j 1(t) and j2(t) were generated; 2. The fitting routine lsqcurvefit found the parameters that minimized the sum of squared errors, including initial conditions ( S0,I0,R0,B0) and parameters a1and a2that scale the variance of j1andj2; 3. The estimates were stored in a table. This was repeated 1000 times. The means and standard errors of these parameter estimates are reported in Table 2. We fit the cholera model system (Eqs.1) to cumulative hospitalized cholera cases to estimate the basic reproductive numbers and critical vaccination coverage levels forthe geospatially localized cholera outbreaks in Haiti by using daily data on numbers ofhospitalized cases published on the MSPP website 15. These data may well be under- estimates due to the weak health system in Haiti. However, despite quality issuessurrounding the data set, it presents the best currently available platform for quan-tifying the magnitude of the cholera outbreak in Haiti. The basic reproductive number ( < 0), is defined as a measure of the average number of secondary cases generated by a primary case. Understanding its magnitude andvariation can help to identify cholera ''hot spots'' and in designing targeted surveil-lance programs. The two transmission routes of cholera are quantitatively describedby partial reproductive numbers, < hand<ethat describe new cases that arise from either the fast human-to-human or the slower environment-to-human transmission routes, respectively. In the fitting, we estimate beandbhto match the reported hospitalized cases in each department and for the whole country with other parametervalues fixed as given in Table 4 and calculate the corresponding values of < e,<hand <0. For each department, we use the data points for the number of days that maximize the basic reproductive number estimate at the onset of an outbreak (i.e. maximizing be andbh), using data for the period from 30 0ctober 2010 to 25 December 2010. The data sets used for the estimation of <0were obtained by systematically testing dif- ferent subsets of data from the start of an outbreak. We also normalize our populationdata by 1000 thus computed estimates of b eandbhare per capita. The corresponding minimum vaccination coverage's (c) for a cholera vaccine with 78% efficacy7for the 10 departments and the whole country given are based on the formula in34, c\u00a71{<{1 0 1{1{r \u00f0\u00de 1{s \u00f0\u00de\u00f02\u00de where ris the fraction of the vaccinated population who are completely immunized andsis the proportional reduction of the susceptibility for those partially immunized. 1.
