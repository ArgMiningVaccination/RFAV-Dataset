Adequate vaccination coverage is essential to achieve polio eradication, but misconceptions about polio vaccines have hindered vaccination efforts. To address this issue, we conducted a mixed-methods study to explore knowledge and perceptions regarding polio disease and immunization in high-risk areas of Pakistan. We collected quantitative data from 3780, 1258, and 2100 households in Karachi, Bajaur, and Pishin, respectively, and supplemented this with qualitative data from focus group discussions and in-depth interviews. Our findings reveal a high level of awareness about polio and its immunization; however, misperceptions about the polio vaccine persist, leading to refusal for both polio vaccines and routine immunizations. Our study provides up-to-date data on knowledge and perceptions of polio and its immunization and identifies critical gaps. These findings can inform the development of future strategies and innovative approaches to improve the success of the polio program in Pakistan.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-07-05", "cleaned_text": "Exploring Knowledge and Perceptions of Polio Disease and Its Immunization in Polio High-Risk Areas of Pakistan [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines11071206](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines11071206) The GPEI was established in 1994 in Pakistan and has substantially reduced the country's polio burden [ [2](#B2-vaccines-11-01206)]. However, despite concerted national efforts, the transmission of wild poliovirus continues to occur, and Pakistan continues to be affected by wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) [ [3](#B3-vaccines-11-01206)]. The lowest number of cases reported was 8 in 2017, but a rise in polio cases was observed in the following years, with 12 cases in 2018, 147 cases in 2019, and 84 cases in 2020. In 2020, the polio surveillance system in Pakistan identified poliovirus circulation in 38 districts of Pakistan, including the high-risk areas of Karachi, Northern Sindh, Southern Punjab, Peshawar, and the Quetta block. In 2022 virus circulation is ongoing, and to date, Pakistan has 20 positive cases, all confined to the hard-to-reach Waziristan area [ [2](#B2-vaccines-11-01206)]. [4](#B4-vaccines-11-01206)]. In addition to the OPV given during the campaigns, four doses of the OPV are also offered at birth and the ages of 4, 10, and 14 weeks as a part of routine immunization in the National Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) [ [5](#B5-vaccines-11-01206)]. In 2015, the Government of Pakistan also included one dose of Injectable Polio Vaccine (IPV) to be given at 14 weeks in the national EPI to further boost immunity among children [ [6](#B6-vaccines-11-01206)]. To eradicate Polio from Pakistan, all children must receive a sufficient number of polio doses during the campaigns and routine immunizations [ [7](#B7-vaccines-11-01206)]. Failure to do so will result in continued poliovirus circulation in Pakistan [ [8](#B8-vaccines-11-01206)]. [9](#B9-vaccines-11-01206), [10](#B10-vaccines-11-01206)]. The literature suggests that misperceptions based on cultural and religious beliefs and customs are the critical barrier to polio vaccination [ [10](#B10-vaccines-11-01206), [11](#B11-vaccines-11-01206), [12](#B12-vaccines-11-01206)]. Misconceptions surrounding the oral polio vaccine, propagated by religious leaders, extremist groups, and organizations in Pakistan, have emerged as significant barriers to the uptake of the vaccine [ [12](#B12-vaccines-11-01206), [13](#B13-vaccines-11-01206), [14](#B14-vaccines-11-01206)]. Another study proposed that the pervasive use of social media has led to the growing prevalence of religious fatalistic beliefs coupled with the dissemination of misinformation, disinformation, and fake news, presenting a significant risk to the adoption of protective behaviors [ [15](#B15-vaccines-11-01206)]. Prevalent rumors in high-risk communities include claims that the OPV is anti-Islamic, contains impermissible haram ingredients, causes infertility, and that the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) is a foreign agenda [ [11](#B11-vaccines-11-01206), [12](#B12-vaccines-11-01206), [13](#B13-vaccines-11-01206), [14](#B14-vaccines-11-01206)]. [11](#B11-vaccines-11-01206)]. Therefore, we conducted a mixed-method study in high-risk areas for polio in Pakistan to identify the current knowledge and perceptions about polio and its vaccination. In addition, this study estimates the current coverage of routine immunization and uptake of the oral polio vaccine and compares the existing knowledge, perceptions, and vaccine coverage with previous findings [ [11](#B11-vaccines-11-01206)]. 2. Methodology [Figure 1](#vaccines-11-01206-f001)). [Table 1](#vaccines-11-01206-t001)). After choosing the UCs, we utilized the WHO 30X7 technique [ [16](#B16-vaccines-11-01206)] to achieve the sample size within each union council for the quantitative part of the study. This approach provided us with a sample size of 210 in each union council, which is a suitable sample to assess the coverage of vaccines and the knowledge of parents and care providers [ [17](#B17-vaccines-11-01206)]. The overall sample sizes for Karachi, Pishin, and Bajaur were 3780, 2100, and 1260, respectively. In order to determine the 30 areas and 7 households for our study, we relied on the micro plans utilized by the polio eradication program. These micro plans are comprehensive plans created for each union council outlining the specific areas where vaccinations are administered and identifying households with children under 5 years of age. From the provided lists, we randomly selected 30 areas and from each of the selected areas, 7 households were selected with children under 5 years of age for the interview. [Table 2](#vaccines-11-01206-t002)). The selection of participants for the IDIs and FGDs was performed through purposive convenience sampling. 3. Data Analysis 4. Results 4.1. Quantitative Component [Table 3](#vaccines-11-01206-t003)summarizes the demographic information from the target areas. The average household size was 9.1 people for Bajaur, 12.5 for Pishin, and 7.8 for Karachi. The highest proportion of illiterate people was found in Pishin (84.2%) and the lowest was in Karachi (44.1%). [Table 4](#vaccines-11-01206-t004)). [Table 5](#vaccines-11-01206-t005)shows that the knowledge about the oral polio vaccine (OPV) was reportedly high, from 97% to 99%, in all three study areas. Its effectiveness for polio prevention was understood, with 69% of respondents in Pishin, 89% in Karachi, and 94% in Bajaur perceiving it as a necessary preventive measure against polio. A substantial proportion of people reported contracting polio due to not receiving the OPV. There are still concerns regarding the OPV, which was perceived as being utterly safe by 77% of respondents in Karachi and 63% in Bajaur, but only by 42% of the people in Pishin. [Table 6](#vaccines-11-01206-t006)). 4.2. Comparison with a Previous Similar Survey Conducted in 2012 [Table 7](#vaccines-11-01206-t007)) from our survey with a comparable survey conducted in 2012 [ [11](#B11-vaccines-11-01206)]. The data revealed that respondents had a good understanding of polio, particularly in terms of its implications. However, their perceptions regarding the safety of the OPV were noticeably low. 4.3. Qualitative Component \"Grandmothers guide our daughters-in-laws about child-rearing and caring, counsel what to feed if the child has fever or pain, what type is food is good in hot and cold weather to keep the child healthy.\" \"Health of our children is not good, as most children don't get a vaccination, they don't get proper nutrition, and live in unhygienic conditions. Nowadays, the diet of mothers is also not good that's why children are weak.\" \"Polio workers give knowledge and guide us about health and vaccine, we are thankful to them that they visit our households repeatedly for the sake of community health.\" \"People believe that these vaccines are for family planning, cause infertility to decrease their generation.\" \"Only legs are not affected by polio disease but it may cause many other problems like weakness, low immunity, heart disease, indigestion, weakens of an arm or leg and it can also lead to death.\" \"My niece got affected by polio disease because her mother never gave her polio drops. When she took her to the doctor, he told them that she got infected by poliovirus. Now, she is 18 years old but disabled. After this incident, my sister gave polio drops to every child to prevent them from polio virus.\" \"Water testing from drainage was done to identify the polio virus in our area and it has been proven that this is one of the main reasons for spreading this disease. Unfortunately, no vaccine and medicine can save children, until and unless the environment can be cleaned.\" \"I have seen that there was one girl who was 18 months old, and she got polio attack and she became disabled. So, her family took her to the Syed family (the direct descendants of the Prophet Muhammad), and within 5 days she became normal. Another child was in the last stage, and they took the child to the Maulvi and then the child became normal.\" \"Mostly people refuse to give polio drops to their male child. When asked about the reason for refusal during the polio campaign, and said we have an only male child in our family and these drops cause impotence.\" 5. Discussion [18](#B18-vaccines-11-01206), [19](#B19-vaccines-11-01206)]. Some of the respondents wrongly perceived polio as treatable. The common perceptions about polio transmission were that it occurs due to living in unhygienic conditions, not vaccinating children, and migrants with unknown polio vaccine status. Quite unlike misperceptions about the role of clergy or mosques in polio vaccination, sources of information shared by respondents included doctors, grandmothers, community health workers (CHWs)/lady health workers (LHWs), television, radio, information, education and counselling (IEC) material, banners, and posters. [20](#B20-vaccines-11-01206)]. These perceptions by a few also influence other community decision-makers and are the most critical barrier to overcome moving forward [ [21](#B21-vaccines-11-01206), [22](#B22-vaccines-11-01206)]. The corollary to the strength of the current anti-vaccination movements worldwide could not be starker. [18](#B18-vaccines-11-01206), [23](#B23-vaccines-11-01206)]. Analysis revealed that these mobilization activities are very helpful as initially people were rigid and did not have any understanding of vaccination, and even used to refuse to open their doors, but a drastic change was observed after a rigorous and collective effort by all stakeholders. The involvement of CHWs/LHWs positively impacted the vaccine coverage rate [ [24](#B24-vaccines-11-01206)]. The steps of the CHWs and LHWs were highly admired as they were prominent in terms of communication and had good rapports with families through their day-to-day interactions with mothers. They also guided them in health and vaccine-related issues by addressing their concerns in a timely manner, which helped minimize their doubts and fears concerning vaccination. It was quoted that the number of zero doses has drastically declined. Studies suggest that developing a trusted relationship with parents is the key to influencing parental decision-making about polio and routine immunization [ [25](#B25-vaccines-11-01206)]. [18](#B18-vaccines-11-01206), [26](#B26-vaccines-11-01206), [27](#B27-vaccines-11-01206)]. Additionally, polio-prevalent areas should be targeted to alter the negative attitudes of those who refuse vaccination through identification and subsequent counseling by community leaders/influential members, CHWs/LHWs, and other civil society stakeholders. Improving the attitude of the community along with their knowledge of polio will aid in turning the dream of a polio-free world into a reality for all children. [2](#B2-vaccines-11-01206)]. Most of these families are impoverished, underserved, and lack basic needs. Additionally, in recent years, social media has also played an important role in rapidly spreading false rumors about the polio program [ [28](#B28-vaccines-11-01206)]. Furthermore, weakened essential immunization services, poor water and sanitation, and lack of maternal and child health care further compound the polio eradication challenge in Pakistan [ [29](#B29-vaccines-11-01206)]. To overcome these challenges an integrated approach is required in which all of these services should be given to communities holistically. A large population-based trial conducted in high-risk areas for polio in Pakistan provided a community mobilization strategy. It targeted community-based health and immunization camps during polio immunization campaigns, which resulted in an effective increase in vaccine coverage in campaigns and routine immunization [ [30](#B30-vaccines-11-01206)]. This model can be scaled up along along with integrated services to achieve maximum coverage for the OPV in high-risk areas.
