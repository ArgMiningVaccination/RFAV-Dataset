They are not energy-yielding nutrients but instead support the body in producing energy. Vitamin B12, or cobalamin, is specifically known for balancing energy levels. The active methylated form of vitamin B12, or methylcobalamin, is more easily absorbed into the body. This vitamin helps convert food into simple sugars - like glucose - that can then be utilized for energy production. Vitamin B12 also aids in red blood cell production, which assists in the delivery of oxygen throughout the body - a critical ingredient for breaking down glucose to produce energy. - Vitamin D Vitamin D supports a healthy immune system and stabilizes stress levels, which is why fatigue is one of the most common side effects of [low vitamin D levels](https://www.thesynergycompany.com/blog/vitamin-d-deficiency).

For women between the ages of 19 to 50 years, a much higher daily iron intake is required due to monthly menstrual blood loss, as compared to men or to women who have reached menopause.
