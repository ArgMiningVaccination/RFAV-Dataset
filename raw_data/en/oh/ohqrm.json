RESTART is a 5-week class which includes a 3-week built in sugar detox. It consists of a small, highly supportive group of 6-10 people online (on Zoom) and in person (when safe to meet in person). People are empowered in their self-care and learn long-term strategies to make good nutritional choices. A recipe book of simple, easy meals and snacks is included as well as a food journal to help make connections between what we eat and how we feel. There will a forum for discussion in between classes. This is truly a transformative journey! Here is a summary of what you be learning each week: Week 1 We prepare to be set up for success by planning & prepping, and getting our shopping lists in order. Week 2 We learn the basics of how digestion works and begin the sugar detox (aka the real food challenge). Week 3 We learn all about blood sugar regulation. Week 4 We learn about the facts of fats. Week 5 We celebrate our success and talk about reintroducing foods and moving forward. I have truly enjoyed Lauren Sugarman's RESTART class! I have had a complicated \"relationship\" to sugar my whole life, and this program has helped me discover, and more importantly, re-think that relationship. I have loved the camaraderie with classmates, learning more deeply about food and its various benefits and potential harms to our bodies, and trying new recipes!

The GI Microbial Assay Plus, also known as the GI-MAP, uses DNA analysis to assess the health benefits or disease risks from microorganisms that inhabit the body. It is currently the most accurate and sensitive stool test available today only requiring one stool sample. It tests for pathogens, parasites, yeast, as well as assessing the health of your microbiome, and your digestion. It looks at levels of normal bacterial flora, and whether there are critical strains that are missing or too low. It also evaluates intestinal health markers such as enzyme output, inflammation, and immune function. MRT TESTING A food sensitivity test. Food sensitivities can play a role in many common health conditions. The Mediator Release Test, also known as the MRT, tests for 170 different food and food chemicals. It is currently the only blood test available that tests cellular end-point reactions to foods, chemicals and other foreign substances, and quantifies the degree of inflammatory reaction. The technology used for the MRT delivers the most comprehensive picture of cellular reactivity. Functional Nutrition FAQ Yes, Lauren uses an array of supplements from reputable companies depending upon the particular issue. She recommends certain diets as well depending on the client's bioindividuality, and always has the client do a food journal before the first visit. Protocols typically last between 10-12 weeks and are followed with a retest of the stool sample only. Yes, Lauren always starts with GI healing first since that is always the first priority when it comes to healing. Often, other issues resolve just by addressing GI issues. If the other issues do not resolve, that is when we would explore other testing options. Yes, Lauren offers 4, 6 and 9 month packages. All of the nutritional consultation is done remotely through a HIPPA compliant platform. Depending on the type of package, the client typically has unlimited email access for any concerns that arise during our work together. Success Stories \"Lauren is amazing. She listens, asks good questions, and she is very, very gentle. I always look forward to her calming effect on my sometimes-stressed mind and body. I came to Lauren for several reasons. I had unexplained nausea, that even the doctors couldn't figure out. I also found it difficult to just stop and relax. I had gained weight. I had stress that I hadn't acknowledged. I felt like a new person after every treatment, and the feeling in my body lasted for many days. Lauren recommended a three-week gentle cleanse regimen, which got me on a better eating plan, and I felt great. I have been more relaxed and eating better. My nausea completely disappeared. And, I lost weight.\" Joanne Black, Business Owner, California \"I truly continue to love the benefits I am enjoying six months after I successfully completed the 21 day cleanse program! It has completely changed my relationship with food! I had been on a statin for years and not mindful of my diet. Lauren's thorough consultation, caring support (including the 2 wonderful acupuncture treatments), and the detox program kit were a life changer for me! I am no longer on the statin, I lost 15 pounds which I still maintain, and most importantly, I developed long-term healthier eating habits! Thank you so much Lauren!\" Mark Milberg, Senior Director Biotech Company, California "}
