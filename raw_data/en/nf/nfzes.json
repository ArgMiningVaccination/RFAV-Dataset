Road Map to the Eight Required CWCS Elements This appendix was provided to help the National Acceptance Advisory Team (NAAT)1 evaluate this document to determine whether Alaska's CWCS planning process met the eight congressionally required elements for a comprehensi ve wildlife conservation strategy. It lists the section, page, and appendix numbers in the CWCS that address each required element. Based on the NAAT's findings that all eight required elements were satisfactorily fulfilled, Alaska received formal approval of its CWCS from the Director of the USFWS in December 2005. Element 1: Information on the distribution and abundance of species of wildlife, including low and declining populations as the state deems appropriate, that are indi cative of the diversity and health of the state's wildlife: NAAT Guidance Section Page # Table Figure Page # Appendix Page #2 A. The Strategy indicates sources of information (e.g., literature, data bases, agencies, individuals) on wildlife abundance and distribution consulted during the planning process. IIC, E; V 9-14; 140-144 4, 8 In Appendix 4, see especially Boxes B & J B. The Strategy includes information about both abundance and distribution for species in all major groups to the extent that data are available. There are plans for acquiring information about species for which adequate abundance and/or distribution information is unavailable. IVB,VII, VIII 92-101, 148-151, 152-159 4 In Appendix 4, see especially Boxes B & G C. The Strategy identifies low and declining populations to the extent data are available. 1 (T&E); 4, 7 App. 1 (pgs 12-13, 15, 21, 22). In Appendix 4, see especially Box Bs D. All major groups of wildlife have been considered or an explanation is provided as to why they were not (e.g., including reference to implemented marine fisheries management plans). The State may indicate whether these groups are to be included in a future Strategy revision. I; IIC, D; VII 5; 9-11, 13; 148- 151 3, 4, 7 In Appendix 4, see especially Box B E. The Strategy describes the process used to select the species in greatest need of conservation. The quantity of information in the Strategy is determined by the State with input from its partners, based on what is available to the State. I, II 5, 9-13 1, 3, 4, 7 In Appendix 4, see especially Boxes B-E 1 Chaired by the USFWS Assistant Direct or for Migratory Birds and State Progr ams, the NAAT consisted of the six USFWS Assistant Regional Directors for Migratory Birds and State Programs and the five state presi dents of the nation's regional associations of fish and wildlife agencies. 2 Each appendix is paginated individually; \"box\" refers to the templates for each species or group. 206 Appendix 2, Page 2 Element 2: Descriptions of locations and relative condition of key habitats and community types essential to conservation of species identified in (1): NAAT Guidance Section Page # Table Figure Page # Appendix Page # A.

The Strategy identifies how conservation actions address identified threats to species of greatest conservation need and their habitats. IIC, V 12, 140-144 4 See especially Box Gs B. The Strategy describes conservation actions sufficiently to guide implementation of those actions through the development and execution of specific projects and programs. VII, VIII 148-151, 152-159 4 See especially Box Gs C. The Strategy links conservation actions to objectives and indicators that will facilitate monitoring and performance measurement of those conservation actions (see Element #5) IX 160-163 4 See especially Box Gs D. The Strategy describes conservation actions (where relevant to the state's species and habitats) that could be addressed by federal agencies or regional, national or international partners and shared with other states. VII 148-151 4 See especially Box Gs E. If available information is insufficient to describe needed conservation actions, the Strategy identifies research or survey needs for obtaining information VII 148-151 4 See especially Box Gs F. The Strategy identifies the relative priority of conservation actions. VII 148-151 208 Appendix 2, Page 4 Element 5 : Proposed plans for monitoring species identified in (1) and their habitats, for monitoring the effectiveness of the conservation actions proposed in (4), and for adapting these conservation actions to resp ond appropriately to new information or changing conditions: NAAT Guidance Section Page # Table Figure Page # Appendix Page # A. The Strategy describes plans for monitoring species identified in Element #1, and their habitats. VII, VIII, IX 148-151, 152- 159, 160-163 4 See especially Boxes G & H B. The Strategy describes how the outcomes of the conservation actions will be monitored.IX 160-163 Tables 36, 37 161, 162 4 See especially Boxes G & H C. If monitoring is not identified for a species or species group, the Strategy explains why it is not appropriate, necessary or possible. N/A 4 See especially Boxes G & H D. Monitoring is to be accomplished at one of several levels including individual species, guilds, or natural communities. VIII 152-159 4 See especially Boxes G & H E. The monitoring utilizes or builds on existing monitoring and survey systems or explains how informat ion will be obtained to determine the effectiveness of conservation actions. VIII, IX 152-159, 160- 163 4 F. The monitoring considers the appropriate geographic scale to evaluate the status of species or species groups and the effectiveness of conservation actions. VII, VIII, IX 148-151, 152- 159, 160-163 G. The Strategy is adaptive in that it allows for evaluating conservation actions and implementing new actions accordingly.

List of F eatured Species and Groups The Strategy highlights the conservation need s of a large number of species, species groups, and/or species assemblages, and the habitats that support them. For a subset of Alaska's species, the Strategy provides detailed natural history information and measurable conservation goals and strategi es. These species and groups, which we've termed \"featured species,\" are listed below. Species were selected based on criteria developed during the planning process. Fo r a more detailed explanation of how species were selected, refer to CWCS Section II. Experts worked on featured species by taxa group in order to develop the conservation action plans presented in Appendix 4. The taxa subgroupings were: amphibians and reptiles, marine fish, ma rine invertebrates, seabirds, marine mammals, terrestrial mammals, Cucumbers Spionid Polychaetes Benthic Ecosystems Sponges Cold Water Corals Black Corals Gorgonian Corals Stony Corals Sea Whips Sea Pens Sponges Shallow Rocky Reef Ecosystem Northern Abalone 211 Appendix 3, Page 2 Marine Fish Forage Fish Occurring in Inte rtidal/Shallow Subtidal Areas Reptiles Leatherback Seaturtle Sea Marine Mammals Cook Inlet Beluga Whale Ice-associated Marine Mammals Polar Bear Walrus Bearded Seal Ringed Seal Ribbon Seal Spotted Seal Large Whales Fin Whale Sperm Whale Sei Whale Blue Whale Gray Whale Bowhead Whale Humpback Whale Whale North Pacific Right Whale Northern Sea Otter 212Appendix 3, Page Flat Worms Seed Shrimp Mollusca Yukon Floater Western Pearl Shell Western Floater Freshwater Fish Pacific Lamprey Arctic Lamprey River Stickleback Ninespine Stickleback Amphibians Native Amphibians Western Toad Columbia Spotted Frog Wood Frog Northwestern Salamander Long-toed Salamander Rough-skinned Queen Charlotte Goshawk Raptor Bald Osprey Peregrine Falcon Rough-legged Hawk Red-tailed Hawk Northern Harrier Sharp-shinned Hawk Short-eared Owl Golden Eagle Black Merlin and Gyrfalcon Forest Owls Northern Pygmy-Owl Barred Owl Northern Saw-whet Owl Western Screech-Owl Northern Hawk Owl Boreal Owl Great Gray Owl Great-horned Owl Snowy Owl 214 Appendix 3, Page 5 Landbirds Landbirds with Long-term Population Declines o Rangewide Ptarmigan Song Gray-crowned Rosy Finch McKay's Bunting Smith's Longspur 215 Appendix 3, Page 6 Terrestrial Mammals Southcoastal Bats Little Brown Bat Long-legged Myotis Keen's Myotis Silver-haired Bat California Myotis Southeast Alaska Endemic Small Mammals Ermine Forest Deer Mouse Marten Revillagigedo Island Meadow Jumping Mouse Flying Squirrel Southern Red-backed Vole Dusky Shrew Sitka Tundra Vole Glacier Bay Water Shrew Long-tailed Vole Admiralty Island Beaver Admiralty Island Meadow Vole Glacier Bay Hoary Marmot Southwest Alaska/Bering In Squirrel Kenai Marten Alaska Marmot and Barro w Arctic Ground Squirrel Cryptically colored, the eelgrass shrimp is a key species in eelgrass communities. A. Baldwin 216 Appendix 4, Page i Appendix 4. Conservation Action Plans Introduction This appendix generally describes what is known about species and species groups featured in the CWCS. It establishes goals for their conservation and sets targets or milestones to be accomplished. The appendix in cludes conservation actions that experts believe will help overcome issues identifie d during the planning process. The appendix typically also includes an introduction to each taxonomic group. Length and content of these introductions varies. For more than 40 of the featured species, the Alaska Natural Heritage Program (AKNHP) prepared detailed information, including on distribution and abundance, concerns, level of protection, conservation status, and potential conserva tion and management actions (see http://aknhp.uaa.alaska.edu/zoology/zoology_adfg.htm ).

Achieving sustainability of resour ces, economies, coastal communities and the ecosystems in which these are all embedded requires conservation strategies that acknowledge the complex social and ecological interactions that drive marine ecosystem dynamics (Scheffer et al. 2001; Wa lker et al. 2002). The focus of this template is on the approach that will be used for conser vation planning, one that encompasses the ecological relationships among mu ltiple species and habitats.

Conser vation Ecology 6(1):article 14. 223 Appendix 4, Page 2 Nearshore Soft Benthic Ecosystems This ecosystem extends from the intertidal to the shallow subtidal (+ 6 m to -30 m) and includes eelgrass, mud, sand and gravel habita ts. We identified 2 sp ecies assemblages of concern: 1) intertidal and shallow subtidal bivalves and 2) eelgrass-associated invertebrates. An ecosystem-based approach to the conservation of these assemblages would acknowledge the complex food web intera ctions between structure forming plants (e.g., Zostera marina), stabilizing s (e.g., dungeness crabs stars), bottomfi sh that inhabit this \"nurse ry\" ecosystem (e.g., sand lance, sand sole, starry founder, juvenile salmonids), shorebirds (e.g., sandpipers, ducks and geese) that depend on secondary consumers (s hrimp, worms, small bivalves) as a primary source of food, and finally, marine mammals (e .g., harbor seals, sea otters and gray whales) that also forage in this ecosystem. Some ecosystem dynamics to consider: Freshwater and nutrient inputs from upstream watersheds influencing nearshore water and sediment chemistry (i.e ., hypoxia) and sediment grain size Oceanic nutrient inputs from offshore upw elling and marine derived nutrients from returning salmonid species Water filtration rates Sedimentation vs. erosion rates Bacterial activity and detrital cycling Benthic Common name : eelgrass-associated invertebrates Scientific names: a variety of invertebrate 1985) beds are among the most productive ecos ystems on the planet. The invertebrates associated wi th eelgrass play a key role in transferring energy from the eelgrass to higher trophic levels (Nelso n and Waaland 1997; J ohnson et al. 2003). 224 Appendix 4, Page 3 B. Distribution and abundance Range : (McRoy 1966; McRoy and Helfferich 1977) Global range comments : Zostera marina is discontinuous from the Sea of Okhotsk and Japan, the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean Sea, the North Pacific as far south as Agiopampo Lagoon, Mexico State range comments : North to Port Clarence, west to Atka Island, the Gulf of Alaska including the Southeast Panhandle Abundance : Global abundance comments : Unknown State abundance comments : Unknown Trends : Global trends : Generally declining State trends : Unknown C. Problems, issues, or concerns for species group Eelgrass invertebrates act as a crucial link in transferring energy from eelgrass production to higher trophic levels (Shirley 2003) The distribution of eelgrass across the state is poorly known and the associated invertebrate assemblages are also poorly documented Eelgrass is vulnerable to destruction from turbid water and fishing gear Pesticides used in mariculture can directly affect eelgrass-asso ciated invertebrates (Thayer et al. 1975; Griffin 1997) Many of the associated invertebrates ar e dependent upon the eelgrass environment and are severely impacted by the disappearance of eelgrass beds (Stauffer 1937). Disease (Rasmussen 1977; Levinton 1982) D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Unknown. An evaluation of location and c ondition of this habitat is needed. E. Concerns associated with key habitats Light availability is an important fact or limiting eelgrass growth; the amount of light reaching eelgrass can be influenced by human activities, such as sediment loads caused by logging and st reamside activities. Eutrophication is regarded as a major factor of eelgrass bed declines because it stimulates the overgrowth of epi phytic algae (Huges et al. 2004). High nutrient input from fertilizers, sewage , and fish waste can result in excessive epiphyte growth on eelgrass blades that can also deprive eelgrass of light. Pesticides used to control invertebrates in mariculture operations may also kill the invertebrates in nearby eelgrass beds (Thayer et al. 1975; Griffin 1997). Coastal development has been the primary cause of widespread seagrass loss (Short and Wyllie-Echeverria 1996). 225 Appendix 4, Page 4 Physical disturbance via commercial fish ing gear (Stephan et al. 2000; National Research Council 2002; Trush and Dayt on 2002) has been identified as a significant source of seagra ss habitat destruction. Tr awling, dredging and raking for bay scallops (Fonseca et al. 1984), mussels (Neckles et al. 2005), and hard clams (Peterson et al. 1983) have been found to damage eelgrass beds (Johnson 2002). Other activities such as dredging (Thayer et al. 1984), and associated construction of boat docks and harbors (Burdick and S hort 1999) significan tly impact eelgrass habitats. On-bottom shellfish aquaculture in close proximity to eelgrass beds can lead to habitat destruction as farmers access th eir beds. Geoduck mariculture may also affect eelgrass beds. F. Goal: Conserve and manage eelgrass-associat ed invertebrate populations throughout their natural range to ensure su stainable use of these resources. G. Conservation objectives and actions Objective : Sustain species diversity , population density and si ze structure of eelgrass- associated invertebrate populati ons within historic levels throughout the natu ral range of eelgrass beds. Target: Identify and then sustain a diversity of species, and density and size structure of eelgrass-associated invertebrate assemblages that is similar to historical conditions. Measure: Species diversity and populati on density and size structure. Issue 1 : The distribution and populati on status of eelgrass beds and associated fauna is unknown in most parts of the state. Conservation actions: a) Identify remote sensing technologies, including advanced satellite imagery that may allow for large-scale mapping and monitoring of eelgrass beds statewide. b) Train local community groups to monitor species. Issue 2: There is a lack of information on speci es diversity associated with eelgrass habitats. Conservation action: Select 2-3 representative eelgra ss beds from across the state for intensive monitoring of the population stat us of the bed and species diversity of associated fauna assemblages. Beds woul d be selected based on the location of previous studies, such as Izembek Lagoon, Sitka Sound, and Kachemak Bay. Issue 3: Future increased mariculture in the stat e may have a negative effect on eelgrass- associated invertebrates. 226 Appendix 4, Page 5 Conservation actions: a) Locations selected for mariculture site s should continue to avoid areas of eelgrass. b) Monitor pesticides used in mariculture areas to determine their persistence and potential for impacts to the surrounding environment. H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats State and federal agencies, the universit y, industry, Native entities and NGOs should coordinate to establish a monitoring plan within the next 2 years that would begin annual monitoring with evalua tion at 5-year intervals. I. Recommended time frame for reviewing species status and trends Evaluate the strategy after 3 year s and then 5 years after that. J. Bibliography Burdick, D.M. and F.T. Short. 1999.

Species group description Common name : Commercially and recreationally harvested clams found in the sa me habitat include the Pacific little neck clam, Protothaca an important group of inve rtebrates as they are abundant in soft sediment areas and are prey for many other higher trophic level invertebrates, birds, fishes, and mammals (Fukuyama and Oliv er 1985; Bodkin et al. 2002; Dean et al. 2002). The loss of these animals may aff ect populations of many other species, including some commercially impor tant and subsistence species. B. Distribution and abundance Range : Global range comments : State range comments : Present throughout most stat e waters intertidally and subtidally Abundance : Global abundance comments : Probably locally abundant in areas not affected by pollution, intense fishing pressure, or sea otter predation State abundance comments : Probably locally abundant in areas not affected by pollution, intense fishing pressure, or sea otter predation Trends : Global trends : Unknown State trends : Unknown C. Problems, issues, or concerns for species group In general, lack of data within this group is a problem; better quantitative information on distribution and abundance is needed Lack of reproductive information; there is some reproductive information for a few species available in the literature This is an important group of animal s since they are prey for many other invertebrates, birds, fishes, and mammals; the loss of these animals may affect populations of many other species, incl uding some commercially important and subsistence species Unknown impact of contaminants or of diseases Effect of climate change through water temperature effects on clams and their prey unknown 229 Appendix 4, Page 8 D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Intertidal and subtidal soft sediment areas. Key areas include upper Cook Inlet, Copper River Delta and other large tidal wetlands for Macoma spp., which are a key prey species for wintering or migrating shorebirds (Bob Gill, USGS, personal communication). Other key areas for clams in clude the Aleutian Islands, Bristol Bay, Prince William Sound, and for Serripes spp., areas of the Chukchi Sea. An evaluation of location and condition of key habitats is needed\u2014currently unknown. E. Concerns associated with key habitats One potential threat is loss of intertidal habitat from commercial and residential development Another potential concern is pollution F. Goal: Conserve and manage clam populations th roughout their natural range to ensure sustainable use of these resources. G. Conservation objectives and actions State conservation and management objectives and actions : Objective : Develop targets for and sustain spec ies diversity, populati on density and size structure throughout its distribution. Target: Identify and then sustain a diversity of species, and density and size structure of those species that are refl ective of productive populations. Measure: Species diversity and populati on density and size structure. Issue 1 : Unknown spatial and temporal variab ility and extent of distribution. Conservation action: Assess spatial variability of habitat and populations. Issue 2: Trawling or other fishing gear impacts. Conservation actions : a) In collaboration with federal agencies and coastal communities, set aside areas to protect this benthic habitat from on-bottom fishing impacts. b) Promote development of innovative tec hnologies and alternative fishing gears and methods to minimize destruc tive effects of fishing gear. Issue 3: Lack of information on life history (growth and longevity). Conservation action: Identify and apply methods to age and measure growth rates. May apply methods used on other clam species for this group of clams. 230 Appendix 4, Page 9 Issue 4 : Trophic dynamics are unknown and ma y affect growth and survival. Conservation action: Quantify and identify inte raction strength with other components of ecosystem of other asso ciated species (predator and prey). H. Plan and time frames for moni toring species and their habitats State and federal agencies, universities, Na tive entities and NGOs should coordinate to establish a monitoring plan w ithin the next 2 years that would begin annual monitoring with evaluation at 5-year intervals. I. Recommended time frame for reviewing species status and trends Evaluate the strategy after 3 year s and then 5 years after that. J. Bibliography Bodkin, J.L., B.E. Ballachey, T.A. Dean, C.E.

Our featured species assemblage of deep sea corals, tunicates and sponges occur on both soft and hard substrates. As bioge nic habitat, this species assemblage offers structure, an important ecosystem service, to a wide variety of juvenile bottomfish, shrimp, and crab species, many of which are commercially important in Alaska. Turnover rates of primary production and the dispersa l of phytoplankton, governed by regional and local oceanic currents, have obvious rami fications given that phytoplankton is the primary food source for this filter feeding assemblage. Other key trophic interactions pertinent to this ecosystem include those be tween primary and secondary producers in the pelagic ecosystem above. Reciprocal relati onships among benthic epifauna (e.g., crab, shrimp, scallops), polychaetes, bivalves) and demersal fish (e.g., sablefish, lingcod, Pacific cod, black rockfi sh, halibut) are also german e. Commercially harvested invertebrates in this ecosystem include the weathervane scallop Patinopecten caurinus , king crab, Dungeness crab, Tanner crab, snow crab and shrimp. Some ecosystem dynamics to consider: Spatiotemporal dynamics between nutrient upwelling, phytoplankton and zooplankton production oceanographic regimes .e., Pacific Decadal Oscillation) Benthic pelagic coupling and microbial decomposition Role of biogenic habitat in fish and invertebrate population dynamics 232 Appendix 4, Page 11 Corals, Tunicates, and Sponges A. Species group description Common names : cold water corals, black coral, gorgonian corals, stony corals, sea whips, sea pens, and sponges. A high divers ity of species make up this assemblage, many of which are currently undescribed. Scientific names Range : Global range comments : Temperate benthic habitats State range comments : The regional extent of this species assemblage is unknown; however, in Alaska they have been do cumented in the Aleutian Islands (e.g., Andreanof Islands) (Heifetz 2002), Bering Sea, Gulf of Alaska and Southeast Alaska (Heifetz et al. 2003) and other areas (see Etnoyer and Morgan 2003). Abundance : Global abundance comments : Unknown State abundance comments : Percent cover of corals ranged from 5% on low relief pebble substrate to 100% on high relief bedrock at depths of 150-350 m (Heifetz 2002). Other species are comm on on soft bottom substrate, and populations may be patchy, making it difficult to assess impacts (Heifetz et al. 2003). Trends : Global trends : Although quantitative assessment ha s not been done, assemblages of corals and sponges are likely to have become increasingly impacted since the onset of commercial benthic trawling. State trends : same as above C. Problems, issues, or concerns for species group Known concerns and threats High potential for localized depletion due to mobile fishing gear impacts on the seafloor (e.g., trawling, longlining, pot fi sheries). The species assemblage are often slow-growing a nd very long-lived. Consequently, population recovery after impact is likely to be very slow. These organisms create biogenic habitat stru cture that has been documented to be very important habitat for variety of ot her organisms (e.g., flatfish, rockfish, cod, etc.). Their absence can reduce the surv ival rates and slow the recovery of commercially harvested species (Lin dholm, Walters and Kitchell 2001). Many corals and sponges are a specific food source for rare nudibranchs (e.g. Tochuina tetraquetra ) that feed on only one or several speci es of corals or sponges. Loss of the coral or sponge species would be detrimental to these nudibranchs. 233 Appendix 4, Page 12 A lack of data exists on the range ex tent of corals and sponges and their associated species. Population dynamics are unknown. Potential or suspected threats Climate change and how it alters oceanic temperature, salinity and circulation patterns (i.e., alteration of potential food sources and larval recruitment) Impact of disease is unknown Lack of information on the effects of natural disturbances Offshore dredging impacts D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas These corals and sponges are found in bent hic habitat on both soft and hard rock substrates. In areas impacted by fishing gear (heavily trawled areas) these habitats can be very degraded; however, in undisturbed areas, these habitats are often in very good condition. E. Concerns associated with key habitats Habitat alteration due to trawli ng, longlining and pot fisheries Lack of information on the effects of natural disturbances F. Goal: Conserve and manage assemblages of corals and sponges throughout their natural range to ensure sustainable use of these resources. G. Conservation objectives and actions Objective A : Sustain species diversity, population density, and size structure throughout its natural range within historic levels. Target: Identify and then sustain a diversity of species, and density and size structure of those species in known areas of population density that is similar to historical conditions. Measure: Species diversity, population density and size structure of assemblages in known areas of population densit y across their natural range. Target: Distribution of species is greater th an 90% of the historical distribution within state waters (experts in this gr oup recommend that it go beyond state waters). Measure: Percentage of known historical distribution. Objective B : Research the ecological role of corals and sponges in providing sufficient structural habitat for associated species (commercially important bottomfish species have higher survival rates in areas with complex bottom topography [Lindholm 2001]). Target: Identify or develop a species associa tion index, a measure of the utility of sponges and corals as habitat by key species. Measure: Species association index. Issues and conservation actions below apply to one or both objectives. 234 Appendix 4, Page 13 Issue 1: Habitat alteration and localized declines of corals due to trawling and or other mobile fishing gear impacts. In Alaska, anthropogeni cally induced disturbance to these benthic epifauna is most evident in heavily fished areas (Heifetz 2002; Heifetz et al. 2003). Conservation actions : a) In collaboration with federal agencies and coastal communities, set aside areas to protect this benthic habitat from on-bottom fishing impacts. b) Support an international agreement betw een Canada, the United States and Russia to establish an international offshore protected area. c) Promote development of innovative tec hnologies and alternative fishing gears and methods to minimize destruc tive effects of fishing gear. Issue 2: Lack of information on the taxonomy of corals and sponges. Conservation actions: a) Inventory and collaborate with gove rnment agencies, such as NOAA, universities, and local no ngovernmental organizations. b) Train observers and commercial fisher men in species identification and collection of unknown species for taxono mic identification (e.g., molecular methods). Issue 3 : Unknown spatial and temporal variability and extent of distribution of coral species. Conservation actions: a) Collect local ecological knowledge fr om trawl fishermen on the magnitude and extent of bycatch. b) Assess spatial variability and dist ribution of habitat and populations. Issue 4: Lack of information on life history (reproduction, growt h, and longevity) Conservation action: Identify and apply methods to age and measure growth rates in corals and sponges. H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats Current efforts to designate Habitat Area of Particular Concern (HAPC) for living substrates, such as corals and spong es, through the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act s hould be coordinated among management agencies and completed. Collaboration with fe deral agencies, universities, local coastal communities, and local NGOs is essential to effective monitoring of the resource. I.

Low marshes may be inundated by each high ti de, whereas high marshes are covered by seawater only a few times during the growing season. In this ecosystem we identified a very broad species assemblage: salt marsh-asso ciated invertebrates. The extensiveness of this species group reflects the paucity of info rmation on it yet our a ppreciation that it is a critical source of food to an incredibly wide variety of marine a nd terrestrial species. Migratory shorebirds use this ecosystem extensively, as do numerous land-based mammals, including bears, beav ers, muskrats, river otters , raccoons and deer. Burrowing filter feeders that inhabit this ecosystem in clude many species of clams, cockles, and polychaete worms. Epifauna include gastropods, crabs, and oysters. Larval and juvenile stages of many fish and invertebrate species thrive in this protected system yet spend much of their adult life elsewhere. Conseque ntly, these ontogenetic shifts in habitat associations suggest that th ere are strong ecological connect ions to the other marine ecosystems identified in this report. Furthe rmore, because this system represents a transition zone between land and sea, the eco logical connections among species templates produced by the marine, terrestrial, and freshw ater expert groups ar e likely very high for this ecosystem. Some ecosystem dynamics to consider: Ontogenetic shifts in habitat associations Decomposition, detritus cyc ling, bacterial production Salt excretion and water storage Absorption of freshwater runoff Siltation rates vs. erosion rates Filtration and degradation of nitrogenous and phosphorous waste Land-based nutrient subsidies Salt Marsh-Associated Invertebrates A. Species group description Common name : salt marsh-associated invertebrates Scientific names: examples of salt marsh-associat ed invertebrates such ( pacifica Littorina sitkana ). Selection criteria: Salt productive systems (Mitsch and Gosselink 1993; Begon et al. 1996). The invertebrates associated with salt marshes play a key role in transferring energy from mars hes to higher trophic levels (Graca et al. 2000; Peterson and Howarth 1987). 237 Appendix 4, Page 16 B. Distribution and abundance (species assemblage unknown; therefore, range, abundance, trends unknown) Range : Global range comments : State range comments : Abundance : Global abundance comments : State abundance comments : Trends : Global trends : Generally declining State trends : Unknown C. Problems, issues, or concerns for species group In general, lack of data within this habita t is a major problem. An inventory of salt marsh-associated species, along with quant itative information on distribution and abundance, is needed. This is a very important habitat for variety of other plants and animals. The loss of this habitat with its asso ciated organisms may affect populations of many other species, including some commercially harvested species. D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Unknown; an evaluation of location and c ondition of this habitat is needed. E. Concerns associated with key habitats A key threat is loss of this habita t through commercial and residential development Loss from filling Pollution threats Alteration of habitat due to trawling in subtidal areas is a potentially important issue F. Goal: Conserve and manage salt marsh species assemblages throughout their natural range to ensure sustainabl e use of these resources. G. Conservation objective and actions Objective : Develop targets for, and sustain spec ies diversity, population density and size structure of, salt marsh-associated invert ebrates throughout the natural range of salt marshes in Alaska state waters. Target: Identify species and then attain the di versity of species, and density and size structure of those species, that is reflectiv e of productive populati ons of invertebrates associated with salt marsh habitats. Measure: Species identification, diversity, population density and size structure of salt marsh-associated invertebrate assemblages. 238 Appendix 4, Page 17 Issue 1 : Unknown spatial and temporal variab ility and extent of distribution. Conservation action: Assess spatial variability of salt marsh habitat and associated invertebrate populations. Issue 2: There is a lack of information on the spec ies that are associated with salt marsh habitats. Conservation actions: a) Inventory species. b) Train observers in species identificati on and collection of unknown species for taxonomic identification (including using molecular methods). H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats State and federal agencies, universities, Na tive entities, and NGOs should coordinate to establish a monitoring plan within the next 2 years that would begin biannual monitoring with evaluation at 5-year intervals.

Limnology 4, Page 18 Pelagic Ecosystems The pelagic ecosystem encompasses the wa ter column beyond -30 m over both hard and soft substrates. We identified zooplankton species (euphausiids, copepods, jellyfish, ctenophores, invertebrate fish larvae) as a primary inverteb rate species assemblage of concern. Reciprocal relationships among phyt oplankton, zooplankton, pelagic forage fish (e.g., herring), upper level fish predators (e .g., pollock), seabirds (e.g., shearwaters, albatross species, storm-petr els) and marine mammals (baleen and toothed whales) encompass some of the key trophic interactions of this system. Ecosystem dynamics to consider: Spatiotemporal dynamics between nutrient upwelling, phytoplankton and zooplankton production oceanographic regimes .e. pacific decadal oscillation) Benthic pelagic coupling and microbial decomposition Zooplankton A. description Common name : zooplankton, jellyfis h, ctenophores, larvae are an esse ntial link in the food chain and provide food for many seabirds, fishes, and marine mammals.

Problems, issues, or concerns for species group Great importance as food for invertebrates, fishes, seabirds, and marine mammals Dramatic seasonal, interannual and d ecadal-scale variability documented Importance of specific species unknown Lack of data on distribution and abunda nce, with the ex ception of studies conducted by UAF, Institute of Marine Science on some of the dominant copepods Potential and/or suspected threats Pollution from oil spills, oil and gas platforms, sewage outfall, forestry and mining runoff, anthropogenic and natural heavy metals Contamination from pollution sources (o il spills, oil platform discharge) Pesticide introduction from forestry, ag riculture, and mari culture activities Fish harvesting may alter trophic cascad es and result in dramatic changes in plankton communities Climate change; changes in ocean te mperature may affect distribution, abundance, and community composition D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Unknown; an evaluation of location and condition is needed. E. Concerns associated with key habitats Pollution from oil spills, sewage di scharge, mining and forestry runoff Fish harvest may alte r community composition F. Goal: Maintain the ecological function of zooplankton populations throughout their natural range to ensure sustainable use of these resources. G. Conservation objectives and actions Objective : Sustain species diversity, population density and size st ructure within historic levels. Target: Identify and then sustain a diversity of species, and density and size structure of those species that is sim ilar to historical conditions. Measure: Species diversity and populati on density and size structure. Issue 1: There is a fundamental lack of info rmation on importance of zooplankton in diets of seabirds, fishes, and marine mammals. Conservation action: Compile existing information on role of zooplankton in diets of seabirds, fishes, and marine mammals. A ssess temporal and spatial variation in the role of individual zoop lankton species as diet. Issue 2: Seasonal, interannual, and decadal-scale changes in zooplankton can impact the abundance of other species. 241 Appendix 4, Page 20 Conservation action: Develop a long-term monitoring program in various locations throughout the state. The California Coope rative Oceanic Fisheries Investigation (CalCOFI) program is one such model. Issue 3: Increases in mariculture in the state coul d potentially have a negative effect on zooplankton diversity and abundanc e through the use of pesticides. Conservation action: Monitor the use of pesticides in mariculture operations to determine their persisten ce and unintended impacts on the surrounding environment and zooplankton. H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats Management agencies, university research ers, local coastal communities, and local NGOs will need to coordinate to ensure th at a monitoring program is developed and deployed.

An ecosy stem-based approach to the conservation of nearshore rocky reef ecosystems would in clude conservation actions that address the threats to food web dynamics among reef fish predators (greenlings, rockfish, lingcod, cabezon), marine small cryptic reef fish (e.g., sculpins, war bonnets, pricklebacks, and gunnels), scavengers (red rock crabs), feeders and Mew gulls, Bald Eagles, Nort hwestern Crows, Common Ravens) and mammals that forage in this system (Ameri can mink, sea otters, river otters, American martens, black bears, harbor seals) can have direct and indirect effects on the species mentioned above, some of these interactions being more critical to system dynamics than others. While stressing the importance of consider ing the complex associations among algal and animal rocky reef food web dynamics, we ha ve identified the northern abalone, gumboot chiton and black leather chiton as 3 featured species of concern re presentative of this ecosystem. These specific species were identified because of known demographic limitations in the case of the northern abalone and localized declines in the case of the two chitons. Some ecosystem dynamics to consider: Top-down effects of keystone predators Kelp production and its contribution to s econdary consumers, both directly via invertebrate grazers and indirectly via filter feeders consumption of detritus Terrestrial subsidies via freshwater runoff Marine subsidies via upwellings, seabird colonies, sea lion and seal rookeries Interaction between upwellings, regional and local oceanographic currents, and larval dispersal and delivery 244 Appendix 4, Page 23 Benthic Grazers Katharina tunicata and Cryptochiton stelleri A. Species group description Common name : black Katy chiton, black leather ch iton, This competitive dominant benthi c grazer is known to govern the community dynamics and productivity of temperate rocky intertidal ecosystems (Detheir and Duggins 1984; Paine 1992, 2002). K. tunicata remains an important traditional subsistence food source for coastal Native Alaskans (Stanek et al. 1982; Fall and Utermohle 1999; Chugachmiut 2000) and is a prey item for sea otters and various seabirds (O'Clair and O'Clair 1998 ). As a result, there have been noticeable declines in the density and size structure of this chiton in some areas. Lastly, K. tunicata is representative of a broad arra y of other rocky intertidal be nthic species located on surf- swept rocky shores. Common name : gumboot chiton, giant Pacific chiton, Chinese slipper, lady Alutiiq Scientific name: Cryptochiton stelleri Selection criteria: Although primarily found in the subtidal, individuals found in the low intertidal are a subsistence food item fo r coastal Alaska Natives. Recruitment rates of C. stelleri are low, making this species vulnerable to overharvest (O'Clair and O'Clair 1998). Indeed, there have been no ticeable declines in the density and size structure of C. stelleri in some areas. B.

Problems, issues, or concerns for species group Known concerns and threats Localized depletion due to subsistence harvest Localized depletion due to predation by s ea otters, sea stars and other subtidal predators Lack of demographic data Recruitment limitation (especially in Cryptochiton ) makes these chitons more susceptible to overharvest Potential and/or suspected threats Pollution from oil spills, oil and gas platforms, sewage outfall, forestry and mining runoff, anthropogenic and natural heavy metals Contamination from pollution sources (o il spills, oil platform discharge) Disease - unknown impact Climate change; changes in ocean temper ature may effect chitons directly by altering their spawning period and length (H immelman 1978) and/or indirectly by affecting the production of their algal food sources and/or local current patterns which influence their metapopulation structure D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Both chiton species live on surf-swept roc ky shores, in low intertidal and shallow subtidal rocky reef habitats. Cryptochiton is generally found subtidally to 20 m on both rocky and muddy substrate (O'Clair and O'Clair 1998). Both chitons are more commonly found on exposed outer coasts. Generally, the condition of the habitats in which these chitons are found is very good, although shoreline development and pollution from oil spills, sewage discharge and forestry and mining runoff can degrade such habitats. 246 Appendix 4, Page 25 E. Concerns associated with key habitats Shoreline development Localized trampling Pollution from oil spills, sewage di scharge, mining and forestry runoff F. Goal: Conserve and manage chiton metapopulati ons throughout their natural range to ensure sustainable use of these resources. G. Conservation objectives and actions Objective A : (Katharina tunicata) Sustain population density and size structure throughout its distributio n at target levels. Target: 20-30 reproductive chitons per square meter within its microhabitats (reproductive individuals are 35 mm and greater [Strathman 1987]). Measure: Density of chitons in local population. Target: Size structure distribut ion: maximum 130 mm - mininum 5mm, average 50 cm. Measure : Size structure of chit ons in local population. Target: Sustain greater than 80% of known hi storical populations throughout natural range. Measure: Percentage of known historic al local populations sustained. Objective B : (Cryptochiton stelleri) Sustain population dens ity and size structure throughout its distribution. Target: Identify and then sustain typical popu lation density and size structure. Measure: Density and size structure of chitons in local population. Target: Sustain greater than 80% of known hi storical populations throughout natural range. Measure: Percentage of known historic al local populations sustained. Issues and conservation actions for both Katharina tunicata and Cryptochiton stelleri appear below. Issue 1 : Because they are broadcast spawners, both Katharina and Cryptochiton require a minimum density for successful fertilizat ion and reproduction. Consequently, these chitons are vulnerable to depensatory (Allee) effects. Furthe rmore, low densities of these grazers alter local a ssemblages including gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) producing crustose coralline algae implicated with successful recruitment (Strathman 1987). Therefore, low densities of this species may indi rectly impede local recruitment. Localized depletion due to harves t and interactions with other predators such as sea otters and seabirds has al ready been documented (Salomon 2003). 247 Appendix 4, Page 26 Conservation actions: a) In collaboration with coastal communiti es, experiment with harvest policies (harvest and no harvest zones, season al harvest restrict ions, minimum size limits, etc.) to estimate sustainable p opulation sizes and population recovery rates for local habitats. Quantify interac tion strength with other components of ecosystem. b) In collaboration with coastal communiti es, establish areas where harvest of chitons is not allowed interspersed with areas where chiton harvest is allowed in order to maintain optimum densit y of reproductive individuals embedded within a functional ecosystem. Issue 2 : Intertidal and subtidal habitat degradation along with direct contamination can occur due to pollution from various sources. Wate rshed discharges, such as sewage (point and nonpoint sources), forestry, mining and agricultural runoff, may degrade chiton habitat. Conservation actions : a) Promote proper regulation of discharge from offshore oil and gas platforms. b) Promote proper treatment of sewage to reduce nitrogen input levels and regulation of sewage flow rates to reduce particulates and turbidity levels that may be discharged during storm events. c) Promote regulations and policies that en sure sewage settling fields/ponds in rural areas are located far enough away from streams to allow for adequate filtration to occur. d) Document and promote regulations th at limit elevated nutrient levels originating from the fish waste disc harged by canneries and hatcheries. e) Promote regulations that curtail or el iminate the commercial use of antifouling paint that contains tri-butyl tin. f) Promote sustainable forestry and mining practices that re duce high turbidity and sediment flows. g) Discourage the use of fertilizers and pe sticides in reforestation and coastal agricultural and mariculture activities. Issue 3: There is limited education and community involvement in research. Conservation action: Community-based research s hould be prioritized for funding. Local communities can be trained to m onitor chiton densities to ensure the sustainability of chiton populat ions and encourage local stewardship of the resource. Issues 4: Growth rates, survival rates, and disp ersal distances of both adults and larvae are unknown. Conservation actions: a) Conduct tagging studies on both adults and larvae; assess growth rate and recruitment patterns of Katharina and Cryptochiton. 248 Appendix 4, Page 27 b) Consider genetic studies a nd local current pattern research to help determine metapopulation dynamics. c) Assess reproductive patterns relative to food resources and av ailability of food resources. Issues 5: There is a high degree of spatial and temporal variability and an unknown extent of suitable habitat in Alaska. Conservation action: Assess spatial variability of rocky reef habitat in Alaska. Issue 6: Population trends are unknown in Alaska. Conservation action: Collect local and trad itional ecological know ledge to develop a time series of historical p opulation dynamics. Archeological data from middens may also indicate how densities and sizes may have changes through time (Simenstad et al. 1978). Issue 7: Trophic dynamics are unknown and may affect the growth and survival of these chitons. For example, predation on the gumboot chiton by predators the distribution and abundance of Cryptochiton in conjunction with human harvest. Conservation action: Research the relative role of natural predation versus fishing mortality in altering the de nsity and size structure of Katharina and Cryptochiton. This mortality should be factored into the harvest policy experiments suggested above. H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats State and federal agencies, universities, Na tive entities, and NGOs should coordinate to establish a monitoring plan w ithin the next 2 years that would begin annual monitoring with evaluation at 5-year intervals. I. Recommended time frame for reviewing species status and trends Evaluate the strategy after 3 year s and then 5 years after that. J. Bibliography Dethier, M.N. and D.O. Duggins. 1984.

Kenai Alaska Native Language Center. University of Alaska Fairbanks. Shallow Rocky Reef Ecosystem (0-20 meters) Species: Haliotis kamtschatkana A. Species description Common The northern abalone is vulnerable to overharvest and has become commercially extinct in parts of its range (Washington and British Columbia) (Wallace 1999; Jamieson 2001; Adkins 2000). In Alaska, th is species is at the northern limit of its ecological range, increasi ng its vulnerability to poten tial impacts (e.g., harvest pressure or changes in ocean temperatures). In some areas, expansion in the range of sea otters, a major abalone predator, may be increasing natural mortality. A combination of these factors could lead to northern abalone recruitment failures in Southeast Alaska. This species has been declared a \"species at risk\" in British Columbia, Canada, by Environment Canada and a \"species of concern\" in Washington state by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. The concern identified to the south should not stop across international borders , particularly given that this species is at the end of its ecological range in Alaska. B. Distribution and abundance Range : Global range comments : Sloan and Breen (1988) suggest that the northern abalone ranges from Icy Strait at th e northern tip of Sitka Is land, Alaska (approximately 58o North) to Baja Calif ornia (approximately ( 27.5oN). However, O'Clair and O'Clair (1998) indicate that northern abalone exist from Yakutat, Alaska to Point Conception, California. The northern abalone range is also said to ex tend to northern Japan and parts of Siberia. State range comments : Yakutat southward 251 Appendix 4, Page 30 Abundance : Global abundance comments : The northern abalone is patchily distributed, and densities vary spatially depending on huma n harvest pressure, sea otter predation, local recruitment rates, and hydrodynamics fo rces. The following are several reported density estimates from British Columbia, Canada (SL = shell length; see papers for estimates of error): 1) Denman all sizes: 0.06/m2 , 90-110 mm SL: 0.02/m2 (Lucas et BC all sizes: 0.10/m2 , 90-110 mm SL: 0.04/m2 all sizes: 0.16/m2 at McCauley Island, SL: 0.05/m2 McCauley Island, 0.01/m2 Goschen Island (Lucas et al. 4) Bere Bay, Malcom Island, BC all sizes: 0.04/m2, Trinity Bay 0.03/m2, Cormorant Island, BC 0.05/m2 5) Higgins Pass, central coast of BC 0.43-0.52/m2 (Cripps and Campbell 1998) State abundance comments : Abundances vary spatially depending on human harvest pressure, sea otter predation, and local recruitment rates. No specific Alaskan abundance estimates are known. Trends : Global trends : The northern abalone is listed as \"threatene d\" by COSEWIC (Jameison 2001) and is listed as \"threatened\" under the Cana dian Species at Risk Act. In Washington state, the northern abalone is a candidate species for listing under the Endangered Species Act. State trends : unknown C. Problems, issues, or concerns for species Potential and/or Suspected Threats Localized depletion due to harvest a) Mature individuals found in shallo w water are easily accessible to harvesters, making abalone prone to localized depletion. b) Northern abalone larvae disperse over relatively short distances; this species may be particularly vulnerable to localized extirpations (Jamieson 2001). Recruitment limitation increases susceptibility to overharvest a) As a broadcast spawner, the northern abalone requires high densities to ensure successful fertilization. C onsequently, it is susceptible to depensatory (Allee) effects. b) Food web dynamics may also hinder this species. c) GABA-producing coralline crusts induce se ttlement of larv ae; therefore, a lack of browsing adults may redu ce successful recruitment rates. d) Mucus trails of conspecifics may be an important cue to triggering settlement and metamorphosis (Sloan and Breen 1988). Pollution from oil spills, oil and gas platforms, sewage outfall, forestry and mining runoff, anthropogenic and natural heavy metals Pesticide introduction from forestry, ag riculture, and mari culture practices 252 Appendix 4, Page 31 Climate change; changes in ocean temper ature may affect abalone directly by altering their spawning period and length and/or indirectly by affecting the production of their algal food sources a nd/or local current patterns, which influence their metapopulation structure Lack of demographic data Higher trophic level predation, range expa nsion of sea otters increasing natural mortality Disease Contamination from pollution sources (o il spills, oil platfo rm discharge) D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Northern abalone are patchily distributed throughout their range on exposed and semiexposed coasts in close association with kelp beds (Sloan and Breen 1988). In its southern range, H. kamtschatkana is found strictly in the subt idal with most individuals located at 10-20 m depth; however, in its northern range it is found in the lower intertidal to 100 m depth (S loan and Breen 1988). Juvenile s are cryptic and are often found in habitats characterized by crustose coralline algae. Generall y, these habitats are in good condition in Alaska. E. Concerns associated with key habitats Kelp forest degradation due to pollution (sewage discharge, mining, forestry and agricultural runoff) Coastal development Shallow trawling F. Goal: Conserve and manage northern abal one metapopulations throughout their natural range to ensure sustainable use of these resources. G. Conservation objectives and actions State conservation and management objectives and actions : Objective : Develop targets for, and sustain th e population density a nd size structure indicative of, sustainable northern abal one populations reflective of a viable metapopulation throughout their natural range in Alaska. Target: Identify the population density and size structure indicative of sustainable northern abalone populations in Alaska. Measure: Density and size structure of abalone in local populations. Issue 1 : The northern abalone is vulnerable to overexploitation because of its sporadic recruitment, slow growth, longevity a nd late maturity, and sedentary nature. Conservation actions : In collaboration with coas tal communities, establish \"no harvest\" areas (marine abalone reserves) interspersed with abalone harvest areas in order to sustain a minimum density of re productive individuals embedded within a functioning ecosystem. Because juveniles ar e generally found deeper than adults, these marine reserve areas must encompass depths associated with juvenile rearing 253 Appendix 4, Page 32 grounds (i.e. account for broader metapopul ation dynamics). By maintaining egg production, genetic diversity, and functiona l food webs, marine abalone reserves could play an important role in abal one conservation (Shepard and Brown 1993). Issue 2 : Kelp forest degradation may be caused by \"upstream,\" coastal and oceanic pollution. For example, watershed discharg e such as sewage (point and nonpoint sources), forestry, mining and agricultural runoff may degrade abalone habitat (Tegner 1991). Conservation actions: a) Promote the regulation of discharge fr om offshore oil and gas platforms to reduce coastal habitat degr adation and potential contamination of coastal food webs. b) Promote regulation of sustainable forest ry and mining practices in \"upstream\" watersheds to reduce the potential for high turbidity and sediment flows in aquatic ecosystems. c) Promote proper reforestation practices to reduce the use of fertilizers and pesticides. d) Promote the regulation of sewage tr eatment and flow rates to reduce particulates, turbidity levels and toxins that may be discharged during storm events; promote regulations that ensure that sewage settling ponds/fields in rural areas are located far enough away from streams to allow for proper filtration to occur. Issue 3 : Kelp forest degradation can be induced by shoreline development. Furthermore, abalone depend on high flow environments th at are altered by shoreline development activities. Conservation action: Promote regulations that reduce of the amount of shoreline hardening (e.g., sea walls), which can alter regional hydrodynamics. Issue 4 : Alaskan northern abalone die at a water temperature of 16-17oC (Paul and Paul 1981). Conservation action: Promote proper regulation and design of pulp and paper mills and steam power plants that us e ocean water as a coolant. Issue 5 : Lack of demographic and trophic intera ction information. Growth, survival, and recruitment rates, plus estimates on mini mum viable population densities required for successful fertilization, are cr itical pieces of demographi c information required to manage and conserve a species su sceptible to depensatory effects. Conservation actions : a) Determine food web dynamics that contribute to natural mortality. b) Estimate metapopulation dynamics with de nsity and size structure surveys, plus tagging and local ci rculation pattern studies. 254 Appendix 4, Page 33 Issue 6: The species Haliotis kamtschatkana has not been entirely resolved (Sloan and Breen 1988) across its range; cons equently, it remains unclear if we are dealing with one abalone species or a species complex. Conservation action: Collaborate on research projects with international researchers on the genetic analyses of vari ous northern abalone populations. Global conservation and management objectives and actions : Issue: Various concerns regarding northern abalone cross international borders. These animals are broadcast spawners subject to metapopulation dynamics, and the populations in Southeast Alaska may be dependent on Canadian recruits or visa versa. Additionally, scientists are interested in finding out how genetically unique the northern abalone species and populations are with in the Pacific. A variety of other common concerns may be identified. Conservation action: Collaborate with Japanese and Canadian government agencies and universities that are cu rrently devising conservation strategies for the northern abalone. H. Propose plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats State and federal agencies, universities, Na tive entities and NGOs should coordinate to establish a monitoring plan w ithin the next 2 years that would begin annual monitoring with evaluation at 5-year intervals. I. Recommended time frame for reviewing species status and trends Evaluate the strategy after 3 year s and then 5 years after that. J. Bibliography Adkins, B.E. 2000.

State trends : Unknown C. Problems, issues, or concerns for species group The primary dragonfly conservation issue in Alaska is the lack of information on geographic distribution, abundance, and speci es diversity in this large, remote, and undersurveyed state. For example, 10 of Alaska's 31 dragonfly species are known from fewer than 4 locations. Du ring the summer of 2003, a minimal collecting effort by a biologi st found 3 new species previously not known to occur in Alaska. Dragonflies are an important component of freshwater/terrestrial food webs because they are prey for a large variety of inverteb rates and vertebrates and certain carnivorous plants. Dragonflies are also a top invertebrate pr edator in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. As such, they are likely to accu mulate contaminants and transfer them to predators including migratory songbirds. Dragonflies can serve as barometers of environmental health and change in both the aquatic and terrestrial environments. Dragonfly larvae and adults are both pr edaceous, relying on diverse and productive 257Appendix 4, Page 36 invertebrate communities. Th erefore, if the aquatic environment and food web that sustains dragonflies is impaired, dragonflies, and the fishes, amphibians, birds, and mammals that prey on them, will be impacted. D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Dragonfly larvae live in slow streams and rivers, marshes, lakes, ponds, wetlands, and springs. Adult dragonflies use a variety of te rrestrial habitats, bot h near and far from aquatic habitats. Dragonfly ha bitat is generally abundant and widely distributed across the state. However, the condition of dra gonfly habitat in Al aska is not known. Likewise, the specific habitat requiremen ts of our species are poorly understood. E. Concerns associated with key habitats Dragonflies are sensitive to a variety of stressors, includi ng habitat alteration (e.g., air and water quality degradation, in filling, dams, acidification, pesticides and other chemical polluta nts, erosion, eutrophica tion, and sedimentation), urbanization, shoreline development, co llisions with vehicles, heavy metal contamination, fish and domestic duck introductions, commercial peat extraction, and invasive species. An i nvasive species in Southcen tral Alaska, northern pike, feed heavily on dragonfly nymphs afte r all other prey species have been extirpated. Climate change will influence species dist ribution and habitat quality and quantity through melting of permafrost and drought, both of which eliminate lentic and lotic habitats. Dragonfly habitat can be adversely impact ed by resource development activities including mining, logging, and oil an d gas exploration and production. F. Goal: Describe and manage dragonfly populati ons throughout their natural range to ensure sustainable use of these resources. G. Conservation objectives and actions Objective : Describe current geogra phic distribution, abundance within existing range of variation, and species diversit y of dragonflies in Alaska. Target: Survey and map species presence/absence information at 10 sites in each region of Alaska within 5 years (regi ons correspond to the ADF&G joint board anagement regions). m Measure: Number of sites surveyed and documented in each region. Target: Survey larval dragonfly habitat to determine species-specific habitat requirements and the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of each habitat type within 5 years. Measure: Develop a list of species-specific ha bitat requirements for dragonflies in Alaska. Issue 1 : Dragonfly species diversity and distri bution data in Alaska are currently insufficient for determining the conservation st atus of these insects. For example, our limited knowledge of species distributions prevents distinguishing truly rare species from undersurveyed species. 258Appendix 4, Page 37 Conservation actions : a) Conduct a literature review to determine appropriate sampling techniques and protocols and sample sizes. b) Establish an Alaska Odonata Survey to increase knowledge of dragonfly diversity and distribution. c) Compile and synthesize existing distribution data and publications into an electronic database (preferably GIS or compatible). d) Collect immature and adult dragonflies from key habitats and regions not represented in existing collections and literature. e) Compare dragonfly species lists a nd distribution data from the Yukon. Territory and British Columbia with available Alaska data to determine what species might occur here. f) Collaborate with Odonata researchers in neighboring Canadian provinces. g) Develop a network of volunteer collectors. h) Train volunteers to sort and label specimens keyed to family level. i) Use recognized experts to identify specimens. j) Preserve and archive specimen collec tions and associated data at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, Museum of the North, for future research and use. k) Publish a peer-reviewed paper on the dist ribution of dragonflies in Alaska and present the findings at appropriate state, national, and international meetings. Issue 2 : Maintaining healthy dra gonfly populations throughout Alaska requires baseline information on natural spatial and temporal variation in dragonfly abundance. Conservation actions : a) Use on the ground inventory and GIS technology to determine species- specific habitat availability and health by region over 3-5 consecutive years. b) Focus on species/habitats that appear rare or have limited distributions. Issue 3 : Understanding dragonf ly habitat requirements in Alaska is critical for protecting, conserving, and if necessa ry, restoring populations. Conservation actions : a) Identify species-specific habitat associations during surveys. b) Use GIS to predict and map habitat. c) Encourage school districts, Elderhostel, nonprofit organizations, universities, state and federal agencies, and interested individuals to participate in surveys. d) An annual report including survey lo cations and maps of new and old distribution records by species and region should be produced. Conservation actions : a) Identify species-specific habitat associations during surveys. b) Use GIS to predict and map habitat. H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats Presence/absence surveys should begin as soon as funding allows. They should be conducted once per month during the flight season, which varies by area. Surveys should be conducted for 3-5 years. 259Appendix 4, Page 38 I. Recommended time frame for reviewing species status and trends Five years. This interval is necessary because conservation measures may change as data becomes available. Data may show th at human development and climate change are affecting dragonfly habitat and populations. J. Bibliography Ahrens, C.

Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Lakes, ponds, connected wetlands, and sloughs throughout the state. Habitat is mostly in very good or pristine condition. A small and unquantified amount of area damaged by urbanization, road construction, or other development. E. Concerns associated with key habitats Specific threats, limited to minor extent of range, are development-specific and include: nonpoint source hydrocarbon pollution in urbanized areas sedimentation from timber, minera l, or agricultural development water quality degradation (c hanges in pH, organic pollu tants, eutrophication, or heavy metals) from industrial or agricultural development General threats (statewide) to group ar e related to water quality degradation (changes in pH, organic pollutants, or heavy metals) through airborne pollutants and water temperature or level changes related to climate change F. Goal: Conserve and manage Cladocera spp. populations throughout their natural range to ensure sustainabl e use of these resources. 262Appendix 4, Page 41 G. Conservation objectives and actions Objective : Maintain current Cladocera distribu tion, range of abundance, and species diversity throughout their na tural range in Alaska. Target: Document what species occur in each of Alaska's ecoregions by collecting and identifying specimens from 5 sites within each region over 5 years (regions correspond to the ADF&G joint board management regions). Measure: Review existing literature and identi fy the species collected at each site. Target: Obtain baseline data of normally oc curring population dens ities in typical habitats at up to 5 survey sites in each region of Alaska for 5 consecutive years. (Regions correspond to the ADF&G jo int board management regions.) Measure: The population density estimates for Cladocera populations at selected survey sites within in each region of Alaska. Issue : Alaska's Cladocera species, distribu tion, and range of normal abundance are unknown. Conservation actions : a) Compile any existing distribution and abundance data into an electronic database (preferably GIS-based). b) Compare species lists of adjacent area s (Canada, Russian Far East) with available Alaska data to determin e what species might occur here. c) Establish survey protocols and identify possible survey sites. d) Establish abundance estimation protocol s and identify possible study sites. e) Develop a network of volunteer collectors. f) Collect individual specimens and document habitat associations. g) Use recognized experts to identify individual specimens. h) Create a peer-reviewed paper on the dist ribution of Cladocera in Alaska. i) Preserve and archive specimen collecti ons and associated data at the UAF Museum of the North for future research and use. j) Convene an expert task force to review conservation plans of other jurisdictions. k) Convene an expert task force to assess trends, critical ha bitats, threatened species, and to develop a featured sp ecies list and a conservation plan for these species. H . Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats Surveying should begin as soon as funding is available and be conducted yearly for 5 years. Monitoring for species baseline abundan ce and variance should begin as soon as funding is available and be conducted at selected sites every year for 5 consecutive years. Volunteer organization such as schoo l districts, Elde rhostels, nonprofit organizations, state and federal agencies, and interested individuals can collect and share specimen and habitat association information. 263Appendix 4, Page 42 Qualified taxonomists will conduct species identification; data and specimens would be housed at the UAF Museum of the North. Review the conservation plans of other ju risdictions concurrently with data and information collection; assessment and preparation of a feat ured species list would occur after the plan review and the Alaska data review. I. Recommended time frame for reviewing species status and trends Five years. This interval is necessary because conservation measures may change as data becomes available. Data may show th at human development and climate change are affecting Cladocera habitat and populations. J. Bibliography Deevey, E.S., and Deevey, G.B. Jr. 1971. Hebert. 1994.

Distribution and abundance Range : Global range comments: Order are widespread globally, widespread in North America. State range comments: Widespread (in flowing waters), where surveys have occurred. Diversity and abundance are higher in lower latitudes, but representatives of each order are found throughout the state. Rhithrogena n. sp. is currently known only from adults taken at Yukon-Koyukuk region, Birch Creek, 10 miles upstream from mile 147 of the Steese Highway north of Fairbanks. Interestingly, it is most closely related to 2 Siberian species, and not North American species. (Email corres pondence from P. McCafferty, 2004). Abundance : Global abundance comments : Highly variable where documented State abundance comments : Highly variable where doc umented; undocumented in most regions of the state. High levels of abundance are often highly correlated with healthy fish stocks. Rhithrogena n. sp.: unknown Trends : Global trends : Unknown State trends : Unknown Rhithrogena n. sp.: unknown C. Problems, issues, or concerns for species group This group is highly sensitive to heavy metals, organic pollutant contamination, and sedimentation and turbidity. Ephemeroptera/Plecoptera/Trichoptera (EPT ) species are important water quality indicators. The mere presence, abundance, and distribution of these species are indicative of the positive health of waters. The distribution of most re presentatives of the group is limited to flowing waters, and by temperature and pH constraints. The group also represents a major transfer of primary production to many vertebrates, including waterfowl and fish species, in flowing waters. 266Appendix 4, Page 45 D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Primarily found in flowing waters throughout th e state. Habitat is mostly in very good, or pristine condition, al though some localized habitat is threatened by water quality problems directly related to mini ng, logging, or other development. E. Concerns associated with key habitats Specific concerns, limited to minor extent of range, are develo pment-specific and include: Nonpoint source hydrocarbon pollution in urbanized areas Sedimentation from timber, mineral, or agricultural development Water quality degradation (changes in pH , organic pollutants, eutrophication, or heavy metals) from industrial or agricultural development General threats (statewide) to group are related to water quality degradation (changes in pH, organic pollutants, or heavy metals ) through airborne pollutants and water temperature or level changes related to climate change. F. Goal: Conserve and manage Ephemeroptera/ Plecoptera/Trichoptera (EPT) populations throughout their natural range to ensure sustainable use of these resources. G. Conservation objectives and actions Objective : Maintain current geographic distributi on and species diversity of EPT species in Alaska. Target: Document typical species assemblages (l arval stages) that occur in Alaska by collecting and identifying specimens from 5 sites within each region over 5 years. (Regions correspond to the ADF&G jo int board management regions.) Measure: larval species assemblages within each region as determined by site survey and literature review. Target: Obtain relative baseline data of normally occurring population densities. For example, compare annual densities or densities between habitat site s (Oswood et. al. 2001). Measure: Obtain statistically valid popul ation density estimates for EPT populations at up to 5 survey sites in each region of Alaska for 5 consecutive years. (Regions correspond to the AD F&G joint board management regions.) Issue : There is limited information on EPT species in Alaska, their distribution, and their range of normal abundance. Conservation actions : a) Compile existing distribution and abundance data into an electronic database (preferably GIS-based). b) Compare species lists of adjacent area s (Canada, Russian Far East) with available Alaska data to determine what species may occur here. c) Establish survey protocols and identify possible survey sites. d) Establish abundance estimation protocol s and identify possible study sites. e) Develop a network of volunteer collectors. 267Appendix 4, Page 46 f) Collect individual specimens and document habitat associations. g) Use recognized experts to identify individual specimens. h) Create a peer-reviewed paper on the distribution of EPT in Alaska. i) Preserve and archive specimen collections and associated data at the Museum of the North for future research and use. j) Convene an expert task force of expert s to review conserva tion plans of other jurisdictions. k) Convene a task force to assess trends, cri tical habitats, threat ened species, and to develop a featured species list a nd conservation plan for these species. l) Develop species biological indices within regions. H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats Surveying should begin as soon as practical and be conducted yearly for 5 years. Monitoring for species baseline abundan ce and variance should begin as soon as practical and be conducted at selected s ites every year for 5 consecutive years. Volunteer organizations, such as scho ol districts, El derhostels, nonprofit organizations, state and federal agencies, and interested individuals can collect and share specimen and habitat association information.

Species group description Common names : scuds, mites, springtails, beetle la rvae, proboscis worms, flatworms, seed shrimp, water fleas and possible previously unconfirmed and unknown species Scientific names : Stygobromus quatsinensis, Range : Global range comments: Cave adapted invertebrates do not find favorable habitat in all cave systems, but instead occur in envi ronmentally relatively stable cave systems that have a favorable glacia l history and are large enough to have true troglobitic habitat. Human accessibility also further limits the systems from which invertebrate samples can be obtained. Stygobromus sp. has been described from Vancouver Island caves and may be relict populations from gl acial refugial areas. The distributional ranges of many cave-adapted invertebrate s are unknown. These species are often associated with cave habitats where subsurface waters are found predominantly within carbonate rock; vadose cave system s that have pirated surface streams and lakes; drip pools in mud and glacial ma rine outwash sediments, insurgent and resurgent springs, and range comments: Cave-adapted invertebrate habi tats within karst landscapes are scattered throughout Alaska but have been best studied in Southeast Alaska. Stygobromus quatsinensis has only been found on the outer islands of Southeast Alaska (Dall, Coronation, Heceta, Baker, and Suemez). Abundance : Global abundance comments: unknown State abundance comments : limited abundance, unquantified Trends : Global trends : unknown Cavernicole species likely survived in situ during the last glaciation but re- radiative and re-immigrative mechanisms may also have resulted in the current distribution. State trends : unknown In Southeast Alaska, one study of cav erniculous invertebrate species abundance and diversity indicates that thes e parameters decrease from north to south; this trend may be an artifact of the sample site locations on the outer islands were also the southernmost is lands, which could have been glacial refugia. Trends in distribution could also possibly be due to past glacial events and/or associated sea level changes (Carlson 1997). 270Appendix 4, Page 49 In Southeast Alaska, caverniculous i nvertebrate migration from the inner islands to the outer islands is repr esented by a decrease in abundance and diversity from east to west, in the direction of decreas ing probability of glacial coverage. (Carlson 1997). C. Problems, issues, or concerns for species group There is a very limited amount of information about this group. Fauna will likely contain cave-adapted taxa that, due to the following characteristics, make them sensitive to anthropogenic impacts. Use a very limited habitat type Have a low reproductive rate Stenothermic Highly adapted to unique and harsh living conditions Require caves with temperature range equal to the mean annual ambient temperature Require low pH range Tolerance to contaminants is low Recruitment from outside the system is little to none Use a specific habitat that is easily degraded, rendering populations highly vulnerable to habitat destruction In cave ecosystems, a single species of amphipod may dominate a relatively simple food web based on fine organic particulates (Drost and Blinn 1997). Geographic isolation a) Chronic population genetics bottlene cks due to glaciation (Carlson 1997) b) Endemism, which can be highly localized Some populations endemic to a single cave or a small cluster of caves Some of the known cave habitats have been degraded by changes in hydrology and nutrient inputs as a result of timber harvest (including road construction, changes in forest structure, and imp acts on local hydrology) and other extractive industries. On a global scale, karst land scapes are generally rare. Known karst landscapes exist in Africa, Australia and Oceania, Asia, Europe, North America and South America. Karst landscapes underl ying temperate rain forests are even less common, occurring only in Tasmania and Chile. D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Karst landscapes in Southeast Alaska. Over 600 caves have been inventoried on northern Prince of Wales Island and severa l westerly islands (Dall, Coronation, Suemez, Heceta, Baker, and Kosciusko). Ca ves and are also present on Kuiu, Long, Etolin, Revillagigedo, Kupreanof and Chichi gof Islands, as well as some parts of the mainland near Wrangell, areas of Lynn Canal and Haines, and in Glacier Bay National Park. Thousands of caves are estimated to exist on Prince of Wales Island (USFS, 2004). 271Appendix 4, Page 50 El Capitan (in Southeast Alaska) is the largest cave in Alaska; over 2 miles of passage have been mapped from the main entrance. The El Capitan pit is the deepest vertical drop in the United States at 598 ft. Karst also occurs in Wrangell-St. Elias National Park. Extensive karst occurs in the Brooks Range. Smaller pockets are found in places such as the Lime Hills (Southcentral Alaska), and the White Mount ains (Interior Alaska). Some of these karst blocks are similar in geologic ag e but have been accreted to the North American craton in differing positions due to differences in plate tectonics. Karst watersheds: water resources originati ng from lake or surface waters versus groundwater reserves greatly influence the species composition. Aquatic resurgence habitat: aquatic cave dwelling amphipods such as Stygobromus quatsinensis are associated with 37 .4-46.4 degrees F freshwater cave or resurgence stream a nd pool habitats (Carlson 1997). Terrestrial entrance and deep cave hab itats; terrestrial cave-dwelling amphipods such as Robustocheles occulta are associated with entrance as well as deep cave drip pools or organic debris . True aquatic \"deep cave\" habitats characterized by low organic matter, mud-limestone substr ate, absolute darkness, a temperature profile resembling ground temperature, and pHs indicative of carbonate buffering host a fairly simple assemblage Generally the condition of these cave habitats is pristine, although several caves have been degraded due to human visitation, timber harvest, and associated road construction. E . Concerns associated with key habitats Hydrological: a) Silting, sediment and debris accumu lation, and flooding associated with deforestation and logging, forest fires, and dam structures b) Geochemical changes to groundwater pH due to increased tannic acid outwash from runoff due to surface activities c) Overpumping of ground water and loss of watershed groundwater storage capacity due to removal of forest can opy and erosion of thin surface soils causing spring failure and dewatering d) Poorly planned road drainage causi ng groundwater contamination from roading outwash and sediment transport into karst systems e) Groundwater contamination from industrial sites, logging camps, and the application of pesticides Fire: Increased susceptibility to silting, ch anges in pH, loss of watershed storage capacity, increased flashiness of karst syst ems overlain epigean invertebrate species 272Appendix 4, Page 51 Land development: a) Mineral mining and exploration\u2014copper , gold, silver, zinc, lead, uranium and palladium b) Quarrying of caves for limestone, other carbonate rock c) Logging and road construction Strong correlation between karst terrai n and the presence of large trees; high volume karstland forests have b een heavily harvested in the Tongass National Forest. Many roads were origina lly built for log hauling d) Timber industry is still a major employe r; high volume karstland forests have been heavily harvested in the Tongass. Meteorological microclimate alterations, such as opening second entrances and sealing caves Nutrient stress: a) Loss of fine particulate organic matter due to flooding or damming b) Enrichment from sewage, slash, and sediments from logging road construction; fuel leakage from pipelines; nonpoint source pollution Exotic and pest species: Anthropogenically introduced spec ies such as the collembolan Willowsia and Formicid ants may prove to have long- term detrimental effects on cavernicole populations. Chemical pollution: a) Use of pesticides and herbicides, partic ularly along utility corridors, and more recently logging roads in close proximity to caves (The Associated Press 2003) b) Non-point source contamination to the watershed c) Hydrocarbon, heavy metal contamina tion of groundwater from abandoned logging camps d) Military and federal toxic waste sites on Prince of Wales (ACAT 1998) Formerly used defense sites Groundwater contamination sites Hazardous substances Killing, overcollecting, and disturbance of fauna: Most caves have vertical entrances, requiring technical climbing equipment and expertise for entry. Show caves: 1. El Capitan, Prince of Wales Island, Tongass National Forest Longest known cave in Alaska Locked gate guards the cave entrance Guided tours 2. Cavern Lake Cave, Prince of Wales Island, Tongass National Forest F. Goal: Conserve and manage karst cave-dwelling invertebrate populations to ensure sustainable use of these resources. 273Appendix 4, Page 52 G.

Species group description Common names : freshwater clams/mussels; Wester n pearl sp ecies (Baxter [1987] suggested there may be 20 species of bivalves in Alaska) B. Distribution and abundance Range : Global range comments : Poorly known; northwestern No rth America and pan-Arctic. Generally, mollusks have a widespread distri bution but are declini ng in terms of area occupied and number of sites and indivi duals (NatureServe 2004). Mollusks possess limited abilities to disperse with present dist ributions often reflecti ng former (Pleistocene) drainage linkages. State range comments : Poorly known. a) Anodonta beringiana fairly well documented in many part s of the state, mainly north of 61 degrees latitude (Smith 2004); Kamchatk a to central Alaska and into the upper Yukon drainage (Gustafson 1997). b) Beringian species endemic to Alaska: Anodonta kenneryli and Margaritifera falcata are sparingly documented in Southeast Alaska (Smith 2004) Margaritifera falcata found on Revillagigedo Island (Southeast Alaska) and north to Naha Bay at 55 degrees latitude (Gustafson 1997). Abundance : Global abundance comments : Unknown State abundance comments : Unknown 279Appendix 4, Page 58 Trends : Global trends : Unknown; fish host species are known for only about a quarter of the mussel species in North America (Watters 1994) State trends : Unknown; conservation status not yet assessed (NatureServe 2004) C. Problems, issues, or concerns for species group As a water quality indicator species: Aquatic biomonitors; minute levels of some toxins or chronic environmental stressors can cause catastrophically significant losses in mussel communities long before they are noticed in fish populations Presence/absence, spatial distribution, populatio n age structure, tissue and shell chemistry all relative to water quality They are bioaccumulator of contaminants with vertebrates (otter, muskrat, fish) relying on them for food Live over 100 years The spatial and temporal comparison of mussel population age structure may explain timing and causes of species population changes Large aquatic filter feeder Are exposed to toxins or other deleterious environmental conditions at a more acute level than many higher trophic level organisms Their nutrient rich biodepos its (feces) provide an impor tant trophic component of benthic community structure Easily identified/disturbed by the public Complicated biological and reproductive ad aptations, requiring a host fish to brood glochidia (obligate parasites) Vital components of a number of intact salmonid ecosystems Important biomedical research implica tions for cancer (resistance to tumors) Are relatively late at maturing (6 12 years old) Currently one of the most endangere d faunal groups in North America Distribution and host fish information widely unknown Population health and numbers rely on the health of certain, but unknown, fish species and populations Can be an important subsistence food D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Anodonta beringiana associated with slow-moving streams or lakes; prefers sand and gravel substrate Anondonta kennerlyi associated with lakes, ponds a nd slow-moving streams; visible in shallow areas Margaritifera falcata associated with rivers; prefer s gravel substrate, often wedged between rocks Locations of existing populations are limited to certain lakes, ponds, sloughs, slow-moving streams, and rivers. The condition of these habitats is mostly very good or pristine. 280Appendix 4, Page 59 E. Concerns associated with key habitats Pollution; mussel larvae are more sensitive to pollutants than adults Mussels have a mandatory parasitic stage, th us are totally dependent on specific fish species, not all of which are known a) Anodonta kennerlyi : host fish currently unknown; associated unknown fish habitat closely linked to A. kennerlyi habitat b) Anodonta beringiana: 3 known host Fuller Margaritifera falcata : known host fish include Chinook salmon; rainbow, brook, and brown trout; possibly sockeye salmon Fish passage barriers Consumption of small mussels by fish and th eir subsequent elimination from fish's gut unharmed may be an important di stribution mechanism; thus mussel populations are even more dependent on th e distribution of certain unknown fish populations. Siltation Juvenile mussels must fall from the host fish onto suitable substrate for their adult life requirements or they will not survive; shifting sands, suspended fine mud, clays, and silt are considered harmful to juveniles and adult mussels. Climatic change may result in potentially da ngerous falling water le vels (due to longer ice-free periods, permafrost melting, and drought) Alterations in water temperature a) Spawning is stimulated by a change in water temperature. b) The duration of the parasitic glochidia stage (generally 5-120 days) is water temperature dependent. Water withdrawals due to human activ ities could threaten populations Invasive species: Species such as the zebra mussel ( New driven a number of freshwater mussel species to extirpation in other states. F. Goal: Conserve and manage freshwater musse l populations througho ut their natural range to ensure sustainabl e use of these resources. G. Conservation objectives and actions Objective 1 : Maintain current freshwater mussel distribution and species diversity. Target: Document what species occur in each of Alaska's ecoregions by collecting adults (preferably shells) from numerous sites over 5 consecutive years (regions correspond to the ADF&G Board of Fisheries management regions); perform DNA and mitochondrial genetic assays. 281Appendix 4, Page 60 Measure: The number of species and locations identified should not be increasing significantly by the fifth year of the study. Issue : Species diversity and dist ribution in Alaska is unknown. Conservation actions : a) Conduct literature search/review of existi ng references and compile existing data into a database (electronic, pr eferably GIS or compatible). b) Compare species lists of adjacent countries with available Alaska data to determine what species might occur here. c) Establish survey protocols and identify possible survey sites. d) Develop a network of volunteer collectors. e) Collect individual specimens and document habitat associations. f) Recruit recognized experts to identify individual specimens. g) Create a peer-reviewed paper on the distribut ion of freshwater mussels in Alaska. h) Preserve and archive specimen collections a nd associated data for future research and use. i) Convene an expert task force to review conservation plans of other jurisdictions. j) Convene an expert task force to assess tr ends, critical habitats , threatened species, and to develop a featured species list a nd a conservation plan for these species. Objective 2 : Maintain and maintain bivalve populati ons within existing range of variability. Target: Obtain baseline data of normally occurr ing population densitie s at undisturbed key habitat types (for example, lake, pond, river). Measure: Obtain statistically valid population density estimates for bivalve populations at up to 30 survey sites in each region of Alaska for 5 consecutive years. (Regions correspond to the ADF&G Board of Fish management regions.) Issue 1 : Population variance is unknown for any Alaska bivalve habitats. Issue 2 : Urbanization can create or destroy habitats. Issue 3 : Invasive species introductions may nega tively impact habitats and kill individual bivalves. Conservation actions : a) Compare urban and undisturbed populations to understand which species benefit from, or are compromised by, disturbance. b) Survey for invasive species when conducting bivalve fieldwork. Objective 3 : Describe the fish species/subpopulations for larval obligate existing currently known whitefi sh, grayling, and salmon (host species) range information. Measure: Distribution maps develope d by fisheries researchers. 282Appendix 4, Page 61 Issue : Variations in obligate fish host populatio ns may affect mussel population maintenance. Conservation actions: a) Collect individual specimens and document habitat associations. b) Survey for present resident and nonresident fish species (and life stages) to aid in identifying specific glochidia host species and life stage of host species. Objective 4 : Educate the public on biva lve conservation issues. Target: An informed public that better understa nds the importance of bivalves and their habitat. Measures: a) Number of participants in bivalve distribution surveys. b) Number of visits to bivalve website. c) Number of public presentations and educational seminars including bivalve conservation information. Issue: The public knows little about freshwater bivalves, thus cannot collaborate in their protection. Conservation actions : a) Prepare and distribute a general informati on publication suitable for laypersons and policymakers. b) Give presentations to various forums, including symposia, outdoors shows, and conventions in Alaska, the Pacifi c Northwest, and elsewhere. c) Post an article in the ADF&G Divisi on of Wildlife Conservation electronic newsletter and newspapers. d) Post information on bivalves on the ADF&G website. e) Enlist volunteer organization, such as sc hool districts, Elde rhostels, nonprofit organizations, state and federal agencies, a nd interested individuals, to collect and share specimen and habitat association information. H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats Surveying should begin immediately both at select ed and opportunistic sites. It should be conducted once each year for at least 5 years or until a statistically ade quate number of likely habitats have been surveyed, the number of ne w species found levels off, and all reports of mussel populations are investigated. I. Recommended time frame for reviewing species status and trends Five years. This interval is necessary because conservation measures may change as data becomes available. Data may show the need to develop conservations actions if human development, invasive species, and climate chan ge are negatively affecting bivalve habitats and populations. 283Appendix 4, Page 62 J.

Terrestrial invertebrates include all of the groups listed at the end of this introduction, in order from most primitive (worms) to highly evolved (insects). The list illustrates the incredible diversity of species represented by this group. Currently, there are no federal or state listed terrestrial invertebrates in Alaska. Information from the coterminous United States i ndicates that invertebrate pop ulations of concern\u2014like many declining bird, mammal and am phibian populations\u2014are affected by habitat degradation and habitat loss 87% of the time, and by pollution 45% of the time, among other factors (Stein et al. 2000). This is important because it te lls us that the factors that cause species to become rare often operate in similar fashion for invertebrates as fo r the vertebrate species that humans tend to be more aware of and to value more highly. By the same token, management efforts that benefit an important bird species, for example, could also ha ve positive benefits for the invertebrate species that share its habitat. Invertebrates are often keystone components of th e habitats and ecosystems of the more familiar vertebrate species that we value. It is perhap s difficult to appreciate th e importance of microbes and worms, which are essential for the improve ment of soil fertility. In the Arctic, large populations of mites, collembolans (springtails), enchytraeid worms, and insect larvae assist in decomposition by breaking down plant and animal material (CAFF 2001). Decomposition helps determine the amount of organic matter accumulate d in the soil. Thus, it is essential to soil fertility and plant growth upon which all terrestrial animals ultimately depend. Less difficult perhaps is some appreciation for bees, which are known to pollinate a wide diversity of domestic and wild pl ants. In the late 1980s, the value of insect- (that is, mostly bee-) pollinated crops in the United States was estim ated as ranging between $4.6 billion and $18.9 billion (Daily and Ellison 2002). Plants that rely on pollinators include potatoes, almonds, soybeans, onions, carrots, and many greenhouse crops . The decline of native pollinators in many areas has had significant economic impacts on cash crops (Kevan and Phillips 2001). Therefore, it is no surprise that farmers a nd gardeners whose crops rely on native pollinators have begun to incorporate some common-sense conservation practices, includi ng protecting na tural habitat where native bees and other beneficial insects can thrive; leaving enough wildland to provide a functioning habitat; buffering these important areas from areas where pesticides are being used; mixing crops where possible and maintaining w eedy borders, ground cover, and hedge-rows; and aiming for sequential flowering so that there will be nectar and pollen year-round for the beneficial insects. Many of thes e practices are intended to mimic what intact natural ecosystems already provide. In Alaska, where farms are relatively few in comparison to the Lower 48, the economic importance of pollinators is best illustrated by their usefulness in natural systems and their vital role in maintaining sport and subsistence hunting. Most insect pollination in the Arctic is done by flies and by bumblebees (Pielou 199 4). Many of the plants that be nefit from their activity, such as the arctic willow ( Salix arctica ), are highly important to ca ribou, which in turn are highly important to humans for their meat and hides. 286 Appendix 4, Page 65 Invertebrates are important food sources for othe r species. A wide-ranging Alaskan species such as the Blackpoll Warbler, for example, eats aphids, flies, beetles, gnats, mosquitoes, wasps, ants and spiders (Hunt and Eliason 1999). The breedin g seasons for many birds occur when insect populations are at their hi ghest levels. Little is know about bats in Alaska, but elsewhere their diets depend heavily on both terrest rial and aquatic invertebrates. Spiders composed 15% of the estimated diet volume of the little brown bat ( Myotis lucifigus ) in Southeast Alaska (Parker 1996) and 16% in central Alaska (Whitaker and Lawhead 1992). Many recent studies have considered the potential of invertebrates as re liable indicators of disturbance or degradation in terrestrial systems (Holliday 1991; Niemela et al. 1993; Anderson 1997; Blair Rodrigu ez et al. 1998). Terrestrial inve rtebrates are prevalent, have high species diversity, are easy to sample, and are important in ecosystem function (Rosenberg et al. 1986). They respond to environmental changes mo re rapidly than vertebrates and can provide early detection of ecological changes (Kremen et al. 1993). They also have diverse roles in natural environments that include functioning as decomposers, predators, parasites, herbivores, and pollinators, and these roles are affected by various perturbations. Some studies have examined the responses of various taxa, including ground beetles (family Carabidae), ants (family Formicidae), and butte rflies, to urbanization, logging, agricultural practices, and fire. More recently, studies have attempted to examine terrestrial invertebrate assemblages across a range of disturbance events, with the goal of selecting groups that respond in a consistent manner to various types of disturbance, and using those for developing a terrestrial index of biological integrity. Similarl y to the aquatic indices now in use, terrestrial indices would provide an objectiv e way to assess the biological c ondition of various sites, which is the ultimate key to successful restor ation, mitigation, and conservation efforts. Traditional management has taken a single-spec ies perspective focusing on the activities that directly threaten declini ng species. It is not likely that we ca n successfully conserve invertebrate diversity if we try to surve y, study, manage, and monitor invertebrates one by one. The loss of species interactions and their ecological functions may be of even greate r consequence than the loss of one or more individual species (Levin and Levin 2002; Soule et al. 2003). Management that takes a broad multi-species and -systems pers pective may be essential to the conservation of invertebrate species and the ecosy stems of which they are a part. We are hampered by our lack of specific information about the vari ous ecosystem functions of terr estrial invertebrates. As an ideal, however, we strive toward holistic and adaptive ecosystem-based management of Alaska's terrestrial systems to maintain functioning landscapes and natural communities. Our knowledge of the status of te rrestrial invertebrates is less than that of any other taxonomic group. For this reason, it is virtually impossible to co me up with a list of species of invertebrates of concern that would be at all comparable to lis ts for vertebrates. In addition, vertebrate groups are split out much more fine ly than the tremendous and di verse group of animals lumped together here as \"terre strial invertebrates.\" One logical starting point for terrestrial inverteb rate conservation efforts would be to focus on the habitats for terrestrial invertebrates with in the 7 general habitat types identified by the 287 Appendix 4, Page 66 planning team: forests, tundra, fr eshwater aquatic, wetlands, mari ne aquatic and coastline, sea ice, and karst caves. Appendix 5 describes each of these complex habitat types and subtypes, associated species ecological importance, stat us, and recommendations for conservation. Table 34, Section VI, lists these types and the standard subtypes for which experts identified concrete information regarding species' ha bitat requirements. Forest (boreal, coastal temperate rain forest), tundra (alpine, arctic, maritime), we tland (grass, sedge, bog, salt marsh), and karst cave (entrance zone, twilight zone, deep cave zone ) habitats would be especially important for terrestrial invertebrates. In May 2003, a number of invert ebrate experts participated in a Candidate Conservation Workshop, organized by USFWS (Judy Jacobs, pers . comm.). They identified a number of high priority activities; many of these are captured in the Terrestrial Invertebrates Template below. The group also identified several areas and specialized ha bitats that require survey. The potential to identify new and habitat-limited invertebrates, as well as plants and mammals, is high in these places. They include the isolated Nogahabara Dunes and Great Kobuk Dunes of northwest Alaska; the steppes and south-f acing slopes of the southern Y ukon River, which include rare plants and vegetation similar to western Beringia during the last glaciation; the 3000 feet of south-facing slopes asso ciated with Castle Mountain; the Kenai Peninsula with its mix of maritime and continental climates; and the Aleutian Islands and the Seward Peninsula with its associated coastal islands, which were all c onnected at one time to Asia and the Russian paleoarctic as part of the Be ring Land Bridge. Urbanizing area s, such as Anchorage, the Matanuska-Susitna valleys, and Fairbanks , also may require immediate study. Based on limited information, we have included 2 groups of potentially ra re invertebrates in Alaska: the western bumblebee and land snails. C oncerns for their status are presented next. The western bumblebee ( Bombus occidentalis ) once ranged from northern California northward along the Pacific Coast; it has declined precip itously from northern California to British Columbia. Very few if any specimens have been collected in California, Oregon, and Washington in the last few years. More recently, bees in British Columbia seem to be declining dramatically as well. The decline may be a ssociated with a pathogen introduced by nonnative bees. We do not know if this species is waning in Alaska, or if it is already extirpated. There are two morphologically different forms of this bumblebee, an interior form, and a Pacific coastal form. Biologists speculate that the in terior form is still abundant, but status of the coastal form is unknown. Similarly, little information is available for the land snails of the Arctic and boreal habitats of North America. Baxter (1983) summarized the fe w earlier reports of Alaskan land snails at 31 species. Additional work by Brian Coles (2002, Univ ersity of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, unpublished) in the Anchorage region added 10 speci es for the state, show ing that some wetlands contain an undescribed (and perhaps endemic) Vertigo species, and that other species also are highly restricted in range and/or habitat, with a striking clin e of species from Anchorage to Girdwood (boreal-Pacific north-west) . Arctic Alaska is almost unexplored for land snails, yet they can be a common component of the Arctic tundra (e.g., Vertigo hannai is abundant in the tundra of Churchill, Manitoba; Jeff Nekola, University of Wisconsin - Green Bay, and Brian Coles, University of Arkansas for Medical Sc iences, 2003, unpublished). Further work needs to 288 Appendix 4, Page 67 be done to determine whether these snails are ende mic to their type localities or more widely distributed. Terrestrial Invertebrates \"Animals Without Backbones\" (Note: The following information was derived fr om BIOSIS; it is based on a simplified and somewhat abbreviated classification scheme for the animal kingdom following the Zoological Record indexing service.) Phylum Nematoda : includes round, thread (some), whip, lung, hook, and eel worms Many nematodes are free living and play critical ecological roles as decomposers and predators on microorganisms; also include parasitic species. On e study reported around 90,000 individual nematodes in a single rotting apple. Another reported 236 species living in a few cubic centimeters of mud. The number of described species is around 12,000, but too little attention has been paid to these animals and the true number may be closer to 500,000 (Myers 2001). Phylum Annelida : includes leeches, earthworms, terrestrial bristle worms Currently, more than 830 species of annelids representing 27 families, 12 orders, and 5 classes (Oligochaeta, Aphanoneura, Branchiobdellae, A canthobdellae, and Hirudinea) are recognized as occurring in the U.S. and Canada; these include both native and introduced species (Coates et al. 2003). Many species function as decomposers, and enhance soil properties. Phylum Mollusca : includes slugs, land snails, and their relatives (gastropods) Gastropods are by far the largest group of molluscs. Their 40,000 species comprise over 80% of living molluscs. Gastropod feeding habits are extremely va ried. Some graze, some browse, some feed on plankton, some are scavengers or detritivores, and some are active carnivores (Myers and Burch 2001). Phylum Arthropoda : includes crustaceans, arachnids, and insects; easily the largest phylum of all animals and of great economic importance Class Malacostraca : includes many marine, freshwater species; also terrestrial isopods Order Isopoda: isopods, pill Class Arachnida: spiders, mites, ticks, Class Pentastomida: Class Diplopoda: millipedes Class Entognatha: minute arthropods mostly found in leaf litter and soil Order Collembola: springtails Order Protura: proturans Order Diplura: diplurans Class Coleoptera: Order Dermaptera: flies Appendix 4, Page 68 Order Hemiptera: true bugs, aphids, plant lice, cicadas, mealy bugs, scale insects, jumping plant lice Order Hymenoptera: wasps, ants, bees, sawflies Order Isoptera: termites, white ants Order Lepidoptera: butterflies and moths Order Mallophaga: bird lice, biting lice Mecoptera: scorpionflies Order Neuroptera: dobsonflies, doodlebugs, lacewings grasshoppers , groundhoppers, katydids, locusts Order Psocoptera: bark lice, book lice Order Siphonaptera: fleas Order Strepsiptera: twisted wing insects Order Thysanoptera: thrips Order Thysanura: bristletails, silverfish Literature Cited Anderson, A.N. 1997.

Problems, issues, or concerns for species group The primary issue for terrestrial invertebrate s in Alaska is the lack of information on geographic distribution, abundance, habitat use, and species diversity in this large, remote, and under-surveyed state. Many common habitats and most unique ha bitats are under-surveyed. Little work has been conducted off the existing road system. Insects associated with rare plants need additional study. In many cases, the ability to identify species with appropriate taxonomic keys and species descriptions is lacking. Existing information is scattered and not compiled in a consistent, accessible fashion. Many specimen collectio ns are outside of Alaska. Coordination of efforts could be improved. Communication among experts, interested managers, and general public also could be enhanced. The important roles of terrestrial invertebrates, even when known, are not appreciated and are underv alued by most people. Endemic species need to be identifi ed and conservation status assessed. Response of various groups to climate change is uncertain. Establishment of baseline informati on on populations would permit proactive management. D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Habitat for many terrestrial invertebrates ge nerally is assumed to be abundant and widely distributed across the state. The sp ecific habitat requirem ents of many species, however, are poorly understood. An evaluation of habitat locations and conditions is needed. E. Concerns associated with key habitats Unknown at present; since habitat loss and degrada tion are the most common causes of species' declines, it will be im portant to identify key, important, and unique habitats for future conservation efforts. Climate change will influence species di stribution, habitat quality, and habitat quantity. F. Goal: Ensure terrestrial inverteb rates remain sustainable th roughout their range within natural population-level vari ation and historical di stribution across Alaska. 292 Appendix 4, Page 71 G. Conservation objectives and actions State conservation and management objectives and actions : Objective : Assess and describe current geogra phic distribution, abundance within existing range of variation, and species divers ity of terrestrial inve rtebrates in Alaska. Target: Survey unique, threatened, or representa tive habitats (at least 2 sites) for key or priority terrestrial invertebrates in each Alaska stat e region in the next 10 years. Measure: Spreadsheet documenting baseline species presence/absence information, current state rank (SRANK) fo r priority species, and GIS distribution and range maps for priority species. Target: Survey and assess habitats of 10 pr iority species to determine species- specific habitat needs, and the physical, chem ical, and biological characteristics of each habitat type in the next 10 years. Measure: Description of species-specific habitat requirements for priority species; maps of key, important, and unique habitats. Issue 1 : Terrestrial invertebrate species divers ity and distribution da ta in Alaska are currently insufficient for determining their conservation status. For example, our limited knowledge of species distributions prevents di stinguishing truly rare species from under- surveyed species. Conservation actions : a) Compile and synthesize existing distribution data and publications into an electronic database (preferably GIS). b) Work with experts and managers to identify information gaps. c) Compare species lists and distributio n data from the Yukon Territory and British Columbia with available Alaska data to determine what species might occur here. d) Establish survey priorities to target ra re, unique, threatened, or representative habitats. e) Establish survey priorities to target ra re, declining, keystone , or representative species, including species asso ciated with rare plants. f) Conduct a literature review to determine appropriate sampling techniques and protocols, and sample sizes. g) Conduct inventories. h) Establish an Alaska invertebrate su rvey, and employ bio-blitz or rapid bioassessment technology to increase knowledge of terrestrial invertebrate diversity and distribution. 293 Appendix 4, Page 72 i) Train observers in species identificati on and collection of unknown species for taxonomic identification (including usi ng molecular methods); use recognized experts to identify specimens. j) Develop a network of volunteer collec tors. Encourage school districts, Elderhostels, nonprofit organizations, unive rsities, state and federal agencies, public schools, and interested individua ls to participate in surveys. k) Collaborate with terrestrial invertebrate researchers in Canadian Provinces and Russia. l) Develop a series of manuals to provide current information on the identification, distribution, and habitat of Alaska's rarer terrestrial invertebrate species. m) Develop a general guide to Alaskan in sects to raise public awareness and perhaps spur additional ins ect observations and reports. n) Preserve and archive specimen collec tions and associated data at the University of Alaska Museum as feasible for future research and use. Issue 2 : Maintaining healthy terrestrial inve rtebrate populations throughout Alaska requires baseline information on natural spat ial and temporal variation in species' abundance. Conservation actions : a) Use on-the-ground assessments, modeli ng and GIS technology to determine species-specific habitat av ailability and quality. b) Focus on species/habitats that appear rare or have limited distributions. Issue 3 : Understanding species' habitat requirements in Alaska is critical for protecting and conserving populations. Conservation actions : a) Identify species-specific habitat associations during surveys. b) Use GIS to predict and map habitat. c) An annual report including survey lo cations and maps of new and old distribution records by species and region should be produced. H. Propose plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats Presence/absence surveys should begin as s oon as funding allows and continue until all priority species and habitats have been addressed. I. Recommended time frame for reviewing species status and trends Five years. This interval is necessary because conservation measures may change as data become available. 294 Appendix 4, Page 73 J.

New York. 399 p. 295 Appendix 4, Page 74 Marine Fish - Introduction Species known as \"forage fish\" play a critic al role in Alaska's marine ecosystems and coastal areas. They are the pr incipal link between primary and secondary producers (e.g., phytoplankton and zooplankton) and apex predatory species (e.g., seabirds, marine mammals, and large fishes). These species of ten also constitute important dietary or ecological components for terrestrial-oriented species. C onsumption of these marine fishes by terrestrial predators in the intertid al zone provides susten ance for those species (e.g., crows feeding on sand lance) and indirect ly spreads nutrients into the terrestrial system. Consumption of forage fish by marine pr edators, such as seabirds that return to shore, helps sustain the birds, brings nutrients to coastal te rrestrial systems, and plays a part in longer food chains that include species that prey upon seabirds and sea ducks or their young, including humans. Critical habitat for forage fish species that ar e important in terrestrial ecosystems can be divided into intertidal habitats and shallow pe lagic habitats. Intertid al habitats are used temporarily on a seasonal basis by embryonic, la rval, juvenile and adult stages of some key forage fish species for shelter, fe eding and rearing, and spawning. Meanwhile, shallow pelagic habitats are used year-round by other key forage species. Both habitats serve as important nursery areas for forage fish. The CWCS features a suite of forage fish species known to be critical for healthy ecological function in each of these 2 habitat categories; these fish are regarded as indicator species. Prior research on forage fish shows that the species selected are either: a) the locally dominant prey biomass in ma ny Alaska nearshore areas, or b) a frequent component of Alaskan predator diets. Their conservation needs are representative of the needs for many other nearshore and intertidal species. Since none of the featured forage fish species are commercially harvested, management actions will likely focus on habitat protection rather than on organism protection. Habitat protection is especially crucial in fora ge fish nursery areas because the early life history stages of forage fishes are often more sensitive to a broad range of pollutants than are adult stages. In addition, for Alaskan wa ters, recirculation and nearshore vertical stratification (largely due to density differences from the input of freshwater) can result in concentration of terrestrial or nearshore-sourced pollutants. Th is is in contrast to areas with lower freshwater input where estuarine circ ulation helps remove or dilute pollutants. Because human activity often concentrates in nearshore coastal areas, aquatic input of petroleum hydrocarbon compounds , sewage, and industrial or household chemical waste to these most sensitive of marine areas is also potentia lly high. Given the critical ecological role of forage fish, conservation actions designed to pr otect the key species and habitats shown on the following templates will likely benefit not only other species of forage fish, but also other marine speci es more widely recognized as valuable to human society. 296 Appendix 4, Page 75 Forage Fish Occurring in Inte rtidal/Shallow Subtidal Areas A. Species group description Common name : Intertidal/shallow subtidal forage fish (esp. Pacific sand lance, capelin, h; and intertidal fish [e.g., sculpins, pricklebacks, and gunnels]); some members of this group ar e also called small schooling fish (see definition found in Forage Fishes in Marine Ecosystems , 1997) Scientific ) B. Distribution and abundance Range : Global range comments : Circumpolar (capelin, intertidal fishes); Northeast Pacific (intertidal fishes) State range comments: Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea (eulachon, Pacific sandfish), and throughout coastal Alaska (Pacific sand lance, capelin, sculpins, pricklebacks, and gunnels) Abundance : Global and state abundance comments : unknown State abundance comments : unknown1 1 Pacific sand lance and capelin may dominate local assemblages by biomass; the listed species and groups are key species serving important trophic roles in the transfer of energy to larger predator s, such as marine birds and mammals and commercially important fish. Trends : Much annual variation but trends unknown Global trends : Capelin and Pacific sand lance trends variable with climate in North Atlantic; for other species, trends are unknown State trends : Unknown for all References : Alaska Sea Grant College (1997); Brow n (2002); Mecklenburg et al. (2002); Robards et al (1999) 297 Appendix 4, Page 76 C. Problems, issues, or concerns for species group These are key species that play a critical role in Alaska's marine ecosystems. They are the primary link between pr imary and secondary producers (e.g., phytoplankton and zooplankton) and apex predatory species (e.g., seabirds, marine mammals, and large fishes); however, data on the forage fish species currently are sparse. This paucity of da ta and understanding of intertidal/shallow subtidal fish reduces the ability to lin k effects of climate change and other environmental changes on forage fishes with changes in the apex communities that are of both social and economic importance (e.g., whales, birds, commercially harvested fishes). Susceptible to adverse effects from degradation of subtidal and intertidal substrates or beaches (substrates used for spawning and burrowing habitat; exact substrate is species-specific). Susceptible to habitat modification (jetties, etc). Anthropogenic and natural changes to ri verine and estuarine hydraulics and morphology can impact eulachon and many other forage fish species. Susceptible to subtidal, intertidal , estuarine and riverine pollution. Lack of swim bladder in some species, benthic orientation, an d/or shallow water distribution makes standard acoustic su rvey and some net sampling techniques difficult. Capelin, Pacific sand lance, and Pacific sandfish have been and could again be considered for a possible commercial fishery in Alaska; the potential effects to these populations are unknown. Very little is known about distribu tion, abundance, and life history. D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Pacific sand lance: For spawning and bu rrowing, subtidal areas as well as protected and semi-protected clean fine substrate beaches within their range; condition unknown but currently thought to be pristine over much of the range. Capelin: For spawning, subtidal areas as we ll as exposed or semi-protected clean fine substrate beaches within thei r range; condition unknown but currently thought to be pristine over much of the range. Eulachon: For spawning, rivers with in their range; condition unknown but currently thought to be pristi ne over much of the range. Pacific sandfish: Juveniles and nonspawning adults prefer soft to sandy subtidal substrate; at the time of spawning, they deposit egg clusters on nearshore rocky areas or rock ledges with modest currents. Intertidal fish (e.g., sculpins, prickleback s, gunnels): Need substrates (living or not) for nesting, brooding, rearing; prickl ebacks may be a primary colonizer in periglacial environments that consis t of high amounts of glacial silt. In general, status and condition of all these habitats is unknown. References : Baxter (1997); Love (2004). 298 Appendix 4, Page 77 E. Concerns associated with key habitats See Section C, above Anthropogenic and natural (e.g., earthquake, uplift) changes to shore habitats Pollution (including eutrophicati on, outfalls, sedimentation) Spilled pollutant (e.g. oil tr ansport, toxic plume) pathways parallel the food pathway for these species; mechanisms that produce important spawning and rearing habitats are the same mechanisms that transport spills to them Climate change; change in storm patterns , sea level rises and change in sea ice distribution Interaction with exotic species (e.g., new predators, disease, parasites), including as a result of increased vessel traffic a nd associated ballast water discharge Dredge and fill F. Goal: Conserve and manage inte rtidal/shallow subtidal forage fish populations throughout their natural range to ensure sustainable use of these resources. G. Conservation objectives and actions Objective A : Sustain populations of the indicated in tertidal/shallow subtidal forage fish species within their natural range of abundance. Target: Level trend (recognizing potential for la rge inter-annual variability) in annual abundance of each sampled species as measured over a ten-year cycle. Measure: Trend analysis of abundance in inte rtidal/shallow subtidal forage fish species using annual measurements over a ten-year cycle, based on information from the baseline survey sites. Objective B : Maintain the quality and quantity of coastal habitat needed to sustain intertidal/shallow subtidal forage fish populations within their natural range of abundance. Target: Maintain 100% of the ve ry good-to-pristine conditi on habitat required to maintain viable sustainable populations of each intertidal/shallow subtidal forage fish stock. Measure: A baseline map of available intert idal/shallow subtidal forage fish habitats against which to compare future monitoring results. (Issues and conservation actions below apply to one or both objectives.) Issue 1 : There is a paucity of information about intertidal/shallow subtidal forage fish species and their habitats, and a lack of commitment to long-term monitoring. Generally, very little appears to be know n about intertidal/shallow subtidal forage fish distribution, abundance, life history, and habitat requirements/use. Few documented baselines exist (especially outside Southcentral and Southeast Alaska) against which to compare future population or habitat monitoring results. There is limited information available on how habitats change naturally over time; difficult to separate anthropogenic from natura l (climate, uplift, etc.) variability in loss/degradation/gain of habitats. Likely sources of \"traditional knowledge\" a bout intertidal/shallow subtidal forage fish abundance and habitat use have not been determined. 299 Appendix 4, Page 78 Conservation actions: a) Establish a network of monitoring sites. b) Determine minimum number of sites n eeded for statewide index (see draft network). c) Annually survey forage fish populations by conducting recruitment surveys at index locations around the coast, and repor t decadal trends in the scientific and popular literature; conduct recruitment surveys via airplane or boat, or use beach seine and other net sampling techni ques, and conduct intertidal transect surveys for intertidal species. d) Determine the ecosystem function at the specific monitoring sites through collaboration with other agency proj ects (e.g., salmon, halibut, seabird, marine mammal diet surveys). (This entails eval uating the flow of energy through the system and what dictates or regulates that flow, as well as the stability and resiliency of the system [i.e., if perturbed will the system return to its former composition or resume a new state w ith different energy flow rates and forcing regulators].) e) If there is extensive overlap among site s recommended by the different expert groups, consider putting together an LTER proposal at a designated site. f) Develop ecological trophic interaction models for comparing among sites and over time based on data collected in Conservation Action (d), above. (This work delineates predator/prey relationships and defines feeding/predation/ consumption rates either in numeric or energetic currency. This is a critical and necessary part of mapping energy flow in ecosystem function.) g) Establish a baseline map of available habitats used by intertidal/shallow subtidal forage fish against which to compare future monitoring results. h) Add known forage fish habitat to NOAA's environmental sensitivity index maps. i) Map known, and survey and map unknown, in tertidal/shallow subtidal forage fish habitat. j) Develop a trend analysis of habitat use by intertidal/shallow subtidal forage fish using annual measurements over a 10-year cycle, based on information from the baseline survey sites. k) Develop a trend analysis of the amount and quality of habitat, using annual measurements over a 10-year cycle, based on information from the baseline survey sites. l) Prioritize and link known habitat requirem ents for forage fish to existing coastal habitat maps; use literature values (densities, etc.) to extrapolate what potential population levels could be. m) Measure and map the rate of change (loss/gain) of key habitats. n) Measure and map the rate of change in percentage overlap of fish distribution with mapped habitat. o) Develop multiple methods to link habitat use to abundance. p) Collaborate with community leaders to id entify and tap sources of local and/or traditional knowledge familiar with local forage fish abundance and habitat use. 300 Appendix 4, Page 79 Issue 2 : There is a paucity of public knowledge and understanding about, or interest in, intertidal/shallow subtidal forage fish and their habitats. Little knowledge by the public about fora ge fish distribution, abundance, life history, and habitat (especially among t hose not traditionally using or observing forage fish species) Lack of public understanding of the importance of forage fish and forage fish habitat in the ecosystem Conservation actions : a) Develop a public citizenry in Alaska that is well educated about the importance of forage fish assemblages a nd their habitats as a key element in Alaska's marine ecosystems and underst ands how forage fish form a linkage between comprehensive research on climate change and trends in apex predator populations. b) Establish information and education in terchange mechanisms (active hands-on websites). c) Establish citizen education and information exchange programs directed, at a minimum, to key monitoring sites. d) Integrate intertidal/shallow subtidal fora ge fish and their habitat needs into existing fish curricula , including homeschooling. e) Involve local residents in planning and conducting sampling and monitoring programs. f) Mentor local leaders regarding benef its and importance of the program. Issue 3: Education programs lack flexibil ity, with budget and time constraints limiting options to incorporat e new material or customize it for the local area; outreach/start-up funding is needed (ove r and above the normal allocation for education) for field sampling equipment, travel, and salary for additional human resources needed to begin and mainta in the program. Homeschooling curricula needs to be considered since homeschooling is widespread in Alaska, especially in more remote areas. Conservation action: Integrate intertidal/shallow subtidal forage fish and their habitat needs into existing fish curricula, including home schooling. Issue 4 : Lack of public support can jeopardize efforts to implement conservation measures. Conservation actions : a) Involve local residents in planning and conducting sampling and monitoring programs. b) Mentor local leaders regarding benef its and importance of the program. 301 Appendix 4, Page 80 Issue 5 : Policies for better maintaining intertidal/s hallow subtidal forage fish stocks and their habitats may be needed. The public appears to have a low awarene ss of how their activities can adversely affect the marine ecosystem; coastal co mmunities with rocky intertidal zones accessible by road are especially hard h it by beach foragers, algae gatherers and school educational groups during low tide periods. Capelin, Pacific sand lance, and Pacific sandfish have been and could again be considered for a possible commercial fisher y in Alaska, and the potential effects to these populations from fishing are unknow n; future fisheries would need to be regulated in a way that incorporates ecosystem considerations, such as considering predator needs in quota decisions. Conservation actions : a) Develop approaches to mitigate adverse impacts from beach foragers and educational groups to beaches, road-acces sible rocky intertidal zones, and rocky reef habitats used by rockfish juveniles (regulati ons, enforcement, coastal zone planning, beach preserve designations). b) Develop standards for managing vessel ba llast water to avoid introduction of nonindigenous species (see state's Invasive Species plan for overlapping strategies that would benefit forage fish). c) If fisheries are begun on capelin, Paci fic sand lance, or Pacific sandfish, ensure that harvest regulations are ba sed on broader ecosystem considerations such as predator needs. H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats Within the next 2 years, state and federal agencies in coordination with appropriate partners (e.g., universities, NGOs, tribal gove rnments, village councils) to develop an annual monitoring plan with evaluation at 5-year intervals; see objectives above.

Distribution and abundance Range : Global range comments: Circumpolar (Arctic cod); North Pacific (myctophids, prowfish) State range comments : Coastal glacial fjords and sh elf edge (myctophids); broadly distributed (prowfish); associated with jellyfish aggregations as j uveniles (Arctic cod; possible associations for myctophids, prowfish); North Be ring, Chukchi and Beaufort Seas (Arctic cod) Abundance : Global abundance comments : Unknown State abundance comments : Unknown (myctophids, prowfish, Arctic cod); Myctophids may dominate local assemblage by biomass; in the Beaufort Sea region, Arctic cod are locally the mo st abundant marine species; occurrence of any or all 3 species may represent a healthy marine eco system; prowfish are commonly caught in the juvenile fish assemblage near shore. Trends : Unknown Global trends : Arctic cod trends in the North Atla ntic are better understood than those in the North Bering, Chukchi, Beaufort, and Bering Seas; trends in the Chukchi and Bering Seas are variable and genera lly related to recruitment events. State trends : Unknown for all 304 Appendix 4, Page 83 References: Abookire et al. (2002); Alaska Sea Grant College (1997); Bradstreet and Cross (1982); Mecklenburg et al. (2002); Roseneau and He rter (1984); Springer et al. (1984) C . Problems, issues, or concerns for species group These are key species that play a critical role locally at local sites in Alaska's marine ecosystems; in glacial fjords, myctophids are a critical food source for many species; in the Arctic, Arctic cod play a critical role in the marine ecosystem and for human consumption. These species are susceptible to subtidal pollution (all 3 species) and, for Arctic cod, waste products from offshore drilling. These species are susceptible to climate change in regards to changes in sea ice (Arctic cod) and glac ial ice (myctophids). Whatever may adversely affect jellyfish ( Cyanea and Chrysaora) in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas may in turn have a detrimental effect on Boreogadus . In general, recovery time for Arctic and/or ice-dependent species and their habitats may be much longer than in more temperate climates; however, a population rebound could be very rapid in the Arctic for a species such as cod (B. Wilson, personal communication). Effective oil spill cleanup in ice-affected waters is still unproven. The presence of ice, affinity to ice stru cture (for Arctic c od, myctophids), and/or shallow water distribution make(s) sta ndard acoustic survey and some net sampling techniques difficult. A lack of harvest data (Arctic cod) exis ts and potential impacts of harvest on the population are unknown. Very little is known about distribution, abundance, life history, and habitat use and requirements. D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas For all, habitat requireme nts are largely unknown. Prowfish may need living cover (e.g., jellyfish aggregations) for rearing (i.e., refuge from surface feeders); juvenile Arctic cod may require jellyf ish aggregations when ice cover is limited. In general, status and condition of these habitats is unknown. References: Alaska Sea Grant College Program ( 1997); Brodeur et al (1999); Purcell et al. (2000) E. Concerns associated with key habitats See Section C, above Concentration of pollutants from anthr opogenic sources (e.g., in the Arctic for Arctic cod) Pollution (including increased ship traffic, cruise ship dumping and offshore oil development) Spilled pollutant (e.g. oil tr ansport, toxic plume) pathways parallel the food pathway for these species; mechanisms that produce important spawning and rearing habitats may be the same mechanisms that transport oil spills to them 305 Appendix 4, Page 84 Climate change; change in storm patterns , sea level rises and change in sea ice distribution Interaction with exotic species (e.g., ne w predators, disease, parasites) Dredge and fill (Arctic cod) F. Goal: Conserve and manage nearshore pelagi c forage fish populations to ensure sustainable use of these resources. G . Conservation objectives and actions Objective A : Maintain populations of the indicated nearshore pelagic forage fish species t their current levels. a Target: Level trend in annual abundance variation from the mean of each sampled species as measured over a 10-year cycle. Measure: Trend analysis of abundance in nearshore pelagic forage fish species, using annual measurements over a 10-year cycle, based on information from the baseline survey sites. Objective B : Maintain the quality and quantity of coastal habitat resources needed to sustain nearshore pelagic forage fish populations at their current levels. Target: 100% of the very good-to-pristine c ondition habitat required to maintain viable populations of each forage fish stock. Measure (1) : Establish habitat requiremen ts for species (e.g., salinity, temperature, prey) and produce a baseline map of available habitats used by nearshore-occurring pelagic forage fi sh against which to compare future monitoring results. Measure (2) : Trend analysis of the amount and quality of habitat, using annual measurements over a 10-year cycle, based on information from the baseline survey sites. For myctophids and Arctic cod this would focus first on defining optimal habitat conditions (oceanographic conditions that produce optimal plankton and food resources), then conn ecting these conditions to the forcing factors such as storm frequency, water te mperature, salinity and timing/frequency of water stratification; fo r adult prowfish, it would focus on rocky, bouldery areas with cover. (Issues and conservation actions below apply to one or both objectives.) Issue 1 : There is a lack of harvest data for Arctic cod, and potential impacts on the population from harvest are unknown. Conservation action: Develop and conduct harvest assessment for Arctic cod. Issue 2: There is a paucity of information about nearshore-occurring pelagic forage fish species and their habitats, and a lack of commitment to long-term monitoring. Very little is known about nearshore-occu rring pelagic forage fish distribution, abundance, life history, and habitat requirements/use. With some notable exceptions (e.g., industry-sponsored work in the nearshore Beaufort Sea, near Prudhoe Bay), little documented baseline exists against which to compare future population or habitat monitoring results. 306 Appendix 4, Page 85 There is limited information available on how habitats change naturally over time; it is difficult to separate anthropogeni c from natural (climate, uplift, etc.) variability in loss/degradation/gain of habitats. Sources of \"traditional knowledge\" about forage fish abundance and habitat use have not been determined. Conservation actions: a) Establish a network of monitoring sites. b) Determine minimum number of site s needed for statewide index. c) If there's extensive overlap among site s recommended by the different expert groups, consider putting together an LTER proposal at a designated site. d) Annually survey forage fish populati ons by conducting recruitment surveys via net sampling techniques and acoustic s at index locations around the coast, and report decadal trends in the sc ientific and popular literature. e) Determine the ecosystem function at the specific monitoring sites through collaboration with other agency proj ects (e.g., salmon, halibut, seabird, marine mammal diet surveys).

Little public knowledge about forage fi sh distribution, abundance, life history, and habitat (especially among those not tr aditionally using or observing forage fish species). Lack of public understanding of the importance of forage fish and forage fish habitat in the ecosystem.

Issue 4: Policies for sustaining forage fish stocks and their hab itats is lacking. Arctic cod harvest could become an issue; it may need to be regulated in a way that incorporates ecosystem considerati ons such as predator needs in quota decisions. Conservation actions : a) Develop approaches to mitigate adverse anthropogenic impacts to nearshore waters (regulations, enforcement, coastal zone planning). b) Develop standards for shipping regard ing pollution, docking facilities, and transport/introduction of nonindigenous sp ecies (see state's Invasive Species Plan for overlapping strategies th at would benefit forage fish).

Many are important for subsisten ce. Recreational and commercial fishing for many species, such as Arctic char, pike, rai nbow trout, Dolly Varde n, sheefish, and the 5 species of Pacific salmon, account for milli ons of dollars in commerce annually in Alaska. However, Alaska's \"nongam e\" fish species\u2014species that are not recreationally or commercially harvested\u2014play a crucia l role in aquatic ecosystems and, through predation by terrestrial, avian, and marine species, in other ecosystems as well. Some freshwater fish species constitute an importa nt element of the food chain for many other species including species of potential conservation concern, such as loons and beluga whales. In April 2004, ADF&G convened a diverse grou p of freshwater fish experts and asked these scientists to develop a short list of species and/or sp ecies groups to feature in the CWCS, including specific conservation actions th at could be started in the next decade. The group reviewed a complete li st of freshwater and anadro mous candidate species that excluded species routinely harvested in spor t or commercial fisheries in Alaska. By mutual agreement, the group then exclude d species (e.g., sturgeon) that occur only incidentally in Alaska. The experts compar ed the status of the remaining 25 species against 15 criteria; these included the 11 \"speci es selection criteri a\" listed in Section II(D), plus other criteria the group genera ted, including whether a species is used by humans, is important prey for another \"at-risk\" species, or is of demonstrated special scientific importance. Based on these criteria and the limited time available at the meeting, the group elected to prepare templates on 8 featured species or species groups: lampreys stickleback (Cook Inlet radiation). Conservation actions designed to protect the fish species and habitats shown on the following templates will likely benefit not only the human users of these species, but also the populati ons of game fish species inhabiting the same lakes and drainages. Failure of a species to be selected through this process as a featured species does not mean a species is unimportant or not in need of further study. For example, round whitefish, longnose sucker, slimy sculpin and ninespine stickleback are widely distributed in Alaska and common, while pric kly sculpin and coastrange sculpin have a more restricted distribution; all have been virtually unstudi ed. Lake chub has a restricted distribution in Alaska but populations are contiguous with other North American populations; it is an abundant and important forage species but unstudied in Alaska. The remaining whitefish species are all very impor tant because of human use for subsistence. The USFWS Office of Subsistence Mana gement has recently funded studies on whitefish, but genetic and taxonomic studies, particularly of the humpback whitefish species complex, remain to be addressed. 311 Appendix 4, Page 90 There are huge data gaps regarding life hi story, abundance, and trophic structure for all these species. Overall they ar e poorly understood, esp ecially in terms of Western science. However, the ecological role they perform is undoubtedly very important in aquatic, and for anadromous species, estuarine and marine ecosystems. In June 2005, the ADF&G Sport Fish Division, with partial funding from SWG monies developed an Alaska freshwater fish community and habitat data base with interactiv e mapping capabilities. This database is located at http://www.sf.adfg.state.ak.us/statewide/SF_home.cfm and includes the list of freshwater species found in Alaska, maps indicating where species have been collected or observed, and a link to general biological information on species. These data do not represent exhaustive i nventories, but are co mpilations of existing knowledge from field biologists that are upda ted periodically as knowledge improves. 312 Appendix 4, Page 91 Lampreys A. Species group description Common names: l ampreys (often colloquially/locally re ferred to as \"eels\" in Alaska and elsewhere) Scientific names: Pacific lamprey - ); Lentheron camtschatica and abundance Range: Global Range Comments: Poorly known, particularly in and across northerly areas/countries Pacific lamprey: Eastern Pacific drainage s from very northern Mexico to Alaska, across the Aleutian Island chain into the western Pacific and north to Hokkaido, Japan western brook lamprey: Eastern Pacific fr om the Sacramento River in California to just north of Juneau, Alaska river lamprey: Eastern Pacific from California to southeastern Alaska Arctic lamprey: Bering Sea and Arctic dr ainages to Anderson River (Canada) and south to Japan/Korea Alaskan brook lamprey: Range is considered the same as for Arctic lamprey, but perhaps most often with a more inland ra nge; this species in particular is not consistently recognized or understood. State Range Comments : Distributions and relationship s very poorly known in Alaska Pacific lamprey: Pacific drai nages up to at least the Bering Sea with records into lower Yukon/Kuskokwim western brook lamprey: southern Southeas t Alaska north to approximately 20 mi north of Juneau, Alaska river lamprey: Southeastern Alaska nort h to approximately Tee Harbor, Alaska 313 Appendix 4, Page 92 Arctic lamprey: Bering Sea and Arctic dr ainages, and possibly into northern north Pacific river basins Alaskan brook lamprey: Range considered same as for Arctic lamprey, but perhaps most often with a more inland range Abundance: Global abundance comments : Serious conservation concern throughout ranges State abundance comments : Unknown, but often found in Alaska with some local abundance Trends: Global trends : Declining across ranges outside of Alaska in North America and globally State trends : Unknown References : Beamish and Northcote 1989; Klamat h-Siskiyou Wildlands 1998; Ma itland 2003; Mecklenburg et al. 2002; Weeks 1991 C. Problems, issues, or concerns for species group There is a paucity of information about la mprey species in Alas ka and their habitats . We lack much basic information on such t opics as abundance, age structure, diet, trophic ecology, homing/migration, species identification, range, instream flow/water volume al. 1990). The systematics of Alaska's diverse la mprey species is difficult to determine. a) Lamprey species can be hard to identi fy, especially in juvenile stages (McPhail and Carveth 1994). b) Systematics of lamprey is very in complete and poorly understood; needs research and inventory. c) Lampreys are classically thought of as occurring in \"species pairs\" or \"satellite pairs\" (Mecklenburg et. al. 2002) parasitic (and anadromous) and its \"congener species\" nonparasitic derivative brook lamprey (nonparasitic) (Mecklenburg et. al. 2002) (Als o see \"distribution\" info) Arctic lamprey (parasitic) and Alaskan brook lamprey (nonparasitic) d) Populations that are isolated or with unusual life histories are described as distinct species elsewhere in the Pa cific (Docker et al. 1999; Appendix 4, Page 93 e) Lamprey diversity in Alaska is poorly documented and understood (McPhail and Lindsey 1970; Mo rrow 1980); although lampreys are usually listed as fish, ther e is currently some debate about it; their overall group is superclass Agnatha, class Cephalaspidormphi, order Petromyzontiformes. f) The taxonomic status of lamprey speci es is unresolved due to differing viewpoints on significance of life history types, and the complexities of relationships between speci es (Mecklenburg et al. 2002). Alaska likely has many populations with possibly rare or unique life-history characteristics. a) Confusing parasitic and non-parasitic \"paired species\" re lationships exist due to unresolved genetic analyses , and degenerative changes with maturation resulting in inconsistent taxonomic identification (McPhail and Lindsey 1970, Mecklenburg et. al. 2002; Morrow 1980). b) Non-parasitic freshwater forms are believed to have evolved from parasitic anadromous forms, but unusual \"intermediates,\" such as freshwater parasitic forms, exist. c) Geological isolates are not uncommon and are found in Alaska (Hastings and Haas 2002). Serious lamprey conservation/management issues exist elsewhere; extent and nature of issues to be expected in Alaska are unknown but may include: a) Lampreys are described as havi ng serious conservation concern throughout most of their na tural range (Renaud 1997). b) Lampreys (particularly Pacific lamprey) have been petitioned for listing as endangered species in the conti guous United States under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (Klamath-Siskiyou et al. 2003). c) There has been a collapse of Native subsistence and commercial fisheries outside of Alaska (e .g., Close et al. 2002). d) Lampreys are of considerable cu ltural and food importance for Native Americans (Close et al. 2002). e) Similar conservation/management/ex tinction issues are recognized elsewhere in the range (Beamish and Northcote 1992, Frissel 1993, Haas 1998, Kostow 2002). f) Lamprey are taken as a food fish in the lower Kuskokwim and Yukon Rivers and possibly elsewhere in Alaska. g) Subsistence harvest locations, levels, species, etc., are poorly documented or unknown. h) An emerging commercial fishery is possi ble in at least some regions, with unknown impacts. 315 Appendix 4, Page 94 i) Lampreys are possibly an important fora ge fish for species of conservation concern. j) Anadromous lampreys appear to have similar life history and habitat needs to salmonids; it is unknown whether factors causing decline of salmon stocks also cause declines in lamprey populations within the same drainages. D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Key or important habitat areas are la rgely undescribed and unknown in Alaska; lampreys may occur in other ha bitat types than listed here. While it is believed that adult lampreys have similar habitat/spawning needs as salmon (e.g., Vadas 2000), a 2003 Bristol Bay inventory found adult Alaskan brook lamprey in locations not occupied by salm on. Alaskan brook lamprey appear to have greater tolerance for streams with low grad ient, fine substrate, and low dissolved oxygen than do salmon (M. Wiedmer, pers. comm.). Rearing habitat for all juvenile lampreys (a mmocoetes) is different from that used by the adults. Juvenile lampreys prefer slow -flow freshwater area s/sloughs with silt/mud bottoms (Sugiyama and Goto 2002). In the 2003 Bristol Bay inventory mentioned above, juvenile lamprey were often found in headwater habitats, if suitable habitat (soft bottoms) was available (M. Wiedmer, pers. comm.). Resident nonparasitic lampreys use freshwater habitat for their entire life cycle; their ammocoetes only mature into adults for reproduction. Resident parasitic lampreys mature into adults, and feed as adults, in fresh water; some may spawn in lakes. E. Concerns associated with key habitats Lampreys seem to have similar habitat requirements as salmon (e.g., Vadas 2000); concerns for habitat destruction and degrad ation include effects originating instream (channelization, instream flow/water vol ume alteration, temperature, impoundment, passage, sedimentation) and those influences originati ng from outside the stream (pollution, riparian zone loss, ocean [o r lake] conditions, and climate change). F. Goal: Conserve and manage populations of Alaska lamprey species throughout their natural range to ensure sustainable use of these resources. G. Conservation objectives and actions Objective : Maintain species distribution, popul ation abundance, and life history variability indicative of vi able lamprey species comp lexes throughout their native habitats in Alaska. Target: Identify the distribution of lamprey species in Alaska. Measure: Document lamprey distribution w ithin Alaska as determined by literature review and surveys for a mmocoetes in potential habitat. Target: Lamprey ammocoetes are present in at least 90% of identified index areas. Measure: Presence of lamprey ammocoetes in index areas (to be determined). 316 Appendix 4, Page 95 Target: Density of ammocoetes is within na tural variability in at least 90% of selected lamprey rearing areas. Measure: Density of ammocoetes annually over a 10-year period in selected index areas. Issue 1 : Identification of species is difficult. Conservation action: Develop criteria and an appr oach for identification of ammocoetes and adult lampreys. Issue 2 : Unknown distribution of lamprey. Conservation actions: a) Document the freshwater distribution of the various species of lampreys in Alaska by sampling for ammocoetes and adults in a represen tative selection of drainages. b) Develop sampling protocols and im plement sampling schedule across geographic range in Alaska. c) Identify representative index areas. d) Identify and describe the habitat type s or categories used by various species and their life forms (e.g., as used in ADF&G's freshwater fish inventory database); develop and conduct sampling in rearing areas for ammocoetes to document distribution. e) Develop sampling techniques and docu ment the migration and movement patterns of different species and life stages. f) Develop a network of biologi sts/organizations to esta blish unified protocols, share data, leverage sampling effort s, and provide voucher specimens to museums (UAF, etc.). AFS-Alaska Chap ter might be a venue for organizing and consolidating information. Issue 3 : Habitat alteration, sufficient instream flow/water volume, fish passage, and sedimentation are potential concerns. Conservation actions: a) Determine instream flow/water volume needs and habitat requirements for all life history phases of lampreys. b) Consider lamprey species when there ar e issues of fish passage and habitat alteration (e.g., water diversions, dams, timber harvest, mining, sedimentation). c) Develop a coordinated effort among government and nongovernment agencies to coalesce and exchange information on the habitat and instream flow/water volume needs of lampreys. 317 Appendix 4, Page 96 Issue 4 : Lampreys are taken as a food fish (e.g., lower Yukon/Kuskokwim, possibly other areas); harvest le vels are not monitored. Conservation actions : a) Obtain local information and knowledge on local lamprey distribution, relative abundance, and harvest. b) Develop sampling protocol to monitor locations, timing, magnitude, and catch per unit effort (cpue) of harvest. c) Involve communities in monitoring, and share information. d) Train local communities to monitor abundance and harvest effort. Issue 5: Emerging commercial fishery for lampre y on the Yukon River with a lack of assessment. Conservation action: Document the number and magnitude of the commercial fisheries for lampreys that are occurring in the state; collect biological samples of lampreys (e.g., size, sex ratio, and if possible, species, age structure). Issue 6: Lampreys may be important forage fish for various freshwater and marine predators, some of which have been identifie d in this Strategy as of conservation concern. Conservation action: Determine the trophic ecology of lampreys. H. Plan and time frames for monito ring species and their habitats Promote coordination with state agencies, federal agencies, universities, industry, Native entities, and NGOs to conduct monitoring every year for 10 years to establish the target indices. Wherever possible, make us e of any existing fisheries to collect data and information. The University of Alaska Fairbanks, Museum of the North is interested in coordinating and undertaking inventory and research in general for nongame (and game) fish in Alaska. The Museum of the North would provi de expertise, training, and resources for proper collections, as well as storage in perpetuity and curation. ADF&G's ongoing statewide fish inventory progr am should coordinate with th e Museum of the North to ensure proper preparation and submittal of voucher specimens for curation. I. Recommended time frame for reviewing species status and trends Review within 5 years, and then at such frequency in th e future to ensure progress. J. Bibliography Beamish, R.J. 1987.

Distribution and abundance Range : Global range comments : Full extent unknown, but populations of some species occur in British Columbia, northwestern and northeastern United States (with introductions in Great Lakes areas), and northwestern Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea (Korea, Japan, Russia) 320 Appendix 4, Page 99 State range comments : Longfin smelt: Shelikof Strait, southwestern Gulf of Alaska, through Southeast. Rainbow smelt: entire coast of Alaska, but less common along Gulf of Alaska. Eulachon: Southwestern Alaska, Aleutians, Southcentral Alaska through Southeast Alaska. Abundance : Global abundance comments : Unknown State abundance comments : Unknown Trends : Global trends : Declining trends for anadromous smelt species across parts of their range State trends : Unknown References: McPhail and Lindsey 1970; M ecklenburg et al. 2002; Morrow 1980 C. Problems, issues, or concerns for species group Anadromous smelt species are an important forage fish for various marine predators, some of which have been iden tified in this Strate gy as of conservation concern (e.g., Cook Inlet beluga whales). (See the Marine Fish template called \"Forage Fish Occurring in Intertidal/Shallow Subtidal Areas.\") Alaskan populations of anadromous smelt species are poorly documented. There is a lack of information on these species, including life history, abundance, trophic ecology and instream fl ow/water volume needs. They are taken as a human food fish throughout their range. Threats exist to freshwater and es tuarine habitat and fish passage. There is a high interannual variability in populations suggested by saltwater trawl surveys. D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas For all 3 species: Lower reaches of stream s and rivers and associated estuaries (e.g., Susitna River); also, eula chon are known to ascend > 100 km up the Susitna (Yentna) system and rainbow smelt to enter Lower Ugas hik Lake, likely spawni ng in tributaries (M. Wiedmer, pers. comm.). Significan t eulachon runs also occur in the Kenai, Twenty-mile, and Eyak Rivers. On the North Slope, rearing also occurs in connected lakes in river deltas Habitat condition overall is thought to be very good to pristine Marine habitat and ecologi cal conditions are unknown E. Concerns associated with key habitats Potential impacts of water diversion or impoundment on movements, spawning and rearing habitats, and survival Nearshore chronic and acute pollution (suc h as oil spills, wastewater effluent) Broad-scale climate shifts aff ecting marine ecological conditions 321 Appendix 4, Page 100 F. Goal: Conserve and manage populations of Alaska anadromous smelt species throughout their natural range to ensure sustainable use of these resources. G. Conservation objectives and actions Objective : Maintain species distribution and population abundan ce within natural variation throughout their distributions in Alaska. Target: Identify the distributi on of anadromous smelt species in Alaska. Measure: Anadromous smelt distribution w ithin Alaska as determined by literature review and surveys at river m ouths to the limits of upstream spawning habitat. Target: Anadromous smelt species are within their natural variability of abundance in at least 90% of id entified index areas. Measure: Abundance of anadromous smelt species annually over a 10-year period in identified index areas. Issue 1: Anadromous smelt species are important prey for predators of conservation concern (e.g., beluga whales, loons). Conservation action: Work with marine scientists (e.g., marine mammal biologists, waterbird and seabird biologists) and Native harvesters to document the significance of anadromous smelt species in the diet of target species. Determine the trophic ecology of anadromous smelt species. Issue 2 : Lack of information on this species : life history (e.g., iteroparity vs. semelparity), population structure, migrati on patterns, distributi on, trophic ecology, and habitat needs/use. Conservation actions : a) Develop sampling and indexing protocol s and implement sampling schedule across geographic range. b) Identify representative index areas. c) Identify the habitat types or categorie s used by anadromous smelts (e.g., as used in ADF&G's freshwater fish inventory database). d) Develop sampling techniques and docu ment the migration and movement patterns of different species and life stages. e) Map current distribution and other similar habitats for future investigation. f) Develop a network of biologi sts/organizations to esta blish unified protocols, share data, leverage sampling effort s, and provide voucher specimens to museums (UAF, etc.). AFS-Alaska Chap ter might be a venue for organizing and consolidating information. Issue 3: Habitat alteration, sufficient instream flow/water volume, fish passage, and water quality are potential concerns. 322 Appendix 4, Page 101 Conservation actions: a) Determine instream flow/water volume needs and habitat requirements for all life history phases of smelts. b) Consider these smelt species when there are issues of fish passage and habitat alteration (e.g., water diversions, dams, timber harvest, mining, sedimentation). c) Develop a coordinated effort among government and nongovernment agencies to coalesce and exchange information on the habitat and instream flow/water volume needs of these smelts. Issue 4: Anadromous smelt species are taken as a food fish; harvest levels are not monitored for all species in all locations. Conservation actions : a) Obtain local information and knowledge on local anadromous smelt distribution, relative abundance, and harvest. b) Develop sampling protocol to monitor locations, timing, magnitude, and level of harvest. c) Collect biological samples (e.g., size, se x ratio and species, age structure). d) Involve communities in monitoring, and share information. e) Train local communities to monitor abundance and harvest effort. H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats Promote coordination with state agencies, fede ral agencies, universities, Native entities, and NGOs to conduct monitoring every year for 10 years to establish the target indices.

Species description Common name: Bering cisco Scientific name: Coregonus laurettae B. Distribution and abundance Spawning populations are known to be in the Yukon, Kuskokwim, and Susitna river drainages. All Bering ciscos are consider ed anadromous, and no subadult fish have been documented in fresh water. In the Y ukon River, spawning migrations extend at least 1700 km upstream, into the upper region of the Yukon Flats; the farthest upstream record is from Dawson City in Yukon Te rritory, over 2000 km from the sea. Marine distribution in the Bering Sea extends from Bristol Bay to Kotzebue Sound, and some individuals have been iden tified across the Beaufort S ea coast to Prudhoe Bay. Bering cisco have been reported from nearshore wate rs of the Chukotsk Peninsula, north of the Bering Straight, but these were probably migrants from Alaska, as no spawning populations have been reported from Asia. Th e marine distribution of the Susitna River population is unknown, but presumably they range throughout Cook Inlet waters and perhaps even farther. Abundance of the 3 identified Bering cisco populations are unknown, but Bering cisco are not rare where they are found. Range : Global range comments : Spawning populations known to be in Yukon, Kuskokwim, and Susitna Rivers; marine distribution includes Bering, C hukchi, and Beaufort Seas, and Cook Inlet State range comments : same as previous Abundance : Global abundance comments : Bering cisco essentially endemic to Alaska State abundance comments : Unknown Trends : Global trends : Unknown State trends: Unknown References: ADF&G 1985; DeGraaf 1981 C. Problems, issues, or concerns for species Lack of information on spawning area locations in the Kuskokwim and Yukon Rivers; spawning populations are not known elsewhere in Alaska In freshwater systems, fisheries bycatch of returning spawners in the salmon fishery in summer/fall (Yukon/Kuskokw im Rivers) in the fish wheels Localized human harvest (very abundant in river and coastal regions: potential for fishery development though not currently exploited) 324 Appendix 4, Page 103 Spawning areas very confined/localized a nd thus vulnerable to localized habitat disturbance (true for Susitna River popul ation; situation unknown for Kuskokwim and Yukon Rivers) Major ecological changes in the Beri ng Sea could impact population levels D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Only known to spawn in 3 large rive r systems in Alaska\u2014Yukon, Kuskokwim, Susitna Freshwater phase(s): egg development, to have highly confined/localized spawning areas; sp ring increase in flow triggers egg hatch in early spring and subseque nt flush of larvae to salt water Marine phase: coastal/nearshore environment from Bris tol Bay to Pt. Barrow, and Cook Inlet; also present (but rare) in nearshore Beaufort Sea at least as far east as Prudhoe Bay region. Males live in coastal environment 5-7 years, females 6-9 years Condition of coastal areas in Alaska salt water : very good to pristine Condition of large freshwater river systems : very good to pristine E. Concerns associated with key each habitats Water diversion or impoundment could imp act movements toward spawning and other habitats (low probability). F. Goal: Conserve and manage populations of Bering ci sco throughout their natural range to ensure sustainabl e use of these resources. G. Conservation objectives and actions Objective : Maintain current spawning distri bution and abundance within natural variation of Bering cisc o populations in Alaska. Target: Current level of abundance within natural variation. Measure: Use cpue as determined by random fish wheel or gillnet sampling or other means on the Yukon, Kuskokwim, and Susitna Rivers as abundance index. Target : 100% of known spawning lo cations/areas identified. Measure: Presence of spawning Bering cisco on known spawning locations in spawning season (September/October). Issue 1 : Lack of information on spawning area locations in the Kuskokwim, and Yukon Rivers. Conservation action: Document the spawning distribution, e.g., by using radio telemetry. Issue 2: Localized human harvest as bycatch in salmon fisheries and no monitoring of the catch is occurring; potential for fishery de velopment, though not currently exploited. 325 Appendix 4, Page 104 Conservation actions : a) Establish a system for estimating to tal harvest by randomly sampling fish wheel harvest on the Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers; use cpue as an index of abundance for Bering cisco. b) Estimate the size of Bering cisco stocks in Alaska using mark-recapture methods to evaluate the impact of by catch and potential development of commercial fisheries. c) Obtain local information and knowledge on Bering cisco distribution, relative abundance, age structure of the population, and harvest. d) Develop sampling protocol to monitor locations, timing, magnitude and cpue of harvest. e) Involve communities by training local individuals to monitor abundance and harvest, and by sharing informa tion with affected villages.

Broad Whitefish A. Species description Common name: broad whitefish Scientific name: Coregonus nasus B. Distribution and abundance Broad whitefish are widely distributed in Alaska fresh water from the Kuskokwim River drainage north to the Beaufort Sea drainages of the North Slope. Diadromous individuals frequent brackish water estuar ies throughout their range , but they are not thought to venture far out to sea. Freshwater resident individuals are present in some systems. Broad whitefish are also widely distributed along the northern coasts of Canada and Russia. In Alaska, few spawning areas have been identified. Known spawning areas are in the lower reaches of large rivers, but upstream from the influence of marine water. In northern Alaska, full maturity is reached by age 12. This species uses lakes connected to river systems as major feeding areas, sometimes remaining in lakes until maturity. Abundances of broad whitefish populations are unknown, but broad whitefish are generally not rare where they are found. Range : Global range comments : Northern regions of Asia and North America State range comments : Widely distributed in bracki sh and fresh water from the Kuskokwim River drainage north and east to the Beaufort Sea coastal region and the Canadian border Abundance : Global abundance comments : Unknown State abundance comments : Unknown 327 Appendix 4, Page 106 Trends : Global trends : Unknown State trends : Unknown References: Alt 1976; Bendock and Burr 1984, 1985; Berg and Erickson 1985; Fechhelm et al. et and Bond 1988; Tallman and Reist 1997 C. Problems, issues, or concerns for species Spawning areas have not been located in many systems. Instream flow/water volume need s for broad whitefish are unknown. In freshwater systems, a limited amount of fisheries bycatch of spawners occurs in the salmon fisheries in summer and fall (Yukon River particularly); no monitoring of bycatch is o ccurring and population effects, if any, of bycatch are unknown. Localized human harvest (abundant in river and coastal regions, actively sought in food fisheries; a preferred fish for subsis tence users along the Ar ctic Coastal Plain and an important fresh food source during the spring and fall in the Lower Kuskokwim and lower Yukon Rivers); no m onitoring of the catch or bycatch is occurring. Major ecological changes in marine waters could impact population levels. D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Spawning, egg development, and emergen ce are thought to occur in localized areas; spring increase in flow triggers egg hatch in early spring with subsequent larvae flush to lower drainage habitats and to estuaries. Freshwater feeding occurs in widely dispersed lentic and lotic habitats. Coastal environments and lakes connected to rivers or coastal regions are utilized throughout the species' range. Overwintering in Beaufort Sea drainages in Alaska occurs in deep pools in lower reaches; elsewhere in Alaska, overwintering habitats are poorly understood. Summer feeding in nearshore waters of th e Beaufort Sea in/near deltas of larger rivers. Condition of saltwater coastal areas in Alaska : very good to pristine Condition of large freshwater river systems : very good to pristine E. Concerns associated with each habitat Instream flow/water volume alteration, water diversion, or impoundment could impact movements toward sp awning and other habitats. Mining in spawning habitats c ould impact entire populations. Drier climatic trends, an increase of beavers noted through local traditional knowledge, and reduced or altered instr eam flows/water volume in Interior Alaska may cause reduced access to off-channel feeding habitats. 328 Appendix 4, Page 107 F. Goal: Conserve and manage broad whitefish populations throughout their natural range to ensure sustainabl e use of these resources. G. Conservation objectives and actions Objective : Maintain current spawning distri bution and abundance within natural variation of broad whitefi sh populations in Alaska Target: Current level of abundance within natural variation Measure: Use cpue and age distribution as determined by random fish wheel sampling on the Yukon River, fish wheel or gillnet sampling on the Kuskokwim River, and standardized net sampling in a selection of other drainages as abundance indices Target: 100% documentation of drainages known to support spawning populations Measure: Number of drainages surveyed and mapped for presence of broad whitefish spawners in known or likely spawning drainages during late fall season (September/October) Issue 1 : Lack of information on spawning area locations throughout the state Conservation action: Document the spawning distri bution using radiotelemetry. Issue 2 : Localized human harvest an d bycatch in salmon fisheries is large in places; no monitoring of the catch or bycatch is occurring; commercial harvest has occurred in the past; potential exists for additional commerci al fishery development in some locations. Conservation actions: a) Establish a system for estimating to tal harvest of select populations by randomly sampling regional harvests; us e cpue and age distribution as an index of abundance for monitoring large changes. b) Estimate the size of certain broad whitefish stocks in Alaska using mark-recapture methods to evaluate the impact of bycatch and potential development of commercial fisheries. c) Obtain local information and knowle dge on broad whitefish distribution, relative abundance, age structur e of the population, and harvest. d) Develop sampling protocol to monitor locations, timing, magnitude, and cpue of harvest. e) Involve communities by training local individuals to monitor abundance and harvest, and by sharing informa tion with affected villages Issue 3: Habitat alteration, sufficient instream flow/water volume, fish passage, and water quality are potential concerns. Conservation actions: a) Determine instream flow/water volume needs and habitat requirements for all life history phases of broad whitefish. 329 Appendix 4, Page 108 b) Consider broad whitefish when there ar e issues of fish passage and habitat alteration (e.g., water diversions, dams, timber harvest, mining, sedimentation). c) Develop a coordinated effort among government and nongovernment agencies to coalesce and exchange information on the habitat and instream flow/water volume needs of broad whitefish.

Stickleback (Cook Inlet radiation) Threespine stickleback and ninespine stickl eback are both species complexes with many unique and reproductively isolated \"species\" (i.e., populations or potential subspecies) throughout their range. The threes pine stickleback is a model species in the fields of evolutionary biology, developmental ge netics, animal behavior, ecology, and environmental toxicology. Although neither sp ecies complex is in danger of decline (stickleback are often the mo st abundant species in an area), many unique populations and \"species\" are in serious decline or already extinct (Foster et al. 2003). One of the most studied and remarkable threes pine stickleback radiations exists in the Cook Inlet watershed in Southcentral Alaska. Stickleback scientists have studied this radiation intensively for the past 20 years and a large database has been built, including detailed information for over 200 populati ons on body armor, morphometrics, life history, behavior, trophic ecology, parasitol ogy, and genetics. Populations in this radiation are now being used to study the ge netic and behavioral mechanisms of rapid evolution and speciation, lo ss of skeletal elements (which has human medical implications, for example, for osteopor osis), evolution of development and developmental abnormalities, behavioral ev olution, life history e volution, parasitism, genetic structure and function, and the eff ects of environmental contaminants. This database (and hence the populations under study) represents the most extensive stickleback database in the world, with importa nt contributions in all of these fields of study. The threespine stickleback genome is currently being sequenced. The individual fish selected for sequencing came from Bear Paw Lake in the Cook Inlet watershed (F. von Hippel, personal communica tion). Therefore the scient ific importance of these populations will increase greatly in the future. Additionally, a number of unique and important ninespine stickleback populations that have been st udied exist in the Cook Inlet watershed. In order to protect the scientif ic investment in these radiati ons and the future utility of these populations for ongoing scientific i nvestigations, unique populations from both 340 Appendix 4, Page 119 species complexes should be sustained. Many of these populations may be threatened by invasive northern pike ( Esox lucius ), human impacts on water quality, and salmonid stocking or introductions in is olated lakes (no inlet or out let streams). Lessons learned from the conservation of threespine and nine spine stickleback radiations in Alaska may be applied to the conservation of si milar radiations (e.g., Arctic char [Salvelinus alpinus ], [ Lampetra and Lenthenteron spp.]) when their phenotypic diversity becomes better understood. Additionally, sticklebacks play an important role in the food webs of lakes and streams; they are, for example, a major source of prey for fish-eating birds, including species of conservation concern (e.g., loons). A. Species group description Common name : threespine stickleback Scientific name: name: Pungitius pungitius B. Distribution and abundance Range : (Bell and Foster 1994) Global range comments: Threespine stickleback: Marine, brackish and fresh waters in the Northern Hemisphere along both coasts of the Pacific and Atla ntic Oceans, as well as in scattered populations along the Arctic Ocean and inland seas of Eur ope Ninespine stickleback: Marine, brackish and fresh wa ters throughout the hi gh latitude Holarctic State range comments : Threespine stickleback: Marine , brackish and fresh waters along the Gulf of Alaska, Bering Sea, and low-gradient rivers and lakes; a few populations occur on the North Slope Ninespine stickleback: Marine, brackish a nd fresh waters from the Kenai Peninsula and Mat-Su Valleys west along the Gulf of Alaska, as well as along the Bering Sea and North Slope Abundance : Global abundance comments : Both species complexes ar e abundant thro ugh most of their ranges. One potential sub-\"species\" in the threespine stickleback species complex (the \"unarmored threespine stic kleback\") is a U.S. federally listed endangered species (in southe rn California). A number of other populations/\"species\" are in serious decline or extinct in certain parts of their range; for example, all 3 remaining benthic-limnetic species pairs in Canada are now listed as endangered (introduced brown bullheads [ Ameiurus nebulosus] caused the extinction of the Hadley Lake species pair in the 1990s) , and numerous unique populations in North America, Europe, and Japan are now extinct or threatened (Foster et. al. 2003). State abundance comments : Abundant in lowland lakes and streams, as well as marine and brackish waters; some unique popul ations are in dec line within the Cook 341 Appendix 4, Page 120 Inlet watershed due to invasive northern pike, human impacts on water quality, and stocking of salmonids in isolated lakes (no inlet or outlet streams). Trends : Global trends : Still abundant in most of range, but an increasing number of unique populations in decline or extirpated in parts of Europe, North America and Asia (Foster et. al. 2003). State trends : Still abundant in most of Alaska, but an increasing number of unique populations or \"species\" that ar e in decline as part of th e Cook Inlet radiation are in decline in Southcentral Alaska due to inva sive northern pike, human impacts on water quality, and stocking or intr oduction of salmonids in is olated land-locked lakes (Patankar et al., in review). C. Problems, issues, or concerns for species group The conservation concerns are specifically for lakes and streams containing unique populations of threespine or ninespine st icklebacks in the Cook Inlet watershed. Lack of information on the lakes an d streams with unique populations Lack of information on the distribu tion/occurrence of unusual stickleback populations Predation by invasive nort hern pike may be leading to population declines and possible loss of unusual forms of the radiation (Patankar 2004) Human impacts on water quantity and quality Stocking or other introducti on of predatory fish species (e.g., salmonids) in lakes without inlet or outlet streams (isolated land-locked lakes), whether that stocking be an official program by ADF&G or in advertent or intentional introductions by the public Sticklebacks are not taken for comm ercial or recreational fisheries D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Key habitats are low-lying lakes and streams. Many of the unique populations exist in lakes without inlets/outle ts (and hence no native salmonids). Habitats are likely in near pristine co ndition except in developed areas of Southcentral Alaska. Unique populations of the C ook Inlet radiation that mer it conservation attention are known to exist in a number of lakes and streams throughout the Cook Inlet watershed. Authors of this template can provide a de tailed list of such lakes upon request. E. Concerns associated with key habitats Predation by invasive northern pike Human impacts on water quantity and quality Stocking or other introducti on of predatory fish species (e.g., salmonids) in lakes without inlet or outlet streams (isolated lake s), whether that stoc king be an official program by the ADF&G or inadvertent or intentional introduc tions by the public 342 Appendix 4, Page 121 F. Goal: Conserve and manage unique populations of the thr eespine stickleback radiation and the ninespine stickleback radiation in the Cook Inlet watershed throughout their natural range to ensure sustai nability of these resources. G. Conservation objectives and actions Objective : Maintain abundance within natural vari ability of threespine and ninespine stickleback populations in key lakes and streams (with unique populations) throughout the Cook Inlet watershed. Target: Abundance within the natural variabil ity for unique Cook Inlet populations. Measure: Abundance estimates (as determined by cpue, mark-recapture or other methods) in unique populations in the Cook Inlet watershed within the bounds of 10-year cycles as determined by literature review and surveys. Issue 1 : Lack of information on the abundance in dicative of viable populations for these lakes and streams with unique populations. Information for these lakes and streams is needed for life history, population structur e, migration patterns, distribution, trophic ecology, and habitat characterization (georeferenc ed). Some of this information is known for each lake and stream known to contain a unique population, but much data still need to be collected; missing information varies by lake/stream. Conservation actions : a) Develop sampling protocols and impl ement sampling schedule for these unique populations. b) Develop a network of stickleback biologists/organizations to establish unified protocols, share data, leverage sa mpling efforts, and provide voucher specimens to museums. Much of this network is already in place and simply needs to be formalized. Issue 2 : Lack of information on the distribut ion/occurrence of unusual stickleback populations. The Cook Inlet watershed contains nu merous lakes, and although well over 200 lakes have been sampled, many hundreds have not; some may contain unique and important stickleback populations. Unusual populations of threes pine and ninespine sticklebacks occur where conditions are unusua l (e.g., lakes with low ionic strength water and lacking inlet or outle t streams). It is not practical to sample every lake and stream in the Cook Inlet watershed, but it is importa nt to know where and how common these unusual populations are. Conservation action: a) Develop a series of proxies to identify candidate lakes for unusual stickleback populations, such as isolated lakes (especially with no outlet stream) as a proxy for evolutionary loss of body armo r, relative area above the euphotic zone depth as a proxy for trophic form, and deep steep-sided lakes as a proxy for limnetic or highly variable populati ons. Other proxies could be developed to rapidly identify potential unusual populat ions. This can lead to an efficient sampling strategy designed to locate and count unusual populations. One 343 Appendix 4, Page 122 criterion could be areas at risk (e.g., lakes that may experience or have experienced invasion by northern pike, la kes near towns or other types of developments, or lakes that might be stocked by ADF&G). b) As soon as possible, develop and impl ement a lake stocking policy designed to protect nongame species of unique scientific interest or of conservation concern, such as some stickleback popul ations in the Cook Inlet watershed. Issue 3 : Predation by invasive north ern pike in many of these lakes and streams may lead to declines in stickleback populations and may cause extinctions of populations (e.g., armor-reduced populations of threespine stickl eback, such as in Prator Lake); such predation could also quickly lead to major changes in th e phenotype of some populations (e.g., the evolution of more r obust body armor), reducing the scientific value of those populations (Patankar 2004) . Conservation actions : a) Develop a public education elemen t (e.g., curriculum for high school biology classes, poster at ADF&G offices) that provides information on the importance of Alaskan sticklebacks as model systems in scientific investigations. b) Implement strategies to rid key stickl eback lakes of invasive northern pike (e.g., unlimited fishing on northern pike , seining for northern pike, etc.); avoid use of poisons, which would also rid lakes of their unique stickleback populations. c) Implement strategies to prevent pike from invading additional lakes with unique stickleback populations. d) Conduct public education on the importa nce of pike elimination and the need to stop illegal introductions of pike. Issue 4 : Humans are impacting wa ter quantity and quality in many of these lakes and streams where unique stickleback reside (e .g., sedimentation, eutrophication, pollution, water withdrawal, etc.) due to road construction, housing development, mining, timber harvest practices, pollution from military installations, etc. Global climate change, the spruce bark beetle outbreak, and fire may also influence water quantity and quality. Conservation actions : a) Identify water quality problems in these lakes and streams and implement remedies. b) Take preventative measures to avoid se dimentation in thes e lakes and streams from road construction and logging operations. c) Ensure sufficient water quantity in lake s and streams where stickleback reside d) Develop additional remedies for known threats to water quality and reassess as needed. H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats Promote coordination with other state agencies , federal agencies, universities, industry, 344 Appendix 4, Page 123 Native entities, and NGOs to conduct monitoring every year for 10 years to establish the target abundance index for these unique populations.

These are the Western Toad (Bufo boreas ), Wood Only two of these species have been documented outside the so utheast regions of the state. The Wood Frog, which is the most hardy and widespread sp ecies of frog in North America, has been found from the mainland of Southeast Alaska northward to the Brooks Range. Alaska's single toad species, the Western Toad, ha s been recorded th roughout the southeast Panhandle and along the mainland coast to Prince William Sound. Many large islands in Southeast Alaska have never been surveyed for amphibians, and only rudimentary species range maps are av ailable for this region. Western Toad and Rough-skinned Newts are thought to be wide ly distributed throughout the mainland and islands of the Alexander Archipelago. Wood and Spotted Frog and Long-toed Salamander are reported chiefly in areas with transmontane river systems, such as the Taku and Stikine that connect Southeast Alaska to major portions of their distribution in Canada. Northwestern Salamanders are know n from only a handful of locations in Southeast Alaska. Southeast Alaska populat ions of all but Wood Frog are near the northern edges of their geographic ranges. In addition to these native species, two frogs from the Pacific Northwest have been introduced: Pacific Chorus Frog ( Pseudacris regilla ) and Red-legged Frog (Rana aurora). They apparently have viable but restricted populations in the Alexander Archipelago of Southeast Alaska on Revillagigedo Island and Chichagof Island. These populations are the result of unauthorized translocations from outside the state. Alaska's amphibians require ponds or other still water for breedi ng. But the ecology of small ponds, particularly those lacking connectio ns to fish streams, has received almost no scientific study. Effective conservation will require a better understanding of pond morphology, function, origin, and diversity. Populations of some amphibians have declined dramatically around the world in recent decades. A variety of possible causes have been cited, including habitat loss, increased UV-B radiation, fungal infection, intensified predation by introduced fish and nonnative frogs, climate change, increased risk of disease, damage to immune systems resulting from pollutants such as pesticides, and combinations of these factors. Amphibians are good indica tors of significant environmental changes. They are sensitive to environmental factors such as habitat destructio n and others listed a bove. Anecdotal reports from Ketchikan to Hain es point to a dramatic drop in numbers of Wester n Toad, a species with well-documented de clines outside of Alaska. Amphi bians in many parts of North America including some areas in Alaska have unusu ally high occurren ces of malformed limbs. In light of these gr owing amphibian conservation co ncerns and the importance of their habitats for other fish and wildlife spec ies, there is a need for basic information in Alaska. This will require an understanding of amphibian taxonom y, as well as the distribution, habitat need s, life history, curren t status, and population trends of specific species. 349Appendix 4, Page 128 A. Species group description: Six native amphibian species occur in Alaska. Common names : Northwestern Salamander, Long -toed Salamander, Rough-skinned Newt, Western Toad, Columb ia Spotted Frog, abundance Range : Global range comments : Northwestern Salamander - Pacific coast of North America from northern Southeast Alaska south through western Ca nada and northwestern United States to Gualala River, California. Sea level to about 10,200 ft (3110 m). Long-toed Salamander - Southeastern Alaska sout hward to Tuolumne County, California, east to Rocky Mountains (eas t-central British Columbia, west-central Alberta, western Montana, and central Id aho). Isolated populations in Santa Cruz and Monterey counties, Californi a. Sea level to about 10,000 ft. Rough-skinned Newt - Pacific coast from Southeast Alaska through western Canada (including Vancouver Island but not the Queen Charlotte Islands) to Santa Cruz County, California. Records from the Rocky Mountains, including 3 populations in Latah County, Idaho, in 1997. Sea level to about 9200 ft. Western Toad - Pacific Coast from Prince William Sound in Alaska to Baja California, east through the Rocky Mountains in west-central Alberta, Montana, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, and (formerly) northern New Mexico; absent from most of the desert Southwest. Sea level to at least 11,939 ft. Wood Frog - Widespread throughout northern No rth America and ranges farther north than any other American amphibian. Northern Alaska to Labrador, south to New Jersey, northern Georgia, and northern Idaho; spotty distribution south to northern Colorado in Rocky Mountains; also disjunct populations in Arkansas and Missouri. Columbia Spotted Frog - Southeast Alaska, southwestern Yukon, northern British Columbia, and western Alberta south th rough Washington east of the Cascades, eastern Oregon, Idaho, and western Mont ana. Disjunct populations found in Nevada, southwestern Idaho, Utah, a nd western and north-central Wyoming. Elevation range is from sea level to about 10,000 ft. State range comments : Northwestern Salamander - Found in coastal forests of Southeast Alaska. Collected in 2 localities only: southe ast of Ketchikan on Mary Island, and on northwest Chichagof Island near Pelican. A globular egg mass, presumably of this species, was found in Figure Eight Lake , Stikine River. Recently, a single northwestern salamander was reported from the outer coast of Glacier Bay National Park in Graves Harbor. 350Appendix 4, Page 129 Long-toed Salamander - Alaska distribution restricted to southeastern coastal forests adjacent to the Stikine and Ta ku River watersheds. Reported near the mouth of Stikine River at Figure Eigh t Lake (Twin Lakes), Mallard Slough, Cheliped Bay, Andrew Slough, Farm Island and Sokolof Island. Also collected on the Alaska side of the Coast Range in the Taku River Valley. Rough-skinned Newt - Found throughout Southeast Alas ka as far north as Juneau, and on the Alexander Archipelago on Ad miralty Island, Shelter Island, and on many islands south of Fredrick Sound. They have also been reported on Bamdoroshni Island, and more recentl y on Rockwell Island in Sitka Sound. Newts on mainland near Juneau and Bam doroshni and Rockwell islands may be the result of transplant s from Shelter Sound around 1980 and Ketchikan in the 1960s respectively. Unverified and questio nable reports from farther north along Gulf Coast and perhaps as far west as Cook Inlet. Western Toad - This species as the widest distribution of all amphibians in Southeast Alaska. Found in coastal rain forests on the mainland and islands throughout Southeast Alaska, northward along Gulf Coast to Prince William Sound (PWS). In PWS, they have been documented on Montague and Hawkins islands, on the mainland as far west as th e Columbia Glacier and as far north as the Tasnuna River, a tribut ary of the Copper River. Wood Frog - Widely distributed throughout Al aska and is the only amphibian found above the Arctic Circle. Documented on the mainland in Southeast Alaska, throughout Central Alaska to at least Anaktuvuk Pass w ith unverified reports farther north and east on the North Sl ope, westward to Kobuk River valley, southward to the base of the Alaska Peninsula, and the Kenai Peninsula. Apparently, absent from Prince William Sound, though reported near Valdez, and the Copper River basin (Anderson 2004). A localized population of wood frogs on Douglas Island near Juneau are suspected transplants. Columbia Spotted Frog - Present in coastal forest s of Southeast Alaska, although range limits are not precisely known. Pres ent distribution confined to coastal transboundary river corridors of contin ental mainland, such as Salmon, Taku, Stikine and Unuk Rivers and the Agassi z Peninsula. Have been documented on Mitkof, Sergief and Vank Islands within the adjacent Alexander Archipelago. Mitkof Island population (in and near the city of Wrangell) possibly introduced. Report in 2003 of frogs at one location al ong the Juneau road system suspected to be an introduction. Also reported but not confirmed in Haines area. Its regular presence on the Chilkoot Trail and within the White Pass areas lake system on the Canadian side of the border indicates high potential for the speci es to be found in nearby Alaska. Abundance : Global abundance comments : Northwestern Salamander - Total adult populati on size unknown but likely exceeds 10,000 and possibly exceeds 100,000. 351Appendix 4, Page 130 Long-toed Salamander - Total adult population size is unknown but expected to exceed 10,000. Rough-skinned Newt - Total adult population si ze unknown but likely exceeds 100,000. Western Toad - Total adult population size unknown but likely exceeds 100,000. Wood Frog - Total adult population unknown but is likely more than 1,000,000. Columbia Spotted Frog - Total adult population si ze unknown but surely exceeds 100,000. State abundance comments: Northwestern Salamander - Unknown, but suspected rare. Long-toed Salamander - Alaska population size unknown but considered relatively small. Waters (1992) surveyed the Stikine River Basin during summer 1991 and failed to observe this species. Rough-skinned Newt - The most common tailed amphi bian in Alaska; fairly common throughout Southeast Alaska. Western Toad - Overall population unknown. Form erly considered abundant and widespread in Southeast Alaska; more recently, reports of long-time residents from Haines to Ketchikan have noted sharp declines. Wood Frog - Wood frogs are the most common am phibian in Alaska. Apparently more abundant on the mainland than in Southeast. Columbia Spotted Frog - Current population size unknown. Trends: Global trends : Northwestern Salamander - Unknown. Long-toed Salamander - Unknown. Rough-skinned Newt - Likely stable in extent of occurrence and probably stable to slightly declining in population size, proportion of sites occupied and number/condition of occurrences. Western Toad - Rocky Mountain populations in Colorado and Wyoming have undergone a drastic decline since the 1970s. Declining in coastal southern British Columbia and questionable status in lo wer Pacific Northwest of United States. Has declined greatly in the Yosemite area of the Sierra Nevada, California, where surveys in 1915 and 1919 described them as \"exceedingly abundant.\" Apparently declining in Yellowstone National Pa rk, Montana, and locally elsewhere. Wood Frog - Population trend is unknown but probably stable to slightly declining. Columbia Spotted Frog - Relatively stable in most of the range, but populations in the arid southern portion of the range have declined. 352Appendix 4, Page 131 State trends : Northwestern Salamander - Unknown. Long-toed Salamander - Unknown. Rough-skinned Newt - Unknown. Western Toad - Formerly considered abundant and widespread in Southeast Alaska; more recently, reports of long-tim e residents from Haines to Ketchikan suggest declines. Wood Frog - Population trend is unknown but probably stable to slightly declining. Numerous reports from the Ke nai Peninsula, the Anchorage Bowl, and Talkeetna area that indicate wood frogs are no longer present at historical breeding sites. Columbia Spotted Frog - Unknown.

Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Northwestern Salamander - Eggs are laid in pon ds, lakes, and slow-moving streams; usually attached to vegetatio n in shallows. During the breeding season, they often are found under rocks and logs. In Alaska, known breeding sites include muskeg ponds and freshwater lake s that supply a permanent water source. 355Appendix 4, Page 134 This species may have an affinity for fo rested areas of glacial refugia. This species probably returns to its natal ponds for breeding. Long-toed Salamander - Found in a wide variety of habitats, including dry woodlands, humid forests, subalpine mead ows, and rocky shores of mountain lakes. Common elements appear to be we ll-drained areas with thick litter on the forest floor and close to relativel y permanent water bodies. Adults are subterranean except during the breeding season. Salamanders also were found in seral stages ranging from 3-year-old clearcuts to 180-year-old forests and occurred in active logging ar eas. Breeds in temporary or permanent ponds, or in quiet water at the edge of lakes and streams. During the breeding season adults may be found under logs, rocks, and other de bris near water. Eggs are attached to vegetation or loose on bottom. Rough-skinned Newt - Uses forested cover adjace nt to aquatic habitat for breeding and overwintering. Found in and about small permanent bodies of water (ponds, lakes, reservoirs, and slow-moving streams) with abundant vegetation. On Wrangell Island, species found using backwa ter lakes and muskegs. Lays eggs singly on aquatic plants or submerged twigs. Western Toad - Broad range of habitat use. Ca n be found from sea level to well up in the mountains. Primarily terrestrial, th ey enter water to breed in a variety of shallow ponds, lakes, streams, backwaters, ephemeral and sometimes brackish pools warmed by the sun. Hibernates in burro ws below frostline in forested cover up to several kilometers from aquatic hab itat. Tolerant of, and possibly prefers, young landscapes and disturbed areas near fore st cover, such as riverine oxbows, ponds recently created due to glaciation, and gravel extraction ponds for breeding. Wood Frog - This species is closely associated with Alaska's Interior forests. Inhabits a diversity of vegetation type s from grassy meadows to open forest, muskeg, and even tundra. Breeds in early spring in shallow bo dies of permanent or ephemeral water. Hibernates under the snow in shallow depressions of compacted forest litter. Columbia Spotted Frog - Highly aquatic. Closely associated with permanent water. Found predominantly in outwas h ponds and backwater lakes, beaver ponds, muskeg ponds, river channels, and streams. Emerges and breeds very early and in colder conditions compared to other species. E. Concerns associated with key habitats Climate change and warming (See fourth bullet in C above) a) Also affects water depth, temperature, and permanence of wetlands b) Expect changes in seral pa tterns and vegetation types. Habitat loss, fragmentation a nd degradation (See C above) Natural succession (See C above) 356Appendix 4, Page 135 F. Goal: Conserve and manage native amphibian populations, assemblages, and metapopulations throughout their natural range to ensure sustainable use of these resources. G. Conservation objectives and actions State conservation and management needs : Objective 1 : Maintain local amphibian distribut ions within natural variability. Target: Establish and maintain occupancy ra te (proportion of sites occupied) at baseline levels for native amphibians in selected areas within their ranges within 5 years. Measure: Occupancy rate for sele cted areas and species. Issue 1: Historical information is currently disp ersed and must be used to inform the development of occupancy-based protocols. Conservation actions: a) Synthesize existing published and un published data on amphibian locations. b) Initiate a Traditional Ecological Knowle dge project to collect and summarize anecdotal amphibian information from Native and other long-time residents. c) Assemble existing Alaska-based publicati ons (articles, final reports, etc.) in a centralized location and make it accessible for education/research. Issue 2: Occupancy-based protocols for monitori ng and supporting data systems are not in place for Alaska. Conservation actions: a) Develop a central, statewide amphibian database to track historical, contemporary, and future observations, genetic samples, voucher specimens, changes in occupancy, malformation locations, and temporal/spatial data gaps in real time. Develop quality control standards for inclusion of future data. b) Develop, promote, and initiate a stra tified, regional amphibian inventory project using shared protocols that al low data to be pooled and analyzed across jurisdictions (regionally/state wide). Protocols would include the preservation of scientific samples for future morphological, genetic, epidemiological and other studies, and ideal ly also be consistent with national efforts (i.e., USGS Amphibian Rese arch and Monitoring Initiative). c) Support a statewide \"Citizen Science\" e ffort to collect and validate public reports on amphibian distribution, thr eats, and other appropriate issues. Develop standards for credibility of reports. Issue 3: Many threats are hypothesized, but few ha ve been fully investigated and documented. Conservation action: Identify which potential threats or stressors may be influencing observed changes in occupancy in a gi ven area. Design futu re inventory and monitoring efforts to test the va lidity of these pot ential hypotheses. 357Appendix 4, Page 136 Issue 4: Native amphibians may be susceptibl e to declines due to known factors (introduced species, wetland loss) befo re all threats are fully understood. Conservation actions: a) Support implementation of the Alaska Amphibian Working Group to promote collaboration at regional, statew ide, and international levels. b) Promote development of outreach and edu cational information to inform state, federal, and tribal land management agen cies of the serious deleterious effects of the factors currently id entified as responsible for declines in occupancy. c) Limit habitat fragmentation through the use of buffer zones and around breeding habitats and planning road construction to protect connectivity of populations. d) Initiate active monitoring of known exotic amphibians in Southeast Alaska. Study feasibility of eradication methods. e) Promote development of outreach and e ducational information to inform the public and school teachers on the eff ects of introduced nonnative (store bought) amphibians into natural systems, the illegality and dangers of the collection of endemic amphibians as pets, and the harmful effects of reintroduction of endemic amphi bians collected as pets. Issue 5: Habitat destruction and degradation in key areas could threaten the sustainability of amphibian populations. Conservation actions: a) Identify specific locations that appear to be of particular importance for survival/productivity. b) Investigate and document the effect s of potential threats, including clearcutting and other lo gging practices, siltation, and fish introductions. c) Use plans, information on pending land exchanges, and personal interviews with local residents and land managers to assess potential threats to key local areas, including road bu ilding, settlement, development, logging, dumping fertilizer discharge, and fish introduction. d) Support the protection of any areas identified as being of key importance to any amphibian species from overt anthropogenic change. Objective 2 : Monitor and maintain low malforma tion rates for Alaska amphibians. Target: Maintain a malformation rate for Al askan amphibians that approaches the suggested natural background malformation rate of 3%. Measure: Rate of malformations of native amphibian species. Issue 1: The current statewide malformation rates are not currently documented. Conservation actions: a) Determine the statewide proportion of ma lformations due to simple trauma or injury and initiate statewide surveys of amphibian malformations and their types. b) Initiate/continue stat ewide surveys of amphibian ma lformations to determine if there are \"malformation hotspots.\" 358Appendix 4, Page 137 Issue 2: The proportional contributions of each of the potential causal agents to the malformation rate statewide are unknown. Conservation actions: a) Support laboratory research on the actua l effects of the various hypothetical causes for amphibian malformation. T horoughly test the na tural background rate for various populations a nd species across the state. b) Initiate studies to determine which po tential causes may be operating in different malformation hotspots. If no hotspots exist, initiate studies to determine which of the potential causes is likely the greatest contributor to malformation. Issue 3: The effects of malformations on population dynamics are unknown. Conservation action: Support field studies to determin e what level of malformations result in population losses. H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats State and federal agencies, universities, Na tive entities and NGOs should coordinate to establish a monitoring plan within the next 2 years that would begin bi-annual monitoring with evaluation at 5-year intervals.

Herpetol. 27:233-236. 367 Appendix 4, Page 146 Reptiles - Introduction Only 4 species of reptiles, all marine tu rtles representing 2 families, have been documented within the state's borders. Ma rine turtles are uncommon to casual visitors to Alaska's Gulf Coast waters (Wing 2004), and are c onsidered a natural part of the state's marine ecosystem. Ba sed on occurrences since 1960, Leatherback Seaturtles are considered uncommon (19 reports), Green Seaturtles are rare (15 reports), and Olive Ridley Seaturtles (3 reports) and Loggerhead Seaturtles (2 reports) are casual visitors to Alaska waters (Wing 2004; Wing and Hodge 2002). Currently, all 4 species are listed as threatened or endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Prior to 1993, marine turtle si ghtings were mostly of live Leatherback Seaturtles; since then, most observations have been of Green Seaturtle carcasses (Wing 2004). At present it is not possible to determine if this is re lated to changes in oc eanographic conditions or to changes in population size and distribution. Reports of Garter Snakes from the main land of Southeast Alaska have not been substantiated and thus remain hypothetical. Targeted surveys and specimens are needed to document their occurrence. Leatherback Seaturtle A. Species description Common name: Leatherback Seaturtle Scientific name: Dermochelys coriacea B. Distribution and abundance Range : Global range comments: Wide ranging in Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans; generally forage in temperate waters, ne st on beaches in tropi cal and subtropical latitudes; cold-tolerant species, nonbreeders often seen at high latitudes. State range comments: Marine turtles are associated with the North Pacific Ocean and the interface between these waters and the shoreline of Alaska. Leatherbacks probably occur here as part of their normal habits , because they are a cold-water species that feeds on jellyfish (B. Wing, NOAA, personal communication). Abundance : Global abundance comments: Unknown, listed as critically endange red by IUCN, and endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act State abundance comments: Uncommon, 19 records from 1960 to 2003 368 Appendix 4, Page 147 Trends : Global trends: Declining throughout its range State trends: Few records from the state make it difficult to establish trends, but probably similar to global tr ends. Historically, occurrences in high latitudes of the North Pacific Ocean were associated with warm-water years; however, occurrences since 1960 do not reflect this connection. Fr om 1960 to 1983, most sightings were of live leatherbacks; however, since 1983, few have been documented. References: Eckert 2003; Hodge and Wing 2000; MacDonald 2003; Wing 2004 C. Problems, issues, and concerns for species Very little is known about any aspect of Leatherback Seaturtle ecology in Alaska. Concerns in Alaska are unknown but outsi de the state include: habitat loss, incidental catch in commercial fisherie s, and harvest of eggs and adults. D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Alaska marine waters - pristine E. Concerns associated with key habitats Lack of information concerning occurrenc e and habitat use in Alaskan waters. Several live turtles were caught in commerc ial fishing gear and subsequently died. F. Goal: Ensure Leatherback Seaturtle populations remain sustainable throughout their range within natural population-level variation and hist orical distribution in Alaska. G. Conservation objectives and actions State conservation and management needs : Objective : Maintain Leatherback Seat urtle populations that occu r within Alaskan waters. Target: Stable trend in annual occurrences of Leatherbacks in Alaskan waters over 25-year period. Measure: Documented occurrences of L eatherback Seaturtles in Alaska. Issue : Little is known about Leatherback Seaturtle eco logy in Alaskan waters. Conservation actions : a) Continue to monitor presence of Leat herbacks and other turtles in Alaska. b) Gather information on turtle sightings fr om fishermen and residents of coastal communities. c) Develop protocol for persons w ho find or capture live turtles. d) If numbers increase, attempt to le arn about habitat use in Alaska. e) Develop and distribute educational materi als about marine turtles in Alaska, specifically Leatherback Seaturtles; perm it requirements to handle turtles; and what to do if a turtle is seen alive or found dead. 369 Appendix 4, Page 148 Global conservation and management needs : Participate and assist, to the degree appropria te, in national and international efforts to conserve these species. H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats The USFWS Service has jurisdiction ove r marine turtles on land, while NOAA Fisheries has jurisdiction over marine turtles in water. In the past, B.L. Wing, NOAA, has monitored occurrences of marine tur tles in Alaskan waters and hopefully will continue to do so and serve as a clea ringhouse for additional data on seaturtle occurrences in Alaskan waters. A report on additional information should be submitted prior to the revision of this plan in 10 years. I. Recommended time frame for reviewing species status and trends Review at 10 years. J.

Of Alaska's 365 million- acre surface, 50-60% is considered suitable wate rfowl habitat, made up of rich coastal lagoons and river deltas, large inland valleys , and vast areas of wet tundra and boreal muskegs. Production of waterfowl in Alaska re sults not only from expansive and stable wetlands, but also from dynamic physical processes (floods, fires, co astal interfaces) that enrich habitats, and bursts of productivity from long summer days. The fall flight of waterfowl from Alaska provides 120,000 sw ans, 1 million geese, and 10-12 million ducks to all 4 North American flyways. A nnually, Alaska produces or seasonally hosts waterfowl that are shared with Canada, Mexico, Russia, and Japan. Alaskans depend on an annual harvest of about 400,000 migratory game birds for nutritional, economic, cultural, and recreationa l benefits. In addition, harvest and other benefits from many Alaska-br eeding populations are realized most in Canada and the Lower 48 states. Because Alaska's migratory game bird popul ations range internationally across many jurisdictions, management of these resources is governed by federal authority. However, they provide substantial benefits to cultura lly and geographically di verse public interests that are best engaged at state and regional levels. The utility of multilevel management and the valuable capabilities of state wildlif e agencies led to the formation of flyway councils in the 1950s. Councils, made up of stat e wildlife agencies, provide the necessary cooperation to efficiently coordinate manage ment efforts and balance the interests of agencies and user groups. The state of Alaska is a member of the Pacific Flyway Council, but also interacts with the Central, Mi ssissippi, and Atlantic Councils on shared populations. Management efforts are aimed primarily at monitoring distribution and trends of breeding bird populations, a ssessing annual production and factors that influence populations of concern, measur ing and managing harvest, and promoting habitat conservation th rough land use planning. Waterfowl are not treated at le ngth in this iteration of the CWCS because there is an extensive research and management network at regional, national, and continental levels. Research and management needs of nearly a ll populations of swans and geese that occur in Alaska are addressed by i ndividual flyway management plans. Most duck populations are managed under programs of the North American Waterfowl Management Plan, national harvest strategies, and some flyw ay and regional plans. Thus, pages 58-65 of this appendix focus primarily on a group of sea duck species that breed in Arctic and sub- Arctic regions, have undergone substantial population declines, and for which there is neither adequate information about their st atus and biology nor a cohesive management plan. Using criteria shown in Section II(C) (CWCS page 10), CWCS expert participants also selected Spectacled and Steller's Eiders (b oth listed as Threatened), and White- fronted Geese, as being of major conserva tion concern. These are populations for which 371 Appendix 4, Page 150 existing information and management plans do not currently provide means to secure long-term conservation. Information on each of these species follows. Tule White-fronted Goose (Anser albifrons gambeli) Tule geese two subspecies of gr eater white-fronted geese in North America. Since the early 20th century, they were recognized as a larger and darker bird wintering with Pacific White-fronts ( A. a. frontalis ) in California (Swarth and Bryant 1917), but their breeding grounds were unknown until 1979. Nesting Tule geese were first located in the Redoubt Bay and Susitna Flats areas of Cook Inlet, Alaska (Timm et al. 1982). Periodic aerial surveys of Cook Inlet coastal marshes indicate that the use of Redoubt and Trading Bays by Tule geese declined significantly some time between 1983 and 1992 (Campbell et al. 1992); few Tule geese have been seen there in recent years. Telemetry studies since 1994 indicate that most Tule geese now nest in the Kahiltna and Susitna River valleys, and as far north as the Tokositna River (USGS and ADF&G, unpubl. data). The coincident decline of Tule geese at Re doubt Bay and discovery of nesting in valleys north of Cook Inlet may reflect displacemen t of the breeding population from a major eruption of the Redoubt Volcano in December 1989. Telemetry also indicates that one- third to half of the populati on crosses the Alaska Range to molt in the Innoko River basin during midsummer. Since the early 1980s, various methods have be en used to enumerate Tule geese at 7000- 9000 birds, making them one of the smallest po pulations of geese in North America. For over 20 years, management has been focused on basic research and protection of this vulnerable population; the Pacific Flyway pl an (Pacific Flyway Council 1991 [revision in progress]) summarizes needs fo r fundamental information. Alt hough this plan is currently under revision, there is insufficient informa tion to guide management actions for the long-term conservation of this population: (1) To date, no reliable method has been established to estimate populat ion size on the breeding grounds where they are dispersed in boreal forest habitats, or on the wintering grounds where they are obscured among 380,000 Pacific White-fronts. (2) Tule goose breeding grounds are almost entirely on state lands that are subject to timber sales, oil and gas leases, and increasing recreational activity. (3) Although Tule gees e largely evade harvest th rough seasonal and spatial segregation, and harvest strate gies in the Pacific Flyway are designed to avoid them, some Tule Spectacled Eider (Som ateria breed in of three geographi c areas: Arctic Russia, the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta (YKD) in western Alaska, and Alaska 's Arctic Coastal Plain. The rapid decline in Spectacled Eiders on th e YKD was the primary reason for listing this species as threatened in 1993 (USFWS 1993). Between the 1970s and 1990s, Spectacled Eiders on the YKD declined by about 96 percen t, from 48,000 pairs to fewer than 2,500 pairs in 1992 (Stehn et al. 1993; USFWS 1999). Since then, the population on the YKD has increased slightly (Fischer et al. 2004; Pl atte and Stehn 2003). The vast majority of the worldwide population, mostly composed of Russian breed ing birds, winters in the Bering Sea, where estimates range up to 363,000 birds (Larned and Tiplady 1999; Peterson et al. 1999). 372 Appendix 4, Page 151 The focus of the 1996 recovery plan (USFWS 1996) is to provide strategies for the recovery of Spectacled Eiders; assess potential threats from socioeconomic, political, biological, and ecological mechanisms; develop strategies to mitigate or alleviate these threats; and monitor populat ion change. Specific mechanis ms causing the decline or limiting recovery, however, remain unknown. Pr imary hypotheses that continue to be implicated in the decline of the eiders, mo stly affecting adult survival, include lead poisoning on the YKD, changes in food supply at sea, exposure to marine contaminants, overharvest, increased predation on the YKD br eeding ground, and disturbance of nesting birds by researchers (USFWS 1993; Stehn et al. 1993). The current r ecovery plan does not adequately provide for the long-term cons ervation of Spectacled Eiders because: (1) the cause(s) for the decline in numbers a nd distribution of the YKD breeding population are unknown; (2) there are no hist orical trends from the Arctic Coastal Plain from which to verify a decline or estab lish realistic recovery objectives; (3) recovery strategies largely address mitigating potential threats th at may be impediments to recovery; and (4) without knowledge of the causes of population declines, the efficacy of strategies to actively increase the population is largely speculative. Steller's Eider (Polysticta stelleri) Three breeding population segments have been designated for Steller's Eiders, two in Arctic Russia (Atlantic and Pacific) and one in Alaska. The Alaska breeding population occurs in 2 separate regions: the Yukon-Ku skokwim Delta (YKD) in western Alaska and the North Slope, primarily near Barrow (USFWS. 2002). The Alaska breeding population of Steller's Eiders was list ed as threatened in 1997 (USFWS. 1997), largely because of a reduction in its breeding range as it becam e extremely rare on the YKD (Kertell 1991). Although there are few quantitative data from the region, Steller's Eiders on the YKD historically composed the larg est number of this species br eeding in Alaska. Up to a few thousand eiders may nest irregularly on th e North Slope (Quakenbush et al. 2004), where long-term changes in numbers and distri bution are poorly known (Quakenbush et al. 2002). The majority of the Pacific population (over 100,000 birds) nests in Russia, and winters in Alaska from the eastern Aleutian Islands east to lower Cook Inlet. Although Russia- breeding birds are not included in the ESA listing, they intermingle with Alaska breeders for most of the year, which complicates rec overy efforts. The Russian Pacific breeding population of Steller's Eiders was recognized as a category 3 (\"rare\") species in the Red Book for the Yakutia Republic because of re duced breeding range, declining numbers, and illegal harvest (Solomonov 1987). In addi tion, there has been a declining trend in birds wintering along the Alaska Peninsula (Larned 2003). The focus of the 2002 recovery plan (USFWS 2002) is to provide strategies for the recovery of Alaska-breeding Steller's Eiders; assess potential threats from socioeconomic, political, biological, and ecological mechanisms; develop strategies to mitigate or alleviate these threats; and m onitor population change. Specific mechanisms causing the decline or limiting recovery in Alaska, however, remain unknown. Primary hypotheses include lead poisoning, overhunti ng, nest predation, a nd changes in the 373 Appendix 4, Page 152 marine environment (USFWS 2002). The curre nt recovery plan does not adequately provide for the long-term conservation of Ste ller's Eiders because: (1) the magnitude and cause(s) for the decline in numbers and distribution of breeders on the YKD are unknown; (2) there are no historical trends fr om the Arctic Coastal Plain from which to verify a decline or establish realistic recove ry objectives; (3) recove ry strategies largely address mitigating potential thr eats that may be impediments to recovery; and (4) without knowledge of the causes of population declines, the efficacy of strategies to actively increase the population is largely speculative.

Species group description Common names : Diminished sea duck species in Alaska (selected species that are largely endemic to Alaska, and have experi enced significant declines); these include Pacific 4, Page 154 B. Distribution and abundance Range : Global range comments: Breeding range: Circumpolar in Arctic , sub-Arctic, and Nonbreeding range: Principally coastal marine waters of Bering Sea and northeastern and northwestern Pacific Ocean State range comments: Breeding: Alaska's coastal tundra and Interior wetlands. Alaska wintering birds include some that breed in Russia and Canada Nonbreeding: Coastal marine waters for winter, migration, staging, and molting; Alaska breeding birds also use coastal wa ters of Russia and Canada for migration, staging, molting, and wintering Abundance : Global abundance comments: Population es timates (current and historical) are considered unreliable for most species. In general the lack of comprehensive surveys and knowledge of distribution and movements allows for gross estimates only (\"best guesses\") of population size (Sea Duck Jo int Venture 2003; Savard et al. 1998; Brown and Fredrickson 1997; Bordage and Savard 1995). Surveys often combine species groups, especially scoters. Pacific Common Eider: Estimates of 100,000 in North America and 22,000 minimum in Siberia. King Eider: Western Arc tic: Possibly up to 470,000 including 100,000 in Russia. Black Scoter: Historic estimates up to 550,000 (Savard et al. 1998). Currently unknown. Surf Scoter: Estimates range from 257,000 to 765,000. White-winged Scoter: Historic estimates of up to 675,000 birds. Currently unknown. Long-tailed Duck: Historically up to 4 million. Currently unknown, 500,000 minimum. State abundance comments: Estimates not re liable. Generally lit tle information on seasonal distribution and abundance; survey data seldom comparable. Estimates during breeding, molting, and wintering vary greatly and may not represent population units, as birds migrate long dist ances to vast and remote regions for various life history events, often across international borders, (see Alaska status summary [USFWS 1999]) Pacific Common Eider: Estimate up to 67,000 in winter. Many fewer breeding. King Eider: Arctic Coastal Plain br eeding population about 7750. Up to 370,000 during migration from wintering areas primarily in Russia and Alaska. Black Scoter: Winter unknown. Breed ing population estimates of 102,000. Surf Scoter: Winter population es timates up to 275,000. Breeding unknown. White-winged Scoter: Winter estima tes greater than 100,000. Breeding unknown. Long-tailed Duck: Currently unknown. Wi nter population greater than 220,000. Greater numbers during migration. 376 Appendix 4, Page 155 Trends*: Global trends: (Sea Duck Joint Venture 2003) In general, a lack of comprehensive surveys and standardized methods makes it di fficult to extrapolate regional trend data to a global scale. The North American Waterfowl Breeding Population Survey was not designed to coincide w ith the life history patterns of sea ducks. Surveys often combine similar species, especially scoters. Pacific Common Eider: Downward tr end. Possible 50% decline of spring migrants since 1976. King Eider: Declines of 40-75% since 1960s. Black Scoter: Declining about 1% annually. Surf Scoter: Possibly declined up to 2% annually since 1950s. May have stabilized. White-winged Scoter: Possibly declined up to 2% annually since 1950s. May have stabilized. Long-tailed Duck: Western North American population declined 70% since 1960s. State trends: (Sea Duck Join t Venture 2003; USFWS 1999). Pacific Common Eider: Breeding populat ion declined 4.5% annually from 1976 to 1994. May be stable or in creasing since late 1980s. Currently below historic levels. King Eider: Stable or in creasing slightly on Arctic Coastal Plain since 1990. Declines in winter/migra nts of 55% from 1976 to 1996. Black Scoter: Breeding populations declin ed about 2% annually from 1977 to 1998 in western Alaska, otherwise stab le or increasing since 1988. Currently below historic levels. Surf Scoter: Possibly declined up to 2% annually since 1950s. May have stabilized or increase d since late 1980s. White-winged Scoter: Possibly declined up to 2% annually since 1950s. May have stabilized or incr eased since late 1980's. Long-tailed Duck: Declines of 5.5% annually since 1977 in breeding population. May have stabilized on Arctic Coas tal Plain since 1986 and increased on Yukon Delta since 1988. *Trends primarily reference breeding populations. Little time-series data is available to quantify changes in numbers of winteri ng or molting birds. For most species, sea ducks are most abundant in Alaska du ring winter from October through May.

Problems, issues, or concerns for species group Overview of problems: Sea ducks congregat e in large dense flocks during migration, molting, and winter. This makes large number s vulnerable to oil spills, other marine contaminants, disturbance, or habitat ch anges in areas where birds concentrate. Migrate over vast and remote regions under various governmental jurisdictions. Relatively little knowledge of population delineation, trends, life history, and ecology. Lack of good baseline information on popul ation status, trends, and distribution Climate change Marine pollution Changes in prey abundance Avian and mammalian predation Overharvest/lead poisoning Off- and onshore mineral and energy development Commercial fishing and ma riculture interactions D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Breeding habitat (Savard et al. 1998; Br own and m 2000): Generally very good with exceptions, although overall c onditions are largely unknown. Pacific Common Eider: Along marine coasts, mostly on barrier islands, river deltas, spits King Eider: Arctic tundr a near lakes and ponds Black Scoter: Deltas, tundr a and taiga lakes and ponds Surf Scoter: Boreal forest lakes, rarely on tundra White-winged Scoter: Boreal fo rest lakes, rarely on tundra Long-tailed Duck: Coastal and interior tundra Non-breeding habitat good with exceptions (includes molting and winteri ng areas), although overall conditions are largely unknown. Pacific Common Eider: Shallo w offshore marine waters King Eider: Offshore marine wa ters and edge of sea ice Black Scoter: Nearshore marine waters Surf Scoter: Nearshore marine waters White-winged Scoter: Near- and offshore marine waters Long-tailed Duck: Near- and offshore marine waters E. Concerns associated with key habitats See Section C. F. Goal: Ensure sea duck populations remain su stainable throughout th eir range within natural population-level vari ation and historic distribution throughout Alaska. 378 Appendix 4, Page 157 G. Conservation objectives and actions Objective : Conserve and manage sea duck population levels at a sustainable level within their historic range. Target: Specific population objectives have not been set because available inventory data are not reliable a nd a geographic regime for management has not been established; establishing population goals and objectives is one of the primary management needs for each species. Measure: Population indices are currently ba sed on several standard and special surveys: a) Alaska-Yukon Waterfowl Breeding Popul ation Survey (not designed for sea ducks). b) Arctic Coastal Plain survey. c) Miscellaneous regional surveys. Establishing survey methods and protocol s at a local, regional, and continental scale is a primary management need (see below). Issue 1: Lack of reliable information to delineate populations and ranges. Conservation actions: a) Improve population delineation th rough increased banding, marking, telemetry, and genetic studies. b) Expand existing level of research/monitoring. Issue 2: Lack of effective survey methods to produce abundance and trend data. Conservation actions: a) Develop and implement effective population survey and monitoring techniques at continental, regional, a nd local scales (Sea Duck Joint Venture 2001) during breeding, molting, staging, and wintering periods. b) Expand existing level of monitoring. Issue 3: Important coastal habitats for staging, molting, and wintering are not identified or inventoried. Conservation actions: a) Identify, inventory, and a ssess attributes of important coastal habitats for staging, molting, and wintering. b) Develop statewide sea duck GIS. c) Identify potential impacts from development activities, vessel traffic, oil spills, commercial fishing, and subsistence activities. Issue 4: Lack of baseline data on the prevalence and effects of diseases, parasites, and contaminants on sea duck populations. 379 Appendix 4, Page 158 Conservation actions: a) Implement field and laboratory studies to screen for diseases, parasites, and contaminant exposure and assess effects. b) Continue and expand programs to reduce exposure to lead shot. c) Monitor contaminant levels in prey. Issue 5: It is not known if climate change is negatively impacting these sea ducks. Conservation action: Monitor sea duck population trends, abundance, and distribution, and test for co rrelations with climate change on a regional basis. Issue 6: Changes in prey abundance may be affecting sea duck populations. Conservation actions: a) Identify primary prey species at ke y winter, staging, and molting sites. b) Monitor prey intake and changes over time. Issue 7: Lack of baseline data on the prevalence and effect s of predators and unknown population effects of avian and mammalian predation. Conservation actions: a) Identify and evaluate abundance and e ffects of predator populations during breeding, molting, and winter on a regional basis. b) Identify situations where human activities may enhance predator/scavenger populations. Issue 8: Lack of knowledge on sea duck population age and sex structure makes it difficult to understand th eir population dynamics. Conservation actions: a) Identify population age and sex structur e and age-specific su rvival rates to improve understanding of population dynamics. b) Expand existing level of research/monitoring. Issue 9: Unknown levels of harvest over range of species makes it difficult to understand mortality rates and effect of harvest on population. Conservation actions: a) Improve surveys of recreational and s ubsistence harvest ov er the range of species in the United States and Canada. b) Expand existing level of research/monitoring. 380 Appendix 4, Page 159 H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats Plan proposal: A 10-year time frame is proposed to implement conservation and management needs. A comprehensive su rvey and monitoring program will be developed at continental and regional scales over the next few years. Surveys will be conducted at index locations on a predeter mined schedule of once every 1-5 years. Planning and implementation of monitoring programs will involve partnerships within the Sea Duck Joint Venture (an international program of the North American Waterfowl Management Plan), USFWS divisions of Migratory Bird Management and Refuges, the USGS, Alaska Native vill age and regional corporations, National Audubon Society, Ducks Unlimited, Inc., Canadian Wildlife Service, flyway councils, and other state and federal agencies with re gulatory or management authority within a species range. The lead agency will be determined on an individual project basis. I. Recommended time frame for reviewing species status and trends Review every 5 years, or at more frequent intervals in response to additional information. J. Bibliography Bordage, D. and . In: A.

USFWS., Migratory Bird Management, Anchorage, AK. 137 p. 382 Appendix 4, Page 161 Waterbirds - Introduction For development of this plan, \"waterbirds\" does not include waterfow l or shorebirds, as both of those groups are dealt with separately. Nor does it include Osprey (dealt with by the Raptors group) or Belted Kingfisher or Am erican Dipper (dealt with by the Landbird group). Aside from loons and grebes, the onl y other waterbird we therefore felt fell within our purview was Great Blue Heron. This species is continentally abundant and widespread, and without any obvi ous conservation concern with in Alaska, we elected not to dwell on this species. Thus , our Waterbirds group developed templates just for loons Four for one for Red-throated Loons, one for all loons, and one for grebes. The rationale for the 2 species-specific treatments was that good abundance and/or tr end information exists for loons, and for 2 species\u2014Yellow-billed and Red- throated Loons\u2014significant conservation concern at a state and national level is warranted. A group was made for all loons because (a) some type of threats to populations are common to all loon species, due to their similar life history, and (b) the other 3 loon species in Alaska are of less immediate conservation concern, but nonetheless, some localized conc erns exist and this grouping provided the forum to identify issues. Alaska's 2 grebe species were grouped into a single template primarily because so little is known about their populations and ecology to usefully develop unique, species-specific templates. Grebes A. Species auritus B. Distribution and abundance Range : Global range comments (both Red-necked Grebe and Horned Grebe): Breeding range: and boreal habitats. Non breeding range: Coastal marine waters of northeast and northwest Pacific, and northeast and western Atlantic ; occasionally winters on the Great Lakes in the United States; Horned Grebe winters locally on inland lakes, rivers, and reservoirs, mainly south of latitude 38\u00b0N. State range comments (both Red-ne cked Grebe and Horned Grebe): Breeding: South of the Brooks Range; absent from the Aleutian Islands and Southeast Alaska. Nonbreeding: Coastal marine areas from th e Aleutian Islands to Southeast Alaska. 383 Appendix 4, Page 162 Abundance : Global abundance comments (Red-necked Grebe): Lack of information to indicate; 45,000 + individuals estimated in North America (Stout and Nuechterlein 1999). State abundance comments (Red-necked Grebe): 12,000 (individuals) (R. Platte, USFWS, personal communication) estimated for Alaska. Global abundance comments (Horned Grebe): Lack of informati on to indicate; 200,000+ individuals estimated in North America (Stedman 2000). State abundance comments (Horned Grebe): Lack of information to indicate. Trends: Global trends (Red-necked Grebe): Lack of information to indicate. State trends (Red-necked Grebe): Aerial survey data collected annually from 1988 to 1998 in the coastal zone of Yukon Delta Nationa l Wildlife Refuge suggests that the local breeding population is declini ng at a rate of 10% a year (R. Platte, USFWS, personal communication). No clear trend for the rest of the state. Global trends (Horned Grebe): Lack of information to i ndicate. In North America, breeding range has shown slow, long-term c ontraction northwestward and NABBS data show significant negative trend contin entwide from 1966 to 1996 (Stedman 2000). State trends (Horned Grebe): Lack of information to indicate. C. Problems, issues, or concerns for species group Little is known about either population in Alaska for all aspects of breeding and nonbreeding populations Horned Grebe breeding range has shown slow, long-term contraction northwestward and NABBS data show significant negativ e trend for North America from 1966 to 1996 (Stedman 2000) Unknown molting locations may pose a c onservation concern to both species populations because of their tendenc y to aggregate in one spot Commercial and subsistence gi llnets are potentially importa nt sources of mortality for grebes Position at the top of the food chain makes grebes susceptible to biomagnification of contaminants Lake dynamics and changing phenology associat ed with global climate change may have effects on populations Invasive and introduced fish, e.g. north ern pike, can alter the composition and abundance of prey and have negative effects on productivity Hazards associated with development: a) Increase in predation of eggs and chic ks due to increase in predator numbers b) Increase in predation and nest failure due to increase in lake traffic and recreational disturbance 384 Appendix 4, Page 163 c) Toxic contamination d) Oil spills e) Draining of potholes for road-buildin g and development (Horned Grebe) f) Destruction of emergent vegeta tion near lakefront properties g) Decreasing water levels as resu lt of deforestation around wetlands h) Eutrophication of lakes from fertilizers (r unoff from lawns) degrades prey base D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Breeding habitat: Red-necked Grebe: (very good to pristin e habitats, with local differences) Mainly on shallow, freshwater lakes (>2 ha.) or shallow, protected marsh areas and secluded bays of larger lakes, usually with at l east some emergent vegetation Horned Grebe: (generally pristine, with local differences) Small to moderate sized (0.5-10 ha) fa irly shallow, freshwater ponds and marshes with beds of emergent vegeta tion and substantial areas of open water Secluded bays of larger lakes, usually with at least some emergent vegetation Nonbreeding habitat: (concern that some are degraded) Red-necked Grebe: Coastal marine waters from Yellow Sea to central California Horned Grebe: Coastal marine and inshore freshwater habitats from the Yellow Sea to Baja Peninsula E. Concerns associated with key habitats See above. F. Goal: Ensure Red-necked Grebe and Horned Grebe populations remain sustainable throughout their range within natural population- level variation and hi storic distribution across Alaska. G. Conservation objectives and actions Objective : Maintain healthy and viable grebe population levels. Target: Combined grebe populations in Alaska of 30,000 (based on 13 years of aerial surveys2); species difficult to differentiate during aerial surveys. Measure: population numbers for the different species as indicated by the Alaska Waterfowl Breeding Population survey.

Problems, issues, or concerns for species Designated by USFWS as a bird of conservation concern (USFWS 2002) Wintertime threats unknown, but concern abou t Asian waters where habitats may be degraded (contaminants, particularly merc ury; overfishing; bycatch of loons) Breeding area threats include bycatch of l oons in commercial and subsistence fishing nets; contaminants; and changes in lake dynamics, breeding season length, and marine fish communities associated with global climate change Hazards, particularly for the North Slope, associated with development: a) Increase in predation of eggs and chicks due to increase in predator numbers b) Increase in predation and nest failure associated with increases in air and ground traffic disturbance c) Toxic contamination d) Oil spills D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Breeding habitat (Barr et al. 2001; USFWS survey data6): (generally pristine, with local differences) Small, low-lying tundra lakes less than 2 m deep Small lakes less than 5 ha Within 20 km of the ocean 4 Data from 2 surveys flown by USFWS-Migratory Bird Management: the Arctic Coastal Plain survey and the North Slope Eider survey. 5 Ibid. 6 Ibid. 393 Appendix 4, Page 172 Nonbreeding habitat (Barr et al. 200 1; Schmutz, J., unpublished data) : (concern that some are degraded) Coastal marine habitats from the Yellow Sea to Baja Peninsula E. Concerns associated with key habitats See above. F. Goal: Ensure Red-throated Loon populations rema in sustainable throughout their range within natural population-level variation and historic distribution across Alaska. G. Conservation objectives and actions Objective : Maintain viable Red-throat ed Loon population levels. Target: Maintain a population of at least 10,000 to 20,000 adult breeders. Measure: Population number as indicated by the Arctic Coastal Plain Survey and the Alaska Waterfowl Breeding Population survey.7 Issue 1 : Surveys not well-designed for loons. Don't know how well surveys measure population; surveys are not designed specifically for loons relative to timing and stratification. The two North Slope waterbird surveys give ve ry disparate views on popul ation trend for this species (greater disparity th an for all other species).8 Conservation action: Conduct studies to evaluate phenology of birds' arrival and initiation of breeding relative to survey timi ng and climatic variations. Also, evaluate detectability of breeders vs. nonbreeders and detection differences among observers. Issue 2 : Inadequate survey to monitor. Conservation action: Implement survey to evaluate current productivity surveys. Issue 3 : Anecdotal evidence indicates that Red-thro ated Loons are bycatch in commercial and subsistence fishing, but the extent of this problem is unknown. Conservation actions: a) Conduct a survey for Red-throated L oon bycatch on breeding area rivers b) Conduct surveys to determine how many l oons are caught in nets and how many hours the nets are fished. c) Outreach and collaboration (education to reduce bycatch) Issue 4 : Contaminants may reduce productivity a nd other aspects of demography in Red- throated Loon populations, based on pr ecedence of common loons (Evers 2004). 7 Ibid. 8 Data from 2 surveys flown by USUSFWS-Migratory Bi rd Management: the Arctic Coastal Plain survey and the Alaska-Yukon Waterfowl breeding population survey. 394 Appendix 4, Page 173 Conservation actions: a) Institutionalize contaminants monitoring program of loon tissues and prey. b) Identify sources of contaminants. c) Compare levels observed in loons to othe r bird populations in the local area. d) Identify an acceptable level of contamination for Red-throated Loon; data is available for common loons. Issue 5 : Changes in fish prey abundance may reduce the productivity of loons. Conservation action: Targeted study areas to conduct sampling, on regular basis, to determine fish abundance (e.g., Alaska blackfish, and rainbow smelt; see both marine and freshwater fisheries strategies). Issue 6 : Concerns about inadequate productivity levels and other life table parameters, particularly in survival rates. Conservation action: Conduct studies to estimate survival and productivity simultaneously. Issue 7 : North Slope Red-throated Loon may be dis tinct population and be exposed to higher risk of oil spill/contaminant and other risks, based on knowledge that they winter in East Asia (Schmutz, J., unpublished data). Conservation actions: a) Determine if North Slope population is diffe rent (genetically unique) from rest of Alaska population. b) If unique, conserve that population. Issue 8 : Summertime distribution of nonbreeder s is unknown, which limits adequate assessment of risks posed by oil spills and other disturbances. Conservation actions: a) Conduct marking studies. b) Develop conservation measur es in identified areas. Issue 9 : Development activity may impact reproduc tive success (productiv ity), either through an increase in predation of eggs and chicks due to increase in predator numbers, or through an increase in predation and nest failure due to increase in air and ground traffic disturbance. Conservation actions: a) Measure behavior and demographic paramete rs in areas likely to be developed. Do in an experimental context to enable ascribing variati on in demography to predators or othe r disturbance. b) Monitor predator numbers in newly developed areas. c) Implement management actions to reduce human impacts that encourage predators. 395 Appendix 4, Page 174 H.

Problems, issues, or concerns for species USFWS was petitioned to list Yellow-billed Loons as a threatened species, due to the small population size, geographically restricted breeding grounds, and their perceived vulnerability to human imp act. Breeding range is expected to experience an increase in disturbance associated with energy development. Wintertime threats uncertain but possibl y significant; use Asian waters where capture of loons in fishing nets, reduced foraging options for loons due to fishing effects, and contaminants are all factor s that are not currently well known but are suspected to potentially be significant to th is species. Mercury is a contaminant of particular concern. Accidental bycatch of loons in fishing nets (commercial and subsistence) also may be an issue on breeding grounds. 9 Data from 2 surveys flown by USFWS-Migratory Bird Management: the Arctic Coastal Plain survey and the Alaska-Yukon Waterfowl breeding pair survey. 10 Ibid. 397 Appendix 4, Page 176 Lake dynamics and changing phenology associ ated with global climate change Hazards associated with development: a) Increase in predation of eggs and chicks due to increase in predator numbers b) Increase in predation and nest failu re due to increase in air and ground traffic disturbance c) Toxic contamination d) Oil spills e) Lake draw-downs D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Breeding habitat: (curren tly they are pristine) Large, low-lying tundra lakes greater than 2 m deep (Earnst et al. 2004).

Inadequate information on Seward Peninsula populations. Conservation action: Conduct studies to evaluate phe nology of birds' arrival and initiation of breeding relative to survey timi ng and climatic variations. Also, evaluate detectability of breeders vs. nonbreeders and detection differences among observers. Issue 2: Inadequate survey to monitor productivity. Conservation action: Implement survey that is representative of the Arctic coastal plain population. Issue 3: Development activity may impact repro ductive success (produ ctivity), either through an increase in predation of eggs and chicks due to increase in predator numbers, or through an increase in predation and ne st failure due to increase in air and ground traffic disturbance.

Do in an experimental cont ext to enable ascribing variation in demography to predators or other disturbance. b) Monitor predator numbers in newly developed areas. c) Implement management actions to reduce human impacts that encourage predators. Issue 4: Inadequate knowledge of lake-specifi c nesting distributi on within potential development areas. Conservation actions: a) Conduct additional lake circling surveys to identify additional nesting lakes in areas likely to be developed. b) Work with industry and agencies to promote specific conservation and mitigation measures for identified nesting lakes. Issue 5: Lake drawdowns are likely to negatively impact Yellow-billed Loons' reproductive success (Evers 2004). Conservation actions: a) Encourage industry to avoid significant drawdown of Yellow-billed Loon nest lakes during nesting season, either known or predicted. b) Refine habitat models to enable better prediction of nest lakes. Issue 6: Anecdotal evidence indicates that Yellow- billed Loon are bycatch in commercial and subsistence fishing, but the ex tent of this problem is unknown. 399 Appendix 4, Page 178 Conservation actions: a) Conduct a survey for bycatch on breeding area rivers. b) Conduct surveys to determine how many loons are caught in nets and how many hours nets are fished. c) Conduct outreach. Issue 7: Vulnerability of Yellow-billed Loon to oil spills, and other development impacts, is believed to be important, but the effect on nonbreeding adult populations is unknown. Conservation actions: a) Conduct marking studies to unders tand distribution of nonbreeders b) Ensure oil companies have contingency plans for spill response that address needs of wildlife and loons. Issue 8: Contaminants may reduce productivity and other aspects of demography in Yellow-billed Loon populations, based on pr ecedence of common loons (Evers 2004). Conservation actions: a) Institutionalize a contaminants monito ring program of loon tissues and prey. b) Identify sources of contaminants. c) Compare levels observed in loons to othe r bird populations in the local area. d) Identify an acceptable level of contamination for Yellow-billed Loon; data is available for common loons. Issue 9: Lack of knowledge regarding what fish species Yellow-billed Loons use or prefer, thus difficult to predict impact of natural or anthropogenic effects on fish populations on Yellow-billed Loons. Conservation actions: a) Conduct study to identify fish prey selection. b) Monitor relevant fish populations. Issue 10: Uncertain if Yellow-billed Loons breeding in Alaska are demographically and genetically distinct from those elsewhere in the world (central Canada and Russia). Conservation actions: a) Conduct additional satellite tag studies and initiate a population genetic study. b) Promote conservation of genetically distinct population segment if warranted. H.

Schmutz, J.A., USGS, unpublished (http://www.absc.usgs.gov/staff/ WTEB/jschmutz/Gavia_adamsii_36404.jpg Page 180 Seabirds - Introduction Alaska's productive seas and isolated islands provide habitat for one of the largest and most diverse assemblages of marine birds in the world. The marine ecosystems that sustain marine birds also support some of the world's largest commercial marine fisheries and support numbers of coasta l communities through economics re lated to fisheries or by providing subsistence food. Marine birds are indicators of the health of the marine ecosystem. Because various species of seabirds use different portions of the marine food web, they provide insight into changes in bot h the plankton and forage fish communities. In April 2004, ADF&G convened a group of marine bird experts and asked these scientists to develop a short li st of species and/or species gr oups to feature in the CWCS, including specific conservation actions that could be starte d in the next decade. More than 40 species of seabirds occur in Alaska, but the group decided to select species based on 2 types of criteria. One group was selected because Alaska has the majority of the world's populations and/or th ere is concern because they have declining populations. The group included: Murre let. The second group included species that are recognized indicators of change in marine ecosystem. Species included to represent plankton feeders were Fork-tailed and Leach's Storm-Petrels (surface feeders) and Least and Crested Auklets (divers). Species that pr ey on forage fish included Black-legged Kittiwake, and Common and Thick-billed Murres. The Short-tailed Albatross was first listed under the federal Endangered Species Act on June 2, 1970. It is currently designated as e ndangered throughout its entire range. A draft formal recovery plan is expected to be completed by the USFWS in mid 2005. NOAA - Fisheries actively engages the commercial fi shing industry to minimize take in longline fisheries. Japan provides legal protection for the species, and actively manages its nesting habitat. Commercial import, export, or trade across international bor ders is prohibited by the CITES. Additional information on the Short-tailed Albatross can be found at http://alaska.fws.gov/fisheries/ endangered/pdf/STALfactsheet.pdf Conservation actions designed to protect marine birds and their habitats shown on the following templates will likely benefit seabirds, but also provide insight into processes that cause change in the marine ecosystem , thereby assisting managers in long-term conservation of these important areas. Leach's and Fork-ta iled Storm-Petrels Rationale for selection: These species were selected because: Species are endemic (i.e., occur primarily in Alaska or occur en tirely within an ecoregion found in Alaska). O. furcata furcata is endemic in southwest Beringia and the Kuril region of Russia. Species are sensitive to e nvironmental disturbance. 402 Appendix 4, Page 181 Species are representative of broad array of other species found in a particular habitat type (surface-feeding planktivore). Species are important internationally (e.g., targeted for cross-jurisdictional action and/or recognized in bi- or multilateral agreements; or useful for cross- jurisdictional monitoring), and will require cooperativ e monitoring with Canadian Wildlife Service.

Concerns associated with key habitats Threat of rat spills, chronic oiling, cl imate change (changes in the food web), attraction/collisions with fishing vessels and platforms in the ocean due to light pollution Attributes surrounding species success : Most of the nesting habitat lies within federal conservation system units; no commercial harvest currently occurs for forage species; oil discharge regulations; lack of human disturbance; foxes removed from certain islands. F. Goal: Ensure storm-petrel populations rema in sustainable throughout their range within natural population-leve l variation and historical distribution across Alaska . 404 Appendix 4, Page 183 G. Conservation objectives and actions State conservation and management needs : Objective : Restore storm-petrel po pulations and distribution to pre-mammal introduction conditions (i.e. reestablish populations on islands after intr oduced mammals are removed). Target: Maintain Alaska-wide populations at least at levels existing in year 2000. Measure: Populations at index locations w ould be surveyed (e.g., Buldir, Ulak, Aiktak, East Amatuli, St. Lazaria Islands) at least once every 3 years for 20 years; monitor islands where introduced mammals have been removed to detect reestablished populations. Issue 1 : Populations are sparsely monitored; specific winter range is not well-defined. Conservation actions : a) Determine wintering locations. b) Maintain a monitoring program. c) Complete a nesting inventory. Issue 2 : Introduced predators, such as rats and foxes, cause increased mortality by consuming eggs and killing adults and young. Th is results in effectively eliminating or greatly reducing the populati on size of many seabirds. Conservation actions : a) Prevent additional rat introductions. b) Educate ship crews about rat introduction. c) Evaluate reestablishment on islands wh ere introduced mammals have been removed. Issue 3 : Human disturbance at particular times may contribute to mortality rates through such things as \"seabird wrecks\" (where larg e numbers of seabirds are attracted to a fishing boat in bad weather and then are in jured or killed while landing on the boat). Conservation actions : a) Evaluate disturbance at index colonies. b) Monitor and evaluate instances of \"sea bird wrecks\" with fishing boats from fishery observer notes; then seek ways to minimize them (Rojek 2001). Issue 4 : Prey abundance variability Conservation action: Monitor foraging species status and trends (state-managed waters, 0-3 miles). Issue 5 : Contaminants, oil pollution, including chronic oiling (maybe bilge dumping) 405 Appendix 4, Page 184 Conservation actions : a) Conduct research to measur e contaminants in eggs. b) Ensure compliance with di scharge regulations for oil and other contaminants. Issue 6 : Light pollution (from fishing vessels working near colonies or in major foraging areas) may attract or disorient seabirds, lead ing to collisions and mortality, which is known as a type of \"seab ird wreck\" (see Issue 3). Conservation actions : a) Educate (ship crews) about light polluti on issue and care and release of birds that come aboard. b) Encourage efforts to shield lights laterally. Issue 7 : Climate change (changes in the food web). Conservation action: Monitor foraging species status and trends (state-managed waters, 0-3 miles). Global conservation and management needs : Conservation action: Add an index location site in Russia for monitoring within 5 years. H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats Surveys would be conducted at index lo cations once every 3 years for 20 years. Add a site in Russia within 5 years. Colony surveys would be conducted at the index locations (all within the federal refuge system). USFWS is a potential partner. TNC to take a lead on adding Russian site. I.

Species is rare (i.e., small/low overall population size/density). Species is designated as at risk (threa tened, candidate, or endangered under ESA; state endangered or species of con cern; depleted under Marine Mammal Protection Act). Species is endemic (i.e., occurs primarily in Alaska or occurs entirely within an ecoregion found in Alaska). Species makes seasonal use of a restrict ed local range (breeding, wintering, and migration). Species is sensitive to environmental disturbance. Species is representative of broad array of other species f ound in a particular habitat type. Species is important internationally (e.g., targeted for cross-jurisdictional action and/or recognized in bi- or multilateral agreements; or useful for cross- jurisdictional monitoring). Human Uses Viewing, ceremonial/subsistence A. Species description Common name : Red-faced Cormorant Scientific name: Phalacrocorax urile B. Distribution and abundance (see map page 227, Appendix 4) Range : Global range comments: Southern Alaska, Prince William Sound, Aleutian Islands, Commander Islands, Kuril Islands (USFWS 2003) Breeding: Russia, northern Sea of Ja pan and Kuril Islands (Causey 2002). Winter range: Dispersed throughout breeding range (Causey 2002). State range comments: Thought to be largely resident Breeding: Gulf of Alaska extending th roughout the Alaska Peninsula and Aleutian Islands. (Causey 2002). Wintering range: Dispersed througho ut breeding range (Causey 2002). Abundance : Global abundance comments: 155,000 individuals (as of 1993) (Causey 2002, USFWS 2003) State abundance comments: 20,000 individuals (USFWS 2003) 1 Use of the word \"species\" includes species, subspecies and distinct populations. 407 Appendix 4, Page 186 Trends : Global trends: Generally declining, unknown for Ru ssian populations (Causey 2002) State trends: Declining (Dragoo et al. 2003) C. Problems, issues, or concerns for species Existing Incidental mortality in fishing gear (Man ly et al. 2003; 2 were taken in Kodiak setnet fishery, which extrapolated to ~ 28/year; this was high relative to local population) Exotic mammals (e.g., rats, foxes) Habitat change, such as the kelp fore st changing and warming temperatures Prey abundance variability Oil pollution, includi ng chronic oiling (maybe bilge dumping) Potential Oil spills Highly susceptible to disturbance at ne sting sites (commercial fishing, tourism near to shore) Contaminants Disease Localized overharvests D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Nesting and roosting: Cliff ledges on oceanic islands or the mainland coast, the majority of which lie within designated c onservation lands. These areas are generally pristine, but some have introduced predators. Foraging: Inshore marine waters, generall y less than 50 m deep (Causey 2002): some areas are degraded by chronic oiling; this hab itat includes kelp forests that will decline as sea otter populations declin e. May also be subject to effects of bottom trawling and derelict fishing gear. The Near Islands are a particularly high c oncentration area, probably due to the large expanse of shallow feeding areas. This area is subject to chronic oiling and substantial changes in the kelp forest due to changes in sea otter populations. Areas of significance: Attu, Agattu, and Semichi Islands. E. Concerns associated with key habitats Summer Nesting: threat of rat spi lls, change in land management and/or status, land use regulations. Foraging: chronic oiling, climate change (changes in the food web), gillnet mortality and entanglement in derelict fishing gear. 408 Appendix 4, Page 187 Winter Foraging: chronic oiling, climate change (changes in the food web), gillnet mortality and entanglement in derelict fishing gear. Attributes surrounding species success : Most of the nesting/roosting habitat lies within conservation units; no commercial harv est currently occurs for forage species such as capelin, sand lance, small demersal fi shes, but cormorants also eat juveniles of rockfish, cod, pollock, flatfish, and herring, al l of which are fished commercially; oil discharge regulations; la ck of human disturbance; foxes removed from certain islands. F. Goal: Ensure Red-faced Cormorant populations remain sustainable throughout their range within natural population-level variation and histor ical distributi on across Alaska. G. Conservation objectives and actions State conservation and management needs : Objective : Restore Red-faced Cormorant population levels to those of the late 1970s by 2025. (1970s represent first \"comprehensive\" baseline numbers). Target: Alaska-wide population of 50,000 individuals. Measure: Populations at index locations w ould be surveyed (Near Islands, Kodiak, Amak, Rat Islands, Pribilof s) once every 5 years for 20 years. Issue 1 : Cause of the population decline is unknown; issues preventing population recovery are unknown. Conservation actions : a) Measure shifts in nesting colonies, a dult mortality, reproductive success, and other vital rates to eval uate conservation status using demographic models. b) Evaluate disease and gillnet mortalit y as a factor in population declines. c) Evaluate preferred habitat features and changes in nearshore, benthic habitats, and fishes. Issue 2 : Incidental mortality in fishing gear. Conservation actions : a) Reduce mortality related to fishing and fishing gear - learn more about fisheries occurring in Red-faced Cormoran t habitat and extent of interactions (temporal and spatial overlap and fact ors associated with entanglement). b) Conduct studies to devise bird-safe gillnet gear and practices. Issue 3 : Predation by or impacts from exo tic mammals (e.g., rats or foxes). Conservation actions : a) Conduct additional predator removal programs. b) Prevent rat introductions. c) Conduct rat response program. 409 Appendix 4, Page 188 Issue 4: Habitat or climate chan ge, such as the kelp fo rest changing and warming temperatures (concerns with changes in the food web). Conservation action: Monitor changes in nearshore mari ne habitats in selected areas to evaluate the status and trends of forage fish species used a prey by cormorants (state-anaged waters, 0-3 miles). Issue 5 : Prey abundance variability. Conservation action: (see above, Habitat or Climate change) Issue 6 : Contaminants, oil pollution, including chronic oiling (maybe bilge dumping). Conservation actions : a) Bilge control (chronic oiling); monitor/improve oil spill planning and response (product shippers). b) Evaluate contaminants in Red-faced Cormorant eggs. c) Conduct regular beach bird surveys in selected areas. Issue 7 : Human disturbance at nesting sites (tou rism near shore, commercial fishing). Conservation action: Monitor increase of ecotourism at or near cormorant nesting areas; educate to avoid disturbance of Red-faced Cormorants. Issue 8 : Localized overharvest. Conservation actions : a) Monitor harvest or other human use. b) Educate subsistence users to identify different cormorant species and teach them about population problems of this species, its rarity and uniqueness to Alaska, and ecotourism interest. Global conservation and management needs : Objective : Determine global population trends outs ide Alaska and interchange between Russian and U.S. populations. Target: 5-year review and update of available data and use of genetics and telemetry to evaluate interchange. Measure: Maps, population estimates and trends for key areas. Issue : Consolidate bycatch information available outside Alaska and determine whether Russian populations are unique genetica lly compared to Alaska populations. Conservation action: Education; provide our pr oducts to international lists. 410 Appendix 4, Page 189 H.

Areas of Significance: Port Mo ller Spit, Yakutat, Icy Bay, Sa fety Lagoon and Amchitka Island 424 Appendix 4, Page 203 E. Concerns associated with key habitats Summer breeding: threat of rat spills, chronic oiling, climate change (changes in the food web) Change in land management status and/ or land use regulations (research: how many sites are within/out side conservation areas) Winter foraging: oil spills Attributes surrounding species success : Most of the nesting/roosting habitat lies within protected areas; no commercial harvest currently occurs for forage species; oil discharge regulations; lack of human disturbance; foxe s removed from certain islands. F. Goal: Ensure Aleutian Tern populations remain sustainable throughout their range within natural population-leve l variation and historical distribution across Alaska. G. Conservation objectives and actions State conservation and management needs : Objective : Restore Aleutian Tern p opulation levels to those of the late 1970s by 2025 (1970s represent first \"comprehe nsive\" baseline numbers). Target: Alaska-wide population of at least 10,000 individuals (late 1970s estimate). Measure: Populations at index locations w ould be surveyed (e.g. Port Moller Spit, Yakutat, Icy Bay, Safety Lagoon a nd Amchitka Island) once every 5 years for 20 years. Issue 1 : Except for effects of the 1964 earthquak e, factors causing the population decline or preventing populatio n recovery are unknown. Conservation action: Determine factors affecting population decline and recovery. Issue 2: Population is not monitored; winter range is unknown. Conservation actions : a) Establish a monitoring program includi ng species identification training. b) Determine wintering locations. c) Measure productivity. d) Complete a nesting inventory. Issue 3 : Human disturbance. Conservation actions : a) Evaluate disturbance at index colonies. b) Educate public to avoid dist urbance of Aleutian Terns. 425 Appendix 4, Page 204 Issue 4: Introduced predators. Conservation actions : a) Prevent rat introductions. b) Control domestic and feral dogs and cats. Issue 5: Prey abundance variability. Conservation action: Determine foraging habits. Issue 6: Contaminants; oil pollution, includi ng chronic oiling (e.g., bilge pumping). Conservation actions : a) Measure contaminants in Aleutian Tern eggs. b) Monitor compliance to regulations on oil a nd contaminant discharges from ships. Issue 7: Ship wakes can cause waves that flood nests. Conservation action: Develop an education and outreach program to fishing, tour, and recreational vessels. Issue 8: Heavy predation by gulls. Conservation action: Control sources of gull attract ion (e.g., uncovered dumps) near tern colonies. Global conservation and management needs : Objective : Determine the extent of interacti on and genetic exchange with Russian populations. Target: Genetic markers and/or radiotelemetry in place on an adequate sample of birds from each population to determine interaction. Measure: Number of genetic markers and/ or radiotelemetry relative to the population sizes. Issue : Are the populations di stinct genetically? Conservation action: If distinct, Alaska populations need even more scrutiny. H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats Surveys would be conducted at index lo cations once every 5 years for 20 years. Colony surveys would be conducted at the index locations by ADF&G. USFWS, NPS, USFS, and the Copper River Delta Inst. (USFS), the Prince William Sound Science Center, and TNC are potential partners. 426 Appendix 4, Page 205 I.

Common and Thick-billed Murres Rationale These species were selected because: Species are sensitive to e nvironmental disturbance. Species are representative of broad array of other species found in a particular habitat type. Species are important internationally (e.g., targeted for cross-jurisdictional action and/or recognized in bi- or multilateral agreements; or useful for cross- jurisdictional monitoring). Human Uses Subsistence egging, subsis tence hunting, and viewing. A. Species group description Common names : Common Murre and Thick-billed Murre Scientific names: Uria aalge and and abundance (see maps pages 232-235, Appendix 4) Range : Common Murre Global range comments: circumpolar, sub-Arctic and Arctic regions Breeding: Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Sea of Okhotsk, and Chukchi Sea along Asian coast of Bering Sea to Kamchatka. Wintering: pelagic south of ice e dge, little islands in the Pacific State range comments: Breeding: Southeast through Gulf of Alas ka and Aleutian Islands, north to Cape Lisburne. Winter range: Pelagic, south of ice edge, Gulf of Alaska, Aleutians and Southeast Alaska. 427 Appendix 4, Page 206 Thick-billed Murre Global range comments: circumpolar, sub-Arctic and Arctic regions Breeding: Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Norw ay, Siberian Coast, Kamchatka, and Sea of Okhotsk. Wintering: open waters off of breeding sites State range comments: Breeding: Southeast through Gulf of Alas ka and Aleutian Islands, north to Cape Lisburne. Winter range: Pelagic, south of ice edge, Gulf of Alaska, Aleutians and Southeast Alaska. Abundance : Common Murre Global abundance comments: 13.0-20.7 million individuals (Ainley 2002) State abundance comments: each species approximately 5 million (USFWS 2003) Thick-billed Murre Global abundance comments: 15-20 million individuals (Gaston 2000). State abundance comments: both species approximately 5 million (USFWS 2003) Trends : Common Murre Global trends: Changes in decadal sea surface temper atures in climatic indices seem to be associated with changes in murre population levels. Overall, no clear trend direction. Likely declining in Atlantic, but unclear trends in Pacific. (D. Irons, USFWS, unpubl. data) State trends: Unclear (Dragoo Global trends: Eastern Canada stable or increas ing, Greenland substantially decrease during 1940s to 1980s probably unchanged since then. (Gaston 2000). State trends: Unclear (Dragoo 2003). 428 Appendix 4, Page 207 C. Problems, issues, or concerns for species group Existing In the past, gillnet fisheries impacted murre populations, particularly in California, but this problem has been resolved in California. Gillnets are still a s ource of mortality in Alaska; murres were the most common bycatch in gillnets in studies done in Prince William Sound, South Unimak, and Kodiak (W ynne et al. 1991; Manly et al. 2003). Exotic mammals (e.g., rats, foxes) Habitat change due to changi ng and warming temperatures Prey abundance variability Oil pollution, including chr onic oiling (may be bilge dumping); most of birds killed in 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spil l were murres (Piatt et al. 1990) Interactions with fisheries - gillnets, etc. Mortality in dereli ct fishing gear Winter die-offs (most common species in seabird die-offs) (Piatt and Van Pelt 1997) may indicate starvation problems in winter, or presence of marine biotoxins, which can increase as sea temperatures increase Potential Oil spills Disturbance at nesting sites (commerc ial fishing, tourism near to shore) Contaminants Egging and harvest Increased occurrence of toxic algae blooms, etc., due to warming of water temperature D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Summer: Breeding: Cliff ledges on oceanic islands or the mainland coast, the majority of which lie within designated conservation lands. Thes e areas are generally pristine, but some have introduced predators. Foraging: Common murre, marine waters within 60-0 km of colony; thick-billed murres, up to 170 km from colony (Gaston 2000). Winter: Foraging: In offshore marine waters (though they occasionally occur in large numbers in some inside waters, such as Prin ce William Sound, Resurrection Bay [USFWS unpubl. data]) 429 Appendix 4, Page 208 Areas of particular significance : Common Murre: St. George, Round Island, Hall Island (USFWS 2003). Cape Pierce, Bluff, Chammisso, Puffin Islands, St. La wrence Island, and Little Diomede Island. Most big Bering Sea islands (St. Matthew, Hall, St. Lawrence, Little Diomede are about 50% Common Murre and 50% Thick-billed Murre, and so are significant to both species. Thick-billed Murre: St. George (USFWS 2003) and Cape Lisburne. Cape Thompson and Cape Lisburne in the eastern Chukchi Sea are about 70% Th ick-billed Murres and 30% Common Murres. E. Concerns associated with key habitats Summer breeding: threat of rat spills, change in la nd management status and land use regulations Summer foraging: oil spills, climate change (changes in the food web), changes in land use regulations, toxic algae blooms Winter foraging: oil spills Attributes surrounding species success: Most of the nesting habitat lies within conservation units; no commercial harvest cu rrently occurs for forage species; oil discharge regulations; la ck of human disturbance; foxes removed from certain islands; introduced rat prevention programs; minimal subsistence harvest by Alaskans (relative to Atlantic communities) F. Goal: Ensure murre populations remain sustai nable throughout their range within natural population-level vari ation and historical di stribution across Alaska. G. Conservation objectives and actions Objective : Maintain 2004 population levels of murres. Target: Maintain Alaska breeding populati on of 5 million individuals of each species, along with a vi able global population. Measure: Index of abundance for both murres, (They are currently monitored by USFWS periodically [some annually, others no t] at locations in Alaska [common: at approximately 15 locations ; thick-billed at approximately 10 sites] mostly federal refuges but also some state lands [e.g., Round Islands] and Native land [Gull Island in Kachemak Bay]. These tr ends reported regularly in \"Breeding Status, Population Trends and Diets of S eabirds in Alaska\"). Continue current level or increase monitoring, since these sp ecies have been included as indicator species. Issue 1 : Additional introduction of exotic predator s and rats (often called \"rat spills\" when animals escape from shipwrecks) can cause reduced produc tivity and population declines because introduced predat ors eat adults, chicks, and eggs. 430 Appendix 4, Page 209 Conservation actions : a) Conduct additional predator removal programs. b) Prevent rat introductions. c) Conduct rat response program. Issue 2 : Prey abundance variability ca n cause reproductive failures. Conservation action: Monitor foraging species status and trends (state-managed waters, 0-3 mi). Issue 3 : Contaminants, oil pollution, including chronic oiling (may be bilge dumping). Conservation actions : a) Bilge control (chronic oiling); oil spill planni ng and response (product shippers)\u2014one idea/measure is to develop and distribute a multilingual press kit/education and outreach program designed to reduce chronic oiling. b) Continue or expand existing level of research/monitoring. Issue 4: Climate change (changes in food web). Conservation actions : a) Monitor winter die-offs more consistently; implement regular beach surveys with set protocol. Combine with lab an alysis of body condition, contaminants, toxins. b) Continue or expand existing level of research/monitoring. c) Monitor species status and trends (state-managed waters, 0-3 mi). Issue 5 : Disturbance at nesting sites (comme rcial fishing, tourism near shore). Conservation actions : a) Reduce fishing around colonies, especia lly trawl and gillnet fisheries. b) Educate pilots about low f light around active colonies. c) Clean up derelict fishing gear, especially pots and gillnets. Issue 6 : Egging and harvest by Alaska Natives may cause local reductions in productivity and potentially reduce local populations. Conservation actions : a) Improve certainty of populat ion counts in Alaska b) Monitor egging and compare colonies subject to egging vs. not egged. 431 Appendix 4, Page 210 H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats Surveys would be conducted at index locati ons on the current schedule of once every 1-5 years.

Species has noticeably declined in abundance or productivity from historical levels outside the range of natural variability. Species is designated as at risk (threa tened, candidate, or endangered under ESA; state endangered or species of con cern; depleted under Marine Mammal Protection Act). Species is sensitive to environmental disturbance. Human Uses Viewing A. Species description Common name : Marbled Murrelet Scientific name: Brachyramphus marmoratus B. Distribution and abundance Range : Global range comments: Nests in coastal forests in North American and Asia, in the Pacific. Breeding: Coastal areas of Russia and Japan (Nelson 1997) Wintering: Few data, marine habitat similar to breeding State range comments: From Southeast Alaska th rough the Aleutian Islands and Bristol Bay Breeding: Coastal areas of Alaska; prim arily bays, inlets and fjords (Nelson 1997). Wintering: Few data, marine habitat similar to breeding, farther off shore in some areas of Gulf of Alaska (Nelson 1997). Abundance : Global abundance comments : Unknown, but over 947,500 (McShane 2004) State abundance comments: About 850,000 individuals as of 1994 (Agler 1998), but this estimate includes surveys > 10 yrs old, and likely now lower. Trends : Global trends: Unknown for Asian populations, declining in United States (Stephenson 2001) State trends: Declining (Nelson 1997, Stephensen 2001) in most areas; exception is Kenai Fjords, where numbers increase d between 1986 and 2002 (after decline between 1976 and 1986; Va n Pelt and Piatt 2003). 433 Appendix 4, Page 212 C.

Potential Contaminants Aquaculture Logging D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Summer Nesting: Generally, individuall y nest in trees in older co astal forests; a few nest on the ground in tundra, scree slopes, or cli ffs. Many forest nesting areas have been degraded by logging. Foraging: Inshore marine waters. Conditi ons range from pristine to degraded. Winter Foraging: Inshore marine waters to contin ental shelf. Conditions from pristine to degraded. Areas of significance: Prince Willia m Sound, Southeast Alaska, Lower Cook Inlet/Kenai Peninsula. (Afognak was a high-density nesting area [USFWS, and Kodiak bays may W ildl. Refuge, Unpubl. data]). associated with key habitats Summer Nesting: Habitat degradati on due to logging nest trees. Sp ruce beetle infestation and other conifer diseases (i.e., cedars in S outheast Alaska) degrading nesting habitat (currently associated with global warming, and this may increase). Foraging habitat: Disturbance, degradation (i .e., by dumping of pollutants, waste, and toxins), and mortality by cruise and fishing vessels, climate change, oil spills. Rich, well-protected bays are prized by aquaculture. 434 Appendix 4, Page 213 Winter Foraging: Potential chronic oiling from b ilge pumping, climate change, oil spills. Attributes surrounding species success: No commercial harvest currently occurs for some forage species (capelin, sand lance, Myctophids, smelts), but Marbled Murrelets also feed on juveniles of herring (important prey in many areas), cod, pollock, and older age classes of these species are harvested. F. Goal : Ensure Marbled Murrelet populations remain sustainable throughout their natural range within natural population-level variation and hi storical distribution across Alaska. G. Conservation objectives and actions State conservation and management needs : Objective : Restore Alaska's Marbled Murre let population to 1994 levels by 2025. Target: Alaskan population of about 750,000 individuals. Measure: Apply index of abundance for dete rmining population levels at key sites, including Southeast Alaska, Prince William Sound, Kodiak Island, and Cook Inlet.

Species has noticeably declined in abundance or productivity from historical levels outside the range of natural variability. Species is rare (i.e., small/low overall population size/density). Species is designated as at-risk (threatened, candidate, or endangered under ESA; state endangered or species of con cern; depleted under Marine Mammal Protection Act. Species is endemic (i.e., occurs primarily in Alaska or occurs entirely within an ecoregion found in Alaska). Species makes seasonal use of a restrict ed local range (breeding, wintering, and migration). Species is sensitive to environmental disturbance. Species is disjunct (i.e., isol ated from other populations or occurrences in adjacent ecoregions). 438 Appendix 4, Page 217 Human Uses Viewing A. Species description Common name : Kittlitz's Murrelet Scientific name: Brachyramphus brevirostris B. Distribution and abundance (see map page 236, Appendix 4) Range : Global range comments: Alaska and Russian Far East (Day 1999). Breeding: Arctic, sub-Arctic and boreal wate rs off of Eastern Russia (Day 1999). Wintering: Range is poorly known, recorded al ong outer edge of pack ice in southeast Bering Sea (Day 1999). Found in low densities in northern Gulf of Alaska; prefer the Alaska Coastal Current and mid-shelf regions, and avoid the shelf-break front and Alaska St ream (Day and Prichard 2001). State range comments: Breeding: Glaciated areas, from Glacier Bay to Alaska Peninsula; small populations south of Glaci er Bay in Holkham Bay, and in some nonglaciated areas of northwestern Alaska (Day 1999). Wintering: Range is poorly known, recorded in open waters of Prince William Sound and in Southeast Alaska over open c ontinental shelf near submerged shoals (Day 1999). Also in low densities thr oughout the Alaska Coastal Current and mid-shelf regions of northern Gulf of Alaska (Day and Prichard 2001). Abundance : Global abundance comments: Unknown; Day et al. (1999) estimated Russian population to be only 5% of total; thus, ba sed on estimate for Alaska (USFWS 2004), global population may be about 10,000-28,000. Ru ssian population not well surveyed and may be higher than prev iously noted (Vyatkin 1999). State abundance comments: Based on rigorous survey s and anecdotal accounts for smaller populations, estimated to be about 9500-26,700 individuals (as of 2003) (USFWS 2004). Trends : Global trends: Declining (unknown for Russian populations) State trends: Declining 439 Appendix 4, Page 218 C.

Issue 5 : Climate change; habitat lo ss from melting glaciers. Conservation action: Quantify physical parameters of summer foraging habitat and compare where Kittlitz's now occur and where they used to occur. Issue 6 : Disturbance from mineral exploration in some areas. Conservation action: Prior to exploration, survey or assess potential for Kittlitz's Murrelet nesting in the area. 441 Appendix 4, Page 220 Global conservation and management needs : Objective : Determine size and genetic re latedness of Russian population. Target: Obtain statistically valid population estimates with confidence intervals for key regions. Measure: At-sea surveys, extrapolations from birds/km2. Issue : Gillnet mortality (has been documented in Russian waters), oil spills. Conservation actions: a) Document location and extent of gillnet mortality, overlap of Kittlitz's and fisheries. b) Monitor oil spills, sites and sources of chronic pollution. H.

Concerns associated with key habitats Threat of rat spills, chronic oiling, cl imate change (changes in the food web) Attributes surrounding species success : Most of the nesting habitat lies within protected areas; no commercial harvest cu rrently occurs for forage species. F. Goal: Ensure auklet populations remain sust ainable throughout their range within natural population-level vari ation and historical di stribution across Alaska. G. Conservation objectives and actions Objective : Restore Least and Crested Auklet popul ation and distributio n to pre-fox, pre- rat introduction condi tions (i.e., reestablish populati ons on islands after introduced mammals are removed). Target: Maintain Alaska-wide populations at least at year 2000 levels. Measure: Populations at index locations woul d be surveyed (e.g., Buldir, Kiska, Kasatochi, St. Matthew, and St. Lawrence Islands) at least once every 3 years for 20 years. Evaluate also reestablishm ent on islands where introduced mammals have been removed. Issue 1 : Population is sparsely monitored.

Since raptors are high trophic- level predatory birds, they serve as indicator species of ecological cha nges and other human-induced influences or impacts and may serve as \"barometers\" of significant impacts in the ecosystem. Some raptors are secretive and not well known or understood, and these species have been included to further understand a nd conserve little-known species. This account is an assemblage of templates that addresses the conservation of raptors using species with historical baseline studies that demonstr ate sensitivity to environmental or ecological changes. Monitori ng of selected raptor populations in Alaska largely began in the mid 1970s, with particular emphasis on cliff-nest ing raptors in tundra regions, peregrine falcons in Interior and Arctic Alaska, Bald Eagles in south coastal areas, and forest owls in Southcentral Al aska. Species templates were developed to include species with conservation concerns representing a cross-section of biomes (tundra, boreal forest, and temperate rain fo rest), contaminant-affected species, migrant species, forest owl species, restricted hab itat species, little-known species, and high- profile species of public interest. Six templates covering single species or gr oups of species are presented. Additional introductory information is provided at the beginning of each template: Northern Goshawk ), representing boreal forest and temperate rain forest habitats (respectively) where forest management (logging, fire) may affect species through changes in habitat and/or prey. Contaminant-affected sp ecies (Peregrine Falcon, Falco Merlin, Falco columbarius ) associated with aquatic habitats and the presence of environmental contaminants. Migrant raptors (Golden Eagle, Aquila chrysaetos ; Rough-legged Short-eared Owl, Asio flammeus) that may have some conservation concerns away from Alaska while migrating and/or on th eir wintering grounds. Forest owl species in coastal temperat e rain forest (Western Screech-Owl, Megascops kennicottii also found in boreal forest) boreal Gray Owl, Strix nebulosa Boreal funereus; Northern Hawk Owl, Surnia ulula; Great Horned Owl) are little understood. Snowy Owl ( Bubo scandiacus ), a species closely linked of brown lemmings ( Lemmus sibiricus ) and highly responsive to varying abundance of 463 Appendix 4, Page 242 prey, nest in localized areas on the North Slope in close proximity to expanding oil/gas infrastructure and may be impacted by broad climate changes or localized resource development. Gyrfalcons with high public or scientific profile and rest ricted or specific habitat requirements, are representative of tundra and temperate rain forest habitats (respectively) where broad-scale changes in habitat or impacts from resource development would have significant imp act on species abundance or distribution. Northern Goshawk A. Species description description Common name : Northern goshawk Scientific name: Accipiter gentilis Two subspecies exist in Alaska, wi dely distributed Northern Goshawk (A. g. atricapillus ), which occurs throughout most of the state, and the Queen Charlotte Goshawk ( A. g. laingi ), which occupies the coastal temperate rain forests of Southeast Alaska (Squires and Reynolds 1997). These s ubspecies probably intergrade in northern Southeast Alaska (ADF&G unpublished data, Iv erson et al. 1996). For the purposes of this document, we regard goshawks in Southeast Alaska as A. g. laingi , and those in other portions of the state as A. g. atricapillus. B. Distribution and abundance Range : Global range comments: Holarctic. State range comments: A. g. laingi: Coastal temperate rain forest from Dixon Entrance to northern Southeast Alaska, boundary unknown. A. g. atricapillus: Boreal forests throughout state, northern extent not clear but sightings up to and beyond th e northern extent of trees. Abundance : Global abundance comments: Approximately 490,000 (Rich et al. 2004). State abundance comments: A. g. laingi: Unknown. A. g. atricapillus: No reliable population estima tes exist (USFWS 2001); Interior breeding density ranged from 1 pair/41 km2 to 1 pair/372 km2 (McGowan 1975), and appeared tied to snowshoe ha re numbers (Doyle and Smith 1994). Trends : Global trends: Unknown but thought to be stab le, increasing in some areas, decreasing in others. State trends: Unknown but potentially declining in some parts due to habitat alteration. Populations fluctuate with prey cycles. 464 Appendix 4, Page 243 C. Problems, issues, or concerns for species Queen Charlotte Goshawks are landscape species, i.e., use space at a landscape level of scale and thus are difficult and costly to study. Standard techniques used to locate breeding goshawks and monitor population have limited utility in Southeast Alaska. After a 10-year study, still do not have re alistic estimate of goshawk population in Southeast Alaska. Importance of prey specie s is not well understood. Goshawk ecology and habitat relationships in boreal forests are known only from specific locales and broad-ba sed information is needed. Effects of forest management are not well studied. Use of second-growth forest by goshawks in forest management areas is not well understood. Raptors in general and Northern Goshawks specifically, are susceptible to West Nile Virus (Saito et al. 2003, Ma rge Gibson, personal communication). D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas A. g. laingi : Coastal, temperate old growth - Goshaw ks nest and forage in forest stands with high timber volume and dense ove rstory canopy above a relatively open understory (Reynolds et al. good. A. g. atricapillus: Boreal forest, general (McGowan 1975); condition of this habitat is very good to pristine. E. Concerns associated with key habitats A. g. laingi : Forest management in portions of Southeast Alaska (for nesting and foraging): No knowledge of prelogging population status. Previous study in relation to fore st management practices has produced incomplete assessment of impacts on species. Nest-based management systems are not e ffective because goshawk nests are very difficult to locate. A. g. atricapillus : Changes in boreal forest habitat Possibly due to logging, death of forest from spruce bark beetle infestation, catastrophic fire caused by suppression, or some combination of the above. F. Goal: Ensure Northern Goshawk populations remain sustainable throughout their range within natural population-level variation and histor ical distributi on across Alaska. G. Conservation objectives and actions State conservation and management needs : Objective 1 : Conserve sustainable goshawk populations in Southeast Alaska. 465 Appendix 4, Page 244 Target: A naturally distributed popu lation in Southeast Alaska. Measure: Index of abundance based on survey of known nesting areas. Issue: Considerable effort has gone into surveying for breeding goshawks and monitoring known nests, yet these resulting data are insufficient for a reliable assessment regarding the status of gos hawks in Southeast Alaska. Conservation actions: a) Maintain habitat capable of sustaining goshawks distributed through the region. b) Maintain current old-growth reserve system stipulated in Tongass National Forest - Forest Plan (TLMP). c) Employ resource selection modeling based on existing nesting and foraging habitat data to build predictive model to determine what landscape is most favorable to goshawks. d) Work collaboratively to review existing goshawk conservation measures in TLMP. Objective 2 : Manage habitats to ensure long-te rm sustainable goshawk populations in Southeast Alaska. Target: Integrated forest management that provides for sustainable goshawk populations in Southeast Alaska. Measure: Conservation strategies associ ated with forest management. Issue: Review current standards and guidelines in forest plan. Conservation actions: a) Evaluate existing goshawk conservation measures in TLMP. b) Based on interagency goshawk study, recommend refined standards and guidelines for conserving and sustaining goshawk habitats in a multiple use setting on national forest managed lands. c) Work with state and private land managers to conserve and sustain goshawk habitat in a multiple use setting. d) Coordinate with agencies in Britis h Columbia to compile information on Queen Charlotte Goshawk and standardize techniques. e) Coordinate with Northern Goshawk researchers in other states on management and conservation guidelines and strategies for this species. f) Publish results of ADF&G/USFS cooperative goshawk study. Objective 3 : Learn more about Northern Goshawk ecology in Southeast Alaska. Target: More complete understanding of gos hawk ecology in Southeast Alaska. Measure: Data concerning goshawk ecology, ha bitat relationships, and prey ecology. 466 Appendix 4, Page 245 Issue 1: We have little knowledge about the ecology of important prey species of goshawks in Southeast Alaska , Conservation actions: a) Learn best methods to survey prey species to determine density in a variety of landscapes. b) Learn how key prey species are associated with forest management. Issue 2: A lack of knowledge concerning how forest management affects goshawks. Conservation actions: a) Investigate species response to la nd management practices, especially logging; determine if there are thresh olds in the amount of the landscape logged below which goshawk populations decline. b) Quantify relationship between amount of mature forest and nesting density and survival. Issue 3: A lack of knowledge concerning how goshawks use second-growth forest. Conservation actions: a) Determine how goshawks use second growth. b) Determine if second growth can be managed to improve it for goshawks, or make it available to them sooner for foraging. c) Partner with USFS to study second-growth management to improve habitat for goshawks, their prey, and other wildlife. Issue 4: Standard inventory methods do not provide consistent method to monitor goshawk population. Conservation action: Develop a standardized, cost-effi cient protocol for inventory, data collection, and monitoring. Issue 5: Efficacy of nest-based conservation strategy. Conservation action: Investigate landscape level cons ervation strategy for goshawks in Southeast Alaska (and possibly in conj unction with British Columbia) similar to that being used in Southwest regi on of USFS (Reynolds et al. 1992). Issue 6: Little knowledge of goshawk ecology and habitat re lationships on boreal forests of state. 467 Appendix 4, Page 246 Conservation action: Develop population status and trend information over broad areas of boreal forest (document populations , locations, habitat used, diet, and other aspects of ecology). Issue 7: Little knowledge concerning potential impact of West Nile Virus on goshawks and their susceptibility to this virus in Alaska. Conservation action: Collaborate with existing ADF&G and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention efforts on surv eying dead birds for virus to detect if (or when) virus appears in Alaska. H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats ADF&G recently completed field portion of long-term study of ecology and habitat relationships of goshawk in Southeast Alas ka. Data should be t horoughly analyzed in cooperation with other agencies, and future field work should rely on the results from previous work among all key agencies. I. Recommended time frame for reviewing species status and trends In 5 years, review state of knowledge (final results from interagency study will have been peer-reviewed and published); annual c ooperator meetings should be convened to outline the goals and objectives among all key agencies.

Osprey - stable Peregrine Falcon - increasing Merlin - stable or increasing C. Problems, issues, or concerns for species group All species vulnerable to effects of environm ental contaminants due to their top trophic position, aquatic associations , or documented contaminant concentrations with associated effects. Recent studies indicate c ontaminants are still a problem for raptors in the Aleutians. Being apical predators, owls tend to be susceptible to contaminant loading. Consumption of prey with small amounts of environmental contaminants can result in bioaccumulation, leading to death or diminishing the potential for successful reproduction. An obvious example is DDT and its derivatives that caused eggshell- thinning and reduced reproductive performance in peregrines. D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Peregrines: Aleutians, Interior rivers, North Slope rivers, Southeast Alaska coast - very good/pristine Bald Eagles: Aleutians, lake shore habitats , riverine areas, coastal areas - very good/pristine Osprey: Interior lakes and rivers - very good/pristine Merlin: Forest and tundra st atewide - very good/pristine These species occur in a variety of habita ts, which are in a variety of conditions. However, the primary issue is contaminant exposure, through point sources or atmospheric transport, in breeding, migrati ng, and wintering areas. This issue is not given to traditional evaluation of habitat qua lity, nor limited to within the state of Alaska. Within the state of Alaska, however , aquatic habitats ar e key to minimizing contaminant exposure. E. Concerns associated with key habitats Because aquatic habitats concentrate contaminan ts from large terrestr ial areas, they are key habitats to conserve from point s ource contamination, including leachate from landfills, mercury contamination from ol d mining sites, and persistent organic pollutants such as PCBs and DDT from milita ry, municipal, and industrial sites. 471 Appendix 4, Page 250 F. Goal: Conserve Peregrine Falcon, Bald Eagle, Osprey, and Merlin populations so that they remain sustainable throughout their na tural range and within natural population- level variation and there is no need for endangered species type of management. G. Conservation objectives and actions State conservation and management needs : Objective : Ensure that reproduction, mortality, and other population parameters are not significantly affected by contaminant concen trations in birds or their habitats. Target: Contaminant concentrations (mercury and persistent organic pollutants, including chlorinated and brominated co mpounds) below those associated with reproductive impairment (e.g. mercury < 0.5 ppm wet weight in eggs, Peakall et al. 1990). Measure: Periodic measurements of c ontaminants and reproductive or demographic parameters in breedi ng populations; compare contaminant concentrations to reproductive parameters and toxicity thresholds, and evaluate for trends through time. Issue 1 : Increases in levels of c ontaminants in these birds c ould affect their reproductive success and ability to sustai n current population levels. Conservation actions : Coordinate with other stat e and federal agencies to: a) Collect samples to assess presence a nd degree of contamination (addled egg, feather) using standardized protocols (e.g. USFWS 2003). b) Determine if contaminants are found in Alaska or are being obtained during migration or during the winter. c) Leverage funding for collection and analyses. d) Interpret and analy ze chemical and population parameter data as part of an interdisciplinary contaminant monitoring program. e) Monitor reproduction, mortality, or other population parameters in selected species affected by contaminants. Issue 2 : Point sources of contamination, in cluding leachate from landfills, mercury contamination from old mining sites, and pers istent organic pollutants such as PCBs and DDT from military, municipal, and industrial sites may concentrate in aquatic habitats and lead to increases in contamin ant levels in these bird species. Conservation actions : a) Monitor for presence of contaminants in raptors. b) Ensure contaminant levels in raptor hab itats or food do not exceed safe levels. 472 Appendix 4, Page 251 Global conservation and management needs : Objective : Similar to state conservation and management needs, above. Issue : Atmospheric transport of contaminants fr om other countries to northern regions. Ultimately, raptor exposure to environmental contaminants is a global threat requiring international cooperation and regulation. Conservation action: Participate in national and in ternational efforts to reduce impact of environmental contam inants to raptors (e.g., AMAP). H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats Integrate the American Peregrine Falcon pos t-delisting monitoring plan (USFWS 2003) with a comprehensive contaminant monito ring program that coordinates sample collections from ongoing studies and recomm ends contaminant sample collection every 3-5 years. Use the SWG Program to coordi nate and supplement existing monitoring program. Although sample-size dependent, th is is an appropriate interval (e.g., Ambrose et al. 2000) for raptors affected by contaminants. I. Recommended time frame for reviewing species status and trends Review and evaluate collected data at least every 5 years; revise strategy as appropriate based on contaminant concentratio ns in individual species.

The condition of habitats and threats along migration routes/wintering areas are major concerns for migratory raptors. Differing migration strategies and life histories need to be considered when developing conservation st rategies for these species. For example, species migrating into Central and South Amer ica may have greater threats than species wintering north of Mexico. Grouping these species provides a br oad-based connection based on their migratory behavi or, and it reduces the total nu mber of featured species requiring individual treatment. Diurnal Migrant Raptors A. Species group description Common and Scientific names: species group - diur nal migrant raptors Golden Eagle - Aquila chrysaetos Rough-legged - Buteo Owl - flammeus B. Distribution and abundance Range: Global range comments: Golden Eagle - Holarctic - open spaces with cliff-nesting habitat Rough-legged Hawk - Panboreal - taiga and tundra habitats Red-tailed Hawk - North and Central America, Caribbean Islands; diverse habitats - woodlands with open areas Sharp-shinned Hawk - New World: North and South America; deciduous, coniferous and mixed forest s (Bildstein and Meyer 2000) Northern Harrier - Holarctic; New World includes Central America (MacWhirter and Bildstein1996) Short-eared Owl - Holarctic; New Wo rld includes South America - open, nonforested habitats State range comments: can be found statewide. Abundance: Global abundance comments: variable by species Golden Eagle - up to 100,000 in Nort h America during 1970s; subsequent declines outside of Alas ka (Kochert et al. 2002) Rough-legged Hawk - no estimate of abundance; CBC estimate of 50,000 wintering birds in North America (Bechard and Swem 2002) 475 Appendix 4, Page 254 Red-tailed Hawk - B. j. harlani - no estimate of abundance Sharp-shinned Hawk - no estimate of abundance (Bildstein and Meyer 2000) Northern Harrier - no estimate of ab undance (MacWhirter and Bildstein1996) Short-eared Owl - no estimate of abundance State abundance comments: variable by species. Within specific habitats, certain species are frequent. Golden Eagle - high densities in Dena li National Park (Kochert et al. 2002) Rough-legged Hawk - high densities along so me rivers in some years associated with small mammal populations Red-tailed Hawk - unknown and variable by region and habitat Sharp-shinned Hawk - unknown Northern Harrier - unknown Short-eared Owl - unknown Trends: Global trends: unknown, but not believed to be d eclining, except perhaps for Short- eared Owl, which may be declining. Golden Eagle - declining in western Un ited States; stable in Denali National Park, Alaska; unknown in remainder of Alaska (Kochert et al. 2002). Rough-legged Hawk - Palmer (1988) repor ted no evidence of change in North America (Bechard and Swem 2002); natura l variations in abundance occur. Red-tailed Hawk - B. jamaicensis - recent increases, up to 30% in some areas; B. j. harlani - no data (Preston and Beane 1993). Sharp-shinned Hawk - declining in North America 1940s-1970s and again in 1990s (Bildstein and Meyer 2000). Northern Harrier - declining in North America during 20th Century due to loss of habitat (MacWhirter and Bildstein1996). Short-eared Owl - declining in North America since listed by National Audubon Society in 1976 (Holt and Leasure 1 993); declining in North America and designated high priority by Pa rtners in Flight (2004). State trends : currently undetermined. Habitat for Harlan's Hawk may be increasing in Southcentral Alaska with changes in hab itat. Prey-dependent species (Short-eared owl, Northern Harrier, Rough-legged Hawk, Gold en Eagle) can vary widely in annual abundance. Golden Eagle - unknown Rough-legged Hawk - unknown Red-tailed Hawk - unknown Sharp-shinned Hawk - unknown Northern Harrier - unknown Short-eared Owl - unknown C. Problems, issues, or concerns for species group Lack of knowledge about population size and trend (e .g., Sharp-shinned Hawk, Harlan's Hawk, Northern Harrier, Short-eared Owl, Golden Eagle and Rough- legged Hawk) 476 Appendix 4, Page 255 Migration corridors may not be well defined; patterns possibly too diffuse; difficulty of finding, and accessing, suita ble migration corridors; finding sufficient, qualified personnel to operate si tes; migration count data in Alaska is not reliable to monito r population trends Need for long-term data stewardship Potential impacts at wintering grounds such as shooting, poisoning, and habitat alteration and habitat loss As migrants, these species have increase d potential for exposure to West Nile Virus D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas tundra - very good temperate forest - variable by location boreal forest - variable by location Southcentral forests - spru ce bark beetle impacted temperate rain forest - variable by location migratory routes - variable by location wintering grounds - variable by location E. Concerns associated with key habitats Concerns for key breeding habitats in Alaska: logging - loss or conversion of nesting ha bitat has an impact on migrant species returning to Alaska to br eed (exception: Harlan's Ha wks and other species may actually benefit from conversion of dense or mature stands to more open areas). spruce bark beetle - created massive habita t change in Southcentral forests, which is likely to have impacts on migratory raptors that use this area. tundra - impact of resource developmen t (oil, gas and mining). Roads bring people, disturbance, increased competit ors/predators associated with humans (e.g., fox, ravens). F. Goal: Ensure that diurnal raptor populations remain sustainable throughout their range within natural population-leve l variation and historical distribution across Alaska. G. Conservation objectives and actions State conservation and management needs: Objective : Maintain diurnal migrants at sustainable population levels. Target: Maintain population indices within observed variability. Measure: Index of population size based on st andardized counts of migrants at established monitoring site s (to be considered in combination with breeding ground counts, reproductive estimates, etc.). Issue 1: Migration corridors may not be well defined; patterns po ssibly too diffuse; difficulty of finding, and accessing, suitable migration corridors. 477 Appendix 4, Page 256 Conservation actions: a) Identify and develop migratory monitoring sites by coordinating work and efforts with biologists from Yukon Te rritory, Canada and Hawk Watch International. b) Use protocol for identifying locatio ns established by Hawk Migration Association of North America. Issue 2: Finding sufficient, qualifi ed personnel to operate mon itoring sites is difficult. Conservation actions: a) Coordinate with organizations al ready involved (e.g., Alaska Bird Observatory, Hawk Watch International). b) Publicize the concept of migratory raptor management which utilizes standardized monitoring procedures within professiona l and/or volunteer birding community, e.g. Hawk Migrati on Association of North America. Issue 3: Lack of knowledge about populati on levels of diurnal migrants. Conservation action: Develop methods to link abundan ce and trend of migrants with their actual population size. Issue 4: Spruce bark beetle infestations have created massive habitat change in Southcentral forests, which is likely to ha ve impacts on migratory raptors that use this area. Conservation action: Coordinate with researchers i nvolved with consequences of spruce bark beetle infestation to assess potential impacts to migratory raptors. Issue 5: Potential impacts at wintering grounds (e.g., shooting Rough-legged Hawk and Golden Eagle, road kills, poisoning of Golden Eagle on ranches), habitat alteration and habitat loss. Conservation action: Use stable isotope methods to locate wintering grounds. Explore potential for feather an alysis to determine natal areas through use of stable isotopes. Issue 6: There is no single entity responsible for the long-term stewardship of data. Conservation action: Initiate discussions with pot ential governmental and nongovernmental organizations on who should be the lead coordinating group for data storage and standardi zed protocol development. Issue 7: As migrants, these species have increas ed potential for exposure to West Nile Virus, may be more susceptible to it, and may affect Alaska br eeding populations by succumbing to disease outside of Alaska. 478 Appendix 4, Page 257 Conservation action: Continue existing ADF&G and CDC efforts on surveying dead birds for virus to detect if (o r when) virus appears in Alaska. Global conservation and management needs: Conservation actions: a) Determine if Short-eared Owls are nomadic between continents. b) Consult Birds of North America accounts for global impacts. c) Access Bird Banding Lab database for in formation about band recoveries and returns to determine summer/winter relationships using existing data. H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats Year 1-2: review data and develop monitoring plan 1. Review existing information on migrati on monitoring in Alaska and western Canada. 2. Determine efficacy of additional monitoring and sample sizes necessary. 3. Use results from 1 and 2 to determine the feasibility of establishing more monitoring sites. 4. If monitoring or migrants is not feasible, evaluate alternatives. 5. If feasible, then establis h partnership with HawkWatc h International to start developing a migration monitoring strategy. Year 3 +: Continue monitoring. Year 5 +: Begin assessing data co llected to establish baseline. I. Recommended time frame for reviewing species status and trends Review strategy every 5 years. J.

Conservation objectives and actions State conservation and management needs: Gyrfalcon: Objective : Maintain Gyrfalcon populations in Alaska at current levels. Target: Maintain nesting habitat pr otections for Gyrfalcons. Measure: Monitor Gyrfalcons at known nesting sites. Issue: Lack of knowledge of popul ation status and trend. Conservation actions: a) Learn more about Gyrfalcon populations so we have baseline information on which to base decisions concerning conservation status and threats to populations; b) Develop reliable survey methods for remote, inaccessible species. c) Monitor nesting success at important sites at risk. d) Collaborate with falconers for mon itoring status and sharing data 481 Appendix 4, Page 260 Black Merlin: Objective : Maintain Black Merlin populations in Alaska at current levels. Target: Increase knowledge and information about population abundance of Black Merlins. Measure: Population and habitat monitoring. Issue 1: Lack of knowledge about natu ral history of this species. Conservation action: a) Obtain baseline information about Black Merlin ecology in Southeast Alaska. b) Evaluate relationships between fore st management and Black Merlins. c) Coordinate with other entities to un derstand merlin ecology throughout range. d) Develop practical survey method. Issue 2: Lack of knowledge concerning taxonomic status of Black Merlin as a subspecies or simply a color morph. Conservation action: In conjunction with natural hist ory studies, collect feathers and or tissue with which to begin to evaluate taxonomic status of this species. H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats Gyrfalcon: USFWS, NPS, ADF&G, and private entities (e.g., ABR, Inc. ) have expertise in the study of tundra raptors; use c ooperative partnership of raptor biologists to identify study objectives and survey areas in monitoring plans. Reports should be in the form of a report due at 5 years after plan implem entation, with annual summary reports (should not be required to be extensive). Black Merlin: Various state and federal agencies have raptor expertise, and they should use a coordinated approach in the st udy of this species along with ot her field studies. Reports should be in the form of a report due 5 y ears after plan implementation, with annual summary reports. I. Recommended time frame for reviewing species status and trends Review at 5 years. J.

Forest Owls - Introduction Forest owls occurring in Alaska are identified as featured species in the conservation plan because of several factors. These factors include: Forest owls are hard to detect, enumerate, a nd monitor. Therefore, we have very little knowledge about population size, status, and trend. Forest fragmentation is occurring, and we don't have reliable sta tistics on the rate change occurring in the forest types where these owls occur. Some owl species are negative ly impacted by forest frag mentation, but we don't know the threshold of fragm entation that causes impacts, nor do we know the magnitude of the impact in relation to the to tal range of these species in Alaska. Some owl species are enhanced by forest fragmentation, and we do not know the threshold of fragmentation that causes species to expand into new areas, nor do we know the magnitude of expansion in relation to the tota l range of these species in Alaska. Conserving common species is an important conservation strategy; however, the lack of knowledge about forest owl species ma kes it hard to identify the commonness of these owl species. Protecting vulnerable species is a core conservation strategy, yet lacking specific knowledge about forest owl species makes it difficult to identify strategies applicable to impacted species because we do not know which forest owl species are vulnerable or impacted. Forest Owls A. Species group description \"Forest Owls\" is a grouping of 8 little-know n species occurring in boreal forest (3 species) or temperate rain forest (4 species ) in Alaska. One species (Great Horned Owl) occurs in both forest types. Common names : Coastal temperate rain forest owls include: Western Screech-Owl, Northern Pygmy- Owl, Barred Owl, Northern Saw-whet Owl, and Great Horned Owl (also found in boreal forest) Boreal forest owls include: Great Gray Owl, Boreal Owl , Northern Hawk Owl, and Great Horned Owl (also found in coastal temperate rain forest) 483 Appendix 4, Page 262 Scientific names: Screech-Owl - Megascops Northern acadicus Strix nebulosa Boreal funereus Northern ulula Great Horned Owl - Bubo virginianus B. Distribution and abundance Range : Global range comments: See Birds of North America. Western Screech-Owl - Western North America - woodland and forest habitats; riparian deciduous; suburban. Northern Pygmy-Owl - New World - S outheast Alaska through the western cordillera to Guatemala. Barred Owl - New World - Southeast Alaska , central British Columbia eastward through southern Canada to New Brunswi ck and Nova Scotia, southward through most of the United States, into Mexico and Central America to Guatemala and Honduras; primarily in h eavily forested areas. Northern Saw-whet Owl - New World - woodlands and coniferous forests at moderate elevations and latitude. Great Gray Owl - Circumboreal - boreal forest and m ontane coniferous forest. Boreal Owl - Circumboreal - boreal forest and subalpine forest. Northern Hawk Owl - Circumbor eal - boreal forest and mixed deciduous/coniferous fo rest, burned areas. Great Horned Owl-New World-North and South America; di verse habitats and elevation. State range comments: Western Screech-Owl, Northern Pygmy- Owl, Barred Owl, Northern Saw-whet Owl - generally, breeding limited to South east and Southcentral Alaska (coastal temperate rain forest). Great Gray Owl, Boreal Owl, Northern Hawk Owl - generally, breeding in Southcentral and Interior Alaska (boreal forest). Great Horned Owl - generalist; throughout Alaska where trees or thick shrubbery are available. Abundance : Global abundance comments: See Birds of North America. Western Screech-Owl - no estimate of abundance (Cannings and Angell 2001); 740,000 worldwide; about 540,000 in North America (Rich et al. 2004). Northern Pygmy-Owl - 2,000 to 10,000 in Canada (Holt and Petersen. 2000); 100,000, about 84,000 in North America (Rich et al. 2004). Barred Owl -10,000-50,000 pairs in Canada (Mazur and James 2000); 560,000 (Rich et al. 2004). Northern Saw-whet Owl - 100,000-300,000 individuals (Cannings 1993); 2,000,000, with about 1,920,000 in North America (Rich et al. 2004). 484 Appendix 4, Page 263 Great Gray Owl - no estimate of abundance. Density: 0.66 to 1.72 pairs/km2 (Bull et al. 1993); 63,000, with about 31,500 in North America (Rich et al. 2004). Boreal Owl - no estimate of abundance (Hayward and Hayward 1993); 2,000,000, with about 600,000 in North America (Rich et al. 2004). Northern Hawk Owl - 10,000-50,000 individuals based on North America densities (Duncan and Duncan 1998) ; 130,000, with about 65,000 in North America (Rich et al. 2004). Great Horned Owl - no estimate of abundance (Houston et al. 1998); 5,300,000, with about 2,300,000 in North America (Rich et al. 2004). State abundance comments: unknown Trends : Global trends: see references Western Screech-Owl - declining due to habitat loss and invasion of Barred Owls (Cannings and Angell 2001). Northern Pygmy-Owl - unknown Barred Owl - expanding numbers and ra nge in western North America (Mazur and James 2000). Northern Saw-whet Owl - unknown Great Gray Owl - unknown Boreal Owl - Scandinavia - reduced numbers due to removal of forest (Hayward and Hayward 1993). Northern Hawk Owl - Anecdotal eviden ce of decline since 1800s; decline in Northern Europe (Duncan and Duncan 1998). Great Horned Owl - cycle with prey avai lability; increasing in disturbed areas (Houston et al. 1998). State trends: unknown C. Problems, issues, or concerns for species group Lack of knowledge about population status and trends. Current broad-scale bird survey methodologies (e.g., BBS, CBC) are generally lacking for owls and do not effectively monitor these species Habitat alteration and fragmentation (e.g., logging, urbani zation, mining) are occurring and impacts have not been assessed Contaminants may affect health and reproduction Disease (e.g., West Nile Virus) Since the 1970s, Barred Owls have been e xpanding into Alaska and they may be impacting other owl species D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Western Screech-Owl, Northern Pygmy-Owl , Barred Owl, Northern Saw-whet Owl: coastal, temperate rain fo rest - locally degraded. Northern Hawk Owl, Boreal Owl, and Great Gray Owl: boreal forest - good. E . Concerns associated with key habitats Lack of knowledge about species abundance and use of habitats Habitat alteration from logging, urbanization, and mining is occurring in both habitats (boreal forest, rain forest) 485 Appendix 4, Page 264 F. Goal: Ensure that forest owl populations remain sustainable throughout their range within natural population-level variation and hi storical distribution across Alaska. G. Conservation objectives and actions Objective : Maintain current population levels fo r forest owls in respective biomes. Target: For selected forest owls, identif y and obtain density estimates (e g . singing males/distance sampled). Measure: Index of abundance based on dens ity estimate methodology used (e.g., number of singing males during the breeding season per distance sampled). Issue 1 : Survey methods. There is a lack of knowledge about populati on status and trends because current broad-scale bird surv ey methodologies (e.g., BBS, CBC) do not effectively monitor owls. It is not clear wh at density of singing males is needed to conserve species, and it is unc lear if singing male method is an appropriate method to estimate abundance. Conservation actions: a) Develop and employ methodologies to measure populations accurately. b) Coordinate with existing owl monitoring groups to keep updated on changes or improvements in survey methods. c) Assess standard owl monitoring techni ques (e.g., singing surveys, playback surveys, monitoring of nest boxes). d) Based on assessment above, identify, employ and, if necessary, develop methods to determine abundance and trend. e) Develop methodologies for nonsingi ng, noncavity-nesting species. f) Investigate relationship between health of non-owl species that build nests that may also be used as nesting sites by owls. Issue 2 : Nest boxes. It is unclear how placement and occupancy of nest boxes relates to population status and dynamics. Artificial nest structures may enhance breeding opportunity for several species a nd/or create artificially high densities in formerly vacant habitat. Populations using nest boxes may not be reflective of larger metapopulations. Conservation action: Assess nest box checks as a sta ndard owl monitoring technique. Issue 3 : Lack of knowledge about species use of habitats. Conservation actions: a) Investigate habita t associations b) Conduct research to increase understandi ng of dependence on certain prey items, and what effect variations in prey abundance may have on owl populations c) Identify the spatial dispersion and physical features of suitable nesting cavities and surrounding vegetation types to include in conservation guidelines for forest managers. Issue 4 : Habitat modifications. It is unclear what amount of habitat change could negatively affect populations of these species. Conservation action: Assess potential status related to habitat change. 486 Appendix 4, Page 265 Issue 5 : Contaminants may affect hea lth and reproduction of owls. Conservation action: Assess potential threats from contaminants. Issue 6 : Disease, such as West Nile Virus, may affect health and reproduction of owls. Conservation action: Assess potential threats from disease. H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats Survey methods need development and 3-5 y ears will be needed to develop methods for assessing forest owl population status and trend for at least 2 species in each biome. I. Recommended time frame for reviewing species status and trends Five years from plan implementation. J. Bibliography Bull, E.L. and J.R. Duncan. 1993. Great Gray Owl ( Strix nebulosa ). In: A.

Snowy Owl - Introduction The rationale for featuring this species includes climate change and increasing human development (village growth and resource extr action) and the associated infrastructure, which may lead to changes in nesting of Snowy Owls. On the North Slope, Snowy Owls nest most reliably and are usually most abundant near the villa ge of Barrow. Near Barrow, numbers and reproductive effort of Snowy Owls are thought to be linked to abundance of brown lemmings, which varies co nsiderably from year to year. Anecdotal observations indicate that the periodicity and amplitude of brown lemming population fluctuations near Barrow may have changed in recent years. If so, this may affect Snowy Owl reproductive performance. Snowy Owl A. Species description description Common name : Snowy Owl Scientific name: Bubo scandiacus B. Distribution and abundance Range : Global range comments: holarctic and nomadic State breeding range comments: coastal tundra of north ern and western Alaska Abundance: Global abundance comments : irruptive (increase rapidly and irregularly in number) State abundance comments : irruptive Trends: Global trends : unknown State trends: unknown C. Problems, issues, or concerns for species Increased human presence in tundra areas (from village growth and expansion of development infrastructure and roads) ma y increase disturbance of Snowy Owls. Given their dependence on brown le mming populations, Snowy Owls may be impacted by changes in brown lemming popul ation ecology, which may in turn be impacted by global climate change. Snowy Owls may be representative of a broad array of Arctic Coastal Plain species that could be impacted by broad-scale environmental change. 488 Appendix 4, Page 267 Satellite telemetry data from work at Barrow suggests that Snowy Owls are a single Holarctic population. Effective management will need to address issues throughout the Arctic. D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Arctic tundra: very good but locally degrad ed, particularly immediately adjacent to Barrow where Snowy Owls habitually nest. Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta: very good but locally degraded. Aleutians and Bering Sea, winter habitat: very good. Beyond the borders of Alaska: unknown E. Concerns associated with key habitats Human disturbance on tundra, including recreational use around villages (both foot and vehicular) Human take by Siberian trappers (causi ng significant morta lity) needs to be relation to species charac teristics and distri bution (e g. single holarctic species) Broad-scale environmental changes (e.g., climate change) F. Goal: Ensure Snowy Owl populations remain sustainable throughout their range within natural population-leve l variation and historical distribution across Alaska. G. Conservation objectives and actions State conservation and management needs : Objective : Maintain sustainable numbers of Snowy Owls, within observed annual variability. Target: Ensure that Snowy Owls continue to nest in key habitats and locales. Measure: On the North Slope and other bree ding areas, use aerial waterfowl surveys as index of a bundance and distribution. Issue 1 : Tremendous natural annual variation in density and distribution may reduce the power of surveys to discern long-term population trends. Conservation actions : a) Use historic data to establish baseli ne detections and sample sizes to determine population trends. b) To monitor trends, repeat and expa nd the USFWS analysis of Snowy Owl abundance and distribution from aerial wa terfowl survey data (Arctic Coastal Plain Eider Survey, North Slope Wa terfowl Breeding Pair Survey). c) Cooperate with Canadian Wildlife Service to instit ute or expand surveys of Snowy Owls in Canada, including wate rfowl surveys in which Snowy Owl observations are recorded. d) Cooperate with Russian and European biologists working with Snowy Owls on Wrangell Island and elsewhere to estimate abundance and trend globally. 489 Appendix 4, Page 268 Issue 2 : Increased human presence in tundra area s (from village growth and expansion of development infrastructure a nd roads) may increase distur bance of nesting Snowy Owls, resulting in nest failures. Conservation action: Determine the effect on Snow y Owls of disturbance from human presence. Issue 3 : Snowy Owls are closely linked with prey species (e g., brown lemming) and may respond to climate change by being impacted by changes in availability and abundance of their primary prey. This species may be repres entative of a broad array of Arctic Coastal Plain species that could be impacted by broad-scale environmental change. Conservation action: Evaluate population dynamics of brown lemmings and other small mammals near Barrow related to envi ronmental change, including extrapolation to Snowy Owls and other Arctic Coastal Plain species. Global conservation and management needs : Objective : Ensure that Snowy Owls continue to nest in important nesting areas. Target: Use aerial surveys as index of abundance and distribution. Measure: Maintain numbers of Snowy Owls, within observed annual variability. Issue : Changes in the global climate may a ffect brown lemmings, the primary prey species of Snowy Owls, and could therefore reduce S nowy Owl numbers. Conservation action: Assess climatic change by inve stigating changes in Arctic habitats and winter sea ice conditions in relation to Snowy Owl distribution at the edge of the Arctic Ocean. H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats Annual aerial waterfowl surv eys on North Slope are curre ntly conducted by USFWS. Additional surveys (western Alaska, Ca nada) should be conducted annually. I. Recommended time frame for reviewing species status and trends Strategy should be reviewed after 5 years; additional information s hould be compiled in the meantime. J .

Seventy-three species of shorebirds have been record ed in Alaska, representing fully one-third of the world's shorebird species. Of these, 46 species have been documented breeding; 37 are regular breeders and 9 are irregular breeders or breed in small numbers (Gill et al. 1994, Gill and Senne r 1996). This incredible diversity is the result of Alaska's proximity to the major flyways of the world and the unique characteristics of the region's landscape , geomorphology, and vegetation (Kessel and Gibson 1978) . Most of these species migrate south of the U.S.-Mexico border and a third migrate to South America, Asia, or Oceania. Only a few species remain in Alaska throughout the year. The list of shorebird taxa restri cted wholly or in large part to Alaska is impressive. For example, most of the world's breeding populat ions of 3 species (Bristle-thighed Curlew, and Sandp iper) and 5 subspecies (Dunlin C. a. pacifica and C. a. arcticola; Rock Sandpiper C. p. ptilocnemis and C. p. couesi ; and Short-billed Dowitcher L. g. caurinus ) occur entirely within Alaska. As much as 75% of the world's breeding populations of Surfbird and a subspecies of the Rock Sandpiper ( C. p. tschuktschorum ) occur in the state. A large proporti on of North American populations of several other taxa also occur in Alaska, including Black Oystercatcher, Pacific C. c. roselaari ). Recent evidence suggests many shorebird sp ecies throughout the world are declining (International Wader Study Group 2003). Such d eclines are also occurring in North America. Indeed, of the 72 speci es and subspecies of shorebir ds addressed in the U.S. and Canada National Shorebird Plans, almost half (49%) have ex perienced apparent population declines since 1970. For many species, the relative status is poorly known and basic monitoring is needed. Outright loss of habitat is the cause of the population decline of many species; for others, it is less clea r what factors are res ponsible for the observed declines. To better ascertain the reasons for these declin es and to gather baseline data on species occurring in Alaska, the shorebird group sele cted 7 species to hi ghlight in and Solitary Sandpiper. Detailed conservation action plans for these species are presented separately. These 7 species exhibit a variety of life history patterns, ha ve population sizes that range from a few thousand to hundreds of thousands, and have popul ation trends that range from stable to possibly increasing to dramatically decreasing. We also relie d on a species prioritization process developed as part of the U.S. Shoreb ird Conservation Plan (Brown et al. 2001). That process is based upon factors such as: 1) population tren d and population trend uncertainty, 2) relative abundance, 3) thre ats during breeding seas on, 4) threats during nonbreeding season, 5) breeding distribution, and 6) nonbreeding distribution. The result of this process is an Alaskan conservation priority list that incl udes 2 taxa ranked as 491 Appendix 4, Page 270 highly imperiled and 17 ranked as of high c oncern. These species are covered in more detail in the Alaska Shorebird Conser vation Plan (Alaska Shorebird Group 2000). Beyond studying individual specie s, there are many conservati on needs that transcend a single species and are common to particular sh orebird groups or to all shorebirds. Several of these areas are outlined here. Alaska Shorebird Information and Data The first step in conserving wildlife is to understand what information is currently available on a given species or subject. Th ere is a need to develop an information clearinghouse, which would synthesize cu rrent information on the geographic distribution, abundance, and dyna mics of shorebird populations inhabiting the different regions of Alaska. This relational database would include information on where, when, and how studies were conducted, which specie s were present, counts or estimates of abundance, and other demographic information (e.g., nest initiation, success). The goal is to provide easily accessible web-based inform ation on Alaska's 73 species of shorebirds to a variety of interested part ies. It also could be used to identify information gaps and guide development of monitori ng and research programs. Clearinghouse information could be shared directly with the AKNHP , which is Alaska's statewide clearinghouse for information on plant and animal species of conservation concern, natural communities of conserva tion concern, and invasive nonnative plant species. AKNHP collects, validates, and distri butes this information, and assists natural resource managers and others in applyi ng it effectively. The AKNHP is part of NatureServe, and its data are linked to simila r programs in all 50 states, most Canadian provinces, and many Latin American countries. Monitoring and Assessment of Shorebird Populations Traditional methods of monitoring have been problematic for shorebirds, especially species that occupy remote bree ding areas, occur at very lo w densities, exhibit cryptic behavior near the nest, or fr equently forage well outside th eir nesting territory. For many of these species, an analysis of vital demographic rates may be a more practical approach to determine (1) which rates have the gr eatest effect on population size, (2) how populations might change with changes in vital rates, and (3) whether the status of these populations can be easily mon itored through the most sensit ive vital rates. For a few species, basic information on adult survival , age of reproduction, productivity, and annual recruitment is available or can be estimated from a sister taxon. Fo r other species, this basic information needs to be collected by conducting field studies. Due to the large ranges and migratory nature of many of these species, the ability to identify and assess changes in shorebird populations requires well-coordinated state, national, and international efforts. Within Alas ka, state, federal, and private organizations must work cooperatively to obtain objectiv es that transcend jurisdictional boundaries. Improved and coordinated monitoring of s horebirds would allow suspected population 492 Appendix 4, Page 271 trends to be confirmed and provide better estimates of the rates of change. This information, in turn, could be used to in form many important management decisions, including 1) detecting species at risk, 2) identifying cause s of population changes, 3) evaluating conservation and restoration programs, and 4) setting priorities for conservation of species and habitats. Respondi ng to this need, the U.S. and Canadian Shorebird Council's Monitoring Committee es tablished the Program for Regional and International Shorebird Monitoring (PRISM) in 2001 (Bart et al. 2002). This international program includes monitoring of shorebirds in the Arctic, boreal a nd montane regions of Alaska, as well as on migration stopover and staging sites throughout the coastal areas of the state. The following projec ts represent the first steps to fully implementing PRISM. (1) Arctic and Sub-Arctic Monitoring of Shorebirds A general approach for the Arctic surveys has been developed during the past 5 years (Bart and Earnst 2002). It uses double sampli ng and habitat-based models to estimate population size. (2) Development of Survey Methods for Monitoring Boreal-Nesting Shorebirds Currently, scientists lack an appropriate su rvey method(s) for boreal-nesting species. Primary methodologies that warrant evaluation are point count surveys and line transects that use distance estimation, double-sampling, and fixed- and rotary-winged surveys. Several species of shorebirds breed in the boreal region of Alaska, including 3 of known conservation concern and several (> 7) of unknown population status (Gill 1996; Alaska Shorebird Group 2000). (3) Inventory of Shorebirds Using State Critical Habitat A reas and State Game Refuges on the Alaska Peninsula Alaska Peninsula estuaries are extremel y important staging and stopover sites for autumn-migrant shorebirds that disperse to nonbreeding areas throughout the Americas, Oceania, and Australasia. Much less clear is the spatial and temporal extent to which shorebirds use these estuaries in spring. A study is needed to assess the relative importance of Bristol Bay estuaries and the adjacent terrestrial areas to spring migrant and breeding shorebirds. Such a study would f ill critical gaps in life history information for several species of conservation concern, such as the Marbled Godwit, whose nesting appears restricted to the Egegik Bay-Port Heid en portion of the Alaska Peninsula. It also would greatly facilitate efforts to implement species-specific, regional, and/or statewide monitoring programs to establish size and tr ends of Alaska shorebird populations. (4) Regional Assessments of Migratio n Stopover Sites for Shorebirds in Southcentral, Southeastern, and Northern Alaska The relative importance of intertidal mudf lats, estuaries, and wetlands along the Southcentral and Southeastern coast of Alaska as essential wildlife habitat to many animals, particularly migrating shorebirds, is undisputed (Isleib 1979; Senner et al. 1981). Many of these fall under state jurisdicti on. Also, research done during the Outer Continental Shelf Environmental Assessmen t Program in the mid 1970s (Connors et al . 1979, 1984) indicated that shorebirds changed habitat use from upland tundra breeding sites to coastal littoral staging areas as th e summer progressed. Virtually nothing is 493 Appendix 4, Page 272 known on how shorebirds aggregate along the coast and whether congregations in one area represent birds from adjacent tundra or from large areas of the coastal plain. A summary of the existing shorebird informa tion from these regions is needed. This includes a site descri ption, previous shor ebird abundance and diversity information, appropriate survey me thods, measurement error and bias concerns associated with counting shorebirds, and need for pilot studies to accurately count birds. This information, along with GIS land coverage of coastlines, could be used to identify other locations where shorebirds may stopove r during migration. The completed regional assessment will be an invaluable tool for regional biologists as they prioritize and plan future coastal studies and assess the potential effects of proposed habitat development projects. But most important, this document will provide the needed information, when combined with similar data from Canada a nd the contiguous United States, to develop a statistically sound sampling plan for estim ating shorebird abundance and population trends across the Pacific Flyway. Conservation Issues Affecting Shorebird Populations There are a number of natural and anthropogeni c factors that represen t real and potential threats to Alaskan shorebird populati ons and require further study. The 2nd edition of the Alaska Shorebird Conservation Plan (Ala ska Shorebird Group 2000) describes known and potential effects on shorebird populat ions from oil and gas development and infrastructure in Prince William Sound, Cook In let, Bristol Bay, and the Arctic Coastal Plain; marine transport of diesel fuel to coastal communities; marine-based recreation; mining; subsistence harvest; increased populations of nativ e and introduced predators; and climate change. It also identifies data gaps and information needs. Natural History of Shorebirds in Alaska For many species of shorebirds in Alaska, little is known about many aspects of their natural history. Detailed st udies are needed to documen t distribution and abundance, migration and staging patterns, physiology, population discreteness, and general breeding biology. Information on factors limiting the grow th of a population is particularly needed given the decline of many species. Natural history projects that also help address conservation issues presented above would be most helpful. In addition, several species of shorebirds reside in Alaska durin g the winter months, including the Black Oystercatcher, Surfbird, Black Turnstone and Pribilof Rock Sandpiper. These species occupy regions of Cook Inlet, Prince William Sound, Kodiak Island and Southeast Alaska. Virtually nothing is known about th e winter ecology of these species, where species winter relative to where they br eed, and whether seasonal movements of these birds occur. 494 Appendix 4, Page 273 Literature Cited Alaska Shorebird Group. 2000.

Species description Common name : Black Oystercatcher Scientific name : Haematopus bachmani Conservation designation: Classified as species of \"high concern\" within the United States (Brown et al. 2001), Canadian (Donaldson et al. 2001), and Alaska shorebird conservation plans (Alaska Shorebird Group 2004). Listed as bird of conservation concern within national and regions 1 and 7 lis ts of the USFWS, and is included in the Alaska Audubon Watchlist. B. Distribution and abundance (see map page 310, Appendix 4) Range: (from Andres and Falxa 1995) Global range comments: Generally resident throughout range that extends from Alaska to Baja California. Common throughout most of Aleutian Islands and coastal Southcentral Alaska, along outer coast of Southeast Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California, and along Pacific coast of Baja California south to Laguna San Ignacio. State range comments: In western Alaska common throughout Aleutian Archipelago west to Kiska Island and local ly in northern Bristol Bay. Most of population occurs in Southcentral Alaska where common thr oughout Kodiak Archipelago and east to Kenai Fjords National Park and to easter n Prince William Sound. Also regular along outer coast of Southeast Alaska. Occasiona lly found on Pribilof Islands in winter. Abundance : Global abundance comments: Estimated at 8900 individuals (Brown et al. 2001). State abundance comments: About 60% of the global population (5300 individuals) thought to reside in Alaska, mostly with in Kodiak Archipelago and east throughout Prince William Sound. Trends : Global trends: Thought to be stable but data limited. State trends: Within Prince William Sound, number of pairs have increased or remained constant between 1991 and 1998 (Murphy and Mabee 2000). A large population increase has occurred on Middleton Island since the late 1980s (Gill et al. 2004). C. Problems, issues, or concerns for species Oystercatchers are completely dependen t upon a narrow coastal area throughout their life cycle, where they are highly susceptible to direct a nd indirect (through long-term residues remaining in the intertidal areas) exposure to oil spills. Their strong fidelity to breeding territories, easy accessibility, cons picuous behavior, and limited reproductive 496 Appendix 4, Page 275 potential (at most 3 young raised per pair per year and a delayed maturation) also make them particularly vulnerable to local ex tirpation through persistent disturbance by predation and humans (Andres 1997, 1998). S ubsistence harvest of either breeding adults or eggs is a potential threat to some local populations of this species in Alaska. There is also increasingly disturbance by kayakers, fishermen, and tourists within Prince William Sound and Kenai Fjords National Park. D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Black Oystercatchers are obligate users of th e intertidal zone during their entire annual cycle. Here they obtain the necessary food resources for survival and reproduction. In many parts of their range, individual pairs may set up year-long territories or when migratory, exhibit rather high te rritory site fidelity among years. These factors make the species especially vulnerable to disturbance from marine industrial pollution (e.g., oil spills, waste discharge), huma n disturbance from tourism and fishing, and harvest or scientific collection. Long-ter m damage of intertidal areas may occur when oil residues remain in the sediments for years; this is especially relevant in cases where little washing of the area occurs through natural wave action. Within most of their range, habitat c onditions remain relatively pristine, although increasing human disturbance is occurring. In British Columbia, development of nearshore oyster farms and ot her aquaculture may hinder oy stercatchers from breeding. In Prince William Sound and Kenai Fjords, hum an tourism may make nesting sites less desirable despite little actual habitat alteration. E. Concerns associated with key habitats Marine pollution along coastal shorelines , which may directly kill adults and indirectly affect breeding pairs for years if oil residue remains in sediments within feeding territories. Increasing numbers of boaters, kayakers, fisherman, and campers in previously remote coastal areas of Alaska and British Columbia. Local extirpation of breeding pairs through subsistence harvest of adults or eggs, scientific collection, an d high predator numbers. Increasing numbers of wild and feral pred ators in nearshore areas, such as cats, dogs, foxes, ravens, gulls, rats, and livestock. F. Goal: Ensure Black Oystercatc her populations remain su stainable throughout their range within natural population-level variation and histor ical distributi on across Alaska. G. Conservation objectives and actions State conservation and management needs: Objective : Maintain sufficient habitat and population viability. 497 Appendix 4, Page 276 Target: Maintain territory occupancy and produc tivity levels at or above those documented in Prince William Sound in th e 1990s (these are most comprehensive data sets available). Conduct breeding and nonbreeding studies throughout range to determine vital rates necessary for bu ilding population viability models and evaluating effects of human disturbance. Measure: Assess changes in vital rates and de termine population trends in areas previously surveyed, and establish base line levels in new survey sites. Issue 1: Marine pollution along coastal shorelines. Issue 2: Increasing numbers of boaters, kayakers, fishermen, and campers in previously remote coastal areas may reduce nest ing propensity and reproductive success. Issue 3: Local extirpation of breeding pairs through subsistence ha rvest of adults or eggs, scientific collection, an d high predator numbers. Issue 4: Increasing numbers of wild and feral pred ators in nearshore areas, such as cats, dogs, foxes, ravens, gulls, rats, and livestock. Conservation actions: a) Determine vital parameters and sensitivity of each to stochastic and anthropogenic perturbations (e.g., o il spills, human disturbance). b) Determine importance of Southeast Al aska, Kodiak, Middleton Island, and Prince William Sound to postbreeding populations. c) Determine extent of postbreeding movements between breeding and wintering areas. d) Evaluate impacts from subsiste nce harvest on adults and eggs. e) Promote development of outreach and e ducational information to inform the public (recreational boaters and campers, local hunters, and pet owners) on the effects of disturbance, subsistence harvest, and introduced predators. Global conservation and management needs: Objective : Conserve sufficient habitat to ensure population sustainability. Target: Maintain territory occupancy and pr oductivity levels at or above those documented in British Columbia and coastal western states (these are most comprehensive data sets available). Measure: Assess changes in vital rates and determine population trends in areas previously surveyed, and establish base line levels in new survey sites. Issue 1: Marine pollution along coastal shorelines. Issue 2: Increasing numbers of boaters, kayakers, fishermen, and campers in previously remote coastal areas may reduce nest ing propensity and reproductive success. Issue 3: Increasing numbers of wild and feral pred ators in nearshore areas, such as cats, dogs, foxes, ravens, gulls, rats, and livestock. Issue 4: Increasing levels of coastal devel opment may hinder or enhance habitat. 498 Appendix 4, Page 277 Conservation actions : a) Determine extent of postbreeding movements between breeding and wintering areas. b) Determine population size and trends in breeding areas. c) Evaluate impact of feral and wild pr edators on oystercatcher adult survival and productivity. d) Determine vital parameters and sensitivity of each to stochastic and anthropogenic perturbations (e.g., o il spills, human disturbance). e) Support implementation of the Black Oystercatcher Working Group to promote collaboration on nati onal and international level. f) Promote development of outreach and e ducational information to inform the public on the effects of disturba nce and introduced predators. g) Promote identification and protection of key areas th rough collaborations with NGOs and state and federal entities. H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats Surveys should be conducted at key breed ing and nonbreeding sites once every 5 years to evaluate population abundance and status. Given that much of the intertidal area is under state jurisdiction, funding and some logistical and personnel support to conduct surveys should come from the State of Alaska. The USFSW, the Canadian Wildlife Service, the USGS, as well as other stat e and provincial governments throughout the species range should contribute funds and personnel to conduct surveys. I.

Species description Common name : Lesser Yellowlegs Scientific name : Tringa flavipes Conservation designation: Considered a \"species of m oderate concern\" in both the U.S. Shorebird Conservation Plan (Brown et al. 2001) and the Alaska Shorebird Conservation Plan (Alaska Shorebird Group 2004). However, significant population declines (4-9% per year) identified recentl y in NABBS data (Sauer et al. 2003) has generated a higher level of concern for this species. B. Distribution and abundance (see map page 311, Appendix 4) Range: (from Tibbitts and Moskoff 1999) Global range comments: Breeding range extends from western Qu\u00e9bec to western Alaska and from southern portions of the Prairie Provinces to northern MacKenzie. Nonbreeding range extends along the Atlantic Coast from southern New Jersey to southern Texas; and the Pacific Coast from San Francisco Bay to southern California and at the Salton Sea. Widespread on the mainland of Mexico down through southern Panama. Also winters in We st Indies and throughout S outh America to Chile and Argentina. Most birds migrate via the Ce ntral Flyway in spring and fall and on the Atlantic Coast in fall. Widespread elsewh ere in North America during migration but in low numbers. State range comments: In Alaska, breeds throughout the area bordered by Anaktuvuk Pass in the north, Kobuk River in northwest, Sheenjek Valley in northeast, Situk River Flats in southeast, and Innoko National Wildlife Refuge in west. 500 Appendix 4, Page 279 Abundance : Global abundance comments: Cumulative totals of birds at fall staging areas and aerial surveys on nonbreeding areas sugge st the population numbers about 500,000 birds (Morrison et al. 2001). However, this species is difficult to census accurately because of its tendency to disperse over large areas. State abundance comments: Alaska breeding populati on thought to be about 150,000 birds (Alaska Shorebird Group 2004). To date , no comprehensive effort has been made to quantitatively estimate the size of the Alaska population. Trends : Global trends: Steep decline of 9% per year ( P = 0.00, N = 28 routes) between 1980 and 2002 along NABBS routes in Ca nada (Sauer et al. 2003). State trends: Similar trend in NABBS data from Alaska, where an estimated annual rate of decline of 4% ( P = 0.06, N = 37 routes) has occurred during this same time period. C. Problems, issues, or concerns for species Existing Lack of practicable methods to census Lesser Yellowlegs throughout their annual cycle Lack of information about regions and sp ecific habitats prefe rred by this species in the Neotropics Lack of information about ha bitat preferences in Alaska Alteration and loss of nesti ng habitat in boreal region Alteration and loss of wetland habitats throughout nonbreeding range Potential Pesticides and other contaminants may be ingested by Lesser Yellowlegs in habitats they commonly use on nonbreeding grounds, including estuaries, flooded agricultural fields, and sewage lagoons Habitat change, especially drying of boreal wetlands D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Breeding: Breeds primarily in boreal forest an d forest/tundra transition habitats. Typical nesting area in Alaska contains a combination of shallow wetlands, trees or shrubs, and open areas. Habita t at nesting areas has been described as open or semi- open forest interspersed with marshes, bogs, ponds, lakes, and sedge meadows. Foraging : During breeding, forage mostly in sma ll boreal forest wetlands nearby nest areas (e.g., ponds, flooded woodlands, creek bank s). Birds nesting near the coast forage in salt marsh ponds. Nesting birds will make daily foraging flights between boreal nest sites and nearby wetlands (up to 13 km away ). Vegetated intertidal areas appear important to migrants in Alaska. 501 Appendix 4, Page 280 E. Concerns associated with key habitats Boreal forest habitats are be ing altered and lost at increa sing rates; effects of climate change uncertain. Wooded wetlands in Cent ral and South America continue to be altered at considerable rates. Attributes surrounding species success: Dispersed distribution during breeding insulates this species from local disturbance events (e.g., road construction, fire). F. Goal: Ensure Lesser Yellowlegs populations remain sustainable throughout their range within natural population-level variation and histor ical distributi on across Alaska. G. Conservation objectives and actions State conservation and management needs: Objective : Maintain sufficient habitat and population viability. Target: Reverse downward trend in population si ze estimated with the NABBS route data by 2010. Measure: Document number and geographic coverage of off-road surveys relative to species' breeding distribution. Compare the abil ity of different survey techniques to accurately estimate breeding pair densities. Issue 1: Lack of statistically valid and logistically feasible methods to census and evaluate productivity of Lesser Yellowlegs during breeding and stag ing; measurement of this objective may be difficult. Issue 2: Alteration and loss of nesting habitat in boreal region from human development. Issue 3: Habitat change, especially drying of boreal wetlands Conservation actions: a) Verify accuracy of existing trend da ta in Alaska and implement more intensive off-road surveys. b) Identify causes of the apparent decline. c) Develop, test, and implement a statis tically valid statewide monitoring protocol for boreal forest shoreb irds, including Lesser Yellowlegs. d) Quantify nesting, adult feeding, and brood-re aring habitat in gr eater detail to learn what types of habitat or habita t complexes are required for successful reproduction. e) Develop feasible options for tracking changes in habitat using remote sensing methods. f) Quantify differences in breeding density and breeding success among habitats. g) Monitor changes in the extent and primary productivity of boreal forest wetlands. h) Advocate for policies and conservation planning that protects Lesser Yellowlegs habitat. 502 Appendix 4, Page 281 Global conservation and management needs : Objective : Conserve sufficient habitat and population sustainability. Target: Assess rate of wetland habitat loss and exposure to contaminants on nonbreeding grounds. Expand off-road BBS routes and implement other techniques for enumerating Lesser Yellowlegs by 2007. Measure: Determine known rates of habitat lo ss and levels of contaminant exposure. Estimate population trend usi ng new and improved survey methods. Issue 1: Lack of statistically valid and logistically feasible methods to survey Lesser Yellowlegs throughout their annual cycle. Issue 2: Lack of information about regions and sp ecific habitats prefer red by this species in the Neotropics. Issue 3: Alteration and loss of wetland hab itats throughout nonbreeding range. Issue 4: Pesticides and other contaminants may be ingested by Lesser Yellowlegs in habitats they commonly use on nonbreeding grounds, including estuaries, flooded agricultural fields, and sewage lagoons. Conservation actions: a) Assess the accuracy of BBS populat ion trend data by testing and implementing methods. b) Identify causes of the apparent decline. c) Develop, test, and implement a statistic ally valid monitoring protocol for Lesser Yellowlegs during nonbreeding season. d) Document regions and habitats us ed by species in the Neotropics. e) Evaluate extent and rate of wetla nd habitat loss in nonbreeding areas. f) Evaluate exposure to cont aminants on nonbreeding grounds. H. Plan and time frames for monito ring species and their habitats Develop and implement statistically valid and logistically feasible survey method(s) by 2008. Monitor changes in the extent and primar y productivity of boreal forest wetlands and evaluate effects on Lesser Yellowle gs by 2010. Potential partners include municipalities, ADF&G, DNR, BLM, various Native regional and vi llage corporations, USFWS, and the USGS. Add itional support from the State of Alaska to conduct surveys on state lands, which cover most of th e suspected breeding range, is especially needed. Fieldwork should be planned with the Boreal Partners in Flight groups who are working extensively in boreal regions of North America. The difficulty in developing a reliable census technique for this sp ecies is significant. Periodic review is needed to determine if monitoring and survey recommendations are unrealistic and in need of revision. Mon itoring via a population index, as opposed to estimating actual population, may prove to be a more attainable goal. 503 Appendix 4, Page 282 By 2010, initiate studies on nonbr eeding areas to investigate the distribution and habitat use by yellowlegs and assess the potentia l for the species to be exposed to contaminants. Continue to evaluate and improve survey methods on nonbreeding grounds. Federal, state, provincial, nongovern mental organizations, and Native villages and regional corporations throughout the species range should contribute funds and personnel to assess these objectives.

Species description Common name : Solitary Sandpiper Scientific name : Tringa solitaria (T. s. cinnamomea race population cons \"highly continental of high concern\" in U.S. Shorebird Conservation Plan (Brown et al . 2001). The species is also a bird of conservation concern on the national and regi on 6 lists of the USFWS. All designations are based on the extremely small population estimate, rapid rate of population decline (4.1%) in Alaska Breeding Bird Survey data, and the uncertainty about the accuracy of these estimates. B. Distribution and abundance (see map page 312, Appendix 4) Range: Global range comments: Species breeds across the bor eal forests of Alaska and Canada. Nonbreeding range extends from southeast Texas and Sinaloa, Mexico, throughout Central America, and south to Pe ru, Bolivia, and south-central Argentina. Most birds migrate via the Central Flyway and are broadly dispersed in fall and somewhat more concentrated (in time and space) in spring. State range comments : Nests from within 25 km of the Bering Sea in western Alaska east to the Alaska/Canada border, and from the northern Alaska Peninsula north to the Brooks Range. Probably migrates across a broad front in small flocks (<10 birds) or singly. Areas of concentration not yet id entified for migrants or postbreeders. T. s. cinnamomea breeds in boreal forests of Alaska (Moskoff 1995). Abundance : Global abundance comments: Species population estimated at about 25,000 birds (Morrison et al. 2001), but quality of estimat e poor and may be several times larger. State abundance comments: T. s. cinnamomea population estimated at only 4000 individuals (Brown et al. 2001) . If accurate, this estimate indicates that the Alaskan- breeding race is among the rarest shorebirds in North America. Trends : Global trends: Very little data, but recent analyses indicate downward trends in all data sets that have sufficient information to investigate such tr ends (i.e., NABBS in Alaska, NABBS in Canada, and migrant monitoring in Ontario and Quebec). Although not statistically significant, NABBS data from Canada show an annual rate of decline of 10% between 1966 and 1999 (P = 0.13, N = 12 routes). Point estimates of trend for migrant birds in both Ontario and Quebec between the late 1970s and the late 1990s are also negative, but neither approaches signifi cance (Aubry and Cotter 2001; Ross et al. 2001). 505 Appendix 4, Page 284 State trends: Breeding Bird Survey data from Al aska since 1980 show a significant population decline of 4.1% per year ( P = 0.02, N = 20 routes; Sauer et al. 2003). This suggests that the Alaskan population ( T. s. cinnamomea) today is only about a third the size of a quarter century ago. C. Problems, issues, or concerns for species Existing Paucity of information about population status and trends Lack of workable methods to survey Solitary Sandpipers throughout their annual cycle Lack of information about regions and sp ecific habitats prefe rred by this species in the Neotropics Lack of information about ha bitat preferences in Alaska Loss of nesting habitats to logging in boreal forests Loss of nonbreeding habitats to logging in tropical woodlands Loss of wetland habitats thr oughout the species distribution Decline in other species whos e nests this species uses Potential Pesticides and other contaminants Habitat change, especially dr ying of boreal forest wetlands D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Breeding: Wooded wetlands in muskeg bogs, spruce forests, and deciduous woodlands (Moskoff 1995), occasionally riparian tall shrub thickets. Postbreeding and staging: Same as breeding but also uses nonwooded wetlands such as margins of large lakes and coastal salt marshes. Nonbreeding: Does not occur in Alaska during this period. Habitats used within suspected nonbreeding range include wooded wetlands, intertidal mudflats, mangrove swamps, flooded ricefields, estuaries, and riverbanks. E. Concerns associated with key habitats Effects of climate change are uncertain. Boreal forest habitats are be ing altered and lost at increa sing rates, particularly in Canada. Wooded wetlands in Central and South America have undergone considerable alteration and loss. Attributes surrounding species success: Dispersed distribution during all phases of annual cycle protects this species from local catastrophic events (e.g., oil spills). Only low levels of human disturba nce likely experienced by this species duri ng breeding and postbreeding periods. F. Goal: Ensure Solitary Sandpiper ( T. s. cinnamonea ) populations remain sustainable throughout their range within natural popul ation-level variation and historical distribution across Alaska. 506 Appendix 4, Page 285 G. Conservation objectives and actions (applies only to T. s. cinnamomea ) State conservation and management needs: Objective : Maintain sufficient habitat and population viability. Target: Reverse downward trend in population size estimated with the BBS route data by 2010. Measure: Document number and geographic coverage of off-road surveys relative to species' breeding distribution. Compare the abil ity of different survey techniques to accurately estimate breeding pair densities. Issue 1: Lack of statistically valid and logistically feasible methods to survey and evaluate productivity of Solitary Sandpipers during breeding and staging; measurement of this objective may be difficult. Issue 2: Alteration and loss of nesting habitat in boreal region from logging and other human development. Issue 3: Habitat change, especially drying of boreal wetlands. Issue 4: Decline in other species (e .g., Rusty Blackbird) whose nests this species uses. Conservation actions: a) Verify accuracy of existing trend da ta in Alaska and implement more intensive off-road surveys. b) Identify causes of the apparent decline. c) Develop, test, and implement a statis tically valid statewide monitoring protocol for boreal forest shorebirds, including Solitary Sandpipers. d) Quantify nesting, adult feeding, and brood-re aring habitat in gr eater detail to learn what types of habitat or habita t complexes are required for successful reproduction. e) Develop feasible options for tracking changes in habitat using remote sensing methods. f) Conduct population viability analysis to identify important vital rates regulating population. g) Quantify differences in breeding density and breeding success among habitats. h) Monitor changes in the exte nt (i.e., loss of habitat due to logging) and primary productivity of boreal forest wetlands. i) Assess relationships with those passerine species th at provide the nesting substrates for the Solitary Sandpipers. j) Advocate for policies and conservation planning that protects Solitary Sandpiper habitat. Global conservation and management needs: Objective : Maintain sufficient habi tat and population viability. 507 Appendix 4, Page 286 Target: Assess rate of wetland habitat loss and exposure to contaminants on nonbreeding grounds. Expand off-road BBS routes and implement other techniques for enumerating Solitary Sandpipers by 2007. Measure: Determine known rates of habitat lo ss and levels of contaminant exposure. Estimate population trend usi ng new and improved survey methods. Issue 1: Lack of statistically valid and logistically feasible methods to census Solitary Sandpipers throughout th eir annual cycle. Issue 2: Lack of information about regions and sp ecific habitats prefer red by this species in the Neotropics. Issue 3: Alteration and loss of wetland hab itats throughout nonbreeding range. Issue 4: Solitary Sandpipers may ingest pesticides and other contaminants in habitats they commonly use on nonbreeding grounds including estuaries, flooded agricultural fields, and sewage lagoons. Conservation actions: a) Assess the accuracy of BBS populat ion trend data by testing and implementing survey methods. b) Identify causes of the apparent decline. c) Develop, test, and implement a statistic ally valid monitoring protocol for Solitary Sandpipers during the nonbreeding season. d) Document regions and habitats used by subspecies in the Neotropics. e) Determine extent of postbreeding movements between breeding and nonbreeding areas, using population geneti cs, stable isotopes, and mark- recapture studies. f) Evaluate extent and rate of wetla nd habitat loss in nonbreeding areas. g) Evaluate exposure to cont aminants on nonbreeding grounds. H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats Develop and implement statistically valid a nd logistically feasib le survey method by 2008. Monitor changes in the extent and primar y productivity of boreal forest wetlands and evaluate effects on Solitary Sandpipe rs by 2010. Potential partners include ADF&G, DNR, BLM, various Native regional and village corporations, USFWS, and the USGS. Additional support fr om the State of Alaska to conduct surveys on state lands, which cover most of the suspecte d breeding range, is especially needed. Fieldwork should be planned with the Boreal Partners in Flight groups who are working extensively in boreal regions. The difficulty in developing a reliable census technique for this sp ecies is significant. Periodic review is needed to determine if monitoring and survey recommendations are unrealistic and in need of revision. Mon itoring via a population index, as opposed to estimating actual population, may prove to be a more attainable goal. By 2010, initiate studies on nonbr eeding areas to investigat e the distribution, habitat use, and potential for contaminant exposure to the species. Continue to evaluate and 508 Appendix 4, Page 287 improve survey methods on nonbreeding ground s. Federal, state, provincial, and nongovernmental organizations, and Native villages and regional corporations throughout the species range should contribu te funds and personnel to conduct these objectives.

Species description Common name : Bristle-thighed : Audubon Society's Watch Li st; a species of high conservation concern within U.S. Shorebird Conservati on Plan (Brown et al. 2001); a bird of conservation concern on the national and region 7 lists of the USFWS; and one of top 3 species of concern by Alaska Shorebir d Group (Alaska Shorebird Group 2004). All designations based on small population size , limited breeding range, and concern over threats on the nonbreeding gr ounds (Marks et al. 2002). B. Distribution and abundance (see map page 313, Appendix 4) Range: (from Marks et al. 2002) Global range comments: Restricted range species with nesting confined to 2 relatively small, disjunct regions of western Alaska and recent evidence of genetic separation between birds inhabiting the 2 breeding areas (J. Gust, USGS, unpubl.). Nonbreeding range on other hand possibly largest of any avian species, encompassing south-central Pacific Ocean from the Hawaiian Archipela go south to Pitcairn Island and east to west from the Marquesas Is lands to the Marshall Islands . Only migratory shorebird found exclusively on atolls and island s during nonbreeding season. Listed as \"Vulnerable\" by Wetlands International ow ing to small and supposedly declining population size and predation by exo tic mammals on nonbreeding grounds. State range comments: Nesting restricted to nort hern Seward Peninsula and Andreafsky Wilderness of southwest Norton Sound. Postbreeding birds stage on coastal portions of central and southern Yukon-Kuskokwim River Delta. Birds occasionally common in spring on Alaska Peninsula estuaries; rare but annual in north Gulf of Alaska in spring. Abundance : Global abundance comments: Population is among smallest of all shorebirds with estimated size (including nonbreeding suba dults) at 10,000 indivi duals (Waterbirds International 2002). State abundance comments: Comprehensive survey of known breeding range from 1988 to 1989 yielded about 3200 breeding pairs with 60% in Nulato Hills portion of Andreafsky Wilderness and 40% on Seward Peninsula. Trends : Global trends: Numerous lines of evidence suggest the population is being negatively affected by anthropogenic factors on th e nonbreeding grounds in central Oceania. Average number of birds declined steadily between 1988 and 2000 at a site in the northern portion of the range ; however, site is on norther n edge of nonbreeding range and used by comparatively few birds. 510 Appendix 4, Page 289 State trends: Replication of 1988-1989 survey in 1999-2000 resulted in too much variation to assess trend over this decade. C. Problems, issues, or concerns for species Existing Exotic predators on nonbreeding grounds Subsistence hunting throughout ra nge. (Uncertainty about the specific identity of \"large shorebirds\" harvested in wester n Alaska raises the possibility that subsistence harvest in Alaska may al so be a threat to this species.) Small genetically effective population size Potential Road construction and increased human access to Seward Peninsula Increase in natural predators (Common Ravens Corvus corax ) associated with human landfill practices in western Alaska Contaminants on nonbreeding grounds D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas (from Marks et al. 2002; Alaska Shorebird Group 2004) Breeding: Rolling hills (50-500 m elevation; slopes 3-10%) covered with upland tundra; lower parts of drainages with medium to tall (1.2-2.4 m) shrubs, and upper elevations (ridges and slopes) with extr emely short vegetation and/or bare ground. Northern breeding area occurs on north-cent ral Seward Peninsula from Kougarok River west to Ear Mountain. Most of this region is state-owned or Native-selected land with some federal inholdings managed by the BL M. Entire region site of active mineral (mostly gold) extraction efforts with asso ciated roads, trails, and site-based infrastructures. Southern breeding area largely within Andreafsky Wilderness Area within Yukon-Delta National Wildlife Refuge . Species relatively secure on breeding range because of extremely low nesting dens ity and general inaccessi bility of the area to humans during this season. Postbreeding Staging: Entire breeding population t hought to stage on outer Yukon- Kuskokwim Delta from Scammon Lagoon sout h to Kuskokwim River. Most birds restricted to dwarf-shrub t undra, graminoid meadows, and mosaic of tundra/meadow habitat. Unknown proportion of Seward Peni nsula breeding populat ion moves to coast of southern Seward Peninsula before moving on to Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. Annual variation in standing crop of fruits of black crowberry and ericaceous shrubs appears major determinant of habitat use. Bird s rarely found on unvegetated, soft-substrate intertidal habitats. All staging habitats are generally pristine. Nonbreeding: Uses wide variety of habitats on islands and atolls, including tidal mudflats, marshy areas, edges of mangrove swamps and lagoons, reefs, saltpans, channels among islets, beaches, forb mats , and human-created habitats (airport runways, lawns, Cocos \"forests,\" other open areas). Most birds found at sea level in these habitats but on high volcanic islands also occasionally found in meadows up to 800 m elevation. Condition of habitats varies from very degraded to pristine, with most little altered by humans. 511 Appendix 4, Page 290 E. Concerns associated with key habitats Breeding habitats on Seward Peninsula hi storically the focu s of several mining initiatives with current effort largely a f unction of world market prices. Associated infrastructure, namely roads, has allowed human access to the southern portions of the breeding range. Off-road vehicles and use of tracked vehicles in support of mining operations have in places caused significant degradation of tundra habitats. Proposed new roads and extraction of road materials from within breeding range could affect breeding distribution. No known threats to habitats on southern breeding area or postbreeding staging areas on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. Habitat modification severe in many parts of nonbreeding range, but degradation per se probably not as important to curlews as pred ation by introduced mammals. Attributes surrounding species success : Most breeding and stagi ng habitats are either remote, pristine, and/or within conserva tion units. Relatively few, but critical, nonbreeding sites also designated as cons ervation units. Natural history traits, especially extent of disp ersal during breeding and nonbreed ing seasons, likely buffer adverse affects of small-scale habitat degradation. F. Goal: Ensure Bristle-thighed Curlew populati ons remain sustainable throughout their range within natural population-level variation and histor ical distributi on across Alaska. G. Conservation objectives and actions State conservation and management needs: Objective : Maintain sufficient habitat and population sustainability. Target: Maintain a minimum of 1280 and 1920 breeding pairs on the Seward Peninsula and Nulato Hills, respectively (C. Handel et al. in Marks et al. 2002). Measure: Improve (i.e. increased number of su rvey sites) previously established surveys. Conduct surveys on 3 breeding areas every 5 years. Use new satellite imagery and other GIS-based tools to qua ntify changes in habitat availability. Issue 1: Financial and logistical cons traints for conducting surveys. Issue 2: The species' complex life history strategies, including extremely low nesting densities and low detection probabilities during breeding, have hampered efforts to achieve above objective. Issue 3: Road construction and increased human access to Seward Peninsula. Issue 4: Increase in natural predators (Common Ra vens) associated with human landfill practices in western Alaska. Issue 5: Poor reporting of subsistence harvest during breeding and staging (e.g., poor identification of \"large shorebirds \" and inadequate survey coverage). Conservation actions: a) Conduct surveys on breeding and staging areas. b) Develop demographic models to evaluate which vital rates are most important in regulating population size. 512 Appendix 4, Page 291 c) Evaluate habitat damage associated with human access and development, and work with stakeholders to minimize and mitigate effects. d) Evaluate effect of artificially enhanced populations of predators on reproductive success and survival of species. e) Evaluate extent and impact of subs istence harvest throughout annual cycle. f) Implement education initiatives throu ghout species' range, particularly in relation to human development and subsistence harvest. Global conservation and management needs: Objective : Maintain sufficient habita t and population sustainability. Target: Partition and visit nonbreeding grounds to evaluate species presence and use, habitat alteration and pred ator effects, and obtain blood samples for population genetic structure. Measure: Document the location and number of islands/atolls (i.e., percentage of nonbreeding grounds) visited over the next 10 years. Issue 1: Exotic predators. Issue 2: Insufficient surveys. Issue 3: Contaminant exposure. Issue 4: Lack of information on stopover sites and nonbreeding distribution. Issue 5: Poor international collaboration throughout Oceania. Conservation actions: a) Determine population structure thro ughout nonbreeding grounds and link nonbreeding areas to discre te breeding populations. b) Evaluate impact and control of exotic predators on nonbreeding grounds. c) Evaluate effective and genetic population sizes. d) Identify areas throughout nonbreeding range that host large numbers of birds. e) Identify migratory stopover sites south of Hawaiian Archipelago. f) Assess levels of heavy metal contamina tion to birds using certain islands in the Northwestern Hawaiian Archipelago. g) Implement international efforts to prot ect and manage key nonbreeding areas, including active removal of exotic animals. h) Implement education initiatives to make indigenous people aware of impacts of introducing exotic predators and disturbing natural habitats throughout nonbreeding grounds. H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats Survey methodologies are in place for obt aining population indices on breeding and staging areas. This work was conducted th rough a collaborative effort between the USGS and the USFWS. Add itional support from the ADF&G to conduct surveys on state lands, which cover a large portion of the Seward Peninsula, is needed. All 3 partners should promote outreach with local communities. 513 Appendix 4, Page 292 I.

Species description Common name : Marbled Godwit Scientific name : Limosa fedoa ( L. f. beringiae subspecies breeds only on the Alaska Peninsula, see below) Conservation designation: Species of High Conservati on Concern in the U.S., Canadian, and Alaska shorebird conservation plans because of declining population trend and threats on breedi ng grounds (Brown et al. 2001; Donaldson et al. 2001; Alaska Shorebird Group 2004). .L. f. beringiea represents a geographically and morphologically distinct popul ation. Also a bird of c onservation concern on the national and Region 7 lists of the USFW S and is included on the National Audubon Society's Watch List. B. Distribution and abundance (see map page 314, Appendix 4) 514 Appendix 4, Page 293 Range: Gratto-Trevor 2000) Global range comments: The species breeds only in North America in 3 disjunct areas: (1) majority in gra sslands of northern United St ates and southern Prairie Provinces of Canada, (2) small population also along coast of southwest James Bay, Ontario, and (3) equally small population on northern Alaska Peninsula, Alaska. During the nonbreeding season, it is found along the Pacific coast from southwest British Columbia (where rare) south to El Salvador with most occurring from Washington to Baja California. Also in this region found inland in interior California (Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley and Salton Sea). Rare, local visitor to Pacific coast of Costa Rica, Panama, Columbia, Ecuador, and Chile. Also rare, local and irregular in nonbreeding season along immediate Atlant ic coast from about Massachusetts south to Virginia but regular and more numerous from North Carolina south to Florida, and west along coast of Gulf of Mexico to northern coast of Yucatan Peninsula. Uncommon along Atlantic coast of Venezuela. State range comments: Nesting confirmed only from the Ugashik Bay area, but suspected of breeding in 100 by 50 km area fr om just north of Ugashik Bay south to Port Heiden. Common migrant in spring along coast of Southeast Alaska (e.g., Yakutat Forelands), but rare Prince Willia m Sound and Cook Inlet, suggesting spring migrants cross north Gulf of Alaska to Al aska Peninsula. Prio r to nesting, fairly common on intertidal ha bitats of Ugashik Bay and Cinder-Hook Lagoon. Postbreeding birds also common on these estuaries as well as at Egegik Bay and Port Heiden, occasionally south to Nelson and Izembek lagoons. L. f. beringiae population thought to spend nonbreeding season al ong coast of Washington, Oregon, and northern California. Abundance : (from Gratto-Trevor 2000; Morrison et al. 2001) Global abundance comments : Species population estimated at between 140,000 and 200,000 birds. State abundance comments: L. f. beringiae population estimated at 3000 individuals and among smallest of all North America shorebird populations. Estimate derived from scattered, non-systematic counts of postbreeding birds on Alaska Peninsula estuaries; extent of breeding range of L. f. beringiae population poorly defined, and no population assessment has been ma de during the breeding season. Trends : Global trends: Historically few data, but the speci es had a larger breeding range and population before 1900 (Page and Gill 1994). Breeding range no longer includes Wisconsin, Iowa, Nebraska, and much of Minnesota. Slight increasing trend in numbers since 1950s in Florida and Caro linas, possibly also Washington coast. Trends from Breeding Bird Survey routes indicate no overall changes in Canada and U.S. prairie populations from 1966 to 1996. Numbers in United States increased slightly but significantly; t hose in Canada remained the same. Numbers in North Dakota did not change si gnificantly from 1967 to 1992-1993. State trends: No information. 515 Appendix 4, Page 294 C. Problems, issues, or concerns for species Existing Subsistence hunting Small population size and restricted breeding range makes species vulnerable to local extirpation Potential Pesticides and other contaminants Loss of nonbreeding habitat to aqua culture development (Mexico) Loss of wetland habitats used during migration Sea level rise Indirect and direct effects from oil spills in Bristol Bay Habitat change, especially intertidal habita ts of Alaska Peninsula estuaries altered in conjunction with developm ent of oil and natural gas D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas (following for L. f. beringiae subspecies only) Breeding: Lowland areas inland from immediate coast from just north of Pilot Point south to Cinder-Hook Lagoon. \"Preferred\" area s (additional study need ed) composed of marsh/very wet bog and wet bog/wet meadow habitats dominated by moist-bluejoint, moist-sedge meadows, scattered willows 1-2 m tall, and scatte red ponds. Apparently not found in shrub-graminoid habitat that predominates in this region. All known and suspected nesting habitats are pristine. Postbreeding Staging: Entire breeding population thought to move to intertidal habitats of Alaska Peninsula estuaries, pr imarily Egegik and Ugashik Bays and Cinder- Hook Lagoon with juveniles lingering into late September. Birds also recorded at Seal Islands, Port Heiden, and occasionally Nelson and Izembek Lagoons. Unknown to what extent Kvichak and Nushagak Bays used following nesting. No other Alaska sites known to support this taxon during this period. Migration of both adults and juveniles thought to entail direct fli ght across Gulf of Alaska to nonbreeding areas. All habitats used during postbreeding pe riod appear in very good to pristine condition. Nonbreeding: Does not occur in Alaska during this period. Habitats used within suspected nonbreeding range of L. f . beringiae include coastal mudflats, adjoining savannas or meadows, estuaries, sandy b eaches and sandflats; sometimes roosting at salt ponds. Significant historic degradation or loss of estuarine habitats along Pacific coast. Existing habitats a mixture from pris tine to highly degrade d, with most having been altered to some extent. 516 Appendix 4, Page 295 E. Concerns associated with key habitats Breeding habitats remote and pristine, but extremely small population size and propensity to occur in flocks increases taxon's susceptibility to environmental perturbations. Proposal for road construction along the Alaska Peninsula could directly affect nesting habitat, and may increase illegal harvest. Contamination of benthic foods from oil spills likely, while birds themselves prone to direct oiling of plumage. Sea level rise from global climate change lik ely to alter food web and structure of nonbreeding foraging habitats. Attributes surrounding species success: Alaska breeding habitat pristine but only small proportion within conser vation units. Known major postbreeding sites are within conservation units, mostly those administered by of the State of Alaska. Little human disturbance during breeding and postbreeding periods. F. Goal: Ensure Marbled Godwit ( L. f. beringiae ) populations remain sustainable throughout their range within natural popul ation-level variation and historical distribution across Alaska. G. Conservation objectives and actions (for L. f. beringiae only) State conservation and management needs: Objective : Conserve sufficient habitat to ensu re population sustainability across the natural range of the species. Target: Define the breeding range and determin e the size of the breeding population by 2007. Measure: Range maps and population estimates generated based on GIS-based habitat model and extensive on-ground sampling. Issue 1: Breeding is confirmed for only a single localized site, yet observations during nonbreeding periods suggest the breeding range is more extensive. Issue 2: Very small population that may be vulnerable to local extirpation. Issue 3: Legal subsistence harvest of Bar-taile d Godwits may result in accidental mortality. Issue 4: Habitat change, especially intertidal habitats of Alaska Peninsula estuaries altered in conjunction with deve lopment of oil and natural gas. Conservation actions: a) Conduct ground surveys in potential breeding range and nearby areas to estimate population size and habitat use. b) Assess and refine habitat-bird model developed previously. c) Acquire conservation designa tion for breeding habitat. d) Link use of Alaska Peninsula estuaries by nonbreeding birds to specific nesting areas. e) Determine extent of area used in Alaska during nonbreeding periods. f) Determine extent of illegal harvest, and promote outreach to reduce accidental take. 517 Appendix 4, Page 296 Global conservation and management needs: Objective : Conserve sufficient habitat to ensu re population sustainability across the natural range of the species. Target: Establish geo- and habitat-referen ced bounds on nonbreeding area(s) of the L. f. berengiae population. Measure: Site use and range will be established using radiotelemetry, resightings of individually marked bird s, and genetic analysis. Issue 1: Birds that breed in Alaska are susp ected of spending the nonbreeding season along the coast from Washington to northern California, but th is has yet to be confirmed. Issue 2: Effective conservation requires that all areas and habitats be identified throughout a species' annual cycle. Issue 3: Potential exposure to pesticides and ot her contaminants on nonbreeding grounds in Mexico and Canada. Issue 4: Potential loss of nonbreeding habitat to aquaculture development (Mexico). Issue 5: Loss of wetland habitats used during migration. Conservation action: a) Identify nonbreeding areas outside Al aska and encourage appropriate conservation designation. b) Over portions of nonbreeding range in Me xico and Canada conduct studies to evaluate contaminant exposure and effects of aquaculture development. c) Determine southward migration strategy. d) Evaluate effective and genetic population sizes. H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats By 2007, conduct survey of breeding range to assess habitat use and population size. Assess use of Alaska Peninsula estuar ies by pre- and postbreeding populations. Potential partners include ADF&G, DNR, BLM, various Na tive regional and village corporations, USFWS, USGS, and University of Alaska. Additional support from the State of Alaska to conduct surveys on stat e lands, which cover most of the suspected breeding range, is especially needed. By 2008, determine extent of nonbreeding range from data collected through techniques involving analyses of stable isot opes, genetics, and marked birds. Federal, state, provincial and nongovern mental organizations, and Na tive villages and regional corporations throughout the species' range should contribute funds and personnel to accomplish these objectives.

Species description Common name : Rock Sandpiper (Pribilof Sandpipe r, Aleutian designation: Nominate race considered popul ation of high conservation concern in U.S. Shorebird Conservation Plan (Brown et al. 2001) and Alaska Shorebird Conservation Plan (Alaska Shorebird Group 2004). B. Distribution and abundance (see map page 315, Appendix 4) Range: (from Gill et al. 2002) Global range comments: North Pacific Ocean centered on Bering Sea (from Japan Archipelago north through Commander, Al eutian, and central Bering Sea Islands; mainland from southern Kamchatka Peninsula, coastal Chukotsky Peninsula, coastal Alaska from northern Seward Peninsul a south throughout coastal Yukon-Kuskokwim River Delta and Alaska Penins ula; and also among islands of western Gulf of Alaska. In nonbreeding season south of normal limit of sea ice from central Alaska Peninsula, throughout Aleutian Archipelago, Gulf of Al aska (including Cook Inlet), and North Pacific south to northern Calif ornia and Japan Archipelago. State range comments: Generally nonmigratory with seasonal movements (some pronounced) regulated by severity of c onditions during the nonbreeding season. Abundance : Global abundance comments: 150,000 (Morrison et al. 2001), Wetlands International (2002). State abundance comments: Alaska estimated at < 150,000 individuals as of 2003 ( C. p. ptilocnemis <20,000; C. p. couesi 75,000; C. p. tschuktschorum 50,000). Trends : Global trends : Largely unknown. CBC data from Paci fic Northwest suggests decline in nonbreeding season population of C. p. tschuktschorum (Buchanan 1999 in Gill et al. 2002). State trends: Unknown. 520 Appendix 4, Page 299 C. Problems, issues, or concerns for species Existing Alteration of nesting hab itat on Bering Sea Islands from introduced ungulates, mostly reindeer (effects on Ro ck Sandpiper populations unknown) Predation on nesting birds, eggs, and young from exotic animals (foxes, rats) in Aleutian Archipelago Potential Oil spills Habitat change, especially intertidal habitats D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Breeding: Coastal lowland tundra at elevations seldom higher than a few hundred meters above sea level. Most nesting hab itat pristine (except on Bering Sea Islands) and within designated conservation lands (Nati onal Wildlife Refuges and State of Alaska Critical Habitat areas and Game Refuges). Roosting : Typical of most intertidal-foraging shoreb irds in that species forms roosts at high tide. Roosts invariably formed immediat ely adjacent to intertidal areas on exposed rocky, cut bank, and sandspit shorelines. Will readily roost on man-made structures such as piers, wharfs, jetties, and riprap. Foraging : During breeding, forages mostly on tundra, but if nesting in proximity to intertidal habitats will make foraging flights between tundr a and intertidal areas; during nonbreeding period forages on various intertidal habitats (rock, grav el, soft-substrate, vegetated). Vegetated intertidal areas appear important in ea rly spring when birds arrive on breeding grounds and nonvegetated intertidal habitats still mostly covered in ice. E. Concerns associated with key habitats Contamination of benthic foods from oil spills and to lesser extent from direct oiling of plumage. Areas most likely to be affected include Cook Inlet and Br istol Bay estuaries. Sea level rise from global climate change likely to alter food web and vegetative structure of breeding and fo raging habitats (see above). Attributes surrounding species success: Most of North American breeding habitat pristine and within conser vation units. There is genera l awareness by industry of environmental responsibilities associated w ith oil and gas development in Cook Inlet and Bering Sea; spill response and efficacy is a key for this and other intertidal species. General lack of human disturbance th roughout all phases of annual cycle. F. Goal: Ensure Rock Sandpiper populations rema in sustainable throughout their range within natural population-leve l variation and historical distribution across Alaska. G. Conservation objectives and actions S tate conservation and management needs: Objective : Maintain sufficient habita t and population sustainability. 521 Appendix 4, Page 300 Target: Substantiate and maintain population estimates determined during recent surveys. Measure: Base-line assessments would be made for each subspecific population and repeated at 5-year intervals. Use remote imagery and ground-truthing to assess habitat change caused by reindeer. Issue 1: Lack of rigorous assessments of populati on size for 2 subspecies (Aleutian and Northern). Issue 2: Impacts of reindeer on habita t use unknown (Pribilof Islands). Issue 3: Impacts of fox and/or rat predati on on distribution an d productivity (all subspecies). Issue 4: Oil and gas development in Cook Inlet. Conservation actions: a) Determine size structure and levels of genetic variation among subspecific populations of Rock Sandpiper. b) Maintain genetic viability am ong all subspecific populations. c) Evaluate impacts of fox and/or rat pr edation on distribution and productivity, and if necessary, promote or conduct removal of predators. d) Evaluate potential direct and indirect impacts from oil and gas development, including assessing the background leve ls of hydrocarbon contaminants in birds and their prey in Cook Inlet. e) Elevate awareness and continue protecti on of critical habitat areas throughout range. (ADF&G is the key land manager in all 7 major estuaries on the Alaska Peninsula, as well as major portions of the nonbreeding sites used in Cook Inlet.) f) Continue existing local surveys and c onduct periodic rangewide surveys to assess the size, status, and tre nd of the various populations: Determine vital parameters and sens itivity of each population to natural and anthropogenic perturbations (e.g., oil spills, extreme cold events). Assess impacts to habitat quality from reindeer grazing on Bering Sea Islands. Determine importance of Alaska Pe ninsula estuaries to postbreeding populations of the nominate subspecies. Determine extent of postbreeding movement among all subspecific populations. Global conservation and management needs: Objective : Maintain sufficient habitat and popul ation sustainability of the northern subspecies. Target: Develop and implement an international management plan. Measure: Document number of studies being conducted, lands under new protection, and international collaborations. 522 Appendix 4, Page 301 Issue 1: Lack of information on population size and distribution, including breeding range. Issue 2: CBC data in British Columbia and Washington have identified a decline in population size, although extent of decline throughout population unknown. Issue 3: Threats have not been identified in Russia. Conservation actions: a) Determine proportion of population that breeds in Russia. b) Identify key breeding areas and pr omote conservation designation and management. c) Encourage population surveys on nonbr eeding grounds in coastal Alaska, British Columbia, and Washington. H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats A breeding population assessment was recently completed for the Pribilof subspecies. This survey should be replicated at 5-year intervals with support from the USGS, USFWS, and Native villages and regional corporations. New surveys are needed for the Aleutian and Northern subspecies on Alaska Peninsula, Aleutian Archipelago, and western Alaskan. Po tential partners for these surveys are USGS, USFWS, ADF&G, NPS, and various Na tive villages and regi onal corporations. Surveys on nonbreeding sites are needed th roughout the Aleutians, in Lower Cook Inlet, Prince William Sound, and from the Alaskan Panhandle through British Columbia to Washington state. Potential partners include the USFWS, USFS, NPS, USGS, Canadian Wildlife Service, provincial government of British Columbia, and Native villages and regional corporations. Th e State of Alaska is the principal land custodian for areas used by these taxa during the nonbreeding season (postbreeding through winter) and thus has a disproportiona te responsibility for ensuring these tasks are accomplished.

Species description Common name : Buff-breasted Sandpiper Scientific name : Tryngities subruficollis Conservation designation: as \"near threatened\" (IUCN 2003). Included in Appendix I (migratory species that are endangered) of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of W ild Animals (CMS 2005), and classified as \"high concern\" in both the U.S. (Brown et al. 2001) and Canadian (Donaldson et al. 2001) shorebird conservation plan s. Listed as bird of c onservation concern on USFWS's national and Region 7 lists. Also listed as \"vulnerable\" in Brazil's Red Data Book and on the list of Official Endangered Species for Rio Grande do Sul State (Fontana et al. 2003; Decreto Estadual 41.672, 11 de junho de 2 002 - the endangered species list for the state.). B. Distribution and abundance (see maps pages 316-318, Appendix 4) Range: (from Lanctot and Laredo 1994 range comments: High Arctic (66\u00b0-76\u00b0 N) in cluding Alaska, Yukon (Herschel Island, Blow River to Clarence Lagoon), M ackenzie (Anderson Rive r to Horton River, Franklin Bay, Rasmussen Basin Lowlands), Banks Island (south of Bernard River, Sach's Harbor, De Salis Bay), Melville Isla nd (Polynia Lake, Winter Harbor), Bathurst Island (Cape Cockburn, Polar Bear Pass) , Devon Island (Truelove Lowland, Cape Sparbo), Victoria Island (Cambridge Ba y, Prince Albert Sound, Richard Collinson Inlet), Jenny Lind Island, King William Island, Prince of Wales Island (Crooked Lake), Boothia Peninsula (Wrottesley Valle y), and Somerset Island (Creswell River; see references in Lanctot and Laredo 1994; Figure 3.23). Historic information and more contemporary data indicate that the main wintering range of the species is within the coastal sectors of the Rio de La Plata Grasslands, at the ea stern portion of the Flooding Pampa of Argentina, and adjacent to large lagoon complexes in the coastal plain of Rio Grande do Sul of Brazil a nd Uruguay. Incidental sightings during the nonbreeding season were also reported in th e remaining portions of the Rio de La Plata Grassland (subregions of the rolling pampa, inland pampa, southern pampa, mesopotamic pampa). Smaller numbers have also been observed in saline lagoons of the Puna Ecoregion of Argentina and Boliv ia, and the Central Trough of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil (see Lanctot et al. 2002, Figure 3.24). State range comments: Primarily east of Point Barrow along the coastal portion of the Alaska Coastal Plain, but also observed n ear Cape Woolley, Seward Peninsula in western Alaska (see Gotthardt and Lanctot 2002, Figure 3.25). Much of the potential breeding area has not been adequately surveyed. Abundance : Global abundance comments: Estimated at between 15,000 and 25,000 individuals (Brown et al. 2001; Morrison et al. 2001). State abundance comments: 20-25% of global population or 3000 to 6250 individuals (Alaska Shorebird Conservation Plan 2004). 525 Appendix 4, Page 304 Trends : Global trends : Thought to be declining based on d eclines observed in local areas on breeding, migration, and nonbreeding sites. State trends : Number of adults seen during surveys on breeding grounds varies dramatically on an annual basis; breeding density (nr./km2) in Alaska varied from 0 to 10 during 1971-1974 (Bergman et al. 1977) and 0.5-14.0 from 1981 to 1989 (average = 5.7; Troy and Wickliffe 1990). Once listed as an abundant species at Point Barrow in the late 1880s and is now rarely seen there. C. Problems, issues, or concerns for species (from Gotthardt and Lanctot 2002 and references therein) Habitat loss/Degradation of habitat: Conversion of native gras slands or pastures to agriculture and suburbs along the migration corridor has result ed in an enormous loss of habitat for upland shorebirds. Grassland areas th at have been preserved in the United States are frequently managed for species preferring tall grass, and as such do not have historic levels of grazing required to mainta in shorter vegetation prefe rred by Buff-breasted Sandpipers. Pampas grasslands on the nonbreed ing grounds also have been lo st to agricultural row crops. In addition, the development of mines and fore st plantations in Brazil, construction of buildings and roads for tourism in Uruguay, and the subdivision of hacienda s (i.e., ranches) in Argentina all threaten to degrade upland habitats that this species pref ers. Cattle ranching on the nonbreeding grounds has transformed grassla nd communities from taller tussock grasses to shorter grasses and dicots, possibly resulting in an expansion of the nonbreeding range of Buff-breasted Sandpipers. On the nonbreeding grounds the majority of the grasslands visited by Buff-breasted Sandpipers are located within privately owned ranches. Few of these sites are legally protected. Land management practices in unprotected areas ar e subject to change with global and regional economic constraints. The introduction and m ovement of livestock (e.g., cattle, horses, and sheep) at a local and regional level could have profound effects on the distribution and abundance of this species. Increased protection of these \"key\" nonbreeding areas is needed, and adequate livestock grazing patterns must be maintained to ensure the conservation of this species. The remaining nonbreeding range is unlikely to be converted to agriculture because of flooding and saline conditio ns near the coast, although these areas have the potential to be developed as beach resorts, mines, and pine plantations. Sensitivity to disturbance at nest and roosting sites. The development and extraction of oil and gas resources in northern Alaska and Canada may affect the species. These developments are frequently sited in drier upland habitats to a void impacting wetlands, but as a result alter habitats typically used by Buff-breaste d Sandpipers. The availability of garbage around development sites and Ar ctic communities may increase predator populations, and be indirectly re sponsible for higher predatio n of nests and juveniles by species such as Arctic fox ( Alopex Buff-breasted Sandpiper number s declined dramatically in the late 1800s and early 1900s due to market hunting. This sp ecies was hunted most heavily in the central United States and to a le sser degree on the South American nonbreeding grounds. Since 1918, this species has been protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act in the United States and in Canada. Currently, hunting of Buff-breasted Sandpipe rs is thought to be minimal or nonexistent throughout their range. 526 Appendix 4, Page 305 Pesticides and other contaminants: Exposure to pesticides and herb icides used on lands frequented by Buff-breasted Sandpipers dur ing migration may pose a threat to the species. Such lands include agricultural fiel ds (e.g., rice and alfa lfa), sod and stubble fields, golf courses, airport runways, and cemeteries. Buff-breasted Sandpipers may use these nonconventional, man-alterated habita ts because the major ity of short-grass prairies are destroyed. Native prairies pres erved today are frequently managed as tall grass prairies making them unavailable to this species. Buff-breasted Sandpipers may also be exposed to organochlorines in rice fields on the nonbreeding grounds. Furthermore, natural grasslands in the Rio de La Plata Grassland are being increasingly plowed and replaced by sown pastures that are supplemented with imported fertilizers and other agrochemicals. Such chemical e xposure may cause individuals to die. Three adult Buff-breasted Sandpipers died from f eeding on planted rice seed treated illegally with Furadan 4F in Calhoun County, Texas, in 1983. Death of other sandpipers species (Calidris mauri and C. melanotos) has been at tributed to exposure to Furadan 3G, a rice pesticide closely related to Furadan 4F. Pes ticide exposure has been implicated in the decline of other upland species in South Am erica. Sublethal doses of pesticides can reduce survival, growth, and reproduction rates in birds. D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas (from Lanctot and Laredo 1994; Lanctot et al. 2002; Gotthardt Habitat: Breeding restricted to tundra ecor egion. Habitat use depends on sex and breeding stage; males display in first s now-free areas, typically along barren ridges, creek banks, and raised, well-drained areas with reticulat e-patterned ground and scant vegetation. and Eriophorum angustifolium as dominant vegetation types. Display areas tend to be on non-patterned ground with closely spaced tussocks about 20 cm high and 25-50 cm in diameter, often with dwarf willow thickets (Salix glauca and S. lanata). Nests are on dry slopes with numerous sedge tussocks, on moss-willow-varied grass tundra, and in moist or wet sedge-graminoid meadows on non-patter ned or strangmoor (series of aligned tussocks) ground. Females on incubation break s found primarily along streambanks in non- and reticulate-patterned ground with scant vegetation. Females with broods are seen primarily in moist and emergent vege tation along or in streambeds. Buff-breasted Sandpipers are considered part of the \"upland species\" guild because of their dependence on drier, sloping areas or tundra with many pol ygons. This species is also one of the few shorebird species that do not show a pronounced seasonal shift toward lowland, wet (ponded) si tes during brood-rearing. The majority of Arctic-nesting habitat is in pristine condition, although continuing development of natural resources on the Arct ic Coastal Plain is leading to habitat degradation. Nonbreeding Habitat: Buff-breasted Sandpipers are ty pically found in pasturelands that are being grazed by livestock and are very short (2- to 5-cm tall). The species is found less frequently in agriculture (e.g. rice) and abandoned fields. In Brazil and Uruguay, Buff-breasted Sandpipers were found almost exclusively in heavily grazed grasslands along the margins of salt and fres hwater lagoons. Birds detected in Argentina were in very large pastures that were part of large ranches and we re not restricted to lagoon margins. 527 Appendix 4, Page 306 Most of the sites identified as being key nonbreeding areas in this study are privately owned, and few are legally protected. Fortunately, these areas are unlikely to be converted to agriculture because of flooding and saline conditions near the coast. However, these areas are likely to be fl ooded should global warming lead to higher water levels. Further, large fluctuations in the proportion of land devoted to cropping and animal husbandry in the Rio de la Plata Grassland has occurred during the past 20- 30 years. These changes appear to be directly related to th e price of beef and grain. Other forms of development, such as mines and pine plantations in Brazil, construction of roads and buildings for tourism in Braz il and Uruguay, and the subdivision of ranches in Argentina, may also have a negative e ffect on the species. Development of coastal beaches for tourism in Uruguay is also a threat. The introduction and movement of livestock at a local and re gional level may indirectly have strong within- and among- year effects on the distribution and abundan ce of Buff-breasted Sandpipers. Pastures may never become suitable if livestock are m oved too frequently among pastures (i.e., to minimize overgrazing), introduced too late in the austral summer, or removed altogether. Overall nonbreeding habitats appear to be of suitable quantity now, but degradation is occurring slowly throughout their winter range. Migration Habitat: Buff-breasted Sandpipers frequent short-grass areas such as pastures, burned grasslands, sodfields, golf c ourses, cemeteries, airports, and lawns. The species is also found along damp margins of freshwater lakes, ponds, and lagoons. Buff- breasted Sandpipers use a variet y of agricultural fields, including recently plowed or cut alfalfa fields or fields of newly planted or emerging rice, cotton, and potatoes. In South America, birds are in recently harvested a nd burned sugar cane fields of Surinam; in open, dry fields with short grasses in Brazil; and on dry sa ndbars in rivers. Natural short-grass prairies occur rarely as management tends to favor species that prefer tall grass prairies, and the use of bison and other he rbivores to maintain short grass heights is uncommon. Much of the human-altered habitat is under constant change, as farmers manage agricultural la nds according to thei r resources and the regional agricultural economics. Overall, mi gration habitat appears to be the most degraded and appropriate habitat is not be ing provided by current management regime. 528 Appendix 4, Page 307 E. Concerns associated with key habitats (from Lanctot and Laredo 1994; Lanctot et al. 2002; Gotthardt and Lanctot 2002). Nesting Habitat: Oil and gas development on the Arctic Coastal Plain may decrease the suitability of drier upland habitats and lead to increased predation on nests and young. Nonbreeding Habitat: The reliance of Buff-breasted Sandpipers on old and new rice fields on their nonbreeding grounds in Sout h America may expose the species to herbicides and pesticides. Natural grasslands in the Rio de La Plata Grassland are being increasingly plowed and repl aced by sown pastures supplemented with fertilizers and other agrochemicals. While most pastur eland along the coast is unsuitable for conversion to agriculture, ot her forms of development, such as mines and pine plantations in Brazil, construction of road s and buildings for tourism in Brazil and Uruguay, and the subdivision of ranches in Arge ntina, may also decrease the suitability of the habitat for the species. Migration Habitat: Buff-breasted Sandpipers may be also exposed to agrochemicals along their migration route in the United St ates. Here the species frequents altered habitats such as golf courses, sod fields, ai rport runways, cemeteri es, and newly planted rice fields that are subject to he rbicide and pesticide applications. F. Goal: Ensure Buff-breasted Sandpiper populati ons remain sustainable throughout their range within natural population-level variation and histor ical distributi on across Alaska. G. Conservation objectives and actions State conservation and management needs: Objective : Conserve sufficient habitat and population sustainability. Target: Evaluate state trend in population size and increase accuracy of population estimate by developing habitat-based models to identify suitable breeding sites and extrapolating population density estimates. Measure: Repeat target (see above) on 5-year intervals. Issue 1: Lack of data on breeding distribution and population size. Issue 2: Artificially enhanced numbers of predat ors and increasing development on Arctic Coastal Plain. Issue 3: Unpredictable and sporadic o ccurrence in breeding locations. Conservation actions: a) Determine breeding distribution and population size. b) Document potential impacts from predators and human development. c) Develop habitat-based model to predic t distribution on Arctic Coastal Plain. d) Educate policy makers on impacts of development on the \"upland\" birds. e) Evaluate contaminant exposure to birds breeding in Alaska. 529 Appendix 4, Page 308 Global conservation and management needs : Objective : Conserve sufficient habitat and population sustainability. Target: Maintain population size at levels recorded in 1999 and 2001 on the nonbreeding grounds. Measure: Conduct population surveys on nonbreeding grounds at 5-year intervals. Issue 1: Potential contaminant exposure duri ng migration and on nonbreeding grounds. (The species frequents altered habitats such as golf courses, sod fi elds, airport runways, cemeteries, and newly planted rice and other agricultural fi elds where pesticides and herbicides are commonly applied.) Issue 2: Habitat loss through agricultural conversion on wintering grounds. Issue 3: Effect of livestock management regimes on habitat availability. Issue 4: Inadequate funding in South Am erica to do conservation studies. Conservation actions: a) Capture and test a minimum of Buff-br easted Sandpiper adults for exposure to organophosphorus and carbamate pestic ides on migration and nonbreeding sites. These studies are inappropriate in Alaska as birds either die or metabolize chemicals prior to arriving in the state. b) Evaluate impacts of livestock mana gement practices on habitat use on nonbreeding grounds. c) Evaluate impacts from human deve lopment on habitat availability on nonbreeding sites. d) Develop international partnerships a nd manage species on a flyway basis. e) Repeat population surveys on nonbreeding grounds every 5 years. H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats Initial survey of population conducted on nonbr eeding range over 2-ye ar period in 1999 and 2001. Such surveys should be conducted onc e every 5 years to determine population stability. Intensive surveys should be conducted at key nonbreeding habitat sites identified in previous surveys. The difficulty in developing a reliable census technique for this sp ecies is significant. Periodic review is needed to determine if monitoring and survey recommendations are unrealistic and in need of revision. Mon itoring via a population index, as opposed to estimating actual population, may prove to be a more attainable goal. I. Recommended time frame for reviewing species status and trends Given the small size of the species population, we recommend revi ewing and revising the strategy every 5 years, or at more fr equent intervals in response to additional information. Plan should be prepared in conjunction with the Alaska Shorebird Group and revision of its Alaska Shorebird Conservation Plan. 530 Appendix 4, Page 309 J. Bibliography Alaska Shorebird Group. 2004.

The lack of observations from an area does not indicate the area does not have Buff-breasted Sandpipers as many areas have not been searched, and the species occurs sporadically from year-to-ye ar (from Gotthardt and Lanctot 2002). 540 Appendix 4, Page 319 Landbirds - Introduction Alaska is home to 135 species of breeding birds that principally use terrestrial habitats throughout the year. These birds, commonly referred to as \"landbirds,\" compose the largest and most ecologically diverse component of Alas ka's avifauna and include raptors, grouse, woodpeckers, warblers, and sparrows, among others (Boreal Partners in Flight 1999, Alaska Raptor Management Program 2001 1). Collectively, landbirds occupy all terrestrial habitats in Alaska, where they play vital roles in ecosystems by feeding on insect pests, pollinating plants, dispersing seeds, serving as prey, and acting as top pred ators. They also provide important functions to the people of Al aska by helping define our culture and contributing to our economy. The Willow Ptarmigan, for example, serves as the state bird, a traditional source of f ood for Alaska Natives, and an important prey item for many predators. Moreover, the economies of many communities throughout Alaska are bolstered by the thousands of bird watchers who visit the state each summer to view the many species of landbirds found nowhere else in North America. In order to maintain these contributions to the ecosystems and peopl e of Alaska we must sustain viable and well distributed populations of these birds in the state through time (Boreal Partners in Flight 1999). Fundamental to achieving th is goal is an understanding of the relative vulnerabilities of species and subspecies to range reductions and extinctions and using this information to focus limited resources on ta xa most in need of conservation (Rich et al. 2004). In April 2004, a group of experts met to identify landbird prio rity species and conservation issues for the next 10 years. Th e group reviewed information on the relative vulnerabilities of Alaskan landbirds based on population size, restri ctions on distribution, threats to populations, and population trend (Bor eal Partners in Flight 1999; Rich et al. 2004) and identified the following landbird taxa and taxa groups as the most important for conservation: 1. Aleutian and Bering Sea island endemic la ndbird species and subspecies (p. 357); 2. Smith's Longspur (p. 363); 3. Landbirds sensitive to forest management (p. 328); and 4. Landbirds with long-term declines in populat ion size (p. 322), with the Olive-sided Flycatcher (p. 336), Blackpoll Warbler ( p. 342), and Rusty Blackbird (p. 350) species of particular concern within the group. Specific goals and recommendations for conser vation were developed for these birds and are included in the CWCS. The expert pa nel also recognized, however, that many additional conservation issues will need to be addressed in Alaska in order to keep our common landbirds common (Handel 2000). In add ition to the birds and issues listed 1 A separate group of experts addressed raptors (eag les, hawks, falcons, and owls) because of their specialized conservation needs (Alaska Raptor Management Program 2001). However, we included in our discussion 2 game species, grouse and ptarmigan, because the conservation needs of these birds were not addressed by any management plan in the state, and several populations are either undergoing rangewide population reductions or are threatened by current land management practices in Alaska. 541 Appendix 4, Page 320 above, and the priorities noted in the Landbird Conservation Plan for Alaska Biogeographic Regions (Boreal Pa rtners in Flight 1999), landbird conservation in Alaska will be advanced if the following issues are addressed over the next 10 years: Assessing the changing status of Alaska's landbirds \u2014Although several landbird species have been highlighted in this plan beca use of documented dec lines, there is still extremely limited information on the changing st atus and trends of most of Alaska's 135 species of breeding landbirds. In particular , few are adequately monitored by any of the current monitoring programs in North Ameri ca. Thus, we greatly need more effective community and species-specific inventory and monitoring programs for landbirds in Alaska to establish baselines of population si ze for future comparison, identify key areas and habitats for conservation, and detect population declines before species become imperiled. Conservation of landbird taxa with sma ll population sizes and restricted ranges \u2014 Extremely vulnerable to threats are those bi rds with small populations and restricted ranges. Although Smith's Longspur and the ende mic species and subspecies of Aleutian and Bering Sea Islands fall into this category and are addressed in templates in the plan, several other landbird taxa have ranges in North America that are entirely or largely restricted to Alaska. Additional taxa that shoul d be of conservation focus in this category are: 1) a unique group of Paleotropic-Nearctic migrants in Alaska, including the Alaska endemic breeding Arctic 2) \"subspecies\" largely restrict ed to Southeast Alaska, such as the Spruce Grouse on Prince of Wales Island ( Falcipennis canadensis isleibi, Dickerman and Gustafson 1996); and 3) resident species co mmon in Eurasia but restricted to Alaska in North America, such as Gray-headed Chickadee ( Poecile cincta concern. Its nonmig ratory habits suggest that it might be genetically isolated from conspecifics in th e Palearctic. If this is the case, the North American population is nearly an Alaskan e ndemic with only a sma ll part of its range extending into the Yukon and Northwes t Territory. Although little population information is available, the species appears to be rare, and is at least partly reliant on isolated cottonwood stands north of the limits of spruce forest. Protecting landbirds from large-scale threats \u2014In addition to forest management, several other factors threaten Alaska 's landbird populations and shou ld be carefully studied and managed in order to conserve our birds. Global warming may be the number one future threat to birds in the region as current mode ls predict large changes to important avian habitat. Such potential changes include shrinkage of boreal wetlands as well as substantial alterations to wi nd and weather patterns that may significantly increase the energetic costs of migration fo r our long-distance migrants. A short list of other threats includes accumulation of persistent organic po llutants, outbreaks of diseases such as West Nile virus and bill defo rmities, and the cumulative impacts of resource and urban development. Conserving important nonbreeding habitats outside of Alaska \u2014Approximately 75% of Alaska's breeding landbird species winter outside of the state (Boreal Partners in Flight 542 Appendix 4, Page 321 1999). Thus, efforts are needed to ensure th at the conservation needs of our birds are being met along important migration pathways and wintering areas beyond our borders. Because the ranges of Alaska's migrant bi rds are not confined by political borders, considerable coordination among states, provin ces, and countries is needed to advance rangewide conservation for our birds.

Species group description This group includes Alaska landbird taxa experiencing significant ( P < 0.15) long-term declines ( > 1.5% population decline per year for 10 year s or more) in their breeding range, including or excluding Alaska. This template is meant to generally address the conservation of Alaskan landbirds with documented declines, but also accommodates species which are later found to have declines within the next 10 year s. Monitoring of landbird populations in Alaska largely began in the early to mid 1990s; thus, documented declines are largely restricted to species that are still currently abundant and e xperience moderate declines or more uncommon species experiencing dramatic reductions in population size. In this account we focus on 3 classes of declini ng species. First are species that are declining in most of their range, but declin es in Alaska are unsubstantiate d, usually due to lack of data. This group includes species such as Blue Gr ouse, Black Swift, and Rufous Hummingbird (Rich et al. 2004; Sauer et al. 2004). Second are species that are still abundant but are showing evidence of declines in Alaska , but not always across their br oader breeding ranges in North America. Violet-green Swallow, Hermit Thrus h, and White-crowned Sparrow are examples of such species (Sauer et al. 2004). Additionally, species with documented low rates of survival or productivity either statewide or across large regions of the state, such as Wilson's Warblers in upper Cook Inlet (DeSante et al. 2003), are included here. Finally, we have developed i ndividual species accounts for la ndbirds with severe long-term declines throughout their range, including Alaska , because these species are of paramount concern. This group includes Blackpoll Warbler, Olive-sided Flycatcher, and Rusty Blackbird (Rich et al. 2004; Sauer et al. 2003). All further details on th ese birds are included in the individual species accounts on separate templates.

Problems, issues, or concerns for species group All of these species are showi ng signs of population decline eith er in Alaska or significant portions of their breeding range outside of Alaska. Although many of these species are still common, at least regionally, we currently have li ttle insight into whet her these declines are part of natural population cycles or larger ecological problems. Res earch and conservation efforts are needed to identify the causes of declin es and stabilize their pop ulations before they become rare, and their functiona l roles in terrestrial ecosystems in Alaska are lost. These declines warrant further investigation also because they may be indicative of larger ecosystemic problems either in Alaska or in other parts of these species' ranges. Because monitoring programs for landbirds in Alas ka were not widely instituted until the early 1990s, many of these declines have not been documented until very recently. Few biologists and resource managers are awar e of these declines in Alaska, and thus, these species have received little to no recogn ition in the conservation pla nning process in the state. D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Habitats used by these birds vary widely among species. E. Concerns associated with key habitats Variable by species. F. Goal: Conserve declining landbird populations so that they remain sustainable throughout their range within natural population-level variation and historic al distribution across Alaska. G. Conservation objectives and actions State conservation and management needs : Objective : At a minimum, maintain species widely distributed across thei r current range and within the range of natural cycles. However, it may be more appropriate to increase population size to 1966 levels for species d eclining over large parts of th eir range (i.e., PIF Watchlist species listed in Rich et al. 2004). 546 Appendix 4, Page 325 Target: Increasing breeding distributions and population trends. Measure: Population trends estimated jointly from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (NABBS) in Alaska and its complementary program in roadless areas of the state, the Alaska Landbird Monitoring Survey (ALMS). Issue 1: Ability to maintain long-term monitoring of NABBS routes in appropriate places in the state. Conservation action: Maintain participation in the NABBS in Alaska at no less than present level. Issue 2 : Current knowledge of population trends is based solely on the roadside NABBS, which only samples a small proportion of the species br eeding range in Alaska. Therefore, it may be inappropriate to extend the objective for this sp ecies to outside of th e NABBS corridor without an appropriate evaluation of its status in roadless areas. Conservation actions : a) Examine independent data on trends from mi gration stations, other breeding surveys, and demographic monitoring to determine if declines are evident in areas away from the road system. b) Encourage and implement full participati on in ALMS. Random sampling of roadless areas will improve estimates of populat ion size and percent global population in Alaska, reduce bias in trends associat ed with geographically limited NABBS, improve knowledge or distribution, and when combined with data from the NABBS, increase statistical power in detecting statewide trends . Surveys should be conducted for no less than 25 years. Issue 3 : There is a general lack of understanding of the breeding habitat associations of these species in Alaska. Thus, it is difficult to conserve important areas to he lp meet the objective of restoring populations to 1980s levels. Conservation actions: a) Conduct field studies and/or analyses of existing data to determine habitats, habitat attributes, and geographic locations that s upport high densities of this species during breeding and migration in Alaska. Determine if declines in habitat may be linked to declines in population size. Combine such studies with conservation action \"j\" when possible. b) Use results from such studies to direct re search to important areas and strategically protect or enhance important areas and habitats to help meet the objective of restoring populations to 1980s le vels (Rosenberg 2004a and 2004b). c) Communicate the habitat associations of th ese species to appropriate agencies in Alaska. Issue 4 : Causes of population de clines are rarely known. 547 Appendix 4, Page 326 Conservation actions : a) Raise profile of decline of these species to pique interest in th e research community for exploring causes. b) Conduct targeted demographic studies to id entify deficits in survival, reproduction, or recruitment and whether such deficits are linked with specific habitats, habitat changes, geographic locations, exposure to contaminants or diseases, or natural cycles. Priority should be placed on studying suites of species that share habitats during critical times of the year. c) Based on research findings, develop a nd implement conservation actions in appropriate areas to re verse population decline. Issue 5 : Wilson's Warbler has been found to have lo w rates of survival and productivity in upper Cook Inlet, suggesting regional problems with the status of this sp ecies (DeSante et al. 2003). Conservation action: Determine if species has diffe rent population trajectory in Southcentral Alaska compared to other regions in the state; if so, identify cause of the regional decline and develop strate gies to remediate the problem. Issue 6 : For some species, such as Black Swift, even full implementation of the NABBS and ALMS will be insufficient to determine population status and trends due to the species' unique ecology and the sampling parameters of the 2 programs. Conservation actions : a) Conduct field studies as appr opriate to determine habitats and geographic locations of these species in Alaska. b) Develop protocols that adequately sample populations of these species. Global conservation and management needs : Objective : Reverse population declines. Target: At a minimum, maintain still common sp ecies (e.g., Dark-eyed J unco) appropriately distributed across their current range at population sizes within the range of natural cycles. For Partners in Flight Continental Watch Li st, increase population size to 1966 levels (Rich et al. 2004). Measure: NABBS and Christmas Bird Count (CBC). Issue 1 : Cause(s) of decline is/are unknown. Conservation action: Collaborate with researchers and conservationists in appropriate locations in North and South America to iden tify the cause(s) of dec line, and develop and implement strategies for remediating the pr oblem(s), once identifie d (Rich et al. 2004). Issue 2 : Poor recognition of population decline among public, academic, and conservation communities. 548 Appendix 4, Page 327 Conservation action: Develop and distribute information about the decline to the public, academic, and conservation communities. Issue 3 : Much coordination will be needed among stat es, provinces, and agencies to develop and implement strategies to reverse declines across the ranges of these species. Conservation action: Develop numerical goals for conser vation (i.e., amount of habitats for restoration) appropriately for each state a nd province included in the species range and implement strategies for reaching these goals for each area (Rich et al. 2004). H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats Monitoring by NABBS and ALMS should be conduc ted annually from present for a minimum of 25 years. Studies of demography and habitat associations should begin as soon as possible and continue for a minimum of 5 years. NA BBS work is underway in Alaska through cooperative interagency efforts and a networ k of volunteers. At this point the ALMS, demography, and nesting habitat studies are only partially funded; partic ipants should include USGS, USFWS, NPS, BLM, USFS, DOD, State of Alaska, NGOs, universities, and private landowners, including but not restricted to Native corporations and industry.

Problems, issues, or concerns for species group All of these species are sensitive to losses of mature, coniferous forest throughout their ranges in Alaska. Timber and salvage harvest and associated road construction in Alaska not only decrease forest cover, but also alter or eliminate attr ibutes of forest structure, composition, configuration, and connectivity ne eded by populations of these birds. Many of the important habitat attributes in mature stands that are needed by these species are not recruited into harvested stands for more th an 100 years, such as snags and dead wood material on live trees (e.g., broken treetops) fo r cavity-nesting bird s (Sallabanks et al. 2001). Harvest prescriptions are sometimes appl ied during timber removal to minimize the negative effects of logging (such as riparian buffers), but their efficacy has not been evaluated. Forest management that protects im portant resources, such as patches of large diameter trees, riparian corridors, and snags, is likely to be most beneficial to these birds. Postharvest prescriptions su ch as planting, herbicide a pplication, and thinning are sometimes used to increase commercial tr ee growth but have unknown consequences on forest-associated birds. In Southeast Alaska these species are typi cally found more commonly in large-tree old- growth forests of hemlock-spruce at lower elev ations than second-growth stands of varying ages following clearcutting (Kessler and Kogut 1985, Zwickel 1992, DellaSala et al. 1996, Russel 1999, Kissling 2003, Andres et al. in pr ess). Large-scale natural disturbance is largely absent from these coastal forests; thus, widespread disturbance from logging may have landscape effects on these birds. A bi rd of particular concern among this group of birds is the Prince of Wales Spruce Grouse, which appears to be endemic on Prince of Wales and nearby islands in southern Southeast Alaska (Dic kerman and Gustafson 1996). Many of these species whose breeding ranges extend into the boreal forest, such as the Brown Creeper, Golden-crowned Kinglet, Vari ed Thrush, and Townsend's Warbler, are with mature white spruce or mixed white spruce/paper birch forests for breeding (Spindler Kessel 1980, Matsuoka et al. 1997a and 1997b) , and therefore, decrease in density following removal of the large trees through fire s, outbreaks of bark 552 Appendix 4, Page 331 beetles, and associated salvage logging (Q uinlan 1978, Lance and Howell 2000, Collins et al. 2001). Other species, such as Hairy, American Three-toed, and Black-backed woodpeckers, however, increase in abundance du ring beetle outbreaks (Lance and Howell 2000) or immediately following fires (Hu tto 1995, Murphy and Lehnhausen 1998), but salvage logging eliminates resources needed by these birds (Hutto 1995). Because the boreal forest is the home to frequent and larg e-scale natural disturba nces from fires and insect outbreaks, silvicultural systems that mimic natural disturbances may be promising, but require development. Recent research suggests that changes in cl imate may be having large-scale effects on forests in Alaska. Warming trends have favored reproduction of to unprecedented outbreaks in the last decade, and low snowfall may be causing widespread mortality among yellow cedar in Southeast Alaska. Similarly, the frequency of large-scale fires and wind storms may increase with continue d changes in climate. The effects of these forest disturbances and associated salvage logging activities on bird communities are largely unknown and need further study. Biologists and land managers generally lack in formation regarding hab itat associations for these species, and are thus unabl e to provide effective strategi es for conserving or restoring important avian habitats or habitat attributes. Knowledge of the specific components of forest structure (vertical a nd horizontal), composition, and configuration used by these species would allow land managers to make better decisions regarding harvest prescriptions, rotations peri ods, second-growth management, fire management, and habitat restoration and ultimately lead to more effec tive avian conservation. Results from research in this area must be put into the hands of managers as soon as possible so that findings can be incorporated into the planning process. D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Key coastal forest habitats include low elevati on, medium and large sized conifer forests of uneven age structure. Condition of these habitats varies from much degraded to pristine. Many private and state-owned lands in Southeast Alaska, Prince William Sound, and the Kodiak Archipelago are degraded as a resu lt of logging, mining, and associated road construction. In Southeast Alaska forests on Pr ince of Wales, Heceta, northeast Chichagof, Kupreanof, and Kuiu Islands are particularly degraded from extensive clearcut logging. Despite large-scale industrial logging in the region, Alaska supports more than \u00bc of the Earth's coastal temperate rain forest and mainta ins the largest and most pristine tracts left in the world (DellaSala et al. 2001). However, pristine coastal forest s in Southeast Alaska are generally restricted to designated parks and monuments, including Admiralty Island National Monument, Misty Fjords National Monument, Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, and several federall y designated wilderness areas within the Tongass National Forest. Critical interior forest habitat includes mature forests of upland and riparian white spruce and mixed white spruce and variable deciduous sp ecies. Similar to coastal forests, interior forest condition is largely related to land owne rship. Large tracts of state and private land 553 Appendix 4, Page 332 on the Kenai Peninsula are highly degraded due to salvage logging. Small amounts of logging have also occurred in the Tanana Stat e Forest and the Native lands in the Copper River Basin, leaving these areas somewhat degr aded as well. Additionally, Interior forests have been fragmented locally from urban and industrial development (e.g., oil and gas). However, the majority of the boreal forest in Alaska is still largely pristine. E. Concerns associated with key habitats See C and D above. F. Goal: Ensure that populations of bird species sensitive to forest management remain sustainable throughout their range within natu ral population-level vari ation and historical distribution across Alaska . G. Conservation objectives and actions Objective : Maintain species widely distributed acro ss their current range and at a level of abundance that is + 20% of current population size. Target 1: Stable geographic breeding di stribution and population trend. Measure 1: Distribution and trends in abundance relative to habitat estimated from the statewide NABBS and ALMS. Issue 1a : General poor information on distri bution, population size, and trends. Conservation action: Maintain participation in the NABBS in Alaska at no less than present level, and complement information from this program by fully implementing the ALMS program in Alaska. The latter will require broad participation among federal, state, and private land managers in Alaska. Issue 1b: Early breeding species (e .g., Blue Grouse, woodpeck ers), species occurring naturally at low densities (e.g., woodpeckers), species with low detectability (e.g., Brown Creeper), and taxa with restricted ranges (e.g., Spruce Grouse on Prince of Wales and other nearby islands) may not be adequately mon itored by existing survey programs (i.e., NABBS and ALMS). Conservation action: Develop survey and monitori ng protocols for early breeding species and those with low det ectability and/or low densities. Issue 1c: Broad-scale monitoring using the NABBS and ALMS program may not meet the information needs for geographic areas that ar e undergoing rapid and wi despread reductions in forest cover. In particular, more specific in formation is needed on the long-term effects of timber harvest, fire, insect outbreaks, salvage harvest, and associated pre- and postharvest prescriptions on bird populations. Conservation actions : a) Develop inventories and/or simulation mode ls to assess the short-term effects of landscape change on bird communities in areas undergoing rapid and widespread changes in forest cover. 554 Appendix 4, Page 333 b) Monitor successional trajectories of bird communities to evaluate the long-term effects of forest change. Priority sh ould be placed on evaluating pre- and postharvest activities app lied to promote wildlife popul ations (i.e., variable retention, buffers, reforestation, second-g rowth thinning). Whenever possible, use such data to develop empirical and/or simulation models to assess both current and future benefits of such prescriptions. Issue 1d : The distribution a nd population status of the Pr ince of Wales Spruce Grouse warrants additional assessment as this \"subspecies\" is endemic to a small number of islands in southern Southeast Alaska. Conservation actions : a) Conduct surveys to assess popul ation size, densities, and distribution of this subspecies related to forest management and identify important areas and habitats for conservation. b) Conduct phylogenetic studies to assess the degr ee of isolation of this subspecies from other nearby populations of Spruce Grouse. Target 2: Maintain amount of appropriate ha bitat needed to s upport species across current range and at a level of abundance that is + 20% of current population size. Measure 2: Quantify the amount and distribution of appropriate forest habitat. Changes in forest cover should be monitored grossly by compiling information on forest area harvested and restored in Alas ka through existing sources of information. More specific changes in forest structure, cover, and composition should be monitored preferably statewid e, but at a minimum in areas with high rates of change, using remote sensing at 10-year intervals. Issue 2a: Limited information on the appropriate types, amounts, and configurations of forest habitat needed by these species hi nders the development of habitat targets. Such information is needed to better evaluate pla nned harvest activities a nd to develop habitat targets (Target 2) that will help achieve numerical goals for bird populations (Target 1; Rosenberg 2004 a and 2004b). Information on habitats important in supporting high survival or reproductive success is lacking. Conservation actions: a) Compile and review existing information on ha bitat use and natural history patterns for these birds to identify important habitats and develop general habitat targets. b) Develop more specific habitat selection m odels for birds in geographic areas that are undergoing rapid change. When possible, use existing regional GIS data on forest cover (i.e., Southeas t Alaska and Kenai Peninsul a) in combination with existing data from bird surveys (NABBS , ALMS, and other surveys) to develop more specific habitat targets. c) For species that are highly restricted to ma ture forests, specific research should be conducted to identify habitats, habitat at tributes, and geographic areas associated with high reproduction success and survival. Such information would give insight into the mechanisms governing avian re sponses to habitat manipulations and would provide an improved basis fo r developing habitat targets and recommendations for forest management. d) Provide information from these efforts to managers as soon as possible so that findings can be incorporated into the planning process. 555 Appendix 4, Page 334 Issue 2b: Existing information on timber harvest and forest restoration in Alaska is not compiled in order to assess how changes in fo rest cover may be affecting bird populations. Conservation action: Monitor gross changes in forest cover by compiling information on timber and salvage harvest and forest rest oration activities in Alaska from the USFS, Alaska Division of Forestry, and other appropri ate sources on an annua l or biennial basis. Issue 2c: Lack of detailed information on forest cover, structure, and composition for Alaska, particularly on state and private lands, limits our ability to evaluate the cumulative effects of forest management on regiona l or statewide populations of birds. Detailed data are currently only availa ble for specific areas, such as th e Tongass National Forest, Kenai Peninsula, and a growing nu mber of national parks. Conservation action: Develop a statewide landcover map for Alaska that includes data layers for forest structure and species com position at a minimum resolution of 30 meters. Issue 2d: Harvest prescriptions and best management practices need to be better designed and implemented on some federa l, state, and private lands. The development and application of such prescriptions will be useful in minimizing the negative effects of forest management on birds. Conservation action: Encourage federal, state, and pr ivate landowners to consider and implement best management practices for the conservation of declining forest birds. H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats NABBS work is ongoing in Alaska through cooperative intera gency efforts and a network of volunteers. Presently, the ALMS program ha s not been fully implemented statewide and is only partially funded. Development of a statewide landcover map is unfunded, and responsibility for this task does not belong to a particular agency or private organization. Studies of demography, habita t selection, and effectivene ss monitoring are also unfunded at this time. Participants should include USGS, USFWS, NPS, DOD, USFS, BLM, State of Alaska, nongovernmental organizations, universities, and private landowners. I. Recommended time frame for reviewing species status and trends Ten years unless monitoring suggests that popula tion(s) have fallen below target levels. J. Bibliography Andres, B.A., M.J.

Distribution and abundance Range : Global range comments: Breeding range extends from Al aska east through coniferous forests to southern Labrador, in the Northeas t south to Massachusetts and locally to North Carolina, in the Midwest south to northern Wisconsin and northeaste rn Ohio, and in the West south along coastal ranges to Baja Califo rnia and in the Rock ies to southeastern Arizona and western Texas (Altman 1997). Pr incipal wintering range is Panama and Andes Mountains of northern and western So uth America, from northern and western Venezuela south through Ecuador to southeas tern Peru and western Bolivia (Altman and Sallabanks 2000). State range comments : Regularly breeds in central, sout h-central, southeast, and sparingly western Alaska. Generally at low densities throughout the co niferous boreal and coastal forests of Alaska (often characterized as uncommon or rare [Armstrong 1995]). Ranges to northern and western extent of c oniferous forest to Noatak Ri ver in the northwest, Bethel and Katmai areas in the west/southwest, a nd to Colleen and Porcupine Rivers in the northeast (Kessel and Gibson 1978). 558 Appendix 4, Page 337 Abundance : Population estimates are suspected to be inaccurate (Rich et al. 2004; Rosenberg 2004a and 2004b), but are the onl y available estimates at this time. Global abundance comments: 1,200,000 (Rich et al. 2004) State abundance comments: 270,000 (Rosenberg 2004a and 2004b) Trends : Global trends: From 1966 to 2003 a population decline of 3.5% per year ( P < 0.01, n = 776 routes) detected on the NABBS (Sauer et al. 2004). State trends: From 1980 to 2002 a population decline of 3.3% per year ( P = 0.09, n = 49 routes) detected on the NABBS in Alaska (S auer et al. 2003). Th e period of documented population decline is shorter in Alaska due to the lack of monito ring surveys prior to 1980. C. Problems, issues, or concerns for species Steep, rangewide decline in numbers of breeding birds. Current estimates suggest that the global population has been reduced by over 70% since 1966. Trend similar in Alaska as in rest of the species range. Reasons for decline unknown, but rapid losses of forested habitats on wintering grounds in the Andes foothills and mountains are a susp ected but untested cause of the decline. Because the genus Contopus has the lowest reproductive rate of all North American passerines, lowered survival resulting from losses of favored wintering habitat could be particularly problematic for this spec ies (Altman and Sallabanks 2000). Rates of survivorship not currently known. Because this species is closely tied to recently burned forests and, to a lesser extent, bark beetle infested forests for breeding, fire suppression and salvage harvest may be detrimental to populations (Hutto 1995; St one 1995). Harvested stands may act as \"ecological traps\" that attract breeding birds because of the forest opening they create but support low rates of nest success compared to favored postfire st ands because of high densities of predators supported by adjacent live stands (Altman and Sallabanks 2000). Climate change may also affect this species by changing the energetic requirements of long- distance migration, availability of flying insects for food, frequency of fires and bark beetle epidemics, or drying of favored muskegs and fo rested bogs and swamps in the boreal forest (Altman and Sallabanks 2000). 559 Appendix 4, Page 338 D. Location and condition of ke y or important habitat areas Breeding: Considered an indicator species of the coni ferous forest biome throughout North America, although it is occasionally found in mixed deciduous /coniferous forests. In central Alaska, most often found in stands of open canopy spruce ( Picea glauca and P. mariana). Usually associated with openings (muskegs, mead ows, burns, and logged areas) and water (streams, beaver ponds, bogs, and lakes). Apparently requires an uneven canopy or openings for aerial hawking a nd wet areas productive of ins ect prey. Regularly uses prominent dead or partially dead trees fo r perching, singing, and hawking. In central Alaska, perches averaged 1.4 times the hei ght of surrounding tree ca nopy; 25% of perches were dead trees, 51% were partially dead (mos t with dead tops), and 24% were live. Nests were placed in live trees, primarily black spruce, that were slightly shorter than surrounding canopy (Wright 1997). Breeding habita ts in Alaska are generally in good condition. Winter: Primary wintering habitat (based on limited an ecdotal information) is mature evergreen forests, particularly montane forest. Reaches highest densities in Andes in Columbia, where it occurs in lightly forested areas a nd forested edges from 400 to 2600 m. This is one of the most heavily altere d habitats in South America. Andean valleys are almost completely deforested, and 85% or more of montane forests have been cut (Altman and Sallabanks 2000). E. Concerns associated with key habitats On breeding grounds in Alaska, forest manageme nt, particularly salvage harvest, may be detrimental to this species. Climate change and associated landscape drying could decrease the suitability of muskegs, bogs, and streamsi de habitat for breeding, as well as alter the availability of flying insects for foraging. On wintering grounds, forests favored by this species have been one of the most heavily altered habitats in South America. Andean va lleys are almost completely deforested, and 85% or more of montane forests have been cut. From an examination of 123 migrant landbirds, the Olive-sided Flycat cher was considered one of the 12 species most vulnerable to extinction from tropical deforestation pr imarily because of restriction to undisturbed broadleaf forest during winter (Pet it et al. 1993, 1995). F. Goal: Ensure Olive-sided Flycatcher populations remain sustainable throughout their range within natural population-leve l variation and historical distribution across Alaska . G. Conservation objectives and actions State conservation and management needs : Objective : Restore population to 1980 levels in Alaska. Target: An average 3.3% increase in population size per year over the next 25 years. Measure: Population trend estimated jointly from the NABBS in Alaska and its complementary program in roadle ss areas of the state, ALMS. 560 Appendix 4, Page 339 Issue 1: Ability to maintain long-term monitoring of NABBS routes in appropriate places in the state. Conservation action: Maintain participation in the NABBS in Alaska at no less than present level; identify individuals to adopt routes that have been discontinued; observers must commit to no fewer than 3 consecutive years of service. Issue 2 : Current knowledge of population trends is based solely on the roadside NABBS, which only samples a small proportion of the spec ies breeding range in Alaska. Therefore, it may be inappropriate to extend the objective for this species to outside of the NABBS corridor without an appropriate evalua tion of its status in roadless areas. Conservation actions : a) Examine independent data on trends from migration stations or other breeding surveys to determine if declines are evid ent in areas away from the road system. b) Encourage and implement full participat ion in ALMS, whose random sampling of roadless areas will improve estimates of population size and percent global population in Alaska, reduce bias in trends associated with geographically limited NABBS, improve knowledge of distribution and habitat use and, when combined with data from the NABBS, increase statistical power in detecting statewide trends. Surveys should be run for no less than 25 years. Issue 3 : There is a general lack of understanding of the breeding habitat requirements of this species in Alaska. Thus, it is difficult to deve lop and implement strategies to conserve or enhance important areas for breeding to help m eet the objective of re storing populations to 1980s levels. Conservation actions: a) Conduct field studies or analys es of existing data to de termine important habitats, habitat attributes, and geogr aphic locations for this species in Alaska. Combine such studies with the second conservation action listed in Issue 4, when possible. b) Effects of disturbance from fires, insect outbreaks, and particularly associated salvage logging activitie s should be evaluated. c) Use results from such studies to strategi cally protect or enhance important areas and habitats to help meet the objective of restoring populations to 1980s levels (Rosenberg 2004a and 2004b). d) Communicate the habitat needs of this sp ecies to appropriate land managers and regulatory agencies in Alaska. Issue 4 : Current cause of population decline unk nown but could be ope rating outside of Alaska on nonbreeding sites. Howe ver, the decline must be linke d to deficits in survival, reproduction, or recruitment. 561 Appendix 4, Page 340 Conservation actions : a) Raise profile of demise of species to pique interest in the research community for exploring causes of decline. b) Conduct targeted demographic studies to identify deficits in reproduction and, particularly, survival and recruitment a nd whether such deficits are linked with specific habitats, habitat changes, geographic locations, or exposure to contaminants or diseases. Information on survival and recruitment are needed in particular. c) Conduct studies using stable isotopes a nd/or genetics to determine important nonbreeding sites (migration stopover, wintering) for Alaskan breeding populations and whether losses of habitats in these areas may be contributing to the decline. d) Based on research findings, develop a nd implement conservation actions in appropriate areas to re verse population decline. Global conservation and management needs : Objective : Restore population to 1966 levels across the breeding range (Rich et al. 2004). Target: Population level in 1966 (Rich et al. 200 4). This equates to an average 3.5% annual increase in population size over the next 38 years. Measure: NABBS. Issue 1 : Current knowledge of population decline is based solely on the roadside NABBS, which only samples a small proportion of the species breeding range. Therefore, it may be inappropriate to extend the objective for this species to outside of the NABBS corridor without an evaluation of its status in roadless areas. Conservation action: Analyze data from appropriate migration stations and other breeding and nonbreeding surveys to determine if declines are evident from independent data sets and in roadless areas; the latter may be im portant in supporting \"source\" populations. Issue 2 : Cause(s) of decline is/are unknown. Conservation actions : a) Collaborate with North and South American researchers and conservationists to determine causes of decline and develop and implement strategies to remediate the problem(s) once identified. b) Effects of forest management on breedi ng birds should be further evaluated. In particular, prescribed fire and silvicultu ral systems that mimic the natural effects of fire and beetle outbreaks should be test ed as a means of enhancing habitats for this species. Issue 3 : Poor understanding of linkages between breeding, staging, and wintering sites. 562 Appendix 4, Page 341 Conservation action: Conduct genetic and stable isotop e studies to determine linkages between breeding, staging, and wintering populat ions to identify important areas and habitats for distinct populations of this species. Issue 4 : Poor recognition of population decline among public, academia, and conservation communities. Conservation action: Develop and distribute information about the decline to the public, academia, and conservation communities. H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats Monitoring by NABBS and ALMS should be conducted annually from present for a minimum of 25 years. Studies of demogra phy and habitat requirements should begin as soon as possible and continue for a minimum of 5 years. NABBS work is underway in Alaska through co operative interagency efforts and a network of volunteers. At this point the ALMS, dem ography, and nesting habitat studies are only partially funded; should include USGS, USFW DOD, State of Alaska, NGOs, universit ies, and private landowners, in cluding, but not restricted to Native corporations and industry.

Distribution and abundance Range : Global range comments: Breeds from northern and we stern Alaska, throughout Yukon and southern Northwest Territories, east and so uth to central plains provinces to northern Ontario, central Quebec, throughout Labrador and Newfoundland; south to New York, Maine and Massachusetts. Winters in Ecuador, Columbia, Venezuela, Peru, Chile and Peru (Terres 1980). State range comments: In Alaska, breeds in western Alas ka as far north as Selawik and the Kobuk and lower Noatak drainages, south to Katmai, common east to central Alaska and south to the Matanuska- Susitna Valleys, less common in east-central Alaska, the Kenai Peninsula. Rare migrant in South east Alaska (Kessel a nd Gibson 1978; Boreal Partners in Flight 1999; Cotter and Andr es 2000). Highest breeding densities were recorded in riparian areas along the tributaries of the lower Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers in western Alaska (Harwood 2002). Abundance : Population estimates from Rosenberg ( 2004) are suspected to be inaccurate, but are the only available estimates at this time. Global abundance comments: 21,000,000 birds. State abundance comments: 6,400,000 birds. Trends : Global trends: Survey data from NABBS, 1980 to 2003 (not including Alaska), showed a population decline of 9.2% per year ( P < 0.01, n = 54 survey routes; Sauer et al. 2004). Increasing from 1966 to 1980 (Sauer et al. 2004). State trends: Data from NABBS from 1980 to 2003 in Alaska showed a population decline of 3.8% per year ( P = 0.01, n = 50 survey routes; Sauer et al. 2004). C. Problems, issues, or concerns for species Precipitous population decline : Data from the NABBS indicate this species has suffered the steepest long-term decline of any Neotropical-Nearctic migrant landbird since 1980, with populations diminished by over 50% and 90% across breeding rang es in Alaska and Canada, respectively (Sauer et al. 2004). Large proportion (30%) of the global population estimated to breed in Alaska (Rosenbe rg 2004a and 2004b). NABBS trend information may be biased. Climate change : The causes for this decline are poorly understood; however, climate changes may be in part responsible for this trend. Recent resear ch showed that the abundance of breeding Blackpoll Warblers fr om 1967 to 1996 was negatively correlated with the frequency and severity of tropical storms over the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico during autumn passage the previous ye ar (Butler 2000). As th is species undertakes the longest migration of any North American warbler, including a continuous transoceanic autumn flight from northeastern United States and southeastern Cana da to northern South America (Nisbet et al. 1995), the Blackpoll Wa rbler may be particularly susceptible to mortality during migration, which has been found to account for 90% of annual mortality for its congener, the 565 Appendix 4, Page 344 Holmes 2002). Climate change may be further th reatening the population of this species in Alaska by modifying favored riparian and bog habitats through permafrost degradation and drying. Habitat loss : Habitat loss at breeding and nonbree ding areas is another concern. Some examples include: Logging of Canadian boreal forest. Breedi ng densities declined in 20 m riparian strips after surrounding habitat was remove d by clearcutting (Darveau et al. 1995). Degradation of red spruce and subalpin e spruce-fir forests resulting from acid precipitation in northeastern United States and southeastern Canada may adversely affect reproduction by eliminating favored red spruce for nesting (Smith et al. 1986; Moegenburg and Greenberg 2004). Deforestation of lowland Amazonia may negatively influence Blackpoll Warblers; however, little is known about habitat use during nonbreeding season. One of the migrant landbirds considered most likely to be negativel y affected by destruction of tropical forests. Degradation of important migration stopover sites, particularly in southeastern Canada, northeastern United States and northern South America. Poor information on breeding and wintering ecology : In general, the breeding and wintering ecology of this species is poorly studied. In Alaska we have a poor quantitative understanding of what habitats and habitat at tributes are important in supporting viable breeding populations of this species. Als o, information on survival and reproductive output/success would be useful for developing population models to identify demographic bottlenecks for this species. Other concerns : This species commonly collides w ith towers during migration (i.e communication towers, wind turbines, buildings), presumably due to attraction to lights (Hunt and Eliason 1999). Wind energy deve lopment and the cell phone industry are resulting in growing numbers of towers in both the United States and Canada. Widespread use of pesticides and dioxins on wintering grounds and accumulations of such materials in Alaska may adversely influence Blackpoll Warblers. D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Use of habitats for breeding changes from pre dominantly coniferous forests in the eastern and central portion of range to primarily deciduous habitats in Alaska. In Alaska, typically breeds in moist habitats along rivers, streams, or bogs, particularly in deciduous forest and tall shrub thickets (particularly Salix alaxensis and Alnus incana ), the spruce ( Picea glauca or P. Andres 2000). Also found in similar habitats at the transition zone between tree-line taiga and either alpine or coastal tundra (Kesse l 1998), with the Yukon Delta being a possible exception (McCaffery 1996). Species reaches its highest breeding dens ity in Alaska in riparian habitats in western Alaska (McCaffery 1996; Harwood 2002). Most of these habitats are not threatened by development. 566 Appendix 4, Page 345 E. Concerns associated with key habitats Reductions in the suitability of breeding habi tats used by this species across Canada and the northeastern United States as a result of widespread resource development (forestry, oil and gas) and acid rain. Such changes may increase the value of undisturbed habitats in Alaska. Breeding habitats in Alaska generally in good c ondition. However, since this species is associated with riparian areas and muskegs in Alaska, patterns in landscape drying resulting from climate change may reduce the suitability of habitats favored by this species for breeding. Threats on nonbreeding areas may be of partic ular concern for this species. A recent examination of 123 migrant landbirds suggested that Blackpoll Warbler is one of the 12 species most vulnerable to extinction from tropical deforestation primarily because of restriction to undisturbed broa dleaf forest during winter (Petit et al . 1993, 1995). Also the quality and quantity of stopover habitats during migration may be paramount for populations of this species as it undergoes th e longest migration of any North American warbler, including a continuous transoceanic migr ation in autumn from the Atlantic coast of southeastern Canada/northeastern Unite d States to northern South America. (See also the \"Habitat Loss\" description in section C.) F. Goal: Ensure Blackpoll Warbler populations remain sustainable throughout their range within natural population-leve l variation and historical distribution across Alaska. G. Conservation objectives and actions State conservation and management needs : Objective : Restore population to 1980 levels in Alaska. Target: An average 3.8% increase in population size per year over the next 25 years. Measure: Population trend estimated jointly from the NABBS in Alaska and its complementary program in roadle ss areas of the state, ALMS. Issue 1: Ability to maintain long-term monitoring of NABBS routes in appropriate places in the state. Conservation actions: a) Maintain participation in the NABBS in Alaska at no less than present level. In particular, encourage runni ng river routes annually. b) Identify individuals to adopt routes th at have been discontinued (particularly river routes); observers must commit to no fewer than 3 consecutive years of service. c) Resume NABBS routes conducted in lower Yukon and Kuskokwim river watersheds (done 1998-2002) biennially for 25 years. Issue 2 : Current knowledge of population trends is based solely on the roadside NABBS, which only samples a small proportion of the spec ies breeding range in Alaska. Therefore, it may be inappropriate to extend the objective for this species to outside of the NABBS corridor without an appropriate evalua tion of its status in roadless areas. 567 Appendix 4, Page 346 Conservation actions : a) Examine independent data on trends from migration stations, the Alaska Off- road Breeding Bird Survey, or other survey s to determine if declines are evident in areas away from the road system. b) Encourage and implement full participat ion in ALMS), whose random sampling of roadless areas will improve estimate s of population size and percent global population in Alaska, reduce bias in tr ends associated with geographically limited NABBS, improve knowledge of distribution and, when combined with data from the NABBS, increase statistical power in detecti ng statewide trends. Surveys should be run for no less than 25 years. Issue 3 : There is a general lack of understanding of the breeding habitat requirements of this species in Alaska. Thus, it is difficult to cons erve or enhance important areas for breeding to help meet the objective or restoring populations to 1980s levels. Conservation actions: a) Conduct field studies or analys es of existing data to de termine important habitats and habitat attributes that support high densities, abundant food resources, or high rates of survival, reproduction, and re cruitment. Combine such studies along with the second conservation acti on under Issue 4, when possible. b) Use results from such studies to strategi cally protect or enhance important areas and habitats to help meet the objective of restoring populations to 1980s levels (Rosenberg 2004a and 2004b). c) Communicate the habitat needs of this sp ecies to appropriate land managers and regulatory agencies in Alaska. Issue 4 : Current cause of population decline unk nown but could be ope rating outside of Alaska on nonbreeding sites. Howe ver, the decline must be linke d to deficits in survival, reproduction, or recruitment. Conservation actions : a) Raise profile of demise of species to pique interest in the research community for exploring causes of decline. b) Conduct targeted demographic studies to identify deficits in survival, reproduction, or recruitment and whether such deficits are linked with specific habitats, habitat changes, geographic locations, or expos ure to contaminants or diseases. Standardized protocols by the Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship (MAPS) program and Breeding Bird Database may be appropriately applied to this species to help answer some of these questions. c) Conduct studies using stable isotopes a nd/or genetics to determine important nonbreeding sites (migration stopover, wintering) for Alaskan breeding populations and whether losses of habitats in these areas may be contributing to the decline. d) Based on research findings, develop a nd implement conservation actions in appropriate areas to re verse population decline. 568 Appendix 4, Page 347 Issue 5 : Potential exposure to contaminants is a concern across their range. Conservation action: Conduct assessment of presence of contaminants in breeding and wintering Blackpoll Warblers. Global conservation and management needs : Objective : Restore population to 1980 le vels across the breeding range. Target: 1980 population level. Measure: NABBS. Issue 1 : Current knowledge of population decline is based solely on the roadside NABBS, which only samples a small proportion of the species breeding range. Therefore, it may be inappropriate to extend the objective for this species to outside of the NABBS corridor without an evaluation of its status in roadless areas. Conservation action: Analyze data from appropriate migration stations and other breeding and nonbreeding surveys to determine if declines are evident from independent data sets. Issue 2 : Cause(s) of decline is/are unknown Conservation actions : a) Collaborate with North American, South American, and Caribbean researchers and conservationists to determine causes of decline. b) Examine further the potential role of st orm frequency during fall migration over the Atlantic Ocean in causing dec lines in this species (Bulter 2000). c) Future studies on reproduction should focus on replicating previous work (Eliason 1986a and 1986b), complementing ongoing work on the effects of acid rain on the species (Moegenburg and Gree nberg 2004), testing the effects of land management actions, or obtaining data fr om areas still supporting high densities of this species (e.g., Western Alaska). d) Determine if an assessment of wintering ground habitats and demographics could be incorporated into ongoing research on other migrant birds in South America (e.g., Cerulean Warbler). Issue 3 : Poor understanding of linkages between breeding, staging, and wintering sites. Conservation action: Conduct genetic and stable isotop e studies to determine linkages between breeding, staging, and wintering populat ions to identify important areas and habitats for distinct populations of this species. Issue 4 : Poor recognition of population decline among public, academia, and conservation communities. 569 Appendix 4, Page 348 Conservation action: Develop and distribute informa tion about the decline to the public, academic, and conservation communities. Issue 5 : Much coordination will be needed among states, provinces, and agencies to develop and implement strategies to reverse dec lines across the ranges of this species. Conservation actions : a) Develop numerical goals for conserva tion (i.e., amount of habitats for restoration) appropriately for each stat e and province included in the species range and implement strategies for reaching these goals for each area (Rich et al. 2004). b) Increase the amount of land in national or provincial parks and wildlife preserves in Canada and across wintering areas in South America. c) Encourage the adoption of broad-scale land management policies that protect important breeding habitats or enhance habitats previously degraded from harvest or other management activities. d) Protect and enhance habitats along key migration stopover sites, particularly along the Eastern seaboard, where autumn migrants depart land to undertake a continuous transoceanic crossing to South America. H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats Monitoring by NABBS, Yukon-Kuskokwim Rive r BBS, and ALMS should be conducted annually from present for a minimum of 25 years. Studies of demography and habitat requirements should begin as soon as possible and continue for a minimum of 5 years.

Distribution and abundance 572 Appendix 4, Page 351 Range : Global range comments: Breeding range: extends from the west coast of Al aska to the east coast of Canada (Avery 1995). The northern extent is delineated by Kotzebue Sound and the Brooks Range in Alaska, Mackenzie Delta , Great Bear Lake, Great Slave Lake, and Nueltin Lake in Northwest Territ ories, the coast of Hudson Bay from Churchill, Manitoba to northern Quebec, a nd across Quebec to the coast of central Labrador. The southern edge of the breed ing range extends from southern Alaska, through central Canada from the interior of British Columbia to the northern shores of Lake Superior and Lake Hu ron, through southeastern Ontario to Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. Also breeds on the upper peninsula of Michigan, in the Adirondack Mountai ns of New York, and in western Massachusetts. Winter range: primarily in the eastern half of the United States from eastern Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas to the Atlantic coas t between southern Massachusetts and central Florida, and from southern Wisconsin and Michigan to the Gulf of Mexico (Avery 1995). Al so winters very locally across the northernmost part of the United States a nd the southern edge of Canada from Maine to the coast of British Columbia and into Southeast Alaska. A few winter in eastern Colorado; otherwise, very ra re visitor to western and southwestern United States and south Florida. State range comments: Found throughout most of ma inland Alaska south of the Brooks Range (Kessel and Gibson 1978). Fair ly common spring migrant and breeder, locally common fall migrant, and very rare winter visitor in central Alaska. Fairly common to rare migrant and breeder in we stern and southwestern Alaska (Brann and Andres 1997). Rare spring migrant and possi ble breeder in the Brooks Range. Very rare to casual spring migrant and summer and fa ll visitor to the coasts of the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas, the Bering Sea islands, and the coast of Bristol Bay. Uncommon spring migrant and fairly common fall migrant, rare breeder, and rare winter visitor in southcoastal Alaska. Uncommon migrant and rare to uncommon local breeder (mainland), and rare winter vi sitor in Southeast Alaska. Abundance : Estimates of abundance from Rich et al. (2004) and Rosenberg (2004a and 2004b) likely inaccurate but are the only available estimates of abundance available for the species. Global abundance comments: 2,000,000 individuals (Rich et al. 2004). State abundance comments: 570,000 individuals (Ros enberg 2004a and 2004b). Trends : Global trends: Population decline of 9.2% per year ( P = 0.02, n = 96 routes) documented from the NABBS, 1966-2002 (Sauer et al. 2004). State trends: Population decline of 5.8% per year ( P = 0.03, n = 25 routes) documented from the NABBS, 1980-2002 (S auer et al. 2004). The period of documented population decline is shorter in Alaska due to the lack of monitoring surveys prior to 1980. 573 Appendix 4, Page 352 C. Problems, issues, or concerns for species All evidence suggests that this once abundant bird has been experiencing a chronic decline since the mid 1800s. The decline appears to be accel erating and totaled 90% by 3 independent population surveys (Greenbe rg and Droege 1999). Causes of the population decline currently unknown; however , on wintering grounds destruction of wooded wetlands and blackbird control pr ograms have been suggested, while on breeding grounds acid precipitation and conversi on of boreal forest wetlands have been implied (Greenberg and Droege 1999). Dr ying of wetlands resulting from global climate change may be a growing issue for this and other boreal wetland species in Alaska. Increased attention needs to be given to this species now, while populations are large enough to make conservation actions effectiv e (Greenberg and Droege 1999). Currently no research is being conducted to determ ine the cause of the population decline, although the decline is now well documented (Greenberg 2003). Alaska may be an important stronghold for this species a nd a prime area for research on breeding population since the species is still found in reasonabl e numbers (30% of global population, Rosenberg 2004a and 2004b) unlike other parts of its breeding range in Alberta and the Northwest Territories a nd (Greenberg 2003; S. Droege personal communication). D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Breeds in wet coniferous and mixed forest from the edge of tundra south to the beginning of deciduous forest and grasslands . Frequently found in fens, alder-willow thickets and bogs, muskeg, beaver ponds, tall riparian shrub, swampy shores of lakes and streams, and other forest openings, such as those created by logging, fire, windthrow, and beaver activity. Likes large numbers of conifer saplings and dense foliage 2-4 m above ground. Breeding habitats in south-southeastern part of range in Canada are being lost due to conversion to agricultural lands, logging, and oil and gas development. During spring and fall migration will forage in stubble, pasture, plowed fields, and edges of swamps. Usually roost in wooded areas, but will occasionally roost on the ground in open fields. Wintering habitats include swamps, wet woodlands, pond edges, stream borders, cypress lagoons, marsh edges, and fields adjacent to wet areas (Avery 1995). More closely tied to wooded wetlands during the winter than any other passerine (Greenberg and Droege 1999). Mo re then 80% of this habita t has been lost, principally to use for agriculture, since colonization of the United States. However, recent rates of conversion of wooded wetlands on winter ing grounds do not explain the recent acceleration in population decline (Greenberg and Droege 1999). In Alaska, use of habitats not well describe d except in east-central Alaska, where the Rusty Blackbird is found in open habitats with water wh ere it shows a preference for areas with tall shrubs. Commonly observe d perched in white spruce (36% of observation), willow (30%), 10-12% each in al der, poplar, and dead snags (Spindler and Kessel 1980). In western Alaska found in higher breeding densities along rivers of 574 Appendix 4, Page 353 the Seward Peninsula and tributaries of the lower Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers (Kessel 1989; Harwood 2002). Habitats in Alas ka are generally larg ely intact and not directly disturbed by development (Greenberg 2003). In Southeast Alaska, found to co- occur with Red-winged Blackbirds in fres hwater marshes and in sedges surrounding beaver ponds (Johnson 2003). E. Concerns associated with key habitats Breeding habitats in south-southeastern part of range in Canada are being lost due to conversion to agricultural la nds, logging, and oil and gas development. Habitats in Alaska are generally largely intact an d not directly disturbed by development (Greenberg 2003). However, climate change an d associated degradation of permafrost and drying of ponds and lakes in Alaska could be resulting in lo sses of key habitats used by this species. More then 80% of forested wetlands used by this species on wintering ground have been lost, principally to agriculture, since colonization of the United States. However, more modern rates of conversion of these habitats alone do not explain the recent acceleration in population decline (Greenberg and Droege 1999). F. Goal: Ensure Rusty Blackbird populations rema in sustainable throughout their range within natural population-leve l variation and historical distribution across Alaska. G. Conservation objectives and actions State conservation and management needs : Objective : Restore population to 1980 levels in Alaska. Target: An average 5.8% increase in population size per year over the next 25 years. Measure: NABBS in Alaska and its compleme ntary program in roadless areas of the state, ALMS. Issue 1: Ability to maintain long-term monitoring of NABBS routes in appropriate places in the state. Conservation actions: a) Maintain participation in the NABBS in Alaska at no less than present level. In particular, encourage r unning river routes annually. b) Resume NABBS routes conducted in lower Yukon and Kuskokwim river watersheds (done 1998-2002) biennially for 25 years. Issue 2 : Current knowledge of population trends is based solely on the roadside NABBS, which only samples a small proportion of the species breeding range in Alaska. Therefore. it may be inappropriate to extend the objective for this species to outside of the NABBS corridor without an appropriate evaluation of it s status in roadless areas. Conservation actions : a) Examine independent data on trends from migration stations and other breeding surveys to determine if declines are evident in areas away from the road system. b) Encourage and implement full par ticipation in ALMS, whose random 575 Appendix 4, Page 354 sampling of roadless areas will impr ove estimates of population size and percent global population in Alaska, reduce bias in trends associated with geographically limited NABBS, improve knowledge of distribution and, when combined with data from the NABBS, increase statistical power in detecting statewide trends. Surveys should be run for no less than 25 years. Issue 3 : There is a general lack of understandi ng of the breeding hab itat requirements of this species in Alaska. Thus, it is difficult to conserve or enhance important areas to help meet the objective of restori ng populations to 1980s levels. Conservation actions: a) Conduct field studies or analyses of exis ting data to determine habitats, habitat attributes, and geographic locations that support high densities of this species during breeding and migrati on in Alaska. Aerial surveys of breeding birds could be explored as a means for assessing habitat needs over broad geographic areas. Combine such studie s with the second conservation action under Issue 4, when possible. b) Use results from such studies to dir ect research to important areas and strategically protect or e nhance important areas and habitats to help meet the objective of restoring populations to 1980s levels (Rosenberg 2004a and 2004b). c) Communicate the habitat needs of this species to appropriate land managers and regulatory agencies in Alaska. Issue 4 : Current cause of population decline unk nown but could be ope rating outside of Alaska on nonbreeding sites. Howe ver, the decline must be linke d to deficits in survival, reproduction, or recruitment. Conservation actions : a) Raise profile of demise of species to pi que interest in the research community for exploring causes of decline. b) Conduct targeted demographic studies to identify deficits in survival, reproduction, or recruitment and whether such deficits are linked with specific habitats, habitat changes, geographic locations, or expos ure to contaminants or diseases. c) Based on research findings, develop and implement conservation strategies in appropriate areas to re verse population decline. Global conservation and management needs : Objective : Restore population to 1966 le vels across the breeding range. Target: Population level in 1966, which equates to an average increase of 9.9% in population size over the next 38 years. Measure: NABBS and CBC. 576 Appendix 4, Page 355 Issue 1 : Cause(s) of decline is/are unknown Conservation actions : a) Analyze data from NABBS and CBC fo r spatial variation in abundance and trend to identify both important areas fo r protection and geographic centers of decline on both breeding and wintering areas. b) Collaborate with North American re searchers and conservationists to determine causes of decline and develop and implement strategies for remediating the problem(s) once identified (Rich et al. 2004). c) The affects of acidification of wetlands , blackbird control programs, and loss of forested wetlands on wintering areas on populations should be evaluated (Greenberg and Droege 1999; Greenberg 2003). Issue 2 : Poor recognition of population decline among public, academic, and conservation communities. Conservation action: Develop and distribute informa tion about the decline to the public, academic, and conservation communities. Issue 3 : Much coordination will be needed among states, provinces, and agencies to develop and implement strategies to reverse declines across the ranges of this species. Conservation actions : a) Develop numerical goals for conserva tion (i.e., amount of habitats for restoration) appropriately for each stat e and province included in the species range and implement strategies for reachi ng these goals for each area (Rich et al. 2004). b) Increase the amount of land in national or provincial parks and preserves in Canada. c) Encourage the adoption of broad-scal e land management policies in the United States and Canada that prot ect important breeding and wintering habitats and enhance hab itats previously degraded from land management activities. d) Work through the joint ventures to protec t and enhance wetlands used by this species. H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats Monitoring by NABBS, Yukon-Kuskokwim River BBS, and ALMS should be conducted annually from present for a minimum of 25 years. Studies of demography and habitat requirements should begin as s oon as possible and continue for a minimum of 5 years. NABBS work is underway in Alaska through cooperative interagency efforts and a network of volunteers. At this point the ALMS, demography, and nesting habitat studies are only part ially funded; participants should include USGS, USFWS, NPS, BLM, DOD, State of Alaska, NGOs, private landowners, and universities.

Species group description All of these subspecies and species have ex tremely restricted ranges to a small number of islands within the Aleutian Islands, adj acent islands off the Alaska Peninsula, or Bering Sea Islands. We do not include subspecies that are widely distributed within this region such as Snow Bunting ( Plectrophenax nivalis townsendi sanaka ; central Aleutians, Alaska Peninsula and adjacent islands) since their populations are not as threatened as the taxa included herein. Common names/Scientific names: meligerus, and abundance Range : Distributions described from (Gibs on and Kessel 1997, and Gibson and Byrd State range Rock Ptarmigan Lagopus Resident to Attu Island (reintroduced to Agattu in 2003). L. m. townsendi : Resident to Rat Islands (Kiska to Amchitka) L. m. atkhensis : Resident to Andreanof Atka, possibly Amlia). Winter Wren Troglodytes troglodytes meligerus : Resident to Near Is lands (Attu and Agattu) T. t. kiskensis : Resident from Rat Islands (Kiska) east to islands off Alaska Peninsula (Amak and Amagat). T. t. alascensis : Resident to Pribilof Islands T. t. semidiensis: Resident to Semidi Islands Song Sparrow Melospiza melodia maxima : Resident from the Andreanof Islands to the Near Islands (Attu to Atka, possibly in tumbrina : Breeds on Pribilofs and St. Matthew and Hall Islands. Resident on the Pribilof Islands. McKay's Bunting Breeds principally on St. Matthew a nd Hall Islands, potentially on St. 579 Appendix 4, Page 358 Lawrence and Pribilof Islands. Winters on the mainland along the Bering Sea coast, where it is considered a rare to uncommon migrant a nd visitant (Kessel and Gibson 1978) principally south of Norton Sound and north of Bristol Bay, including Nunivak Island. Casual winter visitant in the Aleutian Islands (Kessel and Gibson 1978). Abundance : Global abundance comments: Estimates from Rich et al . (2004) are likely inaccurate but are the only current estimates for these species. Rock Ptarmigan: 8,200,000 individuals Winter Wren: 36,000,000 individuals McKay's Bunting: 34,000 breeding individu als (S. M. Matsuoka unpublished data from 2003 survey). State abundance comments: Numerical estimates of population size are not available for any of the subspecies below. Rock Ptarmigan: Aleutian subspecies are considered uncommon or fairly common residents and breeders throughout the Aleutians with density ranging from 0.14-0.30 prs./ha; however, does not occur on all islands (Gibson and Byrd, in prep.). Winter Wren: Aleutian subspecies ( T. t. meligerus and T. t. kiskensis ) considered uncommon residents and breeders throughout the Al eutians; however density varies considerably among islands (high at Bu ldir and Amchitka; low at and Byrd, in prep). T. t. alascensis considered an uncommon to rare breeder on the Pribilof Islands (D.R. Ruthrauff, USGS, personal communication). No estimates the Semidi island subspecies (T. t. semidiensis). Song Sparrow: M. m. maxima considered uncommon to common residents and breeder (Gibson and Byrd, in prep.). Gray-crowned Rosy Finch: Unknown but likely less than 10,000 indi viduals (D.R. Ruthrauff, personal communication). McKay's Bunting: 34,000 breeding individuals (S.M. Matsuoka unpublished data). Trends : Global trends: Rock Ptarmigan, Gray-crowned Rosy Finch and McKay's Bunting: no estimates of trends available. Winter Wren: Abundance in North America increased from 1980 to 2003 (trend = 2.3%/year; P < 0.01, n = 742 routes; Sauer et al. 2004). 580 Appendix 4, Page 359 Song Sparrow: Abundance in North America remained st able from 1980 to 2003 (Sauer et al. 2004). State trends: Statewide trends from NABBS that include many other subspecies estimate that both Winter Wrens (trend = -1.4%/year; P = 0.14, n = 21 routes) and Song Sparrows (trend = -1.4%/year, P = 0.44, n = 31 routes) have declined in abundance from 1980 to 2003 (Sauer et al. 2004). Statewide trends for Rock Ptarmigan, Gray-crowned Rosy Finch, and McKay's Bunting are unknown. Introduced foxes have reduced population of Rock Ptarmigan on most of the Aleutian Islands and extirpated them from at least 6. Ptarmigan do increase in numbers following fox removal from islands; however, foxes have not been removed from all islands (Gibson and Byrd in prep). Subspecies of Winter Wrens and Song Sparrows endemic to the Aleutian Islands have been reduced in numbers from introduced foxes and rats. These subspecies have not responde d dramatically to removals of foxes, presumably because of continued predation from rats (Gibson and Byrd in prep; V. Byrd, personal communication). C. Problems, issues, or concerns for species group These taxa have extremely small population si zes and ranges that ar e restricted to a small number of islands. Therefore they are particularly susceptible to extirpation from disease, disturbance, and introduced predat ors. Introduction of mammals, particularly rats and foxes, to islands in the region is the largest concern. On many of the Aleutian Islands, Rock Ptarmigan, Winter Wrens, and Song Sparrows have already been extirpated or reduced in numbers from such introductions (Gibson and Byrd in prep.). Unintended introductions of rats from shi pping and fishing vessels are a continual high threat to populations even in areas with aggressive rat prevention programs (e.g., St. Paul Island). D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Habitats used by these subspecies are ge nerally intact. On the Pribilof Islands, introduced reindeer are degrading habitats used by Winter Wrens and Gray-crowned Rosy Finches. Habitats used by McKay's Buntings on St. Matthew Island have also been degraded by introduced reindeer; howev er, these ungulates have been absent from the island since the early 1980s. Contamination from military sites is a ch ronic issue throughout the Aleutian and Pribilof Islands, but its eff ects on populations of these bi rds is currently unknown. The primary factor that threatens this grou p of birds is introductions of mammalian predators, which have already greatly redu ced and even eliminated populations from islands. The entire breeding ranges of th ese taxa are encompassed by the Alaska Maritime Wildlife Refuge. Wintering and migration habitats for McKay' s Buntings along coas tal areas of western Alaska between Norton Sound and Bristol Bay are poorly known. Winter range for this 581 Appendix 4, Page 360 species includes large conservation units (Yukon Delta and Togi ak National Wildlife Refuges); however, many Native-owned land holdi ngs that lie within the administrative boundaries of these areas may pose deve lopment threats such as wind energy development. E. Concerns associated with key habitats See Section D. F. Goal: Ensure that Aleutian and Bering Sea endemic landbirds remain sustainable throughout their limited range w ithin natural population-level variation and historical distribution across Alaska. G. Conservation objectives and actions Objective 1 : On islands currently without introd uced mammalian predators (i.e., foxes and rats) maintain species widely distribut ed across the current range and within the range of natural population cycles. Target: Stable geographic breeding distri bution and population trend. For McKay's Bunting the target population size is the 2003 estimate of 34,000 breeding individuals (S.M. Matsuoka, unpublished data). Measure: Population trend estimated from periodic surveys. Issue 1a : Introduction of foxes, rats, reindeer, and other introduced mammals are the primary threat for these birds. Conservation action: Protect islands from introductions of foxes, rats, and reindeer. Issue 1b : Standardized surveys, such as the NABBS and ALMS, currently do not sample these islands with sufficient intensity to m onitor these bird taxa. Many of these islands are remote and therefore logistically chal lenging and expensive to sample. Introductions of foxes and rats are a conti nual threat. Little is known a bout demographics of any of these taxa. Conservation action: Design and implement surveys to measure breeding population size or an index of abundance periodically to estimate population trends. If surveys have already been conducted in key locations, they should be eval uated to determine if they provided a sound baseline of abundance or popula tion size. If so, such surveys should be resampled periodically and potentially expa nded so as to detect a 25% decline in population size over 10 years. If species are found to decline below 20% of current population size, investigate the causes of declines and develop remedial actions for both stabilizing populations and retu rning them to target levels. Issue 1c: Unlike the other avian taxa in this group, McKay's Buntings are migratory, leaving breeding islands to wi nter on the mainland coast of the Bering Sea in Alaska. Once outside of the islands on which they breed, they are subjected to several additional potential threats. This further compli cates the conservation of this species. 582 Appendix 4, Page 361 Conservation actions : a) For McKay's Buntings, identify key mi gration and wintering habitats and threats to populations du ring the nonbreeding season. In particular, assess the threat of wind turbines in coastal communities to wintering and migrating birds. b) Conduct mark-recapture study during wi nter to estimate survival and recruitment. Use demographic informa tion coupled with information from breeding studies on McKay's Buntings or similar species to develop population models to determine if deficits in adult survival, nesting success, or recruitment are most likely to cause populations to decline. Objective 2 : Increase population size on islands with introduced foxes and rats. Target: Suspected population size prior to in troduction of foxes and rats, or double current population size if such information is unavailable. Measure: Population trend estimated from periodic surveys. Issue 2a : Many of the islands with introduced foxes and rats are large and remote, making the removal of these exotic mammals extremely difficult and expensive. Conservation actions : a) Remove or reduce in number introduced rats and foxes from selected Aleutian Islands. b) Maintain and potentially expand current program to control, eradicate, and prevent introductions of exotic mammalian predators. c) Use results from recently initiated tests to eradicate rats from selected Aleutian Islands to develop and impl ement a strategy for the widespread removal of rats from the island system. d) Measure the efficacy of exotic species management by monitoring numerical and possibly demographic responses of birds to control and eradication efforts. e) Reintroduce Rock Ptarmigan to islands fr om which they have been extirpated following control or removal of foxes. H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats The USFWS'Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge will be a key partner in managing this group of birds, particularly th rough prevention, control, and eradications programs for introduced mammalian predator s, many of which are ongoing. The Yukon Delta and Togiak National Wildlife Refuge s and Native villages on western Alaska coast and the State of Alaska for lands on the northern Alaska Peninsula will be important partners for studying and conserving McKay's Buntings on migration and wintering grounds. I. Recommended time frame for reviewing species status and trends Ten years unless monitoring suggests that popu lation have fallen below target levels. 583 Appendix 4, Page 362 J.

Distribution and abundance Range : Global range comments: Breeds from northern Alaska, northern Y ukon Territory, and northern Mackenzie to southern Keewatin, northern Manit oba, and northern Ontario. Small disjunct population in extreme northwestern British Columbia and the uplands of southeastern-central Alaska. Breeding ra nge incompletely known but assumed to encompass suitable habitat across the tree -line west of James Bay to Alaska. Winter distribution limited to the southern great plains from Kansas and central Iowa south to Oklahoma, central Texa s, and northwestern Louisiana east to Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Alabama. High relative numbers of wintering birds in north-central a nd northeastern Okla homa (Grzybowski 1982; Dunn and Dunn 1999). State range comments: Found in 2 areas in Alaska: Brooks Range and northern foothills and uplands of southeastern-centr al Alaska. In the Brooks Range they are found as far west as the Noatak headwate rs (Kessel and Gibson 1978), and north to the confluence of the Colville and K ogosukruk Rivers (Johnson and Herter 1989). Considered a fairly common breeder in the eastern Brooks Range, at least as far west as Anaktuvuk Pass. Confirmed or proba ble breeder in the Kongakut, Sheenjek, Hulahula, Canning, Atigun, Sagavanirktok, and Ribdon river valleys. Uncommon to rare breeder west of Anaktuvuk Pass. Rare breeder or probable breeder in Wrangell Mountains, along Denali highway, Mt. Fair play area, Tanana-Yukon highlands and White Mountains (Ke ssel and Gibson 1978). Abundance : Global abundance comments: The total population size of Smith's Longspur is unknown, but breeding densities in suitable breeding habitat suggest it does not exceed 75,000 birds (Briskie 1993). Population size likely far less than this. State abundance comments: Unknown. Trends : Global trends: Unknown. State trends: Unknown. C. Problems, issues, or concerns for species Small population size coupled with restricted breeding and winter distribution makes this species particularly susceptible to population decline. Smith's Longspur is not 585 Appendix 4, Page 364 currently monitored by any of the North America's avian monitoring programs (Rich et al. 2004). This species uses grasslands during wi nter in a limited por tion of the southern Great Plains (Dunn and Dunn 1999), where la nd is primarily privately owned and heavily managed through grazing, burning, and frequent use of herbicides and pesticides. Breeding range in Alaska is incompletely known. Considered one of the more poorly studied birds in North America (Ehrlich et al. 1998). Factors controlling population size are unknown, although breed ing success is strongly affected by predation levels and climatic conditions (Briskie 1993). D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Isolated breeding areas largely protect this species from direct human disturbance during part of the year. In northern Alaska in the Brooks Range, prefers moist tussock meadows in wide alpine valleys, often surroundi ng lakes. In centra l Alaska prefers dry ridgetop tundra (Kessel and Gibson 1978). Elsewhere found at treeline. May be found in low areas of tundra interspersed with spruce. During winter this species is gregarious and can be one of the most common grassland birds in north-central an d northeastern Oklahoma (Grzybowski 1982; Dunn and Dunn 1999), where it specializes in using specific heavily grazed fields of short grasses, mostly silver beardgrass (Andropongon saccharoide s) interspersed with three awn grass (Aristida sp., Grzybowski 1980; Dunn and D unn 1999). Favored fields appear to have some patches of tall grasses mixed among the pa tches of shorter grass typically used by birds foraging on the ground (Dunn and Dunn 1999). The species is commonly found near airports, pastures, and re gularly cut hayfields, sometime s near lakes, streams, or damp areas (Briskie 1993; Dunn and Dunn 1999). E. Concerns associated with key habitats No immediate threats to breed ing habitats used in Alaska. Some concerns in Alaska include: Changes in the distribution and condition of favored breeding habitat, such as drying of alpine meadows and advance of treeline, resulting from climate change. Accumulation of persistent organic pollu tants a concern across breeding range. Threat primarily on wintering grounds, where th e species is concentrated within a small portion of the southern Great Plains where favored grasslands are heavily managed for agricultural uses. F. Goal: Ensure Smith's Longspur populations remain sustainable throughout their range within natural population-leve l variation and historical distribution across Alaska. G. Conservation objectives and actions State conservation and management needs : Objective : Maintain species widely distributed acr oss the current range and at a level of abundance that is + 20% of current populat ion size in Alaska. Target: Stable geographic breeding distri bution and population trend in Alaska. Measure: Distribution and population trend esti mated from periodic surveys of breeding birds. 586 Appendix 4, Page 365 Issue 1 : Low breeding densities, patchy dist ribution, and difficulty in surveying populations using existing broad-scale monito ring programs limits the ability to manage and conserve Alaska populations of this species (BPIF 1999). Monitoring surveys will likely need to be designed specifically for this species to overcome these obstacles. General lack of specific information on the br eeding distribution and habitat associations in Alaska severely hampers the ability to design effective surveys for this species. Conservation actions : a) A high priority is to extend the sy stematic-random inventory of montane- nesting birds conducted in the Brooks Range (R.E. Gill, Jr., unpublished data) eastward into the Arctic National W ildlife Refuge. This would be an important inventory to enumerate po pulation size in northern Alaska and identify important geographic locations a nd habitats for this species in Alaska. This survey should be completed by 2006 so as to be directly comparable to similar data already collected in the western Brooks Range (R.E. Gill, Jr., unpublished data). b) Once these surveys are completed, conduct a thorough evaluation of the breeding distribution and habitat use of this species in Alaska based on the Brooks Range inventory, information from Kessel and Gibson (1978), and other standardized surveys conducted as part of the NABBS, Alaska Off-road Breeding Bird Survey (Handel 2000), AL MS, and other intensive inventories of birds (Swanson and Nigro 2003) w ithin the species breeding range. Observations of Smith's Longspurs from these surveys should be examined to assess the relative importance of differe nt geographic areas and habitats in supporting breeding population of this species, with the results used to develop objectives for conserving br eeding areas for this species. c) Develop methods for monitoring change s in population size either through intensive local studies in areas with predictable c oncentrations, or through extensive surveys of key habitats acro ss representative parts of the breeding range in Alaska (i.e., eastern Brooks Range). Information on distribution and habitat use will undoubtedly help the design of such surveys. Consider resampling existing surveys (i.e., eastern Brooks Range) when appropriate. d) Conduct demographic studies in areas with high concentrations of this species to collect baseline information on annua l survival and reproductive success and identify factors affecting reprodu ction. Compare such information to similar data collected from breeding popul ations in Churchill and possibly use data from both Churchill and Alaska to model how deficits in survival, reproduction, or recruitmen t are likely to effect ra tes of population growth. Issue 2 : Potential accumulation of persistent or ganic pollutants a concern across breeding range. Conservation action: Conduct assessment of exposure to persistent organic pollutants in breeding range. 587 Appendix 4, Page 366 Global conservation and management needs : Objective : Maintain the species widely dist ributed across the global breeding and wintering range at population sizes w ithin the range of natural cycles. Target: Stable geographic breeding distribution and population trend. Measure: Distribution and population trend esti mated from periodic surveys of breeding and/or wintering birds. Issue 1 : Current surveys of birds on winter ing areas may already be monitoring population trends for this species. However, these data have not been sufficiently evaluated. Conservation actions : a) Evaluate data from the CBC to determine if this survey is already adequate for monitoring changes in distribution a nd population size of Smith's Longspurs on wintering grounds. Data from this su rvey already go back continuously to the early 1950s, so this survey may already be tracking gross changes in population size. b) Develop and test wi nter surveys for monitoring ch anges in population size if the CBC is proven inadequate in monitoring trends. Issue 2 : Species has small population size and oc curs both in the United States and Canada. Conservation actions : a) Improve communication among Alaska n and Canadian biologists, conservationists, land managers, and policymakers and develop long-term plans for the conservation of this species across its limited range. b) A priority within this should be to c onduct literature reviews or studies to assess threats to birds across enti re breeding and nonbreeding range. An assessment of threats on the wintering range should be undertaken first as distribution is limited to areas that are intensively managed. Issue 3 : Species has extremely limited wintering range in the southern Great Plain centered in Oklahoma. This area is heavily managed for livestock and agriculture, with much land under private ownership. Conservation actions : a) Increase the amount of grassland area in preserves in key wintering areas. b) Encourage the development of land ma nagement policies and practices in wintering areas that protect and enha nce habitats for Smith's Longspurs, particularly on private lands. H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats Surveys in Alaska should be coordinated between key conservation units (i.e., USFWS' Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, NPS' Central and Northern Park complexes), appropriate research (i.e., USGS' Alaska Science Center) and conservation (i.e., USFWS' Migratory Bird Management) agencies. 588 Appendix 4, Page 367 Rangewide conservation of this species w ill need to be coordinated among several federal, provincial, state, and nongovernment al agencies; notably the USFWS (Regions 2, 3, 4, 6, 7), the Canadian Wildlife Service, USGS, Fish and Game (Alaska, Arkansas, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas), and appropriate universities and nongovernmental agencies (Bird Studies Canada, Boreal Songbird Ini tiative, Sutton Avian Research Center). Evaluations of trend data from the CBC may include National Audubon Society and the USGS' Patuxent Wildlife Research Center among others. I. Recommended time frame for reviewing species status and trends Ten years unless evaluation of distribution in Alaska or estimates of population trend from the CBC or other surveys suggest populations may be in decline.

However, the state is also home to numerous other mammals, including the tiniest species, the bats and shrews. At mee tings held in April 2004, wildlife experts were asked to identify those mammal species havi ng important conservation concerns and to recommend a selection of them to feature in th e CWCS. This task was formidable due to the paucity of information for so many of Alaska's lesser-known mammal species. Experts pointed out that, rega rdless of their conservation st atus and available funding, many of Alaska's nonmarine mammals are technically considered game species and covered in the annual Alaska Hunting Regulatio ns booklet. These include a number of species that many, if not most, Alaskans typically do not consider to be game, such as shrews, mice, crows, and snowy owls. Also, Alaska's legal definition of game covers all birds, reptiles, and mammals, except those that are domesticated; thus, it appears that there are no nongame birds, reptiles, or mammals. Animals classified as game by st ate regulations can be used in both game- related (e.g., hunting) and nongame -related (e.g., viewing) ways. Ultimately, the experts focused on conservation concerns for terrestrial mammals without regard to their technical status. For example, under the state's trapping regulations, there is no bag limit for hoary marmots ( Marmota caligata). But ( M. c. sheldoni ), which was last seen at the turn of the 20th century and was described as an endemic of Montague Isla nd. Even though they are technically a \"game\" species, marmots on Montague Island are consid ered a species of conservation concern due to their limited range (endemism), risk of extinction (because they are a small population on an island), and lack of recent sightin gs (possibly extinct or cryptic). The Montague Island marmot also provides a goo d example of other major issues regarding the inventory of terrestrial mammals of c onservation concern in Alaska: endemism and uncertain taxonomy. Many of the state's land ma mmal species have been described as island endemics, which by definition are at higher risk of extinction than other species. However, the taxonomic validity of these species has not been investigated or confirmed/refuted. Until the phylogeographical history of these species or populations is understood, we cannot understand their distribution. This information, together with abundance and productivity data, is essential for comprehensiv ely identifying species at risk. The experts began by consider ing and melding 2 previous ly compiled lists: 1) a comprehensive list of species and subspecies of conservation concern including their known distribution and agency classifi cation (MacDonald et al. in prep ), and 2) a proposed species of concern list developed by experts for the USFWS in May 2003. This combined list (Table 4.1, below) represents species, subspecies and sp ecies groups that merit consideration of their taxonomy, distribution, abundance, productivit y, and risk factors. Achieving better understanding of the status of these taxa w ill bring us closer to the overall goal of maintaining biodiversity among Al aska's terrestrial mammals. 591 Appendix 4, Page 370 Table 4.1 Land mammal taxa of conservation concern.

Rare taxa included island endemic species and subspecies , disjunct populations, and/or populations believed to be in decline. Natural and st ochastic risk included genetic drift, natural disasters, disease, and climate change. Anthr opogenic risk included habitat modification, human encroachment, defense of life or property, and introduction of exotic species. Experts generated conservation objectives, targets, measures, and actions for each featured mammal species or species group. Th e experts applied the criteria shown in Section II(C), and also selected the Chis ana caribou herd and the Kenai Peninsula population of brown bears as being of concern. The experts felt that existing management plans for these populations did not adequa tely address the po pulations' long-term conservation needs. Chisana caribou herd The Chisana caribou herd is a small populati on of caribou inhabiting east-central Alaska, USA, and southwest Yukon, Canada. The herd summers almost entirely in Alaska and winters in Yukon. The herd began an abrupt decline in 1989 from about 1800 animals to an estimated 360 in 2001. While recent, more extensive surveys indicate that the population size may be higher than indicated by earlier surveys, observations of extremely low calf survival (5-10%) substa ntiate significant c ontinued decline and possible extirpation. The taxonomy of the herd is somewhat uncertain. In Canada the herd falls under the classification of woodland caribou ( Rangifer tarandus caribou ), but in Alaska all caribou populations have been classifi ed as barren-ground caribou ( R. t. granti ). They are designated as Northern Mountain ecotype based on ecological behavior and body characteristics, as are all other woodla nd caribou of Yukon and northwestern British Columbia by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada. Information on the genetic status of th e herd, using microsatellite DNA (msDNA) analysis, indicates that they are a genetic ally distinct populati on exhibiting msDNA far distant from that of adjacent caribou herds in Yukon and Alaska (Zittlau et al.). This information suggests that there are 2 subspecies in Alaska, rather than one, and it ascribes special significance for this herd. These even ts prompted designation of the herd as a specially protected wildlife population under the Yukon Wildlife Act in 2002. This action includes a prohibition on all hunting, including su bsistence harvest. Al l hunting of this herd is also prohibited in Alaska. A conser vation plan was devel oped that included an ongoing effort to reduce predation on new borns through predator exclusion during periods of high vulnerability. This effort includes capturing, penning, and feeding of parturient females in Canada for 10 weeks beginning just before calving. Cows and calves are released after calves obtain sufficient size to avoid predation. Several other small caribou herds in the state of Alaska are thought to be at historically low population sizes. For example, the Me ntasta, Sunshine Mountains, Beaver 596 Appendix 4, Page 375 Mountains, Rainy Pass, Tonzona and Big River-Farewell herds each likely consist of only a few hundred animals. Biologists suspec ted that the remnants of one such herd (Kilbuck Mountains) was recently assimilated into a larger herd, or was extirpated by other factors, and in 2002 recommended th at management efforts cease (ADF&G 2003). Although management plans exist for all cu rrent populations, there is insufficient information for the long-term conservation of these populations. This is because: 1) genetic, taxonomic, and population identity information is weak or nonexistent for many small herds; 2) basic population data is w eak or absent; 3) the ultimate causes and magnitudes of continued population declines are unknown; and 4) the potential for caribou to naturally recolonize these areas is unknown as are the conditions and mechanisms under which such recolonization might occur. If an appropriate funding source can be identified, additional work to address these conservation concerns is recommended. Brown bear, Kenai Peninsula population Brown bears on the Kenai Peninsula were desi gnated as a state species of concern in 1998. This administrative designation proactivel y focused attention and research efforts on an area where steady human population grow th and increased human activities had potential to negatively impact the bears. A Kenai Brown Bear Conservation Strategy was created (ADF&G 2000), and great strides have been made in accomplishing some of the strategies' goals. The Kenai Brown Bear Co mmittee has recently outlined an action plan for addressing the most critical issu es affecting Kenai brown bears. The many uncertainties regarding the health and size of the brown bear population, the influence of growing human development, the potential insular qualities of the peninsula, and an apparent increase in human-bear inte ractions warrant an aggressive approach toward managing for the conservation of the brown bear population on the Kenai Peninsula. Four steps are critical to improving Kenai brown bear conservation: First, managers must assess population si ze, distribution, and structure of brown bears across the peninsula so that a Population Viability Analysis can be conducted. Second, Kenai residents and vi sitors must continue to be informed about special requirements of brown bears and ho w to minimize human-bear conflict. Third, a strategic garbage-management pol icy must be developed on the peninsula to minimize bear-human conflicts. Finally, land use management strategies that consider brow n bear foraging and habitat requirements and minimize potenti al for human-bear interactions are needed to ensure the conservation of this bear population. Agencies or organizations that could play a role in developing and implementing such strategies include the DOT&PF, Kenai Peninsula Borough planning division, and Cook Inlet Region Inc., which owns a la rge piece of prope rty along the Kenai River. 597 Appendix 4, Page 376 Literature Cited ADF&G. 2000.

Distribution and abundance Range : Global range comments: North America (Hall 1981; van Zyll de Jong and Nagorsen 1994; Nagorsen and Brigham 1993). M. keenii may have the most restricted range of any North American bat (van Zyll de Jong 1985). State range comments: All are limited to Southeast Alaska, except for M. lucifugus, which has also been documented in South central, northern Southwestern, and Central Alaska (MacDonald and Cook 1996; Park er and Cook 1996; Parker et al. 1997). Abundance : Global abundance comments: Keen's bat is represented in museum collections by only 59 specimens (van Zyll de Jong and Nagorsen 1994) and is Red-listed in British Columbia (precursor to listing as endangered or threatened), as SC (particularly sensitive to human activities or natura l events) by COSEWIC, and as G2G3 (imperiled or rare or uncommon) by th e AKNHP. All other species are ranked G5 (widespread, abundant, and secure) by AKHNP. State abundance comments: Unknown. M. keenii is known only from 2 records in the Alexander Archipelago of Southeast Alaska, M. californicus by 5 records, M. volans by 5 records, and L. noctivagans by only 4 records. M. lucifugus may be relatively common in the narrow belt of temperate forest along the state's southern coasts as far west as Kodiak Island and adjacent Alaska Peninsula.

Problems, issues, or concerns for species group Lack of information on these species' lif e history, population st ructure, migration patterns, distribution, and habitat use Destruction of karst and old-growth habitat due to timber harvests Changes in foraging, roosting, breeding, and hibernaculum habitat associated with timber harvest Pesticide use 599 Appendix 4, Page 378 D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Karst features, such as caves, on Prince of Wales and other islands (unknown and variable conditions; substantial degradation in heavily harvested areas). Some of the caves may harbor maternity colonies Commuting and feeding activity is greatest in old-growth forest and riparian habitats; bat activity in clearcuts and second growth is low to very low (Parker et al. 1996) Decaying standing trees may provide roosting habitat (winter, summer, maternity; Fischbach et al. in prep) E. Concerns associated with key habitats See Section C Habitat is narrowly and patchily distributed Timber harvest focused on rare stands of largest trees Salvage logging is focused on possible roost trees Conversion to second growth; bat use of second growth is low (Parker et al. 1996) Karst destruction F. Goal: Ensure that southcoastal bat populati ons remain sustainable throughout their range within natural population-level variation rela tive to presumed historical distribution in Alaska. G. Conservation objectives and actions Objective : Maintain the current distribution, dive rsity, and abundance of bat species and populations in sout hcoastal Alaska. Target: Fully documented occurrence, distribu tion, and abundance of these species. Measures : Diversity, population trends, a nd distribution maps of species. Issue 1: Lack of information on these species ' occurrence, abundance, home ranges, migration habits (e.g., whether th ey migrate), and destinations. Conservation actions : a) Increase our knowledge of bat distri bution and ecology in southcoastal Alaska. b) Document distribution and occurrence in Southeast Alaska. c) Inventory using techniques specific for bats; it is often economical to study multiple bat species at once. d) Inventory key habitats, iden tify critical habitat areas. e) Document distribution and abundance in second-growth habitat; further investigate occurrence and abundance in old-growth and second-growth habitats. f) Provide scientific samples to natu ral history museums for phylogeographic and taxonomic studies. g) Measure home range of each species. 600 Appendix 4, Page 379 Issue 2: Old-growth forests and karst features are presumed to be prime bat habitat. Conservation actions : a) Measure bat use in forest types to id entify important hab itats (e.g., roosting, breeding, foraging habitat). b) Measure bat use of karst features (caves ) to identify important habitats (e.g. roosting, breeding, foraging, hibernacula habitat). Issue 3: Effects of some timber actions on habitat quality for bats are unknown. Conservation actions : a) Evaluate habitat quality of forest seral stages. b) Evaluate the potential to manage for ol d-growth forest structure and function. Issue 4: Effects of pesticides on bats and their prey are unknown. Conservation action: Determine the effects of pesticides use. H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats Collect all the data necessary to do a populat ion viability study for all southcoastal Alaska bat species. Design a long-term m onitoring strategy every 2 years between USFWS, USFS and ADF&G to include a trend analysis. I.

Problems, issues, or concerns for species group Invalid taxonomies fail to adequately re flect the region's diversity; preliminary studies suggest existing taxonomic fram eworks underestimate or incorrectly characterize diversity in some cases Incomplete distributional and status information Need to better evaluate assumptions of the Tongass National Forest - Forest Plan (TLMP) conservation strategy to maintain viable and well-distributed populations Timber harvest and road construction leading to habitat loss and fragmentation Increased access and potential overexploitati on by trappers (marten, ermine, beaver) Isolated endemics of presumed sma ll population size (hi gher probability of 603 Appendix 4, Page 382 extinction than mainland) Genetic swamping of island endemics by the introduction of nonnative species (e.g., Martes americana americana occurring on islands where the Martes americana caurina is endemic) Pesticide contamination related to forest management practices Introduction of potential competitors/preda tors (e.g., red squirrel, raccoon, brown rat) D. Location and condition of ke y or important habitat areas Marten are closely affiliated with high qualit y, old-growth forests (particularly the rare big-tree stands). Flying squirre ls are associated with matu re forests and likely limited by large trees and snags in less productive p eatland mixed-conifer forest associations. Condition of these habitats in Southeast Alaska ranges from very degraded across broad areas of the archipelago that have experienced industrial timber harvest to very good or pristine in forest stands unaffected by timber harvest or community and road development. E. Concerns associated with key habitats Stands of big trees are ra re and disproportionately harvested over time; species associated with stands of big trees may be disproportionately impacted by past and future harvest. Connectivity may be disrupted by habitat fragmentation. F. Goal: Ensure Southeast Alaska endemic small mammal populations remain sustainable throughout their range within natural population-level variation and historical distribution across Alaska. G. Conservation objectives and actions Objective : Maintain distribution an d diversity of endemic ta xa and distinct population segments. Target: Maintenance of endemic populations in current distribution and/or restoration of populations imp acted by anthropogenic causes. Measure (1) : Survey of island occurrence. Measure (2) : Determination of taxonomic status. Issue 1 : Invalid taxonomies and insufficient distribution data. Conservation actions : a) Conduct surveys. b) Collect and archive samples for taxonomic and genetic analyses. c) Support phylogeographic studies of endemic taxa. Issue 2 : Habitat loss and fragmentation. 604 Appendix 4, Page 383 Conservation actions : a) Evaluate habitat relationships. b) Evaluate dispersal (li nkage and corridors). c) Recommend management strategies (based on above information). d) Make the southern outer islands subregion (Prince of Wales Island complex) with its elevated levels of endemism a priority area of conservation concern and action. Issue 3: Pesticide contamination. Conservation action: Evaluate impacts of pesticide contamination on small endemic mammal populations. H.

Concerns associated with key habitats Possible threat from feral or introduced predators or competitors. Possible habitat degradation from livesto ck grazing and/or other introductions on some islands. Warming climate may threaten habitat. F. Goal: Ensure Southwest Alaska/Bering Sea insular endemic small mammals remain sustainable throughout their range within natural population-level variation and historical distribution in Alaska. G. Conservation objectives and actions Objective : Acquire a full understanding of populat ion and/or taxonomic distinctness and habitat use to conserve these taxa. Target: Measures of the genetic distinctness of the known taxa and screening for potentially undetected subpopulations; delineation of the habi tat requirements. Measure: Estimates of genetic divergence with small confidence intervals. Populations maintain present and histor ical distributions. (Absolute population size and/or density will likely be difficu lt to understand even with several years' data.) Issue : Population densities are cycl ical and/or irruptive, and extent of habitat use is greater at higher population densities; therefor e, short-term estimations of density and extent of habitat are not predictive. Conservation actions : a) Collect and archive material for genetic analyses. b) Conduct genetic and taxonomic analyses. c) Develop fine-scale delineation of the geographic occurrence. 609 Appendix 4, Page 388 H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats An immediate intensive effort of 4 years dur ation to (a) acquire material for genetic analysis and (b) establish the extent of variability in population density and habitat use. USFWS is a potential partner because mo st species occur on the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. Determination of extinction risk to the southernmost populations of collared lemmings is a prio rity, because of global climate change. I.

Problems, issues, or concerns for species Potential Extirpation or extinction Predation by brown bears Forest habitat modification Isolation: island endemic Vulnerability to population effects due to disease or other stochastic factors D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Believed to be restricted to timberline regions of Montague Island (NatureServe 2000), Montague Island marmots also may use talus slopes at lower elevations (Holbrook 1999). However, hoary marm ots on neighboring Hinchinbrook Island, Prince William Sound, are typically f ound on the beach during the summer months. Vancouver Island marmots prefer subalpin e meadows but also have been found occupying steep cliffs, talus, open meadow s with southern exposure, and logging- slash areas (Bryant and Janz 1996; Dearden 1986; Heard 1977). Condition of key or important habita t areas for this species is unknown. E. Concerns associated with key habitats Since the late 1980s, Vancouver Island marmot populations have undergone a documented population decline of 60-70 per cent (Bryant 1998). Bryant (1996) found reduced persistence of Vanc ouver Island marmots occupying clearcuts, and survival rates were significantly lower in second-grow th stands more than 11 years old (Bryant 1998). Moreover, the population \"sink\" phe nomenon exhibited in clearcuts limited sources for recolonization of natural habitats. Vancouver Island marmot populations became concentrated, further reducing the probability of survival by making colonies more susceptible to predat ors and disease (Bryant 1998). F. Goal: Determine if Montague Island marmot popul ations exist, and if so, ensure that they remain sustainable throughout their limited range within natural population variation. 611 Appendix 4, Page 390 G. Conservation objectives and actions Objective : Determine if any Montague Island marmots still exist, and if so, obtain sufficient population, distributi on, trend, habitat, and taxonomic information to assist in conservation of the species. Target: Complete understanding of occurrence, distributi on, population size, trends, habitat use, and taxonomy. Measure(1) : Validation of occurrence and documentation of distribution Measure(2) : Index of population size and monitoring of trends Measure(3) : Determination/delineation of habitat use Measure(4) : Validation of taxonomy. Issue 1 : The current status is unknown; Montague Island marmots are possibly extinct or extirpated. Conservation actions : a) Conduct helicopter surveys in spring and foot surveys in early summer to validate occurrence and document distribution. b) Collect genetic material to validate taxonomy. Issue 2: Habitat use by marmots is unknown. Monta gue Island habitat modification has been underway for some time and may continue; timber is on a rotation schedule. Conservation action: Determine habitat associati ons and islandwide distribution. Issue 3: Predation, hunting, and disease may or may not be an issue, and scale of this may be dependent on hunting regulations; in flated brown bear populations and deer introductions may cause adverse effects. Hoary marmots are managed by ADF&G as a furbearer (Alaska Board of Game 1998-99) ; there is no closed season or bag limit. Conservation action: Consider regulatory actions related to hunting and trapping seasons for marmots on Montague Island. Issue 4: Introduction of exotics (pas t and future) can adversely affect genetics and survival of indigenous marmots. Conservation action: Restrict any further mamma lian introductions on Montague Island until marmot i ssues are resolved. Issue 5: Marmots may act as reservoirs for dis eases, such as tularemia and sylvatic plague, and may harbor the tick vectors of other diseases, such as Lyme disease and babesiosis (Eadie 1954). Conservation action: Conduct parasitology marmots. 612 Appendix 4, Page 391 H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats Helicopter survey to verify existence s hould be conducted as soon as possible, e.g., as early as spring of 2005. Population trend should be monitored annually for 10 years. Habitat study and taxonomic evaluation should be conducted upon verifying that these marmots still exist. The USFS, USFWS, University of Al aska Museum, and Chugach Alaska Corporation are possible partners. I.

Species group description Common names: Kenai red squirrel Forested habitat of Kenai Peni nsula (red squirrel, marten). Abundance : Unknown for red squirrels; presumably a bundant where they occur. Marten are considered rare west of the Kenai Mount ains in Game Management Unit (GMU) 15 on the Kenai Peninsula (ADF&G 1978). In GMU 7, east of the Kenai Mountains, approximately 70 marten are harvested on an annual basis (T. McDonough, ADF&G, personal communication). Trends : No data for red squirrels or marten. Based on trapping data, marten populations fluctuate every 3 to 5 years (T. McD onough, ADF&G, personal communication). C. Problems, issues, or concerns for species group Existing Forest loss due to bark beetle infestation on unprecedented scale Potential Replacement of standing forest with grasslands. Different forest management practices ma y have different effects on red squirrels and marten and their forage and prey sp ecies (e.g., salvage lo gging vs. burning). Declines in squirrel popul ation could adversely affect predators (e.g., goshawk). Small, isolated populations of marten may be at ri sk from habitat loss and overtrapping. 614 Appendix 4, Page 393 D. Location and condition of ke y or important habitat areas Spruce forests (existing and historical); habita t condition is degraded to very degraded as a result of extensive bark beetle infestation on the Kenai Peninsula. E. Concerns associated with key habitats See section C above. F. Goal: Ensure Kenai Peninsula endemic small mammals remain sustainable throughout their range within natural popul ation-level variati on and limited historic al distribution in Alaska. G. Conservation objectives and actions Objective : Acquire a full understanding of populati on and/or taxonomic distinctness and a delineation of habitat usage to in form management decision-making. Target: Complete understanding of red s quirrel and marten distribution and demographics on the Kenai Peninsula. Measure(1) : Index of genetic and/or taxonomic uniqueness relative to mainland populations of red squirrels and marten. Measure(2) : Determination of density of red squirrels and marten by habitat type. Issue 1 : The current distribution a nd abundance of red squirrel s or marten on the Kenai Peninsula is unknown, particularly in re lation to forest landscape change. Conservation actions : a) Conduct inventories for re d squirrels throughout the Kenai Peninsula, saving voucher specimens for archival in an accredited natural history collection. b) Gather harvest information on Kenai ma rten and obtain carcasses and tissue samples from trappers for archival at a natural history museum. c) Conduct studies that estimate density of red squirrel and marten in various habitat types; a landscape level analysis can then be conducted to determine effects of change in forested habitats. Issue 2 : The level of genetic isolation and taxonomic distinctness are unknown for Kenai populations. Conservation action: Conduct standard phylogeographic and/or population genetic assessment. H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats Conduct inventory for red squirrels across the Kenai Peninsula. Gather harvest information on Kenai marten. Collect voucher sp ecimens of both species to be archived (including frozen tissues), and perform phyloge ographic and population genetics studies.

The first task was to determine which species or species group would be included in the CWCS. The group acknowledged th at although all marine mammals in the waters off Alaska fit some or many of the established criteria, they could not all be included in the first iteration of the CWCS. The group decided to include those ma rine mammals that have (1) very little information available on their population status an d basic biology and life history and (2) been listed under the Endangered Species Act as either \"Endangered\" or \"Threatened,\" or designated as \"Depleted\" under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The group decided not to include Steller sea lions, northern fur seals, or the AT 1 group of transient killer whales because they believed these species would be added to subseq uent revisions of the CWCS, and that ongoing efforts to revise their recovery or conservation plans would focu s attention on their status and promote needed conservation actions. The omission of these 3 species in the current CWCS is not intended to indicate that the actions needed to promote their conserva tion are in any way less important than those for speci es featured in the CWCS. The group believed that attention needed to be directed to those marine mammals that are dependent on ice for a substantial portion of thei r annual life cycle, especially because of the impact of global climate change in the Arctic, a nd thus created the \"ice dependent\" species group that includes polar bear, walrus , bearded seal, ringed seal, ri bbon seal, and spotted seal. Two other species groups were created, beaked whales and large whales, with additional templates written for each of 3 of the endangered large whales (i.e., right, bowhead, humpback). The remaining 2 templates were written for the Cook In let stock of beluga whales and the southwest stock of northern sea otters, both of which have experienced dramatic population declines over the last decade with no curre nt indication of recovery. The primary source of information on the range, a bundance, and trend used in the templates were the Alaska marine mammal stock assessment reports (SARs) compiled by NOAA Fisheries and USFWS. Although this information is based on nu merous scientific publications, the template bibliographies list only the SARs. The other main sources of information used in the templates were conservation and recovery plans, yet for so me species (e.g., beaked whales, ice seals) very little information is available. 620 Appendix 4, Page 399 Cook Inlet Beluga Whale A. Species description Common name : Cook Inlet beluga; white whale Scientific name: Delphinapterus leucas B. Distribution and abundance Range : Global range comments: circumpolar for species (IUCN 1991) State range comments: Five stocks in Alaska: Beaufo rt Sea, Eastern Chukchi Sea, Eastern Bering Sea, Bris tol Bay, and Cook Inlet Abundance : Global abundance comments: 50,000 - 70,000 animals (IUCN 1991) State abundance comments: Greater than 40,000 among 5 stocks (Angliss and Lodge 2003) Cook Inlet abundance: 357 animals (Hobbs, et al. 2000) Trends: Global trends: Some populations are clearly much depleted and require adequate management for recovery. (IUCN 1991) Stoc k that occupies western Hudson Bay in summer is thought to be large and stable, de spite a substantial ha rvest; the effect of hydroelectric development on the estuarine habi tat of this stock is unknown; status of the southern Hudson Bay stock should be reviewed when more information on its size, relationship to other stocks, and harves t levels becomes available. The Southeast Baffin Island population is thought to be declining. State trends: 5 stocks: Bristol Bay stable or increasing, Eastern Bering Sea trend unknown, Eastern Chukchi Sea no evidence of d eclines, Eastern Beau fort Sea stable or increasing, Cook Inlet Beluga declining (Angliss and Lodge 2003) Cook Inlet trends: During 1994 - 1998 the st ock declined by over 50%, and there has been no indication of a recovery since re gulation of the subsis tence harvest began (Angliss and Lodge 2003) in 1999. C. Problems, issues, or concerns for species Cook Inlet Beluga (CIB) stock (IUCN/SSC Cetacean Specialist Group 2003) CIB population is small and has declined by 50% over past 10 years.

Species group description Common name(s) : ice-associated marine mammals: polar bear, walrus, bearded seal, ringed seal, (Angliss and Lodge 2004) Range : Global range comments: Polar Bear - Circumpolar, 20 relatively distinct populations. Use ice and terrestrial habitats. Walrus - 2 subspecies: Pacific walrus ( O. (O. r. rosmarus ). For Atlantic walrus, there are 4 eastern Canadian Arctic stocks, 2 Greenland stocks, and one stoc k in the Svalbard and Franz Josef Land archipelagos. For Pacific walrus , one stock is currently recognized, ranging throughout the continental shelf waters of the Bering and Chukchi seas, occasionally moving into the East Siberian and Beaufort seas. Use ice and terrestrial haulouts. Bearded seal - Circumpolar, from the Arctic Ocean (85 degrees north) south to Hokkaido (45 degrees north) in th e western Pacific Ocean. Generally inhabit areas that are less than 200 m deep and seasonally ice covered. During winter they are most common in broken p ack ice, yet in some areas they also inhabit shorefast ice. They do not haul out on land. Ringed seal - Circumpolar, from ~35 degrees north to the North Pole, occurring in all seas of the Arctic Oc ean. Inhabit ice-covered waters and are well adapted to occupying shorefast and pack ice; they do not haul out on land. Ribbon seal - North Pacific Ocean and adjacent fringes of the Arctic Ocean. Occur primarily in open seas and on pack ice, rarely on shorefast ice. Prefer broken pack ice and do not haul out on land. 626 Appendix 4, Page 405 Spotted seal - Distributed along the continental shelf of the Beaufort, Chukchi, Bering, and Okhotsk seas sout h to the northern Yellow Sea and western Sea of Japan. Prefer broken ice a nd ice edge habitats, but will haul out on land in summer. State range comments: Polar bear - 2 stocks recognized: Southern Beaufort Sea stock, and Chukchi/Bering seas stock, which overl ap between Point Barrow and Point Hope, centered near Point Lay. Pacific walrus - Bering and Chukchi seas. Bearded seal - Over the continenta l shelf of the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort seas Ringed seal - Bering, Chukc hi, and Beaufort seas. Ribbon seal - Aleutian Islands, Bristol Bay, Bering and Chukchi seas, western Beaufort Sea. Spotted seal - Bering, Chukc hi, and Beaufort seas. Abundance : Global abundance comments: Polar Bear - 21,500-25,000 Walrus - unknown Bearded seal - unknown Ringed seal - unknown Ribbon seal - unknown Spotted seal - unknown State abundance comments: Polar Bear - Southern Beaufort Sea stock: 2272 based on data for the 1986- 1998 period; Chukchi/Bering Seas stock: unknown Pacific Walrus - reliable estimates not available; USFWS will conduct Bering Sea population assessment in 2006-07 Bearded seal - unknown Ringed seal - unknown Ribbon seal - unknown Spotted seal - unknown Trends : Global trends: Polar bear - unknown for some populations , stable or decreasing for others Walrus - unknown Bearded seal - unknown Ringed seal - unknown Ribbon seal - unknown Spotted seal - unknown 627 Appendix 4, Page 406 State trends: Polar bear - Beaufort Sea stoc k: likely stable; Chukchi/Bering Seas stock: unknown Pacific walrus - unknown Bearded seal - unknown Ringed seal - unknown Ribbon seal - unknown Spotted seal - unknown C. Problems, issues, or concerns for species group (USFWS 1994a, 1994b and 1995) Little is known about population size and trends for most species, although more is known for the polar bear Global climate change will reduce sea ice extent and thickness, thus reducing available habitat Potential increases in shipping and fishing activities in habitats important for ice- associated species Coastal development, such as oil and gas exploration Contaminants, especially airborne cont aminants transported to the Arctic Potential for unsustainable harv est of polar bears in Alaska D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas All species associated with ice at some time of the year in the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort seas. Spotted seals are not associated with ice during the summer but haul out on land at specific locations along the western and north ern coasts of Alaska. E. Concerns associated with key habitats (USFWS 1994a, 1994b and 1995) Changes in sea ice extent/thickne ss related to climate change Coastal development Potential increased shipping and fishing activities F. Goal: Maintain sustainable populations within the range of OSP and as significant functioning element of the marine ecosystem. G. Conservation objectives and actions State conservation and management needs : Objective : Conserve and sustain Al aska's ice-associated marine mammals through a comprehensive program of scientific rese arch, co-management with Alaska Native organizations, and international mana gement and conservation efforts. Target: Gain adequate scientific informati on and establish appropriate management mechanisms to predict and respond to changes in marine mammal populations resulting from ecosystem changes. Measure: Current data on distribution, population size, and habitat use for ice associated marine mammals, continued co-management, and development of predictive mechanisms for assessing expected changes in sea ice extent and thickness. 628 Appendix 4, Page 407 Issue 1 : Information on this species group is limited, which restricts our ability to develop a conservation strategy. Specifically, information is needed for all species on abundance, trends, and habitat requirements, and for some species, data is needed on distribution and life history. In addition, specie s are widely distributed, and in some cases migratory, requiring internati onal cooperative efforts. Conservation actions: a) Establish (for ice seals) and expand (for walrus and polar bear) international collaborative research efforts to doc ument habitat use/needs; abundance and distribution of all species; life history traits, includi ng diet, fecundity, survival, etc.; disease occurrence and exposure; a nd contaminant levels. It is important that efforts be made to minimize the potential adverse effects of research. b) Determine population size/trends when possible (no techniques or funds currently available for monitoring ringed, bearded seals). c) Compare life history traits, such as ag e at sexual maturity, fecundity, age structure, etc., with historical data. d) Assess abundance and distribution of prey species. Issue 2 : Impacts of climate change and eff ects of diminishing sea ice are unknown. Conservation actions: a) Develop approach for evaluating eff ects of climate change on important habitats for this species group. b) Establish multidisciplinary studies to document habitat change, especially those related to sea ice. Issue 3 : Need better documentation of subsis tence harvest, and refinement of management goals. Conservation actions: a) Document harvest levels. b) Document TEK and incorporate with scientific studies and related management actions. c) Support co-management organizations. d) Investigate need for estab lishing international agreem ents for the management of ice-associated species. e) Develop harvest management protocols, through co-management organizations, to avoid potential overharvest. Issue 4 : Need to better understand the effects of human activities, and initiate appropriate management efforts to sustain ice-associated species. Conservation actions: a) Identify activities with potential for adverse effects. Determine effects of noise on ice-associated species. 629 Appendix 4, Page 408 Assess impact of coastal development, and oil and gas activity in Beaufort and Chukchi seas. Determine effects of pollution, including persistent contaminants and oil spills. b) Develop guidelines to reduce/mitigate adverse effects from human activities, including cumulative effects. c) Implement guidelines through various avenues, such as federal, state, or local permits. d) Identify and conserve nearshore ringed s eal lairs in areas of industrial activity and development (e.g. Beaufort Sea developments) through research, regulation and education. Specifically, c ontinue to require incidental take permits under the Marine Mammal Pr otection Act, follow DNR guidelines and mitigation measures, and obtain permits through NMFS. e) Identify and conserve polar bear dens through research, regulation and education. Specifically, continue to requi re incidental take permits (MMPA), follow DNR guidelines and mitigation m easures, and obtain permits through USFWS. f) Determine and establish methods to m onitor volume of shipping traffic and expansion of fisheries in areas used by ice-associated species. There is potential for increased shipping (related to transport, tourism, military, and research) and fishing, as sea ice extent decreases. g) Also, monitor contaminants in tissues of subsistence harvested animals. H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats NOAA Fisheries USFWS, in cooperation with Alaska Native marine mammal organizations, have the respons ibility for management of th is group of ice-associated marine mammals. Acquisition of sufficient funding and implementation of conservation actions should begin immediately. I. Recommended time frame for reviewing species status and trends Five years or sooner if signifi cant new information is obtained. J. Bibliography Angliss, R.P. and K.L. Lodge. 2004.

Sperm whale - distributed widely th roughout the world's large water masses from both polar regions to the equator; large males observed close to the edge of the pack ice. As males grow older, they shift to higher latitudes, whereas females are typically distributed at la titudes less than 40 degrees (except 50 degrees north in the North Pacific). Sei whale - Distributed in all ocean ba sins, but typically farther from shore and not near polar regions. Blue whale - Distributed in all ocean basins, and Antarctic waters and north to Svalbard and Spitsbergen in the Atlantic. Gray whale - Distribution is much mo re coastal than other large whales, primarily inshore or shallow waters of the continental shelf. Eastern population ranges from ~20 degrees north in Mexico north along the coast of North America to the Chukchi and Beaufort seas, and east along the Kamchatka Peninsula. Western populati on may range from both the east and west side of the Kamchatka Peninsula southwest along Asia to the Gulf of Tonkin.

Distribution and abundance (Angliss and Lodge 2004) Range : Global range comments: Distributed in seasonally ice- covered waters of the Arctic and near-Arctic, with 5 stocks currently recognized by the International Whaling 635 Appendix 4, Page 414 Commission for management purposes: Okhotsk, Davis Strait, Hudson Bay, Spitsbergen, and Western Arctic. State range comments: Western Arctic stock (also known as the Bering stock and Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort stock) is the largest population, and th e only stock found in U.S. waters. The majority of the Wester n Arctic stock migrates annually from wintering areas in the northe rn Bering Sea, through the Chukchi Sea in the spring to the Beaufort Sea, where they spend much of the summer before returning again to the Bering Sea in the fall to overwinter. Abundance : Global abundance comments: The 4 stocks not in U.S. waters are relatively small, only consisting of 10s to 100s of whales. State abundance comments: The 2001 abundance estimate for the Western Arctic stock abundance is 10,470 (CI: 8100-13,500). Trends : Global trends: Most stocks stable State trends: Western Arctic stock is increasi ng about ~3.4% (CI: 1.7%-5%) annually C.

Concerns associated with key habitats (George et al. 2004) See Section C. F. Goal: Maintain Western Arctic bowhead stock within the range of OSP and as significant functioning element of the marine ecosystem. G. Conservation objectives and actions (George et al. 2004) State conservation and management needs : Objective : Maintain or increase the abundance a nd current distribution of the Western Arctic bowhead stock; maintain habitat quality. Target: Level trend in annual abundance as m easured over a 10-year cycle; 100% of habitat currently occupied. Measure: Index of abundance and documenta tion of seasonal distribution of Western Arctic bowheads; baseline map of available habitats to compare with monitoring results. Issue 1 : Lack of research addressing current concerns. Conservation actions : a) Determine importance of summer vs. winter feeding areas b) Determine specific areas of concentr ation (e.g., feeding and wintering) c) Determine if all bowheads migrate from the Bering to Beaufort in summer d) Establish international collaborative rese arch efforts to document distribution and habitat use. e) Evaluate climate change effects on bowh ead whale habitats and determine if the changes are positive or negati ve through multidisciplinary studies. f) Evaluate stock structure of Western Arctic bowheads, including adequate sample sizes (bowhead tissues) from the Bering Sea, including the Chukotka Peninsula, during summer. g) Evaluate rangewide effects (e.g., noise, fishing, shipping, industrial activities) on population status of bowheads. h) Develop and enhance techniques for st udying bowhead whales that are not detrimental to whales or intrusiv e to those who harvest bowheads. Issue 2 : Maintain population monitoring programs. Conservation actions : a) Estimate population size of bowhead s by 2011. (International Whaling Commission requires an estimate of population size every 10 years; the last estimate was from 2001.) b) Continue collecting data on life history traits of bowheads, including a better understanding of foraging needs and aging. 637 Appendix 4, Page 416 Issue 3 : International distri bution and management. Conservation actions : a) Harvest is currently managed throu gh cooperative agreement between the NMFS/NOAA and Alaska Eskimo Wha ling Commission, as well as through the International Whaling Commission. Harvest co-management should continue through the most appropriate means possible. b) Continue to manage the harvest of Western Arctic bowheads through international collaboration with the indigenous peoples and governments of Russia and Canada. Issue 4 : Potential mortality and serious injury of bowhead whales incidental to the Bering Sea crab fishery. Conservation actions : a) Evaluate impacts from Bering S ea crab fishery on bowheads. b) Reduce impacts from Bering Sea crab fish ery by designing gear that will least likely entangle bowheads. c) Monitor frequency of scarring on bowhead s from fishing gear through aerial surveys and examination of harvested whales. d) Ensure that all gear is retrieved. Issue 5 : Potential impacts from oil and gas exploration and development in the Beaufort (United States and Canadian) and Chukchi seas on bowhead whale feeding, movement patterns, and migration. Conservation actions : a) Manage offshore explorations and deve lopment to conserve bowhead whales. b) Further identify and measure the extent of effects fr om oil and gas activities that adversely effect bowheads. c) Further develop guidelines to eliminate/reduce/mitigate adverse effects from development. d) Continue to provide guidelin es through various avenues, such as federal, state, or local permits or Conflict Avoidance Agreements. e) In addition to current drilling rest rictions during migration, consider establishing acoustic thres holds for the Beaufort Sea to reduce potential for harassment or injury to bowhead whales. f) Identify important foraging areas for bowheads and implement measures to protect these areas from industrial activities. g) Continue monitoring effects from ex isting oil and gas activities in the Beaufort Sea. 638 Appendix 4, Page 417 H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats NOAA Fisheries, in cooperation with th e Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission, the International Whaling Commission, and the North Slope Borough have the responsibility for the recovery of the western arctic bow head whale stock.

Species Common name : humpback whale Scientific name: Megapetera novaeanglia B. Distribution and abundance (Angliss and Lodge 2004) Range : Global range comments: circumpolar, less common in Arctic waters State range comments: Alaska is a migratory feeding destination for 2 and possibly 3 stocks of humpback whales in the North Pa cific. The western stock winters in the waters of Japan and the Philippines and is known to migrate to Alaskan waters for feeding. This stock is known historically to migrate to the western Aleutian Islands, southern Bering Sea, and po ssibly the southern Chukchi Sea. Current data for the western stock has shown connections to northern British Columbia, the Kodiak Archipelago and the Shumagin Islands. The central stock is known to migrate to Southeast Alaska, British Columbia, Prince William Sound, Kodi ak Island and the 639 Appendix 4, Page 418 Shumagin Islands. Humpback whales that winter in Mexico 's offshore waters (Revillagigedo Archipelago) ar e not yet connected to any one feeding area, but some of them have been documented in Alaskan waters. Abundance : Global abundance comments: Unknown State abundance comments: North Pacific population is estimated at about 10,000 (Calambokidis et al. in prep). The portion of the population that exists in Alaskan waters is unknown but is less than 10,000 because some of the population feeds in waters off the continental U.S. and Canadian coasts. Trends : Global trends: Mst populations are likely recove ring from commercial exploitation State trends: Central stock increasing at 7% /year (Mobley et al. 2001), unknown trends for western stock. C. Problems, issues, or concerns for species (IUCN/SSC Cetacean Specialist Group 2003; Mobley et al. 2001) Vessel disturbance/whale watching: Whale watching and vessel traffic have been increasing in most of the areas used by humpback whales. This has reached high levels in some feeding areas, such as Southeast Alaska. A dditionally, this is an emerging industry in Canada and along th e U.S. West Coast. These activities have the potential to disrupt feedi ng and displace mothers and calves. Entanglement: Humpback whales are subject to entanglement in fishing gear, in particular, gillnets and pot gear. The seve rity of the problem varies regionally, with the highest number of reported cases in Southeast Alaska. The number of entanglements is underreported for all re gions, and there are indications the entanglement rate is in creasing in some areas. Ship strikes : Ship strikes are a threat to larg e whales worldwide. As levels of commerce and tourism increase in North Am erica, the likelihood of vessel strikes to whales also increases. A 2003 NMFS report compiled nearly 300 records of ship strikes worldwide since 1975, and humpbacks were one of the most commonly hit species. The only specific m easures at present to reduce the threat of ship strikes for humpbacks are vessel re strictions in Glacier Bay National Park, Alaska. In Southeast Alaska, strikes of humpbacks by cruise ships appear to be increasing, and potential con cerns for high-speed ferries that have recently begun operating need to be evaluated. Noise/acoustic injury and disturbance : Impacts from ocean noise are a serious threat to humpback whales because they produce and use low-frequency sounds, as do other whales. Noise can result in direct physiological trauma through temporary or permanent threshold shifts in hearing, or in avoidance behavior that in turn may force animals away from critical feeding, br eeding, or migratory areas. Noise also may cause humpbacks to suspend important social activities, including feeding, mating, and nursing, or mask communication necessary for survival. The variety of low-frequency anthropogenic sound sources in the ocean includes Navy activities (L ow-frequency Active mid-ra nge sonar), oceanographic 640 Appendix 4, Page 419 experiments (like Acoustic Thermometry of Ocean Climate), vessel traffic, and seismic air-gun surveys. Oil explorati on and associated seismic surveys are ongoing and proposed in Alaska. It is not clear where sound sources are concentrated; however, a substantial amount of noise exists in the North Pacific Ocean that may threaten humpback whale populations. Impacts on habitat and prey: Although changes in habitat and prey could result in substantial impacts to humpback whales, the data to fully evaluate this issue are not available. Direct competition for food resources may exist, particularly for herring, both a humpback whale prey item and a targeted commercial fishery. Little is known about krill and other fo rage fish in humpback feeding areas, especially Alaska. Logging near humpback wh ale marine habitats may affect their prey base. Climate change and regime shifts triggered by human-induced activities have the potential to impact the survival of whale populations. Contaminants/pollution : Contaminant impacts are a significant concern for many species of marine mammals that concentrate toxins in their blubber, particularly as more and more chemical compounds end up in the world's oceans. Levels of chemical compounds found in North Pacific populations of killer whales are among the highest documented in any animal worldwide. Stable contaminants, such as PCBs and pesticides, are generally far lower in baleen whales, such as humpbacks, because they feed lower on the food chain, and therefore are less of a problem. D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas Nearshore coastal area is primary habita t for feeding humpback whales in Alaskan waters. E. Identify threats or concerns associated with key habitats (IUCN/SSC Cetacean Specialist Group 2003; Mobley et al. 2001) See Section C. F. Goal: Maintain the population within the rang e of OSP and as significant functioning element of the marine ecosystem G. Conservation objectives and actions (IUCN/SSC Cetacean Specialist Group 2003; Mobley et al. 2001) State conservation and management needs : Objective : Increase the abundance of western and central stocks of humpback whales. Target: Increase the current level of abundan ce, and maintain or increase habitat quality. Measure: Estimate of abundance and documen tation of seasonal distribution. Issue 1 : Lack of information on populati on status, trends, and structure. Conservation actions : a) Initiate new efforts, as well as increase existing efforts, to gather current information on abundance, distri bution, and population structure. 641 Appendix 4, Page 420 b) Work to reestablish U.S. funding for a program similar to the Large Whale Initiative. c) Identify funding to complete portions of SPLASH Project (Structure of Population, Levels of Abundance and St atus of Humpback Whales), which provide information on abundance and distribution. d) Work with the governments of Canada and Mexico to identify funding for all or a portion of the costs of the sampling within their countries. Issue 2 : Develop management options for addressing impacts of human activities on mortality rates and populations. Conservation actions : a) Conduct additional coordinated research efforts on the impact of whale- watching vessels; collaboration among countries would be ideal. There are anecdotal reports of shifts in displace ment of mothers and calves from some areas with heavy vessel activities, yet this concern needs to be documented. b) Identify additional funding for enforcement of existing whale-watching regulations. Often, even a few enforcem ent actions are enough to change the behavior of vessel operators. c) Identify the principal regions and time periods posing the greatest risk of collision between ships and humpback whales. d) Encourage voluntary cooperation from the cruise ship and other industries operating large high-speed vessels to reduce speed in these areas during critical time periods. e) Encourage legislation to impose these restrictions if it is not occurring voluntarily. f) Encourage sharing of information and collaboration among countries about sources and impacts of anthropogenic sounds. g) Encourage minimization of project s involving production of loud, low- frequency, anthropogenic sounds in ar eas and times of critical humpback whale use. h) Facilitate information sharing between agencies and nations about the extent, nature, and source of entanglement even ts in order to better understand the problem. In addition, promote information sharing on the development and efficacy of gear modifications in order to optimize mitigation efforts. i) Increase understanding of this issue to the Ministerial level in Mexico, where the problem has been increasing. j) Increase the effectiveness of disentan glement efforts. Whereas training and equipment has been put into place in a number of areas in the United States and Canada, problems with reporting and implementation have prevented effective action and successful outcomes. H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats NOAA Fisheries has the responsibility for management and recovery of humpback whales. Acquisition of sufficient funding a nd implementation of conservation actions should begin immediately. 642 Appendix 4, Page 421 I.

Species group description Common names : beaked whales: Baird's beaked Lodge 2004; IUCN/SSC Cetacean pecialist Group 2003) S Range : Global range comments: Currently 20 recognized species in 5 genera; all species are pelagic and live and feed in the open oceans. Very little is known about most species; Cuvier's is thought to perhaps be the most widely distributed beaked whale State range comments: Baird's and Stejneger's beaked whales occur in the North Pacific Ocean and Western Bering Sea, whereas Cuvier's beaked whale occurs in the North Pacific Ocean Abundance : Global abundance comments: Unknown State abundance comments: Unknown Trends : Global trends: Unknown State trends: Unknown 643 Appendix 4, Page 422 C. Problems, issues, or concerns for species group (IUCN/SSC Cetacean Specialist Group 2003) Lack of information on geographic range, distribution, abundance, life history parameters, population structure and trends , foraging behavior, essential habitat needs. Potential impacts of climate change on pr ey availability, distribution, and biomass. Possible fishery interactions - at least 6 different co mmercial fisheries operate within the range of this species group , and incidental mortality has been documented outside of Alaska. Although no in cidental mortality or serious injury has been reported in Alaska, observer cove rage is limited, and thus some risk of interaction remains. Noise - including naval military operations, shipping and fishing traffic, seismic surveys, and coastal development. Mass strandings have occurred in the north Atlantic associated with naval activitie s, including the live stranding of 14 individual beaked whales (Cuvier's, Blanville's, and unidentified species) in the Bahamas in March 2000. Necropsies of 6 of these whales found tissue damage from acoustic or impulse injury that li kely caused the whales to strand, with mortality resulting from physiologic stress associated with the physical stranding. Similar mortalities have been docum ented in Mexico. There are no known strandings in Alaskan waters. D. Location and condition of key or important habitat areas The available data do not allow assessment of current habitat n eeds, though beaked whales are thought to feed in deep pelagic waters for fish and squid . E. Concerns associated with key habitats Unknown. F. Goal: Maintain beaked whale populations within the range of OSP, and as significant functioning element of the marine ecosystem. G. Conservation objectives and actions (IUCN/SSC Cetacean Specialist Group 2003) Objective : Maintain sustainable and well-di stributed Beaked whale populations. (Reassess objective as new survey information on abundance becomes available.) Target: Level trend in annual abundance of each sampled species as measured over a 10-year cycle. Measure: Trend analysis based on information from baseline surveys. Species and habitat distribution maps acquired through acoustics and shipboard surveys (include genetic sampling and satellite tagging). Issue 1 : Information on this species group is severely limited and fundamentally precludes development of a conservation strategy. 644 Appendix 4, Page 423 Conservation actions: a) Develop reliable population estimates, and collect data on population structure, abundance, and trends. b) Collect data on geographi c distribution and movements and life history parameters. c) Acquire information necessary to iden tify and protect essential habitat. d) Develop monitoring protocols. e) Conduct necropsies on dead beaked whales. f) Include opportunistic sighting effort s for beaked whales during marine research conducted by federal and st ate agencies whenever possible. g) Educate mariners to report sightings a nd provide verifiable documentation of beaked whales across the North Pacific. h) Coordinate research effort s internationally with Ca nada, Russia, and Japan. Issue 2: The potential effects of noise on beaked whales need evaluation. Conservation actions: a) Coordinate management efforts with Canada, particularly with sonar and seismic activities. b) Educate mariners to report strandings. c) If strandings occur, monitor military a nd commercial operations that include sonar for potential lethal impacts on beaked whales. H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats NOAA Fisheries should review beaked wh ale monitoring studies conducted off the western United States and Mexico and initiate similar studies in Al aska, if applicable, within 5 years.

Distribution and abundance Range : Global range comments: E. japonica exists in the North Pacific, E. glacialis exists in the North Atlantic, and E. australis exists in the Southern Hemisphere. State range comments: Historically, right whales we re distributed throughout the western Pacific, Gulf of Alaska, and southeastern Bering Sea. Current known distribution is limited to a few animals on the Bering Sea shelf and an occasional sighting elsewhere in the North Pacific (NMFS 1991). Abundance: Global abundance comments: Potentially, before commerc ial exploitation, in excess of 11,000 whales existed historically in the North Pacific (Angliss and Lodge 2004). There are possibly 2 populations of right whales in the North Pacific; western and eastern. Survey data indicate the abundan ce of right whales in the western North Pacific is 900 (CI 404-2108) (NMFS 1991), and the abundance of the eastern population is very low, in the tens of animals. State abundance comments: Until recently, the easter n North Pacific population existed in Alaska waters with abundance in the tens of animals. In September 2004, biologists following the satelli te signal from a whale tagged in August, photographed 25 whales in the Bering Sea about 50 mile s due north of Dutch Harbor, including 3 cows accompanied by calves. This doubled th e number of the critically endangered whales known to forage near Alaska. Trends: Global trends : Unknown State trends : Unknown C.

Concerns associated with key habitats (IUCN/SSC Cetacean Specialist Group 2003) Habitat changes associated with clim ate change, contaminants, or pollution. Future oil and gas leasing has the potential to degrade habitat in the historical range of right whales (NMFS 1991). F. Goal: Maintain the population within the rang e of OSP and as significant functioning element of the marine ecosystem. G. Conservation objectives and actions (IUCN/SSC Cetacean Specialist Group 2003) State conservation and management needs : Objective : Promote the recovery of North Pacific right whales to a population level that would prevent extinction within the next century. Target: Allow for maximum growth of popul ation; theoretical maximum for cetaceans is 4%/year. Measure: Monitor changes in abundance and distribution though acoustic, aerial, and shipboard surveys (include photographic and genetic sampling and satellite tagging). Issue 1 : Current abundance is extremely low, and near level of functional extinction. Conservation actions : a) Acquire information necessary to identif y and protect criti cal habitat (conduct studies in areas of hi storical presence). b) Collect data on population st ructure, life hi story parameters, abundance, and trends. c) Collect data on geographic di stribution and movements. d) Collect photographs for individual identification and frequency of entanglements and ship strikes. e) Conduct oceanographic surveys to collect data on likely prey species and associated variability with climate change. f) Compile information from all historical whaling records. g) Coordinate research effort s with Canada and Russia. h) Conduct research on feeding ecology. i) Conduct necropsies on any dead right whale. j) Educate mariners to report sightings and verifiable documentation of right whales across the North Pacific. 647 Appendix 4, Page 426 Issue 2 : If population is determined to be rec overable, management efforts need to be initiated . Conservation actions : a) Coordinate management efforts with Canada. b) Maintain ban on hunting and directed takes. c) Increase awareness at federal, state a nd private level to secure funding for all conservation actions. d) Consider relevant mitigation measures for noise, contaminants/pollution, and vessel and fishery interactions. e) Educate mariners of the vulnerability of right whales to ship strikes. H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats NOAA Fisheries has the responsibility for ma nagement and recovery of North Pacific right whales. Acquisition of sufficient funding and implementation of conservation actions should begin immediately. Draft recove ry plan needs to be finalized as soon as possible. I.

H. Plan and time frames for monitoring species and their habitats USFWS has the lead responsibility for manage ment of sea otters and is required to annually review and revise stock assessment reports as necessary. The USFWS continuously monitors subsistence harvest of sea otters through the marine mammal marking, tagging, and reporting program. In recent years, population monitoring has been a shared activity between USFWS, US GS, and the Alaska S ea Otter and Steller Sea Lion Commission, with USFWS and USGS conducting large-scale aerial surveys, and all 3 entities conducting skiff-based su rveys at index sites throughout the state.

Key Habitats of Featured Species Appendix 5.1 Forest Habitats Featured Species-Associ ated Forest Habitats: Boreal Forest and Coastal Temperate Forest There are approximately 120 million acres of forestland (land with > 10% tree cover) in Alaska (Hutchison 1968). That area can be further classified depending on wh ere it occurs in the state. The vast majority of forestland, about 107 millio n acres, occurs in Interior Alaska and is classified as \"boreal forest.\" About 13 million acres of forest occurs along Alaska's southern coast, including the Kodiak Archipelago, Prince William Sound, and the islands and mainland of Southeast Alaska. This is classified as coasta l temperate rain forest. The Cook Inlet region is considered to be a transition zone between the Interior boreal forest and the coastal temperate forest. For a map showing Alaska 's land status and forest ty pes, see Figure 5.1 on page 2. Boreal Forest The boreal zone is a broad northern circumpolar belt that spans up to 10\u00b0 of latitude in North America. The boreal forest of North America stre tches from Alaska to the Rocky Mountains and eastward to the Atlantic Ocean and occupies approximately 28 % of the continental land area north of Mexico and more than 60 % of the total area of the forests of Canada and Alaska (Johnson et al. 1995). Across its range, coniferous trees make up the primary component of the boreal forest. Dominant tree species vary regionally depending on local soil conditions and variations in microclimate. Broadleaved trees, such as aspen and poplar, occur in pure stands or mixed with conifers. \"Boreal forest\" and \"t aiga\" are often used interchang eably to refer to the plant communities in this region. Taiga is a Russian wo rd originally applied to the broad ecotone between sub-Arctic forest and tund ra in Eurasia. Its use has been expanded to include sub-Arctic forests in Eurasia and North America. Boreal forest, Nabesna D. Ryland, ADF&G In Alaska, the boreal biome stretches from the Ke nai Peninsula to the south slope of the Brooks Range (Viereck and Little 1972). A transition zone exists south of the Alaska Range in the region surrounding Cook Inlet and stretching northwar d into the Susitna River Valley. 653Gulf of Alaska BayKuskokwim erKu 9 0 1 2 0 MilesLegend Land Status Private State ForestsAlaska's Land Status and Forests Federal BorealCoastal Temperate Rainforests St at e o f A la sk a De part men t o f F is h a nd Ga me Ju ly 2005Sources: Land Status, DNR's Ecoregions, Survey Open-File Report 02-297(map). Appendix 5.1. Alaska's land status and forest types.Appendix 5.1, Page 2 654 Appendix 5.1, Page 3 Uplands1 Needleleaf, broadleaf, and mixed forest communiti es occur across a variety of sites in the boreal zone. Communities composed of tall scrub typically exist in areas of expo sed alluvial soil, such as floodplains, streambanks, and lake margins, on burned or otherwise dist urbed areas, and near timberline. Low scrub communities develop in mo ist areas and on slopes with northern aspects. The wettest sites support a mixture of tall scr ub swamps, low scrub bogs , or scrub/graminoid communities. in the boreal ecoregion are dominated by spru ce and occur over a variety of site conditions. White spruce ( Picea glauca [Moench] Voss) occurs on warm, dry, slopes on well-drained sites along rivers where pe rmafrost is absent, and at timberline where drainage is good. Dominant understory components in white spruce stands include shrubs such as resin birch ( Picea Mariana [Mill.] B.S.P.) forests are found on floodplain terraces and flat to rolling uplands on well-drained soils. Tamarack ( Larix laricinia [Du Roi] K. E.F. Binnian, Alaska. USGS Professional Paper 1567. U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC. 73 p. Viereck, L.A., C.T. Dyrness, A.R. Batten, and K.J. Wenzlick. Classification. USFS General Technical Report PNW-GTR-286. Portland , OR. 278 p. 655 Appendix 5.1, Page 4 Koch) may be associated with black spruce in wet bottomland areas. Low shrubs typically associated with black spruce include Labrador-tea ( Ledum spp.), prickly rose, resin birch. The ground is usually cove red with a continuous balsam poplar, quaking aspen, or a mix of the 2 develop on floodplains of meandering rivers. These forest types often follow the establishment of alder and willow thickets and may be subsequently replaced by stands of white spruce. Understory shrubs associated with broadleaf forests include alder, willow, and prickly rose. Herbaceous species typically found dominated by different of spru ce, birch, and aspen. grass, bearberry, and Labrador-tea. Interior highlands consisting of rounded low mountains primarily sustain dwarf scrub vegetation and open spruce stands, with graminoid- herbaceous communities occurring in poorly drained areas. Open coniferous forests and woodlands typically dominated by white spruce with black spruce, birch, and aspen codominants are often found above 500 m up to timberline. These forest types contain an open shrub layer consisting of resin birch, alder, willow, prickly rose, buffaloberry, and other ericaceous shrubs. Ground cover generally consists of a layer of mosses and lichen similar to those found in conjunction with black spruce. Boreal forest, Susitna Basin D. Ryland, ADF&G Interior bottomlands associated with the larger rivers in the Interior are typified by poorly drained, shallow soils, often over permafrost. Bo ttomland coniferous forests are dominated by white spruce, black spruce, or a combination of the two. Closed stands of white spruce occupy terrace locations with well-draine d soils. Understory vegetation consists primarily of low and dwarf scrub such as Vaccinium spp. and dwarf birch often accompanied by twinflower and horsetail. A well-developed layer of feathermoss is also common. Closed stands of black spruce occur on floodplains often associated with white spruce and paper birch on well-drained sites. Understory vegetation is composed of al der, prickly rose, willow, Labrador-tea, Vaccinium spp., and a moss layer including Hylocomium spp. and Pleurozium spp. Colder, wetter sites are occupied by black spruce woodlands with a tall shrub understory c onsisting of alder, willow, and resin birch. On these sites, the ta ll shrub understory is a more im portant component of the habitat 656 Appendix 5.1, Page 5 than in closed stands. Ericaceous Vaccinium spp., of closed stands dominated by balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera L.) or quaking aspen with G. Don) is typical. Mixed forests are predominantly made up of paper birc h with spruce cohorts or white spruce with balsam poplar. Understory species are generally the same as those found with broadleaf or white spruce-dominated stands. Cook Inlet: A Transition Zone The area around Cook Inlet is a transition zone betw een the coastal rain fo rest and the Interior boreal region. This ecoregion has the mildest clim ate in the boreal region of Alaska and is generally free from permafrost. Tall scrub co mmunities dominated by alder and willow, either alone or in combination, form thickets on streambanks, floodplai ns, and drainage ways. Mesic graminoid herbaceous and low scrub graminoid communities occur across a range of moist to dry sites. Dry to mesic sites may be dominated by a and ericace ous shrubs. Coniferous, deciduous, and mixed forest stands are common. Needleleaf forests include white, black, and Sitka spruce depending on soil conditions and microclimate. Deciduous forests domin ated by quaking aspen, paper birch, balsam poplar, and black cottonwood. Mixed forest types may contain codominant cohorts that include spruce in combination with any of these broadleaf species. White spruce forests are typically found on well-dr ained sites. Black spruce, paper birch, balsam poplar, and aspen are common codominant co mponents with white spruce. Low shrubs associated with white spruce rose. Herbaceous cover varies depending on canopy density and local moisture regime. Horsetail, twinflower, and bluejoint grass are all commonly found in conjunction with white spruce. Mosses, such as Hylocomium spp. and Pleurozium spp., often form a continuous layer under dense canopies. Quaking aspen can form almost pure stands on relatively warm, well-drained, upland soils. Stands often contain balsam poplar, spruce, and paper birch cohorts. Asso ciated shrubs prickly rose, buffaloberry, and hi ghbush cranberry. Herbaceous cover is generally sparse under closed stands but may include scattered bluejoint grass, are scarce . Open stands of quaking aspen tend to have a denser herbaceous understory. Paper birch generally occupy dry to moist sites in the Cook Inlet region. Open stands of paper birch on drier, warmer sites may include white spruce, while wetter sites may include a black spruce component; however, spruce are not usua lly abundant in closed paper birch stands. Understory components include alde r, prickly rose, and highbush cranberry. Stands that are more 657 Appendix 5.1, Page 6 open may include resin birch. The herb layer is usually dominated by bluejoint grass; however, horsetail and bluebell are comm on understory components. Black spruce tends to be dominant on poorly dr ained sites and may include a paper birch cohort. Alder is the most common tall shrub associated with black spruce. Low shrubs include prickly rose, willow, Labrador-tea, twinflower, and Vaccinium spp. Feathermosses are common, along with Sphagnum spp., on wetter sites. Open black spruce forests or stands may include bush cinquefoil ( Potentilla fruticosa L.), crowberry, and resin birc h along with willow, alder, and herbs, such as horsetail and bluejoint grass. Ecological Role of Boreal Forest Habitats Forest ecosystems support relatively high levels of biodiversity because they have many vertically differentiated niches, and because they have large accumulations of biomass that can support a diverse food web. Forests with high stru ctural and/or vegetative diversity will also include horizontally differentiated niches, such as edges between forest communities and meadows, or where different vegetative conditi ons meet within a plan t community. The boreal forest region is a large and diverse patchwor k of distinctive ecosyst ems and flora in which complex interrelationships between climate, sola r radiation, surface water, slope, aspect, soil characteristics, permafrost, and disturbance regimes create patterns of vegetation across the landscape. As a result, the boreal forest includes a range of habitat types that vary from closed forest to open shrub and herbaceous communitie s that inhabit both uplands and wetlands. Birds represent the largest class of vertebrates in the boreal forest. Over 80 % of all terrestrial vertebrates associated with the western boreal region of Canada ar e birds (Niemi et al. 1998). Of the various species that rely on the boreal fore st, approximately 20 % are permanent residents; the remainder are migrants that spend the summ er breeding season in th e boreal forest (Smith 1993. Birds play a fundamental ecol ogical role in the forest, and data supporting the importance of birds in maintaining healthy forested ecosystems is increasing. During summer, most forest birds eat insects, particularly moth larvae. Re search indicates that birds can reduce insect densities (Holmes et al. 1979; Atlegrim 1989), es pecially when the insect populations are at either low or endemic levels (Crawford and Jennings 1989; Holmes 1990; Torgerson et al. 1990). For birds in the boreal region, there appears to be a close relationship between habitat diversity and species diversity (Kessel 1998 ). Some deciduous forest types in the boreal region have a great potential for providing multiple habitat niches. Cottonwood forests in the upper Susitna River basin were found to support high numbers of breeding species of bor eal forest birds and the greatest density of breeding territories comp ared to other boreal fore st types in the area. Kessel (1998) hypothesized the high occupancy and species richness found in the cottonwood forests was due to the high productivity of the floodplain ecosystems where these forests were found and the structural diversity within the fore st that created many ve rtical habitat niches. While boreal spruce forests tend to have lower bird densities and species richness than deciduous forests, they provide more stable habitat for resident species, su ch as Boreal Chickadees, White- winged Crossbills, and Great Horned Owls. The gr eatest densities of permanent residents occur in forests dominated by white spruce (Kessel 1998). 658 Appendix 5.1, Page 7 In the boreal forest, harvest of floodplain white spruce has the potential to reduce age-class diversity at the landscape level. Forest on floodpl ains and islands have a lower probability of experiencing stand-replacement fire, and therefor e, grow considerably older and more complex than forest stands that experi ence frequent fires. These stands support a large proportion of the boreal forest's species diversity, particularly invertebrates and nonvascular plants. Kessel (1998) concluded that most bird species ar e relatively specific with regard to aspects of their structural habitat requireme nts across their geographic ranges and that much of the habitat variation previously reported in North America is the result of considering only macrohabitats or measuring factors only indirectly related to a species' ecology. Many boreal forest birds use macrohabitat across forest types while occupying specific habitat niches. For example, across most of Alaska, Gray-Cheeked Thrush, Fox Sparrow, and White-Crowned Sparrow occupy shrub habitats. However, where specific shrub habitat features occur within a forest, these species will nest under the canopy and superficially appear to be bi rds of forest habitat (Kessel 1998). Even small patches of different habitat wi thin uniform stands can be enough to account for the occurrence of a particular species. For exampl e, in their analysis of habitat associations of breeding birds of boreal forest in Alaska, W illson and Comet (1996) noted that 1-2 spruce trees in a deciduous stand was enough for Ruby-Crowned Ki nglet or Hermit Thrush to hold a territory, and that these species would forage in the surrounding d eciduous vegetation. Many forest bird species, such as flycatchers, thrushes, and wood warblers, use boreal forests for breeding and rearing young, but wint er as far away as Central or South America. Such birds require boreal forest habitats for survival. Many of the long-distance migrants are particularly sensitive to fragmentation of breeding habitat (Smith 1993), and Alaska's boreal forest is an important part of the breeding range of several species of borea l forest landbirds known to be declining in other por tions of their North American range. Boreal Forest Conservation Status Overall, Alaska's forest habitats are generally healthy. However, localized development will likely continue to result in subs tantial habitat alteration. Opportunities should be sought that alleviate negative impacts, and maintain connect ivity and suitable areas of quality habitat important to the sustainability of species . Approximately 37% of the total area in Alaska's boreal forest region lies w ithin state or federal conservation units, including fede ral and state wildlife refuges, parks, national monuments, and other designations. These areas were designated by the state and federal governments to preserve unique or fragile ecosystems and hist oric sites and to protect essent ial fish and wildlife habitat. The remaining lands consist of other state la nds, municipal or borough lands, Native allotment and corporation lands, and other private holdings. Management goals and objectives for the conser vation units reflect the importance of each area with regard to conserving essential fish and wild life habitats, and as such, there are usually some restrictions on development within these areas. Generally, the laws and regulations, management plans, goals, and objectives written to guide th e management of these areas recognize their importance as essential fish and wildlife habitat, along with the protection of important cultural 659 Appendix 5.1, Page 8 and historic sites. As a result, development activi ties on some lands are often restricted or closely controlled to prevent changi ng the natural character of the lands and waters. Literature Cited Atlegrim, O. 1989.

These areas experience a maritime climate, with cool summers, warm winters, and abundant precipitation distributed throughout the year. As trees in this forest age and become decadent, they either die in place or are toppled by wind, creating a small gap in the overhead canopy. This break in the canopy allows light to reach the forest floor, promoting the growth of new trees and understory vegetation. Over time, this high- frequency, low-intensity disturban ce results in a forest with many ages of trees and many small gaps intermingled on a fine spatial scale. Such fo rests are called \"old growth.\" Essential features of old growth include a multilayered canopy, the presence of large (for the site ), old trees, a well- developed understory, and dead and down trees on the forest floor. The vast majority of Alaska's coastal temperate rain forests are in an old-growth condition. Young, primary forests develop on lands newly exposed by landslides, receding glaciers, or beach uplift. When old-growth forests are felle d, either by clearcutting or by catastrophic winds, secondary succession also creates a new, young fore st. Whether the young, developing forest is the result of primary or secondary succession, th e 2 are similar structurally and functionally. These young forests are characterized by uniform tree ages less than 150 years old, a single- layered canopy, and a relatively depauperate understory. It takes 200-300 years for young- growth stands to develop the compositional and structural characteristics of old growth. Coastal Temperate Rain Forest Types Alaska's old-growth rain forest can be further subdivided into different forest \"types,\" or habitats, based on the dominant tree species and on forest productivity. The dominant tree species and major types are described below. Species\u2014 The cooler temperatures, low sun angles, and short summer growing season in higher-latitude forests favor dominance by conifers. In coastal Alaska, the most abundant tree species is western hemlock ( 10 spp.) and cottonwood ( Populus balsamifera), are least common, being found mostly on avalanche slopes, active riparian zones, and ma inland river drainages in Southeast Alaska. Western hemlock is ubiquitous throughout the Alexander Archipelago and predominates on well-drained, organic soils. There, individual trees may be > 6 ft in diameter and > 500 years old. At higher elevations, higher latitudes, and cold er temperatures, wester n hemlock is replaced by the closely related mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana ). Both species gradually fade out as one moves north and west through the coastal te mperate rain forest ecosystem, where Sitka spruce becomes more dominant. Sitka spruce occurs th roughout the coastal temperate rain forest. On Kodiak and Afognak islands, the forests are nearly pure Sitka spruce stands. In Southeast Alaska, Sitka spruce occur most often in mixed stands with hemlock and cedar, but do occur in pure stands on some active alluvial and colluvial soils, incl uding riparian areas, avalanche slopes, and uplifted beach zones. Sitka spruce are less shade tolerant than other sp ecies, and they dispropor tionately colonize new openings following wind-throw, or clearcutting. In Alaska, the largest Sitka spruce trees can exceed 225 ft in height and 12 ft in diameter. Western red cedar and Alaska ye llow cedar represent a small bu t important component of the coastal temperate rain forest in Southeast Alaska. Yellow cedar occurs throughout the Alexander Archipelago and Prince William Sound. Western red cedar is restricted to the southern half of the Alexander Archipelago. Both species are most abundant on poorly drained, acidic soils, where they are able to outcompete hemlock and spru ce. Natural resistance to decay by both cedar species results in an abundance of dead-standing snags in the fo rest, but rot-re sistant heartwood means relatively few cavities for nesting, roosting , and foraging. Both sp ecies are economically valuable and have been disproportionately target ed for logging in recent years. In addition, stands of Alaska yellow cedar have been experi encing a significant natural decline since the late 1800s. Whether this is a function of climate change or some bi otic factor is currently unknown. Major habitat types in the coastal temperate rain forest are defined in terms of their relative mix of species. The species mix, in turn, is a function of soil type and drainage, elevation, and latitude. For the coastal temperate rain forests of Alaska, the major forest types include: western hemlock (46% of area), 662 Appendix 5.1, Page 11 Productivity\u2014 There is a second dimension, or criteria, against which forests in Alaska can be classified. Forest \"productivity\" refers to the ra te of tree growth and is reflected in the overall size and biomass of trees on a give n site. Highly productive forests are different structurally than unproductive forests, and they tend to occur in different landscape positions than unproductive forests. For example, we might find a stand of large hemlock trees growing on the toe-slope of a hillside at low elevation and a sparse stand of small hemlocks growing on a wind-battered ridge at high elevation. Both stands would have th e same species composition, but they would look, and function, very differently in terms of wildlife habitat value. The productivity of the forest also has obvious importance from the timber indus try's standpoint, with more productive stands being much more profitable to log. As a result, forest inventories of ten include a breakdown by forest productivity, or size class. At the coarsest level, the forest can be cl assified as \"commercial\" or \"noncommercial,\" depending on whether the forest meets certain re quirements for timber extraction. It reflects an economic, not ecological, judgment, but it suffices as a coarse-scale separation of forest types based on size and structure, and so has value as a descriptor of habitat conditions. All of Alaska's forestland has been classified in those terms, and we adopt them in this plan. Beyond this coarse scale breakdown, the commercial (or productive) forestland can be further defined in terms of tree size (e.g., mean tree di ameter or height) and stand biomass (e.g., wood volume per acre). These descriptors are more difficult to discern from remote sensing (i.e., from aerial photographs), involve more subjectivity, and thus, have more error. Although these distinctions are important from a wildlife standpoint, they are probably more detailed than we need consider for the purpose of this plan. It is important, nonetheless, to recognize a general pattern within productive forestland across Alaska, and particularly within the coastal forest type: The forest acreage at the lower end of the produc tivity scale vastly ou tweighs the forest acreage at the highly productive end. In other words, the bigger the trees in a stand are, the rarer the stand is. Not surprisingly, the more pr oductive stands in the forest have been disproportionately logged in the past and wildlife biologists have identified this \"high-grading\" as a long-term conservation concern (Schoe n et al 1988; Kiester and Eckhardt 1994). Within the coastal temperate rain forest, most of the forested land is noncommercial, or \"unproductive.\" Approximately 5.9 million acres, or 45%, is classified as commercial forestland. Of that commercial forestland, the vast majority ( 85%) exists in Southeast Alaska (i.e., south of Yakutat). The balance exists in Prince William Sound and Afognak Island. The vast majority of forestland in coastal Alaska falls within one of two national fore sts: The Tongass National Forest in Southeast Alaska, and the Chugach National Forest in Southcentral Alaska. These are, by far, the two largest forests in the National Forest system. Coastal Forest-Associated Species Marbled Goshawk, A. g. laingi Northern Goshawk, A. oeconomus sitkensis Ecological Role of Coastal Temperate Rain Forest Habitats Coastal temperate rain forests are characterized by cool summer s, mild winters, and abundant precipitation distributed throughout the year (Alaback 1991). The absence of a dry season makes wildfire extremely rare, so individual trees can live to very old age. Many trees are > 300 years old, while the oldest trees may be > 1000 years old. Trees can live to extremely old age (800 years or more) before succumbing to disease or rot. The primary agent of disturbance in this forest is wind, which typically topples 1-3 trees at a time, crea ting a constantly shifting fine- grained mosaic of small openings within the fo rest (Lertzman et al. 1996; Ott 1997). This gap- phase dynamic produces, over time, a forest with trees of many ages, a multilayered canopy, a diverse, lush understory, and an abundance of dead trees either standing (snags) or lying on the ground in various stages of decay (Capp et al. 199 2). These structural and compositional features make old growth valuable as habitat for many wildlife species. The wind-dominated disturbance regime produces a structurally divers e and highly productive forest. Where it occurs in the Pacific Northwest, this forest type produces more living plant biomass than any other terrestrial ecosystem, in cluding tropical rain forests (Waring and Franklin 1979). Its structural complexity provides niches for diverse animals, including at least 53 species of mammals, 231 birds, and 5 species of amphibi ans and reptiles (Taylor 1979; MacDonald and Cook 1996a, 1996b). For the coastal rain forest ha bitat type, the Strate gy primarily highlights 664 Appendix 5.1, Page 13 nongame species, subspecies, and endemics that are associated with i t; these species were selected because of conservation concerns, economi c importance, or as indicator species for the health of this biome. Marbled Murrelet Following is an illustration of the ecological role of coastal temperate rain fo rests for one species, the Marbled Murrelet (Brachyramphius marmoratus ); the health of its Alaska population is closely tied to health of this particular biome and the adjoining marine environment. The Marbled Murrelet is a small seabird that ranges along the northwestern coas tline of North America, from central California to Al aska's Aleutian Islands. It spends most of its life at s ea, but unlike other seabirds, flies inland to nest in the fo rest on mossy platforms near the tops of old-growth trees (Nelson 1997). Marbled Murrelets are currently listed as a threatened species in Californi a, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia, but are relatively abundant in Alaska, where an estimated 91% of the world's population ex ists (McShane et al. 2004). Estimates of the Alaska population are dr iven in large part by a single at-sea survey conducted by the USFWS in 1994, which placed the population in Southeast Alaska at 687,061 (\u00b1201,162) Brachyramphus murrelets (Agler et al. 1998). By these estimates, Southeast Alaska alone contains approximately 65% of the worl d's Marbled Murrelets, making it the geographic and demographic epicenter of the bird's range. Juvenile Marbled Murrelet R. MacIntosh, USGS A number of studies have demonstr ated that Marbled Murrelets have declined dramatically in the southern half of their range, primarily due to lo ss of suitable nesting ha bitat from logging (Bryant et al. 1997; McShane et al. 2004). In the Pacific Northwest, approximately 5% of the original, coastal, old-growth forest remains. Other fact ors that may contribute to the decline include increased predation (by crows, jays, and other corvids), entanglement in gillnets, and oil pollution. Like other seabirds, the Marble d Murrelet has low f ecundity, becoming sexually mature between 3 and 5 years old, and then laying only a single egg per year. Because it nests in trees, it is exposed to avian predators in the form of rave ns, crows, Steller's Jays, Northern Goshawks, Peregrine Falcons, and various owls. Preferred ne sting habitat is 20-40 meters up in old-growth trees. Murrelets prefer to nest near the tops of trees but beneath overhanging limbs to provide cover from overhead predators. The bird does not add material to a nest , but looks for a broad, mossy platform that occurs naturally in these wet forests. Because the platform must be broad to support the bird, it nests primarily in older trees that have had tim e to develop these structures. Research on nesting habits of these birds suggest s that within forest stands, Marbled Murrelets tend to select for older, larger trees (Hamer and Nelson 1995). Ol der trees tend to have larger limb structures and larger moss platforms, whic h provide more suitable nesting sites for the 665 Appendix 5.1, Page 14 birds. The disproportionate logging emphasis on larger trees (e.g., high-gr ading) in Southeast Alaska may be having a dispropor tionately high impact on the nesti ng habitat of these birds. One of the essential attributes of old-growth fore st is the existence of gaps in the canopy that allows Marblet Murrelets to acc ess nest stands and fly below the canopy. Conservation of these types of forest stands is impor tant for the long-term conservati on of murrelet nesting habitat. Other species In the case of the Marbled Murrelet, coastal old-growth forests provide important structural attributes needed for nesting and reproduction. Other species, including many woodpeckers and owls, depend on large-diameter snags for excavat ing cavities for nesting and roosting, or in the case of the Rufous Hummingbird, bu ild their nests from the mosses and lichens they find in old- growth forests. Other species depend on coastal forests because their primary food lives in the forest. Examples include the No rthern Goshawk, which hunts beneath the overstory and captures a variety of old-growth associated birds and small mammals, or the brown creeper, which forages in the bark crevices of larger, old-grow th trees. Still other anim als are dependent on the perpetually moist, humid environment of the ra in forest, including species like the rough-skinned newt, the wood frog, and long-toed salamander. The coastal, old-growth rain forest is an ex traordinarily complex, stable habitat type. Over thousands of years, many wildlife species have evol ved in special ways to exploit this forest for food, shelter, and security. The ecological web of in teractions in the coastal rain forest is rich, and understanding of its complexities is only now starting to emerge through ongoing scientific study. Coastal Temperate Rain Forest Conservation Status Coastal temperate rain forests are rare worldwide. Only 30-40 m illion ha (2-3%) of the world's estimated 1.3 billion ha of temperate forest can be classified as coastal temperate rain forest (Ecotrust et al. 1995). Alaska contains approximately 6,649,460 ha of coastal temperate rain forest, of which about 800,000 ha has been altere d by human impacts (Ecotr ust et al. 1995). Most of this development has come in the form of clearcut logging and associated road building, especially on the more productive fo rest lands in Southeast Alaska. Some of the more intensively logged areas in Southeast Alaska include the northern half of Prince of Wales Island, northern Kuiu Island, Nort heast Chichagof Island, North Mitkof Island, Heceta Island, Tu xekan Island, and Long Island. Heavily logged areas overlap to a great extent with underlying calcium carbonate so ils, or karst, which allows for good drainage and more productive tree growi ng conditions. There has been less logging in Southcentral Alaska and the Kodiak Archipelag o, primarily because tree size and growth rates diminish with increasing latitude (Farr and Ha rris 1979). Logging on privat e, Native corporation lands has been significant throughout this biome, accounting for approximately half of all logged areas. Over 95% of the coastal temperate rain forest land lies within the Tongass and Chugach National forests\u2014two of the largest national forests in the United States. These lands are managed for multiple uses, including a mix ranging from wilder ness to intensive development. The allocation 666 Appendix 5.1, Page 15 of lands to conservation or development status is governed by a comprehensive Forest Plan, which is developed through a public process, and revised every 10-15 years. The Tongass is currently managed under a Forest Plan that was finalized in 1997. The Chugach is managed under a Forest Plan that was re vised in 2001. About 22% of the T ongass National Forest is zoned for development, and about 18 % of the forested acres of the Tongass are currently available for commercial timber harvest purposes ( http://www.fs.fed.us/r10/ TLMP/ROD/ROD_COV.PDF ). About a third of that available forested acreage has been harvested since the 1950s. Although a relatively small percenta ge of the forest area has been logged, much of the logging to date has been concentrated in the most productiv e stands with the largest trees. Not only are \"big-tree\" forests unique stru cturally and functionally (Kirch hoff and Schoen 1987), but they tend to occur in certain landscape positions that make them especially valuable to particular wildlife species. For example, big tree forests ar e often found on alluvial so ils (the flood plain of rivers and streams), or on colluvial soil types (the toe slopes of steep hill sides), where species like brown bears ( al . 1988). These floodplains and a lluvial soils are often also associated with highly productive streams and aquatic habitats. The disproportionate harvest of relatively rare, \"big-tree\" stands has been a primary conservation concern in Southeast Alaska for decades (Kirchhoff 1989; Keister and Eckhardt 1994). Maintaining sustainable and well-di stributed populations of all fi sh and wildlife species should focus on preserving the natural dive rsity of forest conditions (sp ecies, structure, and landscape position) within this biome. Threats to Alaska's boreal forest and coastal te mperate rain forest habitat range from minor, short-term impacts that may occur in association with virtually any fores tland use activity, to the potentially significant loss of hab itat due to the conversion of fo restlands to other uses. These losses may be partial or complete, but they ar e often permanent changes to the landscape. Timber harvesting activities, if properly planned and implemented, should result in only short- term impacts to the forest habi tat. If, however, harvest activi ties are not conducted in accordance with appropriate best management practices (BMP s), such as those found in regulation under the Forest Resources and Practices Act, there is the possi bility that they will affect slope stability or disrupt soil regimes. These in tu rn could lead to such impacts as increased soil erosion or even mass wasting, reduced natural regeneration or sh ifts in vegetative species composition, impacts to water quality, excessive windthr ow, and increased fire risk. Many timber roads and landings constructed for ha rvest are temporary or seasonal. If properly constructed with issues such as drainage ad equately addressed, they represent short-term impacts. Permanent roads, however, can lead to long-term impacts asso ciated with habitat fragmentation. The fragmentation of forest habitats is a more significant threat to wildlife because it tends to be long term. The construction of permanent roads, and the installation of pipelines and other utilities impact forested areas via ground dist urbance, the clearing of trees and understory species, as well as the bi secting of habitats. 667 Appendix 5.1, Page 16 Habitat fragmentation from road construction and pipeline installation oc curs on lands that are open to development activities regardless of ownership. These impacts can be local, such as for a subdivision road or oil pad development, or regional as is the case for many oil and gas pipelines. The construction of roads often opens areas for additional settlement or development and can lead to the loss of habita t through conversion to other uses. In May 2005 the Roadless Area Conservation Rule was repealed by the Bush Administration. This rule was issued by the USFS in January 2001 to protect areas within national forests that were currently roadless. \"Roadless areas\" are pl aces where no roads have been constructed, and where as a result, no logging or other deve lopment has occurred. These areas provide unfragmented habitats that suppor t fish and wildlife species under unaltered conditions, an increasingly rare situation. Large-scale land conversion for de velopment and settlement is th e single greatest threat to Alaska's forest habitats. The loss of forest habi tat through conversion to another use often results in a permanent loss of that habitat. Many of these land use conversions are relatively unregulated, at least in comparison to timber ha rvest activities. The FRPA (Forest Resources and Practices Act) does not apply to th e clearing of timber in order to convert the land to another use, and there is no comparably comprehensive act that addresses the development of land for uses such as agriculture, golf courses, mining, subdivi sion development, or other commercial uses. Mining activities in Alaska threaten forest habitats by conversion, and may contribute pollution to associated waters from mine tailings and ch emicals used during the extraction process. Recent advances in technology have allowed for the us e of lower grade ores and spurred renewed interest in mining operations. Lastly, impacts such as insect infestation, simila r to the spruce bark be etle that may flourish under warming climatic conditions, will likely c ontinue to alter Alaska's forest habitats. The Alaska FRPA and its associ ated regulations govern commerci al timber harvest activities on state, municipal, and private forestlands. This st atue identifies and requi res the use of specific best management practices (BMPs) for timber ha rvest activities. The Alaska Department of Natural Resources Division of Forestry (DOF) ad ministers the provisions of the act and provides oversight of commercial forest harv est activities pursuant to FRPA. The Department of Environmental Conserva tion (DEC) and DNR's Office of Habitat Management and Permitting (OHMP) coordinate with the DOF in implementing FRPA and perform specific oversight roles themselves. DEC is given deference in matters related to water quality issues, and the OHMP receives deference in regard to the protection of riparian buffers within harvest areas. Timber harvest activities on federal forestla nds are not subject to FRPA; however, the management standards on federal land generally meet or exceed the FRPA standards. Most timber harvest occurs on Alaska's 2 national forest s, and falls under the re gulatory jurisdiction of 668 Appendix 5.1, Page 17 the USFS. The forest planning process allows for public review and has a large public involvement component. The State of Alaska owns approximately 24.9 million acres of forested lands (Department of Commerce Community and Economic Development 2005). The use of these lands is regulated by area or regional plans. Generally, regional plans have been developed, or will be developed under the sustainable yield and multiple use principles and for consistency with AS 41.17. Regional plans have been completed for about two- thirds of all state land. Where no plan exists, a site-specific plan must be adopted under AS 38.04.065(h) to classify the land before a timber sale can occur. Approximately 2 % of the state's forested lands , or just over 2 million acres, is within 2 designated state forests. The 247,000-acre Haines State Forest, established by the legislature in 1982, includes the Chilkoot, Chilkat and Ferebee drainages in the northern portion of Southeast Alaska. In Interior Alaska, the 1.8 million-acre Ta nana Valley State Forest, which extends from Manley to Tok, was created in 1983. The primary purpose in establishing state forests is to provide for the production, utilization, and re plenishment of timber resources while allowing other beneficial uses of public land and resources (AS 41.17.200[a]). The DOF manages forests on state land that ha ve been classified as timberlands via implementation of the FRPA. The FRPA delineates 3 management regions: Region I, Region II, and Region III. These regions correlate with the S outheast, Southcentral, and Northern areas of the state. The FRPA establishes district ri parian standards for each of these regions. The DOF plans for timber management on state la nds by first reviewing ex isting regional plans to ensure that proposed actions are consistent, and then prep aring a Five-Year Schedule of Timber Sales. These schedules are prepared a nnually by each of the DOF's 10 area offices, and provide the public, the timber i ndustry, and agencies with an overview of proposed timber harvest areas, timber sale access and reforestation plans. The next step is preparation of a Forest Land Use Plan (FLUP) for each proposed timber sale or personal use harvest area on state lands. FLUP s provide information on the location, access, harvest methods, duration, and proposed reforestation for individual sale. FLUPs are required to follow the multiple use and sustained yield princi ples. Consideration must be given to current, past, and potential uses of the land, including timber harvesting fo r commercial and personal use; fish and wildlife habitat; water bodies, water qual ity and watersheds; riparian, wetland and ocean shoreline vegetation; recreati on and tourism; agriculture and grazing; mining and material extraction; and soil characteristics. FLUPs are subject to public and agency review for sale approval or denial. Current FLUPs exist for Fairbanks, Delta, Kenai-Kodiak (combined), Northern Southeast (Haines), southern Southeast (Ketchikan), and the Matanuska-Susitna areas. Once a timber sale is adopted, a contract is issued either through the bid process or via negotiations. The FRPA requires th at timber operators submit a Detailed Plan of Operation (DPO) for timber harvest activities that are subject to the Act. In addition to state lands, this includes harvests on municipal and private forestland. 669 Appendix 5.1, Page 18 State timber sales with the Coastal Zone must be consistent with the ACMP and local Coastal Zone Management Plans. The standards containe d in the FRPA are the coastal standards for timber harvesting, so if timber sales comply with the act, they are consistent. The DOF must issue proposed and final coastal consistency determinations under the timelines set by 11 AAC 150. As mentioned above, timber harvests on munici pal and private lands are also subject to provisions found in the FRPA. These provisions apply to the harvest activities themselves; municipal and private lands do not typically have a planning process that is analogous to that for state lands. The FRPA does treat municipal and private lands diffe rently from state lands with regard to riparian standards. P ublic lands typically have stricter riparian standards than private lands, including having wider riparian buffers with wider no-cut zones adjacent to water bodies. In Alaska, private forestlands include those owned by Native corporati ons, universities, the Alaska Mental Health Trust Authority, and priv ate citizens. Approximately 30 million acres of Alaska's forestlands are privately owned (D epartment of Commerce Community and Economic Development 2005). Timber harves ts on municipal and privately owned forestlands within the coastal zone are regulated in the same manner as state lands. DPOs must be submitted, and the DOF is responsible for ensuring consistency by regulating adherence to the FRPA standards. Forest habitats within legislative designated Sp ecial Areas are afforded some protection from development under management plans specific to those areas. Federal forested lands fall under the jurisdiction of federal management agencies. Approximately 77 million acres of Alaska's forests are federa lly owned (Department of Commerce Community and Economic Development 2005). The USFS is respons ible for Alaska's 2 national forests, the Chugach and the Tongass. The Tongass National Forest is the largest single forest ownership in the state. It is located in Southeast Alaska and contains 46% of Alaska's timberland. The Tongass National Forest consists of 16.9 million acre s, of which 4% is available for commercial timber harvest. The second largest federally ow ned forest is the Chugach National Forest. Located in Southcentral Alaska, this forest encompasses much of the Prince William Sound area and consists of 5.3 million acres. Federal lands managed by agencies other th an the USFS are not typically managed for commercial timber harvest. There are 17 units of the National Park System in Alaska under the management of the National Parks Service; 10 were created in the 1980s through ANILCA. The USFWS manages the 16 national wildlife refuges in Alaska. Th e BLM manages its own lands specific to their land-use plans deve loped to sustain the health and di versity of natural resources. Recommended conservation actions for Alaska's forest habitats include the establishment and maintenance of protected areas, forest practices that provide for sustainable timber harvest in designated areas, support for efforts to eliminate wasteful consumption and lastly, where needed, appropriate forest re storation programs. Projects involving the development of protected forested areas, unders tanding species/habitat relationships and sustainable fore st management are critical to the conservation of Alaska's boreal forests and coastal temperate rain forests. 670 Appendix 5.1, Page 19 Monitoring and research efforts that reduce impa cts to forest habitats from mining operations, road construction, and timber harvest should be emphasized.

The absence of trees is typical ly related to regional clim atic conditions. Alaska has 3 major types of tundra that can be gene rally described by the topographical and geographical location in which they occur. They include: 1) Arctic (high latitude) tundra, 2) alpine (high altitude) tundra , and 3) the maritime tundra present on Alaska's western and southwestern coast. The dominant plant species of tundra habitats are sedges, low and dwarf shrubs, a nd graminoids interspersed with forbs, in addition to mat and cushion-forming plants and scattered bryophytes (nonvascular plants). Alaska's tundra climates are characterized by a short growing s eason, long, cold, dark winters, and low precipitation with str ong, bitter, dry winds. Snow accumulation, where present, provides an insulating laye r to the ground surface benefiting plant and animal communities. The number of plant species on the tundra is few, and their growth is minimal, with most of the bioma ss concentrated in the root system. Due to the short growing season, plants often re produce by division, in addition to seed production. Arctic Tundra Arctic tundra is generally distributed above the latitudinal tree line in Alaska. This is the area from the crest of the Brooks Range northward to the Arctic Ocean known as the Arctic Slope . The Arctic Slope includes the nort h side of the mountains, northern foothills, and the flat coastal plain; it is the only truly Arctic biogeographic province in the United States. As a result of the Arctic region's high la titudinal position, it experiences less intense solar radiation and an exaggerate d seasonal variation. Arctic tundra persists under cold air conditions or iginating off the permanent sea ice pack. This air has low moisture-holding capacity combined with minimal precipitation. The dominant vegetation type across the foothills and much of the coastal plain is tussock tundra, with willows in the small drainage s, wet sedge tundra in old drained lakes, and Dryas tundra on drier ridges. Tussocks ar e formed of cottongrass and other sedges and forbs, with scattered dwarf shrubs. Prostrate woody shrubs, mosses, sedges, and lichen cover the mountainsides a nd valleys. The flat areas of the coastal plain are sporadically covered with sma ll thaw lakes and ponds and rock polygons. These landforms are due to a continuous la yer of underlying permafrost. Ice-rich permafrost is an important feature of Al aska's landscape that is not found elsewhere in the United States (Batten 1986). Trees ar e generally unable to establish in Arctic tundra habitats due to an underlying impermeable permafrost layer complemented by thin soils. These thin tundra soils trap moisture, holding it close to the surface, creating a tundra complex of wet and dry habi tats. Relative to other locations of the state, regions where Arctic tundra hab itat exists receive less annual snow and 673 Appendix 5.2, Page 2 rainfall\u2014less than 20 inches annually (Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee 2002). Arctic tundra plant communities found in me sic (dry) and hydric (wet) soil conditions include wet graminoid herbaceous types dom inated by sedges or grasses. Areas of drier soils along the riverbanks, lakes, and coastal bluffs support dwarf scrub communities. Typical mesic sedge communities are dominated by the Drepanodadus spp., may be common. Grass communities are dominated by ) prevailing where surface water is 15-200 cm deep. Common dwarf scrub communities found in the more xeric (desert-type) soils of the willow [ Salix reticulata ] and skeleton leaf willow [ S. phlebophylla ]). In addition, mesic graminoid herbaceous co mmunities dominated may be c odominant with sedges. Mosses, such as the feather moss, Hylocomium splendens, and scrub communities are dominated by mat- forming Dryas species and reticulata ] and skeleton leaf willow [ S. phlebophylla ]). Open low scrub communities are codominated by the American green alder (Alnus crispa ) and willows (Richardson willow [ Salix lanata ], diamond leaf willow [ S. planifoli ], and gray leaf willow [ S. glauca]). Mosses ( Tomenthypnum nitens and Drepanocladus spp.) may be common. In the valley and lower hill slope areas, the drier, xeric soils support dwarf scrub communities, while mesic, graminoid, herbaceous communities inhabit the wet to mesic soils. Dwarf scrub communities are dominated by ericaceous species; an example community as least Salix rotundifolia ), arctic and Cetraria spp., may with shrubs in some of these areas. Graminoid, herbaceous communities of the Arctic tundra are dominated by sedges (e.g., water sedge [ Carex aquatilis ] and [ C. ]) and willows (e.g., diamondleaf willow [ S. planifolia ] and Richardson abundant (Gallant et al. 1995). Other common mosses making up Arctic tundra drier locations. Arctic tundra G. Carroll , ADF&G The Arctic tundra is represented by a low diversity of plant sp ecies and low plant biomass. These characteristics, combined with a short growing s eason, slow rates of growth, and vegetative reproduc tion, result in delayed recovery from disturbance (Oceanographic Institute of Washington 1979). Arctic Tundra-associated Species Snowy 4 Alpine Tundra Alpine tundra occurs above tree line elevations in mountain ranges and exposed ridges in Alaska. Major mountain ranges of Alaska include the Alaska, Brooks, and Chugach ranges. Numerous, smaller ranges also occur throughout the state. At these higher elevations, the landscape is increasingly broken by rock outcroppings. Plant communities consist of prostrate, mat and cushion-forming species and shrubby species that are intermittent in their distribution. Barren and lichen-covered rocky areas are dominated by Dryas (mountain-avens) and mountain- heath communities. These plants are adapte d to the scouring high winds and widely ranging temperatures of high elevation alpine regions. Due to steep slopes and relatively thin soils at the higher elevations , areas of alpine tundr a lack trees and may or may not have permafrost. Alpine tundra, McNeil Ri ver State Game Refuge D. Tessler, ADF&G Alpine tundra transitions at lower elevations to subalp ine forests or meadows and treeline habitats. In many areas, the suba lpine region is a broad band where small islands of stunted trees are confined to sheltered sites. Subalpine plants represent the first distinctive type of vege tation below the alpine tundra. The transition to alpine tundra begins with communities dominated by shrubs, heaths and related families. Regeneration of alpine tundra plant species is often very slow following damage by fire or other disturbance. Mountain-heath dwarf shrub communities are dominated by Phyllodoce spp. occur. Dryas communities are dominated by species of the genus Dryas and codominated by dwarf shrubs, ericads, sedges or lichens. Common dwarf willows rotundifolia ), polar graminoids and herbs communities may al. 1992; Vierick et al. 1972). Golden Eagle, L. m. townsendi, ) Maritime Tundra Maritime tundra (or heath) is present along th e coastal areas of southwestern Alaska and the western Alaska Bering Sea Islands. It is the product of the cool and damp climate generated by the cold waters of the Bering Sea. Seasonal weather patterns produce relatively milder winters, cooler summers and relatively high humidity. A gradual transition occurs from maritime to Arctic tundra in the region of Kotzebue 677 Appendix 5.2, Page 6 Sound, and a transition from maritime to alpine tundra occurs where mountains extend into the region. Uplands and mountain slopes support mosses, lichens, and prostrate alpine plants, while lower areas are covered with herbaceous forbs. The latitudinal location, combined with the ma ritime climate and increased precipitation, generally defines and distinguish es this tundra from Arctic and alpine tundra types. Maritime tundra is dominated by prostrate he ath-scrub type communities interspersed with grass and forb meadows, with willo ws and alders present in the species include herbaceous communities are dominated by tussock-forming sedges in some areas, or by bluejoint, which fo rms meadows with codominant tundra ADF&G Dwarf scrub communities of the maritime tundra are composed of low shrubs, grasses, and lichens. Communities are dominated by mountain-avens (Dryas octopetala and D. integrifolia) or codominated spp., and Cladina spp. Other typical shrubs occurring in these communities are prostrate willows (netleaf willow [ Salix reticulata ] and skeletonleaf willow [ S. phlebophylla as Tomethypnum nitens, and Rhytidium rugosum, may be common. Tall scrub communities are dominated by willows, including feltleaf S. glauca). may also occur. A thick herbaceous layer is present in some areas consisting subspecies Northern Rock Sandpiper, C. p. tschuktschorum Bering Endemic 679 Appendix 5.2, Page 8 Ecological Role of Tundra Habitats Alaska tundra habitats are somewhat unique relative to the co ntiguous United States. Although tundra is found in th e higher elevations of th e Lower 48, it is Alaska's Arctic tundra habitat that may be most fam iliar to the nation. This is primarily due to the high profile of development issues and c oncerns in the Arctic region, especially as it relates to the future of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). Alaska's tundra supports numerous av ian migratory species during the spring, summer, fall and winter seasons, providing important breeding, rearing, staging, refugia, and overwintering habitat. It is one of the most productive and abundant habitats for shorebirds in Alaska and s upports a diversity of breeding species. In addition, mammalian species, including mus kox, caribou, foxes, wolves, bears, arctic ground squirrels, many small rodents, and ra ptors are widespread across the Arctic tundra. Nomadic caribou depend on tundra vege tation most of the year for survival, including during annual migrations to th eir calving grounds. Migratory species, such as falcons and terns, also use this habitat. Five species of raptor s that regularly breed in the Arctic tundra region include th e Peregrine Falcon, Gyrfalcon, Rough-legged Hawk, Short-eared Owl, and Snowy Owl. Rapt ors specialize in eating the lemmings, voles and hares that in turn are adapte d to eating the tundra vegetation. Rock Ptarmigan breed on the Arctic coastal tundra. They make short migrations in winter to the foothills of the south slopes of the Brooks Range where willows, a primary food source, are more abundant (Johnson and Herter 1989). During spring, thousands of ptarmigan move north across the foothills to reach their breeding areas on the tundra. The Yellow-billed Loon is an Arctic tundra breeder that overwinters in the southern coast of the state. The Buff-breasted Sa ndpiper nests on the tundra of the Arctic coastal plain, while the Rock Sandpiper ne sts in the heath of the maritime tundra (Bowman 2004). Rock Ptarmigan and Blue Grouse feed on seeds and berries of tundra vegetation. The Gray-crowned Rosy Finch feeds in the alpine tundra and subalpine meadows of the Aleutians and Bering Sea Islands eating tiny, wind-borne seeds and insects. Smith's Longspurs nest in the alpine tundra eating mostly plants, as well as invertebrates, including spiders, ants, and beetles. Mountain goats, Dall sheep, and brown bears also depend on alpine and subalpine habitats throughout Alaska. The maritime tundra of the Yukon-Kuskokwim (Y-K) Delta of western Alaska is one of the nation's most important nesting areas for geese, including the Tule White- fronted Goose. Large numbers of ducks, t undra swans, and sandhill cranes also nest on the maritime tundra of western Alaska, particularly on the Y-K River delta. The Spectacled Eider and Steller's Eider, both federally listed as threatened (in 1993 and 1997, respectively) breed here, although Steller's Eider has become increasingly rare in this area. Most of the world's Bristle -thighed Curlews bree d on The USFWS listed the Bristle-thighed Curlew as a species of concern in 1996. McKay's Bunting is endemi c to several Bering Sea Islands, where it breeds on the maritime tundra. This habitat is particularly important in sustaining existing healthy populations of this species. 680 Appendix 5.2, Page 9 Conservation Status Alaska's tundra habitat is generally healthy. Localized development will likely continue to result in habita t alteration. Opportunities s hould be sought that alleviate negative impacts and maintain connectivity, as well as suitable areas of quality habitat important to the sustainability of species. Tundra habitats are increasi ngly susceptible to impacts from oil exploration and development, mining, transportation corridors , and associated human activities. This is particularly true in the Arctic Nort h Slope region, where existing, proposed and active state and federal oil and gas leases co ntinue to influence the Arctic ecosystems. Red Dog Mine, an active operation near the village of Kivalina, is currently the world's largest zinc mine. Projects with potential imp acts to jurisdictional tundra located with the state's designated coastal zone are subject to a review process via the ACMP that has historically been designed to avoi d, minimize and mitigate impacts to wetland habitats, including tundra. Much of Alaska 's tundra habitats are jurisdictional wetlands (see wetlands conserva tion status) subject to the regulatory authority of the COE under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Any placement of fill for road development, work pads, stream crossings, or material site development requires a permit from the COE which triggers a revi ew by federal and state agencies and a public review under NEPA. Best management practices and policies to avoid, minimize, and mitigate for unavoidable impacts to tundra habitats s hould be implemented at all levels of government. Cooperative working relationships, combined with expert knowledge regarding tundra habitats, are an importan t tool for managing and protecting these areas. Identifying and protecting areas impor tant to maintaining fish and wildlife diversity should continue. In addition, citizens should be in volved in the development of management agreements for the conserva tion and sustainable use of fish, wildlife and tundra landscapes.

Alaska's wetlands occupy 43.3% of the state's 403,247,700 acres. This contrasts with the contiguous United States, where only 5.2% of the 1.9 billion ac re land surface is composed of wetlands (Society of Wetland Scientists 1998). Wetla nd habitats in Alaska are numerous and complex; this conservation strategy highlight s and provides simplified descriptions of a few of the wetland types found in Alaska . Alaska's CWCS strategy focuses on 4 main types of wetlands: bog, grass wetla nd, sedge wetland, and salt marsh. Wetland habitats can be isolated, ephemeral, or located in riparian areas hydrologically connected to surface waters of rivers, stream s, and lakes. Small wetlands, even those without visible surface connec tions, are joined to stream systems by ground water, subsurface flows of water, and periodic surface flows, such as spring runoff. Significant wetlands also occur along the coas tline and adjacent to river deltas, and within forests throughout the state. Wetlands are abundant in the valleys and basins associated with Alaska river systems, including the Yukon, Kuskokwim, Porcupi ne, Tanana, and Koyukuk Rivers. The major river deltas also possess large wetland ar eas. One of the world's largest coastal deltas, the Yukon-Kuskokwim delta, suppor ts several wetland types. Other predominant wetland deltas of Alaska includ e the Colville River delta on the Beaufort Sea Coast, the Copper River Delta in south central Alaska, and the Stikine River Delta in Southeast Alaska (Hall et al. 1994). Bog habitats represent many thousands of y ears of wetland succession. In contrast to young freshwater wetland with only shallow organic material overlying mineral substrate, a bog consists of several feet of peat deposits. Bogs are characterized by spongy peat deposits, acidic waters, and an overlying vegetative layer of thick sphagnum moss. Peat forms when decom posing remains of mosses and sedges are left undisturbed and gradually accumulate as deep peat deposits. Bog habitat classifications include shrub-bog and fore sted-bog types, depending on successional stage of the landscape. Furthe r classifications of Alaska 's bog habitat have been developed based on water supply, distribu tion, and physiognomy (Batten and Murray 1982). Most of Alaska's wetlands are bogs, covering approximately 110 million acres. Bogs receive most of their water from rain fall rather than from runoff, streams or ground water infiltration. As a result of th is, and combined with acidic conditions, bogs are low in nutrients necessary for plan t growth. Flora and fauna that live in bogs demonstrate many special adaptations to cope with the low nutrient levels, water- 683 Appendix 5.3, Page 2 logged conditions, and acidic waters. Ever greens and shrubs are the most abundant woody plants found in bog habitats. Because bogs require a persistently wet and cool climate in order to allow the growth of peat-forming sphagnum mosses, they are predominantly found in the Northern Hemisphere. Bogs have recently been recognized for their role in regulating the global climate by storing large amounts of carbon in peat deposits. Bog habitats are particularly susceptible to destruction as they take hundreds of thousands of years to develop, ye t they can be destroyed in a matter of days. Matanuska-Susitna Valley bog pond M. LaCroix, DNR Bog habitats often support wetland tree sp ecies dominated by dwarf black spruce (Picea mariana ) (less than 10 ft tall at matur ity). Black spruce communities are common near tree line in the Interior, Southcentral, and western Alaska on cold, wet sites just barely capable of supporting trees. Dwarf occur. Dwarf tree cover is 25-60 percent in these areas. In Southeast Alaska, common bog tree species include lodgepole ) are the dominant bog tree species al ong the Gulf of Alaska coast. Other dominant shrubs commonly present in Alaska's bog environs include sweet gale ( Myrica gale), Alaska bog willow in Southeast which are common in Interior, Southcentral and southwestern Alaska. Bog rosemary bog cranberry ( also be commonly present. Frequently occurring graminoid species include loose flower alpine sedge polysepalum ) may also be present. Plant cover is generally complete, or nearly so, in bog habitats (Viereck 1972, 1992). Mosses (Sphagnum spp.) may account for 50-100% of the ground cover. Lichens may be present or wetlands are dominated (50% or greater) by water- tolerant grass species. The grasses may occur in clumps or tussocks and may be intermixed with pure stands of sedges, subjected to fluctuating water regimes. The wetter sites generally are hummocky. Woody plants and lichens are absent. Aquatic mosses may occur seasonally. The soil substrate associated with grass wetlands is generally organic or mineral rich. In addition to providing important wildlife habitat, they perform as ground water recharge areas, storing stor m and floodwaters that help ma intain minimum base flows critical for downstream aquatic resources. Dry Creek grass wetlands, Matanuska-Susitna region B. McCracken , ADF&G Alaska's grass wetlands plant communities are classified as mesic graminoid herbaceous by Viereck et al. (1992). Exampl 5.3, Wood Frog, Rana sylvatica Southeast Alaska Endemic sitkensis Long-tailed vole, Island beaver, monticolus complex Sedge wetland are typically inundated with water. Trees, shrubs, and lichens are absent, but aquatic mosses may be present (Viereck et al. 1992). Sedges make up the largest genus of plants in Alaska and consist of erect, rooted, water-loving vegetation. The USDA-NRCS (Tande and Lipkin 2003) National Plants Database identifies 155 species, subspecies and varieties of sedges in Alaska, of which 113 can be found in wetlands. Spring Creek sedge wetland M. LaCroix, DNR Sedge wetlands occur in very wet areas of floodplains, slow-flowing margins of ponds, lakes, streams, and sloughs and in depressions of upland areas throughout western, Interior, Southcentral, and Sout heast Alaska and the Aleutian Islands 686 Appendix 5.3, Page 5 (Viereck et al. 1992), generally in orga nic-rich muck substrate. Common plant communities occurring in these areas incl ude a list mainly from the species Carex , Eriophorum, or Juncus. Other plant communities of sedge wetlands co mmonly found in Southcentral, Interior and areas of the state sedg e mats in water-filled lakes, ponds, and depressions are common and may consist of communities such as Russet salt-tolerant plants . The salt marsh ecosystem falls between the mean high watermark and the lower intertidal zone. Alaska has 345,000 acres of salt marsh wetlands (Doyle 1998) a nd has 33,000 miles of coastline. Yet salt marsh habitat in Alaska represents only two- tenths of one percent of the state's total wetlands, and only 4% of the total vegeta ted tidal marshes in the United States. Salt marshes are typically located at river mouths; behind barrier islands, coves, and spits; and on tide flats where low energy wave action and fine sediment deposits provide elevated land for marsh vegetation to establish. They are located at mid to upper intertidal elevations and characterized by salt-tolerant plan t communities such as certain types of sedges and grasses. Sp ecies composition and di stribution patterns of salt marsh vegetation communities can vary distinctly based on differences in elevation, drainage, and soil ty pe. Some of the nation's mo st extensive complexes of 687 Appendix 5.3, Page 6 salt marsh habitat occur along the Alaska co ast of the Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea, Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska (Society of Wetland Scientists 1998). Common Alaska salt marsh sp ecies include hairgrass beringensis ). Hair grass communities are often found in the coastal areas of southern Alaska, typical ly in well-drained areas with mesic to dry soil characteristics. Salt-tolerant species of creeping alkali grass (Puccinellia spp.) and other halophytic forbs found along coastal (Tande and Lipkin 2003; Viereck et al. 1992; be present. Coastal marshes in the northern part of the state support sedg e species Mallotus villosus Ecological Role of Wetlands Local landscape features, including the hydrology, water quality, vegetation communities, soil features, and invertebrate communities, determine the biogeography of Alaska's wetland-associated species. Species differ in their resource requirements for the completion of life stages as well as in their spatial and temporal patterns of wetland use. Many species use more than one type of wetland habitat due to resource limitations of one that are offered by another. Wetlands are one of the most productive hab itats and are importan t in preserving the state's biological diversit y. Alaska's wetland habitats are heavily used as summer staging and breeding grounds for hundreds and thousands of migratory birds that use all 4 North American flyways to reach th eir wintering grounds. The expansive and varied wetland habitats of the Copper River Delta (CRD), for example, are of international importance as staging areas for millions of migrating shorebirds. Large wetland areas such as the CRD are extremely valuable because they provide large, whole, and intact complexes. The Le sser Yellowlegs Sandpiper and Solitary Sandpiper eat ch as diving beetles, dragonfly nymphs, and flies, as well as sand fleas and in tertidal amphipods provided by salt marsh wetlands. Waterfowl and waterbirds are wetland-dependent, and many species of songbirds nest and/or feed in wetland ha bitats. Numerous birds and small mammal species survive on the variety of seeds pr ovided by wetland plants. Raptors and owls often frequent wetlands to forage. For exam ple, species such as the Great Gray Owl search for unsuspecting prey in the clearings of bog habitat. Threespine and ninespine stickleback provide an essentia l prey source for piscivorous birds such as grebes. Fish use wetland habitat for spawning, rearing, and re fugia. In turn, brown bears forage for returning salmon in these same locations . Amphibians breed in wetlands, and many spend their entire lives in wetlands. 689 Appendix 5.3, Page 8 Damselflies and dragonflies also use wetlands as their breeding and feeding grounds, as well as for cover. They are impressive predators on insects, such as aphids and mosquitoes. The olive-sided flycatcher feeds almost exclusively on flying insects, especially bees, wasps, winged ants, aphids and beetles. Voles are year round meadow residents that eat meadow grasses and seeds. They build distinctive runways crissc rossing through the area. They also dig underground tunnels, where they construct food and nesting chambers. During the winter in snow-covered areas, the voles make runways beneath the snow and feed on the snow- flattened grasses. Voles and other small rodents are the staple foods of weasels, martens, foxes, coyotes, all owls, most hawks, inland breeding gulls, jaegers, and occasionally Great Blue Herons, domestic cats, northern pike, and other voles (Osborn 1994). Blue Grouse forage in bogs for berries and insects. Wetland grasses and sedges provide habitat structure for produc tion of invertebrates, crustaceans, and insect larvae that many species of animals depend on. Copper River Delta wetland B. McCracken, ADF&G Salt marsh habitat provides marine, freshw ater and terrestrial species a host of resources that may vary with tidal stage. For some species, access to the salt marsh is essential to a life function, while other species use salt marshes more opportunistically. Salt marsh wetlands pr ovide spawning and nursery habitat for many marine invertebrates and fishes, in cluding forage fish species, such as stickleback, and commercially sought specie s, such as Dungeness crab and Pacific herring. Salt marsh zooplankton, such as copepo ds, play an essential role in the food web conversion between phytoplankton and la rger animals. Copepods feed on most phytoplankton species and occasionally on the juvenile stages of smaller copepods. Herring and smelt feed on copepods and amphipods provided by the salt marsh. Across the state, salt marshes provide resti ng habitat for geese, ducks, and shorebirds during migration. Raptors, such as Merlin, search for small mammals seeking refuge in the salt marsh. Although the salt marsh environment is harsh with regular fluctuations in salinity and water inundation, it provides a constant so urce of differing foods due to differential decomposition rates of resident plant species. This is an important difference not afforded by habitats having more seasonal av ailability of resour ces. Plant and animal species' ecological interaction plays a vital role in the healthy function of all wetland 690 Appendix 5.3, Page 9 habitats. For example, wetland fauna facili tate decomposition of organic matter and enhance nutrient regeneration; they also serv e as food for a variety of higher trophic levels. Conservation Status Alaska's wetland habitat is generally healthy. Localized development will likely continue to result in habita t alteration. Opportunities s hould be sought that alleviate negative impacts and maintain connectivity, as well as suitable areas of quality habitat important to the sustainability of species. Threats to Alaska's wetlands include filli ng and dredging activities that fragment and block hydrologic processes and result in th e elimination of and/ or degradation of wetland habitat. These impacts are largely associated with transportation corridor construction, utility insta llation, natural resources extraction, and other development projects that result in wholesale wetland conversion. Wetlands in Alaska are regulated through a permitting process ad ministered under the Clean Water Act (CWA) by the EPA, through the COE. Pursuant to Section 404 of the CWA and Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, the COE regulates the placement of fill and certain ground-distur bing activities within jurisdictional wetlands. Under Section 404 any unauthorized discharge of dredged or fill materials from a point source into navigable waters of the United States is prohibited. The specific intent of Congress in implementing Section 404 of the CWA is to address wetland alteration. EPA investigates potential illegal wetlands de struction and permit violations. In addition, Section 301 of the CWA pr ohibits any person from discharging pollutants from a point source without a permit. The issuance of individual and \"nationwide\" permits for these activities is subject to public review. If a project in wetlands requires an individual permit and is also located within the state's designated coastal zone, then that project is also subject to a state coastal review. The state's review of federal authorizations is coordinated by DNR's Office of Project Management and Permitting (OPM P). The COE cannot issue an individual permit until the state has itself issued a de termination that the proposed project is consistent with the state's own coastal standards (found in 11 Alaska Administrative Code [AAC] 112) and any applicable loca l coastal district standards (adopted pursuant to 11 AAC 114). The Alaska Coastal Management Program is predicated upon and made possible by the federal Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) of 1972 (16 USC 1451-1465). The CZMA provides funding and regulatory structure for Alaska's program. The purpose of the state's program as articulate d by its mission statement is to \"provide stewardship for Alaska's rich and diverse coastal resources to ensure a healthy and vibrant Alaskan coast that efficiently sust ains long-term economic and environmental productivity.\" Along the way, it provides the state and local coastal districts with the necessary tools to avoid, minimize, and mitigate for impacts to important and productive coastal resources, such as wetlands. 691 Appendix 5.3, Page 10 For federal regulatory and permitting purposes, the COE defines wetlands as \"those areas that are inundated or sa turated at a frequency and dur ation sufficient to support, and under normal conditions do support, a pr evalence of vegetati on typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions.\" An important conservation action for Alaska 's wetland habitat is to continue the effort of wetland mapping. Although wetlands are the predominant habitat in the state, wetland mapping and inventory status in Alaska is substantially behind efforts elsewhere in the nation. The USFWS Na tional Wetlands Inventory (NWI) has finalized mapping for approximately 35% of Alaska's wetlands (W. Pearson, USFWS National Wetlands Coordinator, Anchorag e, personal communication) (See NWI Region 7 map on page 14 of this appendix). The USFWS is required by Section 401 of the Emergency Wetlands Resources Act of 1986 to report each decade to Congress on the status and trends of the nation's wetlands. The USFWS published a report in 1994 entitled the Status of Alaska's Wetlands (Hall et al. 1994). This report is currently due for an update. Currently there are no statewide efforts to inventory and monitor the health of the state's wetland resources in terms of water quality. The USFWS defines wetlands as \"lands where saturation with water is the dominant factor determining the nature of soil deve lopment and the types of plant and animal communities living in the soil and on its surface. The single feature that most wetlands share is soil or subs trate that is at least peri odically saturated with or covered by water. The water creates severe physiological problems for all plants and animals except those that are adapted for life in water or in saturated soil.\" The NWI mapping has limitations in that some wetland habitats are excluded from the NWI report including seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and nearshore coastal waters (i.e., salt marsh). In addition, Alaska's NWI is conducted at a 1:60,000 scale (G.F. Tande, personal communication); thus, many small ye t important wetlands are undetected in the survey. These are important details to note as Alaska looks forward to the assessment of its own wetland resources. The most recent wetlands status report, entitled Status and Trends of Wetlands in the Conterminous United States, covers the timeframe of 1986 to 1997 (Dahl 2000). A 2005 update to this report is scheduled fo r release by early 2006; however, neither Alaska nor Hawaii are included (G.F . Tande, personal communication). The information presented in this report provi des a means to evaluate existing federal programs and policies, identify national or regional wetlands issues, and increase public awareness of and appreciation for we tlands. Alaska's wetlands losses continue to be unmonitored, and the state's baseline inventory has yet to be completed. Given the predominance of wetland habitats in Alaska and their value as essential habitat for many species, the completion of the stat e's wetland mapping i nventory should be considered one of the most important conservation measures for implementation. An Alaska NWI would be instrumental in analyzing government policy, establishing state policy and legislation for the prot ection of wetland resources, and setting internal guidelines. 692 Appendix 5.3, Page 11 In addition to completing the stat e's wetland mapping inventory, wetland conservation actions should be created for activities such as timber harvesting and road construction, transpor tation corridors, grazing, development and recreation, agriculture, and mining. To complement the conservation measures, a robust mitigation plan should be developed and implemented for all unavoidable impacts that occur to wetland habitats. The mitiga tion plan should address 5 basic type of compensatory mitigation, including restor ation, creation, enhancement, exchange, and preservation. Land acquisiti on is a beneficial means to protect wetland areas; however, it does not account for potential ne t loss of wetland habitat. Landowner incentives to protect wetland ha bitats should be encouraged. Best management practices and policies to avoid, minimize, and mitigate for unavoidable impacts to wetland habitats should be implemented at the State and local government planning levels. Alaska's Duck Stamp Program, for example, provides annual funding for wetland acquisition and enha ncement projects through the sale of state duck stamps and prints to the public. This program established in state law (AS 16.05.130) directs that money accruing to the state from hunters' waterfowl conservation tag fees may not be diverted to a purpose other than 1) the conservation and enhancement of waterfowl; 2) the acquisi tion, by lease or otherwise, of wetlands that are important for waterfowl and public us e of waterfowl in the state; 3) waterfowl related projects approved by the commissione r; 4) the administra tion of the waterfowl conservation program, and 5) emergencies in the state as determined by the governor (The Biodiversity Partnership 2003). Because Alaska's land ownership remains mostly in large blocks of state and federal holdings (approximately 64% federal, 25% state, 0.7% private, and 10% Native corporation; U.S. Department of the Inte rior 2004), it is conducive to implementing large-scale conservation effo rts that minimize wetland loss and avoid disruption of drainage patterns and habitat fragmentati on. In addition, best ma nagement practices adapted at the local and regional level can be particularly effective in protecting habitats under immediate pressure from developmental impacts. Government agencies with water rights ju risdiction should strive to set minimum flow rates and levels for streams and lakes that maintain ecologically viable aquatic systems, including wetlands. Wetland conservation actions that deve lop a better understanding of wetland- associated functions and the importance of wetlands to fish and wildlife species should include the efforts to identify the st ate's wetland-dependent species, including the less mobile species, for example, amphibians versus waterfowl. In addition, Alaska's should identify specific wetland habita ts required of the associated species and focus on protection and restoration of these wetland types in complexes that account for the spatial requirements of speci es. Lastly, wetland studies that identify the specific hydrologic and ecologic role(s) of indivi dual wetlands should be conducted. 693 Appendix 5.3, Page 12 Literature Cited Adam, P. 1990.

At 44,000 miles, Alaska's shoreline is more than double the shoreline for the entire Lower 48 states (ACMP 2005). This extensive shorelin e creates an impressive abundance and diversity of habitats. Five physical factor s predominantly control the distribution and abundance of biota in the inte rtidal zone: wave energy, bot tom type (substrate), tidal exposure, temperature, and most import ant, salinity (Dethier and Schoch 2000; Ricketts and Calvin 1968). The distributi on of many commercially important fishes and crustaceans with particular salinity regi mes has led to the desc ription of \"salinity zones,\" which can be used as a basis for mapping these resources (Bulger et al. 1993; Christensen et al. 1997). A new methodology called SCALE (Shoreline Classification and Landscape Extrapolation) has the ability to separate the role s of sediment type, salinity, wave action, and other factors cont rolling estuarine co mmunity distribution and abundance. This section of Alaska's CW CS focuses on 3 main types of intertidal habitat: rocky intertidal, mudflats and beaches, and eelgr ass beds. Tidal marshes, which are also intertidal habitats, are discussed in the Wetlands section, Appendix 5.3, of the CWCS. Rocky intertidal habitats can be categorized into 3 main types: (1) exposed, rocky shores composed of steeply dipping, vert ical bedrock that experience high-to- moderate wave energy; (2) exposed, wave-c ut platforms consisting of wave-cut or low-lying bedrock that experience high-to-m oderate wave energy; and (3) sheltered, rocky shores composed of vertical rock wa lls, bedrock outcrops, wide rock platforms, and boulder-strewn ledges and usually found al ong sheltered bays or along the inside of bays and coves. Rocky substrate, moderate to strong wave a nd surf exposure, and a visible, vertical zonation pattern characterize rocky intertidal habitat. Colorful communities of invertebrates and algae grow in distinct horizontal bands dominated by rockweed, mussels, or barnacles. These species' physio logical tolerance to desiccation and their competitive and predatory interactions with other species largely determine their vertical distribution. Although extensive re search has been done on intertidal community structuring processes in temper ate regions, including zonation patterns, disturbance processes, and ad aptations of organisms, relatively little work has been done in sub-Arctic regions. One differ ence between temperate and sub-Arctic ecological processes is the pronounced seasonality of intertidal community composition and biomass. Dramatic seasonal ch anges, such as the cold winter air, shorter daylight, and long winters at or above 59 degrees north latitude (delineation of sub-Arctic), all contribute to the distri bution and composition of the intertidal communities. Low light conditions in winter sharply reduce algal growth, which is 696 Appendix 5.4, Page 2 dependent on sunlight, nutrient availa bility, length and time of immersion, air temperature, and wave action. Stress from temperature changes causes high interannual variability in living biomass. The effects of these changes range from annual senescence of kelp and other macr ophytes (many of which live throughout the year in temperate climates) to extreme intertidal mortality of flora and fauna. Macroalgal species grow in abundance during the spring and summer when extended daylight creates intense primary productivity. Their biomass supports communities that inhabit not only the rocky intertidal habitat, but also those of soft-bottom habitats (Lees et al. 1980). Direct consumers in the rocky intertidal habitat include ecompose and become detritus. Detritus forms the base of the food chain for soft-bottom habitats, and it serves as food for filter feeders, such as barnacles, in other habitats. Deposit- and filter-feeding worms, clams, and other invertebrates are food for birds and fish. The transfer of biomass from the rocky intertidal habitat to other habitats ties the health and productivity of kelp and rockweed in the roc ky intertidal area to that of soft-bottom dwellers, such as Dungeness crabs ( al. 1980; Sanger and Jones 1984; ADF&G 1993). Rocky intertidal habitat at low tide, Port Graham T. Thompson, ADF&G The diversity and highly structured zonation of rocky intertidal communities fascinates researchers and tide-pool vis itors. With ample primary productivity forming the basis of an abundant food supply, space is usually the most limiting resource in rocky intertidal communities (Ricketts and Calvin 1968). The distribution of species is governed by the competiti on for living space and the need to find food and shelter while avoiding predators a nd without drying out or suffering from intolerable extremes in heat or col d. For example, competition for space among mussels, barnacles, and rockweed leads to th e formation of distinct bands dominated by these species. Although consolidated substrates do not allow animals to burrow, as 697 Appendix 5.4, Page 3 they do in soft-bottom habitats, the cracks, crevices, overhangs, and rock bottoms create microhabitats in which to hide from predators, minimize wave shock, and avoid desiccation. Rocky Intertidal-associated Species Mudflats and beaches are intertidal unconsolidated substrate habitats ranging from sheltered tidal flats to steep cobble beaches exposed to pounding waves. Each type of substrate supports a distinct biological community, including numerous species of clams, polychaete worms, amphipods, and other invertebrates. Sand and gravel beaches host similar taxa (with gravel-inhabiting forms adapted to coarser substrate), as well as sand dollars ( and sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus ). Cobble beaches are subject to greater wave exposure, and fewer species are adapted to survive the stress of pounding waves a nd grinding substrate. However, when cobble provides a protective armor over a heterogeneous mixture of silt, sand, and other unconsolidated sediments, a rich in faunal community may live beneath it. Of the unconsolidated habitats, mudflats s upport the greatest spec ies diversity and biomass, and cobble beaches support the fewest (Lees et al. 1980; Carroll and Highsmith 1994). Shorebirds feeding in mudfla t habitat ADF&G/KBRR There are 5 \"soft\" intertidal habitat types: fine-grained sand beaches, coarse-grained sand beaches, mixed sand and gravel beaches, exposed tidal flats, and sheltered tidal flats. Fine-grained sand beaches usually ar e broad and gently sloping. Coarse-grained 698 Appendix 5.4, Page 4 sand beaches are wide, steep beaches and ar e generally associated with river or stream mouths. Mixed sand and gravel beach es contain coarse-grained sands, gravel of varying sizes, and possibly shell fragmen ts. Exposed tidal flats are composed of sand and/or gravel, and are associated with lagoons f ound at the heads of coastal bays. They are exposed to moderate wa ve and tidal energy and river freshwater inputs. Sheltered tidal flats contain soft mud or muddy sand. They occur at the heads of bays and in estuarine we tlands and are exposed to low wave activity and moderate tidal currents (NOAA 1999). Mudflat and Beach-associated Species Solitary Sandpiper, Tringa Kachemak Bay ADF&G/KBRR Eelgrass (Zostera marina) grows in beds (clusters) in low intertidal and shallow subtidal sandy mudflats. Like a coral reef or kelp forest, the physical structure of the eelgrass beds provides increased living substrate and cover for myriad invertebrates and fish. The beds also generate food and nutrients for the soft bottom community through primary productivity and plant decay. Unlike kelp, eelgrass is a flowering, marine vascular plant. The size, shape, and density of the eelgrass beds vary from season to season. Eelgrass is sensitive to turbidity and changes in wate r quality. The depth to which it grows is limited by light penetration. The encrusting algae and invertebrates on the eelgrass blades (epibiota) are as impor tant as the plant itself as a food source for other species. Although eelgrass blades die in the fall, the roots and rhizomes remain dormant through the winter. The pere nnial root and rhizome sy stems stabilize the fine substrate sediments, buffering the erosive forces of tidal flushing and seasonal storms (McConnaughey and McConnaughey 1985). This interannual stability allows eelgrass to come back in following years, providi ng a relatively consistent food source and substrate for the seasonal crop of epibiota . In Alaska, eelgrass beds are distributed along sheltered, shallow portions of the coas tline, from Southeast Alaska to the Seward Peninsula. Izembek Lagoon, located on the tidelands and submerged lands of the Izembek State Game Refuge (See Figure 35, Page 131 of CWCS), is the site of one of the largest eelgrass beds in the world. The adjacent Izembek National Wildlife Refuge protects the watershed of Izembek Lagoon, including Applegate Cove 6 Ecological Role of Intertidal Habitats Alaska's expansive and varied coastline, numerous freshwater sources, and diverse geomorphology combine to form many intertidal habitat types. Rocky intertidal habitat supports a di verse and conspicuous assemblage of invertebrates and luxuriant macroalgal growth that produce more organic material than almost any other intertidal habitat (Lees et al. 1980). The uppermost intertidal band, the splash zone, is only occasionally wetted by waves. Periwinkle snails (Littorina scutulata and L. sitkana) characterize the uppermost reach of this zone. They share the splash zone with a few acorn barnacles (Balanus glandula ) and patches of black lichen ( Verrucaria sp.). Below the splash zone is the upper intertidal zone with its lower reaches characterized by a thick band of rockweed ( Fucus gairdneri ). The upper intertidal zone is exposed to air daily, so the organisms found here, such as the beach hoppers, periwinkle snails, and acorn barnacles, must be adapted to temperature, desiccation, and other stresses caused by exposure. The next zone, the mid intertidal, is periodically covered by higher low tides, offering plant and animals species here some prot ection from desiccation. Mussels ( Mytilus trossulus ) dominate but they sh are space with rockweed a nd both acorn and thatched grazers, especially spp.) are also common in the mid intertidal zone. Thatched ba rnacles often dominate space in the lower intertidal zone, and black leather chitons are comm on here as well. ) are commonly found the lower intertidal zone (Carroll and Highsmith 1994). Mudflats are an important stopover for mi grating birds such Western Sandpiper (Calidris (Calidris alpina), which depend on ice-free foraging grounds during their spring migration. Th e sandpipers are among the millions of migrating shorebirds that focus baltic macoma ( Macoma balthica ), a small clam that can provide up to 30 percent of the birds' diet during migration (Senner and West 1978). Clams are also an important food sour ce for waterfowl feed on the mudflats throughout the winter (Sanger 1983; Lees et al. 1980). Harbor seals ( Phoca vitulina ) also use mudflats and protected beaches as haul out areas (ADF&G 1993). Mudflats and beaches play an important, but poorly understood, role as nursery and spawning habitat for several commercially and recreat ionally important fish and invertebrates, including Pacific ( Cancer magister ). Pacific herring spawn in the intertidal mudflats and in the mixed sand, gravel, and mud beaches . They are an important prey for birds, marine mammals, and predatory fish. Sa nd and gravel beaches provide spawning 701 Appendix 5.4, Page 7 habitat for primary food sources for seabirds (Sanger 1983). Dense eelgrass beds serve as a refuge from predators for small fish, such as sculpins and gunnels, and invertebrates, such as (Onchorhynchus spp.), use eelgrass as a nursery area. Herring spawn on eelgrass, laying as many as 3 million eggs per eelgrass blade in the spring (Hood and Zimmerman 1986). The nutritious eg gs attract gulls, fusca deglandi ), and other birds and fish. Some species of ducks and geese, such as the Pacific brant ( Branta bernicla ), consume the plant directly, while others forage among the leaves for epifauna. Brant depend on eelgrass for food during their long migrati on from Baja California to Alaska and Canada. Almost the entire population of brant congregates each fall and spring to forage at Izembek Lagoon. Eelgrass meadows occur in shallow water, near the shore; as a result they are threatened by some types of coastal deve lopment activities. The plant is vulnerable because it has a narrow tolerance for turbidity, sediment disturbance, and eutrophication, as well as a need for hi gh ambient light. Sedimentation and water quality impacts from coastal development and logging contribute to turbidity. Excess nutrients from wastes, ferti lizers, or other sources prom ote the growth of epiphytic algae on eelgrass and phytoplankton in the wa ter column. Decreased light penetration reduces eelgrass photosynthesis and growt h. Changes in sedimentation patterns, propeller wash from boats, and other physic al disturbances can smother or uproot eelgrass from the fine sediments in which it grows. Although these threats have been documented in the Pacific Northwest and on the east coast of the United States (Wyllie-Echeverria and Thom 1994), their pot ential impacts have received little attention in Alaska. Intertidal Habitats Conservation Status While terrestrial ecosystems may contain ge ographic and other barriers, the seamless nature of the marine environment presen ts unique management challenges. Marine ecosystems are open, and everything from rich fishery stocks to oil slicks can pass easily from one place to another. Inputs and changes in physical, chemical, and biological interactions aff ecting the marine ecosystems have spatial scales\u2014ranging from the Pacific Ocean to a local geogra phic area such as a particular cove\u2014and temporal scales\u2014ranging from decades to one tidal cycle. Environmental changes in the Pacific Ocean affect local fisheries production, offering a prime example of how local issues may be controll ed by global processes (Francis et al. 1998; Hare et al. 1999; Anderson and Piatt 1999). No marine or ganism or part of the ocean can be 702 Appendix 5.4, Page 8 considered a discrete unit. Conservation ac tions should carefully consider aggregation sites and convergences that often repres ent areas of high productivity, including for the transport and dispersal of larva (Beck 2003). Conservation concerns for intertidal habita ts include shoreline development, invasive species, acute and chronic pollution, a nd overharvest. Shoreline stabilization, residential and commercial shoreline de velopment, dredging to aid marine transportation, and other human activities can destroy intertidal and shallow subtidal habitats and biological communities. Hu man activities can indirectly impact communities by introducing new species through ballast water, fouled communities on hulls, and aquaculture. Oil spills cause lasting damage to marine communities, as demonstrated by the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil sp ill. Heavy metals and other toxins accumulate in filter-feeding invertebrates, such as clams and mussels, and make their way up the food chain to contaminate humans and other predators. However, air- and sea-borne contaminants reach Alaska from distant shores as well as local sources, making their control difficult. Some biol ogical effects of oiling on Cook Inlet's intertidal environments are discussed in Lees et al. (1980). Complex policy issues, such as protecting sensitive resources from pollution and managing international fisheries, such as salmon and halibut, require a broad biological, legal, political, and economic understanding. However, a genera l lack of baselin e data and a poor understanding of natural vari ability make it difficult to determine natural versus anthropogenic impacts. While researchers and managers have studied the fisheries of crab, shrimp, and halibut, the dearth of information on noncommercial species in intertidal habitats greatly limits our ability to understa nd and respond to natural and anthropogenic changes. Large-scale ecosystem monitoring efforts, such as the GEM Program, funded by the EVOS Trustees C ouncil, will increase our understanding of large-scale patterns in the marine envi ronment. Research focused on species assemblages should focus on understanding the links between these large-scale patterns and local co mmunity patterns. Literature Cited ACMP. 2005.

Past and present volcanic activity shapes these islands, creating features such as calderas, craters, cone-shaped peaks, hot springs, ash falls, and lava flows. The islands of Southeast Alaska are part of the temperate ra in forest region, receiving close to 700 cm (300 in) of rain annually. At elevations below 500 m, dense conifer forests cloak the islands with lush undergrowth of ferns and mosses. The climate becomes harsher toward the north, and the islands are treeless. The Aleutian Island chain extends from the Alaska Peninsul a almost 1500 km to the west. Located between the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska , it is composed of sedimentary islands capped by steep volcanoes, with elevations ranging from sea level to more than 1900 m. The higher volcanoes are glaciated (World Wildlife Fund 2001). Dwarf willow shrubs occur on some islands, their prostr ate form gripping the ground because of the strong winds. Carpets of tiny wildflowers also bloom close to the ground. The marine tundra Aleutian vegetation is composed of species from both the North American and Asian continents, dominated by heath, grass and composite families. In general, 3 plant communities can be distinguished: beach communities, lowland tundra, and upland tundra (UNESCO 2005). Seals, sea li ons, walruses, sea otters and seabirds (over 40 million of 30 different species) make Alaska's coastal islands their home for at least part of the year, taking advantag e of protection from predators and abundant forage fish in the surrounding oceans. Coastal Island and Sea Gunnels Ecological Role of Coastal Is lands and Sea Cliff Habitats Abundant forage fish, such as Pacific sand lance , juvenile Pacific herring , and provide ample food supplies for the seabirds and marine mammals that make the coastal islands their home. Forage fish provide an important link in the marine food web by transferring energy from the ocean's rich plankton populations to top predators, such as seabirds and larger fish. St. Lazaria Island USFWS The many cliffs and islands serve as protecte d habitat for nesting seabirds and marine mammals. About 50 million seabirds nest in more than 2500 colonies on Alaska's coast each summer. This is 87% of all the seabirds in the United States. Most seabirds rest and sleep on the rolling waves, bu t some roost on land for a few hours a day. They gather their food from the sea either as individuals or in large feeding flocks. All seabirds lay their eggs and raise thei r young on land. The seas near Alaska supply rich sources of food for the birds and their offspring (USFWS 2005). Many bird species, such as Red-legged Kittiwakes, nest only in Alaska a nd nearby Siberia. The Pribilof Islands provide breeding habitat for virtually all of the world's 250,000 Red- legged Kittiwakes ( Rissa brevirostris ). The Aleutian Islands provide nesting habitat for more than 21 kinds of seabirds, including the Aleutian Cackling (Canada) Goose (Branta canadensis leucopareia), an endemic that nests only there. The Aleutians also host the world's largest nesting popul ations of Least Auklets and Northern Fulmars. The only northern fur seal breeding beaches in the United States are on the Bogoslof Island in the Aleutians and in the Pribilof Islands. Many of the Aleutian Islands also support the Pribilof Island shrew ( (Polystichum aleuticum ), both of which are endemic to the islands. Coastal Islands and Sea Cliffs Conservation Status The Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge (AMNWR) encompasses many of Alaska's coastal islands , headlands and reefs. Almost all of the Aleutian Islands are included in the refuge, and many areas are also included in the Aleutian Islands 707 Appendix 5.4, Page 13 Wilderness. Small areas already deve loped were excluded from AMNWR or wilderness designation. The Aleutian Islands, a group of more than 200 islands, were designated a Biosphere Reserve\u2014an intern ational recognition given by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 1976. Despite the protected status of the land, many of the animal species that live on the islands are threatened by potential or actual threats to the surrounding marine environment on which they are intrinsically dependent. The conservation problem of most concern is the decline in almost all species of fish-eating seabirds in the Aleutians. Mortality and population declin es of numerous fish-eating seabird populations has been linked to trophic cha nges in the Bering S ea ecosystem due to commercial harvests of fish and whales ove r the last 4 decades, according to a study by the National Research Council (1996). Th e recent oil spill resulting from the grounding of the Selendang Ayu, off of Unalas ka Island in the Aleutians, reminds us of the real threats these remote islands face from marine pollution. Other threats to Alaskan coastal islands and cliff habitats include habitat degradation and conversion from cattle and reindeer introduced for ranc hing; and predation on seabird colonies by foxes, also introduced for ranching. ANM WR engages in continuing efforts to eradicate rats, which are introduced pred ators of seabird colonies. Pollutants, associated primarily with military development, are locally acute.

Accessed 2/3/2005. 708 Appendix 5.4, Page 14 Featured Species-associated Marine Water Habitats : Nearshore, Shelf, Oceanic and Benthic Marine water habitats are typically subdivided into pe lagic, meaning the water column from the surface to the greatest depth, and benthic, encompassing the sea floor. The pelagic environment can be further divided into the nearshore, which includes everything inshore from 20 m dept h; the shelf, which includes everything from 20 to 200 m in depth; and the ocean ic, which encompasses the ocean deeper than 200 m. Alaska's vast offshore waters are located in subpolar and polar regions; these areas are characterized by extreme seasonal variation in light availability, generally low surface water temperatures, and seasonal variability of sea ice cover. At the low temperatures found off Alaska, sa linity generally controls the density structure. Cooling of surface water temper atures and vigorous wind mixing caused by storms promote vertical mixing. This crea tes an environment where nutrients are generally abundant, especially in su rface waters of upwelling regions. Phytoplankton, or microscopic marine plan ts, are the driving force of marine productivity, providing 99% of the direct food consumed by marine organisms. There are tens of thousands of species of phytoplankton. A sampled phytoplankton assemblage always consists of many species ; however, one species is often dominant. Individual phytoplankton sp ecies favor slightly differe nt light intensity levels, temperatures, and nutrient concentrations. Under favorable conditions, one or more species may reproduce rapidly (within hours or days) and become dominant. When conditions change, another species may prosper, so that phytoplankton communities can vary dramatically in composition and dens ity within very short time frames. With nutrients generally available due to upwelling, phytoplan kton are able to grow quickly and are abundant when light is available. However, in Alaska light availability exhibits extreme seasonal variab ility in intensity and duration so that the period of ideal growing conditions for phytoplankton may be limited to a few weeks or months. The upwelling and wind mixing that supply the nutrients to surface waters may also be a limiting factor for the resi dence time of phytopla nkton in the surface waters, by dispersing patches of phytoplankton. The unique physical characteristics of polar marine environments have resulted in many species of fish, marine mammals, and birds sharing certain life-history characteristics. Many animals migrate s easonally, taking advantage of the highly productive short summer season and moving to other environments during the winter. Many polar marine animals are long-lived and have only 1-2 offspring per year. This ensures that the species w ill persist during periods of low food supply, even if no offspring survive. Another common characteri stic of Alaskan marine animals is the capacity to store energy, commonly as fat, to survive periods when food is unavailable. This section of Alaska's CWCS focuses on 4 main types of pelagic habitat: the nearhore, shelf, and oceanic environm ents; benthic environment. 709 Appendix 5.4, Page 15 Nearshore habitat is the water column between the sea surface and seafloor in water depths up to 20 m. It includes the subtidal area adjacent to the intertidal zone. Nearshore areas have greater variability in salinity, temperature, suspended sediment concentrations, and ice scouring than shel f or oceanic habitats. Wave energy is generally higher in the nearshore than in th e deeper ocean because of breaking waves. Winds, freshwater input, ice current patte rns, and tides drive seasonal cycles of mixing and turnover in the water column; the column may be strongly stratified during one season and strongly mixed during another, depending on environmental conditions. Fresh water from glaci al rivers carries a heavy lo ad of fine sediments that decreases light penetration and biological productivity in turbid areas. Where waters with contrasting density, salinity, and other characteristics meet, floating debris and kelp may mark a rip line. Such boundary areas often contain a greater abundance of fish, birds, and marine mammals. Nearshore kelp forest ADF&G/KBRR Kelp forests growing in the nearshore ha bitat provide habita t structure, living substrate, cover, and microhabitats, as we ll as primary productivity to fuel growth. Some kelp species are perenni als; however, many are annuals that die back during the dark, long winters. Although the extent of thes e forests varies from year to year, kelp contributes substantial primary productivity and habitat complexity to the marine ecosystem. The seasonal die-off contribu tes a strong pulse of detritus to the ecosystem during low-light winter months, supporting detritivores and upper trophic levels when primary productivity in the wa ter column wanes. Eelgrass beds, which may also be considered part of the nearshor e habitat, are discussed in the Intertidal Section of this appendix. 710 Appendix Shelf habitat refers to the continental shelf th at lies at the edge of the continent; it includes waters greater than 20 m but less than 200 m deep. Continental shelves are nearly flat borders of varyi ng widths that slope very gently toward the ocean basins. The width of the continental shelf varies. Shel f widths are typically greater in areas of passive continental margins, where there is li ttle seismic or volcanic activity, because these areas are where continents are rifted apart, creating an ocean basin between them. Narrower continental shelves occur in areas of active continental margins, where plate convergence and subduction are o ccurring. Alaska has relatively narrow continental shelf habitat from Southeast to the southern boundary of the Aleutian Islands, and relatively wide continental shelf habitat in the Bering, Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. Shelf habitats are charac terized by high productiv ity that supports a wide range of animals. 711 Appendix 5.4, Page 17 Jellyfish under Arctic ice Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR) National Underseas Research Program Bearded seal, Erignathus barbatus Amphipods North Pacific whale, Balaena mysticetus Oceanic habitats begin at the abrupt change in slope that occurs at the boundary of the continental shelf on the ocean side. The steep slope extending to the ocean basin floor is called the continenta l slope. Oceanic habitats incl ude several layers of water that each has distinct charac teristics of salinity, temperature, and light intensity. The epipelagic zone, which extends between th e surface and 200 m depth, is the only area where food can be directly produced by photos ynthesis in the open ocean. Below this, the source of food is primarily from detritu s falling from the epipelagic zone. Minor 712 Appendix 5.4, Page 18 additional food sources include vertically migrating animals and chemosynthesis at hydrothermal vents. Alaska has vast oceanic habitats associated with its extensive coastline. OAR, National Undersea Research Program; University of South Carolina at Wilmington Bowhead habitats include all of the seafloor e nvironments, extending from edge of the land to the deepest ocean trench. For the purposes of the CWCS, we are only including the benthic envir onment between the continenta l shelf break, (200 m water depth) and the low-tide zone . This part of the benthic area is called the \"sublittoral zone\" by oceanographers. The benthic area be tween low tide and the high tide line is covered under the Intertidal se ction of this plan. The habitat of the sublittoral zone environment can be soft-bottom (mud, sand, shell, gravel) shell debris or rocky. Benthic communities include infauna, which are organisms that live within 713 Appendix 5.4, Page 19 sediments, and epifauna, which are organi sms that live on sediments. In general, benthic mapping information for Alaska is very limited. Cold-water corals form important benthic ha bitat in the Gulf of Alaska and off the coast of the Aleutian Islands. These coral gardens include more than 100 species of coral and are comparable in size and structure to tropical coral reefs. The Aleutian Islands have the highest coral diversity of Alaska's waters. Some of these corals have a tree-like structure and can reach height s of 3 m and widths of 7 m. Unlike many other corals, deep-sea Alaska corals don't need light to grow. Growing on the ocean floor in depths of 200 m or more, the cora ls acquire all the nu trients they need directly from the water column. Benthic Habitat-associated view of urchins and mussels at 25 m. Yury A. Zu of Ma rine Water Habitats The pelagic open water environment of n earshore, shelf, and oceanic habitats provides important nursery, feed ing, and resting habitat for numerous seabirds, fishes, marine mammals, and of course, plankton. In the shallower waters of the nearshore, photosynthesis may take place on the seafloor. In both locations, primary production 714 Appendix 5.4, Page 20 by benthic organisms creates some food, but th e vast majority of food in the pelagic zone is produced by phytoplankton through the act of photosynthesis. These phytoplankton are grazed upon by zooplankton, which in turn are consumed by carnivores and omnivores. Comm on zooplankton in these the shelf environment (K. Coyle, pers. comm.). Fish such Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida ) are common. These fish are eaten mammals (e.g., whales) feed directly on plankton, while others, such as seals, feed on fish. The water column community changes constantly as species move in to follow feeding, spawning, and seasonal migration patterns. Some species remain in the same general area, while others migrate on daily and seasonal cycles. In general, summer is the peak of fish activity and fish abundance in nearshore areas. Even species that remain in the same general location thr oughout the year are more active and may be more conspicuously colored during summer mating or nest-gua rding periods. Over longer time scales, community composition also varies in response to prey availability, water temperatures , fishing, and other factors. Benthic habitats are diverse. The grain size of the substrate is a si gnificant factor in determining which communities develop. Alon g the continental shelf in the eastern Bering Sea and much of the Gulf of Alaska, the seafloor is soft and covered with sand, mud, silt, bits of broken shell, and othe r fine materials. These soft sediments are rich in life and often inhabited by many orga nisms living within the upper layers of the seafloor (infauna) or on the surface of these seafl oor substrates (epifauna). Typical benthic communities contain a divers ity of deposit and suspension feeders, as well as predators and scavenge rs, but suspension feeders dominate. Prominent species include barnacles, king crab, bryozoan a nd other hydroids, shrimp, ascidians, anemones, sea pens, sea whips, brittle st ars, sea cucumbers, sponges, gastropods, urchins, and shrimp. Soft-bottom communities recycle nutrients from the water column and rocky habitats. Organic detritu s from kelp and other macroalgae, dead animals, zooplankton, phytoplankton, and othe r sources of nutrients and carbon rain to the bottom. Contaminants in the water co lumn also settle and accumulate in soft sediments; therefore, benthic communities are often used to th e assess presence of pollution in the water column. As burrowing species churn the sediments, they incorporate nutrients into the sediments that feed deposit feeders. Bottom-dwelling 715 Appendix 5.4, Page fish, invertebrates, decompos ers, and microbial life c onsume the contaminants and other organic materials, converting it to living biomass. These processes link the health and productivity of the soft and hard substrate communities with those communities living in the water column. In a ddition to physical factors\u2014such as light penetration, depth, and temperature\u2014predators influence the community by selectively targeting certain prey species. Some large fish such as rays (Raja spp.) physically disturb the sediments by digging pi ts. This behavior can smother or expose other buried infauna and open new areas for species to colonize, influencing community composition through disturbance. The deep-sea coral reefs, composed of cold-water corals, black coral, gorgonian corals, stony corals, sea whips, pe Aleutians provide nurseries, places to feed, shelter from currents and predators, and spawning areas fo r fish and many other species of marine life (NOAA 2005). Corals have a calcium car bonate skeleton that supports colonies of individual polyps. The polyps use stingi ng cells to capture plankton. Many of the cold-water corals are believed to be hundr eds of years old, with very low reproductive and growth rates, making them especially vuln erable to disturbance. Sea stars, basket stars, polychaetes, snails, sponges, anemones, rockfish, shrimp, and crabs are known to inhabit Alaska's cold-water coral gardens. Marine Water Habitat Conservation Status Alaska's marine waters and associated habitats are generally healthy. Localized development will likely continue to result in habitat alteration. Opportunities should be sought that alleviate negative impacts a nd provide suitable areas of quality habitat important to the sustainability of species. Alaska marine habitats provide food for ma rine plants and animals, shelter from predators, and a refuge in which to reproduce. The extensive and seamless nature of marine ecosystems puts them at risk for wa ter pollution, which can travel far from its original source, making it difficult to regulat e. Pollution from the oil industry is a major concern in Alaskan marine waters, es pecially since the o il tanker Exxon Valdez spilled 11 million gallons of oil, causing exte nsive damage to marine habitats in the Gulf of Alaska. The Exxon Valdez spill resulte d in the death of t housands of marine mammals and seabirds and long-term damage to coastal marine habitats. The recent oil spill from the shipping vessel Selenda ng Ayu in the Aleutian Islands (January 2005) reminds us that the thre at of oil contamination is always near because of extensive coastal shipping. Other threats to marine waters from oil exploration include the disposal of toxic dr illing muds, and noise pollution. Increases in marine water transport activities related to recreati onal, commercial and industrial uses place additional stress on the health of Alaska's marine waters. The growing presence of large cruise ships, bulk cargo ships, and oil carriers to Alaska's developing port facilities poses concerns related to the prope r disposal of solid waste 716 Appendix 5.4, Page 22 and gray water. Gray and black water di sposal from recreatio nal boating activities into marine waters goes essentially unregulated. Proliferation of invasive sp ecies is a significant concern relating to Alaska's marine environment. Several species, including Atlantic salmon ( Carcinus maenas ), have been identified as real or potential threats to Alas kan ecosystems in Alaska's Aquatic Nuisance Plan (ADF&G 2002). Southern marine areas are generally in more danger of invasive species than northern marine areas because most invasive species originate from southern areas , and there is more commer ce (shipping, ports, etc) in the south (ADF&G 2002). However, climat e change will bring greater levels of coastal shipping to and through the Arc tic in coming decades, increasing the likelihood of such problems as invasive spec ies and spills. Biological regime shifts leading to ecological shifts as a result of a warming climate are increasingly being documented for marine species from phytoplankton to marine mammals (Mantua and Hare 2002). Other conservation concerns for Alaska's marine environment include adverse impacts from fishing techniques, in particular on-bottom trawling (NRC 2002). Some marine habitats under federal ju risdiction are protected by the Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) initiative. MPAs are year-round cl osures designated to enhance conservation of marine or cultural res ources. In Alaska, MPAs in federal waters include the Nearshore Bristol Bay Crab Protecti on Zone, the Pribilof Islands Habitat Conservation Area, and the Southeast Al aska Trawl Closure. Since 1987, the North Pacific Fishery Management Council has cl osed 2 areas around Kodiak Island to bottom trawling and scallop dredging because of their designation as important rearing habitat and migratory corridors for juvenile and molting crabs. The closures are intended to assist rebuilding severely depressed Tanner and red king crab stocks. In addition to crab resources, the closed ar eas and areas immediately adjacent to them have rich stocks of groundfish, including fl athead sole, butter sole, Pacific halibut, arrowtooth flounder, Pacific cod, walleye pol lock, and several species of rockfish (NMFS 2005). In 1996 Congress added new habitat provisions to the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the federal law that governs U.S. marine fisheries management. The new provi sions require each fishery management plan to describe and identif y essential fish habitat for the fishery, minimize to the extent practicable the advers e effects of fishing on those habitats, and identify other actions to encourage the conservation and enhancement of those essential habitats (NMFS 2005). An area known as the Sitka Pinn acles, located off Cape Edgecumbe in the Gulf of Alaska, has been closed to all bottomfishi ng and anchoring since 1999 to protect lingcod, rockfish, and corals (NMFS 2005 ). Steller sea lion critical habitat has been defined as 20 nautical mi from 39 r ookeries and 83 haulouts, it also includes 3 foraging areas: Seguam Pass, Bogoslof Island, and Shelikof Stra its. These areas are off limits for commercial fishing. Activities that might affect Alaska's marine waters and submerged lands are regulated by both state and federal agencies . Marine waters and submerged lands that 717 Appendix 5.4, Page 23 are under state jurisdiction extend from the mean high tide line of the state's coastline to 3 nautical mi seaward. Beyond this 3-mi limit, marine waters and habitats are under federal jurisdiction for another 197 nau tical mi, the full exte nt of our nation's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Internati onal law extends the OCS to 200 nautical mi seaward form the coastline, but does not take into account the state/federal boundary. Generally referred to as \"federal waters,\" the federal OCS begins at the state submerged lands line and extend s seaward to the 200-mi legal limit. While coastal states have primary jurisdicti on and control over th e first 3 mi of the EEZ and the federal government has primary jurisdiction over and controls the remaining 197 mi, the Coastal Zone Manage ment Act (CZMA) provides Alaska with substantial authority to influence federal actions beyond 3 nautical mi. The CZMA is the federal legislation that authorized the Alaska's Coastal Management Program (ACMP). DNR is responsible for implementing the CZ MA within state waters and submerged tidelands. DNR develops statewide standards for the ACMP and coordinates individual project review among natural reso urces agencies to facilitate responsible development within Alaska's coastal zone. DEC administers the state's water quality laws. DEC has broad authority to adopt pollution standards and to determine wh at water properties indicate a polluted condition. In addition, DEC establishes marine water quality criteria for 7 aquatic uses: aquaculture; seafood pr ocessing; industry; contact recreation; non-contact recreation; growth and propagation of fish, shellfish, other aquatic life and wildlife; and harvesting for consumption of raw mollusks or other raw aquatic life. Federal authority regarding di scharges to marine waters from marine vessels are regulated by EPA. In addition to DEC and the EPA, the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, know n as MARPOL (for \"marine pollution\"), establishes standards for pr otecting the marine environment from ship pollution. MARPOL regulations are aimed at preventi ng pollution from oil, chemicals, harmful substances in packaged form, sewage and garbage (IMO 2002). The United States Coast Guard (USCG) enforces MARPOL standards and also regulates surface activities on marine wate rs, while both the USCG and the COE are responsible for activiti es affecting navigable waters . Activities pertaining to the marine bed are jurisdictiona l to the U.S. Department of Interior's Minerals Management Service. The USFWS regulates activities regarding marine mammals, and NMFS has authority over activities pertaining to marine fish. One of NMFS's primary responsibilitie s is implementing and enforcing the Magnuson-Stevens Act. The Magnuson-Steven s Fishery Conservation Act is the governing authority for all fishery management activities that occur in federal waters within the United States 200 nautical mi limit, or EEZ. 718 Appendix 5.4, Page 24 The Magnuson-Stevens Act mandates the iden tification of Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) for managed species as well as meas ures to conserve and enhance the habitat necessary for fish to complete their life cycles. Congress has defined EFH as waters and substrate necessary for fish to spaw n, breed, feed, or grow to maturity. The Magnuson-Stevens act requires that federal ag encies consult with NMFS and consider NMFS conservation recommendations for any action they fund, authorize or undertake that may reduce the quality or quantity of designated EFH (NOAA 2001). Marine waters conservation actions that focu s on the protection of habitats and biota, water quality, sound science, partnering, and education and outreach will be most efficient at sustaining Alaska's marine habitats. Conservation recommendations for marine habitats include protecting hab itats from human activities that cause degradation and habitat loss; designing and implementing local and regional projects that sustain natural proce sses; surveying and mapping marine resources and physical characteristics of marine habitats via GIS; and making policy and scientifically based recommendations regarding appropri ate management tools to protect marine habitats. Conservation recommendations for marine biota include making efforts to sustain healthy populations and carrying out actions to protect and restor e species of concern, including mammals, birds, fish, shellfish, and other invertebrates; designing and implementing projects that sustain native marine plant and animal populations and prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species; rebuilding depleted populations of fish species, particularly bottomfish, shellfish and forage fish; and making policy and scientifically base d recommendations about appropriate management tools to sustain species. Protecting Alaska's marine water quality is essential to the sustainability of its aquatic resources. Conservation actions that pr omote maintaining water quality include reducing the input of contaminants, such as toxic substances, to Alaska's marine waters ; promoting management actions to restore areas of degraded water quality; and designing and supporting projects th at will sustain heal thy and functioning marine waters. The continued development and implem entation of sound science to promote understanding of marine waters and habitats are prioriti es for Alaska. Recommended conservation actions toward this end include collecting high quality data and encouraging its use and dissemination th rough the development of protocols for collection, analysis and use of scie ntific data that support Alaska's goals; identifying and striving to fill data gaps that limit protection and restoration efforts; promoting the development of comprehensive, accessible, marine resource databases; promoting the consistent collection and coordination of data to assist the efforts of Alaska and its partners to protect marine habitats and speci es of concern; and circulating scientific information about local marine resources to management agencies, as well as to the public. 719 Appendix 5.4, Page 25 Education and outreach efforts that pr omote stewardship and understanding of Alaska's marine resources are needed to inform th e public about threats to the state's marine resources, and provide practical meas ures to prevent additional impacts. This should include coordinating outreach and education programs with other organizations and monitoring their effectiveness, and engaging the public in active stewardship opportunities thr ough workshops, restoration projects, citizen-science and educational programs. La stly, communication regarding the status of Alaska's habitats and resources to regional policymakers and resource managers and property owners is crucial to acquiring support for pr ograms that help protect marine habitats and its resources.

Fast ice forms annually and may contain icebergs and floes of older pack ice. It can extend for a few meters from a shore, ice front, shoal, or grounded iceberg, or may extend for several hundred kilometers from such attachment points, depending on water depth. Fast ice is generated in the shallow coastal waters of the northern Bering, C hukchi and Beaufort seas. Its formation depends on a combination of air and water temperatures and wind direction over the continental shelf. Sea ice is dynamic and variable with many cracks or openings. Pack ice is not anchored to land and moves with the ocean's currents and winds. It forms annually and can include old sea ice, as well as ice that has formed elsewhere and has floated off with the winds and currents. Under present climatic conditions, pack ice persists in the Arctic Ocean all year. It is extremely heavy and has the effect of dampening sea swells. The rolling motion of the sea can be considerably moderated by a relatively narrow band of pack ice only 100 m or so wide. The result is that where pack ice persists in reasonable quantity, the sea calms down sufficiently for low temperatures to freeze it more easily than moving water. The southern edges of this loose moving ice, called the fringe, ar e subject to dispersal by wind and currents and are broken by the vertical motion of swells from the open sea. Generally, multiyear pack ice in the Arctic has a 3- to 5-year \"life\" expectancy. Walrus on pack ice Lori Quakenbush, ADF&G Due to its movements with ocean currents and wind, pack ice is not continuous; instead pond-like open water re fuges called polynyas and l ong, linear cracks called leads are created. Polynyas are created wh ere winds and currents combine to produce open areas where there is no ice, or compar atively thin ice, during the winter. Some reoccur year after year in the same places, although the exact boundaries vary 721 Appendix 5.5, Page 2 annually with prevailing environmental conditions. Extensive polynyas are found in the Bering Sea. Other open areas, such as leads, are created when weak ice is broken by wind stress, initially forming a crack, and then widened by the wind or currents. The maximum southerly extent of the ice p ack occurs in April, typically extending no farther south than the Pribilof Islands in the Bering Sea. By September, the ice reaches its maximum northward retreat in the Arctic Ocean (Gibson and Shullinger 1988). Ice-associated Species Polar Ecological Role of Sea Ice Habitats Nine species of mammals are strongly and positively linked with the occurrence of sea ice in western and northern Alaska. Thes e are the arctic fox; polar bear; beluga and bowhead whales; the wa lrus; and the bearded, ringed, spotted, and ribbon seals (Burns et al. 1980). Each species of marine mammal requires a certain type of sea ice for resting, molting, socializing, breeding, re aring, migration, and access to prey. Predator-prey interactions within this ma rine ecosystem are dictated by spatial and temporal availability of sea ice. Marine mammals such as the polar bear and seals depend almost entirely on sea ice for their habitat. Among the ice-associated seals, ringed seals occur in all habita ts offered by sea ice, but are the only seal to inhabit the stable land-fast ice along Al aska's northern shorelines . They make and maintain breathing holes through ice that may be 6 ft thick, and the pup s are born in snow caves or lairs excavated in snowdrifts on the ice. Ringed seals do not dive to great depths and make particular use of ice over shallow waters by pr eying on Arctic cod during their nearshore migrati on (Burns et al. 1980). Bearde d seals typically occur in all but the shore-fast ice, while ribbon s eals and spotted seals are generally found only in the ice front from February to late April. Although so me spotted seals occur on the ice fringe, as well as deep into the pack i ce, they are not typica lly found in open seas or consolidated ice in the early spring (Trukhin and Kosygin 1988). Spotted seals take advantage of shorefast ice only when the ice front (10- to 20-m r ectangular floes with brash ice or open water between) has dispersed in late spri ng-early summer or in fall before the ice front forms. Polar bears use the sea ice as a platform from which to hunt ringed and bearded seals. They wait for se als to return to air holes, capturing and pulling them through the ice hole as they come up for air. Alternatively, polar bears will slowly stalk and catch seals as they re st on the ice surface. Without sufficient ice, bears may become stranded onshore, unable to access and succe ssfully hunt their usual prey. 722 Appendix 5.5, Page 3 Many polar bears den offshore on the pack ice of the Beaufort Sea region during November through March, when they give birth and nurse their young (Amstrup 1988). Walrus calves are usually born on the pack ice in late April-early June. The calf subsists solely on milk for the first 6 months or so, before beginning to eat solid foods. Nursing takes place primarily in the water, but also sometimes on land or ice. Sea ice allows seals and walruses to rest ne ar food resources: It provides spacious habitat, is remote from shore-based predators, is relatively sa nitary, and may offer shelter from the wind. The ice edge is also important habitat for birds and marine mammals that are less ice-adapted and cannot feed within the more continuous fast ice zone. These animals are often found feeding and resti ng in leads and divergence zones near the ice edge. Quality and quantity of the ice is an importa nt variable in local habitat selection of ice-dependent species. Seasonal environmenta l change dictates larger scale changes in species abundance and distri bution patterns. For example, migrations of sub-Arctic seabirds (e.g., Thick-billed Murres), water birds, fish, and marine mammals follow the retreating ice northward. The reproductive success and spatial distribution of ice- dependent species also vary between warm and cool environmental conditions. For example, seals and walruses haul out on sea ice to sleep and bear young. Walruses mainly occupy a narrow band of the ice edge in the Chukchi Sea in summer and open water and polynyas throughout the range of s ea ice in the Bering Sea in winter and spring. Leads and polynyas provide migration rout es from summer feeding grounds to wintering areas. Whales, walruses, and certain seals depend on polynyas for winter survival. During this time their presence in ot her areas of the Arctic is restricted for lack of places to breathe due to thick ice cover on the s ea. The survival of animals overwintering in polynyas depends on the wa ter remaining open, in order to minimize energy used to maintain breathing holes. Mi gratory sea ducks such as the federally listed Spectacled Eiders move far offshore to waters during the months of October through March, where they sometimes gather in dense flocks in polynyas located amid nearly continuous sea ice. The presence and condition of sea ice plays a broader and more complex role in the Arctic ecosystem than simply providing a pl atform and transporta tion routes. During the winter, tiny marine ice algae populate th e lower surface of the sea ice. This ice algae is thickest where openings or thi nner ice allow more lig ht penetration. By spring, the algae forms a thin, dense laye r. The algae are the food for an under-ice community of diverse biota. Crustaceans a nd other small sea life feed on these plants, and are in turn, food for fish. Arctic cod are a staple food source for other fish, birds, seals, and beluga whales. Fish species su ch as herring, capelin, eelpout, sand lance, and pollock, as well as octopus and shrimp, ar e significant prey species of arctic seals (Quakenbush 1988). As spring approaches, mo st of the plankton sinks to the sea bottom and supports important benthic communities, including clams, amphipods, worms, snails, sea cucumbers and mollusks, including crab (Gibson and Shullinger 723 Appendix 5.5, Page 4 1998). In turn, these bottom-dwelling populations support large resident marine mammals, such as walruses and bearded seals. Beyond the maximum extent of the pack i ce (i.e., in open water), a bloom of phytoplankton occurs later, followed by a bl oom of zooplankton that graze on these tiny algae plants. The northern Bering a nd southern Chukchi Seas provide dense summer concentrations of zooplankton. Whales such as the bowhead, the only baleen whale with a range restricted to the i cebound seas, thrive on the zooplankton. Other baleen whales, including gray whales, migrat e to this area in the summer and feed on the zooplankton. Effects of diminished sea ice include pot ential changes in the timing, migration routes, and numbers of marine mammals. A change in the status, health, or accessibility of marine mammal populations wi ll affect the human coastal and island communities' subsistence activities, economics, and cultural traditions. Conservation Status Although diminishing in annual depth and extent, Alaska's se a ice habitat is otherwise generally healthy. Localized devel opment will likely continue to result in habitat alteration. Opportunities should be sought that alleviate negative impacts and maintain connectivity, as well as suitable areas of quality habitat important to the sustainability of species. Currently, Arctic sea ice habitats are impacted by global warming, offshore oil and gas development activities, and pollution and contaminant transport. Each of these conservation concerns has associated tr ansboundary, regional and international implications that harbor signi ficant threat to Arctic marine and coastal ecosystems in Alaska. Of great concern fo r Arctic habitats are the ecological implications of reductions in sea ice extent and duration. In 2000 the Arctic Climate Impact Asse ssment (ACIA) study was commissioned via a special initiative of the Arctic Coun cil and the International Arctic Science Committee at a ministerial meeting of the Arctic Council in Point Barrow, Alaska. The purpose of the ACIA was to evalua te and synthesize knowledge on climate variability, climate change, and increased ultraviolet radia tion and associated consequences. Developed by more than 300 in ternational scientis ts, the ACIA report documents a 4-year study on the rapid warm ing of the Arctic. In November 2004, the scientists released a 144-page summary of their findings at a press conference in Washington, D.C. This study reports a drama tic reduction in the extent of the summer ice pack in the Arctic Ocean. Specifically, late summer ice covera ge has declined by as much as 20 percent in the past 3 decades and is projected to shrink by another 10 to 50 percent by the end of this century (Spotts 2004). These findings point to a real loss of sea ice habitat that Arctic marine mammals depend on. For more information on findings of the ACIA report, s ee CWCS Section IVA, pages 83-88. 724 Appendix 5.5, Page 5 International efforts to protect the Ar ctic and its biota are occurring under the auspices of the Arctic Council, an inte rgovernmental forum for addressing common concerns and challenges faced by the Arct ic states of Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and the Russian Federa tion, Sweden, and the United States. Two Arctic Council programs, in particular, focu s on the needs of Arctic marine species; these are the Program for Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF, described in more detail in Section VIII), which prom otes conservation of biodiversity and the sustainable use of living resources, and the Program for the Prot ection of the Arctic Marine Environment (PAME). PAME addr esses policy and nonemergency pollution prevention and control measur es related to the protecti on of the Arctic marine environment from land and sea-based activit ies, including marine shipping, offshore oil and gas development, land-based activit ies, and ocean disposal. Established in 1993, the PAME program works closely with CAFF scientists and also with representatives of the othe r 3 Arctic Council programs: Sustainable Development Working Group (SDWG), which explores the economic, social, and cultural aspects of sustainable development; AMAP, which id entifies pollution risks and their impact on Arctic ecosystems and assesses the eff ectiveness of international agreements on pollution control; and Emergency, Preven tion, Preparedness and Response (EPPR), concerned with sharing information and methods for spill prevention and control. All offshore oil and gas developments re quire a means of bringing hydrocarbons to the international market. With one exception this requires onshore infrastructure. The exception is offshore oil transfer, which is the single biggest source of oil pollution in the Arctic (Smith 2004). To date, fast ice has provided a useful platform on which to construct temporary roads and conduct onshore exploratory seismic and drilling operations. Fast ice used for seismic exploration may impact denning polar bears that construct dens where sufficient snow accumulation provides cover. Additionally, seismic exploration has been documented to alter bowhead whale mi gration routes, as well as to displace ringed seals (Burns et al. 1980). Alaska's Arctic waters have experienced an increase in use by maritime traffic in recent years, and this trend will likely con tinue. Based on current activity levels of oil exploration, production, and tr ansportation, Cook Inlet and the Beaufort Sea are the state's areas of highest con cern regarding protection from oil spills. Unfortunately, there continues to be no si gnificantly effective method fo r containing and cleaning up fuel spills that may occur in icy wate rs (DF Dickins Associates Ltd. 2004). Booms and lenses are ineffective in broken ice a nd unusable in closed ice conditions. State oil spill contingency plans fall short of the ability to protect Alaska's marine environments. This is particularly troubli ng because contaminants remain toxic longer and are more difficult to clean up once trapped in ice. They also take longer to break down in the Arctic's colder temperature regime. An additional concern is that fuel spills concentrate in open waters in the s ea ice and in breathing holes where animals surface and congregate. 725 Appendix 5.5, Page 6 Currently, 30 miles of Arctic Ocean coast line is federally designated as wilderness. This area is known as the Arctic National W ildlife Refuge. It is here, on the coastline of this refuge that more polar bears den than along any other stretch of Alaska's coast. Other important polar bear denning habitat o ccurs within the Western Arctic Reserve (National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska). Marine waters within 3 miles of Alaska's coast are under jurisdiction of the DNR's Division of Mining, Land and Water. Waters beyond the 3-mile limit are managed by the NOAA. The COE regulatory jurisdicti on under the Clean Water Act and the Rivers and Harbors Act also includes all o cean and coastal waters within a zone 3 miles seaward from the line on the shor e reached by the ordinary low tides. Programs that monitor sea ice in Alaska's waters are important. Such programs should receive support in order to allow for regional assessments and integration with other Arctic and global monitoring program s. Research to develop credible and effective response to spilled oil in moving, broken, pack ice in the ocean, lakes, or rivers is also a high priority. These proj ects require consistent, long-term funding to be effective and meaningful. Literature Cited Amstrup, S. 1988. Polar Bear. In: J.W. Lentfe r, editor.

The high soil acidity and damp conditions of temperate rain forests and mu skeg are ideal for creating interconnected dissolved features in alka line calcium carbonate bedrock. This network of caves and tunnels is a distinct habitat type lo cated underground but connected, in varying degrees, to the overlying landscape through si nkholes (also called dolines or collapse pits), cave entrances, and subsurface hydrology. In Alaska, karst landscape is primarily lo cated in the Alexander Archipelago, which includes Prince of Wales, Dall, Coronation, Sumez, Experts group). The mainland near Haines, Ha ines State Forest in Southern Chilkat Valley (Streveler and Brakel 1993), and th e Wrangell-St. Elias Mountains also contain areas of karst. Outside of South east Alaska, the only ot her karst landscapes overlain by temperate rain forest are located in Chile and Tasmania. Other karst areas in Alaska include the Lime Hills on the west side of Cook Inlet, the Jade Mountains in northwest Brooks Range (sinkholes, springs, and underground streams) and the White Mountains in the Interior. The karst cave systems in Southeast Alaska are the most extensively studied; very little is known about th e extent and ecology of Alaska's northern and western karst areas. The following habitat de scriptions address karst cave conditions in Southeast, in the co astal areas of Canada, or generalized cave conditions. Within the karst cave system are severa l zones of differen tial habitat use and characteristics. The \"entrance zone\" is lo cated immediately ar ound the cave or tunnel opening and is the most influenced by surface conditions. The \"twilight zone\" extends from the entrance to mid-depth and is best characterized by decreasing light levels and connectivity to the exterior. The final zone is the \"deep cave\" area, which is almost entirely isolated from exterior conditions. Within and between these zones are a range of characteristics th at affect species distribution: light level; temperature; the size; the cave's depth elevat ion relative to sea level; humidity; substrate type; connectivity to surface water/flow levels; nce; turbidity, pH, conductivity of water; nutrient e system; and thickness of epikarst (Aley and Aley 1997). The one factor th at influences all of these habitat characteristics is the degree of connectivity between the surface and subsurface. In a karst cave system, the speed and magn itude of transfers between surface and subsurface is controlled by sinkholes and hydrol ogic flows (Karst Task Force for Inventory Committ ee 2001; Baichtal 1993). 728 Appendix 5.6, Page 2 Nutrient input to cave systems depends on su rface organics being transported through connections from the surface. These nutrient sources may take the form of debris falling into sinkholes or being washed into cave systems by sinking streams (streams descending through the cave system). Karst cave inhabitants can be obligate, opportunistic, or accidental. Accidental inhabitants are those organisms introduced into the systems through sinkholes or flushed in by water flow. While accidental species rarely survive, they present an important influx of nutrients to the system . Opportunistic use is generally limited to terrestrial or littoral openings, but this us e does represent a wide range of taxonomic groups. Obligate cave inhabitants consist of troglobite (terrestrial cave dwellers) and stygobite (aquatic cave dwellers) invertebrates and bats. The most extensive invertebrate surveys to date were conducted in 1992 and 1995. Collections from over 300 cave and resurgence sites in Southeast yielded at least 5 troglobitic and 40 trogl ophilic invertebrate species (Carlson 1997a). Another extensive survey of cave invertebrates conducted in 1997 on Vancouver Island initially identified 192 taxa. Investig ators in this study found \"remarkable\" similarities between cave fauna compositions on Vancouver Island and in Southeast (Shaw and Davis 2000). Entrance Zone The entrance zone is characterized by lower light levels and higher relative humidity than exterior conditions, and more dram atic temperature variations and higher nutrient availability than in terior areas of caves. Davi s et al. (2000) defined the entrance zone as 0-10 m from the entrance of the caves, but actual entrance zone parameters may exist in varying loca tions depending on cave entrance size. Starlight Cove, Prince of Wales Island T. Heaton, University of South Dakota 729 Appendix 5.6, Page 3 Terrestrial openings are used by various species of bats for swarming and feeding activities. Temporal, gender, and life cycl e differences in cave use relate to the elevation, temperature, variation of temp erature, humidity, and size of the cave. Caves at lower elevations are used by Myotis spp. females and juveniles in late summer months (Davis et al. 2000). Aquatic invertebrate accidentals washed into Vancouver Island cave habitat are mostly from the taxonomic groups Plecopt era, Ephemeroptera, and Trichoptera. Terrestrial beetles and mosquitoes also us e cave entrances. The highest invertebrate diversity occurs in the entrance area, and the composition is dominated by taxa that would likely be found elsewhere in similar surface environments. Near-entrance fauna is dominated by a number of flies and associated predators, such as spiders and weevils (Shaw and Davis 2000). Additional habitat functions of the entrance zone include denning by black and brown bears, river otters, wolves and mustelids, although there is uncertainty about the extent of this use (Streveler and Brakel 1993). Sitka black- tailed deer use the thermal buffering effects of air currents at cave entrances both summer and winter (Baichta l and Swanston 1996). This effect has been called \"cave breath\" and may allow some species or individuals to live at the temperature limits of their di stribution (Streveler a nd Brakel 1993). Both songbirds and seabirds use openings for ne sting and feeding depending on proximity to shore (Baichtal 1995). Entrance Zone-associated Species: Little California, Appendix 5.6, Page 4 Twilight Zone The \"twilight zone\" extends from the en trance to mid-depth; it has sheltering characteristics but is not completely isol ated from the surface. Most invertebrates found in caves reside in the twilight zone . Few true obligate troglobites occur here, but there is large potential for finding as yet undescribed and unidentified species. Other species may have certain portions of their life cycl e that necessitate different zones of the caves. The twilight zone is the area of a cave used by roosting bats (Davis et al. 2000). Twilight Zone-associated Species Little brown bat, Cave Zone The deep-cave zone is a very stable, insulate d habitat, but this st ability is a function of a very narrow range of habitat cond itions. Deep cave invertebrates (hypogean invertebrates) are highly sp ecialized to cave conditions , with extremely limited tolerance for light, humidity, temperature, a nd pH variations, but with the ability to exploit low nutrient and oxygen levels (CWC S Expert Group 2004). The interior of a deep cave generally has little organic debr is, no light, temperatures slightly above freezing, high humidity (100%), a pH near neutral (a consequence of the buffering effects of the dissolved calcium carbonate), and a very limited input of new species, predators, or competitors. One possible example of a hypogean adaptation is amphipod development of reduced metabolic rates compared to their epigean counterparts in response to limited food avai lability or low oxygen conditions (Spicer 1998). In deep-cave habitats, collections of i nvertebrates were dominated by collembola, symphyla and diplura with infrequent (Robustocheles occulta ), or for both stygobites and troglobites, only number of caves (i n a system) was a significant predictor of distribution (Culver et al. 2003) . For example, the more extensive a system, the more cave-adapted species it supports. Myotis spp. use deep cave areas of high elev ation caves (800 m) as hibernacula. These hibernating locations ar e characterized by temperatur es close to freezing, with a small range of temperature variation and high humidity levels (Davis et al. 2000). However, Myotis spp. depend on caves of varying dept hs and locations at different points in the species' lifecycle. 731 Appendix 5.6, The connectivity between karst systems and the overlying landscape also benefits the overlying forest. In Southeast Alaska, kars t areas are better dr ained and have less acidic soil, promoting growth of larger trees than in nonkarst areas. Dissolved fissures in the bedrock allow deep root growth making large trees more windfirm. The underground portions of streams can provide buffers for water pH, water temperature, and flood discharges. For example, acidic water (pH 2.4-5.8) flowing into karst areas may exit the cave system with a pH of 7.5-9.0 (Aley et al. 1993; Baichtal and Swanston 1996). Water with dissolved minerals from contact with a karst system typically has a higher specific conductance than waters from nonkarst systems (Karst Task Force for the Resources Inventory Co mmittee 2001). Compared with other North American karst systems, Southeast karst landscapes in particular have mid-range conductance values and high runoff values, accelerating dissolution and cave formation processes (Aley et al. 1993). These dissolv ed minerals represent an im portant source of calcium and carbon for use in biological systems. On Your Knees Cave inside Bear Pa ssage. Sedimentary la yers and spring. T. Heaton , Universit y of South Dakota 732 Appendix 5.6, Page 6 Ecological Role of Karst Caves Protection of the karst lands cape is important to preserve the state's species biodiversity. The narrow range of interior conditions supports co mmunities of species that are specifically adapted to unique e nvironmental conditions . In addition, these environmental conditions generally occur in isolated pockets that preclude migration of individuals between habitat patches. As a result, obligate cave fauna, especially deep-cave inhabitants, have population characteristics of a species highly susceptible to rapid evolutionary change via endemism (Culver et al. 2003). Locations of invertebrates and bats in Southeast karst caves often represent the northernmost known extent of these speci es' distribution. Prince of Wales Island holds records for north ernmost locations of Stygobromus sp. and the bats M. keenii and M. volans (Baichtal 1996). Bats are particularly vulnerable to huma n disturbance while hibernating. Bats do not store a lot of fat in preparation for hibe rnation (as bears do), and disturbance and rousing of hibernating bats can cause 10-30 days of fat to be metabolized (Brady 1982). Southeast karst caves may be extremel y important to the perpetuation of bats in general in the state of Alaska. Of th e 5 species of bats in the state only one, M. lucifugus, has a range extending nor thward of Southeast. M. lucifugus is widely distributed, with its summer range extending into the Yukon Territory. However, little is known about where the species overwinter s. The Yukon Government theorizes that M. lucifugus migrate to the Alaskan coast to hibernate for the winter. Northern populations of M. lucifugus have larger females than males (southern populations do not have this sexual dimorphism). One suggest ed explanation for this is that juvenile bats must be larger at birth to have su fficient body resources to survive their first winter of hibernation. This may represen t an adaptation unique to northern areas. Karst caves are used as birt hing dens by otters, and resti ng and denning sites for deer, bears, wolves and small mammals. Some bi rd species, includi ng dippers, thrushes, and swallows, are known to use cave en trances for nesting and feeding. Aquatic habitats associated with karst landscapes are more productive than nonkarst aquatic habitats (USFS 1997). Streams flow ing through karst areas support larger coho salmon fry and parr than str eams without Hi gher alkalinities of karst streams are positively correlated with higher fish densities (Bryant 1997). A consideration for preserving biodiversity in karst caves is the potential to discover previously undescribed sp ecies. A 2002 article in Acta carsologica identified the world's most diverse caves as having 41 to 84 species of stygobites and troglobites (Culver and Sket 2002). Meanwhile, a study of cave fauna on Prince of Wales Island preliminarily identified 77 invertebrate taxa even without many samples being identified to the species level (Carlson 1997b). 733 Appendix 5.6, Page 7 Figure 5.2. Graph showing exponential incr ease in the number of known obligate, cave-dwelling species North Americ a (DeKay, 1844; Nicholas, 1960; Packard, 1888; Peck, 1998) and a power functi on trend line fitted to the data. From SUBTERRANEAN BIODIVERSITY PROJECT, Resear ch Proposal Submitted to the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission. A.V. Brown and G.O. Graening, March 6, 2000. Conservation Status Alaska's karst cave habitat is generally healthy. Localized development will likely continue to result in habita t alteration. Opportunities s hould be sought that alleviate negative impacts and maintain connectivity, as well as suitable areas of quality habitat important to the sustainability of species. The conservation of both karst cave habitats and associated species communities is complicated by the limited knowledge of the cave ecology in Alaska. Many unknown or poorly understood variables could impact species survival. Some of these variables include identifying links to the overlying landscape and connecti ons to ground water and surface water systems. Hydrologic system s expand the area of impact and effects far beyond the physical limits of a cave. Habitat assessment can be complicated because karst drainage does not coincide with surface drainage patterns or even watershed or hydrologic unit boundaries (K arst Task Force for the Resources Inventory Committee 2001). Significantly, ka rst formation processes are impacted by both glaciers and permafrost. In Arctic regions, ground water circulation can be impeded by static ice masses (glaciers) that form in caves (Ford 1993). Little study has yet been conducted on the effects of clim ate change and karst cave fauna. To fully conserve karst caves and their resources, th e caves and their karst landscapes must be managed as a whole. Road development, land clearing, timber ha rvest, and mining activ ities all have the potential to alter subsurface water and nutrient flows. Timb er harvest and related road construction in the vicinity of caves in crease runoff and sedimentation, which may 734 Appendix 5.6, Page 8 flood, scour, or fill previously stable cav e environments. Debris accumulates and blocks cave entrances and exits through pract ices of disposing of slash and rerouting of surface flows into sinkhole ponds or dr y sinkhole pits. Recreational users pose another, more direct, risk to cave habita t. A high volume of visitors can destroy terrestrial habitat in cav es by compacting cave sediments (IUCN 1997). Bats are susceptible to human disturba nce; caves can be gated with \"bat friendly\" gates to exclude human disturbance, but these can unintentionally exclude other nonhuman species that depend on, or opportuni stically use, karst caves. Karst caves have high value for paleontological research because fossils preserved in caves create records of species distribution through the last millennia and provide insight into the location and extent of glacial refugia during the last Ice Age. Species distribution may also provide insight into climate conditions when early bands of humans may have migrated through the area (Heaton 2002). There is an ongoing study funded by the National Science Foundation, National Geographic Society, Tongass National Forest, and University of South Dakota to inventory and identify paleontological deposits in caves in the Tongass National Forest. The protection of a karst cave is very much dependent on the ownership of the overlying land. On state and private lands th ere is minimal to no protection. As of January 2005, the State of Alaska Division of Forestry did \"not recognize karst topography as a significant re source to be managed on the State's limited land base in southeast. The DOF will protect karst formations that affect water quality as per the Alaska Forest Resources and Practices Act and Regulations. If significant recreational activity is found to be dependent on a karst resource, it will be taken into account during the development and implementation of the Forest Land Use Plan (FLUP) process for a proposed timber sale (Division of Forestry, Coastal Region).\" In 1992 the state legislature attempted but failed to pass an Alaska State Cave Protection Act. There is a higher level of protection for caves on federally owned lands due to the Federal Cave Resources Protection Act of El Capitan Cave fish fossils; otoliths, vertebrae, spines and jaws dated to the early Holocene T.

Heaton, University of South Dakota 735 Appendix 5.6, Page 9 1988. This act applies to listed \"significan t caves\" on federal lands. The significance is determined by criteria established by th e Secretary of the Interior or his/her delegates. In Alaska, a large amount of th e karst landscape is located on federal lands: Portions of the White Mountains are unde r BLM management; many of the caves in the Alexander Archipelago are in the T ongass National Forest; karst landscape is located in Wrangell-St. Elias National Pa rk and Glacier Bay National Park; and the Lime Hills and the Jade Mountains are bot h located on a mixture of federally owned and Native-owned or -selected lands. The 1997 Tongass Forest Plan Cave St andards and Guidelines (USFS 1997) implemented a karst resources management strategy that included developing an inventory of caves and hydrologic systems and protecting and maintaining significant caves and cave resources to the extent feasible. These guidelines fulfill responsibilities under the Federal Cave Res ources Protection Act. The Forest Service in the Ketchikan area has developed a coope rative effort with the Alaska Cavers Association to inventory and document cav es. The Thorne Bay Ranger District has developed trails and viewi ng platforms and tours for 2 of the larger caves in Southeast. Even within the Tongass Nati onal Forest, different land designations (monuments, wilderness areas, etc.) ma y affect the degree of cave protection (Streveler and Brakel 1993). There are no species-specific legal prot ections for obligate cave inhabitants on nonfederal is on the \"Red List\" of poten tially endangered species in Canada. Many troglobite invertebrates in the Lower 48 states are listed as endangered species due to their high degree of endemism and limited distributions. One of the most important aspects of cons erving karst caves is the preservation of aquatic systems. Currens (2001) documente d changes in ground water flow after applying best management practices for pr otection of a karst aquifer similar to riparian best management practices instituted to protect ground water quality. Sinkholes should be recognized as a direct link to undergr ound streams and vegetated buffer zones required around the sinkhole, as well as surface use restrictions in the immediate drainage area. Ra pid transmission of ground wate r with little filtering through external vegetation and karst make s underground aquatic systems susceptible to pollution inputs (IUCN 1997). Conservation actions that focus on coopera tive working relationships between land managers and speleologists regarding karst cave habitats are an important tool for managing and protecting these areas. Identi fying areas important to maintaining species diversity should continue. Recommended conservation actions for karst caves include the inventory of caves in northern and western Alaska to acquire basic knowledge, su ch as extent, location, and any ecological use. Efforts toward achie ving protected species status for rare, endemic cave fauna, such as the identif ication and descrip tion of Southeast invertebrate species and their associated habitat, should be supported. Research 736 Appendix 5.6, Page 10 regarding the effectiveness of best management practices in karst areas to protect hydrology and prevent introduction of debris and contaminants is critical to sustaining healthy karst cave habitats. In addi tion, investigation of the use of instream flow reservations for ground water and subsurface ownership to protect cave resources should be considered. Fina l recommendations include support for identification of caves, and the establishm ent of guidelines for recreational use through working relationship with Alaska Caver's Association.

Approximately three- fourths of all freshwater resources in Alaska are stored as glacial ice covering about 5% of the state. Alaska has more than 3 million lakes greater than 5 acres (Harle et al. 1993), over 12,000 rivers, thousands of streams and creeks, and an estimated 100,000 glaciers. Alpine glaciers, lakes, groundwater, glacial and clearwater rivers, streams, springs and ice fields connect the uplands to Alaska's estuarine ecosystem. Alaska's largest rivers include the Yukon, Kuskokwim, Susitna, and the Copper. The state's longest river is the Yukon. At over 2000 miles long it is the third longest river in North America. It flows for 1280 miles through Alaska and drains a 204,000- mi 2 area. Alaska's rivers support many aquatic species including both anadromous and resident fish, and serve as migratory corridors to the many smaller tributaries and waterways that support spawning, rearing, and overwintering habitats. These same tributaries provide protective vegetative cover, a significant source of detritus, and terrestrial w ildlife riparian migration corridors. Kashwitna River D. Ryland, ADF&G Lake Iliamna is Alaska's largest lake covering an area of approximately 1000 mi2. It is 75 mi long and 20 mi wide. Other lakes of size include Lake Clark and Becharof, Naknek, Ugashik, Teshekpuk, Tustumena and Kenai lakes. The Wood-Tikchik Lakes system in Southwest Alaska consists of 13 lakes that range in length from 15 to 45 mi. Alaska's freshwater ecosystems are found acr oss the state from the temperate coastal rain forest of the Southeast region with maritime climate and dense riparian vegetation, to the boreal forest of Interi or Alaska, with cont inental climate and modest riparian vegetation, to the Arctic tundra of the North Slope, with sparse 740 Appendix 5.7, Page 2 riparian vegetation (Reynolds 1997). In term s of elevation, fresh water habitats are found from the highest alpine glacier and ci rque lakes down to sea level, and flowing waters effectively connect the mountains to the sea. Alaska freshwater resources are distributed throughout the state, from the mountains to the coastal plain, and they provide a wide variety of habitats. Aquatic habitats are complex and range from small, ephemeral st reams to large, braided glacial systems that flow across entire regions of the state. Still water habitats range from tiny ponds to some of the very large lakes mentioned above. Headwater streams include pool, riffle, side channel, isolated pool and stream margin and backwater habitats. Floodplain characteristics incl ude main channel, side ch annel, oxbow lake, backwater lake, meander, scroll depression, and b ackwater wetlands habitats. Lake and pond habitats include typical shoreline, pelagic and benthic areas. Flow regime The flow regimes of Alaska's rivers and lakes include those influenced by glacial melt, snowmelt, precipitation, and ground water, including springs and upwelling areas. Three common types of streams occur in Alaska: ephemeral, intermittent and perennial streams. Directly correlated w ith precipitation, ephemeral streamflow is limited to short periods of a few hours or da ys immediately after storms and floods. In intermittent streams, flow occurs for several weeks or months each year when precipitation and ground water input is relatively high. Perenn ial streams have a well- defined channel that contains water at le ast 90 percent of the time. They receive substantial ground water input and generall y flow continuously throughout the year. Annual flows can vary widely and str eams may be dry during periods of low precipitation, although ground water is genera lly near the surface. Water supply to Alaska's ponds and lakes is governed by the same types of flow regimes as for these 3 stream types. Substrate and Morphology The type and ratio of substrate materials offered by a waterway determines the habitat suitability for associated aquatic species. This is particularly true for aquatic species during differing life stages. Stream and riverbed substrates vary from large boulders to glacial silt or flour, clay, and mud. Large boulders provide resting areas for fish, while smaller cobbles and gravels allow for the required aeration and subsequent development of eggs buried in the streambed. Larger substrates provide greater surface area for 5.7, Page 3 concentration and for the establishment of algae and mosses. Boulder and cobble bed streams are usually found in the upper portion of a watershed. These streams often have pockets of gravel and fines in the pools, behind large rocks, and on the inside of bends and other areas of reduced velocity. Mud, silt, or clay substrates are often represented in shallower and slower waters, or at the terminus of a waterway. Many other physical factors contribute to the complexity of aquatic habitats, and channel morphology characteristics provide additional habitat diversity for aquatic species. Straight and meandering channels are both common, with extent of meandering largely determined by the stream grad ient and underlying soils. Meandering waterways typically contain deeper areas of swift flow near the eroding outer edge of the meander, and areas of deposition a nd shallower water on the opposite bank. In broad valleys of major rivers, extensive meanders create oxbow lakes in abandoned channels. Braided channels are formed as a result of erosional and depositional processes, and are typical of large glacial rivers. Morphologic complexity, along with substrate material that provides channel roughness, contributes substantially to the habitat quality and quantity of a system for aquatic species. Large boulders, Little Willow Creek D. Ryland, ADF&G Lake and pond habitats also vary with substrate, bathymetry, and shoreline contour. Flow regimes and depth contours are also important influences on nutrient cycling, hydraulic retention time and biological productivity in the relatively still waters of lakes and ponds. As with flowing waters, the origin of a lake basin determines its contour and morphometry. River meanders and abandoned channels M. LaCroix , DNR Microhabitat Differing hydrologic energy dissipation as a result of substrate conditions causes specialized microhabitats to develop in wate rways. For example, riffles form in river and stream reaches where flow is slowed by rocks, gravel, or sand bars. In a healthy system, these features are interspersed with pools of deeper, slower water. Intermediate runs of moderate current are often found in larger streams and rivers. In 742 Appendix 5.7, Page 4 the lower stream reaches, deep pools near undercut banks, and large woody debris are common. The representative biota residing in pool and riffles often contrasts sharply due to differing habitat niches offered by each. In lower elevation areas, backwater sloughs and their associated floodplains a nd wetlands provide some of the most physically protected and biologically produc tive freshwater aquatic habitats. Large woody debris (LWD) is an important component of rivers and streams that helps to stabilize banks and substrate mate rial, and provide cover from terrestrial predators. It also fosters formation of pool habitats and provides spawning bed integrity and habitat for aquatic inverteb rates, elevating in-stream productivity. In large rivers, LWD groundings often lead to formation of downstream islands, bars and slough habitats. In smaller streams, lakes, and ponds, LWD plays an important role in habitat creation immediately adjacent to the point of input. Decaying terrestrial debris also tends to accumulate near LWD, providing a food source for aquatic invertebrates. In Alaska, nutrient input fr om both allochonthous (originating outside the system) and autochonthous (originating within the system) sources contributes significantly to fresh waters, whether flow ing or still (e.g., lake and pond habitats). Cumulatively, stream- or riverbed mate rial, channel morphology, and microhabitat characteristics increase the quantity of ava ilable aquatic habitat and the diversity of the aquatic environment. Similarly, pond and lake habitat are fu rther diversified by the occurrence of differing substrates, depths, and contours. GLACIAL WATERS Glacially influenced rivers and streams The extent to which Alaska is covered w ith glaciers significan tly influences its freshwater habitats. The area of glacier c overage in other stat es is less than 200 mi2, and the glacier ice in the rest of the United States combined totals less than the area of a single large Alaska glacier (Molnia 2001) . In Alaska, glaciers develop in high mountainous areas and often flow out of ice fields that span several peaks or an entire mountain range. Alaska's 300 mi2 Harding Icefield, located in the mountains of the Kenai Peninsula, is the largest in North America and one of only four remaining ice fields in the United States. Thirty-five of Alaska's glac iers, some among the largest mountain glaciers in the world, st em from the Harding Icefield. Glacially influenced waterways are thos e where glacial input is the dominant channel- or floodplain-forming mechanism, dictating the chemical and physical hydrology of the water itself. Glaciers feed a nd influence nearly all major rivers in Alaska and provide the headwaters to some of the state's larges t rivers, including the Copper, Susitna and Tanana. 743 Appendix 5.7, Page 5 Alaska's glacially driven rivers exhibit high and variable rates of fluvial activity and channel adjustments from erosional a nd depositional processes (Wooster 2002). Rivers originating from glaciers tend to have high discharges, and generally have pronounced daily and seasonal st ream flow fluctuations ne ar the glacier and large year-to-year fluctuations in stream flow . Peak glacial river flows occur during the warmest months of the year , typically May through August. However, even during summer, water temperatures are measurab ly lower near a glacier than farther downstream. Glacial rivers tend to transport large volumes of fine-grained sediment and have steep channel slopes. In response to these conditions, braided river channels may develop containing multiple channels separated by bars or islands. During the colder winter temperatures, when base flow is derived entirely from ground water, glacial rivers generally run clear and low. Depending on the channel slope and bed composition, glacial systems may show pronounced accumulation of deposited materials (i.e., aggradation) in their streambeds and valleys. Large, unstable, braided channels occur where the rate of aggr adation is high (e.g., Matanuska glacier/ Matanuska River), and single channels occu r were rates are low (e.g., Mint glacier/ Little Susitna River). Where they are associ ated with rivers, glacier-dominated lakes regulate the flow moving dow nstream and reduce the amount of sediment transported to the river's lower reaches. Glacial waters of the Kenai River with sandbars, islands and side channel habitats Kenai River Center Alaska's glacial hydrologic systems differ fr om clearwater systems in terms of runoff, water quality, and volume. The volume of flow from glacial rivers can be 10 times as much as that from clearwater rivers. Th e water quality difference between these streams is mainly expressed as turbidity: Glacial rivers and streams carry a large sediment load of clay and silt, giving the waters a cloudy-gray opaque color. Other glacially influenced rivers and lake waters appear turquoise blue-green in color. This is due to their absorption of all the co lors of the spectrum except blue, which is reflected off the glacial sediments in the upper reaches of the system. Kenai Lake and 744 Appendix 5.7, Page 6 the upper Kenai River demonstrate this phenomenon. Dissolved oxygen, conductivity, and pH of glaci al versus clearwater systems are roughly equal. Glacial River and Stream-associated Species Rainbow and Ponds Lakes form in glacier-dominated watersheds as a result of glacial advance and subsequent retreat. Most of the state's larger lakes, particularly those in Southwest and Southcentral Alaska, resulted from glaciation and are important to both resident and anadromous fish species for overwintering. Kenai Lake has glacial tributaries, while Iliamna Lake has clearwater tributaries. Both of these lakes are connected to rivers that support large and valuable runs of salmonids. Crescent Lake M. Wiedmer, ADF&G Two types of floods are common in Alaska's glacial waters, yet rarely occur in the rest of the United States. These are floods caused by the release of water from glacier- dammed lakes and by ice jams on rivers. Approximately 750 glacier-dammed lakes have been identified in Alaska. These lake s are formed in areas where glaciers flow across tributary valleys and trap runoff. Catastrophic flooding occurs when the ice dams fail. In some places, the dams fail predictably and/or annually. Others fail unexpectedly due to geomorphic glacial cha nges, with sudden outbursts resulting in floods (Snyder 1993). An ice jam is an accumulation of broken river ice in a narrow, shallow, or blocked part of the river channel. Backwate r pooling from an ice jam can cause flooding upstream. When an ice ja m suddenly releases, river discharge increases rapidly and causes downstream flooding. Glacially Influenced Lake and Pond-associated Species Pygmy whitefish, Prosopium coulteri 745 Appendix 5.7, Page 7 CLEAR WATERS Clearwater Rivers and Streams Clearwater rivers and streams are also common throughout Alaska. In contrast to glacial systems, these waterways exhibit lo w turbidity, high clarity and flow derived primarily from ground water and precipitati on. Clear waters maintain less dynamic annual flows than glacial waters. Clearwater systems have relatively narrower ch annel widths, stable well-defined beds and banks, relatively low sediment loads, and increased habitat complexity in the form of pools, riffles and LWD. Relative to glacial waters, clear waters generally are narrower, as a result, freeze up earlier in the winter months. Overwintering Aquatic overwintering habitats in Alaska are often limited. Many lakes and streams often freeze to the bottom during winter. As the temperatures decrease in the fall, Alaska's freshwater fish usually move from summer habitats to overwintering areas. In winter, fish and other aquatic species may become concentrated in small areas of rivers and at the bottoms of lakes. In clearwater streams, overwintering habitat can be reduced due to the smaller vol ume of water available in contrast to glacial river systems. Often a ri ver's edge or floodplain offers some of the best available overwintering habitat. Upwe lling areas in groundwater-fed streams and perennial spring pools also provi de some of the most important winter habitats for freshwater aquatic species in Alaska. This is particularly true in the Arctic areas where groundwater sources are dominant th roughout the year. Spring-fed streams, deep pools of large rivers, and deeper lakes connected to rivers o ffer additional winter habitats for freshwater aqua tic species in Alaska. Wint er habitat in upper stream reaches is limited to sites of groundwater di scharge or springs; otherwise these areas freeze solid (Reynolds 1997). Katalla River M. LaCroix, DNR In addition to the reduced presence of wa ter in winter months, water quality is an important limiting factor and can further reduce survival success of overwintering fish in an already limite d habitat (Morris 2000). 746 Appendix 5.7, Page 8 Clearwater River and Stream-associated River Endemic Species Trout-perch, Percopsis omiscomaycus 747 Appendix 5.7, Page 9 Clearwater Lakes and Ponds As with flowing waters, the amount and quali ty of available hab itat for biota in and around lakes depends on connections of the la ke with surface and/or ground waters. Lake water level is related to the flow regime and can be perennial, with surface waters present year-round, or intermittent with water present seasonally. Lake level, thermal regime, and chemical composition may fluctuate depending on the groundwater source and connectivity. Clearwater Lake and Rana luteiventris Isolated Lakes and Ponds Many lakes in Alaska are not connected to a ri ver or stream via an inlet or outlet. For example, lakes and ponds of thermokarst, fl uvial, and volcanic origin generally lack connecting tributaries. Isolated or landlocked lakes can also be extremely shallow during the winter. Although landlocked ponds and lakes may app ear to lack connections to surface waters, many \"isolated\" waterbodies are hydr ologically connected to other lakes, wetlands, streams, or rivers by subsurface flows. For example, the state's Arctic region is dotted with shallow ponds and lakes that were created during deglaciation of the area. These ponds are hydr ologically linked via the underlying permafrost. 748 Appendix 5.7, Page 10 Because of their rela tive isolation, lakes and ponds with no surface connection to another water body are more likely to contain unique biota due to temporal isolation. A lake or pond may have either been originally connected to a river or stream, or created during deglaciation with no surface connection to other water bodies. Other lakes, such as isolated oxbow lakes on former floodplains, were once inundated by seasonal river flows but due to changes in river courses may be isolated beyond the active floodplain. Isolated ponds M. LaCroix, DNR RIPARIAN ZONES The riparian zone is the area adjacent to the bank of a water body where terrestrial processes influence the aquatic environment. With few exceptions, mostly related to altitude and/or recent deglaciation, the banks of Alaska's lakes, rivers, and streams are vegetated, and the term riparian zone is most commonly used to refer to the vegetated corridor adjacent to a water body. Riparian zones provide the interface between terrestrial a nd aquatic habitats, and like all \"edge\" habitats, they support a wide diversity of wildlife. In spite of th e large quantity and diversity of aquatic resources in our state, these important habi tats make up only a small percentage of the total landscape. Although the majority of riparian areas in Alaska are in their natural condition, many areas of core develo pment and resource extraction have compromised riparian zones. In 1999 the National Research Council (NRC) developed the following definition of riparian area (NRC 2002). Riparian areas are transitional between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and are distinguished by gradie nts in biophysical conditi ons, ecological processes, and biota. They are areas through which surface and subsurface hydrology connect waterbodies with their adjacent uplands. They include those portions of terrestrial ecosystems that significantly influence exchanges of energy and matter with aquatic ecosystems (i.e., a z one of influence). Riparian areas are adjacent to perennial, intermittent, and ephemeral streams, lakes and estuarine-marine shorelines. 749 Appendix 5.7, Page 11 Riparian zones provide several functions directly related to aquatic habitats. They contribute LWD, provide leaf litter for primary consumer production, filter sediments and pollution, reduce wind, and regulate water temperature through shading and heat retention. They also provide streambank and floodplain integrity and stability via vegetative root systems. Although the functional boundary of a ripa rian area adjacent to a wate rbody varies in relation to local flow regime, elevation, soils and vege tation, the overall importance of riparian zones for fish and wildlife is undisputed. Riparian zone with stream pool, riffl e, waterfall habitat, and LWD in unnamed tributary, Little Susitna River drainage. D. Ryland, ADF&G In Alaska, the distribution and abundance of pl ant species in riparian zones is dictated by geographic location, elevation, and soil characteristics. Generally speaking, emergent vegetation occurs in the hydric (wet) soils along relatively slow-flowing open water of streams or lakes. Shrubs, willows, grasses, and sedges dominate hydric- mesic (wet) soils and seasonally moist mesic (damp, moist) soils where water levels fluctuate. Mesic-xeric (drier) soils in upla nds support species Cliff Swallow, Petrochelidon Appendix Page 12 Ecological Role of Freshwater Aquatic Habitats Alaska's waterways, riparian zones, and their resources sustain large and diverse populations of fish and wildlife. For aquati c species water provides migratory routes, spawning and rearing habitats, overwintering habitat, and refugia. Terrestrial wildlife also derive numerous benefits from fresh water aquatic habitats and riparian areas, including water itself, shelte r, nesting and breeding areas, and important seasonal or aily transportation/mi gration corridors. d Rivers, Streams, Lakes and Ponds The importance of quality fresh water to oblig ate aquatic species, such as fish, is apparent. However, the value of quality microhabitats or niches within the aquatic environment is central to the water's in tegrity, function, and pur pose for other biota as well. For example, niche habitats provided by the streambed substrate and gradient are key in determining the types of orga nisms present and their distribution and abundance. Alaska's resident and anadromous fish us e distinct microhabita ts and often move between them with regular periodicit y. This movement can occur seasonally, annually, or be associated with different life stages. For example, depending on species and life stage, fish use different habitats as juve niles (i.e., for rearing) than they do as adults for spawning (Schlosser 1991). Shifts in use can also be related to water temperature, water level and photoperi od. As temperatures decrease in the fall, for example, Alaska's freshwater fish usually move from summer habitats to overwintering areas offering different habitats. The size and stability of bed material usua lly dictates the presence or absence of benthic invertebrate communities. For exam ple, boulder, cobble, and gravel beds support a high diversity of benthic organisms. In streams, aquatic invertebrates drift downstream with the current. Most of thes e drifting organisms are immature aquatic stages of insects that later metamorphose into winged terrestria l adults, the main groups being mayflies, stoneflies, caddisflies, and midges. Immature mayflies spend from a few months to several years in st reams before they metamorphose and emerge as terrestrial adult insects. During a brief few days the adults mate in swarms near the stream, lay eggs in the water, and die (Stolz et al. 1991). Many of the small invertebrates found in la kes and ponds differ from those found in streams. Aquatic insects or benthic invertebrates that liv e in the bottom sediments or on aquatic plants are the do minant species in lakes and ponds, and they provide a main food source for fish. Cladocera (\"wate r fleas\") are the dominant plankton found in freshwater habitats and are also an important food source for fish and predatory insects. Cobble and gravel substrate provides spawning habitat for fi sh species that construct redds and for broadcast spawners as well. Fish species foraging in cobble-boulder substrates either use isolated pockets of gravel for spawning, or they spawn in tributaries or reaches that have spawning gravels. Redd-building females generally select a site at the tail-o ut of a pool or head of a riffle area where there is good 751 Appendix 5.7, Page 13 circulation of oxygenated water through gravel substrate. Po ckets of relatively stable gravels help protect the redds from the scouring effect s of high flows. Upon their emergence from the gravel, juveniles may m ove into the boulder-cobble reaches to seek refuge. Large woody debris and boulde rs provide streambank structure that decreases sediment input to redds, and o ffer additional refugi a for juveniles and smaller species. Sand and gravel bars and secondary channels provide additional specialized habitats to the aquatic environment. Anadromous species such as eulachon, ra inbow smelt, and longfin smelt exhibit a somewhat unique developmental egg stage wh ereby the female's recently released eggs fall to the stream bottom and immediat ely adhere to the substrate. The outer cover of the egg subsequently ruptures and tu rns inside out, formi ng a short stalk that holds the egg fast to the bottom substrate. These smelt species prefer spawning in substrate composed of coarse sand and gr avel. In addition to spawning in stream habitats, rainbow smelt are also known to spawn in the shallows of lakeshores. Lamprey species depend on muddy bottoms, backwaters, and low gradient areas during juvenile life stages. Substrate material is particularly important in the life cycle of juvenile lamprey as they stay burro wed in the mud for 4-6 years, moving only rarely to new areas. Larval lamprey occupy a special niche in the stream system, filtering microscopic plants and animals from mud on the bottom. However, adult lamprey spawn in gravelly substrates, similar to those required by Pacific salmon. Because lamprey species exhibit freshwater, anad romous and marine forms, they are important forage fish for marine ma mmals, birds, and freshwater fish. Alaskan blackfish prefer muddy substrates in quiet waters in densely vegetated areas of wetlands, ponds, rivers, and lakes. They are spring spawners whose eggs are demersal and stick to available vegeta tion. Blackfish have a unique modified esophagus capable of gas absorption, which a llows them to breathe air. This ability enables them to live in small, stagnant t undra pools that are almost devoid of oxygen in summer and to survive in moist tundra mosses during extended dry periods. The trout-perch ( Percopsis omiscomaycus), Alaska's sole percopsid the mainstem of the state's longe st waterway, the Yukon River. Trout-perch typically reside in deep la kes or in long deep pools of streams and are an important forage fish for larger species. They move into shallower waters to spawn where their eggs sink and stick to substrat e, woody debris, or vegetation. Sticklebacks often dominate lower elevati on ponds, lakes, and streams in Alaska. They are an important forage fish for othe r fish species and for piscivorous birds, such as loons, terns, and gulls. Besides other zooplankton and insects, cladocera are an important food source of stickleback. S tickleback are represented by freshwater, anadromous, and marine forms, the ninespine stickleback being a freshwater inhabitant while the threespi ne stickleback is found in both marine and fresh waters. The presence of aquatic vegetation plays an im portant role in this fish's selection of spawning habitat because the male builds a nest of sand and vegetation to house the 752 Appendix 5.7, Page 14 fertilized eggs. Freshwater stickleback spawn in sha llow well-oxygenated waters, including isolated ponds. Most isolated ponds and lakes provide th e same functions as ponds with hydrologic connectiv ity to other waters, i.e ., providing breeding grounds for aquatic insects, invertebrates, amphibian s, and waterfowl. However, they restrict fish passage and limit distribution, setting the stage for population endemism due to geographic isolation. Because of this, many populations of stickleback in the Cook Inlet area are considered to be different subpopulations that have evolved over time. Invertebrate species, includi ng bivalve mollusks, are ofte n associated with ponds and lakes, whether isoloated or not. The western floater and th e Yukon floater, 2 types of mollusks, are associated with sand and grav el substrates of lakes, ponds, and slow- moving streams. Another invertebrate speci es of concern, the western pearlshell, prefers gravel substrates in rivers. Many avian species overwinter in other areas of the country or in other habitats within the state, yet sp end their summers in ponds and lakes across Alaska. Loons, grebes, waterfowl, and shorebirds are all found throughout lake and pond habitats during the summer mating, ne sting, and rearing season. Although loons spend their winters offshore, they spend summers in land in close proximity to the ponds and lakes where they nest and rear their young. In summer, wa terbirds such as grebes prefer secluded habitats in ponds and la kes. During winter and on their migration journeys grebes prefer large la kes, coastal bays, and estuaries. Many gulls and terns nest in the coniferous tree tops surro unding isolated ponds, eati ng insects and forage fish. Summer breeding areas for Aleutian Terns, however, include the matted dry grass near riverine habitat. Bl ack Scoters and Surf Scoters ne st in the riparian zone of lakes, ponds, or rivers in tundra or forest s, while the White-wi nged Scoter prefers breeding grounds near streams and lakes. Glacial Systems Glacial rivers are important migratory corridors for both aquatic and terrestrial wildlife. They provide access to the clearwater systems elsewhere in a drainage that are ideal for spawning and rearing. In addition, many glacial river drainages contain associated large lake systems. Mainstem spawning does occur in some glacial rivers in Alaska. Onset of migratory movements in fish is induced by water temperature and level. Consequently, migratory and spawning timing in glacial waters can be significantly impacted in years of high glacial melt and can result in flooding and destruction of spawning beds. Regulated primarily by ground water, clearwater syst ems exhibit less dynamic annual flows. Glacially influenced and clearwater lakes Alaska USGS 753 Appendix 5.7, Page 15 Significant eulachon runs are associated w ith some of Alaska's glacial rivers, including the 20 Mile River in the Turnagai n Arm area, the Susitna River, the Kenai River on the Kenai Peninsula, and the Eyak River in the Copper River Delta of Prince William Sound. Pygmy whitefish are generally associated with postglacial lakes and are largely considered a glacial relict species. Streams they inhabit are of moderate to swift current and may be silty or clear. Pygmy whitefish are frequently found in deep, unproductive lake waters. Glacial advances formed 2 large glacial lakes within the Kenai River watershed, Kenai and Skilak Lakes. These lakes provide important overwintering habitat for aquatic species and improve downstream habitats by trapping coarse sediment, increasing water temperatures, and regulat ing downstream flow (Dorava 1998). These lakes significantly influence the downs tream habitats of the watershed. Riparian Zone The riparian zone adjacent to rivers, streams, lakes, and ponds plays a critical role in nutrient cycling between terres trial and aquatic habitats. Nutrient and organic-matter input from the riparian zone has a direct influence on food availability and growth rates of fish in both upstream and floodplai n habitats (Schlosser 1991). The influence of the riparian zone vegetation is greater in headwater streams due to the high ratio of shoreline to stream bottom area. Riparian vegetation along rivers, streams, and lakes is a critical food source to primary producers, such as invertebrates, including filter feeders, shredders, scrapers, and predators. Riparian vegetation provides shade that limits in-water plant growth, but it provides su bstantial organic inputs, such as leaves, needles, twigs, nuts, and flowers. This d ead plant material is the dominant detritus that constitutes up to 90 percent of the organic matter supporting headwater stream communities (Cummins et al. 1978), includi ng insect larvae, such as caddisflies, stoneflies, mayflies and black flies. It also provides s ubstrates for emerging adult insects, such as stoneflies and mayflies. The riparian zone influences fish hab itat by regulating water temperature through shading effects, by providing inputs of food supply and large woody debris, by providing channel structure through mainta ining bank stability, and by preventing sedimentation and erosion (NRCC 2002). Ripa rian zone variables, such as width, density of vegetation, and season, regulate inputs and effectiveness. For example, diversity and density of aqua tic invertebrates available as fish food is higher in streams (Newbold et al. 1980) and lakes (Chris tiansen et al. 1996) with wider riparian zones. In upstream habitats, seasonal varia tions exist related to detritus input in the fall, leaf processing in the winter and spring, and reduced organic inputs during the summer. Similarly, the growth rate of fish in large river floodplain habitats is linked to food availability provided by headwa ters associated with seasonal water fluctuations. The varied structural integrit y and diversity of plant spec ies present in the riparian zone also provide habitat for other wildlife. Amphibians, such as the Wood Frog and 754 Appendix 5.7, Page 16 the Columbia Spotted Frog, require water to complete their life cy cles and are closely linked to riparian areas y ear-round. Wood Frog eggs are fou nd either free floating or attached to vegetation in shallow areas of ponds, lakes, and/or slow-moving streams. Juveniles disperse to surrounding uplands but return annually at adulthood to these aquatic breeding areas. The Northwestern Salamander lives under logs and rocks of the coastal forests next to freshwater ponds or lakes. Its eggs are found attached to vegetation or submerged trees in slow -moving streams, ponds, or lakes. Rough- skinned Newts are found in the coastal fore st around permanent ponds and lakes or in slow-moving streams with large amounts of vegetation. They attach their eggs to vegetation or between pieces of vegetation, making them difficult to spot. Both the Rough-skinned Newt and the Northwestern Salamander have extended periods of metamorphosis within the aquatic envir onment taking approximately 2 years. Small terrestrial rodents such as the Gl acier Bay water shrew and Keen's mouse preferentially use riparian zones. Sma ll mammals may be year-round residents of riparian floodplain forest (Hanley 1999). Wa ter shrews can dive to the bottom of a water body. Air trapped in the small mammal' s fur pops it to the water's surface like a cork. This trapped air also allows the water shrew to float on the surface. Water shrews eat mayfly and caddisfly nymphs, as well as terrestrial invertebrates (National Wildlife Federation 2003). In addition to providing food resources, riparian vegetation provides shrews with cover from predators, while providing easy access to water. Riparian vegetation also provides feeding, br eeding, and nesting area s for all types of birds. Many of the nation's migratory birds depend on riparian areas of lakes, ponds, rivers, and streams to supply food resources su ch as insects, nuts, and berries, as well as protective sites and materials for nesting. Bird density, species richness, biodiversity, number of rare species, and number of breed ing pairs are often elevated within riparian habitat. Large terrestrial mammals also benefit from intact riparian zones by using them as protected corridors for daily or seasonal move ments, and as a means to facilitate gene flow (seek out mates in new areas). The riparian zone provides connectivity to the multitude of hab itat types required to maintain species productivity, sustainabil ity, and biodiversity. As a whole, the riparian zone typically becomes wider as one moves from a water body's headwaters to the floodplain. The width of the riparian zone may be the most important feature for species dynamics, with connectivity, si nuosity, and network patte rn also playing a role (Malanson 1993). Mammals that search th e waters for fish often bring their catch inland to consume. Leftover carcasses decomp ose and feed terrestrial plants that are the mainstay of the riparian habitat, pr oviding shade, sediment filtration, and woody debris. Fallen leaves and large woody debris enter the waters, providing both food for primary producers and enhancing fish spaw ning habitat. Spawned-out fish carcasses provide food sources for juvenile fish a nd for scavenging birds and mammals. These 755 Appendix 5.7, Page 17 activities provide inputs to the aquatic sy stem that contribute to its health and maintain its cyclic nature. Conservation Status Alaska's freshwater habitat is generally healthy. Localized development impacts will likely continue to result in habitat alteration. Opportuni ties should be sought that alleviate negative impacts and maintain conne ctivity and quality ha bitat important to the sustainability of species. Threats to freshwater habitat include point and nonpoint source pollution, development and associated sediment eros ion and removal of riparian vegetation, blockages, diversions, channelization, dams, unmonitored water withdrawals, natural resources extraction, mixing zones, ice expor t, invasive species, and global warming. Regulatory responsibilities over fresh waters in Alaska i nvolve both state and federal agencies. DNR is the state agency respons ible for water data collection and for planning and administering the appropriation of water. The Wate r Resources Section of DNR's Division of Mini ng, Land, and Water regulates water withdrawals and adjudicates water right applications. As th e state's land manager, DNR holds land and water under the public trust doctrine and is responsible for maintaining these resources in an unimpaired state for the us e of future generations. Alaska's laws guarantee the public's access to and use of state waters. Water withdrawals may also be jurisd ictional to DNR's Office of Habitat Management and Permitting (OHMP), which regulates activities that result in the physical alteration of, or have the pote ntial to adversely affect, anadromous waterbodies. The OHMP also regulates activitie s in resident fish streams that might block fish passage. The OHMP holds the state's regulatory authority over anadromous and resident fish and aquatic insect streams. Effective May 1, 2003, fish habitat permitting, Forest Resource and Practices Act review, and other project review functions were transferred from the Habitat and Restor ation Division of ADF&G to the Alaska Department of Natural Resources' OHM P. Specifically, the OHMP's statutory responsibilities are to protect freshwat er anadromous fish habitat under the Anadromous Fish Act (AS 41.14.870) and to provide free passage of anadromous and resident fish in fres hwater bodies (AS 41.14.840). ADF&G regulates activities within the stat e's refuges, critical habitat areas, and sanctuaries. ADF&G also reviews proposed water withdrawals and appropriations, and works to determine appropriate instream flow reservations important to aquatic and riparian habitat functions. In ad dition, ADF&G also reviews projects under federal jurisdiction requiring a Federa l Energy Regulatory License (FERC) for protection of fisheries resources. OHMP and ADF&G's Sport Fish Division work jointly to produce the State's Anadromous Waters Catalog. 756 Appendix 5.7, Page 18 DEC implements the State's Water Quality Standards and programs to address both point source discharges and nonpoint source pollution. Under section 401 of the Clean Water Act, the DEC also issues certifications for activities authorized by the COE. The COE regulates structures in na vigable waters and the placement of fill within waters of the United States. In addition to DEC's programs, most point source discharges to surface waters are also regulated by the EPA, which admi nisters the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program. The state is currently seeking to receive primacy in the administration of this program to the federal government. Activities within the state's designated Coas tal Zone that require state or federal authorizations are reviewed by state agencies for consistency with the standards of the Alaska Coastal Management Program (ACMP). The state's ACMP standard for hab itats, 11 AAC 112.300, requires that rivers, streams, and lakes shall be managed to avoid, minimize, or mitigate significant adverse impacts to: (A) natu ral water flow, (B) active floodplains, and (C) natural vegetation within riparian management areas. According to the definitions found in 11 AAC 112.300, a riparian management area means: (A) along the braided portions of rivers and streams, 500 feet on either side of the waterbody; (B) for split channel porti ons of rivers and streams, 200 feet on either side of the waterbody; (C) for single channel portions of rivers and streams, 100 feet on either side of the waterbody; (D) for lakes 100 feet of the waterbod y; distances in this paragraph are measured from the outermost extent of the ordinary high water mark. This definition applies to water bodies locate d within the state's coastal zone, but the state does not have a legal definition of ripa rian zone that is consistently applied statewide. The Forest Practices Act, im plemented by DNR, requires riparian buffers of varying size depending on land ownership and region of timber harvest. The definition of riparian zone developed by the NRC, referenced earli er in this appendix, is not a definition that is consistently applied by federal agencies. This hinders the ability of state and federal programs to be st protect riparian areas. Alaska has a unique opportunity to study and protect rive r corridors uninterr upted over the whole of the river continuum from headwaters to mouth. Specific recommended conserva tion actions for freshwater aquatic habitats include developing and integrating biodiversity c onservation and sustai nable use objectives into water and land use and natural resour ce use management plans. The conservation and management of existing freshwater ecos ystems should be a priority. Maintaining aquatic systems and natural hydrologic functio ns is preferred over the need for costly 757 Appendix 5.7, Page 19 restoration through engineered solutions. Fo r example, specific conservation actions directed at maintaining hydrological regi mes that sustain suitable spawning and rearing habitats for aquatic species in quality and quantit y are in the state's best interests. Government agencies with wate r rights jurisdiction s hould strive to set minimum flow rates and levels for streams a nd lakes that maintain ecologically viable aquatic systems, including wetlands. Recent GIS capability of the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) will facili tate water management and aquatic conservation goals. The NHD is a comprehensiv e set of digital, spatial data that contains information about surface water f eatures, such as lakes, ponds, streams, rivers, springs, and wells. The NHD allows analysis and display of these water- related data in upstream a nd downstream order (USGS 2005). In Alaska, the USGS topographic maps were used to develop the NHD dataset at a scale of 1:63,360. Hydrologic processes regulate th e quality and quantity of available habitat for aquatic species. Understanding these processes w ithin a given system may help identify critical habitats necessary for overwinte ring and egg survival success of obligate aquatic species. Tools such as an appropr iate aquatic habitat classification and GIS mapping would enhance efforts to iden tify and conserve important areas. Additional recommended conservation actions include studies direct ed at identifying links between landscape proce sses, such as geological and climatic history; the habitat process, such as the development and dynamics of riparian areas and their vegetation; and the ecology and population dyna mics of the dominant fish species that occur in the different ecoregions of Al aska. This will further our understanding of how human-induced changes affect the species composition and population dynamics of each species. Other steps toward conservation include land planning and platting e fforts that protect riparian areas adjacent to important aquatic habitats. Implementation of conservation efforts should focus initially on core areas of development around the state, such as in Fairbanks, Anchorage, and the Matanuska -Susitna Borough. Effective incentives to minimize habitat fragmentation, encroachme nt, and pollution to aquatic ecosystems, as well as establishing long-term cost recovery mechanisms and financial assistance for sustainable use, should be implem ented. Incentive-based approaches that encourage private landowners to protect Alaska's water and riparian areas and provide for their sustainable use should be developed. These may include resources such as farm bills, cost-share programs, tax incentives, conservation easements, and restoration programs. Although these types of approaches are costly, they are also cost effective; it is much cheaper to protect and sustain than to restore. Continued cooperating efforts among stat e and federal agencies, NGOs, and local watershed groups on existing water resources programs that protect water quality through incorporating point and nonpoint source polluti on prevention strategies should be encouraged and st rengthened. These same groups should develop and/or improve mitigation policies that address nega tive impacts to aquatic resources with the goal of maintaining connectivity and productivity of habitats. 758 Appendix 5.7, Page 20 Lastly, cooperative relationships with local watershed and citizen monitoring groups, including outreach and edu cation opportunities, should be fostered. This should include long-term projects a nd long-term partnerships w ith local communities. Grass- roots efforts have great potential to improve the quality of local freshwater habitats by advocating awareness and enlisting volunteers. Literature Cited Christensen, N.L., A.M. Bartuska, J.H.

Public Comment Summary - 2003 and 2005 Results of 2005 Public Review ADF&G conducted a 60-day public review period for the draft CWCS that ended on April 18, 2005. The overwhelming majority of more than 100 comments received from the public, other agencies, and organizations supported the draft CWCS and the importance of working toward the goal of c onserving all of Alaska's wildlife and fish. Commenters included members of the public and the academic community, consultants, borough, state and federal agencies, tribal gr oups, a mining association, local Fish and Game Advisory Committee members, as well as hunting and conservation organizations. During the CWCS planning effort, ADF&G ho sted a website that served as the principal means for sharing information with the public about the draft strategy. During the public review peri od, the draft strategy could be viewed or downloaded from the website at http://www.sf.adfg.state.ak.us/statewide/ngplan/ . Many people used the online comment form to submit input. Over 1600 unique visitors accessed the CWCS website during the public review period, making over 3600 visits. ADF&G also hosted an intranet CWCS we bsite that could be accessed only by ADF&G staff. Public comments arrived by email, fax, and sometimes as multi-page letters. Suggestions for changes ranged from minor ed its to major rewrites or reorganization of the Strategy's chapters. Some commenter s brought up important issues, such as if or how \"game\" species could be addressed, and whether or not habitat should be the focus of the Strategy. Due to the length of the draft strategy and the volumes of material included in its appendices, most reviewers were not expected to fully evaluate the entire document, and some of the submitted comments raised issues or made points that were clearly addressed or covered elsewhere in the draft. At other times, commenters made valuable suggestions about both the style and content of the Strategy, and the planning team incorporat ed such changes in the final CWCS. A few commenters suggested the draft stra tegy should take more of an ecosystem- level approach toward the conservation of species. ADF&G revised the Strategy to include more mention of the value of ecosy stem concepts in species conservation and management. We added an internet link to the Ecological Society of America's site, as well as numerous links to sites descri bing ecosystem-level work going on in, or otherwise of benefit to, Alaska. While the Strategy's conservation action plans (Appendix 4) continue to be primarily sp ecies-based, ecosystem considerations are presented throughout the final Strategy and are anticipated to play an important role during its implementation. Several people suggested the CWCS focus more on the habitats needed by species, instead of directly on the species themselves, as a means to ensure sustainable wildlife and fish populations. Even though the emphasis remains on species, 761 Appendix 6, Page 2 ecosystem and habitat information and relate d considerations are included as part of the final Strategy. Some commenters suggested ad ding one or more game species or populations to the Strategy's featured species list. Another commenter requested that the Strategy be rewritten to address only nongame species. The final CWCS includes a very limited number of game populations that experts identified as being of conservation concern, using criteria developed during the planning process. Although hundreds of specific conservation actions presented in the Strategy are aimed at addressing the conservation needs of species that are not commercially or recreationally hunted, trapped, or fished, many activities will also benefit species harvested in these ways. In response to several commenters, we added language highlighting the economic value of Alaska's species, both for wildli fe-related tourism and as foundations of food chains supporting commercially or recreati onally valuable species. We also added a brief description of ADF&G 's existing nongame and marine mammal programs, and text about the role of en forcement in conservation. A couple of commenters expressed concern th at there appeared to be a lack of involvement by representatives of the hunti ng community, and this lack could weaken the overall Strategy. The outreach effort for this project from the beginning was open and inclusive. ADF&G developed and used a contact list of about 600 names or organizations that included the Alas ka Outdoor Council, Alaska Bowhunters Association, Alaska Flyfishers, Ducks Un limited, Trout Unlimited, and the nearly 80 local ADF&G Fish and Game Advisory Committees spread across the state. Literally hundreds of other suggestions for improving the draft were incorporated into the Strategy\u2014far too many to include in this general summary about public input. The general and very detailed input submitte d by the various reviewers contributed to a greatly improved final Strategy.

Nominee Species List This list of species nominated for considerati on as potential planning ta rgets was derived from various conservation plans, lists, and organizatio ns, as well as expert and public comments. For the purposes of developing a Comprehensive W ildlife Conservation Strategy for the State of Alaska, we consider this list to represent our species of greatest conservation need. We will consider adding and deleting sp ecies as plans and lists of other organizations are updated.

Green List species are those w ith scoring sums (i.e., Population Trend + Population Size + Maximum Threat score [breeding or nonbreeding) + Maximum Distribution score (breeding or nonbreeding]) > 14, or those with a sum of 13 with a Trend score of 5. Details of scoring can be found in the Species Assessment Handbook by Arvi nd Panjabi, located on the Rocky Mountain Bird Observatory web site ( http://www.rmbo.org/ ) Across-the-board high scores put birds in the highest concern category. High trend and threat scores with low size and distribut ion scores put birds into the widespread but vulnerable list, while the opposite, high size and di stribution and low (or unknown) tr end and threats, constitute the third category. The \"rules\" that govern what is or is not \"high\" are not set in stone, but were open to interpretation by knowledge able ornithologists.

AI = Area importance; scores ar e based on knowledge of distribu tions, expert opinion, and data on distributions for species where they are ava ilable. Species are ranked on a relative scale within each Bird Conservation Region. The regional prioritization system uses the same criteria 766 Appendix 7, Page 3 as for national priorities, with the additional rule that species can be assigned to a different category based on their area importance within th e region. Species that ar e highly imperiled are included wherever they occur. BC.

Convention on Internationa l Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (as of July 2002) Protection Status: Value assigned to th e species from the Protective Appendix according to the Convention on International Tr ade in Endangerment of Species (CITES). Values include: A1 = Appendix I (species that are most endangered, thre atened with extinction, and for which commercial international trade is generally prohibited), A2 = Appendix II (species that are not necessarily threatened with extinction at this time, but that may become threatened unless commercial international trade is controlled), A3 = Appendix III (species included by request of a country that regulates its trade, and for which cooperation of other countries is needed to prevent exploitation). COSEWIC. Committee on th e Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (as of November 2002) (for definitions, see www.cosewic.gc.ca/ eng/sct0/Assessment_process_tbl2_e.cfm) XT - extirpated; a species no longer existi ng in the wild in Canada, but occurring elsewhere E - endangered; a species facing imminent extirpation or extinction 767 Appendix 7, Page 4 T - threatened; a species likely to become endangered if limiting factors are not reversed SC - special concern; a species that is se nsitive to human activity or natural events NAR -not at risk DD - data deficient C - candidate; a species that is suspecte d of being in some COSEWIC category of risk of extinction or extirpation at the national level, before be ing examined through the status assessment process PS - partial status (applies onl y to portion of species' range) GRANK. NatureServe, a network of natural heritage programs, and The Nature Conservancy (as of November 2001) Global Status (throughout its range) GX - presumed extinct - not located desp ite intensive searches and virtually no likelihood of rediscovery GH - possibly extinct - missing; known from only historical occurrences but still some hope of rediscovery G1 - critically imperiled - at very high risk of extinction due to extreme rarity (often 5 or fewer populations), very steep declines, or other factors G2 - imperiled - at high risk of extincti on due to very restri cted range, very few populations (often 20 or fewer), st eep declines, or other factors G3 - vulnerable - at moderate risk of extin ction due to a restrict ed range, relatively few populations (often 80 or fewer), recent and widespread declines, or other factors G4 - apparently secure - uncommon but not rare; some cause for long-term concern due to declines or other factors G5 - secure - common; widespread and abundant GNR - unranked - global rank not yet assessed GU - unrankable - currently unrankable due to lack of information or due to substantially conflicting information about status or trends. Whenever possible, the most likely rank is assigned and the question mark qualifier is added (e.g., G2?) to express uncertainty, or a range rank (e.g., G2G3) is used to delin eate the limits (range ) of uncertainty. G#G# - range rank - A numeric range rank (e .g., G2G3) is used to indicate the range of uncertainty in the status of a species or community. Ranges cannot skip more than one rank (e.g., GU should be used rather than G1G4). G#? - inexact numeric rank\u2014denotes inexact - questionable taxonomy - taxonomic dist inctiveness of this entity at the current level is questionable; resolution of this uncertainty may result in change from a species to a subspecies or hybrid, or the inclusion of this taxon in another taxon, with the resulting taxon having a lower-priority conservation priority G#T# - infraspecific taxon (trinomial) - The status of infraspecifi c taxa (subspecies or varieties) are indicated by a \"T-rank\" followi ng the species' global rank. Rules for assigning T- ranks follow the same principles outlined above for global conservation status ranks. For example, the global rank of a critically imperile d subspecies of an otherwise widespread and common species would be G5T1. A T-rank cannot imply the subspecies or variety is more abundant than the species as a whole-for exampl e, a G1T2 cannot occur. A vertebrate animal population, such as those listed as distinct population segments under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, may be considered an infraspecifi c taxon and assigned a T-rank; in such cases a Q 768 Appendix 7, Page 5 is used after the T-rank to denote the taxon's info rmal taxonomic status. At this time, the T rank is not used for ecological communities. IUCN. International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (as of 2002) IUCN Conservation Status: EX = extinct, EW = extinct in wild, CE = critically endangered, E = endangered, VU = vulnerable, LR = lower risk, DD = data deficient, NE = not evaluated, CD = conservation dependent, NT = n ear threatened, LC = le ast concern. According to the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria, Version 3.1 (found at http://www.iucn.org/themes/ssc /redlists/RLcats2001booklet.html ), a taxon is Critically Endangered \"when the best available evidence indicat es that it meets any of the criteria A to E for Critically Endangered (see Section V), and it is therefore considered to be facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild.\" Similarly a taxon is Endangered \"when the best available evidence indicates that it meets any of the criteria A to E for Endangered (see Section V), and it is therefore considered to be facing a very high risk of extinction in the wild. A taxon is Near Threatened when it has been evaluate d against the criteria but does not qualify for Critically Endangered, Endangered or Vulnerable now, but is close to qualifying for, or is likely to qualify for, a threatened cat egory in the near future.\" NAWCP. Waterbird Conservation for the Am ericas: The North American Waterbird Conservation Plan, Version 1 (2002). Highly Imperiled - This includes all speci es with significant popul ation declines and either low populations or some other high risk factor. Species are identif ied as Highly Imperiled using the following criteria: PT = 5 and either PS, TB, TN, or BD = 5. High Concern - Species that are not Highl y Imperiled. Populations of these species are known or thought to be declining, and have some other known or pot ential threat as well. Species are identified as of High Concern using the following criter ia: PT = 4 or 5 and either PS, TB, TN, or BD = 4 or 5; or PS = 4 or 5 and either TB or TN = 4 or 5 PT = Population trend. 4 = apparent popul ation decline; 5 = biologically significant population decline. PS = Population size. 4 = 480-5800 individu als; 5 = up to 480 individuals. TB = Threats to Breeding. 4 = Significant potential threats exist, but have not actually occurred; concentration not a risk; 5 = Known threats are act ually occurring and can be documented; concentration re sults in actual risk. TN = Threats to Nonbreeding. This factor rates the threats know to exist for each species during their nonbreeding season. The scores are the same as for the Threats to Breeding factor, but without the additional risk due to concentration during breeding. BD = Breeding Distribution. 4 = local (450,000 km 2 - 1,500,000 km2); 5 = highly restricted (up to 450,000 km2) NOAA. National Oceanic Atmospheric Administ ration - Fisheries (Formerly called National Marine Fisheries Service). Same as USFWS (below) Under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, NOAA - Fisheries is responsible for listed anadromous and marine fishes and marine mammals other than sea otter, manatees, and dugongs. 769 Appendix 7, Page 6 SOA. State of Alaska . E = Endangered. A species or subspecies of fish or wildlife is considered endangered when the Commissioner of the Department of Fish and Game determines that its numbers have decreased to such an extent as to indicate that its continued existence is threatened. In making this determination the commissioner shall consider: 1-the destruction, drastic modification, or severe curtailment of overutilization for commer of dise ase or predation; 4-other natural or man-ma de factors affecting it s continued existence. SSOC = State Species of Concern. On May 25, 1993, the commissioner of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game established a ne w administrative list of Species of Concern to complement the Alaska Endangered Species List. A State Species of Concern is defined as any species or subspecies of fish and wildlife native to the State of Alaska that has entered a long term decline in abundance or is vulnerable to a significant decline due to low numbers, restricted distribution, dependence on limited habita t resources, or sensitivity to environmental disturbance.

A breed ing-status S-rank can be coupled with its complementary nonbreeding-status S-rank if the spec ies also winters in the state. 770 Appendix 7, Page 7 S#? - inexact or uncertain; the ? qualifie s the character immediately preceding it in the S-rank. S#Q - questionable taxonomy that may re duce conservation priority. Distinctiveness of this entity as a taxon at the current level is questionable; re solution of this uncertainty may result in change from a species to a subspecies or hybrid, or in clusion of this taxon in another taxon, with the resulting taxon having a lower-pri ority (numerically higher) conservation status rank. S#T# - infraspecific taxon (trinomial) - the status of infraspecific taxa (subspecies or varieties) are indicated by a \"T-rank\" followi ng the species' state rank. Rules for assigning T- ranks follow the same principles outlined above. For example, the state rank of a critically imperiled subspecies of an otherwise widesp read and common species would be S5T1. A T subrank cannot imply the subspecies or variety is more abundant th an the species; for example, a S1T2 subrank should not occur. A vertebra te animal population (e.g., listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act or assign ed candidate status) may be tr acked as an infraspecific taxon and given a T rank; in such cases a Q is used after the T-rank to denote the taxon's informal taxonomic status.
