Chan School of Public Health experts have been speaking to a variety of media outlets and writing articles about the pandemic. We'll be updating this article on a regular basis.

[Yonatan Grad](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/profile/yonatan-grad/), Melvin J. and Geraldine L. Glimcher Associate Professor of Immunology and Infectious Diseases, commented on factors that may be driving the switch, such as better access to vaccines in communities of color in 2022 and improved access to care. Another factor may be a phenomenon called mortality displacement, in which an infectious disease outbreak temporarily increases death rates in a population and is followed by a period of lower mortality rates. [William Hanage](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/profile/william-p-hanage/), associate professor of epidemiology, said that hybrid immunity\u2014stronger immune protection among those infected after vaccination\u2014may also be playing a role.

Said co-author [Andrea Roberts](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/profile/andrea-lynne-roberts/), senior research scientist in the [Department of Environmental Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/environmental-health), \"What if Americans had five or six of these healthy lifestyles instead of whatever they do have now? And we calculated that about 36% of long COVID cases could have been avoided.\" February 6: [Healthy lifestyle may mean lower risk of long COVID, study says](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/06/health/long-covid-healthy-lifestyle-wellness/index.html) (CNN) [Siwen Wang](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/profile/siwen-wang/), research fellow in the [Department of Nutrition](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutrition/), quoted.

But they also warn that COVID still remains a threat. \"It's beyond question that society has moved into a stage where the pandemic is for most of us if not over then certainly quiet. And that's a great thing. Long may it remain so,\" said [William Hanage](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/profile/william-p-hanage/), associate professor of epidemiology. \"Is it the case that there is no preventable suffering? No. There is still preventable suffering and death.\" February 1: [What the end of COVID emergencies means for older adults](https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/info-2023/what-happens-when-covid-emergency-declarations-end.html) (AARP) [Anna Sinaiko](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/profile/anna-doar-sinaiko/), assistant professor of health economics and policy, was among experts discussing potential changes in health coverage, including costs for vaccines, tests, and treatments, when the COVID-19 public emergencies end in May.

Here's what will change](https://time.com/6251520/covid-19-public-health-emergency-ends-what-changes/) (Time) Ending the COVID-19 public health emergency will make it harder for some people\u2014depending on their health insurance status\u2014to access things like free vaccines, COVID-19 tests and treatments, and telehealth care. The change may also lead to higher hospital care costs for some COVID-19 patients. Health inequities could result, noted [Jose Figueroa](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/profile/jose-francisco-figueroa/), assistant professor of health policy and management. \"Will [the end of the public health emergency] change the trajectory of the pandemic?\" he said. \"It's something we are going to have to watch.\" February 1: [End of national emergencies brings new challenges to US COVID response](https://thenationaldesk.com/news/health/end-of-national-emergencies-brings-new-challenges-to-us-covid-19-response-coronavirus-vaccines-free-testing-treatments-antivirals-public-health-cdc) (The National Desk) Access to free testing will be one of the biggest changes when the COVID-19 public health emergency ends. Different people may have to pay different amounts for tests, depending on their insurance coverage. \"It's unclear what individual [health] plans will do but that's a major, major change,\" said [Jose Figueroa](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/profile/jose-francisco-figueroa/), assistant professor of health policy and management. \"There's concerns that there's going to be a lot less testing happening out in the community.\" Access to free vaccines could also end for some, which could further quell vaccine uptake. \"If when they're free, not everyone's taking them, can you imagine if you have to now pay for it?\" he said. \"It's going to be less and that will contribute to potentially future outbreaks.\" February 1: [What the End of the Covid Public Health Emergency Could Mean for You ](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/01/well/live/covid-public-health-emergency.html)(New York Times) [Jose Figueroa](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/profile/jose-francisco-figueroa/), assistant professor of health policy and management, quoted.

The panel also discussed the possibility of establishing an annual COVID-19 booster shot\u2014but held off. \"I think it's quite reasonable to think of another [update to the booster] for the fall [of 2023], but it's hard to say that it's going to be annual at this point,\" said panel member [Eric Rubin](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/profile/eric-rubin/), adjunct professor of immunology and infectious diseases. January 26: [The COVID emergency might end after 3 long years - but the virus is still a threat](https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/covid-emergency-who-1.6725543?cmp=rss) (CBC) Experts discussed how COVID will continue to threaten us for years to come.

[Bill Hanage](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/profile/william-p-hanage/), associate professor of epidemiology, noted that not much has been done to protect the most frail individuals living in nursing homes in North America. \"I think that it's kind of crazy that we [hadn't] previously developed ways to robustly rapidly test people who work in nursing homes, to prevent them bringing in respiratory viruses,\" he said.

The committee members said the information would have been important for them to have as they discussed whether or not the booster should be made available to the public. \"It's not a group of children,\" Rubin said. \"We understand how to interpret these results.\" January 10: [Coronavirus FAQ: How do I avoid catching COVID while flying in 2023?](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2023/01/09/1138627894/coronavirus-faq-how-do-i-avoid-catching-covid-while-flying-in-2023) (NPR) With COVID surging in China and the highly contagious XBB variant circulating, experts are suggesting taking precautions when flying, such as wearing a high-quality mask.
