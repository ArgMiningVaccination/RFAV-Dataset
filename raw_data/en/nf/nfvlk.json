When there are more free radicals (reactive oxygen species, ROS) in the human body than antioxidants, the condition is called oxidative stress. Oxidative stress can lead to many health challenges. Vitamin C is also a cofactor in at least eight enzymatic reactions, including several collagen synthesis reactions. Vitamin C is found in high concentrations in immune cells, and it is consumed quickly when the immune system faces a challenge. Liposomal Delivery System Liposomal encapsulation of ingredients represents a new delivery system that offers important advantages over existing methods of delivery. The liposome has hydrophilic and hydrophobic sides offering a fat and water portion which allows vitamin C to be absorbed through the fat and water soluble pathways for optimal utilization by the body. This liposomal delivery system is especially beneficial for patients who have had gastric bypass surgery, general gastro-intestinal challenges, and for those patients who require large amounts of Vitamin C.
