Part of the department's mission has always been to serve the underserved and the CHI program has been our primary vehicle for that. The CHI sites extend to serve people from all walks of life, in all circumstances, through our regular ongoing sites, and through various pop-ups at events and organizations. MUIH offers doctoral and master's degrees and a graduate certificate in acupuncture and herbal medicine. The doctoral and master's programs prepare students to achieve full clinical competency in acupuncture and to become highly skilled, integrative acupuncturists. Each program has unique characteristics that prepare students for different career tracks and aspirations. The graduate certificate provides acupuncturists with specialized skills and knowledge in the use of herbal medicine to enhance their practice.
