Developed by the Gamaleya institute in Moscow, the vaccine has been approved by Russian health authorities without undergoing phase III clinical trials required to prove the efficacy and safety of the vaccine. Although Russia has announced mass vaccination to begin in October, the effectiveness of the vaccine is yet to be known. If the vaccine in fact proves effective, it could provide several advantages to Russia. Firstly, the vaccine could enable Russia's economy to recover faster than the other countries. The demand for vaccine will also increase boosting the country's global image, while generating huge revenues. However, if the vaccine proves ineffective Russia's image could be badly damaged. In other news, Prof. Steve Hanke, an economist at Johns Hopkins, shared an article on how Sweden adopted a laissez-faire approach to the pandemic and experience fewer deaths per capita and half the GDP decline of 8.6%. The article noted that using a slightly variant approach adopted by Sweden instead of a complete lockdown could have helped with UK's economic recovery. Hanke noted that the UK National Health Service is the most overrated health system in the world. "}
