Cleansing and detoxing are very popular in the [diet](https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm) and health arenas. They may require that you drink weird concoctions or deprive yourself of your favorite foods for long periods. Cleanses and detoxes have a common goal of eliminating toxins from the body. They present these toxins as being absorbed from our workplaces and homes or from sources like [cosmetics](https://www.medicinenet.com/cosmetic_quiz_pictures_slideshow/article.htm), cleaning materials, and even food, water, and air. But are detoxes and cleanses safe? There are many diets, detoxification regimens, and therapies promoted on the market, and you must do your research to weigh the alleged benefits against any potential risks. A detox can be described as a rigorous, comprehensive regimen for the body. The goal of a body detox is to eliminate toxins, kickstart [weight loss](https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/article.htm), and encourage better health overall. The fundamental notion is that getting rid of specific types of food or eliminating solid food will allow the body to rid itself of toxins. In theory, the detox enables your [digestive system](https://www.medicinenet.com/the_digestion_process_organs_and_functions/article.htm) to rest so that the body will heal and better absorb nutrients eventually. The daily detoxification process is known as cleansing. The body is constantly detoxifying, but a cleanse is primarily focused on your digestive system. With a detox, daily meals are often replaced with drink mixtures of lemon, maple syrup, and cayenne pepper mixtures. It could also consist of fruit juices, freshly squeezed vegetables, or [green tea](https://www.medicinenet.com/green_tea_camellia_sinensis-oral/article.htm). The detox can last up to a month or be as soon as a day. Usually, a cleanse is not as restrictive as a detox is. Some fasting programs market themselves as a means of cleansing the body. This includes intermittent fasting and periodic fasting. These types of programs may claim to improve [aging](https://www.medicinenet.com/senior_health/article.htm), promote health, cause [weight loss](https://www.medicinenet.com/lose_weight_without_dieting_pictures_slideshow/article.htm), and prevent disease. No current research can validate the long-term effects of many of these programs. Are detoxes good for your body? Programs that employ a detoxing component could include various processes like fasting, herbal use, sauna use, eating certain foods, drinking only teas and juices, [dietary supplements](https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_calcium_supplements/article.htm), reduction in environmental exposures, and colon cleansing with or without enemas and hydrotherapy. The goal is to remove toxins. This attempt at removal of toxins has supposed benefits, such as: - Improved energy - Loss of weight - Reduction in [constipation](https://www.medicinenet.com/constipation/article.htm)symptoms - Less [fatigue](https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm), body aches, and [headaches](https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm) Removing certain foods from your [diet](https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_and_nutrition_quiz/quiz.htm) for a number of days, and then reintroducing them after a detox can help you identify food sensitivities. The increased intake of [vitamins](https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_calcium_supplements/article.htm) and [minerals](https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_minerals_and_nutritional_supplements/article.htm) from natural vegetables, juiced fruits, and drink [supplements](https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_minerals_and_nutritional_supplements/article.htm) may also provide detox benefits. Are detoxes and cleanses safe?

This makes your body a self-detoxification system that can naturally detoxify on its own. Many people do not know this.

These treatments could cause: - Low protein concentration in the body due to detoxing - Gastrointestinal illness and frequent bowel movements - Diminished energy, disrupted metabolic rates, and modified glucose levels There is no research on the long-term effects of detoxing diets. There was a 2015 study that found no significant results in using [detox diets](https://www.medicinenet.com/cleansing_and_detox_diets/article.htm) for [weight management](https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_management/article.htm) and elimination of detoxing kickstart initial [weight loss](https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/symptoms.htm) due to low-calorie intake, but the weight comes back once a normal diet is resumed. Are detox ingredients harmful? In the past, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have engaged in legal actions against numerous businesses that market cleansing and detox items. The basis of the lawsuit included: - The products contained possible dangerous and illegal ingredients. - The products were marketed with false claims that could lead to serious diseases. - Medical devices used for colon cleansing were not approved for their suggested use. Many detox juices contain oxalate. Oxalate is an ingredient found naturally in foods like spinach and beets. If a substantial amount of high-oxalate juice is consumed, it can increase the risk of problems in the kidneys. Drinking high amounts of herbal tea and water but not consuming a nutritional diet for an extended period can lead to dangerous [electrolyte](https://www.medicinenet.com/electrolytes/article.htm) imbalances.
