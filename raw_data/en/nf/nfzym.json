inform all keepers of poultry (which includes the egg and meat industry, game bird industry and keepers who identify themselves as either pet owners or hobbyists - please see paragraph 4 below for full description) and other captive birds (please see paragraph 5 below for full description) about the actions that government will take to control and eradicate notifiable avian disease (NAD). It details why actions are taken and who does them , who it affects and what you, as a keeper, need to do and why. 2 This document describes how an outbreak of exotic NAD in Great Britain (GB) would be managed and sets out the measures that would be applied. It also describes the measures and wider framework in place to prevent and limit an incursion of NAD. 3 The strategy aims to enable all affected during an outbreak of NAD to be better prepared to respond quickly and effectively to control and limit the outbreak, thereby mitigating the likely impact of the control measures described. 4 Poultry is defined as all birds that are reared or kept in captivity for the production of meat or eggs for consumption, the production of other products, for restocking supplies of game birds or for the purposes of any breeding programme for the production of these categories of birds. Examples b eing: Chickens, ducks, turkeys, geese, pigeon (bred for meat), partridge, quail, guinea fowl and pheasant s. 5 Other captive birds includes any bird kept in captivity which is not poultry and includes pet birds and birds kept for shows, races, exhibitions, c ompetitions, breeding or for sale. Examples include: c anaries, finches, cockatiels, parrots, penguins, puffins, flamingos and racing pigeons . 6 A glossary of terms and acronyms used in the strategy is contained in Annex 1 - Glossary of Terms . Approach 7 Since NAD could spread throughout GB irrespective of regional and political boundaries, the approach to managing an outbreak seeks complementary, consi stent and coordinated measures in all regions. This control strategy is endorsed by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), Scottish government (SG) and Welsh Government (WG) (referred to as government in this document ). Responsibility for managing an outbreak in respective regions falls to the respective government s. 2 8 Northern Ir eland (NI) is recognised as a separate epidemiological unit and would expect to operate separate but similar controls in the event of an outbreak of NAD, in accordance with European legislation (see also the NI's Notifiable Epizootic Avian Disease Control Strategy ). 9 This control strategy was prepared in consultation between government , delivery agents, the veterinary profession and a group of stakeholders with expertise relating to NAD outbreaks and their impact on owners/keepers of poultry and other captive birds. 10 The strategy reflects various pieces of legislation which set out the control measures to be implemented when NAD is suspected or confirmed in GB (s ee Annex 2 - European and GB legislation for the control of NAD ). Strategic fit 11 This control strategy is consistent with the following: The GB Animal Health and Welfare Strategy's principle that \"prevention is better than cure.\" Compliance with European law and international obligations to trading partners. Ongoing obligations for the welfare of animals. Wildlife management policies. Government's exotic disease contingency plans ( Defra's Contingency Plan for Exotic Diseases of Animals , Scottish Government's E xotic Animal Disease Contingency Framework Plan and the Welsh Government Contingency Plan for Exotic Animal Diseases ). Disease strategic control framework Disease management principles 12 Managing NAD involves managing risk. Exotic diseases are defined as those not normally present in the country and therefore risk management in this case consists of: Reducing the likelihood of outbreaks of NAD by putting in place appropriate preventive measures. Ensuring such diseases are rapidly detected if incursion does occur. Taking preparatory measures to reduce the impact of such an incursion. 13 Whilst the majority of the elements in this control strategy will only come into force if NAD is d etected, readiness to operate these measures and minimise their 3 impacts needs to be put in place in advance. This document is also therefore aimed at assisting all keepers of poultry (including game birds and poultry kept as pets) or other captive birds in their contingency planning and preparation. Disease control objective 14 If NAD is detected within GB, the key objective is to ensure a swift and effective response to the incident, rapidly assessing and closing down all risk pathways to poultry and other captive birds and resolving uncertainties as soon as possible. Government's aim is to prevent the spread of infection to domestic poultry and other captive birds through proportionate and evidence- based control measures which also: Ensure maximum protection of human safety and in particular worker safety in the event of an outbreak in poultry or other captive birds. Provide due protection for the welfare of poultry or other captive birds. Minimise the impact on international trade, the economy and the sustain ability of the poultry industry/other captive bird sector. 15 In achieving this aim, and in accordance with government 's Framework Response Plans for Exotic Animal Diseases, the disease control strategy aims first and foremost to restore the United Kingdom's (UK) disease free status as quickly as possible. In doing so, government seeks to select control strategies which: Protect public health. Minimise the number of animals which need to be culled either to control the disease or on welfare grounds. Cause the least possible disruption to the food, farming and tourism industries, to visitors to the countryside, and to rural communities in the wider economy. Minimise damage to the natural environment. Minimise the burden on the taxpayers and the public. Approach to disease control 16 Key principles include: Early detection and reporting of suspicion of NAD to limit the extent to which disease can spread before controls are brought into force, thereby reducing the extent of the outbreak. Containing disease at premises where it is detected and eradicating it swiftly and effectively. 4 Limiting the risk of any further spread of disease from premises connected with the infected premises (IP). Limiting the risk of any further spread of disease to other premises in the vicinity of the IP. Undertaking risk assessments based on an epidemiological assessment before easing restrictions. Continuing heightened surveillance before easing restrictions. Complying with European legislative obligations. 5 Definitions of notifiable avian disease 17 There are two NADs - avian influenza (AI) and Newcastle disease (ND). A notifiable disease is one that must be notified by law if it is suspected or diagnosed. 18 Anyone in possession of any bird or bird carcase (excluding a wild bird or wild bird carcase) which they suspect may be infected with NAD must immediately notify the APHA . In addition, any person who has in their possession a mammal or mammal carcase which they suspect may be infected with influenza virus of avian origin (see paragraphs 204-213) must inform APHA . 19 Only certain AI viruses and avian paramyxoviruses (of which avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV -1) virus causes ND) require government intervention (definitions for AI and ND are provided in Annex 1 - Glossary of Terms ). These can only be distinguished from viruses not requiring government intervention (i.e. those that fall outside these definitions) through laboratory testing. Therefore, any clinical signs or laboratory test results that lead to suspicion of infection with NAD viruses must be immediately notified to the APHA duty vet. Avian influenza Avian influenza in poultry and other captive birds 20 There are many strains of AI viruses, which vary in their ability to cause disease. AI viruses are categorised according to this ability to cause severe disease (pathogenicity) in avian species as either highly pathogenic or low pathogenic. They are also categorised according to the properties of their surface proteins (haemagglutinin (H1-H16) and neuraminidase (N1-N9)). To date, only AI viruses of subtypes H5 and H7 have caused highly pathogenic infection in birds. Based on this and for the purposes of the NAD control measures outlined in this document, AI is defined as: An infection of poultry (including game birds and poultry kept as pets) or other captive birds 1 with any highly pathogenic influenza A virus (see Annex 1 - Glossary of Terms : Highly pathogenic avian influenza). An infec tion of poultry or other captive birds with influenza A virus of H5 or H7 subtype that is not classified as highly pathogenic (see Annex 1 - Glossary of Terms : Low pathogenic avian influenza). 1 For definitions of poultry (including game birds and pet poultry species) and other captive birds , please see Annex 1 - Glossary of Terms . 6 21 Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) can rapidly cause severe disease, usually with high mortality, in chickens and turkeys (and other \"galliform\" poultry ) but may not cause obvious disease in waterfowl. Infection in galliform poultry is associated with severe systemic disease, possibly sudden death, and signs include quietness, depression, drops in feed/water intake and in egg production, followed by respiratory signs (such as sneezing, coughing, ocular and n asal discharge, and sinusitis) or nervous signs (such as incoordination, twisted necks and drooping wings). There may also be diarrhoea, swelling of the head and blue discolouration of the comb and wattles. 22 Low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) does not always cause obvious disease in birds but this can be aggravated by secondary infections or stressors. Infection may be associated with significant drops in feed/water intake and in egg production in laying birds. There may be respiratory signs such as sneezing, coughing, ocular and nasal discharge, and sinusitis. 23 AI is predominantly spread by movement of infected birds or contact with respiratory secretions, and in particular faeces, either directly or through contaminated objects. Avian influenza in wild b irds 24 AI viruses are known to circulate in the global wildfowl population. These viruses may be of all influenza A subtypes and are usually LPAI viruses. However, there has been evidence of HPAI virus spread in wild birds (e.g. HPAI H5N1). In relation to AI in wild birds, action will only be taken in the event of HPAI H5N1 being confirmed in a wild bird or wild bird carcase (see paragraphs 214-227). Avian influenza in humans and other mammals 25 AI is caused by influenza viruses closely related to human influenza viruses. Transmission to humans in close contact with poultry or other captive birds occurs rarely and only with some strains of AI viruses. In rare cases, some strains have led to severe disease and deaths in people where infection has resulted from close contact with infected birds. To date, such strains have been associated with limited human to human transmission. 26 There is evidence that AI viruses can exchange genetic material with human influenza viruses and result in the emergence of new viruses that may be capable of being spread easily between people. The global human population may have little or no immunity to a new influenza virus that significantly differs from recent or existing strains of human influenza viruses. Therefore, for any outbreak of AI (or viruses that include a re- assortment of genetic material including AI virus) workers and veterinarians in close contact with infected birds must be appropriately 7 protected (see paragraphs 115-121). More information is available from the World Health Organisation . 27 In addition to human infection, AI viruses can also infect other species of mammals (see paragraphs 204-213). 28 (For further information on AI, see: World Organisation for Animal Health ; European Commission ; Defra; Scottish Government ; Welsh Government ). Newcastle disease Newcastle disease in poultry and other captive birds 29 For the purposes of the NAD control measures outlined in this documen t, ND is defined as: An infection of poultry (including game birds and poultry kept as pets) or other captive birds caused by any avian strain of the paramyxovirus 1 (APMV -1) fulfilling certain criteria for virulence (see Annex 1 - Glossary of Terms : Newcastle disease). 30 Newcastle Disease can produce variable clinical signs in affected birds but mortality can be high and young birds are particularly susceptible. The disease can present as a very acute form ranging from sub -clinical disease (meaning no clinical signs are present ) to mild. The signs depend on which body system the strain of the virus predominantly affects (the respiratory, digestive or nervous system) and can have a sudden onset and high mortality. Signs can include quietness, depression, drops in feed/water intake and in egg production in laying birds with a high proportion of eggs laid with abnormal (soft) shells. There may be respiratory distress (with gaping, coughing, sneezing, gurgling and rattling), yellowish green diarrhoea or nervous signs (such as tremors, incoordination, twisted necks and drooping wings and paralysis). 31 APMV- 1 viruses are known to circulate in wild bird populations. Usually these are viruses of low virulence. However, there have been reports of probable spread of virulent strains by wild birds. There is also evidence that low virulence viruses may rarely mutate to high virulence strains in poultry . 32 (For further information on ND, see: World Organisation for Animal Health ; European Commission ; Defra; Scottish Government ; Welsh Government ). Pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 33 A pigeon- adapted strain of APMV -1 also occ urs, also known as pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 (PPMV -1). In pigeons infected with this virus, clinical signs include diarrhoea, reluctance to move or take exercise, depression, anorexia, quietness and nervous signs. In the GB domestic pigeon population there are, on 8 average, 15- 20 cases of the disease per annum . (See paragraphs 191, 192 and 198 for control measures specific to outbreaks of PPMV - 1 in pigeons). 34 Infectio ns are usually restricted to pigeon lofts. However, occasionally virulent strains of this virus strain can infect poultry (including game birds and poultry kept as pets) causing ND (e.g. outbreak of ND in East Lothian in 2006): in such events, the control measures detailed in this strategy in relation to ND apply. Previous outbreaks in GB 35 There have been several outbreaks of NAD in GB over the past decade. These are summarised below. Notifiable Avian Disease incidents in GB since 2006 As at August 2018. Avian Influenza : o Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N6, (wild birds), Suffolk, April 2018 H5N6, (wild birds), Berkshire, Devon, Vale of Glamorgan, Hampshire, Hertfordshire, Lincolnshire, Oxfordshire, Warwickshire, February 2018 (wild birds), Dorset, Hertfordshire, North West London, Rutland, Warwickshire, West Yorkshire, January December 2016 Lancashire, July 2015 H5N8, Yorkshire, November 2014 H7N7, Oxfordshire, June 2008 H5N1 (wild birds), Dorset, January 2008 H5N1, Norfolk, November 2007 H5N1, Suffolk, February 2007 H5N1 (wild birds), Cellardyke, April 2006 o Low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H5N1, Fife, January 2016 H7N7, Hampshire, February 2015 H7N2, Merseyside, May 2007 H7N2, Conwy, May 2007 H7N3, Norfolk, April 2006 Newcastle disease : o East Lothian, October 2006 10 Maintaining disease freedom 36 Where appropriate, or required by European legislation, countermeasures are put into place which aim to reduce the risk of the introduction of NAD to GB. Vigilance and prompt reporting 37 Early detection of NAD in poultry (including game birds and poultry kept as pets) and other captive birds is key to lessening the extent of disease spread. Keepers of poultry and other captive birds are strongly encouraged to remain vigilant for clinical signs of NAD in their birds and must promptly notify suspect cases to the APHA . Biosecurity 38 Good biosecurity is a vital part of keeping disease away from poultry (including game birds and poultry kept as pets) and other captive birds. All keepers of poultry need to maintain high biosecurity standards for protection from disease (not just those that are not ifiable). Keepers should also prepare a contingency plan and consider arrangements in the event that they are within a movement control zone during an outbreak of NAD so that they are prepared for any increase in the risk of disease and the effects of movement restrictions. Keepers of other captive birds (especially of larger collections - e.g. zoos) should also consider biosecurity and contingency planning arrangements. 39 This risk of disease is always present and keepers are strongly recommended to plan for the impact of a disease outbreak: Directly - e.g. if their premises were to be infected (see paragraphs 113- 142) or in a disease control zone (see paragraphs 155-184 and 214-227). Indirectly - e.g. if usual trade/movement outlets were affected. 40 Keepers are strongly recommended to limit the movement of poultry , people, vehicles and equipment between farms and keep records of the types of movements that take place to assist APHA in carrying out tracings (see paragraphs 65, 66 and 143-154). 41 Government makes biosecurity advice available to keepers of poultry and other captive birds on GOV.UK. 42 Welfare codes for laying hens, meat and breeding chickens, ducks and turkeys are published on the GOV.UK website ( Defra , SG and WG ). Defra have also published a Code of Practice for the Welfare of Gamebirds Reared for Sporting Purposes . 11 Surveillance 43 Government carries out surveillance for NAD in accordance with European legislative requirements. Avian influenza surveillance - poultry 44 Government carries out active surveillance through the national survey for avian influenza of subtypes H5 and H7 in domestic poultry (including game birds and poultry kept as pets). The aim of the survey is to identify the circulation of AI viruses in poultry (in particular, waterfowl poultry species) before they become widespread in the poultry population. Samples are taken from a random selection of premises and are subject to serological testing for AI antibodies. It is not unusual for a small number of samples taken to test positive for H5 or H7 antibodies each year during the survey. These trigger further enquiries at the premises in question (see paragraph 76) and further laboratory testing (see paragraphs 86-90). If these tests show that disease is present, the control measures descr ibed in paragraphs 113-142 will apply. If the tests show that the initial positive results were due to past infection with AI and the disease is not now present in the flock, restrictions are lifted at the premises. Avian influenza surveillance - wild birds 45 European Union (EU) Member States ( MSs) are required to contribute to the knowledge of the threats posed by wild birds in relation to AI. The aim of surveillance is to ensure the timely detection of HPAI H5N1 by investigating increased incidence of morbidity and mortality in wild birds, particularly in selected target species and areas. 46 Government carries out surveillance through the UK wild bird survey for avian influenza viruses. Paragraphs 214-227 describe the measures put in place if HPAI H5N1 is detected in a wild bird or wild bird carcase as a result of such surveillance. Imports 47 In order to maintain GB's animal and public health status, various measures are put in place to ensure that imported animals and products of animal origin do not present unacceptable risks to the health of other animals or to people. Imports of live animals and products of animal origin are controlled to prevent the import of disease into GB. Further information on imports is available. Imports to the United Kingdom from within the European Union 48 If an EU MS experiences an outbreak of NAD, legislation and trade rules set out the measures that must be adopted by that MS to prevent the spread of the 12 disease. If the situation demands it, the European Commission (EC) will impose additional safeguard measures. 49 Intra-community trade in live poultry (including game birds and poultry kept as pets) and hatching eggs has to be accompanied by veterinary certificates (ITAHCs) indicating the poultry or hatching eggs do not come from flocks or premises that are located within areas under restrictions for outbreaks of NAD. The import of table eggs from such areas may be permitted if such products are handled and treated in accordance with European legislation. Separate rules are in place governing the import of poultry meat products, poultry by-products, other captive birds and pet birds from the EU into the UK. Imports to the United Kingdom from outside the European Union 50 Imports are only permitted from a restricted list of Third Countries which meet EU standards f or the control of NAD. 51 Poultry (including game birds and poultry kept as pets) and eggs imported into the EU must enter at designated Border Inspection Posts, where they are subject to veterinary inspections. All consignments are subject to documentary and identity checks to ensure that the conditions of import are met. All imported birds must undergo a period of quarantine. From the time of import, live poultry , or eggs once hatched, must be isolated for at least 6 weeks at the premises of destination to ensure they are not carrying any disease. 52 Separate rules are in place governing the import of poultry meat products, poultry by-products, captive birds and pet birds from outside the EU into the UK. Preventive vaccination 53 Preventive vaccination is recognised as a potential disease control measure. The approach adopted differs according to the disease. Avian Influenza 54 Subject to the approval of the European Commission (EC), MSs can introduce preventive vaccination of poultry or other captive birds as a long term measure where certain areas, type of premises or categories of poultry or other captive birds are deemed to be exposed to the risk of AI. 55 GB is not currently exposed to such a risk of AI, and preventive vaccination of poultry (including game birds and poultry kept as pets) against AI is not recommended as a means to protect GB against outbreaks of LPAI and HPAI. In addition, the GB poultry sector is structured differently to that in other MSs where this strategy has been adopted. 56 There are also a number of disadvantages relating to currently available vaccines: 13 Although the vaccines are able to reduce mortality, it is likely that some vaccinated birds would still be capable of transmitting AI virus if they became infected, increasing the time taken to detect and eradicate this virus. Influenza viruses can mutate rapidly, which could render a vaccine less useful. This is relevant when trying to get a good match between an outbreak virus and the vaccine held in a vaccine bank. The outbreak virus cannot be predicted with any certainty. The vaccines present serious practical limitations in that they need to be delivered by individually injecting each bird. It can take up to 3 weeks for the birds to deliver optimum immunity, and some poultry require 2 dos es, with a 4-6 week interval between these. There is no proven efficacy of the vaccines in species such as ducks, geese and game birds. It is difficult to differentiate infected from vaccinated birds. There are welfare implications for birds through increased handling, especially when speed is necessary. Vaccination may induce a false sense of security, resulting in a relaxation of biosecurity and vigilance. There will be a risk to workers from the increased handling of birds. 57 This policy may be subject to review if, in the future, there are major changes to the structure of the poultry industry in GB, major changes in the epidemiology of AI or significant progress in vaccine development. Avian influenza - zoo birds 58 Due to the role of zoos in global conservation, vaccination of zoo birds is permitted in England subject to meeting eligibility criteria. Permission must be sought from Defra by contacting contingency.planning@apha.gov.uk England's zoo bird vaccination plan was approved by the EC. 59 Vaccination of zoo birds against AI is not permitted in Scotland or Wales on the basis of veterinary risk assessment (VRA). This will be reviewed should the risk of AI to zoo birds change. Newcastle disease 60 Vaccines for ND with marketing authorisations are commercially available and bird owners can choose whether or not to vaccinate their birds. Vaccination is common in most, if not all, commercial layers, layer breeders and broiler breeders. It is also common in most turkey breeders and some commercial 14 turkeys and broilers. It is a legal requirement to keep a record of all medicines (including vaccines) administered to food- producing animals (see Health and Safety Executive and Veterinary Medicine Directorate guidance). Criteria for live vaccines for ND are set out in European legislation ( Annex 2 - European and GB legislation for the control of NAD ). Pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 61 Legislation requires that pigeons must be vaccinated against PPMV- 1 if they are to be raced or shown. It is the responsibility of the organiser of a race or show to ensure that pigeons entered have been vaccinated. Great Britain Poultry Register 62 It is a l egal requirement that premises where 50 or more poultry (including game birds and poultry kept as pets) are kept must be registered on the GB Poultry Register (GBPR). The aim of the GBPR is to provide information regarding the location and density of poultry populations in GB. In a disease outbreak, it provides essential information which assists government in the delivery of disease control measures. Upon confirmation of disease, the register allows the initial location of premises containing poultry in the infected area to be identified. 63 Owners/occupiers of premises with less th an 50 poultry (including those with significant populations of other captive birds) are also encouraged to voluntarily register their flock on the GB Poultry Register using the simplified and user - friendly form. 64 Text alerts are also sent to all those on the register in the event of an outbreak. Movement records 65 Owners/keepers of flocks of poultry (including game birds and poultry kept as pets) of over 250 birds are required to keep records of poultry leaving or entering their premises. Similarly, any person involved in the transport or marketing of any poultry or eggs must keep a record of all poultry or eggs they transport or market. These records must be kept for 12 months and are vital in cases where NAD is suspected or confirmed and contact premises need to be identified. 66 In addition to legal requirements, all keepers of poultry or other captive birds are encouraged to consider and, where appropriate, implement record keeping measures that would assist APHA in carrying out tracings (see paragraphs 143- 154) in the event of an outbreak of NAD. Bird gatherings 67 Under European legislation, bird gatherings are prohibited unless authorised in that MS by a V eterinary Risk A ssessment (VRA) . Government's risk assessment 15 is that bird gatherings can take place subject to compliance with the conditions in a general licence. Separate licenses apply for gatherings taking place in England , Scotland and Wales . Raising stakeholder awareness 68 Advice on maintaining disease free flocks is made available to poultry (including game birds and poultry kept as pets) keepers on the GOV.UK website, including the following: Biosecurity and preventing disease in captive birds Avian Influenza: Biosecurity information for all bird keepers Newcastle Disease: Advice for bird keepers 69 Owners/ keepers of poultry or other captive birds are encouraged to consult private veterinarians as soon as possible if they are concerned about their flock's health, biosecurity practices or disease ris k. 16 Heightened risk of incursions of notifiable avian disease into Great Britain International surveillance and monitoring 70 With regards to outbreaks of NAD in other countries, government monitors the international disease situation . Preliminary outbreak assessments may be published on the GOV.UK website upon notification of a disease outbreak from the EU or World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). For outbreaks of NAD in an EU MS, a country bordering the EU or a trading partner, more in- depth qualitative risk assessments may be carried out by government . These are designed to give a balanced account of the threat of the disease incidence to GB at present and in the future. Both assessments are used to inform government 's decision on the risk level of AI or ND in GB and inform the consideration of preventive controls. 71 Any changes to the level of risk of the introduction of NAD into GB are underpinned by risk assessment as set out above. Stakeholders will be upd ated on such changes. Prevention zone 72 Following a qualitative risk assessment, it may be considered necessary to assess whether any preventive action is required to reduce the risk of transmission of NAD from wild birds to poultry (including game birds and poultry kept as pets) or other captive birds. 73 If considered necessary, government may declare a n Avian Influenza Prevention Zone (AIPZ). Keepers with premises within the AI PZ would be legally required to put in place additional protective measures, including: Provision of bedding, feed and water to which wild birds have no access for poultry and other captive birds. Enhanced biosecurity at premises where poultry or other captive birds are kept. Banning or limiting bird gatherings. 17 Exceptionally, the housing of poultry and other captive birds, or their separation from wild birds (may be applied to certain categories of birds dependent on risk)2. 74 Government's position is that such a zone and associated measures would only be applied where it is decided that the disease risk is such that the extra biosecurity requirements would have a positive impact in reducing the risk of infection in a holding 3. This could include developments in Europe concerning a highly pathogenic strain of the virus causing high mortality and morbidity in domestic poultry , where wild birds have been demonstrated to be involved in the spread of the virus. 75 Any such decision would be based on the evidence and risk assessments available at that time and based of vet erinary, scientific and expert ornithological advice, and would be discussed in advance with the Notifiable Avian Disease Core Group. This would be supplemented by: Analysis of the costs associated with imposing a prevention zone (e.g. industry response, production and welfare costs) compared to the benefits in terms of reduced risk of disease spread. Assessment of the impacts a prevention zone may have on consumer confidence (e.g. if housing were required in such a zone). 2 Products of free range flocks that are required to be housed can retain their free range status, provided the housed period does not exceed 12 weeks on a flock -by-flock basis for poultrymeat as set out in Commission Regulation 543/2008, or 16 weeks on a flo ck-by-flock for eggs as set out in Commission Regulation 589/2008 (see the guidance on GOV.UK for further information). The exemption does not apply in situations where the owner voluntarily decides to house their birds. 3 Note that if considered necessary to reduce the risk of spread of avian influenza, similar measures could be applied through a wider restricted zone (RZ) when HPAI is confirmed in poultry (including game birds and pet hens and other poultry species) (see paragraph 165) or through a wild bird control area (WBCA) or wild bird monitoring area (WBMA) when H5N1 is found in wild birds (See paragraph 225). When H5N1 is confirmed in poultry (including game birds and pet hens and other poultry species), it is a requirement under European legislation that a RZ must be declared. The measures applied could include those listed here and would be based on VRA (See paragraphs 166- 167). 18 Suspicion of notifiable avian disease in Great Britain General principles 76 Government surveillance or the reporting of clinical signs consistent with those of NAD in poultry (including game birds and poultry kept as pets) or other captive birds may lead to suspicion being raised regarding the presence of NAD. Official investigations (veterinary inquiries) are triggered, with laboratory testing of samples being carried out if disease cannot be ruled out on clinical grounds. Measures may also be imposed on and in the area surrounding suspect premises, depending upon the level of suspicion and legislative powers. The strategic aim of these measures is to: Establish whether NAD is present. Establish the origin and any potential routes of spread if disease is confirmed. To put in place appropriate measures to prevent disease spread. Notification to Animal and Plant Health Agency 77 Anyone in possession of any bird or bird carcase (excluding a wild bird or wild bird carcase) which they suspect may be infected with NAD must immedi ately notify APHA . 78 Avenues of notification include the following: Directly by the owner/person responsible for the birds in question. By a p rivate veterinarian called by the owner/person responsible for the birds in question to assess or treat these birds. By an inspector (e.g. from the Local Authority) attending the premises on other business (e.g. animal welfare grounds). As a result of active government surveillance (e.g. the GB Poultry Survey). By Food Standards Agency (FSA) staff at a slaughterhouse suspecting disease as a result of ante/post -mortem inspections (NB paragraph 76 and 79 to 84 do not apply if this is the case - see paragraphs 93-98 for information specific to slaughterhouses). 79 Upon reporting, an APHA vet will discuss the clinical signs and health status of the birds in question over the phone with the person reporting suspicion of NAD. Such discussions may allow the APHA vet to rule out NAD. Alternatively, an 19 APHA vet will be dispatched within 30 minutes of the initial phone call to the premises to carry out an official investigation as set out in paragraphs 82-84. 80 If this is the case, the owner/person will be reminded of the legal requirement that the birds and things liable to transmit/spread disease must not be moved off the premises (e.g. live birds, manure etc.) and that no live birds can be moved on to the premises. Any movements already in transit/process should be raised during this conversation so that appropriate measures can be put in place. Testing for Exclusion Scheme and Consultation Cases 81 For private veterinary surgeons (PVS), where NAD cannot be excluded from the differential diagnosis of a flock health or production problem, the PVS can contact APHA and, in consultation with an APHA vet, agree that either: NAD is not suspected from the clinical signs and the PVS can submit samples for testing to exclude the involvement of a NAD ( http://apha.defra.gov.uk/vet - gateway/tte/nad.htm ). Usually official disease control restrictions will not be applied, although the farmer should consider, with their PVS, any voluntary restrictions that may be appropriate and should report any changes in the birds that result in suspicion of infec tion with NAD. Please note that this scheme is only available for chicken and turkey flocks and the PVS will be charged the full cost for testing. Negative results will be sent directly to the submitting PVS and non- negative results will trigger an official investigation by APHA. 82 or: NAD cannot be ruled out and an APHA vet will attend the premises to carry out a \"consultation case\". Disease control restrictions will not be triggered but the PVS must remain in constant supervision of the premises to prevent any high risk movements until the consultation is completed, where either agreement is reached that there is no suspicion of a NAD, or that suspicion cannot be ruled out and an official investigation started by the APHA vet, as set out in paragraphs 83-85. Actions at suspect premises Suspect premises 83 Upon arrival at the premises, the visiting APHA vet will examine the birds and other records as necessary (e.g. production records) and discuss the case with APHA's Veterinary Exotic Notifiable Disease Unit (VENDU). If disease can be ruled out on clinical grounds, the APHA vet will lift restrictions placed on the premises. If disease cannot be ruled out on clinical grounds, the premises will be 20 declared a suspect premises. Blood samples and swabs will be taken from an appropriate selection of birds and submitted for testing at the national reference laboratory. The following measures will also apply at the premises. APHA will apply these measures according to the premises type. Key measures at suspect premises: Records - the visiting APHA vet will examine production records for poultry (including game birds and poultry kept as pets) and other captive birds kept at the premises. These must include the number (or approximate number) of birds within each species which are alive, have died, are ill or are hatched. Records must also be kept in relation to domestic mammals at the premises. Housing or isolation - poultry and other captive birds must be kept in their buildings or kept isolated as far as practicable from other poultry and wild birds. Movements of poultry and other captive birds to and from the premises - these will be prohibited and are highly unlikely to be licensed at this stage. Movements of other things liable to transmit disease (including people, vehicles and eggs) - low risk movements may be licensed subject to certain conditions (e.g. people off the premises). Disinfection at entrances and exits - a means of cleansing and disinfection (C &D) must be provided at the entrances and exits of the premises and of buildings there which house poultry or other captive birds (this may not be applied where NAD is suspected in other captive birds at non- commercial premises - e.g. where the premises is a domestic dwelling). An approved disinfectant under Poultry Orders must be used at the appropriate concentration. Warning signs - warning signs must be erected at appropriate places at the premises. Veterinary inquiry 84 An epidemiological investigation will begin to establish, as far as possible: How long the disease may have been present on the premises. The likely source of infection. Whether the disease is a potential primary case or whether it originated from another premises. Whether any other premises may have been exposed to the disease as a result of the suspect case. The extent to which the disease may have been carried to or from the suspect premis es. 85 This will inform any initial further investigations to be carried out (e.g. if live birds were moved to or from the premises during the incubation period). 21 Diagnostic investigation at the Animal and Plant Health Agency 86 The National Reference Laboratory for both AI and ND is: APHA Veterinary Investigation Centre, Upon arrival at the APHA laboratory , samples will be tested for NAD. A series of pre-agreed tests will be carried out, with results reported by the APHA laboratory to VENDU. 88 Initial results, that suggest that one or both of those viruses is present, can be expected within 12 hours of the tests beginning. However, confirmatory tests do take longer - e.g. for the full characterisation of the virus or pathogenicity of any AI or ND virus. 89 Final negative results that inform VENDU's decision regarding the lifting of restrictions ( outlined in paragraph 87) are likely to be available from six days after the submission of samples. 90 As the national and International Reference Laboratory for both AI and ND, the APHA continually works to reduce the time taken for validatory testing to be completed, in accordance with EU and international standards. \"High\" level of suspicion 91 If considered necessary by government to control the disease, legislation provides for more stringent measures to be implemented at suspec t premises. The killing of poultry (including game birds and poultry kept as pets) or captive birds can be carried out, with carcases and eggs having to be disposed of, tracings made and initial C&D (see paragraphs 132-133) of premises carried out by APHA. 92 At present, government does not foresee circumstances outside of an existing outbreak of NAD in GB under which we would require the culling of poultry or other captive birds without laboratory confirmation of disease. On welfare 22 grounds, the owner/occupier of the premises can choose to cull birds prior to confirmation (see paragraphs 126-128 on compensation). Suspicion at slaughterhouses 93 Legislation sets out different rules if poultry (including game birds) or poultry carcases at a slaughterhouse are suspected of being infected with NAD. Notification must be made in the usual way to the APHA. A further investigation will then be necessary and the following legal requirements apply: No other poultry must be brought into the slaughterhouse (subject to consideration of the welfare of poultry at or en- route to the slaughterhouse). Things liable to transmit disease (e.g. carcases, poultry meat, and waste), people and vehicles will not be allowed to leave the premises until licensed by an APHA vet . Any suspect live poultry , live poultry from the same premises as the suspect poultry and any poultry they have had contact with must be slaughtered according to the instructions of a n APHA vet . If any of those poultry have already been slaughtered, the carcases and any carcases they have been in contact with must be isolated: the operator must ensure that they do not come into contact with other poultry or carcases. 94 Simultaneously, an investigation at the premises of origin will be carried out as described previously in paragraph 76. 95 On arrival at the slaughterhouse the APHA vet will examine the poultry or poultry carcases. If t hey cannot rule out NAD on clinical grounds, a notice is served on the operator setting out the restrictions that apply. After inspection and the taking of samples, the following will be required to be slaughtered separately from other poultry : All suspect poultry . All poultry from the same premises as the suspect poultry . Any poultry that have had contact with suspect poultry . 96 Carcases from these poultry must be stored separately from carcases of other poultry . Samples will be taken to test whether NAD is present in the slaughterhouse or not. If the occupier completes C&D in accordance with instructions from APHA (i.e. of areas potentially contaminated by infected poultry or poultry carcases) during this time, live poultry may be allowed to enter the slaughterhouse again for slaughter. 23 97 Laboratory testing as described in paragraphs 86-90 will be carried out. If the test results are negative, the APHA vet will inform the occupier in writing that the measures above cease to apply. Throughout the investigation, the slaughterhous e operator remains responsible for maintaining the carcases in line with food hygiene regulations. Where disease is negated and restrictions are lifted, and subject to compliance with food hygiene regulations and official checks throughout the period of restrictions, poultry meat may enter the food chain. 98 For confirmation of NAD in a slaughterhouse, see paragraphs 141-142. Area restrictions around the suspect premises 99 Powers exist for additional measures to be implemented in the area around suspect premises if they are deemed necessary to minimise the risk of the spread of NAD from a suspect premises. 100 To date, area restrictions have not been implemented upon suspicion of a potential first case of NAD in GB. At present, it is unlikely that area restrictions would be imposed for such a first case without laboratory confirmation of disease. Confirmation of influenza A virus or APMV -1 infections in poultry or other captive birds outside the definition of notifiable avian disease 101 Subsequent sections deal with actions on confirmation of NAD (as defined in Annex 1 - Glossary of Terms ). For isolation of influenza A virus and APMV -1 viruses that fall outside of these definitions, restrictions at suspect premises are lifted (see paragrap hs 115-121 for measures that may still be required in relation to worker protection). 24 Confirmation of a case of notifiable avian disease in Great Britain Confirming notifiable avian disease 102 NAD is confirmed by the Chief Veterinary Officer ( CVO ) for the country where disease is found upon laboratory confirmation of the presence of NAD virus. It is important to note that, at this stage, further laboratory tests may still be ongoing (e.g. AI virus of the subtype H5 or H7 has been confirmed, even though pathogenicity and N type may yet to be established). 103 Once disease is confirmed, a series of actions is initiated through the implementation of Government Contingency Plans. These include declaring relevant disease control zones, confirming measures within the zones and carrying out certain actions at the IP. International notification obligation s 104 The UK CVO notifies the OIE of the presence of NAD in the UK within 24 hours of confirming disease. The European Commission ( EC) is also notified. Regular reports are submitted to the OIE and EC as the outbreak progresses. On notification of disease to the EU and OIE, the UK will lose its disease free status for that particular disease if the outbreak occurs in poultry (including game birds and poultry kept as pets) (i.e. outbreaks in other captive birds or wild birds do not affect the UK's status, althou gh there may be implications for trade with some Third Countries). Trade Exports to other European Union countries 105 Trade in live poultry (including game birds) , poultry products and other captive birds from the UK to other Member States usually continues unaffected by an outbreak provided that the poultry or eggs do not come from premises under restrictions or within disease control zones (see paragraphs 155-184). In outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 in poultry , additional restrictions on bird by -products and wild ga me products may apply (see paragraphs 166-167). Depending on the extent of the outbreak, the number of infected premises and disease control zones, additional safeguard measures may be applied by the E U which could impose additional restrictions (e.g. to areas outside of disease control zones). 25 Exports to non-European Union c ountries 106 Export health certificates agreed with non- EU countries vary and reflect the destination country's import conditions, which are subject to change. Some Third Countries will suspend imports from the UK even though the previously agreed export health certificates can be signed. In case the entire territory of the UK is not banned from trade, two concepts are described in the OIE Terrestrial Code that can be followed to facilitate trade whilst mitigating the risk to an acceptable level. Regionalisation 107 Regionalisation (also called \"zoning\") is a method defined in the OIE Terrestrial Code that allows for areas unaffected by disease outbreaks to continue safe trade internationally. This concept involves the designation of a geographical area with various measures applied to it to keep the disease inside that zone (or zones) and applies surveillance to ensure disease is not present in the \"free\" areas. 108 As described earlier in this document, for EU trade purposes, Zoning (Regionalisation) is achieved through the application of a protection zone ( PZ) and surveillance zone ( SZ) and any additional restricted zones (see Disease control zones ). The rest of the country is unaffected for the purposes of EU trade. The UK encourages countries outside the EU to adopt regionalis ation as it is applied in the EU, i.e. on the basis of disease control zones (SZ) - these are notified publicly on the Gov.uk website. 109 The rest of the country (the disease free zone) is unaffected for trade purposes and the risk managed to an acceptable level, supported by our active and passive AI surveillance in poultry and wild birds. 110 Where countries outside the EU are unable to accept exports from the disease free zone as described above, the UK may agree to apply international trade restrictions to the administrative area(s) that contain the disease control zones. Compartmentalisation 111 This is a different concept of mitigating the risk of disease, which is currently only applicable to high- value genetic poultry stock. 112 A compartment is made up of individual premises run by the same company which, while geographically separated, adhere by the same strict biosecurity rules, including tight veterinary supervision, regular inspections by the competent authority, addit ional disease testing and clinical surveillance. 26 Actions at infected premises (IP) Measures 113 Notice will be served on the premises declaring it to be an IP. Certain actions must be carried out at the IP to minimise the possibility of the onward spread of the disease as set out in legislation. The measures described in paragraphs 83-85 (suspect premises) will continue to apply. Key measures at infected premises: Culling - the default position is that all poultry (including game birds and poultry kept as pets) and other captive birds at the IP will be culled (see paragraphs 123-125). Disposal - all carcases, eggs and any other contaminated material must be disposed of (see paragraphs 129-131). Initial C&D will be carried out by APHA (see paragraphs 132-133). Derogations 114 See paragraphs 184-191 for circumstances under which deviation from this policy position may be considered. Worker protection 115 Overall responsibility for protecting public health during an outbreak rests with the National Health Service. In the event of an outbreak or suspected incidence of AI, it is a priority to protect the health of those coming into direct contact with diseased birds (e.g. poultry workers, APHA staff). Government, the Department of Health, SG Health and Social Care D irectorate, the Health Protection Agency, Public Health Wales, Health Protection Scotland and APHA will all be involved to ensure that appropriate measures are taken to control disease and protect the health of such people. 116 There are two main concerns regarding human health during an outbreak of AI: Protection of the health of those in close proximity to infected birds (e.g. poultry workers) by reducing exposure to material contaminated by the virus and ensuring access to appropriate preventive medication. Protection of the health of the wider human population by reducing the likelihood of genetic re -assortment of the virus, which could occur if an individual is simultaneously infected with both human and AI viruses. This involves both protecting the individual from infection with AI and vaccinating them against human influenza. 27 117 In cases where individuals, such as poultry workers, have had, or are likely to have, contact with infected birds, measures may be recommended following a risk assessment by the responsible health protection authority, including: Guidance to those at risk of infection. Monitoring of health status of persons exposed to infected birds. Limiting exposure to potentially infected birds and other birds. Wearing of appropriate personal protective equipment, including respiratory protection, and its safe disposal. Vaccination for seasonal influenza (routine vaccination with seasonal influenza vaccine is recommended for all poultry workers). The prophylactic use of antiviral medicine. 118 The implementation of these measures will be based on the probability of transmission of the virus to employees and the likely severity of disease in people, factors which are dependent on, for example, the virus strain and type of IP. Virus strains which fall outside of the de finition for AI in poultry or other captive birds may still require measures to be implemented to protect human health. 119 In all cases, health protection authorities will work with the owner/occupier of the premises to ensure that proportionate and appropriate measures are put in place to protect human health. 120 The Health and Safety Executive have published guidance on the GOV.UK website. This advice should be communicated to keepers of birds or those working with birds under such circumstances and in the case of larger poultry companies, be integrated into contingency plans. 121 During an outbreak, government will take measures to protect its workers with the necessary anti -viral drugs and equipment, if appropriate. Food safety 122 FSA advice is that neither AI nor ND pose a food safety risk for consumers if poultry meat and eggs are properly handled and prepared (on AI, see guidance from the FSA and Food Standards Scotland ). However there are requirements for the tracing of such products from an IP in order to protect animal health (See paragraphs 144-148). Culling of birds 123 Key principles apply in the culling of birds for disease control purposes, including: Human health and welfare considerations are paramount. 28 Birds to be culled to control disease spread must be culled as soon as possible. Birds must be culled in such a way as to minimise the risk of the onward spread of disease. In very li mited circumstances and subject to a veterinary risk assessment , birds may be moved from the premises (e.g. to a slaughterhouse) to be culled. Samples may be taken as directed by expert epidemiological opinion. Welfare of birds to be culled is an important consideration and is subject to strict legal controls. 124 For large poultry (including game birds and other poultry species) premises, gassing of birds is the preferred option, either by containerised gassing units or whole house gassing (where poultry houses are suitable and the technology is available). Other forms of proven gas delivery systems would also be considered where the premises are suitable. Ventilation shutdown may be considered where there is no practical alternative and there is a threat to public health. Ventilation shutdown is a method of last resort when consideration of all other methods has been exhausted. It is only permitted in England. 125 For smaller numbers of birds (e.g. a backyard flock, keepers who identify themselves as hobbyists , kee pers of poultry as pets or for a small collection of other captive birds) or for larger or flightless birds, individual techniques such as neck dislocation, percussion/electrical stunning or lethal injection may be more appropriate. Maceration may be used for day old chicks. Compensation and valuation Compensation 126 In line with the Animal Health Act 1981 (as amended) , government 's policy on compensation for NAD is as follows: For poultry or other captive birds not diseased at the time of killing, compensation is payable at the value of the birds immediately before killing. For poultry or other captive birds dead or diseased at the time of killing, no compensation is payable. 127 The following principles also apply: Only poultry or other captive birds killed unde r orders from government can be compensated for. APHA makes an assessment of the disease status of the poultry (including game birds and poultry kept as pets) or other captive birds, based on clinical 29 inspection and veterinary judgment of the number of birds considered to be affected with the disease for which they are being killed. The assessment is made shortly before the killing of birds at the IP begins. Compensation will be paid for other things that have to be seized by government (for example eggs t hat have not originated from the IP but may have been subsequently exposed to the virus in a hatchery) because they pose a risk of transmitting disease and cannot be cleansed and disinfected. This will be at the value of the item at the time of seizure (and could mean that the item has very little or even no value if it is considered contaminated following a VRA). Compensation is not paid for eggs or poultry meat that are required to be disposed of at the IP or following trace investigations from an IP (as they are from affected birds) (see paragraphs 129-131 and 144-148). This also applies to any carcases of birds that have died before culling has commenced. Compensation is not paid for consequential losses, including business interruption caused by control measures, for example losses due to movement bans or lost sales opportunities. Any money received from an insurance policy that covers compensated loss as a result of disease, will be subtracted from compensation paid by government , or if already paid then must be reimbursed. Valuation 128 Determination of the value of poultry (including game birds and poultry kept as pets) and other captive birds will be carried out by one of the following methods: Valuation by APHA using a valuation rate card - this is the default option where this is available for the species and type of bird to be killed. These rate cards are updated periodically . If a rate card is not available, APHA may commi ssion a new generic rate card. The new cards are added to our library and if still relevant, can be used in future outbreaks. Exceptionally APHA may consider a request by a keeper to use a bespoke valuation commissioned by the keeper, where they feel the birds are not commercial and are particularly rare. T his option would also apply to primary breeding stock. This valuation will need to be accompanied by full details (including photographs) of the age and breed of poultry . APHA may appoint an independent valuer who is suitably qualified and experienced to review this valuation Specialist poultry consultants / valuers - these are used when no other method of valuation is possible. 30 Disposal 129 APHA is responsible for the disposal of carcases of birds culled for disease control purposes. 130 Where there are other carcases (birds that have died before the cull), poultry meat, table and hatching eggs on the IP, which have been produced from susceptible animals originating at the IP, these must be disposed of by the owner/occupier and compensation is not payable to the producer. These products must be disposed of in a bio- secure manner (following liaison with the APHA vet at the IP) and in compliance with Animal By -Products Regulations at a designated disposal facility. 131 Further information about disposal is available in government 's exotic disease contingency plans ( Defra's Contingency Plan for Exotic Diseases of Animals , Scottish Government's Exotic Animal Disease Contingency Framework Plan and the Welsh Government Contingency Plan for Exotic Animal Diseases ). Initial (preliminary) cleansing and disinfection 132 Initial (also referred to as preliminary) C&D is undertaken by APHA and funded by government , to limit the spread of virus . Once infected birds at the IP have been culled, production of the virus ceases but can remain viable for several months in water, faecal material and on hard surfaces . APHA therefore spray disinfectant on: All parts of the premises (other than parts where disinfectants would have no effect, such as fields). All equipment which poultry (including game birds, other poultry species or poultry kept as pets ) or other captive birds have had access to. Any contaminated material remaining at the IP (e.g. litter or bedding ). Anything contaminated during killing. 133 This initial C&D is important as its completion is taken into account in determining the minimum length of time disease control zones (see paragraphs 174-176 and 177-178) will remain in place. Secondary cleansing and disinfection 134 NAD virus es naturally take time to decay, depending on various factors (e.g. exposure to the elements, temperature, humidity etc.) and will likely persist following initial C&D. Therefore, before resuming poultry production further cleansing and disinfection is required by the owner/keeper at their expense to a 31 satisfactory standard, and signed- off by government. However, the owner/keeper can choose not to undertake secondary C&D and opt to cease all poultry production on the infected premises for at least 12 months. The following are the 3 options available to the owner or keeper after initial C&D - note that all processes need to be agreed and \"signed off\" with APHA : a) undertake final C&D process4; or b) undertake C&D to the OIE standard of disinfection set out in the OIE Terrestrial Code5, or c) opt not to undertake any form of poultry production for 12 months, and make the site biosecure (including controlling vermin and deterring wild birds) for 12 months. 135 Where a n owner/ keeper opts to undertake secondary C&D, a written plan for the work is completed by the owner/ keeper and agreed with APHA , setting out in detail how the various actions will be carried out and which approved disinfectants will be used. APHA will also sign a certificate of final C&D once works have been completed by the owner or keeper . A certificate of final C&D will be signed a by APHA once works have been completed by the owner or keeper 136 The final C&D process involves degreasing cleansing, and disinfecting, and then repeating the process one week later to ensure t hat any NAD virus on the premises is eliminated as far as possible. 137 After final C&D the infected premises can be restocked with sentinel birds . If final C&D is not undertaken (see paragraph 134 ) the premises can be repopulated with birds 12 months from when preliminary disinfection had been completed (sentinel restocking not required). Restocking of depopulated premises 138 The restocking of commercial poultry (including game birds and other poultry species) holdings is not permitted until at least 21 days after final C&D has been completed to the satisfaction of APHA (see paragraphs 134-137) or 12 months following initial C&D. 4 The trigger for OIE country freedom can be achieved earlier if the OIE standard of disinfection is met, as part of the final C&D. 5Where OIE disinfection standard C&D have been undertaken, the owner/keeper may be allowed on a case- by-case basis to undertake alternative activities on the restricted premises, subject to a veterinary risk assessment. The premises will still remain under restriction for 12 months following initial C&D. 32 139 Where sentinel restocking is undertaken, birds usually have to be introduced at normal stocking rate . Any variation to this needs to be agreed with APHA. Restrictions will remain in place until it is certain that there is no recurrence of disease. During the 21 days following r estocking after final C &D, poultry (including game birds and other poultry species) will undergo official examination by an APHA vet. Sampling for laboratory testing may be carried out. Restrictions on the premises will remain in place until at least the completion of the followin g: Clinical surveillance showing no evidence of infection. Any samples taken have returned negative test results for the relevant disease. For ND, any birds used for repopulation must be fully vaccinated against the disease. 140 For an IP that is not a commercial poultry premises, the principles described in this section will normally apply: a VRA by APHA will determine any deviation from this position. Confirmation of notifiable avian disease in a slaughterhouse 141 The above sections do not apply in relation to c onfirmation of NAD at a slaughterhouse. In the event of NAD being confirmed, the isolated carcases (i.e. those from infected poultry (including game birds, pet hens and other poultry species) , poultry from the same premises or carcases potentially contamin ated during the killing/production process) will be destroyed under official supervision. The slaughterhouse owner/operator will be required to carry out C&D of the parts of the slaughterhouse that may be contaminated (e.g. areas used for culling or storag e) in accordance with instructions from the APHA vet . The premises of origin will be traced and an investigation carried out to determine what action is required, including depopulation if appropriate and further actions as applicable to an IP, including t racing. 142 As stated in paragraphs 93-98, in the time following the submission of samples, if the occupier completes C&D in accordance with instructions from APHA (i.e. of areas potentially contaminated by infected poultry or poultry carcases), live poultry may be allowed to enter the slaughterhouse again for slaughter. 33 Tracing and contact premises 143 Assessing the risk of any potential spread of NAD from the IP and the likely source of disease is a vital task in ensuring that the disease is stamped out as quickly as possible. Tracing of poultry (including game birds , other poultry species and poultry kept as pets) meat and eggs from an infected premises 144 There are legal requirements for the tracing of poultry (including game birds , other poultry species and poultry kept as pets ) meat and eggs from an IP, which vary according to the form of NAD confirmed. Within the flexibility of this framework, tracing will be carried out at the direction of the relevant CVO. 145 FSA advice is that neither AI nor ND pose a food safety risk for consumers if poultry (including game birds, other poultry species and poultry kept as pets ) meat and eggs are properly handled and prepared. Tracing therefore has the rationale of closing down potential pathways of the spread of NAD virus to poultry, other captive birds or wild birds to protect animal health. 146 In the event of NAD being confirmed at premises, the following activities will be carried out: Tracing of hatching eggs from poultry laid during the unregulated period of infection (see Annex 1 - Glossary of Terms ). Tracing of poultry hatched from eggs laid during that period. Additionally, for HPAI and ND, tracing of poultry meat and table eggs may be carried out. 147 Given the nature of, and clinical signs associated with HPAI and ND (e.g. high mortality, drop in egg production), the ante and post -mortem checks that take place at slaughterhouses and the nature of the production systems in question, it is considered unlikely that either diseased birds/eggs from diseased birds will have been dispatched from the farm of origin, or poultry meat or eggs from an IP will enter the food supply chain. Tracing will be carried out at the direction of the relevant CVO; however , given the factors listed above it is unlikely that tracing will require the withdrawal of poultry meat and eggs beyond the primary processing stage (e.g. cutting plant, egg packing centre). 148 The following list summarises th e activities that must be carried out where poultry meat or eggs are traced. In the event of disposal of poultry meat and eggs being required, they must be disposed of in a bio- secure manner at the expense of the 34 owner in compliance with Animal By -Products Regulations at a designated disposal facility. Compensation is not paid (See paragraphs 126-127). Requirements where poultry meat and eggs are traced from an IP by NAD HPAI o Poultry meat Must be disposed of by person in possession of it o Table eggs Must be disposed of by person in possession of them or moved directly to an egg processing plant o Hatching eggs laid during the unregulated period of infection Must be disposed of by person in possess ion of them o Poultry hatched from eggs laid during the unregulated period of infection Poultry placed under official surveillance and not allowed to move off the premises for at least 21 days LPAI o Poultry meat No requirements for tracing o Table eggs No requirements for tracing o Hatching eggs laid during the unregulated period of infection Veterinary enquiries carried out at premises, as considered necessary by a VRA o Poultry hatched from eggs laid during the unregulated period of infection Veterinary enquiries carried out at premises, as considered necessary by a VRA ND o Poultry meat Must be disposed of by person in possession of it o Table eggs Must be disposed of by person in possession of them or moved directly to an egg processing plant o Hatching eggs laid during the unregulated period of infection Must be disposed of by person in possession of them o Poultry hatched from eggs laid during the unregulated period of infection 35 Poultry placed under official surveillance and not allowed to move off the premises for at least 21 days Contact premises and other suspect cases Assessing and classifying contact premises 149 As detailed in paragraphs 84-85, an epidemiological investigation is initiated when premises are declared suspect premises. Upon confirmation of NAD, such inquiries are critical in determining where the disease is most likely to have originated and where it may have spread. Premises considered as a possible source or place to which disease may have spread are regarded as contacts . A level of risk is attributed to the contact based upon many factors, including: Nature of epidemiological link (e.g. movement of live poultry (including game birds and poultry kept as pets), movement of people or movement of vehicles between premises). Species, type of premises and levels of biosecurity (e.g. broiler farm, feed mill, slaughterhouse). Frequency of contact and time since that contact (e.g. daily, one- off). Level of infection on the confirmed premises (e.g. all poultry showing clinical signs or only one shed affected, outside stock only). 150 The level of risk can generally be classified a s one of the following: High risk contact - where the link between premises identified is of sufficient magnitude that the disease is very likely to have spread either to or from that premises. Two examples of high risk events are the movement of poultry at a time when the disease was considered to be present or the movement of personnel who do not practice good biosecurity (e.g. farm workers who work on two separate premises and travel frequently between them without practi cing good biosecurity). Medium ri sk contact - where the link identified is not of the same magnitude as for high risk but there is a common link between premises. A typical medium risk event is the movement of personnel between farms at a time when the disease was considered to be present but they undertook good biosecurity with regards to footwear and overalls. An example of good biosecurity is only to visit one poultry farm per day and to use protective clothing and footwear provided by that farm. Low risk contact - where the link identi fied is not of the same magnitude for medium risk but there is a common link between premises. A typical low risk event is the movement of a person who does not enter the areas where the 36 poultry are kept (i.e. inside the pens within buildings or fields) between farms at a time when the disease was considered to be present. 151 Once identified, all contact premises will be treated as potential suspect premises and subject to the restrictions and measures detailed in paragraph 76. 152 Birds at \"high- risk\" contact premises (referred to as dangerous contacts ) may be pre-emptively culled on the basis of a VRA. In such circumstances samples will be taken from culled birds (on a statistical basis) for laboratory analysis to determine whether the virus was present on the premises. If laboratory results confirm NAD infection, the premises is declared as an IP and therefore subject to the measures laid down in paragraphs 113-142 and 143-154. Zones will also be declared accordingly (see paragraphs 155-184). If laboratory results do not confirm NAD infection, there may still be a risk that infection is present and subsequent actions (e.g. time before restrictions are lifted, the degree of secondary C&D required) will be based on a VRA. The principles outlined in paragraphs 126-128 apply with respect to compensation. 153 In the case of \"medium and low -risk\" contact premises, the premises are restricted and put under surveillance for a period of time (normally 21 days from the date of last contact), during which samples may be taken for testing. Other suspected cases 154 Notification of suspected NAD during an existing outbreak (other than contact premises identified through earlier epidemiological enquiries) will be investigated. If the premises is not a contact premises, the procedures outlined in paragraphs 76-101 will be followed. 37 Disease control zones General principles 155 In addition to controls at the IP, zones are usually put in place depending on the disease in question and in accordance with relevant legislation. Paragraphs 193- 198 describe the circumstances in which deviation from this policy position may be considered. Within these zones, restrictions are placed on premises containing poultry (including game birds and poultry kept as pets) or captive birds. Movements of poultry , other captive birds and other things likely to transmit disease to, from and within the zone are also liable to be subject to restrictions. Again, the rationale behind these measures is to minimise the risk of onward spread of disease to other birds in the vicinity and to rapidly establish whether this already occurred prior to confirmation at the initial IP. Poultry or other captive birds at such premises within the zones may be subject to inspection or examination by a n APHA vet . Cross -border zones in Great Britain 156 When disease is confirmed, the government will establish zone(s) using the IP as a centre within their administration (first country). In the event of an IP being close to a border and where legislation requires that the zone be extended beyond this border, the relevant government is responsible for declaring the zone within their administration (second country). There will be close dialogue between each affected administration to discuss, and agree where possible, on the measures to be declared if zones straddle the Welsh- English or the Scottish -English border. Close communication is maintained throughout the outbreak to ensure consistency of approach and measures wherever possible (e.g. the issuing and conditions of movement licenses , the ending of zones). 157 In such events where zones are imposed up to borders but are not required to extend further (e.g. in the case of a prevention zone), there will be close dialogue between each affected administration to discuss the extent of the zones. Any decisions on extending zones beyond borders (or not) will be based on an assessment of the risk of disease spread and also a consideration of any potential economic implications of movement controls. Size of zones 158 European legislative requirements determine the minimum size of and measures within zones (see tabl e following paragraphs 177-178). Expert advice regarding measures within the zones and their size is sought during the course of an outbreak as more information regarding the disease situation becomes available. If further IPs are confirmed, zones are reshaped (if the IP occurs in existing zones) or newly established (if the I P occurs outside existing zones). 38 Types of zones Zones used dependant on disease type: AI of subtype H5 or H7 (N -type and pathogenicity not yet confirmed) o Temporary control zone (TCZ) o Temporary movement restriction zone (TMRZ) HPAI (except H5N1 in poultry ) o Protection zone (PZ) o Surveillance zone (SZ) HPAI H5N1 in poultry o Protection zone (PZ) o Surveillance zone (SZ) o Restricted zone (RZ) LPAI o Low pathogenic restricted zone (LPAI RZ) Newcastle Disease o Protection zone (PZ) o Surveillance zone (SZ) 159 Details of the principles, measures and requirements within each of the zones are detailed in paragraphs 177-178. Avian influenza of subtype H5/H7 confirmed (N-type and pathogenicity not yet confirmed) 160 When laboratory tests confirm AI of the subtype H5 or H7 but the virus N -type and pathogenicity have not been confirmed, area restrictions may be put in place. 161 If expert opinion is that the virus present on the premises is likely to be HPAI H5N1, two temporary zones (in the form of a TCZ and a TMRZ) will be declared. The following factors will be taken into account when deciding on the extent of the two zones: The results of veterinary enquiries at the IP. The geographical features of the area around the IP. The location and proximity of other poultry premises in the area. 39 Patterns of movements and trade in poultry and other captive birds in the area. The facilities and personnel available to control movements within the zone. 162 Legislation requires that the TCZ must have a radius of at least 10km centred on the IP. 163 If expert opinion is that the virus is not likely to be HPAI H5N1, the appropriate zones will be applied when the pathogenicity has been confirmed and temporary zones will not normally be declared. In exceptional circumstances, when expert opinion is that it is necessary to reduce the risk of spread of avian influenza fro m the IP, a TCZ could be declared. This would generally be equivalent to the zone that would be applied if disease were confirmed. A TMRZ could also be declared (generally equivalent to an RZ - see paragraphs 166-167) but it is also considered that this is highly unlikely to be necessary given past experience of HPAI outbreaks in GB. 164 Once further laboratory tests confirm the N -type and pathogenicity, the principles in the relevant subsequent sections apply (i.e. paragraph 165 if highly pathogenic, paragraphs 166-167 if HPAI H5N1 , or paragraphs 168-171 if low pathogenic). Highly pathogenic avian influenza confirmed 165 A PZ and SZ will be declared. Legislation also provides powers for government to declare a wider RZ if deemed necessary to reduce the risk of the spread of HPAI. Given past experience of HPAI outbreaks in GB, it is unlikely that an RZ would be declared for such outbreaks (other than HPA I H5N1 - see paragraphs 166-167). Highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 confirmed in poultry 166 A PZ, SZ and RZ will be declared. Unlike as detailed in paragraph 165, it is a requirement under European legislation that an RZ is declared. 167 Flexibility is available in terms of the size of the RZ; however, the EC will review and approve the measures imposed. In GB, the size of the zone will be based on expert advice and the emerging epidemiological situation. The RZ's size and associated measures may be refined as further evidence becomes available (e.g. expert ornithological advice). Low pathogenic avian influenza confirmed 168 A LPAI RZ will be declared. 169 Outbreaks of LPAI can bring with them their own particular set of issues. Given that the infected birds may have shown no clinical signs of disease, it is possible that detection will have been delayed, increasing the possibility of spread during the unregulated period of infection. This is especially true for non- commercial poultry (including poultry kept as pets) premises. Such circumstances increase the importance of tracing and surveillance activities carried out by APHA. 40 170 Legislation allows for certain measures in the zone to be removed based on VR A concluding that disease control would not be jeopardised. However, such discretion would only be considered in highly favourable epidemiological circumstances - i.e. a VRA concluded that the origin of the disease had been established and that the risk of spread had been assessed as negligible. 171 Widespread LPAI outbreaks have occurred in other EU MSs, caused by spread prior to detection and incursions of wild birds spreading the virus to domestic poultry . Newcastle disease confirmed 172 If ND is confirmed (or P PMV -1 is confirmed in poultry ), a PZ and SZ will be declared. Surveillance within the zones 173 Legislation determines the level of surveillance for further cases of NAD carried out within the zones in order to rapidly establish if disease has spread. This is carried out in addition to the tracing activities described in paragraphs 143-154. The following key principles apply in disease control zones (except the RZ declared for HPAI H5N1 in poultry ): Premises within the zone containing poultry ((including game birds and poultry kept as pets) and, depending on legal requirements, other captive birds) will be identified as soon as possible. Such premises are initially identified using the GBPR and other sources of data. Such premises may be subject to visits by APHA. During visits, poultry (and, depending on legal requirements, other captive birds) may be examined. If NAD is suspected, the principles and measures described in paragraph 76 will apply. Visits are prioritised according to the type of premises (e.g. large commercial premises) and associated risk factors (e.g. proximity to IP; outdoor/free- range units). Several visits may be made over the course of an outbreak. The relevant local authority/authorities (and SG Rural Payments and Inspec tions Directorate in Scotland) play a key role in carrying out foot patrols to ensure that the requirements within the zone are understood and in enforcing these. In addition, for outbreaks of LPAI, testing at commercial poultry premises within 1km of the IP will be carried out as a minimum. 41 Duration of zones 174 Legislation determines the minimum duration of zones in terms of the time elapsed since the completion of initial C&D at the IP within the zone (see the table after paragraphs 177-178). In the event of multiple IP within a zone, this duration relates to the time elapsed since initial C&D was completed at the last premises to undergo this procedure. 175 In addition to this minimum requirement, a zone will not be ended if suspect premises remain (see paragraphs 76-101) within the zone at which veterinary inquiries are ongoing or for which laboratory results are pending. 176 The following principles also apply: A TCZ and TMRZ become permanent zones on receipt of results from further confirmatory laboratory tests. A PZ becomes part of the wider SZ when ended. When an SZ or RZ is ended, area controls will cease to apply. Measures within zones 177 The table below summarises the key measures that will apply in the relevant disease control zone: the Declaration (for AI) or Declaratory Order (for ND) will detail the exact requirements within the zone(s). 178 In addition, the following key principles apply: Powers exist for additional measures to be imposed if deemed necessary to reduce the risk of disease spread. These are only likely to be considered in the event of the failure of the standard measures described in the table below or in the event of delayed detectio n of disease. Government policy is to keep the countryside open for business as far as possible during a disease outbreak. In relation to measures under which movements are subject to licence, see paragraphs 228-241. 42 Measures and restrictions within disease control zones Type of NAD confirmed HPAI HPAI H5N1 in 10 3 10 N/A 1 3 10 Minimum number of days in place since initial C&D at IP 21 30 21 30 307 21 21 30 Record keeping Y Y Y Y Y N N N Housing or isolation Y Y 8 Y Y 6 *9 N Y N Movement restrictions - poultry Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Movement restrictions - other captive birds Y Y Y Y Y Y Y N Movement restrictions - mammals Y Y Y Y N Y N N Movement restrictions - eggs Y Y Y Y Y 10 Y Y Y 8 Movement restrictions - poultry meat/carcases Y N Y N N N Y N Movement restrictions - bird by products N N Y Y Y N N N Movement restrictions - wild game products N N Y Y Y N N N Restrictions - poultry litter, manure and slurry Y Y Y Y N Y Y Y Requirements - fresh meat and meat products N N Y Y Y N N N Biosecurity Y Y Y Y N Y Y N Ban on bird gatherings Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Ban on the release of game birds Y Y Y Y N Y N N 6 Declaration of a TCZ in the case of HPAI and LPAI would only be considered in exceptional circumstances. 7 The RZ will be removed at the same time as the SZ, in line with European requirements . 8 This will be based on expert ornit hological opinion. 9 If a housing/isolation requirement is imposed in the SZ, this may be considered appropriate for the RZ and will be informed by a VRA. 10 Restrictions only on hatching eggs. 43 Key: Record keeping: movements of poultry , eggs and visitors (the latter to/from premises where poultry or other captive birds are kept). Housing or isolation: poultry and other captive birds must be kept in their buildings or kept isolated from other poultry /captive birds and wild birds. Products of free range flocks that are required to be housed can retain their free range status, provided the housed period does not exceed 12 weeks on a flock -by-flock basis for poultrymeat as set out in Commission Regulation 543/2008, or 16 weeks on a fl ock-by-flock for eggs as set out in Commission Regulation 589/2008 (see the guidance on GOV.UK for further information). The exemption does not apply in situations where the owner voluntarily decides to house their birds. The biosecurity guidance on GOV.UK includes advice on how to protect your birds from wild birds when housing is not possible. Movement restrictions : movements of the things listed are subject to restrictions. Restrictions - poultry litter, manure and slurry : cannot be removed from premises or spread except under licence. Requirements - fresh meat and meat products : requirements relating to marking, sourc ing, cutting, transportation and storage will be in place. Biosecurity : appropriate measures must be put in place for people entering or leaving premises where poultry , other captive birds or eggs are kept. Ban on bird gatherings : bird gatherings are not permitted within the zone. Ban on the release of game birds : the release of game birds is not permitted within the zone. 44 Firebreak cull 179 Additional powers exist for the control of NAD outbreaks in the form of the culling of any poultry (including game birds and poultry kept as pets) required to prevent disease spread. This is termed a preventive or firebreak cull and would aim to prevent further spread of disease to poultry in an area around IP. Such a cull has not been used in outbreaks of NAD to date in GB and it is unlikely that such measures would be required to control outbreaks of NAD virus circulating worldwide at present. In experiences of outbreaks of NAD in GB to date, other measures described up to this point in the control strategy have been successful in stamping out the disease. Therefore such measures would only be considered if these strategies were failing to control disease spread. 180 Government would be required to publish a slaughter protocol prior to carrying out a firebreak cull in England or Wales. The power cannot be used unless the protocol has been published and vaccination has first been considered to prevent the spread of disease. Separate arrangements exist in Scotland in relation to exercising such powers, including the making of a statement by Scottish Ministers. Controls outside zones General 181 Legislation does not require any specific controls outside the declared zones, although as described in paragraphs 149-154, contact premises will be identified and these may be located outside existing control zones. Bird gatherings 182 Any decision to impose wider controls on bird gatherings outside of disease contr ol zones will be based on the disease situation and an assessment of risk. Communication 183 Throughout the various stages of a disease outbreak, steps are taken locally and regionally to ensure that all (and especially those in charge of poultry (including game birds and poultry kept as pets) or other captive birds) are made aware of the restrictions and requirements in force in the area. In conjunction with key stakeholders and other bodies representing keepers of poultry or other captive birds, government will deliver a communications programme to inform keepers/owners of poultry and other captive birds, veterinarians and other stakeholders of: The disease situation. The measures being implemented within zones. The need for vigilance for and prompt reporting of clinical signs of disease in birds. 45 The need to maintain strict biosecurity. 184 Communication methods will vary according to the messages required. For example, signs must be displayed by APHA in and around IP. Premises on the GBPR will be not ified of any restrictions or the need for increased vigilance and an appraisal of biosecurity measures on site. Members of the public can sign up to receive such updates through the APHA subscription service. The GOV.UK website will also be updated regularly to reflect the changing disease situation and measures being implemented within control zones. Each affected administration will have overall control of all communications for an outbreak in their country. 46 Derogations Derogation from culling birds Avian influenza 185 Limited derogation exists that would allow birds to be spared from culling at the IP on certain types of premises only (listed below). This is subject to a VRA. Types of premises at which derogation may be considered: Non-commercial premises. Circuses. Zoos. Pet shops. Wildlife parks. Fenced areas where poultry or other captive birds are kept for scientific purposes or for purposes related to the conservation of endangered species. Premises or parts of premises where only breeds of poultry or other captive birds that are considered rare are kept (see below). 186 This will only be considered if a VRA concludes that disease control is not threatened by exercising this discretion. Factors taken into account when making such a decision include: W hether the AI virus at the IP is of high or low pathogenicity. Whether the birds in question are infected or not. The biosecurity arrangements that can be put in place at the IP to minimise the risk of onward spread of the AI virus. The trade implications of not imposing a stamping out policy (i.e. culling and C&D). 187 The UK Breeds at Risk List has been compiled by the Farm Animal Genetic Resources (FAnGR) Committee. FAnGR is a UK Government committee with participation from the Devolved Administrations which provides advice to government on all issues relating to farm animal genetic resources, particularly its conservation and sustainable use. 188 If the derogation is applied, birds must be brought indoors or isolated, and kept in such a way that they do not have contact with other poultry (including game birds and poultry kept as pets) or other captive birds. Similar steps must also be taken to minimise contact with wild birds. 47 189 Birds not culled will be subject to further surveillance and testing and not be allowed to move off the premises (unless licensed) until laboratory tests indicate that they no longer pose a risk to the further spread of the AI v irus. Newcastle disease 190 In relation to ND, the principles and approach to that described above for AI will be adopted wherever possible. Pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 191 If PPMV -1 is confirmed in pigeons, the default position is that pigeons are not culled. Restrictions imposed on suspicion (see paragraph 83) will remain in place on the premises until clinical signs of disease no longer exist. At this point, where live (p otentially recovered) pigeons remain on the premises, restrictions will be maintained for a further 60 days after the disappearance of clinical signs of the disease. 192 APHA will advise the owner/keeper that they should inform anyone whose pigeons may have recently mixed with the infected pigeons. This will alert others to the existence of disease and to increase their vigilance for clinical signs of disease in their birds. Derogation from declaring control zones Highly pathogenic avian influenza 193 If HPAI is co nfirmed in a hatchery, there is provision for flexibility in terms of declaring zones as described in paragraphs 155-184. Similarly, the declaration of zones is likely not to be required in the event of confirmation of NAD in a slaughterhouse. In both cases, a VRA will inform the action taken. The premises of origin will be traced and an investigation carried out to determine what action is required, including depopulation if appropriate and further actions as applicable to an IP, including tracing. 194 If HPAI is confirmed at a premises listed below, derogation exists in relation to the measures imposed within the zones. Types of premises at which derogation may be considered: Non-commercial premises. Circuses. Zoos. Pet shops. Wildlife parks. Fenced areas where poultry or other captive birds are kept for scientific purposes or for purposes related to the conservation of endangered species. 48 Premises or parts of premises where only breeds of poultry or other captive birds which are considered rare are kept. 195 In the case of HPAI, the default position is that zones are declared as per paragraphs 155-184. Any decision to deviate from this position would be based on a VRA that concluded that the origin of the disease had been established and that the risk of spread had been assessed as negligible. Newcast le disease 196 In relation to ND, the principles and approach to that described above for AI will be adopted wherever possible. Low pathogenic avian influenza 197 If LPAI is confirmed in a hatchery or in poultry or other captive birds at a type of premises listed in paragraphs 193-195, legislation allows for flexibility in terms of declaring a zone (and the measures within as described in paragraphs 155-184). In reaching such a decision, the principles in paragraphs 193-195 apply. Pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 198 Zones are not declared for outbreaks of PPMV -1 in pigeons or other captive birds. 49 Emergency Vaccination 199 Vaccination is not recommended for the control of LPAI or HPAI. Stamping out is the most effective means of controlling an outbreak. For preventive vaccination, see paragraphs 53-61. Avian influenza European legislation 200 European legislation allows MSs to introduce emergency vaccination in poultry or other captive birds as a short term measure to contain an outbreak when a risk assessment indicates there is a significant and immediate threat of AI spreading within or into a MS. If emergency vaccination were to be introduced in GB, a plan would need to be submitted to the EC for approval. Government's position 201 Vaccination is not a routine control measure and is a practice restricted by legislation. Vaccination of poultry (including game birds and poultry kept as pets) or other captive birds is not the most effective defence against outbreaks of AI: outbreaks in GB to date have been stamped out through application of the control measures detailed in paragraphs 76-101, 113-142, 143-154 and 155-184. Scenarios 202 Emergency vaccination in GB is not recommended as a means of controlling an outbreak. However, this strategy may be reconsidered by experts if there is a significant change in the epidemiology of AI in reservoir populations. In these circumstances it may be prudent to vaccina te poultry at risk. Monitoring and surveillance, including a \"Differentiate Infected from Vaccinated Animals\" (DIVA) strategy with stamping out of infected vaccinated birds, would need to be put in place and carried out intensively if the virus is to be er adicated. An exit strategy would be put in place accordingly. Newcastle disease 203 Vaccines for ND with marketing authorisations are commercially available and bird owners can choose whether or not to vaccinate their birds. Under legislation there is provision for the imposition of a compulsory vaccination zone in the event of an outbreak. At present, government cannot foresee circumstances under which we would declare such a zone for an outbreak of ND. Instead, communications will highlight the availability of vaccine against the disease. Any consideration of compulsory vaccination would be based on a VRA and other factors, such as the density of poultry farms in the area and the disease situation. 50 Avian influenza: pigs and other mammals Overview 204 Birds and many mammals can be infected with influenza A virus. From time to time, influenza viruses evolve into new strains of influenza. This can happen within species or through the mixing of viruses from different species. Pigs have been described as possible 'mixing vessels' for the various influenza virus strains. 205 Swine influenza is largely endemic in most pig producing countries, including the UK. Swine influenza is not notifiable; however a voluntary code of practice is in place covering the prevention and control of influenza in pigs. 206 The viruses that cause AI (i.e. of H5 and H7 subtypes) are not known to circulate in pigs, although they could in theory become infected with these strains. Ot her influenza viruses of avian origin - H1 and H3 subtypes - have entered pig populations and circulated. 207 The aim of the controls described in this section is to minimise the risk of pigs acting as agents for further evolution or spread of influenza viruses (including viruses causing AI) to other species including humans. Avian influenza confirmed at infected premises where pigs are kept 208 In cases where AI is confirmed in poultry (including game birds and poultry kept as pets) or other captive birds and pigs are kept at the IP, the pigs will be tested for infection with the virus. This can also be applied to other mammals on the IP. Testing will be carried out as soon as possible after confirmation of the disease in poultry and then again 21 days after the date of culling of the poultry or other captive birds. No action will be taken if both these sets of results are negative. However, the movement of pigs off the premises will already have been restricted (see paragraph 83) and such restrictions are likely to remain in place until the latter set of laboratory results confirm that AI virus is not present in the pig herd. 209 If the same virus is confirmed in pigs, powers exist for the culling of infected animals or those exposed to the virus. Action in the event of such an occurrence would be assessed on a case- by-case basis, drawing on expert opinion, both from a veterinary and human health perspective. Government w ould where possible seek to implement measures in line with the principles of the code of practice in place for the prevention and control of influenza in pigs ; however, culling cannot be ruled out. Suspect influenza in pigs 210 Pig owners/keepers' private vets can routinely submit samples to the APHA or Scottish Agricultural College for swine influenza testing. 51 Influenza A virus of avian origin confirmed in pigs not at an existing infected premises 211 The confirmation in pigs of influenza A virus of avian origin occurs through an unexpected isolation of the virus reported from laboratory testing as described in paragraph 210. The APHA must be informed of such an occurrence. In such cases, the disease control approach will follow the principles detailed in paragraphs 208-209. Preventing avian influenza in wild birds from transmitting to pigs 212 If HPAI H5N1 is confirmed in wild birds (see paragraphs 214-227) near to a pig unit, a VRA may be carried out which would provide the basis for advice given to keepers of outdoor pigs in the area. Such advice is likely to reinforce messages of increased vigilance for cli nical signs of disease, prompt reporting of disease and vigilance for any diseased or dead wild birds in the vicinity. Other measures aimed at minimising contact between pigs and wild birds have not been necessary to date in outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 in wild birds in GB. Any consideration of such measures will take into account the epidemiological situation at the time, the transmissibility of the virus in question and the risk of reassortment. Preventing avian influenza in poultry (including game birds, other poultry species and poultry kept as pets) or other captive birds from transmitting to pigs and other mammals 213 Powers are available to declare an AI (Restrictions on Mammals) Zone, allowing any measures deemed necessary to control disease spread to be implemented. These could include testing of pigs or other mammals for influenza virus causing AI, restrictions on the movements of pigs and other mammals or requirements for enhanced biosecurity or the housing of pigs or other mammals. Such measures have not been necessary to date in outbreaks of AI in GB. Any consideration of such measures will take into account the epidemiological situation at the time, the transmissibility of the virus in question and the risk of reassortment. 52 Highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 in wild birds Confirming highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 in wild birds 214 If HPAI H5N1 is confirmed in a wild bird or wild bird carcase, requirements under European legislation apply. If other subtypes of AI are found in w ild birds, it is the default position that no action will be taken. If action is considered, this will be based on expert opinion, ornithological advice and consideration of trade implications. 215 Communication to owners/keepers of poultry (including game birds and poultry kept as pets) or other captive birds emphasising the need for increased vigilance for clinical sings of AI and industry -led initiatives would be considered prior to any government intervention. Culling of wild birds 216 It is not current policy to cull wild birds, although powers exist to do this. The control of AI infection in wild bird populations is not feasible from a logistical, environmental and biodiversity perspective. Indiscriminate culling of wild migratory bird populations is unlikely to be effective in preventing further spread of AI, and their hunting would likely cause the dispersion of the birds. At present, we cannot foresee circumstances that would lead to a change in this policy, although this position will be assessed on a case- by-case basis. General principles 217 Legislation provides for controlled areas around the location of the confirmed case of HPAI H5N1 (i.e. the location from which the wild bird/wild bird carcase was collected). Measures implemented have the aim of preventing the spread of the disease to poultry or other captive birds and are put in place through the declaration of disease control areas: the default position is that a wild bird control area (WBCA) and wild bird monitoring area (WBMA) are declared. Size of a reas 218 Legal requirements determine the minimum size of disease control areas. Expert ornithological advice regarding measures within the areas and their size is sought during the course of an outbreak as more information regarding the disease situation becomes available. If further infected wild birds/carcases are confirmed, areas are reshaped (if the wild bird/carcase was collected from an existing area) or newly established (if the wild bird/carcase was collected outside existing areas). 53 219 Legislation allows for the size and shape of the areas to be based on an assessment of the risk of disease spreading to poultry or other captive birds. This means that there is scope for each outbreak to be assessed throughout its duration and treated accordingly on a case- by-case basis. Expert ornithological advice will be drawn upon throughout the outbreak. Factors taken into account in the size of the declared areas will include: Geographical features. Administrative boundaries (e.g. county or unitary council boundaries). Those relating to the water environment in the locality. Ecological factors. The extent of the outbreak. Monitoring facilities. Location/extent of poultry (including game birds and poultry kept as pets) and other captive bird populations. 220 There may be limited circumstances under which zones may not be declared. The following conditions have to be satisfied through a VRA: That the virus is not present in poultry , other captive birds or wild birds in the area. That the wild bird or carcase did not present a risk of spreading the virus to these birds in that area. 221 This could be considered, for example, when evidence suggests that the affected wild bird was not resident to the area where its carcase was found and therefore the declaration of control areas would not be a proportionate or effective response. Surveillance within zones 222 The principles and surveillance activities listed in paragraph 173 apply. Duration of zones 223 The WBCA is usually in place for at least 21 days following the date of collection of the samples from the infected wild bird, at which point it becomes part of the WBMA. Its duration will take account of surveillance in the area showing that there is no disease present in poultry (including game birds and poultry kept as pets) or other captive birds. Under legislation, there is , however , scope for the collapsing of the WBCA prior to 21 days. This can only be considered following a favourable VRA and the completion of surveillance activities listed in paragraph 173. This will not occur if there is/are suspect premises (see paragraphs 76-101) within the zone at which veterinary inquiries are ongoing or for which laboratory 54 results are pending. If no laboratory results are pending and no premises are suspected of housing poultry infected with the virus, the WBCA may become part of the WBMA before 21 days. 224 The WBMA will be in place for at least 30 days following the date of collection of the samples from the infected wild bird. Its duration will take account of surveillance in the area showing that there is no disease present in poultry or other captive birds. Measures within zones 225 The table below details the key standard measures that will apply in the relevant disease control area. In addition, the following key principles apply: The Declaration will detail the exact requirements within the area(s). In relation to measures under which movements are subject to licence, see paragraphs 228-241. Legislation allows for the measures within the control areas to be based on an assessment of the risk of disease spreading to poultry or other captive birds. This means that there is scope for each outbreak to be assessed throughout its duration and treated accordingly on a case- by-case basis. As such: o Additional measures can be applied if considered necessary. These could, for example, relate to housing, feeding, watering and biosecurity requirements aimed at reducing the risk of transmission between wild birds and poultry or other captive birds. o After 21 days following the declaration of the disease control areas, certain measures in the WBCA and WBMA may be relaxed subject to a favourable VRA and to there being no outbreak of HPAI H5N1 confirmed or suspected in poultry or captive birds in the WBCA or W BMA (see paragraph 223). 55 HPAI H5N1 in wild birds restrictions Restrictions in Zone(s) WBCA WBMA Default radius (km) 10 Minimum length of time in place since the collection of samples from the infected wild bird (days) 2111 30 Movement restrictions - poultry or other captive birds Y Y Movement restrictions - hatching eggs Y N Movement restrictions - bird by products Y N Restrictions/Requirements - controlled meat Y N Restrictions - poultry /other captive bird manure Y N Biosecurity Y Y Ban on bird gatherings Y Y Ban on the release of game birds Y Y Ban on hunting/taking of wild birds Y Y Key: Movement restrictions : movements of the things listed will be subject to restrictions. Restrictions/Requirements - controlled meat12: movements will be subject to restrictions and requirements in place in relation to the marking and separation of such meat from other meat. Restrictions - poultry /other captive bird: may only be removed from premises or spread under certain circumstances. Requirements - fresh meat and meat products : requirements relating to marking, sourcing, cutting, transportation and storage will be in place. Biosecurity : appropriate measures must be put in place for people entering or leaving premises where poultry or other captive birds are kept (other than slaughterhouses). Ban on bird gatherings : bird gatherings will not be permitted within the zone. Ban on the release of game birds : the release of game birds will not be permitted within the zone. 11 See paragraphs 223- 224 for circumstances where this may become part of the WBMA before this date. 12 Controlled meat means any fresh meat, minced meat, meat preparation, mechanically separated meat or meat product which has not undergone heat treatment at a minimum temperature of 70\u00b0C (which must be reached throughout the meat) derived from poultry (including game birds and pet hens and other poultry species) or wild game birds originating from within a wild bird control area (for definitions of fresh meat, minced meat, meat preparation, mechanically separated meat or meat product, see legislation listed i n Annex 2 - European and GB legislation for the control of NAD . 56 Ban on hunting/taking of wild birds : the hunting of wild birds or the taking of them from the wild will be banned unless licensed13. 13 Licensed here refers to a licence issued under the Avian Influenza (H5N1 in Wild Birds) England Order 2006 in England, the Avian Influenza (H5N1 in Wild Birds) (Wales) Order 2006 in Wales or the Avian Influenza (H5N1 in Wild Birds) Scotland Order 2006 in Scotland. 57 Controls outside disease control areas General 226 Legislation does not require any specific controls outside of the declared zones. However, as detailed in paragraphs 72-75, a prevention zone may be declared if it is determined that there is a heightened risk of AI infection or spread in GB from wild birds to poultry and other captive birds. Bird gatherings 227 So long as evidence suggests that HPAI H5N1 infection remains confined to wild birds and does not spread to poultry (including game birds and poultry kept as pets) or other captive birds, it can be expected that bird gatherings will be permitted to continue, subject to compliance with the relevant general licence (see paragraph 229). 58 Exiting from movement restrictions Disease control zones National movement ban 228 Imposition of a national ban on movements including poultry (including game birds and poultry kept as pets), other captive birds, eggs and poult ry meat/carcases is not proposed for outbreaks of NAD. The nature of the diseases and experience gained in their control across the EU suggests that such a ban would add little benefit in terms of disease control. Licensing 229 The legal framework underpinning the measures described in paragraphs 154- 184 and paragraphs 214-228 in disease control zones allows for the licensing of certain movements or activities in certain circumstances. Where there is licence provision and, based on expert opinion, it is concluded that allowing a movement or activity would not risk spreading disease, a licence may be issued. Licenses will have conditions which are considered necessary to reduce the risk of possible disease spread. Licenses may be in the form of a: Specific licence - applied for at the APHA office, allowing a one- off movement/activity subject to conditions. Multiple licence - applied for at the APHA office, allowing a number of movements/activities to take place over a certain period, subject to conditions, without having to apply for separate licences for each movement/activity. General licence - placed on the GOV.UK website, allowing a movement/activity to take place without applying for a licence. So long as the conditions of the licence can be met, the movement/activity can be undertaken. 230 As part of good contingency planning, government maintains a library of template licenses for NAD that can be used in an outbreak. Licen sing strategy 231 Experience of controlling outbreaks of NAD in both GB and across the EU has, to date, largely involved the early detection of disease leading to a single/low number of IPs. Control measures required by European legislation detailed in this control strategy have been successful in stamping out disease. 232 During previous outbreaks in GB, movement controls within disease control zones have been able to be gradually eased, subject to an assessment of risk of the spread of disease. As such, the princ iples detailed below are based on this experience: as epidemiological circumstances may vary in future outbreaks, decisions on movements and licences are also subject to variation. 59 233 It is important to note that the impact of movement restrictions will depend on the nature of the activities related to the poultry /other captive bird sector within the declared disease control zones including: The number, size and type of premises containing poultry or other captive birds within the zones. The types of related premises within the zones (e.g. location of slaughterhouses, hatcheries) and whether these are designated or not (i.e. premises which meet high biosecurity standards and are registered as such with government /APHA). The type of activities normally carried out within the zone (e.g. bird gatherings, shooting/hunting of wild birds). 234 Upon confirmation of NAD, it is vital that such information is established as soon as possible. However, the role of key stakeholders is crucial in drawing to government 's attention the potential \"pinch- points\" caused by restrictions. As such, mitigating action can be initiated at an early stage of the outbreak in an attempt to minimise such impacts. Government sources, such as the GBPR, are also used to establish the likely impact of movement restrictions within the zone. Low risk movements 235 Under normal circumstances, it can be expected that certain low risk movements may be licensed within the first few days after confirmation of disease. The following movements fall into such a category, subject to the disease concerned and certain conditions being met (including those of the respective licenses ): Movement of table eggs to a designated 14 packing centre. Movement of table eggs or hatching eggs to an egg processing plant or for disposal. Movement of hatching eggs to a designated hatchery. Movement of specific pathogen free eggs to a designated laboratory, institute or vaccine manufacturer for scientific, diagnostic or pharmaceutical uses. Movement of day -old chicks from designated hatch eries (other than into a PZ). Movement of poultry for slaughter in a designated slaughterhouse. Carcases for diagnosis (other than for NAD). Carcases for disposal (subject to animal by-products regulations and biosecurity instructions). 14 See Glossary and paragraphs 237- 240 for definition of designated . 60 Movement of table eggs within the PZ direct to retail premises, or at/from such premises15. 236 Some of these movements may be licensed from the outset of an outbreak. Designation 237 In certain circumstances during an outbreak it is a legal requirement that a premises/plant is officially designated, for example when a farm located within a Protection Zone, wishes to receive eggs from another farm that is not located within the same zone. A designated premises/plant is one that has been specifically approved to operate either in a particular disease control zone, or with birds (or meat or eggs from such birds) that originated from certain disease control zones. To gain official designation for hatcheries or egg packing stations, producers will need to contact the APHA office in Worcester. This can be done by: Writing to: Customer Service Centre One Health, Level 1, County Hall, Spetchley Road, Worcester WR5 2NP; Telephone: : 020 822 56122; Email: CSCOneHealthPHS@apha.go v.uk For Scottish keepers please see the Scottish Government website 238 The designation process will require an application, official inspection and a formal official app roval. To become designated there are requirements for enhanced biosecurity and in some cases additional requirements for special marking of products, separation of restricted products, and record keeping/traceability. 239 Premises in disease control zones may only send poultry to slaughter where the movement is licensed and the receiving slaughterhouse is designated. There are similar licensing requirements for the movement of table eggs to a designated egg packing centre (if not being sent for disposal or to an egg processing plant) and hatching eggs to a designated hatchery. Premises in disease control zones may only receive day -old chicks where the movement is licensed and they originate from a designated hatchery. A slaughterhouse, egg packing centre or hat chery located within a disease control zone must be designated if it is to receive poultry or eggs from any premises (whether originating from premises within or outside disease control zones), movements of which must be licensed. 240 Premises wishing to operate during an outbreak may apply for designation during an outbreak. They may also apply in advance of an outbreak for provisional approval allowing any deficiencies to be corrected in advance by contacting 15 Applicable to Newcastle disease only due to differing legislation. 61 the APHA . However, provisionally approved premises/plants will need to apply for their designation to be activated for each specific outbreak , the designation will normally lapse at the end of each outbreak . Those provisionally designated in advance should find formal approval of designation is quicker compared to making a new application at the time of an outbreak. Other movements 241 Other movements, such as live poultry /other captive birds (to live rather than for slaughter) and poultry litter/manure/slurry within or out of zones carry a greater risk of further spreading NAD virus. Consequently, such movements are not likely to be considered by experts for licensing until the epidemiological situation has become clearer, the outbreak had been thus far contained and evidence suggests that there had been no further onward spread of the virus. Government will work with key stakeholders to understand where there are potential issues developing and, where a VRA indicates that disease control can be maintained, will seek to release key licences as soon as possible. Additional conditions such as veterinary inspections and sampling/testing poultry may be required as part of these licence conditions which will need to be arranged by the licence applicant. Exports Exports to other European Union countries 242 Once disease control zones are lifted, and provided that any additional safeguard measures imposed on the UK during an outbreak have also been lifted, the export of poultry and poultry products to other MSs from the previously restricted areas can resume as normal. Exports to non-European Union countries 243 Export health certificates agreed with non- EU countries vary and reflect the destination country's import conditions. Some Third Countries will suspend UK imports even though export health certificates can be signed. During outbreaks of NAD, government will liaise with exporters, British Embassies overseas and non- EU countries' veterinary authorities to keep export markets open and facilitate exports. Priority will be given to those markets most important to exporters. Customer Information Notes are issued on the GOV.UK website to inform exporters about trade restrictions. Defra's role in such discussions with Third Countries may continue for a significant period of time following an outbreak of NAD and subsequent re- establishment of disease freedom . Recovering International Disease Free Status 244 The OIE sets out requirements which determine whether a country is regarded as disease free. For both AI and ND, the earliest date to regain disease free status following an outbreak is 3 months after a stamping out policy has been completed, which includes the disinfection of all IP s (i.e. either the premises has 62 either been taken out of production for 12 months or C&D to OIE standards or final C&D as described in paragraphs 134-137 has been completed) and surveillance as required under EU and international legislation. Alternatively, disease free status can be obtained when it has been shown, through surveillance, that infection with either ND or AI viruses in poultry has not been present for the past 12 months. 63 Annex 1 - Glossary of Terms APHA Animal and Plant Health Agency.
