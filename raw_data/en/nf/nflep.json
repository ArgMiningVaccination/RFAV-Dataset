As economic and social reforms picked up pace in the last two decades, the country witnessed rapid development. There has been a marked shift in the country's disease pattern in the last three decades. The morbidity and mortality due to noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and injuries have increased whereas morbidity and mortality due to communicable, maternal, and neonatal infections has declined. The five leading chronic diseases in India are mental health disorders, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cancer. India contributes to more than two- thirds of the total deaths due to NCDs in the World Health Organization (WHO) South-East Asia Region (SEAR). The prevalence of NCDs is likely to increase in the coming years due to higher life expectancy as well as factors such as urbanization and industrialization. The government of India launched the National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) and the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) in 1982 and 2010, respectively. These programs are implemented through a multitier system covering primary, secondary, and tertiary care. As a public and private health system, the private sector also plays a key role in delivering NCD care. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted weaknesses in the health system, including how limited investments in NCDs had a direct impact on both mortality and morbidity rates. With support from Access Accelerated, PATH undertook an NCD landscaping study to identify the key stakeholders as well as barriers and facilitators in the provision of NCD care. PATH developed priority areas of investment based on expert interviews, local prevalence data, and a review of policies and related literature exposing barriers and facilitators to access to quality NCD care. The landscaping study was conducted from September to December 2020. The report uses the WHO health systems building blocks to understand the Indian NCD landscape. The barriers and recommendations are documented through the lens of these blocks: service delivery, health workforce, information systems, access to medicines, health financing, and leadership and governance, with an additional emphasis on how COVID-19 impacted access to care and service delivery through the attribute of resilience. This report complements India's renewed commitment to achieving universal health coverage (UHC). In 2018, India launched Ayushman Bharat\u2014one of the most ambitious health missions ever\u2014to achieve UHC. It encompasses two complementary schemes, Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs) and the National Health Protection Scheme (NHPS). HWCs are envisioned as a foundation of the health system to provide comprehensive primary care and free essential medicines and diagnostic services, whereas the NHPS is envisaged to provide financial risk protection to poor and vulnerable families arising out of secondary and tertiary care hospitalization in the amount of five lakh rupees (approximately US$6,800) per family per year. The assessment was completed using a secondary review of national survey data, a literature review, and qualitative insights through in-depth interviews with key stakeholders. A total of 41 interviews were conducted at a national level and across four states (Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, and Kerala). National policies, program documents, treatment guidelines, and protocols were reviewed to inform the report development and discussions.India contributes to more than two- thirds of the total deaths due to NCDs in the World Health Organization (WHO) South- East Asia Region (SEAR)7 India Noncommunicable Disease LandscapingKey findings The landscape revealed important barriers across all six WHO building blocks. India has a mixed health system where both the government and private sector offer health services. The government offers preventive, promotive, and curative care, whereas the private sector mostly caters to curative and clinical care only. This report focuses on challenges primarily from the public-sector provisioning. Listed below are the key barriers or challenges of the government-funded, supported, and implemented work in NCD. Service delivery 1. Lack of prioritization of NCDs in service delivery impact the quality of NCD care. 2. Operational delays in activating Health and Wellness Centre ( HWC) impact NCD care at the community level. 3. Lack of unified systems across public and private sectors create challenges in patient and data capture resulting in low treatment adherence. 4. Poor awareness about NCDs among the general population leads to delayed diagnosis and poor treatment adherence. 5. Poorly defined referral systems from primary levels to specialized care impact treatment linkages. 6. Stigma around mental health is a barrier to seeking care. Health workforce 1. Shortage of human resources to provide NCD screening and referral services at primary care level impacts quality of care. 2. Inadequate training and mentoring support for individuals providing NCD care, including frontline workers, community health workers (CHWs), and informal providers impacts quality of care. Health information systems 1. Lack of consistent and high-quality data on the NCD disease burden impacts planning and resource allocation. 2. Absence of rigorous evaluations on NCD interventions in both public and private sector impacts program improvements. 3. Absence of a unified and countrywide data system to review routine NCD program data impacts planning and resource allocation. Access to medicines 1. Medication shortages and short prescription cycles create barriers in treatment adherence. 2. The lack of standardized treatment protocols and prescribing habits lead to challenges in access and consistent use.8 India Noncommunicable Disease LandscapingHealth financing 1. Financing for NCDs in India remains low compared to maternal and child health and infectious diseases. Private sources currently provide inadequate and short-term funding. 2. The current national insurance scheme, Ayushman Bharat, covers most of the key NCD- related surgical procedures but does not cover most outpatient or primary care services. Leadership and governance 1. Lack of intersectoral, interdepartmental collaboration makes it difficult to tackle the growing burden of NCDs in a holistic fashion. 2. Commercial interests influence policy development, leading to a lack of regulation and guidelines around risk factors for NCDs (other than tobacco). 3. No defined platform exists for the private sector to engage with state-level governments. Health system resilience during COVID-19 The COVID-19 epidemic has exposed the fault lines of an under-resourced health system, especially in the provision of NCD care. 1. During the COVID-19 lockdown, NCD patients faced interruptions in medication procurement, access to health facilities, and maintenance of regular medical checkups due to a shortage of essential medicines, higher drug prices, and unavailability of government transportation. 2. Both the public and private sectors expanded telemedicine platforms for consultations, but these were inaccessible to patients without access to smartphones or internet. Recommendations The India NCD landscape assessment revealed important barriers in the country's NCD response. In response to these barriers, the following recommendations were put forward to improve access to essential NCD care in the country. Service delivery 1. Strengthen the NCD component of UHC through the HWCs by integrating digital health systems, electronic health records, and speedy implementation of the National Health ID. 2. Design holistic interventions that involve upgrading infrastructure, deploying more efficient supply chain systems for drugs and diagnostics, designing and building an adequate referral mechanism to the appropriate level of care depending on the type of NCD, etc. 3. Pilot and scale public-private partnership models in urban areas by involving private primary care providers with a continuum-of-care approach with call centers and e-vendors for dispensing medicines. 4. Incorporate NCD awareness and screening services in school health programs and Adolescent Friendly Health Clinics under the National Health Mission. 9 India Noncommunicable Disease LandscapingHealth workforce 1. Support public health systems to devise strategies to reduce the work burden on clinicians by delegating screening, diagnosing, and managing patient tasks. 2. Develop a comprehensive and holistic training system with offline and digital components and adequate mentoring and guidance support. 3. Train CHWs and informal providers to diagnose and refer care for NCDs, including mental health. Health information systems 1. Assist frontline workers in the adoption and uptake of digital technologies to address the paucity and lack of quality of NCD service delivery data. 2. Collaborate with government agencies to evaluate NCD interventions and use the findings for program improvement and advocacy. 3. Utilize existing platforms to incorporate artificial intelligence and other technologies to facilitate improved health data collection, storage, and utilization with limited monetary investments. 4. Build predictive models for NCD incidence, prevalence, and risk assessment using data analytics. 5. Implement systems such as the NCD Navigator (mapping of country NCD initiatives implemented in Kenya and Ghana) to support planning, resource allocation, and alignment with national strategy. Access to medicines 1. Strengthen the supply chain in the public sector to address the challenges arising as a result of a shortage of medicines. 2. Advocate and promote the uptake of standardized and evidence-based care for NCDs to bring in uniformity and consistency in the treatment modalities and medications being prescribed by different service providers. 3. Develop community-based models for chronic care, treatment adherence support, and rehabilitation. 10 India Noncommunicable Disease LandscapingHealth financing 1. Advocate with public sector for additional allocations and transparency in expenditure data. 2. Work with existing private donors to develop holistic, inclusive, and comprehensive funding strategies that are patient-centered (rather than disease-centered). 3. Build mechanisms for institutionalizing health stack funding, where various social security schemes (central and state) bundled together could provide a lump sum amount for NCDs and specifically cancer care. 4. Advocate for the expansion of the national insurance scheme, Ayushman Bharat, to cover outpatient and primary care services. Leadership and governance 1. Institutionalise health system resilience activities during and post COVID-19 pandemic 2. Support government development of a strong policy framework that ensures all NCD interventions provide holistic patient care. 3. Strengthen multi-sector collaboration of government, industry, and communities through the various committees for NCD prevention and control to improve service delivery, financing, and infrastructure. 4. Advocate for the production and sale of healthy food packages and introduction of sugar and salt tax for unhealthy food items. 5. Advocate to increase the resource allocation for building NCD infrastructure, equipment (cancer treatment centers, etc.), and other interventions in states prioritized by disease burden. Health system resilience during and after COVID-19 1. Integrate COVID-19 and NCD screening at primary and secondary levels of care and ensure patients are referred and linked to appropriate facilities for specialized care. 2. Develop strategies for long-term follow-up of recovered COVID-19 patients with existing comorbidities by building up risk profiles for NCD patients. 3. Increase outreach and awareness programs on COVID-19 complications for NCD patients. 4. Implement community-based distribution of NCD medicines to address interruptions in access to medicines.11 India Noncommunicable Disease LandscapingRecommendation for investments PATH developed the following priority areas of investment based on expert interviews, local prevalence data, and a review of policies and related literature exposing barriers and facilitators to access to quality NCD care. 1. Strengthen the rollout of NCD packages under the Comprehensive Primary Health Care program in rural areas NCD care at the primary level is the need of the hour, especially in many rural areas where the public health care system is the sole source of medical care. COVID-19 has underscored the importance of ensuring people with existing comorbidities receive timely and consistent care to prevent complications. To implement this recommendation: Accelerate the rollout of NCD preventive, promotive, and treatment services for hypertension and diabetes and screening and referral services for cancer and mental health. This can be operationalized using the following strategies: -Adopt and implement innovative digital training modules for frontline workers. -Design referral services from HWCs to appropriate secondary and tertiary care to reduce delay in diagnosis and treatment. -Assist the rollout of the National Health ID and electronic health records systems. -Deploy easy-to-use and cost-effective point-of-care diagnostics. 2. Pilot NCD packages with private-sector primary care providers in urban areas Primary care in the urban areas (especially the low-income localities) are dominated by general practitioners and non-allopathic physicians. They command a large loyal patient base for primary care issues due to their proximity and low consultation costs.12 India Noncommunicable Disease LandscapingTo implement this recommendation: Design financial packages for outpatient care (diagnostics and drugs) of NCD conditions that can be managed at primary care levels. These financial packages could be in the form of prepaid insurance plans/risk pooling to help lessen out-of-pocket expenditure in the long run. Build linkages to government systems for data sharing between the private and public sectors. Develop systems for referral and long-term follow-up using digital technologies. Train CHWs and family members to support long-term follow-up and support treatment adherence. 3. Deploy comprehensive mental health services for targeted groups using digital health tools It is estimated that nearly 7.5 percent of the population suffers from some mental disorder. COVID-19 has exacerbated and impacted mental health across the world. There is a huge shortage of psychiatrists and psychologists in the country as compared to the number of people suffering from mental health issues. To implement this recommendation: Pilot hybrid models of in-person and digital mental health care to address the growing mental health burden in the country. Build the capacity of primary care physicians and community health volunteers to diagnose, treat, and refer patients for common mental health conditions. Design health promotion campaigns to fight the stigma against mental health. 4. Build a comprehensive intervention for cervical cancer elimination and breast cancer care through public and private sectors India contributes about 122,844 cervical cancer and 144,937 breast cancer cases every year and accounts for nearly one-third of the global cervical cancer deaths, with women facing a 1.6 percent cumulative risk of developing cervical cancer and 1.0 percent cumulative death risk from cervical cancer. Similarly, the cumulative risk of developing breast cancer is 2.7 percent, and the cumulative death risk is 1.5 percent. To implement this recommendation: Collaborate with the national and state governments and the private sector to build out a comprehensive intervention to improve awareness and strengthen screening services and treatment of precancerous lesions. 5. Build a comprehensive intervention to tackle the obesity epidemic The latest National Family Health Survey indicates that 20 of 22 major states in India are seeing an increasing prevalence of obesity in adults and children. Obesity is associated with an elevated risk of several major NCDs, including type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, asthma, and several cancers. To implement this recommendation: Advocate with the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India to increase the visibility of obesity and related dangers. Design school-based programs for children, young adults, and caregivers to integrate good dietary practices and exercise in their daily routines. Pilot these models among schools in low-income areas where the need is most pressing. As India renews its commitment to UHC and is receptive to aligned interventions and investments in NCDs, this report can provide guidance on where to prioritize investment and enhance stakeholder collaboration. 13 India Noncommunicable Disease LandscapingIntroduction The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are responsible for 41 million deaths each year, equivalent to 71 percent of all deaths globally,1 and that they now exceed all deaths due to communicable diseases.2 India is an emerging economy with a population of more than 1.3 billion individuals. As economic and social reforms picked up pace in the last two decades, India has witnessed economic development and social development. This has been coupled with a major demographic and epidemiological transition. There has been a marked shift in the country's disease pattern in the last three decades. The morbidity and mortality due to NCDs and injuries have increased whereas morbidity and mortality due to communicable, maternal, and neonatal infections has declined. India contributes to more than two-thirds of the total deaths due to NCDs in the South-East Asia Region (SEAR) of WHO. The five leading chronic diseases in India are mental health disorders, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), diabetes mellitus, chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) (especially chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]), and cancer. The upsurge in health care utilization due to increases in the prevalence of chronic diseases and demands among patients for services; provision and awareness among providers; access to treatments; and sharp rise in incomes is expected to continue.3 India runs the risk of losing about $4.6 trillion in lost output due to savings lost and reallocated for treatment and due to loss of productivity and premature mortality.4 Other studies that have attempted to quantify NCDs' burden to the Indian economy have stated the cost of NCDs to be about 5 to 10 percent of gross domestic product.5 The health insurance coverage of India is also extremely low, raising the out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditure burden on the country. Urban residents have more access to public and private institutions compared to rural residents, who depend on public and informal providers. The prevalence of NCDs is disproportionately on the rise among the poor, making them particularly vulnerable to catastrophic health expenditure in addition to lifelong morbidity and increased mortality. The share of OOP health expenditure due to NCDs rose over time, from 32 percent in 1995-1996 to 69 percent in 2004-2005 to 64 percent in 2013-2014.6 The proportion of households with OOP payments equaling or surpassing 10 percent of their consumption expenditure has increased more than two times during the same time period. The share of expenses dedicated to NCDs differed, with wealthier households allocating a larger portion of their spending to NCD care than poorer households. This is probably because of the wealthier households seeking more health care and preventive care. The government of India launched the National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) and the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) in 1982 and 2010, respectively. The mental health program is predominantly medical oriented with an increasing awareness on community participation. The NPCDCS has a focus on awareness generation for behavior and lifestyle changes, screening, and early diagnosis of persons with a high level of risk factors and their referral to appropriate treatment facilities.01 India runs the risk of losing about $4.6 trillion in lost output due to savings lost and reallocated for treatment and due to loss of productivity and premature mortality14 India Noncommunicable Disease Landscaping1.1 NCD epidemiology in India NCDs are a significant burden in India, as evidenced by WHO Country Profile data and other research reports. A summary national prevalence rates of selected NCDs is presented in Table 1. Table 1. Prevalence rates of noncommunicable diseases.* Disease Prevalence/ IncidenceTrend compared to 1990% contribution of total DAL Ys in India (2016-17)% contribution of total deaths in India (2016-17) Mental Disorders million (P) 4.70% disease; CVDs, cardiovascular diseases. * Information gathered from meta-analysis of data from various sources.-11 For cancer incidence, rates are mentioned instead of prevalence. In India, per 100,000 population, there are 0.3 psychiatrists, 0.12 nurses, 0.07 psychologists, and 0.07 social workers, while the desirable number is anything above three psychiatrists and psychologists per 100,000 population.Mental illness In 2017, there were 197.3 million people with mental disorders in India, comprising 14.3 percent of the total population of the country.7 One among every seven people in India had a mental disorder, ranging from mild to severe. Among the mental disorders that manifest predominantly during adulthood, the highest disease burden in India was caused by depressive and anxiety disorders, followed by schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Sex differentials are observed in the distribution of mental disorders in India. There is a higher prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders in females than in males. This could be related to gender discrimination, violence, sexual abuse, antenatal and postnatal stress, and adverse sociocultural norms. There is a positive and modest relationship between depressive disorders and suicide death rates at the state level, with suicide death rates also being higher in the southern states than in the northern ones. The country is grappling with a shortage of mental health care workforce. In India, per 100,000 population, there are 0.3 psychiatrists, 0.12 nurses, 0.07 psychologists, and 0.07 social workers, while the desirable number is anything above three psychiatrists and psychologists per 100,000 population.15 India Noncommunicable Disease LandscapingTable 2.

The leading types of cancer were stomach cancer (9.0 percent), breast cancer (8.2 percent), lung cancer (7.5 percent), lip and oral cavity cancer (7.2 percent), pharynx cancer other than nasopharynx (6.8 percent), colon and rectum cancer (5.8 percent), leukemia (5.2 percent), and cervical cancer (5.2 percent). Among females, the most prevalent cancers were breast, cervical, and stomach cancer, and among males, lung cancer, followed by lip and oral cavity cancer, other pharynx cancer, and stomach cancer.8,12 There was significant geographical variation in the incidence of cancers in India. Cancer incidence and deaths due to cancer in the four states and age standardized incidence rate of oral, breast, and cervical cancers per 100,000 are depicted in Figure 1 and Figure 2. Kerala is leading among the selected states with respect to both incidence and deaths due to cancer. Deaths due to cervical cancer and breast cancer were increasing in Kerala and were higher when compared to Odisha, Maharashtra, and Uttar Pradesh. Cancers of oral cavity and lip was seen to have increased in Kerala as compared to Maharashtra, Odisha, and Uttar Pradesh. 16 India Noncommunicable Disease LandscapingFigure 1. Overall incidence of cancer diseases and death per 100,000 (2016). Figure 2. Age standardized incidence rate of oral, breast, and cervical cancers per 100,000. Cardiovascular diseases In 2016, the estimated prevalence of CVDs in India was estimated to be 54.5 million. One in four deaths in India are because of CVDs. Ischemic heart disease and stroke are responsible for >80 percent of this burden.9 The prevalence of CVDs in 2016 was highest in Kerala, Punjab, and Tamil Nadu. Among the risk factors that contributed to disability-adjusted life years due to CVDs in India, the leading ones were dietary risks (56.4 percent), high systolic blood pressure (54.6 percent), air pollution (31.1 percent), high total cholesterol (29.4 percent), tobacco use (18.9 percent), high fasting plasma glucose (16.7 percent), high body mass index (14.7 percent), and tobacco due to smoking (83.4 percent).

Diabetes There are an estimated 72.96 million cases of diabetes in the adult population of India. The prevalence in urban areas ranges between 10.9-14.2 percent; prevalence in rural India was 3.0-7.8 percent. The prevalence of diabetes is 11.8 percent in people aged above 50, and the highest prevalence was observed in the 70-79 years age group at 13.2 percent.13 Prevalence of diabetes according to NFHS-4 conducted in the year 2015-2016 among people between 15 and 49 years is given in Table 4 and sex-wise prevalence in Figure 3.

Sex-wise prevalence (%) of diabetes in India and four states. Chronic respiratory diseases In 2016, the prevalence of COPD in India was 4.2 percent and the prevalence of asthma 2.9 percent. India has a prevalence of COPD that is higher than the global average. The overall increases in prevalence are mainly due to ageing of the population in India.10 Findings from studies in India have identified associations between CRDs and non-smoking-related factors, such as outdoor air pollution from particulate matter, indoor air pollution from biomass fuels, occupational exposure to crop dust, dust from mines, chemicals, poor socioeconomic status, poor nutrition, overcrowding, and residence in urban slums.9 MenIndi a25 20 15 10 5 all CRDs, COPD had the highest death rate (per 100,000).

The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) is instrumental and responsible for policy direction of various programs on a national scale in the areas of health and family welfare in preventing and controlling the spread of disease outbreaks and epidemics through technical assistance. The states are responsible for the implementation, and budget allocations of various health programs and districts are the units of implementation. The public health system administers its care through a structured machinery of the National Health Mission both in rural and urban areas. At the district level, the Indian health care system is divided into primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. Figure 6. Structure of National Health Mission.

NCD cells have been established at national, state, and district levels for monitoring and evaluation of the program. They have been involved in development, monitoring, and coordination of programs at respective levels. A comprehensive list of NCD programs are attached in Appendix 1. In 1982, the government of India launched the National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) and in 1996, the District Mental Health Programme. The latter envisages provision of basic mental health care services at the community level with the following objectives: To provide sustainable basic mental health services to the community and to integrate these services with other health services. To deliver early detection and treatment of patients within the community itself. To reduce the stigma of mental illness through public awareness. To treat and rehabilitate mental health patients within the community. In 2018, the Ayushman Bharat program (Healthy India) was launched to move from a sectoral and segmented approach of health service delivery to a comprehensive need-based health care service at all tiers of care. The program has two components: Health and Wellness Centres at the community level, providing comprehensive primary health care including free essential drugs and diagnostics. Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) aiming at universal health coverage, providing health protection cover to poor and vulnerable people against financial risk arising out of catastrophic health episodes. 21 India Noncommunicable Disease LandscapingFigure 7.

Investor/donor (bilateral/multilateral/foundation/CSR ) Investments in NCD are viewed as long term, without immediate or tangible return on investments and limited by inadequate understanding of impact measurement, hence the preference for investments ranging for two to three years in communicable disease and reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health (RMNCH+A). Investment patterns show that most donors prefer to invest in one disease or a few risk factors and not across the NCD spectrum. Most investments are geared toward hypertension, diabetes, and cancer. Among risk factors, tobacco commands maximum interest and funding. COVID-19 has been instrumental in highlighting the necessity of investment in mental health and well-being. Bilaterals, multilaterals, and foundations prefer to invest in system-strengthening activities nonspecific to NCDs, while corporate social responsibility program (CSRs) prefer to invest in activities such as awareness building, screening camps, and referral services. CSRs prefer to invest in projects in states and districts where they have extensive market presence or have interests to expand their presence. On the other hand, traditional donors have preferred states that rank low in the Human Development Index. The WHO India Country Office plays a technical and policy advisory role, monitoring progress toward larger international targets under the Sustainable Development Goals and convening multistakeholder and inter-ministerial meetings. The World Bank India Country Office provides financial investment and technical advisory to the PMJAY program\u2014India's largest health insurance program for secondary and tertiary care for those below the poverty line. NGOs and CSOs This category comprises nongovernmental organization (NGO) international and national entities as well as civil society organizations (CSOs) that implement projects, pilot process innovations, and assist the government while they scale successful proof-of-concept initiatives. Most project designs had a public-private partnership (PPP) component. Implementers are constrained by the nature of funding that dictates how funding should be allocated and hence discrete activities are implemented instead of a holistic continuum-of-care approach. Despite best efforts, this stakeholder group has not been able to have significant impact on either mobilization of resources or raising visibility of the need for additional investment for NCDs. Concerted efforts for translation of intersectoral policies into solutions were absent. Academic institutions Academic institutions focus on policy, operations, systems research evaluations, capacity-building, and design and analysis of large-scale surveys and compete with NGOs for grants in specific areas.23 India Noncommunicable Disease Landscaping1.4 Improving NCD programming through health systems strengthening The government of India, in its policy articulation and investments, is showing an increasing interest in NCDs and seems to be recognizing the importance of investing in NCD care. After the endorsement of the World Health Assembly resolution and Global Action Plan for Prevention and Control of NCDs, India became the first country globally to define its National NCD Monitoring Framework with country-specific targets and indicators and committed to ten targets and 21 indicators to be achieved by 2025. The COVID-19 epidemic has underscored the importance of why NCDs cannot be neglected any further. Though there are well-established NCD programs at the national and state levels, service delivery is impacted by inadequate financing, infrastructure, and human resources. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has developed extensive policies and guidelines for the NPCDCS, NMHP , and HWCs. India became the first country globally to define its National NCD Monitoring Framework with country-specific targets and indicators and committed to ten targets and 21 indicators to be achieved by 202524 India Noncommunicable Disease Landscaping2.1 Goal and objectives PATH, with funding from Access Accelerated, conducted a landscape analysis of NCDs to map existing and emerging efforts and gaps in policy and practice in India. The goal of this study was to understand India's NCD ecosystem to ensure that future activities and investments are aligned with the national strategy. The objectives of the analysis were as follows:Introduction to NCD landscaping exercise 02 Understand current policies and practices that influence service delivery.Document key stakeholders in the NCD space.Identify the gaps and challenges creating the largest barriers to access high-quality NCD- related prevention and care services. This landscape assessment was analyzed through the lens of the six WHO building blocks, as defined here: Good service deliveries are those that deliver effective, safe, quality personal and nonpersonal health interventions to those who need them, when and where needed, with minimum waste of resources. A well-performing health workforce is one that works in responsive ways and is fair and efficient to achieve the best health outcomes possible, given available resources and circumstances. A well-functioning health information system is one that ensures the production, analysis, dissemination, and use of reliable and timely information on health determinants, health system performance, and health status. A well-functioning health system ensures equitable access to essential medical products, vaccines, and technologies of assured quality, safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness, with scientifically sound and cost-effective use. A good health system financing raises adequate funds for health, in ways that ensure people can use needed services and are protected from financial catastrophe or impoverishment associated with having to pay for them. Leadership and governance involve ensuring the existence of policy frameworks combined with effective oversight, coalition building, regulation, attention to system design, and accountability. 25 India Noncommunicable Disease LandscapingFigure 9.

The secondary research was carried out through systemic reviews of documents/information available on public domain. The information was synthesized and used to develop a comprehensive understanding around the models' reach, coverage, and efficacy of implementation. Stakeholder analysis: An in-depth stakeholder analysis was undertaken to get an understanding of the various actors and coordinating mechanisms within the NCD space. The stakeholder analysis helped to identify the NGOs, donors funding NCD-related interventions, efforts made by multilateral organizations, etc. Key informant interviews: Key informant interviews were conducted with select relevant stakeholders identified in the stakeholder analysis. These included key government officials in charge of the NCD programs in the states, multilateral agencies, donors, NGOs, and other entities such as CSRs. The themes covered during these interviews were details of their models, outcomes achieved, program effectiveness, reach and quality, barriers to access, roles of different players, policy sufficiency to support interventions, etc. A list of stakeholders is attached as Appendix 2.26 India Noncommunicable Disease LandscapingStep 2: Conducting critical analysis using WHO Framework of Analysis A desk review was undertaken to identify a set of frameworks for analysis and their applicability to study objectives for the critical analysis of the data gathered through secondary research and key informant interviews. Step 3: Compilation of findings The secondary data and primary research were collated and compiled to understand and interpret the information. This was then converted into the landscaping report, which includes key insights and recommendations for investments. Data collection tools A list of national policies, treatment guidelines, and protocols were reviewed. Interview guides were developed for discussions with key stakeholders in the government and private sector (list of key respondents in Appendix 2 and interview guides in Appendix 3). Study sites For the purposes of the study, the research team proposed a deep-dive understanding at the national level and in 4 states (out of 30 states/federal entities) where the prevalence of NCDs were among the highest. The criteria for selection of the states were as follows. Step 1: A compilation of prevalence rates for cancer, diabetes, hypertension, and obesity from various national surveys was prepared. States were ranked based on how they fared in relation to the national prevalence average of these conditions. Those that fared poorly in comparison to the national average were longlisted. Step 2: The team layered additional selection criteria like epidemiological transition level, the national health index that ranks the overall status of health, and PATH's existing presence and governmental relationships in a state. Based on this two-step process, a score sheet was prepared to shortlist the states. Step 3: States were divided region-wise, and one state was selected for each zone. North\u2014Uttar Pradesh South\u2014Kerala West\u2014Maharashtra East\u2014Odisha 2.3 Limitations Short study duration: The landscaping exercise relied primarily on desk research and discussions with key stakeholders. Any additional validation at field level and triangulation of data would have required a longer study period into specific areas. COVID-19: Due to the prevailing pandemic and pressing priorities, key persons in the government and other heads of organizations were not always receptive to long interviews. Unavailability of data: While key surveys indicated general prevalence rates of NCDs and their risk factors, there was limited information of how state governments were performing in their NCD portfolios, evaluations of their innovative interventions, and budgetary allocations. In a mixed health system like India , private health care providers and the for-profit ecosystem (for service delivery, technologies, etc.) play a major role. The study chose to focus only on the responses by governments and by the not-for-profit sector.27 India Noncommunicable Disease LandscapingThe following section highlights the challenges or barriers in the ability of health systems to deliver NCD care through the lens of the WHO health systems building blocks. Challenges and recommendations 03 3.1 Service delivery Challenges Lack of prioritization of NCDs in service delivery impacts the quality of NCD care. Despite renewed interest and increasing importance of NCDs, the program is largely geared to providing other services. Health facilities at the primary and secondary levels do not have the sufficient infrastructure, diagnostic, and management capacity to handle the additional NCD portfolio activities. NCDs are also divided into multiple vertical programs for hypertension, tobacco control, diabetes, cancer, etc., with separate reporting components, hence making a comprehensive overhaul more complex. Operational delays in activating Health and Wellness Centres impact NCD care at the community level. At the program launch in 2018, it was envisioned that India would have 150,000 HWCs. Only 56,513 (37 percent), however, are operationalized across the country. The unavailability of universal NCD care at the community level has hampered availability and access of services. Hence, crucial NCD screening services are not as prevalent as initially conceptualized. Lack of unified systems across public and private sectors create challenges in patient data capture, resulting in low treatment adherence. NCD care is ongoing and involves lifestyle changes. Medication and long-term medical care mean that diagnosed patients need to be consistent with their treatment demands. Apart from complexities around individual and community behavioral and adoption barriers, NCD care also poses a strain on the existing health system. Long-term follow-up on compliance to medication and tracking and updating individual records is an additional responsibility for the system already struggling with other priorities. Patient movement between public and private sectors as per choice and convenience compounds the above issue further. A near absence of systems to capture care, especially outpatient/primary care, means a patient could be lost to follow-up. In the worst-case scenario, NCD patients are not receiving care in any sector. Poorly defined referral system from primary levels for specialized care impact treatment linkages. Poorly defined referral networks within the government tiered facilities means that both frontline workers and patients themselves have limited clarity where to seek care when they present with serious NCDs or complications. More often than not, patients directly reach tertiary care facilities for conditions that could be managed at lower levels or end up reaching the tertiary care very late due to incomplete understanding of how and where to seek care. In the public-funded insurance program, cardiovascular surgeries and oncology packages were the top services availed and are among the most expensive as well. Patients usually present at late stages due to inadequate screening and inefficient referral services, thus necessitating more expensive surgeries and procedures. Poor awareness about NCDs among the general population leads to delayed diagnosis and poor treatment adherence. There is fear associated with NCDs because of myths, misconceptions, and lack of knowledge on what needs to be done. In donor-supported 28 India Noncommunicable Disease Landscapingprograms implemented by NGOs, the focus seemed more on awareness generation with specific target groups like school children, factory workers, or white-collar employees; conducting screening camps for diabetes and hypertension through mobile medical units; and referral services to the nearest public health center. No funder or organization worked across all the risk factors and all the NCDs and hence a comprehensive approach was missing. Stigma around mental health is a barrier to seeking care. The stigma around mental health is still very prevalent in the country and is a barrier to seeking timely care. Furthermore, mental health care is dominated by medical treatment with limited focus on psychological and social rehabilitation. Recommendations Strengthen the NCD component of universal health coverage through the Health and Wellness Centres by integrating digital health systems, electronic health records, and speedy implementation of the National Health ID. Design holistic interventions that involve upgrading infrastructure, deploying more efficient supply chain systems for drugs and diagnostics, designing and building an adequate referral mechanism to the appropriate level of care depending on the type of NCD, etc. Pilot and scale public-private partnership models in urban areas by involving private primary care providers with a continuum-of-care approach with call centers and e-vendors for dispensing medicines. Incorporate NCD awareness and screening services in school health programs and Adolescent Friendly Health Clinics under the National Health Mission. 29 India Noncommunicable Disease Landscaping3.2 Health workforce Challenges Shortage of human resources to provide NCD screening and referral services at primary care level impacts quality of care. Most of the frontline workers, nurses, and doctors at these levels are catering to public health provisioning for other disease verticals, and staff shortages increase the work burden on existing staff. This challenge is ubiquitous in urban and rural areas but more pronounced in the latter. The gaps in capacity- building and limited understanding of NCD risk factors and long-term implications restrict their ability to provide holistic care. Inadequate training and mentoring support for individuals providing NCD care, including frontline workers, CHWs, and informal providers impacts quality of care. Due to the heavy patient load across health facilities, health care workers are simultaneously dealing with preventive, promotive, curative, and clinical work streams with limited bandwidth and hence present with inefficiencies during service delivery. The current training and capacity-building methods are classroom based and in lecture format, with very little scope to gauge actual learning. Post the training sessions, there is no system available for on-the-job guidance and training. There are limited models for digital training of frontline workers. Recommendations Support public health systems to devise strategies to reduce the work burden on clinicians by delegating screening, diagnosing, and managing patient tasks. Develop a comprehensive and holistic training system with offline and digital components and adequate mentoring and guidance support. Train CHWs and informal providers to diagnose and refer care for NCDs including mental health. 3.3 Health information systems Challenges Lack of consistent and high-quality data on the NCD disease burden impacts planning and resource allocation. There is no regular surveillance mechanism in place and there is a lack of quality data on the NCD disease burden, diagnosis, and service delivery. Limited efforts have been made around risk factor/behavior surveillance, other than tobacco and piecemeal efforts toward drug abuse/alcoholism. There is no way to measure the progress that has been made. The major sources for NCD data are from National Family Health Survey, cancer registries, India state-level disease burden reports, etc. Routine program data for data-driven decision-making is not a prevalent practice. Currently, a digital app/portal deployed by the Tata Trusts and Dell Foundation aims to collect data across multiple NCDs and at various points of care. The uptake has been inconsistent and varied across states due to general system-related gaps in data surveillance. Studies that have analyzed the performance of health information systems of the NCD program have cited the nonavailability of data as one of the major challenges of the program. NCDs being a multisectoral disease will require collection of information beyond the health sector, and the existing systems for data collection and analysis are not aligned to other national health programs. Another study done in Odisha revealed lack of monitoring and supervision in the collection of NCD-related morbidity and mortality data. The study also found that surveillance for chronic diseases does 30 India Noncommunicable Disease Landscapingnot seem to be integrated successfully into state and national health information systems. Moreover, the tendency has been to focus on gathering data for the coverage of specific services and surveillance for NCDs often for the purpose of ensuring accountability. Absence of rigorous evaluations on NCD interventions in both public and private sectors impacts program improvements. Research on NCDs is very individually driven and by private-sector institutions. While the state governments pilot and implement many ideas, most initiatives are not subjected to rigorous external evaluations. Hence, it is difficult to measure both short- and long-term impact of these pilots. Given the limitation of short-term projects for chronic care patients, the donor and NGO projects have a tendency to focus on inputs and process indicators as opposed to long-term wellness indicators. Absence of a unified and countrywide data system to review routine NCD program data impacts planning and resource allocation. The current system effective monitoring of NCD programs in India in the public sector is characterized by fragmentation and lack of coordination across various levels. The NPCDCS program has its own health information management system that collects monthly disaggregated data for each level of health facility on each individual disease. These formats are designed to capture data on new patients screened at the facility, the number of patients treated at the facility, and the number of patients referred to higher centers. A district NCD nodal officer is required to collate the data monthly and submit it to the NCD unit at the state. Recommendations Assist frontline workers in the adoption and uptake of digital technologies to address the paucity and lack of quality of NCD service delivery data. Collaborate with government agencies to evaluate NCD interventions and use the findings for program improvement and advocacy. Utilize existing platforms to incorporate artificial intelligence and other technologies to facilitate improved health data collection, storage, and utilization with limited monetary investments. Build predictive models for NCD incidence, prevalence, and risk assessment using data analytics. Implement systems such as the NCD Navigator (mapping of country NCD initiatives implemented in Kenya and Ghana) to support planning, resource allocation, and alignment with the national strategy.The current system effective monitoring of NCD programs in India in the public sector is characterized by fragmentation and lack of coordination across various levels.31 India Noncommunicable Disease Landscaping3.4 Access to essential medicines Challenges Medication shortages and short prescription cycles create barriers in treatment adherence. In the public health system, medicine shortage is a common challenge wherein patients are given medicines for durations of 7 or 15 days. Patients are then asked to return for subsequent refills. As NCDs tend to have long-term drug intake, patients find it cumbersome to come back at such short frequencies for subsequent prescriptions. Patients then prefer to buy drugs from chemists closer to their residence, which increases their out-of-pocket expenditure. The lack of standardized treatment protocols and prescribing habits lead to challenges in access and consistent use. Though NCD medicines are on the national medicines list, the lack of standardized treatment protocols and prescribing habits lead to challenges in access and consistent use. Clinicians do not consistently follow standardized treatment protocols due to the challenges of staying up to date with guidelines and the lack of consistent training. Recommendations Strengthen the supply chain in the public sector to address the challenges arising as a result of shortage of medicines. Advocate and promote the uptake of standardized and evidence-based care for NCDs to bring in uniformity and consistency in the treatment modalities and medications being prescribed by different service providers. Develop community-based models for chronic care, treatment adherence support, and rehabilitation. 32 India Noncommunicable Disease Landscaping3.5 Health system financing Challenges Financing of NCDs in India remains low. Financing for NCDs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) like India pose a big challenge to health systems due to the critical gaps in financial protection. India, like most of the LMICs, has relatively low levels of public expenditure on health and incomplete health insurance and health service coverage. The shortfall in public expenditure on health care is typically made by OOP and other private expenditures on health. The allocation of funding for NCD programming also remains low. Short-term vision, for the scope and duration of programs as well as funding, is the limiting factor for strong advocacy and call to action around NCDs. The current national insurance scheme, Ayushman Bharat, covers most of the key NCD- related surgical procedures and in-patient treatment but does not cover most outpatient or primary care services. Recommendations Advocate with the public sector for additional allocations and transparency in expenditure data. Work with existing private donors to develop holistic, inclusive, and comprehensive funding strategies that are patient-centered (rather than disease-centered). Build mechanisms for institutionalizing health stack funding, where various social security schemes (central and state) are bundled together, to provide a lump sum amount for NCDs and specifically cancer care. 3.6 Leadership and governance Challenges Lack of intersectoral, interdepartmental collaboration makes it difficult to tackle the growing burden of NCDs in a holistic fashion. There is a need for a strong policy framework that ensures all interventions directed toward NCDs are in sync and provide holistic care of the patient. Commercial interests influence policy development leading to a lack of regulation and guidelines around risk factors for NCDs (other than tobacco). Policy inertia, triggered by commercially driven interests (with the exception of tobacco, where strong advocacy efforts have led to strong regulations), has led to no regulations/guidelines around industries that heighten risk factors for NCDs. No defined platform exists for the private sector to engage with state-level governments. While the government has defined forums and platforms for engaging with the private sector/development partners/NGOs at a national level, no such mechanisms exist at the state level, which is the nerve center for a state's priorities. 33 India Noncommunicable Disease LandscapingRecommendations Support government development of a strong policy framework that ensures all NCD interventions provide holistic patient care. Strengthen multisector collaboration of government, industry, and communities through the various committees for NCD prevention and control to improve service delivery, financing, and infrastructure. Advocate for the production and sale of healthy food packages and introduction of sugar and salt tax for unhealthy food items. Advocate to increase the resource allocation for building NCD infrastructure, equipment (cancer treatment centers, etc.), and other interventions in states prioritized by disease burden. 3.7 Resilience during and after COVID-19 pandemic Challenges During the COVID-19 lockdown, NCD patients faced interruptions in medication procurement, access to health facilities, and maintenance of regular medical checkups due to a shortage of essential medicines, higher drug prices, and unavailability of government transportation. From March 2020 to September 2020, the public- and private-sector health care systems were geared and focused on prioritizing COVID-19 care. Patients with existing ailments postponed hospital visits and consultations due to fear of infections in health care facilities. During the lockdown, the NCD patients had faced many challenges, including interruption of day-to-day activities, such as routine exercise, limitations in venturing out to buy medicines, and the inability to reach testing centers and health centers, etc. In addition, shortages of essential medicines, higher prices of drugs, and unavailability of government transportation also affected the patients. Both the public and private sectors expanded telemedicine platforms for consultations, but these were inaccessible to patients without access to smartphones or internet. The public- and private-sector health care systems expanded services through telemedicine platforms for consultations. The public-sector platform was called the e-sanjeevani, and private-sector providers used commonly available platforms such as Zoom and WhatsApp video calls, but those without access to smartphones or personal devices were unable to access any form of care. Recommendations Integrate COVID-19 and NCD screening at primary and secondary levels of care and ensure patients are referred and linked to appropriate facilities for specialized care. Develop strategies for long-term follow-up of recovered COVID-19 patients with existing comorbidities by building up risk profiles for NCD patients. Increase outreach and awareness programs on COVID-19 complications for NCD patients. Implement community-based distribution of NCD medicines to address interruptions in access to medicines.34 India Noncommunicable Disease Landscaping1. Strengthen the roll out of NCD packages under the Comprehensive Primary Heath Care Program in rural areas Rationale: NCD care at the primary level is the need of the hour, especially in many rural areas where the public health care system is the sole source of medical care. COVID-19 has underscored the importance of ensuring people with existing co-morbidities receive timely and consistent care to prevent complications. Accelerate the roll out of NCD preventive, promotive, and treatment services for hypertension, diabetes, screening, and referral services for cancer and mental health. This can be operationalized using the following strategies: Adopt and implement innovative digital training modules for frontline workers. Design referral services from health and wellness centres to appropriate secondary and tertiary care to reduce delay in diagnosis and treatment. Assist the roll out of the National Health ID and Electronic Health Records Systems. Deploy easy-to-use and cost-effective point-of-care diagnostics. 2. Pilot NCD packages with private sector primary care providers in urban area Rationale: Primary care in the urban areas( especially the low-income localities) are dominated by general practitioners and non-allopathic physicians. They command a large loyal patient base for primary care issues due to their proximity to slums and low consultation costs. Design financial packages for out-patient care (diagnostics and drugs) of NCD conditions that can be managed at primary care levels. These financial packages could be in the form of pre-paid insurance plans /risk pooling to help lessen out-of-pocket expenditure in the long run. Build linkages to government systems for data sharing between the private and public sector. Develop systems for referral and long-term follow-up using digital technologies. Train CHWs and family members to support long-term follow-up and support treatment adherence. 3. Deploy comprehensive mental health services using digital health tools Rationale: It is estimated that nearly 7.5% of the population suffers from some mental disorder. COVID-19 has exacerbated and im- pacted mental health across the world. There is a huge shortage of psychiatrists and psychologists in the country as compared to the number of people suffering from mental health issues. Pilot hybrid models of in-person and digital mental health care to address the growing mental health burden in the country.Recommendations for investments 04 Analyzed through the lens of WHO building blocks and based on the study findings and our on-ground knowledge of the local health systems, we propose and recommend interventions to address some of the key barriers.35 India Noncommunicable Disease Landscaping Build the capacity of primary care physicians and community health volunteers to diagnose, treat, and refer patients for common mental health conditions. Design health promotion campaigns to fight the stigma against mental health 4. Build a comprehensive intervention for cervical cancer elimination and breast cancer care through public and private sectors Rationale: India contributes about 122,844 cervical cancer and 144,937 breast cancer cases every year and accounts for nearly one-third of the global cervical cancer deaths, with women facing a 1.6% cumulative risk of developing cervical cancer and 1.0% cumulative death risk from cervical cancer. Similarly, the cumulative risk of developing breast cancer is 2.7%, and cumulative death risk is 1.5%. Collaborate with the national and state governments and the private sector to build out a comprehensive intervention to improve awareness, strengthen screening services, and treatment of pre-cancerous lesions. 5. Build a comprehensive intervention to tackle the obesity epidemic Rationale: The latest National Family Health Survey indicates that 20 of 22 major states in India are seeing an increasing prevalence of obesity in adults and children. Obesity is associated with an elevated risk of several major NCDs, including type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, asthma, and several cancers. Hence, it is recommended to: Advocate with the Indian Food Safety Authorities to increase the visibility of obesity and related dangers. Design school-based programs for children, young adults, and caregivers to integrate good dietary practices and exercise in their daily routine. Pilot these models among school in low-income areas where the need is most pressing. 36 India Noncommunicable Disease LandscapingThe India NCD landscape assessment highlights important gaps in NCD care in all of WHO key health system building blocks and also identifies interventions to address these gaps. At a critical juncture, as India is looking to strengthen its UHC program, it is paramount to ensure that NCD services are provided at all levels and with the best possible standards of care. The COVID-19 epidemic exposed the fault lines of under-resourced primary health care settings and how primary health care and empowered health care workers and communities are key for health systems strengtheningConclusion 0537 India Noncommunicable Disease LandscapingAppendices38 India Noncommunicable Disease LandscapingAppendix 1.
