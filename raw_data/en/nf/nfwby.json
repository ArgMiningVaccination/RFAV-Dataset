The sounds of the forest the scent of the trees, the sunlight dappling through the leaves, the freshness and clean air. Being within nature is both relaxing and invigorating. A simple walk on the hills, along the beach or through the forest can be uplifting, great for our mental wellbeing, and is always refreshing whatever the weather. The topic of nature-healing sounds more like a fiction, a wellness wish list, rather than something based on scientific study. Until now. A group of Japanese researchers set out to discover whether something special and clinically therapeutic actually happens when we spend time in nature. 'Shinrin-yoku', or forest bathing, emerged in Japan during the 80s as a practice that benefits people on both a physiological and psychological level. Nature-healing, or Forest Bathing, is not exercise, or hiking, or jogging. It is simply being in nature, connecting with it through our senses of sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch, a meditation with Mother Earth . Even though the research is still ongoing, I think we can all agree from our own personal experiences that spending time within nature is certainly good for body and mind. In this edition, we would like to introduce you to some tranquil nature spots and natural wellness that will rejuvenate you, body and soul. Read on! Forest Healing Sagano Forest Kyoto, Japan The image of strolling in a sprawling bamboo forest as the sun sets, seems other-worldly or even as if it were a dream. A visit to Kyoto would not be complete without strolling in the Sagano Bamboo Forest for your forest healing. Only 30 minutes or so from downtown Kyoto, this majestic bamboo forest is a beautiful contrast to the urbanity surrounding it. Wooden paths weave through the dense thicket of tall bamboo stalks that reach dozens of feet into the sky, creating a vibrant green canopy overhead. As the wind passes through the tightly packed grass, the stalks bend and creak, the leaves rustle, and the woody trunks knock together, creating a peaceful sound like nothing else. The meditative sounds of nature, as if the bamboo forest is talking to you, will calm you. In fact, Japan's Ministry of the Environment designated the location's aural pleasures as one of the country's '100 Soundscapes of Japan', an initiative designed to encourage the local population to get out and appreciate the country's acoustic wonders. This is a must for any visit to Kyoto, the experience of the sound and vision of the bamboo forest is one of a kind. A Nature Walk at Flame of the Forest Madhya Pradesh For those looking to reconnect with nature, the Flame of the Forest Safari Lodge, set on 10 acres of private forest, has to be top of the list for places to stay in Madhya Pradesh. While you're at Flame of the Forest, you will have the rare opportunity to immerse yourself within the sounds, sights and smells of the forest on your doorstep. The owners also planted over 2,000 trees while building the lodge, playing a role both in local conservation and in the preservation of the forest environment. With activities like nature walks and village walks, each walk can be tailored to match guests' individual preferences. Personal and private, perhaps commune with nature by taking a guided birdwatching and butterfly walk, or a walk to learn more about the surrounding trees and insects. Guided visits to local tribal villages to learn about and experience the local culture is also possible.
