Together, this combination of modalities detoxes a congested lymph system; purify the waters: clear negative subconscious energetic blockages; 'pain body'; deposit immune cells; neuro-balance and the acute/chronic pain, inflammation, and muscle/visceral spasms. \"Body Mapping\" uses material diversity to stimulate sensory-motor neurons in the fingers through drawing an image which represents your 'self-image' and/or 'identity' . This neurological activation in the fingers translates up into the spinal cord and somatosensory cortex (parietal lobes) of the brain. As a result, creativity supports a 'relational neuroscience' integrating right and left brain functioning alongside strengthening the emotional experience of being listened to, 'compassionate inquiry' , and 'empathy' within the therapeutic relationship. The client is empowered to make wise and healthy choices that result from listening to the body's wisdom and being willing to creatively change and make meaning out of medical concerns. The inclusion of Phyto -Rx and Healium essential oil blends with MLD and Heat and/or Cold Hydrotherapy more rapidly detoxes cellular, organ, lymph, brain, and energetic levels. This ancient protocol increases dermal penetration of the plasma membrane with deeper skin absorption into the bloodstream and brain. As a result, there is decreased anxiety and depression; increased focus and concentration; dissolution of lung fibrosis; increased diaphragmatic breathing without bronchial spasms; increased sinus safe, natural, anti-fungal, and anti-inflammatory restorative option for cancer prevention and recovery. The scent of essential oils elicits a powerful positive emotional and self-caring response of 'feeling good' in the body; and demonstrates the effectiveness of pure, organic, and natural herbal remedies. Scent is easily inhaled and opens lung alveoli to reduce lung fibrosis and scarring due to a history of asthma. Scent also stimulates the olfactory system which is closely connected to the limbic brain or neural circuitry underlying anxiety and fear, i.e., hippocampus-long-term memory; amygdala-emotions; hypothalamus-autonomic nervous system and hormones; and cingulate gyrus-regulates blood pressure, heart rate, and attention. It is for this reason that essential oils have such a profound calming, neuro-balancing, and regulating effect on the physiological, visceral, emotional, psychological, and energetic systems. \"Body Mapping\" and MLD with Phyto-Rx and Healium essential oil blends is effective in the treatment of e.g. anxiety, depression, PTSD, Bi-polar personality disorder, ADHD, learning disability, grief, hypersensitivity, digestive problems, IBS, emotional eating disorder, sexual abuse, whiplash, DDD, asthma, sinusitis, scoliosis, trauma of being bullied, mastectomy, lumphectomy, lymphedema, lipedema, and cancer recovery. I will present 3 case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of \"Body Mapping\" and MLD with specific Phyto-Rx and Healium essential oil bends with a 14 year old girl with eczema; 46 year old woman and mother living with lipedema and lymphedema; and 56 year old woman and mother in cancer recovery.
