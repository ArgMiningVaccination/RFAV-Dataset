Maybe it is because it's getting warmer and we've dealt with a harsh winter, or the blossoming flowers, but I think people in the U.S. are more excited about something else other than the spring: the COVID-19 vaccine. [The New York Times ](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html)recently reported 31.8 million people have been affected by COVID-19 in the US as of April 2021. And the death toll is quite large as well, 568,000 Americans have passed away due to COVID; [in Illinois alone](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html) 1.3 million cases have been reported and almost 24 thousand have died due to the very contagious disease. Officials from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and the U.S. Food Drug Administration (FDA), respectively, announced that the vaccine would be available to the public in late December/early January. But throughout January, there were constant changes in the release of the vaccine, pushes and pulls from different organizations on how fast the vaccination should be pushed out or who should get it first. In my opinion, it seems that world leaders were just as confused on how the vaccine was sent out as the people ready to receive them. While many Americans received the vaccines around the late February and early March, there were reports of heavy side effects, mainly from the Johnson & Johnson vaccine after 100 million more doses of it had been ordered. [Side effects such as COVID like symptoms, fever, nausea, pain, redness, swelling, etc](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html). were reported. There were side effects shown from the Pfzier and Moderna vaccine as well, but not at the rate Johnson & Johnson effects were being reported. According to a report by [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/03/31/world/covid-19-coronavirus?), 15 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine spoiled due to an error at a production plant. The CDC paused releases of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine as of April 13 but have since allowed their release again. Dr. Janet Woodcock, U.S. Food Drug Administration acting commissioner, explained why the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was released again following the temporary stoppage, \"Both agencies have full confidence that this vaccine's known and potential benefits outweigh its known and potential risks in individuals 18 years and older.\" This has left many people suspicious of the protectiveness in the vaccine, especially college age students. Many schools/universities within the U.S. are making it mandatory for students to receive the vaccine in order to return back to in person learning. One of these universities is Chicago's own, Depaul University. [In a letter from the Depaul University Office of the President](https://resources.depaul.edu/newsline/sections/hey-students/Pages/COVID-19-vaccine-April-21.aspx), it states that \"In the spirit of caring for each other and for our surrounding community, DePaul has decided to require students to be vaccinated for COVID-19 when the 2021-22 academic year begins,\" leaving many students to work on getting their vax as soon as possible. Monique Petty, a sophomore in journalism at Depaul University, was very pleased with the swift mandatory ruling for students to receive the vaccine; however, she was worried about which vaccine she would get. \"I feel like there was such a rush with the vaccines being sent out that the CDC or whoever didn't really care about the after effects,\" said Petty. \"They just wanted to be the first to produce it. But I think it's great that the schools are making it mandatory to get [vaccinated], it makes sense. We say we wanna be in person, so we should all participate in making a safe way to be in person. I'm getting it.\" Receiving The Vax Being a student as well, I thought it would be smart and safe for me to get the 2021 solution as well. DePaul has provided students with assistance to schedule appointments and rides to receive the first or second dose. When I arrived at a space designated for administering the vaccine I don't know why I was surprised, but I was met with a long line to the street of students and others waiting for their dose. Eager to part-take in what will be known as history, students seemed excited to get poked in the arm and have their spring/summer back. I received my first dose of the Pfzier vaccine in my arm, it wasn't bad at all. The slight pinch meant nothing to the idea of a free and joyous spring/summer. Something I'm assuming everyone is looking forward to too. If you are looking to get vaccinated, or receive updates on the vaccine in Chicago, visit: "}
