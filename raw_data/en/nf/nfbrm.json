How much vitamin C should one take? There is an ongoing debate whether or not vitamin c is a prophylaxis against the flu and the common cold. This essential nutrient, though, is vital in essential bodily functions as well as regeneration. Vitamin C, which is also known as [ascorbic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C), is a nutrient that plays many important roles in the proper function and maintenance of your body. Vitamin C prevents disorders such as scurvy, but beyond that it is essential in the building and repair of the body's connective tissues. Connective tissues, specifically collagen, are proteins that help to form skin, ligaments, cartilage, bones, and teeth, as well as helping to maintain blood vessels and organs. The possible benefits of adequate vitamin C intake range from a reduced duration of the common cold to prevention of cardiovascular disease to possible cancer prevention. Many dermatologists also instruct their patients to apply topical vitamin C onto their skin to prevent free radical damage. "}
