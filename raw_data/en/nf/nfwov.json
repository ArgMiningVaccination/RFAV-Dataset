Participants were randomized 1:1 into 2 groups in Cohort 1: QIV-HD by IM route (n=5) and QIV-HD by SC route (n=5). After review of the local and systemic adverse events, the remaining 165 participants were enrolled (Cohort 2). Participants were randomized 1:1:1 into 3 groups in Cohort 2: QIV-HD by IM route (n=55), QIV-HD by Description:||QHD00008 was a modified double-blind study in which only the designated administrator at each study site knew which vaccine was administered to the participants. The participants and the Investigator/Sub-investigator in charge of the safety assessment were blinded in order to decrease the potential bias in safety assessment.| |Primary Purpose:||Prevention| |Official Title:||Safety Administered by Intramuscular or Subcutaneous Route in Participants Aged 65 Years and Older in Japan| |Actual Study Start Date :||September 15, 2017| |Actual Primary Date :||November by IM | Participants were randomized to receive a single 0.7-milliliter (mL) injection of QIV-HD by IM route on Day 0. | Biological: QIV-HD by IM | IM, injected into the upper arm (deltoid area) Other Name: High-Dose Influenza Vaccine Quadrivalent (IM) | Experimental: Cohort 1: QIV-HD by SC | Participants were randomized to receive a single 0.7 mL injection of QIV-HD by SC route on Day 0. | Biological: QIV-HD by SC | SC, injection into the upper (posterior region) Other Name: High-Dose Influenza Vaccine Quadrivalent (SC) | Experimental: Cohort 2: QIV-HD by IM | Participants were randomized to receive a single 0.7 mL injection of QIV-HD by IM route on Day 0. | Biological: QIV-HD by IM | IM, injected into the upper arm (deltoid area) Other Name: High-Dose Influenza Vaccine Quadrivalent (IM) | Experimental: Cohort 2: QIV-HD by SC | Participants were randomized to receive a single 0.7 mL injection of QIV-HD by SC route on Day 0. | Biological: QIV-HD by SC | SC, injection into the upper (posterior region) Other Name: High-Dose Influenza Vaccine Quadrivalent (SC) | Active Comparator: Cohort 2: QIV-SD by SC | Participants were randomized to receive a single 0.5 mL injection of QIV-SD by SC route on Day 0. | Biological: QIV-SD by SC | SC, injected into the upper arm (posterior region) Other Name: Standard-Dose Influenza Vaccine Quadrivalent - Number of Participants With Immediate Unsolicited Adverse Events (AE) After Vaccination [ Time Frame: Within 30 minutes after vaccination ]An unsolicited AE was an observed AE that did not fulfill the conditions prelisted in the case report book (CRB) in terms of symptom and/or onset post-vaccination. Unsolicited AEs includes both serious and non-serious unsolicited AEs. A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is an important medical event. All participants were observed for 30 minutes after vaccination, and any unsolicited AEs occurred during that time were recorded as immediate unsolicited AEs in the CRB. - Number of Participants With Solicited Injection Site and Systemic Reactions [ Time Frame: Within 7 days after vaccination ]A solicited reaction was an adverse reaction observed and reported under the conditions (symptom and onset) prelisted (i.e., solicited) in the CRB and considered as related to the administered vaccination. Solicited injection site reactions: pain, erythema, swelling, induration, and bruising. Solicited systemic reactions: fever, headache, malaise, myalgia, and shivering. - Number of Participants With Unsolicited Adverse Events After Vaccination [ Time Frame: Within 28 days after vaccination ]An unsolicited AE was an observed AE that does not fulfill the conditions prelisted in the CRB in terms of symptom and/or onset post-vaccination. Unsolicited AEs included both serious and non-serious unsolicited AEs. A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is an important medical event. - Number of Participant With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) After Vaccination [ Time Frame: Up to 6 months after vaccination ]An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is an important medical event. - Cohort 2: Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) of Influenza Antibodies Following Vaccination With QIV-HD or QIV-SD [ Time Frame: Day 0 (pre-vaccination) and Day 28 ]GMT of antibodies strains (A1, A1-like, A2, B2-like) were measured using a hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay. - Cohort 2: Geometric Mean Titer Ratios (GMTRs) of Influenza Antibodies Following Vaccination With QIV-HD or QIV-SD [ Time Frame: Day 0 (pre-vaccination) and Day 28 ]GMT of antibodies strains (A1, A1-like, A2, A2-like, B2, B2-like) were measured using an HAI assay. GMTRs were calculated as the ratio of GMTs post vaccination and pre-vaccination. - Cohort 2: Percentage of Participants Achieving Seroconversion Against Antigens Following Vaccination With QIV-HD or QIV-SD [ Time Frame: Day 28 (post-vaccination) ]Anti-influenza antibodies were measured by using the HAI assay for the strains A1, A1-like, A2, A2-like, B1, B2, and B2-like. Seroconversion was defined as either a HAI titer lesser than (<) 10 (1/dilution) at Day 0 and post-vaccination titer greater than or equal to (>=) 40 (1/dilution) at Day 28, or HAI titer >=10 (1/dilution) at Day 0 and a >=4-fold increase in HAI titer (1/dilution) at Day 28. - Cohort 2: Percentage of Participants Achieving Seroprotection Against Antigens Following Vaccination With QIV-HD or QIV-SD [ Time Frame: Day 0 (pre-vaccination) and Day 28 (post-vaccination) ]Anti-influenza antibodies were measured by using the HAI assay for the strains A1, A1-like, A2, A2-like, B1, B2, and B2-like. Seroprotection was defined as a HAI titer >=40 (1/dilution) at Day 0 and Day 28. Choosing to participate in a study is an important personal decision.
