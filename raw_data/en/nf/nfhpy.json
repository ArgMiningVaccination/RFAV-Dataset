KEITH CRYSTAL Being a chiropractor, I feel I have a big responsibility to my patients. That responsibility includes not only maximizing your nervous system for optimal health potential, which is what we are doing when we adjust you in your treatment; but also try to give you information about health from a different perspective than the traditional medical model. I believe the more information you have the better decisions you can make for you and your family`s health. I do not take these responsibilities lightly. Being chosen as \" Best Chiropractor of Sumner County \" is an honor. I appreciate each and every one of you as wonderful patients and more importantly as human beings. Whether you voted or not, thank you for your loyal support. Sincerely, Dr. Keith |Monday| |9:00 - 12:00, 2:00 - 6:00| |Tuesday| "}
